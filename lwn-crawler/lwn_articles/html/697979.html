<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 24, 2016</br>
           </div>
"Restartable sequences" is starting to look a bit like one of those bright
ideas that floats around on the kernel list for years, but which never
quite seems to make it into the mainline.  In this case, the idea was <a
href="/Articles/650333/">first proposed</a> over one year ago without, yet,
having made appreciable progress toward merging; activity on this patch set
died down after a while.  But development on
restartable sequences has picked up again under a new developer who has
come up with yet another API for the feature.
<p>
As has happened in the kernel, scalability pressures are driving some user-space
applications toward the use of lockless algorithms.  In kernel space, such
algorithms tend to be based on either disabling preemption or retrying an
operation after contention is detected.  Disabling preemption in user space
is not an option, so retries are the primary option remaining.  That is
where restartable sequences come in; they combine a kernel-facilitated
mechanism for detecting possible contention with a means to quickly force a
retry when contention happens.
<p>
The current version of restartable sequences, as <a
href="/Articles/697756/">posted</a> by Mathieu Desnoyers, retains the core
idea of its predecessors.  A restartable sequence is based around a short
segment of code; only the final instruction of that segment is allowed to
have side effects visible outside of the current thread.  There is also an
abort sequence, called to clean up and retry should the thread be preempted
while executing the sequence.  The specifics have changed, though.
<p>
Code using restartable sequences needs to start with an <tt>rseq</tt>
structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct rseq {
    	int32_t cpu_id;
	uint32_t event_counter;
        struct rseq_cs *rseq_cs;
    };
</pre>
<p>
(The actual structure is a bit more complex; various architecture-specific
details have been omitted here in the interest of readability.)

The <tt>cpu_id</tt> field always contains the number of the CPU on which
the thread is running; <tt>event_counter</tt> is incremented whenever the
thread is preempted â€” but only if <tt>rseq_cs</tt> is not null.  The
purpose of <tt>rseq_cs</tt> will be discussed below.
<p>
This structure must be registered with the kernel before restartable
sequences can be used; the operative system call is:
<p>
<pre>
    int rseq(struct rseq *rseq, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Only one <tt>rseq</tt> structure can be registered at a time in any given
thread, but that 
structure can be registered multiple times, and the kernel will keep track
of how many registrations (and unregistrations) there have been.
The <tt>flags</tt> argument must be zero when
registering a new structure.  Unregistration is done by passing a null
pointer for the <tt>rseq</tt> structure; setting <tt>flags</tt> to
<tt>RSEQ_FORCE_UNREGISTER</tt> will cause the immediate removal of the
structure, even if it has been registered multiple times.
<p>
In the past there have been concerns about how the restartable sequences
feature would work when there are multiple users within an application
(libraries, for example) that do not know about each other.  If those users
fight over which <tt>rseq</tt> structure is used, there will be problems
with this interface as well; if, instead, they can all agree on the same
structure, all will be well.  Restartable sequences must be simple, so it
makes no sense for code running within one to call another function at all,
much less one that would start its own sequence.  So there can only be a
single sequence running at any given time.
<p>
To ensure that all users share a single <tt>rseq</tt> structure, the
documentation recommends that each user declare it as a weak symbol and
name it <tt>__rseq_abi</tt>.  The linker will then ensure that, if there
are multiple declarations within a given program, they will all refer to
the same structure.
<p>
The other half of the puzzle is the <tt>rseq_cs</tt> structure pointed to
from within the <tt>rseq</tt> structure above.  This structure looks like
(again, with some simplification applied):
<p>
<pre>
    struct rseq_cs {
        void *start_ip;
	void *post_commit_ip;
	void *abort_ip;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure describes an actual critical section that runs in the
restartable mode.  Here, <tt>start_ip</tt> is the address of the first
instruction in the section, and <tt>post_commit_ip</tt> is the first
instruction beyond the end of the section; any code running between those two
instructions is running within the critical section.  The <tt>abort_ip</tt>
pointer is the address of the cleanup code to be executed should the
thread be preempted while executing within the section.
<p>
With those pieces, a restartable sequence is run using something like this
sequence of steps (assuming that the <tt>rseq</tt> structure is already
registered):
<p>
<ol class="spacylist">
<li> The <tt>event_counter</tt> field from the <tt>rseq</tt> structure
     is read and saved.
<li> The <tt>rseq_cs</tt> pointer in the <tt>rseq</tt> structure is
     set to point to the <tt>rseq_cs</tt> structure describing the critical
     section to be executed.
<li> The <tt>event_counter</tt> is read again and compared to the
     value read previously; if the values do not match, the
     <tt>rseq_cs</tt> field should be cleared and the process must be
     restarted from the beginning.
<li> The critical section can now be executed.  In most cases, only the
     final instruction in the critical section should have visible side
     effects.
<li> The <tt>rseq_cs</tt> field should be set to <tt>NULL</tt>.
</ol>
<p>
If execution makes it past the end of the section, then all is well.
If, instead, the thread is preempted while running within the critical
section, the 
kernel will cause it to jump to the <tt>abort_ip</tt> address.  The code
found there should clean up and prepare to retry.
<p>
In principle, that is all there is to it.  In practice, applications using
this feature must still include some assembly code to set up the various
instruction pointers; there is some complexity involved in making
it all work properly.  Those interested in examples can have a
look at <a href="/Articles/697990/">the self-tests</a> included with the
patch and, in particular, the rather frightening assembly-in-CPP code
found <a href="/Articles/697990/#do_rseq">here</a> and <a
href="/Articles/697990/#finish_asm">here</a>.
<p>
There have not been many comments on the implementation this time around;
it seems that, perhaps, things are finally getting to a point where the
developers who are paying attention are reasonably happy.  The next
obstacle, though, may be Linus, who <a href="/Articles/697991/">wants more
evidence</a> that this is a feature that will actually be used.  Convincing
him is likely to require demonstrating some real-world code that benefits
from the feature and benchmarks to prove that it is all worthwhile.  Since
restartable sequences are said to have been in use in places like Google
for some time, that proof should be possible to come by.  If the developers
involved follow through, perhaps this sequence of patches will not need to
be restarted too many more times.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>When our esteemed editor starts describing prospective kernel code as &quot;frightening&quot;, then I think it's time to really be scared.</p>

<p>In other words, don't try the self-tests without bracing yourself for possible blindness when browsing the code. ;-)</p>

<p>Regardless, this looks like a useful feature.  Hopefully it gains enough traction to make it in...</p>

      I guess I didn't make that clear enough.  The point is to let unrelated libraries all use this facility without stepping on each other's toes.  The kernel can only handle one such structure per thread, but, by allowing nested registration and through the use of the <tt>__rseq_abi</tt> trick, independent users can all get along.

I'd be concerned that this kind of mechanism can be used to get inappropriate access to data, by monitoring the number of restarts while setting things up so data you shouldn't have access to alters the probability of getting restarted.<br>

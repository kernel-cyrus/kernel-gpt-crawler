<h1>Is CKRM worth it?</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Anytime your editor gives a talk on kernel development efforts, there seems
to be one project which inspires scattered boos and hisses from the audience.  The
lucky project this year was Class-based Kernel Resource Management (CKRM).
The CKRM patches have been under development for some time, and the
developers involved have been pushing for inclusion.  The future of the
CKRM patches seems uncertain, however; there is significant opposition to
them being merged.
<p>

The idea behind CKRM is to give system administrators a high degree of
control over how the resources on a system are used.  To that end, it puts
every process into a "class," then applies rules specifying which resources
are available to each class.  On the classification side, CKRM includes a
rule-based classification engine which can pigeonhole processes in a number
of ways: its user or group IDs, the command it is running, which ports it
is listening to, etc.  Classification engines are pluggable, however, so a
site with specific needs could write its own.  It is also possible for an
administrator to directly shove 
a process into a given class by way of a virtual filesystem interface.
<p>

The controlling side regulates how much of the system each class can use.
Maximum limits can be applied, in a way similar to the resource limits
built into the kernel now.  There is also a mechanism for specifying a
"guarantee," a minimum amount of resource which will be allocated to a
class.  So an administrator can set things up such that the web server will
not take more than half the CPU, or that the X server will always get at
least 20% if it needs it.
<p>

That leads to another component of CKRM: controllers.  Each controller
manages the allocation of one specific resource in the system.  CPU usage
is regulated by the CPU controller; as it happens, the CKRM patches in the
-mm tree do not currently include that controller.  The CPU controller
extends its fingers fairly deeply into the Linux scheduler, and the
developers do not feel that it is ready for inclusion quite yet.  In fact,
the only controllers currently in -mm handle the total number of tasks and
the rate at which processes can fork.  Many other controllers are in
development, handling resources like main memory, disk I/O bandwidth,
network bandwidth, and more.

<p>
The CKRM patches are large - over 14,000 lines in -mm.  They also must
place hooks into many sensitive parts of the kernel in order to be able to
monitor process transitions and enforce resource limits and guarantees.
Any patch which digs into parts of the core kernel in this way is going to
see a fair amount of scrutiny, and CKRM is no exception.  In this case,
many developers see CKRM as an overly complex subsystem which is aimed at
the needs of the customers of one specific vendor.  Most Linux users simply
do not need to have such fine-grained control over resource usage on their
systems.
<p>

CKRM looks like a bit of a long-term maintenance headache as well.  Every
subsystem which requires distributing hooks around the kernel (think of the
Linux security modules, the audit subsystem, or inotify as other subsystems
of this type) is essentially overlaying a new structure on top of the base
kernel.  Any changes to the kernel must be done carefully so that none of
the overlaid structures will break.  So each one of these structures makes
kernel programming a little harder; it is one more thing a developer must
keep in mind when making changes.  Mix in the fact that most kernel
developers (and testers, for that matter) will not have CKRM configured
into their kernels, and it becomes clear that a subsystem like CKRM could
turn out to be relatively fragile.
<p>

Supporters of CKRM see it as a useful tool for the management of larger
systems (they see applications for smaller systems as well).  In
particular, it can be used with virtualization systems (Xen or
UML, for example) to consolidate servers onto a smaller hardware base while
providing appropriate resource guarantees for the guest servers.  Thus, <a
href="/Articles/145159/">says Gerrit Huizenga</a>, CKRM can be thought of
as part of the "eco-computing movement."  CKRM imposes no overhead on the
system if it is configured out, and almost no overhead if it is built in
but not used.  Since CKRM is useful for some users, and stays out of the
way for the rest, it is worth adding to the kernel.
<p>

For now, CKRM is in -mm for people to play with; Andrew Morton has noted
that it is not, yet, on a path toward inclusion in the near future.  He
<a href="/Articles/145160/">wants to see a real debate</a>, however, and
not a simple, offhand rejection:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But there's been a lot of work put into this and if we're to flatly
	reject the feature then the developers are owed a much better
	reason than "eww yuk".
</div>
<p>

So far, that reason has not been provided in any definitive way.  So expect
to see this topic come up again as the developers try to get a real answer
on whether CKRM is headed for the mainline or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Interesting. Any documentation on how to use this? Is CKRM somehow related to the earlier QLinux effort? <br>

      I am not a kernel developer, nor will I probably ever be one, but what would the feasibility be for creating a generic hook system be? <br>
<p>
It seems that with so many different subsystems being overlayed, that a "unified/generic hook system", or something akin to it, would be a good idea. Kernel developers would only need to manage that aspect, and leave it to the other projects to implement systems that utilize it.<br>
<p>
Again, this is stated without any in-depth knowledge of linux kernel systems... only what I have managde to pick up reading LWN for the past year or so.<br>

<p>
The kernel self-test framework (<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kselftest.html">kselftest</a>) 
has been a part of the kernel for some time now; a relatively recent
proposal for a <a href="/Articles/780985/">kernel unit-testing framework</a>,
called <a
href="https://google.github.io/kunit-docs/third_party/kernel/docs/">KUnit</a>,
has left some wondering why both exist.  In a lengthy discussion thread  about
KUnit, the justification for adding another testing
framework to the kernel was debated.  While there are different use cases
for kselftest and KUnit, there was concern about fragmenting the kernel-testing
landscape.
</p>

<p>
In early May, Brendan Higgins posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190501230126.229218-1-brendanhiggins@google.com/">v2
of the KUnit patch set</a> with an eye toward getting it into Linux 5.2.
That was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190502105053.GA12416@kroah.com/">deemed</a> a bit
of an overaggressive schedule by Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/76e84d54-6b7e-8cc1-492b-43822fc43ac4@kernel.org/">and
Shuah Khan</a> given that the merge 
window would be opening a week later or so.  But Khan did agree that the
patches could come in via her kselftest tree.  There were some technical
objections to some of the patches, which is no surprise, but overall the
patches were met with approvalâ€”and some Reviewed-by tags.
</p>

<p>
There were some sticking points, however.  Several, including Kroah-Hartman
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ea36c3d6-8c13-2186-16f3-596d834aeebe@deltatee.com/">and
Logan Gunthorpe</a> complained about the reliance on user-mode Linux (UML)
to run the tests.  Higgins <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAFd5g46RyQ+jaV3bDejBaeca4Yv3G9ppT5JxdKqZw6PSbiSDYw@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that he had "<q>mostly fixed that</q>".  The KUnit tests will now run
on any architecture, though the Python wrapper scripts are still expecting
to run the tests in UML.  He said that he should probably document that,
which is something that he has <a
href="https://google.github.io/kunit-docs/third_party/kernel/docs/usage.html#kunit-on-non-uml-architectures">subsequently
done</a>. 
</p>

<p>
A more overarching concern was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/54940124-50df-16ec-1a32-ad794ee05da7@gmail.com/">raised</a>
by Frank Rowand.  From his understanding, using UML is meant to
"<q>avoid booting a kernel on 
real hardware or in a virtual machine</q>", he said, but he does not
really see that as anything other than "<q>a matter of
semantics</q>";  running Linux via UML is simply a different form of
virtualization.  Furthermore:
<div class="BigQuote">
It seems to me that KUnit is just another piece of infrastructure that I
am going to have to be familiar with as a kernel developer.  More overhead,
more information to stuff into my tiny little brain.
<p>
I would guess that some developers will focus on just one of the two test
environments (and some will focus on both), splitting the development
resources instead of pooling them on a common infrastructure.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Khan <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1b1efa91-0523-21a9-e541-fdc3612bd117@kernel.org/">replied</a>
that she sees kselftest and KUnit as complementary.  Kselftest is "<q>a
collection of user-space tests with a 
few kernel test modules back-ending the tests in some cases</q>", while KUnit
provides a framework for in-kernel testing.  Rowand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/911e44bb-9bb1-e603-a260-fac63760fff6@gmail.com/">was
not particularly swayed</a> by that argument, however.  He sees that there
is (or could be) an almost complete overlap between the two.
</p>

<p>
Unlike some other developers, Ted Ts'o actually finds the use of UML to be
beneficial.  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190507172256.GB5900@mit.edu/">described</a> some
unit tests that are under development for ext4; they will test certain
features of ext4 in isolation from any other part of the kernel, which is
where he sees the value in KUnit.  The framework provided with kselftest
targets running tests from user space, which requires booting a real kernel,
while KUnit is simpler and faster to use:
<div class="BigQuote">
So this is why it's largely irrelevant to me that KUinit uses UML.  In
fact, it's a feature.  We're not testing device drivers, or the
scheduler, or anything else architecture-specific.  UML is not about
virtualization.  What it's about in this context is allowing us to
start running test code as quickly as possible.  Booting KVM takes
about 3-4 seconds, and this includes initializing virtio_scsi and
other device drivers.  If by using UML we can hold the amount of
unnecessary kernel subsystem initialization down to the absolute
minimum, and if it means that we can [communicate] to the test
framework via a userspace "printf" from UML/KUnit code, as opposed to
via a virtual serial port to KVM's virtual console, it all makes for
lighter weight testing.
</div>
</p>

<h4>Frameworks</h4>

<p>
Part of the difference of opinion may hinge on the definition of
"framework" to a certain extent.  Ts'o stridently argued that kselftest is
not providing an in-kernel testing framework, but Rowand just as vehemently
disagreed with that.  Rowand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/a09a7e0e-9894-8c1a-34eb-fc482b1759d0@gmail.com/">pointed</a>
to the use of kernel modules in kselftest and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/6d6e91ec-33d3-830b-4895-4d7a20ba7d45@gmail.com/">noted</a>
that those modules can be built into a UML kernel.  Ts'o <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190509015856.GB7031@mit.edu/">did not think</a>
that added up to a framework since "<q>each of
the in-kernel code has to create their own in-kernel test
infrastructure</q>".  Rowand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/78e4d46e-6212-9871-51d6-dd2126f39d45@gmail.com/">sees
that differently</a>:
"<q>The kselftest in-kernel tests follow a common pattern.  As such, there
is a framework.</q>"
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190510104338.GB6889@mit.edu/">To Ts'o</a>, that
doesn't really equate to a framework, though perhaps the situation
could change down the road:
<div class="BigQuote">
So we may have different definitions of "framework".  In my book, code
reuse by "cut and paste" does not make a framework.  Could they be
rewritten to *use* a framework, whether it be KTF [Kernel Test Framework]
or KUnit?  Sure! 
But they are not using a framework *today*.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In addition, Ts'o <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190509214233.GA20877@mit.edu/">said</a> that
kselftest expects to have a working user-space environment:
<div class="BigQuote">
One major difference: kselftest requires a userspace environment; it
starts systemd, requires a root file system from which you can load
modules, etc.  Kunit doesn't require a root file system; doesn't
require that you start systemd; doesn't allow you to run arbitrary
perl, python, bash, etc. scripts.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Rowand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/80c72e64-2665-bd51-f78c-97f50f9a53ba@gmail.com/">disagreed</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
 Kselftest in-kernel tests (which
is the context here) can be configured as built in instead of as
a module, and built in a UML kernel.  The UML kernel can boot,
running the in-kernel tests before UML attempts to invoke the
init process.
<p>
No userspace environment needed.  So exactly the same overhead
as KUnit when invoked in that manner.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Ts'o is <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190511173344.GA8507@mit.edu/">not
convinced</a> by that.  He noted that the kselftest documentation is
missing any mention of this kind of test.  There are tests that run
before init is started, but they aren't part of the kselftest framework:
<div class="BigQuote">
There exists test modules in the kernel that run before the init
scripts run --- but that's not strictly speaking part of kselftests,
and do not have any kind of infrastructure.  As noted, the
kselftests_harness header file fundamentally assumes that you are
running test code in userspace.
</div>
</p>

<h4>Overlaps</h4>

<p>
There may be overlaps in the functionality of KUnit and kselftest,
however. Knut Omang, who is part of the <a
href="https://github.com/oracle/ktf">Kernel Test Framework</a> 
projectâ€”another unit-testing project for the kernel that is not upstreamâ€”<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/7fd35df81c06f6eb319223a22e7b93f29926edb9.camel@oracle.com/">pointed
out</a> that there are two types of tests that are being conflated a bit in
the discussion.  One is an isolated test of a particular subsystem that is
meant to be run rapidly and repeatedly by developers of that subsystem.
The other is meant to test interactions between more than one subsystem and
might be run as part of a regression test suite or in a
continuous-integration effort, though it would be used by developers as
well.  The unit tests being developed for ext4 would fall into the first
category, while xfstests would fall into the latter.
</p>

<p>
Omang said that the two could potentially be combined into a single tool,
with common configuration files, test reporting, and so on.  That is what
KTF is trying to do, he said.  But Ts'o is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190509133551.GD29703@mit.edu/">skeptical</a> that
a single test framework is the way forward.  There are already multiple
frameworks out there, he said, including xfstests, blktests, kselftest, and
so on.  Omang also suggested that UML was still muddying the waters in
terms of single-subsystem unit tests:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] the problem with using UML is that you still have to
relate to the complexity of a kernel run time system, while what you really
want for these 
types of tests is just to compile a couple of kernel source files in a
normal user land 
context, to allow the use of Valgrind and other user space tools on the
code. The 
challenge is to get the code compiled in such an environment as it usually
relies on 
subtle kernel macros and definitions, which is why UML seems like such an
attractive 
solution.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Ts'o sees things differently:
<div class="BigQuote">
"Just compiling a couple of kernel source files in a normal user land"
is much harder than you think.  It requires writing vast numbers of
mocking functions --- for a file system I would have to simulate the
block device layer, large portions of the VFS layer, the scheduler and
the locking layer if I want to test locking bugs, etc., etc.  In
practice, UML itself is serving as [the] mocking layer, by its mere
existence.  So when Frank says that KUnit doesn't provide any mocking
functions, I don't at all agree.  Using KUnit and UML makes testing
internal interfaces *far* simpler, especially if the comparison is
"just compile some kernel source files as part of a userspace test
program".
</div>
</p>

<p>
Gunthorpe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/b09ba170-229b-fde4-3e9a-e50d6ab4c1b5@deltatee.com/">saw
some potential overlap</a> as well.  He made a distinction in test styles
that was somewhat similar to Omang's.  He noted that there are not many
users of the <tt>kselftest_harness.h</tt> interface at this point, so it
might make sense to look at unifying the areas that overlap sooner rather than
later.
<div class="BigQuote">
The second item, arguably, does have significant overlap with
kselftest. Whether you are running short tests in a light weight UML
environment or higher level tests in an heavier VM the two could be using
the same framework for writing or defining in-kernel tests. It *may* also
be valuable for some people to be able to run all the UML tests in the
heavy VM environment along side other higher level tests.
<p>
Looking at the selftests tree in the repo, we already have similar items to
what Kunit is adding as I described in point (2) above. kselftest_harness.h
contains macros like EXPECT_* and ASSERT_* with very similar intentions to
the new KUNIT_EXECPT_* and KUNIT_ASSERT_* macros.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Ts'o <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190509233043.GC20877@mit.edu/">is not
opposed</a> to unifying the tests in whatever way makes sense, but said
that <tt>kselftest_harness.h</tt> needs to be reworked before in-kernel
tests can use it.  Gunthorpe seemed to change his mind some when he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/8914afef-1e66-e6e3-f891-5855768d3018@deltatee.com/">replied</a>
that perhaps the amount of work to unify the two use cases was not worth
it:
<div class="BigQuote">
Using kunit for in-kernel
tests and kselftest_harness for userspace tests seems like a sensible line
to draw to me. Trying to unify kernel and userspace here sounds like it
could be difficult so it's probably not worth forcing the issue unless
someone wants to do some really fancy work to get it done.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, what <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/875c546d-9713-bb59-47e4-77a1d2c69a6d@gmail.com/">Rowand
seems to be after</a> is a better justification for 
KUnit and why it is, and needs to be, different from kselftest, in the patch
series itself.  "<q>I was looking for a fuller, better explanation than
was given in patch 0 
of how KUnit provides something that is different than what kselftest
provides for creating unit tests for kernel code.</q>"  Higgins <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190514083819.GC230665@google.com/">asked</a> for
specific suggestions on where the documentation of KUnit was lacking.
Rowand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5ff098a9-9424-901c-9017-d4492e306528@gmail.com/">replied</a>
that in-patch justification is what he, as a code reviewer, was looking
for:
<div class="BigQuote">
One thing that has become very apparent in the discussion of this patch
series is that some people do not understand that kselftest includes
in-kernel tests, not just userspace tests.  As such, KUnit is an
additional implementation of "the same feature".  (One can debate
exactly which in-kernel test features kselftest and KUnit provide,
and how much overlap exists or does not exist.  So don't take "the
same feature" as my final opinion of how much overlap exists.)  So
that is a key element to be noted and explained.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Gunthorpe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/8c693b9f-43ec-8982-825c-cabfd61b659d@deltatee.com/">did
not agree</a>; "<q>in my
opinion, Brendan has provided over and above the information required to
justify Kunit's inclusion</q>".  The difference of opinion about whether
kselftest provides any kind of in-kernel framework appears to be the crux
of the standoff.  Gunthorpe believes that the in-kernel kselftest code
should probably be changed to use KUnit, once it gets merged, which he was
strongly in favor of.
</p>

<p>
As the discussion was trailing off, Higgins 
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190514054251.186196-1-brendanhiggins@google.com/">posted
v3 of the patch set</a> on May&nbsp;13, followed closely by an
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190514221711.248228-1-brendanhiggins@google.com/">update
to v4</a> a day later.
Both addressed the technical comments on the v2 code and also added the
documentation about running on architectures other than UML.
There have been relatively few comments and no
major complaints about those postings.  One might guess that KUnit is on
its way into the mainline, probably for 5.3.

To add some context to my email that was originally quoted:<br>
<p>
I am in favour of using UML, however when I tried to use KUnit I ran into a bunch of problems being able to compile my tests at all seeing the tree I wrote a test for wouldn't compile without PCI being selected and that could not be done in UML. I managed to work around it but I suspect there's going to be a lot of these problems in the future [1].<br>
<p>
I think the consensus at the time was roughly that we'd need to add more mocking to UML to allow these subsystems to use it, not to stop using UML entirely.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, my position regarding kselftests changed during the course of the discussion because it wasn't clear what kselftests actually provides or where the in-kernel tests were (they are in lib/test*). There's very little documentation for kselftests and they seem to cover a bunch of different cases. In contrast, documentation is one of the things KUnit has done very well.<br>

From my point of view as a kselftest user, the difference is in the purpose of the tools. <br>
kselftest is meant to detect any API break and make sure not to break userspace, on the other hand KUnit test is meant for testing specific parts of the kernel and possibly parts that are not exposed to userspace or at least not directly.<br>
<p>
Roughly speaking, for me it is the difference between unit tests and functional tests, and in most userspace-centric project these two uses different frameworks as they don't have the same needs, the only common thing is usually the output format.<br>
<p>
And here again, in a project as big as the kernel the limit can be blurry as you might want to functionally test an entire subsystem that is not directly exposed to userspace. <br>
And for this point there might be need for a third framework to keep things clear and avoid getting a bloated framework or unreadable/unmaintainable tests.<br>
<p>
Something like:<br>
- kselftest for userspace interface functional testing<br>
- KUnit for kernel features unit testing<br>
- ???? for in-kernel features functional testing<br>
<p>
With the three sharing the same output format and the functional tests sharing the same way of writing scenarios seems like the most sane way to go.<br>
With a well-defined structure you can make unit-tests mandatory for every patch set and functional-tests mandatory for inclusion in "main" tree. A set of tests like this is needed to build more trust in stable kernels.<br>

<p>
I rarely ever saw such a clear limit - in any project. Even with the best and clearest definitions there are always grey areas and overlaps somewhere in the middle. Not an exact science.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;it is the difference between unit tests and functional tests</font><br>
Conventionally, unit tests *are* functional tests. Harnessing program logic in its own scope is unit testing; the tests themselves measure* the functionality. You're also mistaking the API conformity suite for being unit tests: they're integration tests simply becuase they ask "will these components play nicely together?"<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; And for this point there might be need for a third framework to keep things clear and avoid getting a bloated framework or unreadable/unmaintainable tests.</font><br>
Convention holds that the phrases you want to use are 'separation of concerns' for having tests appropriate to the layer of production functionality you want to measure* and 'single responsibility principle' for having production and test code do only one thing (hopefully well) -- and that single responsibility for the test code is to measure* the outcome of a single change in one layer of the system.<br>
<p>
*: I've starred 'measure' each time I used it because I talk about testing in terms of taking measurements aimed to accept or reject a falsifiable hypothesis about the system. We talk about preparing the system, then making a single change, and measuring the impact. And we also talk about the layers of these tests: the 'testing pyramid' I prefer to use is one of a base of super-quick and super-numerous, whose output you trust when assessing whether the components will integrate properly as their interfaces work to explicit interface contracts, and then external interfaces (user and programmatic) becoming more expensive because they require more setup and levels to the stack to be representative of real-world use (which is balanced by the harness being lightweight because you're building on the trust of the lower levels of your testing); and finally, the smoke tests of "did we deploy it right?"<br>

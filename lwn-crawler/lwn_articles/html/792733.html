<p>The Android system has shipped a couple of allocators for DMA buffers
over the years; first came <a 
href="https://elinux.org/Android_Kernel_Features#pmem">PMEM</a>, then its
replacement <a href="/Articles/480055/">ION</a>.  The ION allocator has
been in use since around 2012, but it remains stuck in the kernel's staging
tree.  The 
work to <a href="/Articles/565469/">add ION to the mainline</a> started in 2013;
at that time, the allocator had multiple issues that made inclusion
impossible. Recently, John Stultz <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190624194908.121273-1-john.stultz@linaro.org/">posted
a patch set</a> introducing DMA-BUF heaps, an evolution of ION, that is
designed to do exactly that &mdash; get the Android DMA-buffer allocator to
the mainline Linux kernel.

<p>Applications interacting with devices often require a memory
buffer that is shared with the device driver. Ideally, it would be
memory mapped and physically contiguous, allowing direct DMA access and minimal
overhead when accessing the data from both sides at the same time. ION's
main goal is to support that use case; it implements a unified way of
defining and 
sharing such memory buffers, while taking into account the constraints
imposed by the devices and the platform.</p>

<p>ION provides a number of memory pools, called "heaps", that have different
properties, like whether they are physically contiguous. These heaps
include the "system" heap, containing
memory allocated via <tt>vmalloc_user()</tt>, the
"system_contig" heap, which uses <tt>kzalloc()</tt>, and the
"carveout" heap, managing a physically contiguous region set aside at
boot. The user-space API allows applications to allocate, free, and share
buffers from any of these heaps.</p> 

<p>ION was developed, out of tree, in parallel with in-tree kernel APIs like <a
href="/Articles/474819/">DMA buffer sharing (DMA-BUF)</a> and the <a
href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous memory allocator (CMA)</a>. It
naturally
duplicates parts of their functionality. In addition, as ION's first
platform was Android on 32-bit ARM processors, it used ARM-specific kernel
APIs when there were no generic ones available. This obviously
did not help the upstreaming process.

The new DMA-BUF heaps patch set is a complete rework of the ION
internals: it uses CMA to implement a physically contiguous heap from a
special memory zone and it does not make use of any architecture-specific
functions.
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190607030719.77286-6-john.stultz@linaro.org/">A
self-test included</a> with the patch set presents the API.</p>

<h4>Heaps and allocations</h4>

<p>Each heap is represented by a special file in the <tt>/dev/dma_heap</tt>
directory; an application will open a specific heap file to be able to
allocate from that heap.
The allocations are done using the <tt>DMA_HEAP_IOC_ALLOC</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt> on 
the resulting file descriptor. This command takes one parameter, a pointer to
a <tt>dma_heap_allocation_data</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct dma_heap_allocation_data {
        __u64 len;
        __u32 fd;
        __u32 fd_flags;
        __u64 heap_flags;
        __u32 reserved0;
        __u32 reserved1;
    };
</pre>
<p><tt>len</tt> is the size of the desired allocation in bytes.
<tt>fd</tt> should be set to zero when setting up the structure; it will be
filled 
in by the <tt>DMA_HEAP_IOC_ALLOC</tt> operation with a file descriptor
representing the allocated 
DMA-BUF. <tt>fd_flags</tt> describes how the file descriptor will be set
up (the valid flags are <tt>O_CLOEXEC</tt>, <tt>O_RDONLY</tt>,
<tt>O_WRONLY</tt>, and <tt>O_RDWR</tt>) and <tt>heap_flags</tt> stores the
flags passed to the heap allocator; it should be set to zero. Finally, there are
two reserved fields that should also be set to zero. The <tt>ioctl()</tt>
returns zero when the allocation is successful.</p>

<p>To access the allocated memory, the application needs to call
<tt>mmap()</tt> on the returned buffer file descriptor.
When the buffer is no longer needed, the user code should close its file
descriptor, which will free the 
allocated memory.</p> 

<p>To summarize, each heap used by an application has an associated file
descriptor, as does every allocated buffer. The buffer handles in DMA-BUF
heaps are generic DMA-BUF handles that can be passed to drivers that
understand such buffers. This API differs from the original ION
approach, where there was one centralized special file for the allocator
itself, and separate non-standard handles for the buffers. There was also a
specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> to share the memory that does not exist in DMA-BUF
heaps.</p>

<h4>Memory access synchronization</h4>

<p>One of the complex issues when handling a buffer that is shared between
devices 
and CPUs is deciding who can access it at any given time. This is
because of the caches: a processor's accesses typically involve the cache,
while device accesses may not. Concurrent access may cause a mismatch
between the cache and memory, 
leading to data corruption.  To handle this issue, the drivers and
applications must declare when they need to access shared memory for reading
or writing; this allows the kernel to manage the caches correctly.</p>

<p>The original ION did not handle synchronization; DMA-BUF heaps
uses the DMA-BUF API directly for this purpose.  Synchronization is
controlled by the <tt>DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt>, which takes a structure with flags to describe the
synchronization type. Before accessing the
shared buffer, user code should use the <tt>DMA_BUF_SYNC_START</tt> flag
with the required access mode (<tt>DMA_BUF_SYNC_READ</tt>,
<tt>DMA_BUF_SYNC_WRITE</tt>, or <tt>DMA_BUF_SYNC_RW</tt>, which is a
combination of the two). When the access is finished, it should use
<tt>DMA_BUF_SYNC_END</tt> with the same access-mode flags.</p>

<h4>Available heaps and adding new ones</h4>

<p>The implementation uses a modular approach to the heaps; it defines
a general framework that is used by each specific heap implementation. The patch
set offers two heap types: the system heap using <tt>alloc_page()</tt> and
the "cma" 
heap using the CMA allocator (if available in the system).</p>

<p>As in the original ION, it is up to the application developer to choose
the right heap, which must correspond to the requirements of all the devices
involved. This is a limitation, but the problem is complicated and
currently no mainline solution exists. In embedded systems,
where DMA heaps will most likely be used, the hardware
configuration is fixed, so that the memory constraints of the devices are known
in advance.</p>

<p>Kernel developers are given a framework to add more heaps, which 
currently can only be done at boot time. Each heap needs to fill the operations
structure and the export structure.
The operations structure, <tt>struct dma_heap_ops</tt>, is currently
simple, containing a single function:</p>

<pre>
    struct dma_heap_ops {
        int (*allocate)(struct dma_heap *heap,
                        unsigned long len,
                        unsigned long fd_flags,
                        unsigned long heap_flags);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The export structure has the following format:
<p>
<pre>
    struct dma_heap_export_info {
        const char *name;
        struct dma_heap_ops *ops;
        void *priv;
    };
</pre>
<p><tt>name</tt> is the name of the heap, <tt>ops</tt> is the pointer to
the operations structure shown above, and the <tt>priv</tt> is a place
for heap-specific data. The parameters exactly match the structure of the
<tt>DMA_HEAP_IOC_ALLOC</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt>; the allocator should return
the file 
descriptor of the allocated DMA-BUF.</p>

<p>After filling out the two structures, the heap implementation needs to
add the heap using:</p>
<pre>
    struct dma_heap *dma_heap_add(const struct dma_heap_export_info *exp_info);
</pre>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Since the time ION was first introduced, the Linux kernel has gained generic
functionality that can be now used in the new implementation. The DMA-BUF
heaps interface is simple, and the patch set intentionally leaves out
certain functionalities (including a few heap types) and performance
optimizations. Its goal is to define the API; the optimizations and new
functionalities are expected to come later. A logical next step is the
optimization of allocation performance. Stultz has the patches ready, but
decided not to include them in the submission to simplify the review
process.  Allocation performance is expected to be similar to or even
better than the original ION.</p>

<p>The patch set is currently in its sixth version and the simple, step-by-step 
approach seems to be working; the discussions show no major
controversies. We can expect that the new API may appear in the kernel
soon.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

So the ION interfaces are usually accessed via vendor specific gralloc HAL code, so its not something we can shift all of AOSP to in one step.  Each vendor has to move their out of tree ION heap implementations over and also rework their custom gralloc HAL to use the new API, so there will likely be a transition period.  I've got such an gralloc implementation ready to be submitted to AOSP for the HiKey960 board already so there will be a reference example.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'd like to see the vendor specific gralloc HAL be replaced with a generic implementation with a fstab style config file that simply maps buffer usage to heap name, so vendors only have to provide that config file, but I know there is always hesitancy to remove the ability for the vendors to have fully custom HAL implementations, so that may not be widely adopted.<br>
<p>
I have been keeping the Google developers in the loop, and there has been no objections, and they do seem motivated to get vendors to to use proper upstream kernel interfaces, so while I can't speak for them, I believe they are on board with this new API.<br>

(disclosure: I am not an android dev; just a user)<br>
<p>
Aww, I didn't realize that there was a hal between surface flinger and the kernel. I suppose that means the kernel buf interface is essentially outside the scope of AOSP, in that the gralloc implementation could be anything so long as the GSI boots?<br>

<p>
If I remember correctly, the gralloc implementation is responsible for calculating the sizes of image buffers, which might be in some vendor-specific GPU-efficient tiled layout with funny padding etc. mali_gralloc_ion.cpp has the AFBC code too. That kind of logic wouldn't fit in a config file, so I don't see how you can get away from needing a vendor-specific gralloc implementation.<br>

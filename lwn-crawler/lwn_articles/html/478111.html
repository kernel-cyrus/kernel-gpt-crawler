<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 31, 2012</br>
           </div>
The addition of a checkpoint/restore functionality to Linux has been an
ongoing topic of discussion and development for some years now.  After the
<a href="/Articles/414264/">poor reception</a> given to the in-kernel C/R
implementation at the end of 2010, that particular project seems to have
faded into the background.  Instead, most of the interest seems to be in
solutions that operate mostly in user space.  Depending on the approach
taken, most or all the support needed to implement this functionality in
user space already exists.  But a complete solution is not yet there.
<p>
<h4>CRIU</h4>
<p>
Cyrill Gorcunov has been working to fill in some of the gaps with <a
href="/Articles/478117/">a preparatory patch set</a> for user-space
checkpointing/restore with the "CRIU" tool set.  There are a number of
small additions to the kernel ABI to be found here:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A new <tt>children</tt> entry in a thread's <tt>/proc</tt> directory 
     provides a list of that thread's immediate children.  This information
     allows a user-space checkpoint utility to find those child processes
     without needing to walk through the entire process tree.
<p>
<li> <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/stat</tt> is extended to provide the bounds of
     the process's argument and environment arrays, along with the exit
     code.  That allows this information to be reliably captured at
     checkpoint time.
<p>
<li> A number of new <tt>prctl()</tt> options allow the argument and
     environment arrays to restored in a way matching what was there at
     checkpoint time.  The desired end result is that <tt>ps</tt> shows the
     same information about a process after a checkpoint/restore cycle as
     it did before.
</ul>
<p>
Perhaps the most significant new feature, though, is the addition of a new
system call:
<p>
<pre>
    long kcmp(pid_t pid1, pid_t pid2, int type, unsigned long idx1, unsigned long idx2);
</pre>
<p>
Checkpoint/restore is meant to work as well on a tree of processes as on a
single process.  One challenge in the way of meeting that goal is that some
of those processes may share resources - files, say, or, perhaps, a whole
lot more.  Replicating that sharing at restore time is relatively easy; the
<tt>clone()</tt> system call provides a nice set of flags controlling the
sharing of resources.  The harder part is knowing, at checkpoint time,
whether that sharing is taking place.
<p>
One way for user space to determine whether, for example, two processes are
sharing the same open file would be to query the kernel for the address of
the associated <tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt> and see if they are the same in both
processes.  That kind of functionality sets off alarms among those concerned about
security, though; learning where data structures live in kernel space is
often an important precondition to an attack.  There was talk for a while
of "obfuscating" the pointers - through an exclusive-OR with a random
value, for example - but the risk was still seen as being too high.  So the
compromise is <tt>kcmp()</tt>, which simply answers the question of whether
resources found in two processes are the same or not.
<p>
<tt>kcmp()</tt> takes two process ID parameters, indicating the processes
of interest; both processes must be in the same PID namespace as the
calling process.  The <tt>type</tt> parameter tells the kernel the specific
item that is being compared:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>KCMP_FILE</tt>: determines whether a file descriptor <tt>idx1</tt>
     in the first process is the same as another descriptor (<tt>idx2</tt>)
     in the second process.
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_FILES</tt>: compares the file descriptor arrays to see
     whether the processes share all files.
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_FS</tt>: compares <tt>fs_struct</tt> structures (which hold
     the current umask, working directory, namespace root, etc.).
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_IO</tt>: compares the I/O context, used mainly for block I/O
     scheduling.
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_SIGHAND</tt>: compares the two process's signal handler
     arrays. 
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_SYSVSEM</tt>: compares the list of undo operations associated
     with SYSV semaphores.
<p>
<li> <tt>KCMP_VM</tt>: compares each process's address space.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
The return value from <tt>kcmp()</tt> is zero if the two items are equal,
one if the first item is "less" than the second, or two if the first is
"greater" than the second.  The ordered comparison may seem a little
strange, especially when one looks at the implementation and sees that the
pointers are obfuscated before comparison within the kernel.  The result
is, thus, an ordering that (by design) does not match the ordering of the
relevant data structures in kernel space.  It turns out that even a
reshuffled (but consistent) "ordering" is useful for optimizing comparisons
in user space when large numbers of open files are present.
<p>
This patch set has been through a few cycles of review and seems to have
addressed most of the concerns raised by reviewers.  It may just find its
way in through the next merge window.  Meanwhile, people who want to see
how the user-space side works can find the relevant code at <a
href="http://criu.org">criu.org</a>.
<p>
<h4>DMTCP</h4>
<p>
CRIU is not the only user-space checkpoint/restore implementation out
there; the <a href="http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/">DMTCP (Distributed
MultiThreaded CheckPointing)</a> project has been busy since about 2.6.9.
DMTCP differs somewhat from CRIU, though; in particular, it is able to
checkpoint groups of processes connected by sockets - even across different
machines - and it requires no changes to the kernel at all.  These features
come with a couple of limitations, though.
<p>
Checkpoint/restore with DMTCP requires that the target process(es) be
started with a special script; it is not possible to checkpoint arbitrary
processes on the system.  That script uses the LD_PRELOAD mechanism to
place wrappers around a number of libc and (especially) system call
implementations.  As a result, DMTCP has no need to ask the kernel whether
two processes are sharing a specific resource; it has been watching the
relevant system calls and knows how the processes were created.  The
disadvantage to this approach - beyond having to run checkpointable process
in a special environment - is that, as can be seen in <a
href="http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/supportedApps.html">the table of
supported applications</a>, not all programs can be checkpointed.
<p>
The recent <a href="http://sourceforge.net/news/?group_id=194616">1.2.4
release</a> improves support, though, to the point that 
everything a wide range of users care about should be checkpointable.  The
system has been integrated with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">Open
MPI</a> and is able to respond to MPI-generated checkpoint and restore
requests.  DMTCP is available with the openSUSE, Debian Testing, and Ubuntu
distributions.  DMTCP may offer something good enough today for many users,
who may not need to wait for one of the other projects to be ready sometime
in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks. I will cite it here for convenience. <br>
Description of the feature:<br>
"Checkpoint/restart allows the state of a set of processes to be saved to persistent storage, then restarted at some future time, possibly on a different system."<br>
Use cases:<br>
"It has a number of potential uses, including fault-tolerant systems, debugging (it's a sort of "super core dump"), fast application startup, testing, and as a kind of "generic time machine." That last one allows for the important use case of checkpointing a game, then restoring it after a move which proves to be a mistake. Checkpoint/restart can also be used as a sort of application-level suspend feature; it can function as a kind of "smart swap" which can move an application entirely out of memory when the need arises. There is also the interesting prospect of saving a desktop session on a USB key, then restarting it on an entirely different system in a different location."<br>

If memory serves all application in Android must be able to be stopped at any time (to preserve battery), so is-there a relationship with this and Android?<br>

No.<br>

In android, apps are expected to store state themselves so that when started again they will continue with that state.  <br>
<p>
As you can imagine, app implementation of this is spotty. <br>

Well, a robust checkpoint and restore feature could be used to implement the behavior Android desires without requiring special, spotty, support from the app.<br>

Full checkpoint/restore is much more resource consuming than having the application be able to serialise its important state and resynthesise the rest later. You probably wouldn't want to encourage the former at the expense of the latter.<br>

Being confused somewhat, what do HPC people use when they checkpoint/restart? I've been told many times that HPC applications do checkpoint/restart very often. But how?<br>

The HPC applications periodically store their state so that they can kill the app, move the state file to another machine, and start the app again (picking up where it left off)<br>
<p>
Doing this inside an app is fairly easy as long as there is no problem re-doing work since the last checkpoint, or you can send the app a signal "stop working and save a checkpoint now"<br>
<p>
doing this at the OS level so that you can do this with arbitrary apps, without the app (or other systems the app is communicating with) even knowing that it has taken place is very hard. It's this problem that you are seeing worked on.<br>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>December 2, 2009</br>

<p>
When last we <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325180/">looked</a> in on
utrace, back in March, it was being proposed for inclusion into 2.6.30.
There were various objections at that time, but the biggest was the lack of
a "real" in-kernel user for utrace.  It was suggested that providing a real
user along with utrace itself would smooth its path into the mainline.
Now utrace has <a href="/Articles/364705/">returned</a> in the form of a
set of patches from Oleg Nesterov (based on Roland McGrath's work), along
with a 
rewrite of the <tt>ptrace()</tt> 
system call using the utrace interface.  With the 2.6.33 merge window
opening soon, the hope is that utrace will, finally, make its way into the
mainline. </p>

<p>
Utrace provides a means to control user-space threads, which could be
used for debugging, tracing, and other tasks like user-mode-linux.
SystemTap is one of the biggest current utrace users, as Red Hat and Fedora
kernels have had utrace support for several years.  Utrace came
from a recognition that <tt>ptrace()</tt> was too limited&mdash;and
messy&mdash;for many of the things folks wanted to use it for.  In
particular, only allowing one active tracing process for a given thread, as
<tt>ptrace()</tt> requires, was too limiting for various envisioned tracing
and control scenarios.  Utrace allows multiple tracing "engines" to attach
to a thread, list which events they are interested in, and receive
callbacks when those events occur.
</p>

<p>
The interface provided by utrace has not changed enormously since our first
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224772/">look</a> in March 2007.  Engines,
which are typically implemented as loadable kernel modules, will attach to
a given 
thread by using <tt>utrace_attach_task()</tt> or
<tt>utrace_attach_pid()</tt> depending on whether they have a <tt>struct
task_struct</tt> or <tt>struct pid</tt> available.  In either case, a
<tt>struct utrace_engine</tt> pointer is returned, which is used to
identify the engine in additional calls.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>struct utrace_engine</tt> looks like:
<pre>
    struct utrace_engine {
        const struct utrace_engine_ops *ops;
        void *data;
        unsigned long flags;
    }; 
</pre>
with <tt>flags</tt> containing an event mask and <tt>data</tt> used for
engine-specific private data.  The most interesting part is the
<tt>ops</tt> field which points to a set of ten different callback
functions.  These functions make up the heart of the tracing engine
functionality.  
</p>

<p>
The function pointers in <tt>struct utrace_engine_ops</tt> are <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/roland/utrace/DocBook/re10.html">described</a>
in <tt>linux/utrace.h</tt>.  All of the kerneldoc comments are pulled from
the source code files into the
<a
href="http://people.redhat.com/roland/utrace/DocBook/">DocBook
documentation</a> that comes with the patchset.  The callbacks are made as
the traced thread encounters various events.  These include signals being
delivered, <tt>clone()</tt> or <tt>exec()</tt> being called, other system
calls as they are entered or exited, thread exit or death, and more.  In
each case, the callbacks are made for each interested engine in the order
in which the engines were attached.
</p>

<p>
An engine uses the <tt>utrace_set_events()</tt> (or
<tt>utrace_set_events_pid()</tt>) call to indicate which of the events it
is interested in:
<pre>
    int utrace_set_events(struct task_struct *target,
                          struct utrace_engine *engine,
                          unsigned long events);
</pre>
The <tt>UTRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro is used to turn on the appropriate bits
in the <tt>events</tt> mask.  There must be a callback defined in the
<tt>engine->ops</tt> table for any events which are enabled.
</p>

<p>
Once a callback has been invoked, the engine uses <tt>utrace_control()</tt>
(or <tt>utrace_control_pid()</tt>) to tell the traced thread to do
something:
<pre>
    int utrace_control(struct task_struct *target,
                       struct utrace_engine *engine,
                       enum utrace_resume_action action);
</pre>
The <tt>action</tt> parameter governs what is supposed to happen.  Those
actions include things like single-stepping, block-stepping, resuming
execution, detaching from the thread, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In the only real complaint about the patchset seen so far, Christoph
Hellwig is <a href="/Articles/364769/">unhappy</a> that the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> reimplementation is not supplanting the
current <tt>ptrace()</tt> code: "<q>One thing I really hate about this
is that it introduces two ptrace implementations by adding the new one
without removing the old one.</q>"  In the patches, the inclusion of
utrace is governed by the <tt>CONFIG_UTRACE</tt> flag.  Since it isn't
optional to have a <tt>ptrace()</tt> system call, that meant the current
code needed to stay.
</p>

<p>
What Hellwig suggests, though, is adding utrace support to the two major
architectures that don't have it (arm and mips), then removing the current
<tt>ptrace()</tt>.  He clearly believes it is too late to get utrace into
2.6.33, which would allow time to get utrace support into those&mdash;and
hopefully 
other, minor architectures&mdash;before utrace is merged.  "<q>If the
remaining minor architectures don't manage to get their homework done
they're left without ptrace,</q>" he said.
</p>

<p> That didn't sit well with various other kernel hackers.  Pavel Machek
<a href="/Articles/364772/">said</a>: "<q>I don't think introducing
regressions to force people to rewrite code is a good way to go</q>".
In addition, Ingo Molnar seems to have warmed up to utrace's inclusion
since it was last proposed.  Molnar had many complaints
about utrace last time, but is much more positive this time.  He doesn't <a
href="/Articles/364774/">think</a> adding more architecture support is the
way to go:
<div class="BigQuote">
Regarding porting it to even more architectures - that's pretty much the 
worst idea possible. It increases maintenance and testing overhead by 
exploding the test matrix, while giving little to [the] end result. Plus the 
worst effect of it is that it becomes even more intrusive and even 
harder (and riskier) to merge.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Unlike last time, where most of the complaints were not aimed at the code
itself, but more at its timing and lack of an in-kernel user, this time
there is some code review taking place.  Peter Zijlstra has a fairly
detailed <a href="/Articles/364779/">review</a> of both the code and
documentation for example.  There is a clear sense that utrace is clearing
hurdles that may have held it up in the past.
</p>

<p>
One of the outcomes from the tracing meetings at the Collaboration Summit
in April was to come up with an in-kernel user, and <tt>ptrace()</tt>
seemed like a good candidate.  Other ideas were mentioned in those
meetings, including adding a gdb "stub" in the kernel to allow
debugging of user-space programs.  A <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/364268/">patch</a> to expose a
<tt>/proc/PID/gdb</tt> interface that implements gdb's remote serial
protocol was proposed by Srikar Dronamraju.  
</p>

<p>
That patch is running into more serious difficulty than utrace seems to
be.  Because <tt>kgdb</tt> already exposes the remote serial interface for
gdb, but for the kernel instead, Zijlstra and Molnar think that the two
should be combined.  It seems unlikely to get merged until that is resolved.
</p>

<p>
Some parts of the utrace patchset have spent time in the -mm tree, and
utrace has been shipped with every Fedora kernel since FC6.  But the
utrace-ptrace piece has not done any time in either -mm or -next, which may
make it harder to get it in the mainline for 2.6.33.  Since utrace is
optional, though, there are relatively few risks.  McGrath is willing to
<a href="/Articles/364782/">consider</a> removing the current
<tt>ptrace()</tt> implementation, but its clear that he and
Nesterov&mdash;maintainers of the current <tt>ptrace()</tt>&mdash;would
prefer to get utrace into the mainline now:
<div class="BigQuote">
We don't want to rush anyone, like uninterested arch maintainers.  We don't
want to break anyone who doesn't care about our work (we do test for ptrace
regressions but of course new code will always have new bugs so some
instances of instability in the transition to a new ptrace implementation
have to be expected no matter how hard we try).  We just don't want to keep
working out of tree.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Presumably, we will know within the next few weeks whether utrace makes its
way into 2.6.33.  But, if that doesn't happen, it would
seem that one more kernel development cycle is all that it should take.

      This article underlines the statement in the previous article ("<I>In his travels, your editor has heard complaints from developers who set out to accomplish a specific task, only to be told that they must undertake a much larger cleanup to get their code merged</I>") with a number of examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It was suggested that providing a real user along with utrace...
<LI>utrace has returned [...] with a rewrite of the ptrace() [...] [should] add utrace support to the two major architectures that don't have it
<LI>A patch to expose a /proc/PID/gdb interface [...] is running into more serious difficulty [...] should be combined [with kgdb]
</UL>
<P>
This is clearly a development process issue. At our project most of the developers work on adding new features (after all, this is what the customer wants), but some time is set aside to do maintenance and clean-up tasks to keep the code in a healthy state. Maybe the kernel developers could try something like this. This is a lot more than janitorial work, because it might need deep understanding of the affected areas and probably shouldn't be done by the odd developer who scratched his itch to implement some feature.

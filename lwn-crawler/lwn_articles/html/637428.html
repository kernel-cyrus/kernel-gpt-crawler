<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">LSFMM 2015</a>
</div>
<p>
Dmitry Monakhov prefaced his 2015 LSFMM Summit session on filesystem
defragmentation with a statement that the "problem is almost already
solved". His session turned into a largely informational description of the
status of a defragmentation tool that he has been working on.
</p>

<p>
 Over time, filesystems change and cannot avoid fragmentation
issues, he said.  For example, extracting a Linux source tree results in many
 small files that filesystem tries to allocate close to each other.
 Building in the tree results in lots of temporary files that get removed, so
 the filesystem gets fragmented.
</p>

<p>
Beyond appearing in regular filesystems, these fragmentation problems show
up in thin provisioning systems, as well 
as for shingled magnetic recording (SMR) devices, he said.  In addition, to
make boot times shorter, it would be best to lay out all the needed files
sequentially on the disk, which may require defragmentation.
</p>

<p>
The fragmentation problem is already solved for large files.  Btrfs, XFS,
and ext4 all 
have tools for doing defragmentation on files.  But there is no solution
for directory fragmentation.  The filesystems try to put files that are in
the same directory close to each other on the disk, but as files get
deleted or moved, fragmentation of the directory occurs.
</p>

<p>
To perform defragmentation, it is often necessary to copy file data from
one place to another.  Monakhov suggested that a checksum could be
calculated on the data when doing that copy, which could then be stored in
a "trusted" extended attribute (xattr). He noted that overlayfs uses the
"trusted.overlay" xattr, which can only be modified by processes with
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>, so a 
"trusted.sha1" (or or other hash) could be calculated and stored when
copying data for defragmentation.

<p>
Executable files could then have their
contents checked and compared to the hash value before being executed.  He
proposed adding that capability 
to his tool, but it seemed to be something of an aside.  It is not clear
how it relates to the <a href="/Articles/488906/">integrity measurement
architecture (IMA)</a>, for example. 
</p>

<p>
He has been working on a tool called <tt>e4defrag2</tt> (developed in a <a
href="https://github.com/dmonakhov/e2fsprogs/tree/e4defrag2">branch of
e2fsprogs</a>) that will perform defragmentation.  It is mostly independent
of the filesystem type.  It uses the same block scanning code to find
fragmentation, but ext4 and XFS have a different <tt>ioctl()</tt> name for
their defragmentation operations.
</p>

<p>
The result is a "giant utility that works for everything", Monakhov said.
The filesystem-dependent part is roughly 100 lines of code.  This
"universal defragmenter" will be released soon.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o asked what would be needed to eliminate the 100 lines.  He asked
if wiring up the XFS <tt>ioctl()</tt> name into ext4 would help.  Monakhov
said that the tool needs to get the block bitmap from the filesystem, which
is also different between the filesystems.  Ts'o and Dave Chinner indicated
that they would attempt 
to provide the same interfaces. Chinner did caution that XFS cannot
defragment a range in a file, only the whole file.  That is different than
ext4, Monakhov said.

      <p>Forgive me for being a little unenlightened, but didn't I read somewhere a number of years ago that Linux filesystems (e.g. Ext2/3/4)<sup>1</sup> are resistant to fragmentation (or at least the ill effects thereof) by design?</p>

<p>Not that I'm trying to dismiss Dmitry's work.  I suppose SMR devices expose new engineering challenges with respect to filesystem layout.</p>

<p>Also, just an idea:  If Dmitry's utility is as filesystem-agnostic as mentioned, why not drop the &quot;<tt>e4</tt>&quot; from the tool's name.  Or, how about a more universal-sounding &quot;<tt>fsdefrag2</tt>&quot;?  (Again, just a suggestion&mdash;I'm pleased that someone is working on keeping our filesystems neat-and-orderly.) :-)</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Also ReiserFS, JFS, XFS, etc.</p>

Linux filesystems *are* resistant to fragmentation, in the sense that the allocation algorithms make an effort to find contiguous spans to write new data to, while avoiding packing files like sardines in case some of them need to be appended to.<br>
<p>
There's still good reasons for defragmentation, the main one being the above scheme tends to fragment free space over time, making it increasingly difficult to find large contiguous areas on a disk that's filling up. There's also the use case of boot and possibly individual applications, where you can measure an access pattern once and optimize heavily for it - `e4rat` does that, but the name implies it's ext4-only.<br>
<p>
The official builds of Firefox have been doing a similar thing for a few years now, by packing all the data needed for startup into a large, carefully crafted .so file that causes it to be read more or less linearly. If some of that behaviour can be done in the filesystem, everyone wins.<br>

I think this myth is so prevalent all over the internet, that people now just assume it is true.  Try downloading the android source tree using repo -j 24 and I suspect you will notice a 10-20% degradation in copying that tree, right of the bat, with respect to a tree that was synced with a -j 1.  Even a -j 8 suffers noticeably I think. Add in builds mixed with resyncs (from yan upstream which gets lots of regular little changes) and the directory tree will eventually become unusable (with ext4 at least).  It is great that people are starting to recognize some fragmentation issues.  I hope that work can also be done on the FSes themselves to improve this so that a separate defragmentation tool is not needed.<br>

<p>
Well to be honest there is *some* truth to this "myth", but fragmentation resistance is not a binary thing, but a matter of degree, and while Linux is a whole lot better than Windows, it is not (and can not possibly be) perfect.<br>
<p>
It's a bit like the FAT vs NTFS story back in the NT4 days.  NTFS was so much better than FAT that MS thought a defragmentation tool in NT4 was unnecessary. However, after several months of typical use (or several days of a pathologically bad use pattern) the performance penalty still grew significant, and MS had to back-pedal.<br>
<p>
Now the Linux file systems are even better than NTFS, but the story is essentially the same, except knowledgeable Linux people have generally not claimed defragmentation tools to be completely unnecessary, only not a priority (until now, apparently).<br>

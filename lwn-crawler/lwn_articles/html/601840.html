<h1>The unified control group hierarchy in 3.16</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 11, 2014</br>
           </div>
The idea of reworking the kernel's control group implementation is not
exactly new; see <a href="/Articles/484251/">this article from early
2012</a>, for example.  However, that talk has not yet translated into much
in the way of user-visible changes to the kernel.  That situation will
change in the 3.16 release, which will include the new unified control
group hierarchy code.  This article will be an overview of how the
unified hierarchy will work at the user level.

<p>
At its core, the control group subsystem is simply a way of organizing
processes into hierarchies; controllers can then be applied to the
hierarchies to enforce policies on the processes contained therein.  From
the beginning, control groups have allowed the creation of multiple
hierarchies, each of which can contain a different mix of processes.  So
one could, for example, create one hierarchy and attach the CPU scheduler
controller to it.  Another hierarchy could be created for the memory
controller; it could contain the same processes, but with a different
organization.  That would allow memory usage policy to be applied to
different groupings of the same processes.
<p>
This flexibility has a certain appeal, but it has its costs.  It can be
expensive for the kernel to keep track of all the controllers that apply to a
given process.  Controllers also cannot effectively cooperate with each
other, since they may be operating on entirely different hierarchies.  In
some cases (memory and block I/O bandwidth control, for example), better
cooperation is needed to effectively control resource use.  And, in the
end, there has been little real-world use of this feature.  So the plan has
long been to get rid of the multiple-hierarchy feature, though it has
always been known that this change would take a long time to effect fully.
<p>
Work on the unified control group hierarchy has been underway for some
time, with much of the preparatory work being merged into the 3.14 and 3.15
kernels.  In 3.16, this feature will be available, but only to users who
ask for it explicitly.  To use the unified hierarchy, the new control group
virtual filesystem should be mounted with a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    mount -t cgroup -o __DEVEL__sane_behavior cgroup &lt;mount-point&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, the <tt>__DEVEL__sane_behavior</tt> option is not intended to be
a permanent fixture.  It may still be some time, though, before the unified
hierarchy becomes available as a default feature.

</blockquote>
<p>
It is worth noting that the older, multiple-hierarchy mode continues to
work even if the unified hierarchy mode is used; it will be kept around for
as long as it seems to be needed.  The 
unified hierarchy can be instantiated alongside older hierarchies, but
controllers cannot be shared between the unified hierarchy and any others.
The care that has been taken in this area should allow users to experiment
with the unified mode while avoiding changes that would break existing
systems.
<p>
In current kernels, controllers are attached to control groups by
specifying options to the <tt>mount</tt> command that creates the
hierarchy.  In the unified hierarchy world, instead, all controllers are

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cgroup-unified.png" width=222 height=152
alt="[Control group hierarchy]" hspace=3 vspace=3 border=0 align="right">

attached to the root of the hierarchy.  
(Strictly speaking that's not quite true; controllers attached to old-style
hierarchies will not be available in the unified hierarchy, but that's a
detail that can be ignored for now).
Controllers can be enabled for specific
subtrees of the hierarchy, subject to a small set of rules.  For the
purposes of illustrating these rules, imagine a control group hierarchy
like the one shown on the right; groups A and B live directly under the root
control group, while C and D are children of B.
<p>
Each control group in the hierarchy has (in its associated control
directory) a file called <tt>cgroup.controllers</tt> that lists the
controllers that can be enabled for children of that group.  Another file,
<tt>cgroup.subtree_control</tt>, lists the controllers that are actually
enabled; writing to that file can turn controllers on or off.  It is worth
repeating that these files manage the controllers attached to the
<i>children</i> of the group; in the unified hierarchy, a control group is
thought of as delegating its resources to subgroups for management.  There
are some interesting implications resulting from this design.
<p>
One of those is that a control group must apply a controller to all of its
children or none.  If the memory controller is enabled in B's
<tt>cgroup.subtree_control</tt> file, it will apply to both C and D; there
is no way (from B's point of view) to apply the controller to only one of
those subgroups.  Further, 
a controller can only be enabled in a specific control group if it is
enabled in that group's parent; a controller cannot be enabled in
group C unless it is already enabled in group B.  That suggests that all
controllers that are actually meant to be used must be enabled in the root
control group, at which point they will apply to the entire hierarchy.  It
<i>is</i>, however, possible to disable a controller at a lower level.  So,
if the CPU controller is enabled in the root, it can be disabled in
group&nbsp;A, exempting all of A's descendant groups from CPU control.
<p>
Another new rule is that the <tt>cgroup.subtree_control</tt> file can only
be used to change the set of active controllers if the associated group
contains no processes.  So, for example, if group&nbsp;B has controllers
enabled in its <tt>cgroup.subtree_control</tt> file, it cannot contain any
processes; those processes must all be placed into group&nbsp;C or&nbsp;D.
This rule prevents situations where processes in the parent control group
are competing with those in the child groups — situations that current
controllers handle inconsistently and, often, badly.
The one exception to the "no processes" rule is the root control group.
<p>
One other control file found in the unified hierarchy is called
<tt>cgroup.populated</tt>; reading it will return a nonzero value if there
are any processes in the group (or its descendants).  By using
<tt>poll()</tt> on this file, a process can be notified if a control group
becomes completely empty; the process would presumably respond by cleaning
up and removing the group.  Current kernels, instead, create a helper
process to provide the notification; this technique has been frowned on for
years. 
<p>
The unified hierarchy will allow a privileged process to delegate access to
control group functionality by changing the owner of the associated control
files.  But this delegation only works to an extent: a unprivileged process
with access to the control files can create child control groups and move
processes between groups, but it cannot change any controller settings.
This policy is there partly to keep unprivileged processes from disrupting
the system, but the intent is also to restrict access to the more advanced
control knobs.  These knobs are currently deemed to expose too much
information about the kernel's internals, so there is a desire to avoid
having applications depend on them.
<p>
All of this work has been extensively discussed for years, with most of the
major users of control groups having had their say.  So it should be suitable
for most of the known uses today, but that is no substitute for actually
seeing things work.  The 3.16 kernel will provide an opportunity
for interested users to try out the new mode and find out which problems
remain; actual migration by users to the new scheme cannot be expected to
happen for a few more development cycles at the earliest, though.  But, at
some point, the control 
group rework will cease being something that's mostly talked about and
become just another big job that eventually got done.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Well, cgroups unified hierarchy is getting better. It looks like it's going to be possible to delegate a subtree to a container by bind-mounting it and making sure that the container's cgroups controller has adequate capabilities.<br>
<p>
I can live with that, it's certainly better than The One Daemon To Rule Them All approach that systemd loves and wants.<br>
<p>
Now, ability to grant permissions to move processes between cgroups to unprivileged users is baffling. It's not really of much use at all, without corresponding ability to change knobs. I understand that developers are hesitant to allow manipulation of some settings, but perhaps they can divide settings into 'good' and 'bad' sets and allowing unrestricted access only to the 'good' set?<br>

This seems to have been the plan from when the start when a unified hierarchy was announced, that they would take away delegation and then add it back piece by piece as the security implications were better understood and the implementation refactored.  I think this is evidence that all the people who thought the kernel cgroups maintainers were conspiring with the systemd maintainers to pee in everyones favorite breakfast cereal may have been mistaken.<br>

There were plans to make cgroups tree modifiable only by a _single_ process. As far as I remember, there were plans to add a special 'pid' file to write the pid of the authorized process. <br>
<p>
And systemd was all for it. See here as an example: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/555922/">https://lwn.net/Articles/555922/</a><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;This hierarchy becomes private property of systemd. systemd will set</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;it up. Systemd will maintain it. Systemd will rearrange it. Other</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;software that wants to make use of cgroups can do so only through</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;systemd's APIs. This single-writer logic is absolutely necessary</font><br>
<p>
There were similar (in spirit) messages from Tejun Heo.<br>
<p>
So I guess somebody hit the cgroups developers hard enough to make them see the light and re-introduce a sane delegation mechanism.<br>

What is the rationale for cgroups having their own mount in the first place?   Assuredly cgroups are part of UAPI to the kernel, and as such they'd make more sense in /proc than /sys.    With just one hierarchy, having cgroups in /proc would be more consistent with what's already there.<br>

Originally procfs was about managing processes.<br>
But you know .. Linux is now mature OS so it cannot change suddenly UAPI (despite that in Documentation directory still you can find document listing why Linux does not need stable KAPI/UAPI).<br>
Linux has some kind of schizophrenia. In procfs you can find even some old attempts to try maintain not only processes and threads but groups of processes as well like /proc/&lt;PID&gt;/task/* but who cares that current attempt to catch up something which is working more than decade in other OSes is breaking something existing.<br>
Cgroups development started at 2007. Who cares that after 7 years still is useless on providing very basic functionalities?<br>
Let's give the chance new kernel developers generation to contribute to growing Linux kernel entropy .. isn't it?<br>

Um, /proc/$pid/task *is* how procfs provides information on threads. It's not 'groups of processes', it's groups of *kernel tasks*, i.e. schedulable entities: what POSIX calls threads. There is nothing in procfs to track groups of processes in any other sense (you can't even follow the pid -&gt; ppid hierarchy via the directory hierarchy or via symlinks, you have to parse /proc/$pid/status).<br>

While I understand that having lots of independent control groups makes it difficult, especially if controllers need to cooperate, I don't see why the conclusion needs to be only a single group. Less groups, yes, but only one?<br>
<p>
For example, having a hierarchy for the processes like systemd wants and a hierarchy for resources seems like it could work. And would satisfy more people I believe.<br>

There are perhaps two systemd cgroups controllers that should be separate: cpuacct and freezer. <br>
<p>
Cpuacct is harmless - it's a read-only accounting tool and can be used without too much consideration for its overhead or cross-controller interactions.<br>
<p>
Freezer is different - it's often necessary to stop multiple processes atomically and they very well might be on separate levels.<br>

What I'd quite like to see is a clone/unshare flag which would put the child/process into it's own cgroup  as a sub-cgroup of the cgroup it was originally in. This could be an unprivileged operation even if moving processes between cgroups requires privileges. <br>
<p>
This would be useful for things like make where you might want to by default avoid slowing  your other applications when you pass -j20.<br>
<p>
I would find it most useful for unit test runners where you want to be certain that you've killed all the processes that were started by the test when the test ends.  Essentially it would be process groups that actually work. <br>

Anyone knows how long it may take?<br>
Why Linux still is suffering on NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome?<br>
Why something so simple like managing tasks and processes must be driven by yet-another-stupid-fs?<br>
Why no one from Linux developers is able to sit down study existing implementation of solutions of some problems, after this develop on first step consistent base API with plan how to extend base functionalities, and after this stick to agreed/approved plan?<br>
Why .. ?<br>
Why .. ?<br>
.<br>

<p>
Ten years after developing DTrace on Solaris most of the time spend on SystemTap, LTT, LTTng and many other attempts can be put in garbage and now more people on Linux is using DTrace delivered by commercial company.<br>
<p>
Why Linux developers are trying again and again repeating the same errors and expecting that at some point it will Work(tm)?<br>

you seem to be trolling, but I will answer one thing<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Ten years after developing DTrace on Solaris</font><br>
<p>
Sun licensed DTrace in a way that is deliberately incompatible with the GPLv2 license of the Linux kernel. As a result, it can't legally be distributed for Linux.<br>
<p>
So blame this one on Sun/Oracle not Linux developers.<br>

Well, I'd be very interested to hear where you got this information from. I'm one of the DTrace for Linux developers, and, y'know, I don't have that information. Possibly my bosses have it, but if so they haven't told me. To be honest I have no idea how anyone could know this sort of thing without horrendously invasive spying on users, or wildly unreliable usage surveys which have as far as know not been conducted.
<p>
(But maybe you mean some <i>other</i> Linux DTrace developed by a commercial company? Or perhaps you mean not 'more people than use SystemTap / perf / something else' but rather 'more people than used to use it', which is trivially true if it is used by anyone at all, since it has not always existed.)

           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2014/">2014 LSFMM Summit</a>
</div>
<p>
Matthew Wilcox and Kent Overstreet talked about support for persistent
memory in the kernel on the first day of the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory Management Summit held in Napa, California.  There have been, well,
persistent rumors of the imminent availability of persistent memory for
some time, but Wilcox said you can actually buy some devices now.  He
wanted to 
report on some progress he had made on supporting these devices as well as
to ask the assembled developers for their thoughts on some unresolved issues.
</p>

<p>
Persistent memory is supposed to be as fast as DRAM, but to retain its
contents even without power.  To support these devices, Wilcox has written a <a
href="/Articles/591646/">"direct access" block layer that
is called DAX</a> ("it has an 'X', which is cool", he saidâ€”it also is a
three-letter acronym that is not used by anything else in the kernel).  The idea
behind DAX came from the execute-in-place (XIP) code in the kernel, not
because the data accessed from persistent memory will be executed,
necessarily, but
because it should avoid the page cache.  XIP originally came from IBM, which wanted to
share executables and libraries between virtual machines, but it has also
been used in the embedded world to execute directly from ROM or flash.
</p>

<p>
Since persistent memory is as fast as RAM, it doesn't make sense to put
another copy into memory as a page cache entry.  XIP seemed like a logical
starting point, since it avoided the page cache, but it required a lot of
work to make it suitable for persistent memory. So Wilcox rewrote it and
renamed it.  Filesystems will make calls to the 
<tt>direct_access()</tt> block device operation in a DAX driver to access
data from the device 
without it ending up in the page cache.  Wilcox would like to see DAX
merged, so he was encouraging people in the room to look at the code and comment.
</p>

<p>
But there are a few problem areas still.
Currently, calling <tt>msync()</tt> to flush a range of memory to
persistent storage will actually sync the
entire file and metadata.  That is not required by POSIX and Wilcox would
like to change the behavior to just sync the range in question.  Obviously
that has  a much further reach than just affecting DAX, and Peter
Zijlstra cautioned that changing sync behavior can surprise user space,
pointing to "<tt>fsync()</tt> wars from a few years back" as an example.
User space often doesn't care what is supposed to be done, instead it
depends on the existing semantics, he said.
</p>

<p>
Wilcox said that kernel developers "suck at implementing [syncing], user
space sucks at using it" and concluded that "syncing sucks".  The consensus
seemed to be that any application that was syncing a range, but depending
on the whole file being synced, is broken.  Furthermore, Chris Mason was
all in favor of fixing <tt>msync()</tt> for ranges as it would "make
filesystem guys look good". 
</p>

<p>
Another problem area is with the <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> flag for
<tt>mmap()</tt>.  It has two meanings, one of which is not very well known,
he said.  <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> means to map the pages at the address specified, which is
expected.  But it also means to unmap any pages that are in the way of that
mapping, which is surprising.  Someone must have wanted that behavior at
one time, but no one wants it any more, he said.  He has proposed a
<tt>MAP_WEAK</tt> flag that would only map the memory if nothing else is
occupying the address range.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> function cannot be used with persistent memory, because
there are no <tt>struct page</tt> entries created for it.  There could be a
lot of pages in a persistent memory device, so wasting 64 bytes per page for a mostly
unused <tt>struct page</tt> is not desirable.  The call to
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> is generally for I/O, so Dave Hansen has been
working on a <tt>get_user_sg()</tt> that create a scatter-gather list
for doing I/O.  The crypto subsystem also wants this capability, Wilcox said.
</p>

<p>
There is a problem, though.  A <tt>truncate()</tt> operation could remove
blocks out from under <tt>get_user_sg()</tt>, which would leave a mess
behind.  Wilcox wondered if file truncation could just be blocked until the
pages are no longer pinned by the I/O operation.  That did not seem
popular, but Overstreet had another idea.
</p>

<p>
Overstreet has been working on a direct I/O rewrite for some time and, in
many ways, doing a DAX mapping and a direct I/O look similar, he said.  His
rewrite would create a new <tt>struct bio</tt> that would be the container
for the I/O.  It would get rid of the <tt>get_block()</tt> callback, which
is, he said, a horrible interface. For one thing, it may have to read the
mapping from disk, which should be asynchronous, but <tt>get_block()</tt> isn't.
Moving to <tt>struct bio</tt> would allow the usual block-layer filesystem
locking to avoid the <tt>truncate()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There were some complaints that making I/O be <tt>bio</tt>-based was
problematic for filesystems like NFS and CIFS that don't use the
<tt>bio</tt> structure.  Overstreet said that we may get to a point where buffered
I/O lives atop direct I/O, which would help that problem.  In addition,
Mason did not think that a <tt>bio</tt>-based interface would really be
that big of a problem for NFS and others.  A <tt>bio</tt> is just a
container of pages, Overstreet said.
</p>

<p>
In the end, no really clear conclusions were drawn.  It would seem that
folks need to review the DAX code (and, eventually, Overstreet's direct I/O
rewrite) before reaching those conclusions.

I actually use the silly MAP_FIXED behavior.  I allocate chunks of memory with guard pages, and I do it by allocating a bit PROT_NONE, MAP_NORESERVE region, and then allocating real memory in the middle of it with MAP_FIXED.<br>

What do you need the guard regions for?<br>
<p>
I understand how a guard region can be useful for detecting when a stack needs to be extended, but I've often seen other PROT_NONE mappings (like the one created by the dynamic linker for every shared library that's mapped in) and I don't really know why they're used.<br>

Isn't the same effect achieved by not allocating that page/region at all? Why is it better to allocate it as PROT_NONE?<br>
<p>
I guess maybe if you didn't explicitly allocate surrounding guard regions, your next mmap could be placed adjacent to your previous one (if you don't explicitly specify MAP_FIXED)? Does the kernel actually do this in practice?<br>

The kernel seems to stick them all right next to each other if I don't explicitly add a PROT_NONE region in the way.  And, since MAP_FIXED overwrites things, I can't just guess a desired address and try it with MAP_FIXED, since I'll crash if I guess badly.<br>
<p>
The upshot is that the an improved MAP_FIXED flag would actually improve my use case a bit.<br>

Maybe we should have MAP_WANT_GUARD_PAGES, too.<br>

get_user_sg has my vote - for 3.16 we have patches floating for drm/i915 to map userspace ranges into the gpu address space, and atm we use get_user_pages + create an sg table from it. But within the driver we exclusively deal with sg lists since we already support non struct page backed memoery (gfx stolen range reserved by the firmware), so having a get_user_sg would neatly clean up our code.<br>

A new flag is almost unnecessary. The current behavior is that if you pass an address without MAP_FIXED, it will map your space there, if and only if that address is available. If the address is not available, it will map it somewhere else.<br>
<p>
So, the workaround is trivial: you call mmap with an address, without MAP_FIXED, and then compare the address returned to the address requested. If they don't match, unmap and return a failure.<br>

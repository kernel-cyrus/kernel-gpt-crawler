<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>April 3, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> Dave Jones continues to exercise his <a
href="/Articles/536173/">Trinity fuzz tester</a> and uncover interesting
bugs in kernel code. One recent find was a long-standing bug in
the implementation of network namespaces. 

<p> The discussion of the bug began when
Dave <a href="/Articles/545421/">posted</a> a note to the linux-kernel
mailing list with stack traces that showed a kernel deadlock in the VFS
code. Dave's report prompted Al Viro
to <a href="/Articles/545456/">wonder</a> how a Trinity instance was
managing to sit blocked on <i>two</i> locks (a situation that should never
be able to happen), as shown in the
<a href="/Articles/185666/">lockdep</a> output posted by Dave (the output
has some key pieces highlighted):

<pre>
    Showing all locks held in the system:
    4 locks on stack by trinity-child2/7669:
     #0: <b>blocked</b>:  (sb_writers#4){.+.+.+}, 
         instance: ffff8801292d17d8, at: [&lt;ffffffff811df134&gt;] mnt_want_write+0x24/0x50
     #1: held:     (&amp;type-&gt;s_vfs_rename_key){+.+.+.}, 
         instance: ffff8801292d1928, at: [&lt;ffffffff811c6f5e&gt;] lock_rename+0x3e/0x120
     #2: held:     (&amp;type-&gt;<b>i_mutex_dir_key</b>#2/1){+.+.+.}, 
         instance: <b>ffff880110b3a858</b>, at: [&lt;ffffffff811c701e&gt;] lock_rename+0xfe/0x120
     #3: <b>blocked</b>:  (&amp;type-&gt;<b>i_mutex_dir_key</b>#2/2){+.+.+.}, 
         instance: <b>ffff880110b3a858</b>, at: [&lt;ffffffff811c7034&gt;] lock_rename+0x114/0x120
</pre>

<p> Al also <a href="/Articles/545457/">noted</a> that the output suggested
that a directory inode in the inode cache was mapped by two different
dentries, since lockdep showed two <tt>i_mutex_dir_key</tt> locks on the
same address. A dentry (directory entry) is a data structure representing a
filename in the kernel directory entry cache (dcache); a brief overview of
dentries and the dcache can be found in <a href="/Articles/419811/">this
article</a>. As will become clear shortly, it should normally never happen
that a directory inode is mapped twice in the dcache.

<p> Some suggestions ensued regarding suitable debugging statements to add
to the kernel's <tt>lock_rename()</tt> function to further investigate the
problem.  In particular, when two locks were held on the same inode
address, Linus <a href="/Articles/545458/">wanted to see</a> the filenames
corresponding to the inode and Al <a href="/Articles/545461/">was
interested to know</a> the name of the filesystem holding the two inodes.

<p> Further runs of Trinity with those debugging statements in place <a
href="/Articles/545462/">revealed</a> that the locks in question were occurring
for various entries under the <tt>/proc</tt> tree. At that point Linus <a
href="/Articles/545464/">refined</a> the observation to note that the entries in
question were for directories under <tt>/proc/net</tt>, but, like Al, he was
puzzled as to how that could occur. 

<p> Here, a little background is probably in order.  Once upon a time,
<tt>/proc/net</tt> was single directory. But, with the invention of network
namespaces, it is now a symbolic link to the <tt>/proc/self/net</tt>
directory; in other words, each process now has its own
network-namespace-specific view of networking information under
<tt>/proc</tt>.

<p> With the output from the kernel debugging statements, the pieces
started falling rapidly into place. Dave <a
href="/Articles/545465/">realized</a> that he had started seeing the
Trinity failure reports after he had enabled kernel namespaces support
following a recent bug fix by Eric Biederman. Al began <a
href="/Articles/545466/">looking more closely</a> at some of the
subdirectories under the <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt> directories, and
made an unhappy discovery:

<pre>
    al &lt;at&gt; duke:~/linux/trees/vfs$ <b>ls -lid /proc/{1,2}/net/stat</b>
    4026531842 dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Mar 21 19:33 /proc/1/net/stat
    4026531842 dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Mar 21 19:33 /proc/2/net/stat
</pre>

<p>
That discovery prompted a small explosion:

<div class="BigQuote">

    <p>
    WE CAN
    NOT HAVE SEVERAL DENTRIES OVER THE SAME DIRECTORY INODE. [&hellip;]
    Sigh...  Namespace kinds - there should've been only one...

</div>

<p> Those with a long memory, or at least careful attention when reading <a
href="/Articles/531114/">a recent LWN article</a>, might smile with the
realization that, to begin with and for many years thereafter, there was
only one class of namespace&mdash;mount namespaces, as implemented by one
Al Viro.

<p> Humor aside, Al had discovered the origin of the problem.  The
directory listing above shows two directory entries linked to the same
inode. More generally, for all of the processes that share a network
namespace, each of the corresponding entries in
<tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt> is implemented as a hard link to the same
(virtual) <tt>/proc</tt> file.

<p> Implementing corresponding <tt>/proc</tt> entries as hard links to the
same inode is a technique used in various places in the implementation of
namespaces. Indeed, allowing multiple hard links to a file is a normal
feature of UNIX-type systems. Except in one case: Linux, like other UNIX
systems, forbids multiple hard links to a directory. The reliability of
various pieces of kernel and user-space code is predicated on that
assumption.  However, <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e9720acd728a46cb40daa52c99a979f7c4ff195c">a
Linux 2.6.25 patch</a> made early in the implementation of network
namespaces set in train some changes that quietly broke the assumption for
the directories under <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt>.

<p> Having determined the cause of the problem, the developers then needed
devise a suitable fix. At this point, pragmatic factors come into play,
since the task is not only to fix the kernel going forward, but also going
backward. In other words, the ideal solution would be one that could be
applied not only to the current kernel source tree and but also to the
stable and long-term kernel series. That led Linus <a
href="/Articles/545472/">to speculate</a> about the possibility of allowing
an exception to the rule that directory inodes are not allowed to have
multiple links. Since the locks in question are placed at the inode level,
why not change <tt>lock_rename()</tt> to replace the check on whether that
function is dealing with the same dentries with a check on whether it is
dealing with the same inodes?

<p> However, Al was quick <a href="/Articles/545520/">to point out</a> that
while modifying the check would solve the particular deadlock problem found
by Dave, other problems would remain.  The kernel code that deals with
those locks depends upon a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort">topological sort</a>
based on the hierarchical relationship between entries in the dcache; the
presence of multiple directory entries that link to the same inode renders
that sort unreliable.

<p> Al <a href="/Articles/545475/">went on</a> to describe what he
considered to be the full and proper solution: creating
<tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt> files as symbolic links to
per-network-namespace directories of the form
<tt>/proc/<i>netns-ID</i>/net</tt>, where <tt><i>netns-ID</i></tt> is a
per-namespace identifier. <a href="/Articles/545477/">Alternatively</a>,
the existing <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt> trees could be kept, but the
subdirectories could be created as duplicate subtrees rather than hard
links to a single directory subtree. Al was, however, <a
href="/Articles/545478/">unsure</a> about the feasibility of implementing
this solution as a patch that could be backported to past stable kernel
series.

<p> In the meantime, Linus came up with another
proposal. <tt>proc_get_inode()</tt>, the kernel function for allocating
inodes in the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem, has the following form:

<pre>
    struct inode *proc_get_inode(struct super_block *sb, struct proc_dir_entry *de)
    {
        struct inode *inode = iget_locked(sb, de->low_ino);

        if (inode &amp;&amp; (inode->i_state &amp; I_NEW)) {

            ...
            /* Populate fields in newly allocated cache entry pointed
               to by 'inode' */
               ...

            unlock_new_inode(inode);
        } else
            pde_put(de);
        return inode;
    }
</pre>

<p> The <tt>iget_locked()</tt> function searches the kernel's inode cache
for an inode whose number corresponds to that recorded in the dentry
structure <tt>de</tt>. It returns either a pointer to an existing entry,
or, if no entry could be found, it allocates a new uninitialized cache
entry that it returns to the caller. The <tt>proc_get_inode()</tt> function
then populates the fields of the newly allocated inode cache entry using
information from the dentry.

<p> The deadlock problem is a result of the fact that&mdash;because
multiple dentries map to the same inode&mdash;multiple locks may be placed
on the same entry in the inode cache. Conversely, deadlocks could be
avoided if it was possible to avoid placing multiple locks on the inode
entries returned from the cache.  As
Linus <a href="/Articles/545575/">noted</a>, in the case of <tt>/proc</tt>
files, it is not really necessary to find an existing entry in the cache,
because there is no on-disk representation for the inodes
under <tt>/proc</tt>.  Instead, <tt>proc_get_inode()</tt> could simply
always create a new cache entry via a call to <tt>new_inode_pseudo()</tt>
and populate that cache entry. Since a new cache entry is always created,
it will not be visible to any other process, so that there will be no
possibility of lock conflicts and deadlocks. In other words, the logic
of <tt>proc_get_inode()</tt> can be modified to be:

<pre>
    struct inode *proc_get_inode(struct super_block *sb, struct proc_dir_entry *de)
    {
        struct inode *inode = new_inode_pseudo(sb);

        if (inode) {
            inode->i_ino = de->low_ino;

            ...
            /* Populate fields in newly allocated cache entry pointed
               to by 'inode' */
            ...

        } else
           pde_put(de);
        return inode;
    }
</pre>

<p> Here, it is worth noting that the kernel uses two different allocation
schemes for the inodes under <tt>/proc</tt>: one scheme that is generally
employed for inodes under the <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i></tt> directories and
another for the inodes in the remainder of <tt>/proc</tt>. Linus's patch
affects only inode allocations for entries in the second category. However,
as a consequence of the implementation history, whereby <tt>/proc/net</tt>
was migrated to <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt>, the inodes under
<tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/net</tt> are allocated in the same fashion as inodes
outside <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i></tt>, and so the patch also affects those
inodes.

<p> In the subsequent <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=51f0885e5415b4cc6535e9cdcc5145bfbc134353">commit
message</a>, Linus noted that the patch could have been refined so that the
new behavior was applied only to directory entries, rather than all
entries, under <tt>/proc</tt>. However, in the interests of keeping the
change simple, no such differentiation was made.

<p> The effect of Linus's patch is to prevent multiple locks (and thus
deadlocks) on the same inode.  Al <a
href="/Articles/545508/">agreed</a> that the change should not be a
problem from a correctness perspective. On the other hand, this change also
has the effect of nullifying the benefits of inode caching for
<tt>/proc</tt> files outside <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i></tt>. Al wondered about
the performance impact of that change. However, some casual instrumentation
of the kernel <a href="/Articles/545574/">suggested</a> that the benefits
of inode caching for <tt>/proc</tt> are low in any case. In addition, Dave
<a href="/Articles/545506/">reported</a> that with the fix applied,
Trinity was no longer hitting the deadlock problem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

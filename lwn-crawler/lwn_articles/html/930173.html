No data structures found in the Linux kernel — at least, in any version
that escaped from Linus Torvalds's development machine — are older than the
buffer head.  Like many other legacies from the early days of Linux, buffer
heads have been targeted for removal for years.  They persist, though,
despite the problems they present.  Now, Christoph Hellwig has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230424054926.26927-1-hch@lst.de/">a patch
series</a> that enables the building of a kernel without buffer heads — but
the cost of doing so at this point will be more than most want to pay.
<p>
The first public release of the Linux kernel was version 0.01, and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source/include/linux/fs.h#L56"><tt>struct
buffer_head</tt></a> was a part of it:
<p>
<pre>
    struct buffer_head {
	char * b_data;			/* pointer to data block (1024 bytes) */
	unsigned short b_dev;		/* device (0 = free) */
	unsigned short b_blocknr;	/* block number */
	unsigned char b_uptodate;
	unsigned char b_dirt;		/* 0-clean,1-dirty */
	unsigned char b_count;		/* users using this block */
	unsigned char b_lock;		/* 0 - ok, 1 -locked */
	struct task_struct * b_wait;
	struct buffer_head * b_prev;
	struct buffer_head * b_next;
	struct buffer_head * b_prev_free;
	struct buffer_head * b_next_free;
    };
</pre>
<p>
While the best disk drives available decades ago were nominally "fast",
accessing data on disk was still slower, by several orders of magnitude,
than accessing data in main memory.  So the importance of caching file data
was well understood long before Linux was born.  The approach that was
generally in use at that time was to cache disk blocks, with filesystem
code operating on data in that cache; Torvalds followed that model with
Linux.  Thus, from the beginning, the Linux kernel included a "buffer
cache" that held copies of blocks found on the system's disks.
<p>
The <tt>buffer_head</tt> structure was the key to managing the buffer
cache.  The combination of the <tt>b_dev</tt> and <tt>b_blocknr</tt> fields
uniquely identified which block a given buffer cache entry referred to,
while <tt>b_data</tt> pointed to the cached data itself.  The other fields
tracked whether the block needed to be written back to disk, how many users
it had, and more.  It was a core part of the kernel's block I/O subsystem —
and of its memory management code as well.
<p>
Over time, it became clear that file caching could be done better if it
were implemented as a cache of <i>file</i> data, rather than of disk
blocks.  During the 1.3 development cycle, Torvalds began implementing a
new feature known as the "page cache", which would manage pages of data
from files, rather than disk blocks.  A number of advantages came from that
change; many operations on file data could avoid calling into the
filesystem code entirely if that data could be found in the cache, for
example.  Caching data at a higher level better matched how that data was
used, and the ability to cache full pages (generally eight times larger
than the 512-byte block size typically found at that time) improved
efficiency.
<p>
The only problem was that the buffer cache was deeply wired into both the
block subsystem and the filesystem implementations, so this cache continued
to exist, alongside the page cache, for several more years until the two
were unified.  Even then, the buffer cache was at the core of the API used
for block I/O.  This was not optimal: filesystems worked hard to store data
contiguously on disk, and the page cache could keep that data together in
memory with at least page granularity, but the buffer-head interface
required every I/O operation to be broken down into 512-byte blocks — each
with its own <tt>buffer_head</tt> structure.  That was a lot of overhead,
much of which just added work for storage drivers, which had to try to
reassemble larger chunks for reasonable I/O performance.

<p>
The 2.5 development series (the last of the odd-number development kernels
under the older model) addressed this problem by reworking the block layer
around <a href="/Articles/26404/">a new data structure called the "bio"</a>
that could represent block I/O requests more efficiently.  Over the years,
the bio has evolved considerably as the need to support ever-higher I/O
rates has grown, but it still remains the way that block I/O requests are
assembled and managed.
<p>
Meanwhile, though, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/include/linux/buffer_head.h#L52"><tt>struct
buffer_head</tt> can still be found</a> in current kernels.  And, more to
the point, a number of filesystems still use it.  The role that buffer
heads once played in cache management has long since ended, but they still
handle an important task in parts of the kernel: tracking the mapping
between data cached in memory and the location on persistent storage where
that data lives.  The kernel has a rather more modern interface (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/include/linux/iomap.h#L90">iomap</a>)
for this purpose, but not all subsystems are using it.
<p>
One of the holdouts is ext4, which still makes heavy use of buffer heads.
This filesystem, of course, is derived from ext2, which first entered the
kernel with the 0.99.7 release in early 1993.  Ext2 was based on block
pointers; each file would have a list associated with it containing the
numbers of the blocks on disk holding that file's data.  Such a layout,
where each block on disk is a separate entity (even if the filesystem tries
to keep them together) fits the buffer head model reasonably well.  So it
is not surprising the buffer heads were embedded deeply within ext2, and
are still there 30&nbsp;years later in ext4, even though ext4 <a
href="/Articles/187321/">gained support for extents</a> — a rather more
efficient representation of large files — in 2006.
<p>
Buffer heads, clearly, still work, but they still add overhead to file I/O.
They also present an obstacle to changes that developers want to make to
the memory-management and filesystem layers, including the ongoing <a
href="/Articles/893512/">folio work</a>.  So the desire to get rid of
buffer heads, which has been present for a long time, seems to be getting
stronger. 
<p>
But, as Hellwig's patch series shows, ext4 is not the only place where
buffer heads persist.  That series, after a bit of refactoring, adds a new
<tt>BUFFER_HEAD</tt> configuration option that controls the compilation of
buffer-head support.  Any code that needs buffer heads will select that
option; if a kernel is built without any code needing buffer heads, then
the resulting kernel will not have that support.  Such a kernel will be
lacking a few important features, though, including the ext4 filesystem,
but also F2FS, FAT, GFS2, HFS, ISO9660 (CDROM), JFS, NTFS, NTFS3, and the
device-mapper layer.  On the other hand, it is possible to build a
buffer-head-free kernel that supports Btrfs and XFS.
<p>
It seems unlikely that there will be many kernels built without buffer-head
support in the near future.  This work does, however, make it easier to see
where the remaining users are, which should help to focus work toward
getting rid of buffer heads for real.  That job is still likely to take
some time — one does not perform major surgery on a heavily used filesystem
in a hurry — and it may accelerate the removal of some old and unloved
filesystems (<a href="/Articles/920259/">like JFS</a>).  One of these
years, though, it will become possible to drop this core kernel data
structure that has been there since the beginning.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Oh! From that list of affected filesystems it looks like I could try out these patches on my desktop for fun… it would have to use FUSE instead for writing to the ESP but that mountpoint doesn't exactly need to win any races. (And honestly, I'm tired of being reminded DOS codepages exist when tweaking .config)<br>

My guess would be that ext4 is by far the most widely used filesystem for servers and certainly is for Android.  After that, I would guess that fat is still widely used for USB storage and iso9660 for install media (USB) and VMs.<br>

I would also mention that the EFI System Partition is almost always FAT, and the device-mapper layer is used to support LVM and dm-crypt/LUKS (among others), so (while not a filesystem per se) it would also need to be migrated early.<br>

           </div>
Network device drivers have been using the increasingly misnamed NAPI ("new
API") interface for some time now.  NAPI allows a network driver to
turn off interrupts from an interface and go into a polling mode.  Polling
is often seen as a bad thing, but it's really only a problem when poll
attempts turn up no useful work to do.  With a busy network interface,
there will always be new packets to process; "polling," in this situation, really means
"going off to deal with the accumulated work."  When there is always work
to do, interrupts informing the system of that fact are really just added
noise.  Your editor likes to compare the situation to email notifications;
anybody who gets a reasonable volume of email is quite likely to turn such
notifications off.  They are distracting, and there is probably always
email waiting whenever one gets around to checking.
<p>

NAPI is well suited to network drivers, since high packet rates can lead to
high interrupt rates, but it has not spread to other parts of the kernel,
where interrupt rates are lower.  That situation could change
in 2.6.32, though, if Jens Axboe follows through with his plan to merge the
new <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/346187/">blk-iopoll</a>
infrastructure into the mainline.  In short, blk-iopoll is NAPI for block
devices; indeed, some of the core code was borrowed from the NAPI
implementation. 
<p>

Converting a block driver to the blk-iopoll is straightforward.  Each
interrupting device needs to have a <tt>struct blk_iopoll</tt> structure
defined for it, presumably in the structure which describes the device
within the driver.  This structure should be initialized with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/blk-iopoll.h&gt;

    typedef int (blk_iopoll_fn)(struct blk_iopoll *, int);

    void blk_iopoll_init(struct blk_iopoll *iop, int weight, blk_iopoll_fn *poll_fn);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>weight</tt> value describes the relative importance of the device;
a higher weight results in more requests being processed in each polling
cycle.  As with NAPI, there is no definitive guidance as to what
<tt>weight</tt> should be; in Jens's initial patch, it is set to 32.  The
<tt>poll_fn()</tt> will be called when the block subsystem decides that it's
time to poll for completed requests.
<p>
I/O polling for a device is controlled with:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_iopoll_enable(struct blk_iopoll *iop);
    void blk_iopoll_disable(struct blk_iopoll *iop);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>blk_iopoll_enable()</tt> must be made by the driver before
any polling of the device will happen.  Enabling polling allows that
polling to occur, but does not <i>cause</i> it to happen.  There is no
point in polling a device which is not doing any work, so the block layer
will not actually poll a given device until the driver informs it that
there may be a reason to do so.
<p>
That normally happens when the device is actually interrupting.  The driver
can, in its interrupt handler, switch over to polling mode through a
three-step process.  The first is to check the global variable
<tt>blk_iopoll_enabled</tt>; if it is zero, block I/O polling cannot be
used.  Assuming polling is enabled, the driver should  prepare the
<tt>blk_iopoll</tt> structure with:
<p>
<pre>
    int blk_iopoll_sched_prep(struct blk_iopoll *iop);
</pre>
<p>
In the first version of the patch, a return value of zero means that the
preparation "failed," either because polling is disabled or because the
device is already in polling mode.  In future versions, the sense of the
return value is likely to be inverted to the more standard "zero means
success" mode.  If <tt>blk_iopoll_sched_prep()</tt> succeeds, the
driver can then call:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_iopoll_sched(struct blk_iopoll *iop);
</pre>
<p>
At this point, polling mode has been entered; the driver need only disable
interrupts from its device and return.  The "disable interrupts" step
should, of course, be done at the device itself; masking the IRQ line would
be an antisocial act in a world where those lines are shared.
<p>
Later on, the block layer will call the <tt>poll_fn()</tt> which was
provided to <tt>blk_iopoll_init()</tt>.  The prototype for this function
is:
<p>
<pre>
        typedef int (blk_iopoll_fn)(struct blk_iopoll *iop, int budget);
</pre>
<p>
The polling function is called (in software interrupt context) with
<tt>iop</tt> being the related 
<tt>blk_iopoll</tt> structure, and <tt>budget</tt> being the maximum number
of requests that the poll function should process.  In normal usage, the
driver's device-specific structure can be obtained from <tt>iop</tt> with
<tt>container_of()</tt>.  The <tt>budget</tt> value is just the
<tt>weight</tt> that was specified back at initialization time.
<p>
The return value should be the number of requests actually processed.
If the device consumes less than the given <tt>budget</tt>, it should turn
off further polling with:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_iopoll_complete(struct blk_iopoll *iopoll);
</pre>
<p>
Interrupts from the device should be re-enabled, since further polling
will not happen.  Note that the block layer assumes that a driver will
<i>not</i> call <tt>blk_iopoll_complete()</tt> if it has consumed its
full budget.  If it's necessary to return to interrupt mode despite having
exhausted the budget, the driver should either (1)&nbsp;use
<tt>blk_iopoll_disable()</tt>, or (2)&nbsp;lie about the number of requests
processed when returning from the polling function.
<p>

One might well wonder about the motivation behind all of this work.  Block
device interrupt handling has not traditionally been a performance
bottleneck.  The problem is the rapid improvement in solid-state storage
devices.  It is expected that, before too long, these devices will be
operating in the range of 100,000 I/O operations per second - far beyond
anything that rotating storage can do.  When dealing with that many I/O
operations, the kernel must take care to minimize the per-operation
overhead in any way possible.  As others have observed, the block layer
needs to become more like the network layer, with the per-request cost
squeezed to a bare minimum.  The blk-iopoll code is a step in that
direction.
<p>
How big a step?  Jens has posted <a href="/Articles/346256/">some
preliminary numbers</a> showing significant reductions in system time on a
random-read disk benchmark.  More testing will certainly be required; in
particular, some developers are concerned about the possibility of
increasing I/O latency.  But the initial numbers suggest that this work has
improved the efficiency of the block subsystem under load.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There's also rotating storage that does more than 100,000 IOPS today.  Hint: there are lots of spindles and heads.
<p>
The Linux systems where performance matters most aren't personal computers with a couple of disk drives.

           </div>
Like most actively developed programs, the kernel grows over time; there
have only been two development cycles ever (2.6.36 and 3.17) where the
kernel as a whole was 
smaller than its predecessor.  The kernel's internal API tends to grow in
size and complexity along with the rest.  The good thing about the internal
API, though, is that it is completely under the control of the development
community and can be changed at any time.  Among other things, that means
that parts of the kernel's internal API can be removed if they are no
longer needed — or if their addition in the first place is deemed to be a
mistake.  A pair of pending removals in the memory-management area shows how
this process can work.
<p>
<h4>GFP_TEMPORARY</h4>
<p>
One of the many challenges faced by the kernel's memory-management
subsystem is fragmentation.  If allocations are not placed carefully, the
system's free memory can end up split into many small chunks that cannot be
coalesced; that can lead to allocations failing even though much of the
system's memory is idle.  This is particularly true of memory allocations
for use by the kernel itself.  Those allocations can be long-lived and
there is usually no way to relocate them if they are in the way.  A single
small allocation can prevent the reuse of an entire page; that, in turn,
can block the creation of larger chunks of memory around that page.
<p>
It has long been understood that not all kernel memory allocations are
equal.  Some data structures are critical to the operation of the system
and cannot be removed; consider the structures describing a mounted
filesystem or a running process, for example.  Others, though, exist to
improve the system's performance and can be dropped if needed; the inode
and dentry caches in the virtual filesystem layer are perhaps the biggest
examples of this type of structure.  The latter type of structure is called
"reclaimable".
<p>
A key heuristic used within the memory-management subsystem is to try to
separate reclaimable and non-reclaimable allocations.  A page full of
reclaimable allocations can, in theory at least, be recovered for other
uses when memory is tight.  But a single non-reclaimable allocation will
prevent the reuse of the entire page.  Separating the two types increases
the probability that pages containing reclaimable allocations can, in
truth, be reclaimed should the need arise.
<p>
Back in 2007, Mel Gorman <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e12ba74d8ff3e2f73a583500d7095e406df4d093">added
the <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocation type</a> in an attempt to make memory
allocation more flexible.  The reasoning was this: some memory allocations
last a long time, while others are highly transient. 
A structure allocated to represent a newly added device may persist
for the lifetime of the system, while memory allocated to satisfy a system
call may be returned within milliseconds.  When an allocation is
short-lived, it doesn't matter whether it is reclaimable or not; since it
will be returned shortly regardless, it is unlikely to hold up the reclaim
of a page full of otherwise reclaimable allocations.  So
<tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocations were allowed to draw from the
reclaimable pool, even though there was no mechanism by which they could be
reclaimed.
<p>
Earlier this year, <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> was <a
href="/Articles/713076/">the subject of an extensive discussion</a> that
was, at the start, focused on a seemingly simple question: what does
"temporary" mean?  Is there a limit on how long the allocation can be held?
Is the holder of a <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocation allowed to block or
take locks?  It turns out that this was not specified when
<tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> was added.  The discussion failed to fill that void, 
and a review of the <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> call sites in the kernel revealed
some decidedly non-temporary uses.  It became clear that nobody really
knew what a "temporary" allocation was supposed to be.
<p>
There was talk of trying to nail down that definition, but Michal Hocko
pushed a different approach: <a href="/Articles/729145/">remove
<tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> entirely</a>.  The current uses, he said, did not
justify keeping it around:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I have checked some random users and none of them has added the
	flag with a specific justification. I suspect most of them just
	copied from other existing users and others just thought it might
	be a good idea to use without any measuring. This suggests that
	GFP_TEMPORARY just motivates for cargo cult usage without any
	reasoning.
</div>
<p>
There were a handful of complaints about the loss of the flag, but no
serious opposition to the change.  Other developers, <a
href="/Articles/732108/">including Neil Brown</a>, agreed with the change:
<P>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If we have a flag that doesn't have a well defined meaning that
	actually affects behavior, it will not be used consistently, and if
	we ever change exactly how it behaves we can expect things to
	break.  So it is better not to have a flag, than to have a poorly
	defined flag.
</div>
<p>
He suggested improving the kernel's notion of reclaimability of allocations
instead.  That may happen in the future, but the removal of
<tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> is set to happen more quickly.  The patches are in
linux-next now, meaning they are on track to hit the mainline during the
4.14 merge window.  Should that happen, <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> will itself
prove to have been temporary — for a "ten years" value of "temporary".
<p>
<h4>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</h4>
<p>
The allocation of memory for direct memory access (DMA) operations is not
as simple as it might seem.  Devices often have a different view of memory
than the CPU does, and allocations for DMA must bridge that gap.  These
allocations must usually be physically contiguous, and they have to be in a
region of memory that the target device is able to access, for example.  An
interesting additional requirement is handled by
<tt>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    void *dma_alloc_noncoherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
    				dma_addr_t *dma_handle, gfp_t flag);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</tt> is an explicit
request to allocate a DMA buffer in a noncoherent region of memory.
Memory that is cache-coherent looks the same to both the CPU and I/O
devices.  If the CPU writes to that memory, its writes will be visible to
the device; similarly, if the device writes a region of memory, the CPU
will immediately see the new data.  Noncoherent memory lacks that
guarantee; if the CPU 
wants to read data placed into memory via a DMA operation, it must take
care to invalidate its own memory caches after the completion of the I/O
operation, but before its
first access.  
<p>
Noncoherent memory is clearly trickier to work with; without sufficient
care, it is easy to end up with corrupted data.  So one might wonder why
anybody would want to ask for it specifically.  The answer is that on
architectures where cache coherence doesn't come naturally (ARM, for
example), coherent memory is far slower.  Turning on coherence generally
involves turning off caching, with a predictable effect on performance.  For
situations involving any significant data processing, using coherent memory
is just not an option.
<p>
It is thus important to be able to allocate noncoherent memory for DMA
buffers, which raises the question of why Christoph Hellwig is <a
href="/Articles/732109/">working to remove
<tt>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</tt></a>.  The answer is that, on any
reasonably current system, control over memory access modes is more
sophisticated than 
simply turning caching on or off.  Memory can be configured to allow write
combining (where multiple write operations can be grouped by the hardware
for performance), for example, or it can be set to allow operations
to be reordered.  Many of these features can be configured together.
Creating new allocation function for each combination is clearly unlikely
to lead to joy, so the kernel developers added a new set of functions in
the 3.4 development cycle, including:
<p>
<pre>
    void *dma_alloc_attrs(struct device *dev, size_t size, dma_addr_t *dma_handle,
			  gfp_t flag, unsigned long attrs);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>attrs</tt> field can be used to specify <a
href="/Articles/732110/">a whole range of attributes</a>, including
<tt>DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT</tt> to obtain a noncoherent mapping.  This
function clearly fills the same role as <tt>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</tt>
and a lot more besides, so there is little reason to keep
<tt>dma_alloc_coherent()</tt> around.  Hellwig has been working to remove
it, which means updating all of its callers to use
<tt>dma_alloc_attrs()</tt> instead.  Much of that work went in during the
4.13 merge window; only three call sites remain.  His current patches
remove those last three, along with the function itself.  Any out-of-tree
drivers using <tt>dma_alloc_noncoherent()</tt> will have to be updated
separately, of course.
<p>
In both cases, the kernel's internal API is getting (slightly) smaller, but
no functionality is being lost.  This work is an example of the sort of
cleanups that are possible when there is no need to maintain API
compatibility.  Interfaces exposed to user space must be preserved, but the
ability to evolve internally is a big part of why the kernel remains
maintainable despite having just celebrated its 26th birthday.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Intel, ARM and the Linux DMA API all disagree on the meaning of coherent and consistent (the DMA-API docs are even inconsistent with it's usage) which doesn't map well at all to, say, ARM's memory models and types.<br>
<p>
That's because the DMA API is written from the point of view of the DMA device, although that doesn't make sense either; implying coherency of memory by using the property of consistency (which isn't the same thing at all) is really a very strange concept, and doesn't involve cache-coherency at all (although it does involve disabling caching to try and gain the property of coherency).<br>
<p>
I fail to see how removing dma_alloc_noncoherent would be controversial. But I also think someone should really consider the insanity of an API that writing software that runs on the CPU yet defining memory allocation and memory usage from the point of view of the device. As far as I can tell WRITE_COMBINE, WEAK_ORDERING, NON_CONSISTENT could be cacheable memory or not (the Device-GRnE type covers it beautifully!) - it would replace dma_alloc_noncoherent by making the same relaxations, but it isn't specific enough to cover the possibilities. Hopefully the next step is actually fixing that..<br>

dma_alloc_noncoherent is very different from the others, and was never supported on ARM because it must be paired with dma_cache_sync() that is not implementable on architectures on which we must use cache flushes to make normal memory coherent.<br>
<p>
I think it was introduced for SGI Origin or Altix machines, big NUMA boxes on which dma_alloc_coherent memory was very expensive and other memory could be made coherent using a simple synchronizing operation on the interconnect.<br>
<p>
If we remove dma_alloc_noncoherent, we have to kill off dma_cache_sync as well, and maybe think about removing support for the machines that relied on it.<br>

I think it was actually PA-RISC.  There are some early machines (710, 720, 730, 750) where there is no IOMMU, and no concept of cache coherent DMA.  I think that supporting V class would also require noncoherent memory, but that effort is extremely unlikely to be undertaken at this point.<br>

My mistake, I misremembered indeed. On platform with explicit (but sane) cache management, the dma_cache_sync() model can work but is twice as expensive as the ownership model of the streaming API, as it requires the flush and/or invalidate to be performed for every sync rather than every other one.<br>
<p>
On platforms that require bouncing (e.g. swiotlb) however it is worse. Here, the operation for DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL is undefined since dma_cache_sync() cannot decide which direction to copy the data.<br>
<p>
On cache architectures that do speculative prefetching and also write back prefetched (clean) cache lines during a flush you get the same problem, where dma_cache_sync has to decide between writeback and invalidate. No sane architecture would do such a thing of course, which means that it probably happens on at least one ARM implementation but not elsewhere :-).<br>

<p>
Every other sync?<br>
<p>
In terms of DMA direction, if you put data in memory from the CPU and DMA needs to read it, you Clean to PoC. If you need to read memory that DMA wrote, you need to Invalidate to PoC. The requirements are super explicit (and a natural consequence of software-managed coherency). There's no every-other-sync.<br>
<p>
Lets imagine you have two buffers - a source and a destination. Your CPU writes to the source and expects the DMA to write to the destination. You need to dma_cache_sync(DMA_TO_DEVICE) to make sure the source buffer is not just in the CPU caches, and the DMA can see it. That's your Clean to PoC. We actually talk about C&amp;I here because there's no point not invalidating those lines if you're going to discard the source buffer and deal with the destination, but dma_cache_sync() implementations usually err on the side of letting natural cache behaviour deal with it, just in case the CPU goes back to the source.<br>
<p>
When your CPU needs to read the destination data, it MUST perform an architecturally required invalidate of that range. Why? Because of speculation. The CPU pipeline is constantly fetching instructions ahead, guessing at addresses for loads and stores, and speculatively issuing them to address generation and load-store units. If you dma_unmap_foo() a region and then access it in some unbounded period of time, the CPU may have guessed this, and prefetched the data before the DMA has finished it's operation. The invalidate and the required barriers (see Barrier Litmus Tests) prevent the CPUs from having stale (inconsistent) data in the caches.<br>
<p>
There's no elision of cache maintenance that lets you only manage the caches every other time, or only on one side, otherwise you essentially create a mess. You might not notice on an ARM7TDMI but you will notice a hell of a lot on a Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, or any of the shinier 64-bit cores.<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't think that users should have to care about this. They may have some extreme requirements that the memory absolutely not be cached for a particular reason, but otherwise the DMA API should give you Normal memory, cacheable if possible. Unless you are dealing with phenomenally small amounts of data where a cache line size dwarfs the data you want to keep consistent, or phenomenally large areas where you'd just pollute the cache by dealing with any of it on the CPU, you want the CPU to be able to cache it. And as CPUs get faster and faster and more complex, generating non-cacheable transactions is a performance bear of it's own making; the consensus (which is wrong) is that "DMA activity must happen in uncacheable areas to save on explicit maintenance, which is costly." Significant amounts of software make this assumption. Significant amounts of software then cannot deal with the fact that uncacheable areas of memory are extremely costly to access (even if you have the best merging store buffer or load queueing on the planet) compared to cacheable ones. 1000s of cycles of latency to go all the way out to DRAM vs. single digit cycles, maybe double digits to get to cache. You forfeit prefetching (both automatic and explicit) COMPLETELY if it's uncacheable.  Significant amounts of software hobbles the CPU on every load and store, so that you can save a couple thousand cycles at the pinch point of CPU&lt;&gt;DMA handoff.<br>
<p>
Significant amounts of software therefore don't use dma_alloc_noncoherent (which is your easiest way to hint you want cacheable memory) and if it does, it can get it another way, but the specificity of dma_alloc_attrs doesn't even cover the case - it's merely "please don't give a crap about being strongly ordered and sequentially consistent, I can deal with cache maintenance happening at that pinch point if need be, or I know my device is IO coherent". The funny thing about being IO coherent (i.e. DMA can snoop CPU caches - AXI4 ACE-Lite at least) is that it's completely pointless to implement if you can't guarantee cacheable memory with the appropriate type for CPUs and interconnect to manage coherency. If you can't SPECIFICALLY define it as Normal Cacheable then there's technology going to waste.<br>
<p>
And there's my point, right there; the Linux DMA API is hideous and losing dma_alloc_noncoherent won't hurt anyone any more than it already hurts.<br>

What I mean with "every other sync" is that we can save one of the dma_sync_*_to_{device,cpu} operations. In the example you just gave,  the streaming DMA API will always write back the cache for dma_sync_*_to_device(DMA_TO_DEVICE) and it will always invalidate the cache for  dma_sync_*_to_cpu(DMA_TO_CPU), while the corresponding  dma_sync_*_to_cpu(DMA_TO_DEVICE) and dma_sync_*_to_device(DMA_TO_CPU) operations can often be implemented as no-op (on ARM, we do an extra invalidate for the latter in case we have a dirty cache line. IIRC some others only do this for map() but not sync(), and rely on the CPU not dirtying the cache lines while the CPU owns the buffer).<br>
<p>
Having both dma_sync_*_to_device() and dma_sync_*_to_cpu() do the same operation the way that MIPS (on speculating CPU cores) does means that you need to do two writeback operations for one DMA_TO_DEVICE and two invalidations for one DMA_TO_CPU (which may well be necessary anyway, depending who you ask) in the streaming API.<br>
<p>
With dma_alloc_noncoherent()/dma_cache_sync() you have no ownership information at all, so you either end up doing the double operations as well, or the driver has to make assumptions about the hardware platform to decide to skip either the equivalent of the dma_sync_*_to_cpu() or the dma_sync_*_to_device() call (I assume most drivers do the latter).<br>
Note that using dma_alloc_noncoherent() with dma_sync_*_to_cpu/device(), or using dma_map_*() with dma_cache_sync() is not well-defined and both can blow up spectacularly depending on the implementation of the dma_map_ops.<br>

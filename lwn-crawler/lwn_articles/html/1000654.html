           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 6, 2024</br>

The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12.1/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L35"><tt>page</tt>
structure</a> sits at the core of the kernel's memory-management subsystem
(for now), and a key part of that structure is its reference count, stored
in <tt>refcount</tt>.  The page reference count tells the kernel how many
users a given page has and when it can be freed.  That count is not needed
for every page in the system, though.  Matthew Wilcox has recently <a
href="/ml/all/20241125210149.2976098-1-willy@infradead.org">resurrected</a>
an <a href="/ml/linux-mm/20220809171854.3725722-1-willy@infradead.org/">old
patch set</a> that expands the concept of a "frozen" page — one that lacks a
meaningful reference count — to the immediate benefit of the slab allocator
but in the service of a longer-term goal as well.
<p>
The kernel is in the business of managing resources that are shared between
multiple users.  For example, anonymous (data) pages and file-backed pages
can both be mapped into the address space of one or more processes; each
mapping increases the relevant page's reference count, ensuring that the
page stays around as long as it is needed.  Reference counts can be a
relatively efficient way to manage object lifecycles, but they are not
free.  Frequent reference-count changes can cause cache-line bouncing, and
the atomic operations needed to change a reference count are relatively
expensive.  So there is value in <i>not</i> using a reference count when
the opportunity arises.
<p>
In the case of the <tt>struct page</tt> reference count, its use is so
deeply ingrained within the memory-management subsystem that it is
maintained for almost all pages in the system — even those for which it is
not needed.  One case, in particular, is the slab allocator, which
allocates groups of pages, splits them into smaller objects, and hands
those objects out on request.  A call to <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is the most
common way to get memory from the slab allocator.  Since it must track the
status of each of the sub-objects contained within a page, the slab
allocator knows whether the page as a whole is in use or not; it does not
need a separate reference count for that purpose.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
Even so, pages given to the slab allocator are reference-counted.  The
overhead of maintaining that reference count may not seem like much, but it
can add up, especially under workloads that exercise the slab allocator
heavily.  Given the amount of effort that goes into optimizing the kernel
for even tiny gains, eliminating this potentially costly atomic operation
seems like a worthwhile goal on its own.
<p>
<h4>Frozen pages</h4>
<p>
Wilcox's patch set expands on the notion of a "frozen" page — one for which
the reference count has been frozen (with a value of zero) and is not in
use.  In current kernels, frozen pages are only used in the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html">hugetlbfs
subsystem</a>, which maintains a reserve of huge pages for application use.
In that case, frozen pages are used to avoid manipulating reference counts
while assembling larger pages, but the concept is more widely useful.
<p>
In current kernels, a page's reference count is initialized with a call to
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12.1/source/mm/internal.h#L440"><tt>set_page_refcounted()</tt></a>,
which sets the count to one.  This initialization is done deeply
within the page-allocation paths; there are only three call sites in the
entire kernel.  The bulk of the patch set is, perhaps surprisingly,
dedicated to adding many more of those call sites.  In short, the
<tt>set_page_refcounted()</tt> calls are pushed down the call stack into
the callers of the low-level allocation functions.  This change enables the
existence of allocation paths that never set the reference count at all.
Still, it may seem like a counterproductive change;
<tt>set_page_refcounted()</tt> turns into a single assignment instruction
(no atomic operations are needed for the initial reference), and the code
was arguably cleaner before this change.  There are reasons to do things
this way, though, as we will see.
<p>
Once those calls have all been pushed down, a new allocation function (a
macro, in truth) is added:
<p>
<pre>
    struct page *alloc_frozen_pages(gfp_t gpf_flags, unsigned int order);
</pre>
<p>
Along with that, the existing <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13-rc1/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L2641"><tt>free_unref_page()</tt></a>
is renamed to <tt>free_frozen_pages()</tt>.  The latter function is where
the bigger savings is to be found.  The normal function for freeing pages
(<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13-rc1/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L4811"><tt>__free_pages()</tt></a>
or one of its callers) works by decrementing the reference count of the
pages passed to it; it only actually frees the pages when the count goes to
zero.  <tt>free_frozen_pages()</tt> can avoid the atomic decrement-and-test
operation on the reference count, since it knows that there are no other
references to the page.
<p>
Once that work is done, the final step is <a
href="/ml/all/20241125210149.2976098-16-willy@infradead.org">a small
patch</a> causing the slab allocator to use <tt>alloc_frozen_pages()</tt>
and <tt>free_frozen_pages()</tt> rather than <tt>alloc_pages()</tt> and
<tt>__free_pages()</tt>.   The unneeded atomic operation is eliminated, and
the slab allocator is presumably that much faster — though no benchmark
results have been included to quantify that.
<p>
<h4>The future is glorious</h4>
<p>
Performance patches normally should include benchmarks, but the performance
improvement here is really more of a side effect; the real purpose driving
this work is something different.  Since the beginning of the <a
href="/Articles/849538/">folio transition</a> some years ago, one of the
end goals has been the reduction of the size of <tt>struct page</tt>.  This
structure is as small as developers could make it but, since one of them
exists for every page in the system, <tt>page</tt> structures still end up
occupying roughly 1.5% of the memory in the system.  Reclaiming some of
that overhead for productive use is an attractive prospect.

<p>
The long-term goal is to reduce <tt>struct page</tt> to a single, 64-bit <a
href="https://kernelnewbies.org/MatthewWilcox/Memdescs">memory
descriptor</a> that indicates how each page is being used and contains a
pointer to a structure with the information needed for that usage.  For
example, slab pages can be <a href="/Articles/881039/">described by
<tt>struct slab</tt></a>; that structure exists in current kernels, but is
carefully crafted as an overlay on top of <tt>struct page</tt>.  In a
future world, a single <tt>struct slab</tt> could exist for an entire folio
of slab pages, reducing the memory-management overhead for those pages; a
pointer to that structure would be placed into each of the relevant memory
descriptors.
<p>
In current kernels, <tt>struct slab</tt>, being an overlay on <tt>struct
page</tt>, contains the <tt>refcount</tt> field; that will remain true even
if Wilcox's patch set is merged.  But, in a future where <tt>struct
slab</tt> no longer needs to overlay <tt>struct page</tt>, that reference
count can be removed, shrinking <tt>struct slab</tt>.  And that is, indeed,
the future toward which Wilcox is looking:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This patchset is also a step towards the Glorious Future in which
	struct page doesn't have a refcount; the users which need a
	refcount will have one in their per-allocation memdesc.
</blockquote>
<p>
Many steps toward the "<q>Glorious Future</q>" have already been taken;
some of the type-specific memory descriptors (such as <tt>struct slab</tt>)
have already been merged, and others are in the works.  There has been an
ongoing effort to move information out of <tt>struct page</tt> and into
<tt>struct folio</tt> where appropriate.  Other projects, like <a
href="/ml/all/Z09hOy-UY9KC8WMb@casper.infradead.org">the removal of the
<tt>index</tt> member</a> from <tt>struct page</tt>, are ongoing.  This
member, which is used for page-cache pages, tells the kernel the offset of
the page within the file it represents on disk; it is being shifted over to
the <tt>folio</tt> structure.  That work depends, in turn, on the <a
href="/ml/all/20241205175000.3187069-1-willy@infradead.org">zswap
memory-descriptor transition</a>, which is also in progress.  There are
many other steps yet to be taken, but at the conclusion of this work,
<tt>struct page</tt> should mostly have just withered away.
<p>
So, while the removal of a single atomic operation from the slab
allocator's page-freeing path is only so exciting, this patch series is
rather more interesting as a piece in the larger memory-descriptor project.
The core of the kernel's memory-management subsystem is going through a
period of radical (and much-needed) change that will make it more
efficient, flexible, and maintainable in the long term, and most users are
not even noticing.  The task is somewhat like exchanging the foundation
underneath a skyscraper while it remains open for business; in the kernel
community, though, it's just development as usual.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm not a fan of the word "frozen" in this context. It suggests that the page *content* is frozen, not just its reference count. Maybe something like "extern_refcount"?<br>

We already have the name "frozen", eg page_ref_freeze(), page_ref_unfreeze(). It's a temporary step anyway; eventually there won't be a difference between frozen and unfrozen pages because they won't have a refcount.<br>

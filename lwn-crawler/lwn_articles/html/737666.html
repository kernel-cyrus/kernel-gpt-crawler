<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2017/">2017 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The kernel development community has run for some years without anybody
tracking regressions; that changed one year ago when Thorsten Leemhuis
stepped up to the task.  Two conversations were held on the topic at the
2017 Kernel and Maintainers summits in Prague; this article covers the
first of those, held during the open Kernel-Summit track.
<p>
Leemhuis begin by pointing out that he started doing this work even though he
does not work for a Linux company; he is, instead, a journalist for the
largest computer magazine in Germany.  He saw a mention of the gap that
was left after Rafael Wysocki stopped <a href="/Articles/414223/">tracking
regressions</a>, and thought 
that he might be a good fit for the job.  This work is being done in his
spare time.  When he started, he had thought that the job would be
difficult and frustrating; in reality, it turned out to be even worse than
he expected.
<p>
Why is it so hard?  The first problem is that nobody actually tells him
about regressions, so he has to hunt them down himself.  That means digging
through a lot of mailing lists and bug trackers.  Wysocki noted that things
are worse than they were years ago when he did the job, there are a lot
more information sources.  It is more, Wysocki said, than any one person
can follow.
<p>
Leemhuis went on to say that a lot of regressions are also
fixed without him even noticing.  Nobody tells him about progress toward
fixing regressions, so that, too, must be tracked manually.  He had <a
href="/Articles/729620/">asked developers</a> to include a special
identifier in discussions on regressions, but nobody has done it.  That is
unfortunate, since he had thought it would be a useful mechanism; perhaps,

<a href="/Articles/737668/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/osse/ThorstenLeemhuis-sm.jpg" alt="[Thorsten
Leemhuis]" title="Thorsten Leemhuis" class="lthumb"></a>

he said, he should have tried harder.  Ben Herrenschmidt agreed, saying
that it can be hard to get people to change their established workflow to
incorporate a new mechanism.  James Bottomley noted that maintainers would,
in general, rather avoid having their bugs termed "regressions", since that
increases the pressure for an immediate fix.
<p>
Leemhuis raised the idea of creating a dedicated mailing list for regressions,
with reporters asked to copy their reports there.  Wysocki agreed that this
might be useful, but said that the information on how to report regressions
properly needs to be better communicated.  Laura Abbott concurred, saying
that the documentation in this area should be improved.
<p>
Herrenschmidt noted that most bug reports come from distributor kernels
rather than the mainline.  For distributions like Fedora, which ships
something close to a current mainline kernel, these reports can be
relevant, though are still a version or two behind the current development
kernels.  Reports of bugs in enterprise kernels, instead, have little
value.  Bottomley added that Linus Torvalds is mostly interested in
mainline regressions; the resources just don't exist to track regressions
in distributor kernels as well.
<p>
There was general agreement that only mainline regressions should be
tracked, but Ted Ts'o said that the community could look for volunteers to
track regressions in older kernel versions.  The work is still useful, he
said, and would train others to help with regression tracking.  The problem
with this idea, Bottomley replied, is that one has to be an idiot to want
to do this work — an idea that Leemhuis seemed to concur with.  There
won't, Bottomley added, be a flood of volunteers in this area.  Matthew
Wilcox's suggestion that the situation could change because there are a lot
of journalists being laid off was not seen as entirely helpful.
<p>
Abbott said that, in her role as a Fedora kernel maintainer, she sees a lot
of bug reports, but many of them are of low quality.  They need to be
filtered before being passed on to any sort of core regression list.  Arnd
Bergmann added that Linaro has been doing more testing recently and finding
regressions in linux-next.  But Leemhuis said he is really only interested
in regressions that make it to the mainline at this point.
<p>
Leemhuis went on to say that, while Wysocki used the kernel's Bugzilla
tracker to handle regressions, it "looks like double-entry accounting" to
him and he has avoided it.  There is a lot of overhead associated with
working in Bugzilla, and kernel developers tend not to like it.  So he has
been using the mailing lists instead, but perhaps that was the wrong
decision?
<p>
Wysocki replied that he used Bugzilla because it was suitable for him; it
provided a useful archive of the discussions around regressions.  Ts'o said
that the real problem is that Torvalds will not dictate a single
bug-tracking system for the kernel, so the information is scattered around
the community.  The kernel Bugzilla is not perfect, he said, but it has the
advantage of actually existing and being available.  Wysocki added that
there needs to be a database somewhere; it should be possible to point
people to a definitive entry for a regression.  Takashi Iwai said that, for
distributors, the most important thing to have is an overview of the
situation; that is missing now.  There is no comprehensive list of
problems, so distributors must go through the time-consuming task of
polling a number of different bug trackers.
<p>
Wilcox asked if distributors use the regression list for decisions on
which kernel versions to ship, or whether those decisions are purely based
on time.  Abbott replied that Fedora tries to ship the latest mainline
kernel, but the decision on pushing a specific kernel does depend on the
current regressions.  A significant Intel or AMD graphics regression will
cause a kernel to be held back, she said, while "an obscure USB dongle"
problem will not. 
<p>
Ben Hutchings said that the situation at Debian is similar, at least
outside of the long-term support releases.  Iwai said that openSUSE
Tumbleweed ships the latest kernel, meaning that regression reports are
relevant to the current mainline release, not the development kernel that
the kernel developers are 
working on currently.  There are, he said, not many people testing the -rc
kernels.  Jiri Kosina added that SUSE tracks the "Fixes" tags in patches to
see which bug fixes are relevant to the kernels they have shipped; those
fixes will be backported if needed.  That has led to a reduction in the
regressions reported with openSUSE kernels.
<p>
Leemhuis asked if he should query developers via email more often the way
Wysocki did; Wysocki replied that he didn't do that — his scripts did.
Mark Brown said that was a good thing, since the scripts were more polite
than their author.  Overall, there didn't appear to be any opposition to
more email if that's what is needed to improve regression tracking.
<p>
As the discussion came to a close, it was noted that regression reporting
is hard for most users.  They don't know where to send their reports, and
there is little information out there to help them.  The noise on the
mailing lists does not help.  The kernel Bugzilla is especially
problematic since it is the wrong place to report many bugs, but it's not
clear which ones or where they should actually go.  Ts'o said that, if it
were up to him, he would designate the Bugzilla as being for all kernel
bugs, and that 
subsystem maintainers would simply be told to cope with it.  In the absence
of such a policy, users will continue to struggle.
<p>
The final suggestion came from Abbott, who said that perhaps users who send
email to the linux-kernel list (and nobody else) should get an automatic
response.  That response would inform them that email sent only to the list
is unlikely to be read by many people and would thus probably not get a
response.  It would include suggestions regarding how to more successfully
report bugs.  This idea was generally well received.
<p>
This topic <a href="/Articles/738216/">was revisited during the
invitation-only Maintainers Summit</a> two days later.

We quite often find kernel bugs when working on rr. For severe bugs, especially regressions, we post to LKML and address specific maintainers because it's the only way to get a timely response (although not guaranteed). Less severe bugs go to Bugzilla because it doesn't seem like a good idea to spam specific maintainers with such bugs. As this article says, a message sent to LKML without addressing specific individuals will be forever lost in the noise. It seems that the Bugzilla bugs are only rarely looked at, though, so we file them more because it's the right thing to do than because we need action.<br>
<p>
Requiring bug reporters to directly email maintainers about specific bugs seems really bad for everyone. It makes the bar for reporting bugs very high, since you need to track down the right maintainers, which is practically impossible for end users, and if you guess wrong then your bug is likely to be ignored. I assume it also sucks for maintainers, since it must be difficult to share the workload between maintainers or if the maintainers change, plus every maintainer has to implement their own issue tracking in their email client.<br>
<p>
It's amazing how far Linux has come with such immature development practices across the board. This nonsense is tolerated because Linux is so successful, but in a less successful project it would be scorned. If a serious alternative open-source kernel ever arises with more rational development practices and takes share from Linux, people will look back and say "how did they ever think developing *that* way was a good idea?"<br>

I think you could make a good case for both. I think it's pretty clear that lack of centralized issue tracking is a big problem now. But you could also argue that lack of centralized issue tracking made life easier or more fun for developers in the past, and that helped get Linux where it is today.<br>
<p>
I just don't like to see questionable Linux development practices justified by "Linux is successful, so this must be right".<br>

Isn't the information in this article evidence enough? Distro kernel people are independently tracking regressions. Wouldn't it be better if they could share data with each other, and with the maintainers who are also tracking regressions?<br>
<p>
Whether maintainers are tracking regressions in their heads, in a text file, writing notes on a napkin, or however, they are doing it, just in a way that's inaccessible to others.<br>

I must confess that I don't really understand this fascination with tracking regressions.<br>
As a developer or maintainer, my only interest in regressions is fixing them.  Once fixed they don't need to be tracked - though they are usually recorded using Fixes: tags.<br>
As a user, I still just want it to be fixed, though finding a work-around, or reverting to an old version are certainly options. So I look for someone to complain to and make a noise.<br>
<p>
How is centralized tracking meant to help?  I don't imagine that its use as a management-metric would really matter to most people. Seriously:  who cares?<br>

      I do believe the point is to (1) have a sense for how ready a given kernel is, and (2) increase the odds that regressions get fixed rather than falling through the cracks.

I'd add (3) (or many (2b)): get maintainers back on track in case they do not take regressions seriously (like it was the case recently with AppArmor: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/10/3/1">https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/10/3/1</a>)<br>

This is not an example of "maintaining a regression list is useful".  This is an example of "members of the community supporting each other to encourage change".  James reported a regression, the maintainer disagreed, someone else (Thorsten, and eventually Linus) joined in to make the case.<br>
You don't need a maintained list of regressions to get things fixed (and I doubt it helps much).  You need people to care and report and contribute and persist.<br>
<p>
We always need more competent people to follow issues in various fora, to review not only patches but also bug reports and design discussions and anything else.  In this case Thorsten Leemhuis joined in and pushed things along.  This was a valuable contribution to be applauded, but it is not a contribution that needs to be centralized; it just needs to be done.  Were you following the thread at the time?  Maybe even you could have pushed things along.<br>

<p>
Given that mainline is the only focus discussed, and given the current development model, this seems to mean "should Linus release an -rc7, go straight to -final".  If that is ever a hard decision, the just default to -rc7.  In fact, I wonder why we don't have a fixed N-week cycle (with variation on if Linus' holidays require it).<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; (2) increase the odds that regressions get fixed rather than falling through the cracks</font><br>
<p>
Does it though? And is it the most beneficial way to achieve that?<br>
<p>
My core point is that regression tracking is best done in a distributed fashion  (like everything else in the community except "being Linus" which is centralized).  If you find a regression then it is your responsibility to push for a solution, just as if I find a regression it is mine.  If we both hit the same regression then we might end up working together and pushing harder for less individual effort.<br>
The more people who take responsibility, the more data, testing, and expertise is available, and the more likely it is that a fix will be found.   I think that reporting a bug and following through to a solution is a good way for people of any skill level to feel connected with the community. Giving people responsibility is an important first step to them taking it.  If a "regression maintainer" takes that responsibility, we say to the community "we don't need you".<br>

Maybe instead we say “check with this person” and “I know you don’t have time or don’t know how to follow up, so here’s someone who’s committed to making that easy”.<br>

In my experience, when I report a kernel regression maintainers do not drop everything else to fix it right away. (Nor should they necessarily; I imagine maintainers sometimes have higher-priority work to do than fix a minor regression.)<br>

Tracking helps reduce future regressions; e.g. if there's a clear trend for more regressions in one part of one subsystem, then it's a clear guide that more review and testing (preferably automated testing) should target that area. The amount of automated testing against the kernel is definitely rising, and so having a guide for that work is highly likely to be useful.<br>

Another thought:<br>
Regressions can sort of... sneak in.  They are often unintended side-effects of changes, and can gradually accumulate because no one is looking at an area (notably of performance) any more.  And then, gradually, something that used to be all tuned up doesn’t work well any more.<br>
<p>
That’s a slightly different argument, though.  I, like you, don’t really understand tracking regressions vs new bugs.  So little of the kernel is actually providing totally novel functionality, outside of drivers, that I think most bugs could be considered regressions in a certain light.  I mean, when you do the next rewrite of path lookup, that’s great and useful work, but it doesn’t provide new end user functionality, just performance.  So I guess any bugs in it are regressions...?<br>

The current situation is that end users have to figure out if their 'regression' is fixed by trial and error.  I believe the desire is some sort of useful bug tracker or documentation that can be referenced rather than having to compute by braille. Software projects with more moderate rates of change tend to have summary changelogs but that's probably mission impossible for the kernel.  Perhaps a serious user-space regression changelog is in within the realm of possible?<br>

How else can you ever really know?  It is standard-operating-procedure, when you hit a problem, to make sure you are running the latest version of everything - isn't it?  It is only when you experience a bug on the latest software that any of this becomes important.<br>
Surely the best way to find out if the regression is known is to use "your favorite search engine".  That doesn't require a centralized regression list (except that one automatically maintained by the engine's web crawler).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; As the discussion came to a close, it was noted that regression</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; reporting is hard for most users. They don't know where to send</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; their reports, and there is little information out there to help</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; them. The noise on the mailing lists does not help. The kernel</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Bugzilla is especially problematic since it is the wrong place to</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; report many bugs, but it's not clear which ones or where they</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; should actually go.</font><br>
<p>
MAINTAINERS has "B:" entry to specify the preferred channel for bug reports per subsystem. That's a start. But it needs to be used more, and then made more accessible to bug reporters.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Ts'o said that, if it were up to him, he would designate the</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Bugzilla as being for all kernel bugs, and that subsystem</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; maintainers would simply be told to cope with it. In the absence</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; of such a policy, users will continue to struggle.</font><br>
<p>
I don't think you can "simply tell" maintainers to do anything.<br>
<p>
For drm/i915 we prefer bug reports at <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/</a> because it's much more likely the graphics bugs get reassigned between kernel and userspace components than between kernel components. We cope with <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/">https://bugzilla.kernel.org/</a> by telling people to file the bugs at fdo instead.<br>

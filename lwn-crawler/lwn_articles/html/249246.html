<p>
Loadable kernel modules do not automatically have access to all symbols
(functions and variables) defined in the kernel.  In fact, access is
limited to those symbols which have been explicitly exported for modular
use.  The idea behind this whitelist-like policy is that it helps the
kernel developers to keep the module interface under control, limiting the
ability of modules to dig into parts of the kernel where they are not
welcome.  The practice turns out to be a little more messy: current kernels have over
16,000 <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> declarations sprinkled around the source. 
<p>
Unsurprisingly, there are developers who would like to reduce the number of
exported symbols.  It is often the case that, once a symbol can be shown to
have no users among in-tree modules, it will be removed altogether.  But
there is not universal agreement on just how this process should be
handled; as a result, we see occasional debates on how stable the modular
API should actually be and what provisions should be made for out-of-tree
code.
<p>

Adrian Bunk recently posted <a href="/Articles/249256/">a patch to unexport
<tt>sys_open()</tt> and <tt>sys_read()</tt></a>.  These symbols (which
implement the <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>read()</tt> system calls) have been
on the hit-list for a long time.  It is easy to make catastrophic mistakes
when using them from kernel space, and there is almost no situation where
opening and reading files from within the kernel is considered to be the
right thing to do.  But removing the exports has always proved hard, until
now - there have always been stubborn in-tree users which have kept the
export around.  
<p>
The final holdout in 2.6.23 is the wavefront sound driver which uses
<tt>sys_open()</tt> and <tt>sys_read()</tt> to obtain firmware to load into
the device.  The kernel has had a proper API for dealing with firmware
loads for years, so no driver should be trying to read firmware directly
from files itself.  The current ALSA development tree contains a patch for
the wavefront driver which makes it use the firmware API; once that patch
is merged, there will be no more in-tree users of those symbols.  Adrian,
forever on the lookout for things to remove from the kernel, noticed this
fact and promptly sent in a patch.
<p>

Andrew Morton's <a href="/Articles/249261/">response</a> went like this:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But I think it is better to give people some warning when we're
	planning on breaking out-of-tree things.  I do occasionally receive
	reports of "hey, the X driver which I get from Y doesn't work any
	more".  Often it's open-source stuff, too.  I see no point in
	irritating our users more than we need to.
</div>
<p>
Andrew would like to have the symbols marked with
<tt>EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL()</tt> for one development cycle so that maintainers
of out-of-tree code can get the resulting warning message and fix their
code in response.  It quickly became clear that he is in a minority among
the developers on this issue.  Adrian was particularly upset, complaining
that other developers are allowed to make no-warning changes which break
almost every module in existence while his patch, which affects very few
modules, must go through a special process.  He <a
href="/Articles/249263/">says</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Andrew, please define API rules, IOW rules for addition, removal
	and changing of exported code, that are valid for *everyone* or go
	to hell with your EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL.
</div>
<p>
Christoph Hellwig also responded strongly, leading to <a
href="/Articles/249265/">this amusing (but not for the easily offended)
exchange</a>.  Calmer voices made a few arguments against the warning
period:
<p>
<ul>
<li> These symbols have been on the chopping block for a long time, and
     most out-of-tree module authors should have figured that out by now.
     It is worth noting, though, that the feature removal schedule in the
     kernel documentation says nothing about <tt>sys_open()</tt> and
     <tt>sys_read()</tt>. 
<p>
<li> In this sort of situation warnings are almost entirely ineffective.  Users
     tend not to see them at all, and they do not report them in any case.
     <a href="/Articles/249267/">According to Alan Cox</a>: "<q>Short of
     using their sound card to scream 'Next release you are screwed' they
     won't notice (and if you the sound card trick they'll think they got
     rooted....)</q>"
<p>
<li> Keeping unused symbols around bloats the kernel and increases the load
     on developers who must remember to remove them in a future release.
</ul>
<p>
Andrew does not appear willing to budge on the issue, though.  He <a
href="/Articles/249268/">does not want to unnecessarily upset users</a> who
use out-of-tree modules:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Fact is, people use external modules.  To get their machines
	working correctly, to get their work done, to do stuff they want
	done.
	<p>
	Many of these people are non-programmers.  So when they download a
	new kernel and find that the module which they use doesn't work
	because of something which we've done, they get pissed off, and we
	lose a tester.  This has happened many times.
</div>
<p>
To avoid this problem, he wants exported symbols targeted for removal to
marked with <tt>EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL()</tt> (or
<tt>EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL_GPL()</tt>) for one development cycle.  The
exports should be marked with a comment noting when the export should be
removed altogether.  Each release cycle would include a quick grep to find
the symbols which are now due to be removed for real.  He concludes:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Total cost of this effort: maybe ten developer minutes per release,
	and a few tens of additional bytes in the released vmlinux.
	I think that for a few additional testers and a few less-pissed-off
	users (nothing to do with developers), this cost is justified.
	That's all.
</div>
<p>
Elsewhere he has noted that, if a warning is sufficiently widespread,
somebody, somewhere, will act on it.  One gets the sense that he has not
convinced a whole lot of developers that this position is right.  But
Andrew is in a position to enforce it and most of the others seem to think
that, in the end, it's easier to just go along with what he wants in this
case.  The end result is the same, it just takes a little longer.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I _like_ the idea of giving warning before removing something, so I hope that Morton stands firm on this.  I don't see the harm in it, and frankly, having a clear way to get rid of things is likely to help get things ON the chopping block that need to be there.<br>

      ..and if the counter argument is that people will just ignore it, make the warning require action by the user.  "Warning: module foo uses deprecated functionality, and will break with the next kernel.  Press Enter to continue."  That'll get you bug reports.<br>

      I, too, support the idea of giving warning. When people ignore the warning and then complain, you can say, "I told you this was going to happen X months ago". They're still ticked off, but normal people will shut up and learn to pay more attention to those warnings next time. The result, in the long run, is that fewer people are ticked off when they shouldn't be. In my book, that's a good thing.<br>

      I'd vote for the single-deprecation release approach, too, but for a slightly different reason: if symbols were marked for removal, and a grep listed out all such symbols and got posted somewhere along with the release notes, then when I'm trying to compile a module with version n+8, I have some hope of doing a Google search on the missing symbol and discovering that it was removed in version n+1. I very often encounter problems of this sort, but I can't tell if the symbol is missing because symbol versioning is screwed up again, or because the distribution kernel is too different from the stock kernel, or the module is just borked.<br>

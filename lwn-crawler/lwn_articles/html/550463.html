One of the kernel's core functions is the management of caching; by
maintaining caches at various levels, the kernel is able to improve
performance significantly.  But caches cannot be allowed to grow without
bound or they will eventually consume all of memory.  The kernel's answer
to this problem is the "shrinker" interface, a mechanism by which the
memory management subsystem can request that cached items be discarded and
their memory freed for other uses.  One of the recurring topics at the <a
href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">2013 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory
Management Summit</a> was the need to improve the shrinker interface.  The
<a href="/Articles/550263/">proposed replacement</a> is out for review, so
it seems like time for a closer look.
<p>
<h4>A new shrinker API</h4>
<p>
In current kernels, a cache would implement a shrinker function that
adheres to this interface:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/shrinker.h&gt;

    struct shrink_control {
	gfp_t gfp_mask;
	unsigned long nr_to_scan;
    };

    int (*shrink)(struct shrinker *s, struct shrink_control *sc);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>shrink()</tt> function is packaged up inside a <tt>shrinker</tt>
structure (along with some ancillary information); the whole thing is then
registered with a call to <tt>register_shrinker()</tt>.  
<p>
When memory gets tight, the <tt>shrink()</tt> function will be called from
the memory management subsystem.  The <tt>gfp_mask</tt> will reflect the
type of allocation that was being attempted when the <tt>shrink()</tt> call
was made; the shrinker should avoid any actions that contradict that mask.
So, for example, if a <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> allocation is in progress, a
filesystem shrinker cannot initiate filesystem activity to free memory.
The <tt>nr_to_scan</tt> field tells the shrinker how many objects it should
examine and free if possible; if, however, <tt>nr_to_scan</tt> is zero, the
call is really a 
request to know how many objects currently exist in the cache.
<p>
The use of a single callback function for two purposes (counting objects
and freeing them) irks some developers; it also makes the interface harder
to implement.  So, one of the first steps in the new shrinker patch set is
to redefine the shrinker API to look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    long (*count_objects)(struct shrinker *s, struct shrink_control *sc);
    long (*scan_objects)(struct shrinker *s, struct shrink_control *sc);
</pre>
<p>
The roughly two-dozen shrinker implementations in the kernel have been
updated to use this new API.  
<p>
The current shrinker API is not NUMA-aware.  In an effort to improve that
situation, the <tt>shrink_control</tt> structure has been augmented with
a new field:
<p>
<pre>
    nodemask_t nodes_to_scan;
</pre>
<p>
On NUMA systems, memory pressure is often not a global phenomenon.
Instead, some nodes will have plenty of free memory while others are
running low.  The current shrinker interface will indiscriminately free
memory objects; it pays no attention to which NUMA node any given object is
local to  As a result, it can 
dump a lot of cached data without necessarily helping to address the real
problem.  In the new scheme, shrinkers should observe the
<tt>nodes_to_scan</tt> field and only free memory from the indicated NUMA
nodes. 
<p>
<h4>LRU lists</h4>
<p>
A maintainer of an existing shrinker implementation may well look at the
new NUMA awareness requirement with dismay.  Most shrinker implementations
are buried deep within filesystems and certain drivers; these subsystems do
not normally track their cached items by which NUMA node holds them.  So it
appears that shrinker implementations could get more complicated, but that
turns out not to be the case.
<p>
While looking at the shrinker code, Dave Chinner realized that most
implementations look very much the same: they maintain a
least-recently-used (LRU) list of cached items.  When the shrinker is
called, a pass is made over the list in an attempt to satisfy the request.
Much of that code looked well suited for a generic replacement; that
replacement, in the form of a new type of linked list, is part of the
larger shrinker patch set.
<p>
The resulting "LRU list" data structure encapsulates a lot of the details
of object cache management; it goes well beyond a simple ordered list.
Internally, it is represented by a set of regular <tt>list_head</tt>
structures (one per node), a set of per-node object counts, and per-node
spinlocks to control access.  The inclusion of the spinlock puts the LRU
list at odds with normal kernel conventions: low-level data structures do
not usually include their own locking mechanism, since that locking is
often more efficiently done at a higher level.  In this case, putting the
lock in the data structure allows it to provide per-node locking without
the need for NUMA awareness in higher-level callers.
<p>
The basic API for the management of LRU lists is pretty much as one might
expect:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/list_lru.h&gt;

    int list_lru_init(struct list_lru *lru);
    int list_lru_add(struct list_lru *lru, struct list_head *item);
    int list_lru_del(struct list_lru *lru, struct list_head *item);
</pre>
<p>

A count of the number of items on a list can be had with
<tt>list_lru_count()</tt>.  There is also a mechanism for walking through
an LRU list that is aimed at the needs of shrinker implementations:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long list_lru_walk(struct list_lru	*lru, 
			        list_lru_walk_cb isolate,
				void *cb_arg,
				unsigned long nr_to_walk);
    unsigned long list_lru_walk_nodemask(struct list_lru *lru, 
    	     	  	        list_lru_walk_cb isolate,
				void *cb_arg,
				unsigned long nr_to_walk,
				nodemask_t *nodes_to_walk);
</pre>
<p>
Either function will wander through the list, calling the
<tt>isolate()</tt> callback and, possibly, modifying the list in
response to the callback's return value.  As one would expect,
<tt>list_lru_walk()</tt> will pass through the entire LRU list, while
<tt>list_lru_walk_nodemask()</tt> limits itself to the specified
<tt>nodes_to_walk</tt>.  The callback's prototype looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef enum lru_status (*list_lru_walk_cb)(struct list_head *item, 
    	    	 	    			spinlock_t *lock,
						void *cb_arg);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>item</tt> is an item from the list to be examined, <tt>lock</tt>
is the spinlock controlling access to the list, and <tt>cb_arg</tt> is
specified by the original caller.  The return value can be one of four
possibilities, depending on how the callback deals with the given
<tt>item</tt>:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>LRU_REMOVED</tt> indicates that the callback removed the item from 
     the list; the number of items on the list will be decremented
     accordingly.  In this case, the callback does the actual removal of
     the item.
<p>
<li> <tt>LRU_ROTATE</tt> says that the given item should be moved to the
     ("most recently used") end of the list.  The LRU list code will
     perform the move operation.
<p>
<li> <tt>LRU_RETRY</tt> indicates that the callback should be called again
     with the same item.  A second <tt>LRU_RETRY</tt> return will cause the
     item to be skipped.  A potential use for this return value is if the
     callback notices a potential deadlock situation.
<p>
<li> <tt>LRU_SKIP</tt> causes the item to be passed over with no changes.
</ul>
<p>
With this infrastructure in place, a lot of shrinker implementations come
down to a call to <tt>list_lru_walk_nodemask()</tt> and a callback to
process individual items.
<p>
<h4>Memcg-aware LRU lists</h4>
<p>
While an improved shrinker interface is well worth the effort on its own,
much of the work described above has been driven by an additional need: better
support for memory control groups (memcgs).  In particular, memcg developer
Glauber Costa would like to be able to use the shrinker mechanism to free
only memory that is associated with a given memcg.  All that is needed to
reach this goal is to expand the LRU list concept to include memcg
awareness along with NUMA node awareness.
<p>
The result is a significant reworking of the LRU list API.  What started as
a simple list with some helper functions has now become a two-dimensional
array of lists, indexed by node and memcg ID.  A call to
<tt>list_lru_add()</tt> will now determine which memcg the item belongs to
and put it onto the relevant sublist.  There is a new function —
<tt>list_lru_walk_nodemask_memcg()</tt> — that will walk through an LRU
list, picking out only the elements found on the given node(s) and
belonging to the given memcg.  The more generic functions described above
have been reimplemented as wrappers around the memcg-specific versions.
At this point, the "LRU list" is no longer a
generic data structure (though one could still use it that way); it is,
instead, a core component of the memory management subsystem.
<p>
<h4>Closing notes</h4>
<p>
A review of the current shrinker implementations in the kernel reveals that
not all of them manage simple object caches.  In many cases, what is
happening is that the code in question wanted a way to know when the system
is under memory pressure.  In current kernels, the only way to get that
information is to register a shrinker and see when it gets called.  Such
uses are frowned upon; they end up putting marginally related code into the
memory reclaim path.
<p>
The shrinker patch set seeks to eliminate those users by providing a
different mechanism for code that wants to learn about memory pressure.  It
essentially hooks into the <a href="/Articles/524742/">vmpressure
mechanism</a> to set up an in-kernel notification mechanism, albeit one
that does not use the kernel's usual notifier infrastructure.  Interested
code can call:
<p>
<pre>
    int vmpressure_register_kernel_event(struct cgroup *cg, void (*fn)(void));
</pre>
<p>
The given <tt>fn()</tt> will be called at the same time that pressure
notifications are sent out to user space.  The concept of "pressure levels"
has not been implemented for the kernel-side interface, though.
<p>
Most of this code is relatively new, and it touches a fair amount of core
memory management code.  The latter stages of the patch set, where memcg
awareness is added, could be controversial, but, then, it could be that
developers have resigned themselves to memcg code being invasive and
expensive.  One way or another, most or all of this code will probably find
its way into the mainline; the benefits of the shrinker API improvements
will be nice to have.  But the path to the mainline could be long, and this
patch set has just begun, so it may be a while before it is merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

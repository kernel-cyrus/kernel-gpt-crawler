           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 27, 2022</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, just under 4,600 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository for the 5.19 development cycle.  The 5.19
merge window is clearly well underway.  The changes pulled so far cover a
number of areas, including the core kernel, architecture support, networking,
security, and virtualization; read on for highlights from the first part of
this merge window.
<p>
Interesting changes pulled into the mainline so far include:
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> A number of x86-specific boot options (<tt>nosep</tt>,
     <tt>nosmap</tt>, <tt>nosmep</tt>, <tt>noexec</tt>, and
     <tt>noclflush</tt>) have all been removed.  Each of these disabled a
     CPU feature that it no longer makes sense to disable.
<li> Support for the a.out executable format on x86, which was deprecated
     in the 5.1 release, has now been completely removed.
<li> The x86 <a href="/Articles/790464/">split-lock detection mechanism</a>
     has been made a bit stronger; rather than just warning (by default)
     when a process uses split locks, the kernel will slow that process down
     considerably.  That should preserve the performance of the rest of the
     system and, with luck, cause the offending application to be fixed.
<li> The new Intel "in-field scan" mechanism can run diagnostics and detect
     CPU problems in deployed systems.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/34604d289167">This documentation
     commit</a> has more information.
<li> The xtensa architecture has gained support for a number of features,
     including SMP coprocessors, <a href="/Articles/802128/">KCSAN</a>,
     hibernation, and more.
<li> The m68k architecture now implements a virtual machine based on the
     Android Goldfish emulator.
<li> The Arm <a
     href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/scalable-matrix-extension-armv9-a-architecture">Scalable
     Matrix Extension</a> is now supported (in host mode only, not for guest
     systems). 
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The io_uring subsystem has seen a number of enhancements.  The new
     <tt>IORING_RECVSEND_POLL_FIRST</tt> flag will, when set for networking
     operations, cause an operation to go directly to polling rather than
     attempting a transfer first; this can save some overhead when the
     caller expects the operation to not be able to proceed immediately.
     There are some new flags to ease the management of <a
     href="/Articles/863071/">fixed file descriptors</a>.  The "multi-shot"
     mode for <tt>accept()</tt>  allows multiple connections to
     be accepted in a single operation.  There are new operations to
     manipulate extended attributes on files.  The <tt>socket()</tt> system
     call is now supported.  Finally, there is also now support for
     "passthrough" operations that can send NVMe commands directly to the
     device.
     <p>
     All of these new API features are diligently undocumented. 
<li> It is now possible to store typed pointers in BPF maps; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/367590b7fccc">this merge commit</a>
     has some more information.  This feature should not be confused with
     "dynamic BPF pointers", which will also be in 5.19; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/608b638ebf36">this merge commit</a>
     contains some information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The EROFS read-only filesystem has been significantly reworked to
     use the fscache layer.  This feature can, evidently, significantly
     improve performance on systems running a lot of containers from EROFS
     images.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/65965d9530b0">This
     merge message</a> has a bit more information.  
<li> The EROFS work involved
     adding an "on-demand mode" to fscache, which is documented in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/99302ebd3af7">this commit</a>.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     Aquacomputer Octo temperature sensors and fan controllers,
     Aquacomputer Farbwerk 360 temperature sensors,
     Infineon XDPE152 voltage regulators,
     Microchip LAN9668 temperature sensors, and
     Nuvoton NCT6775F I2C interfaces.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Nvidia SN2201 platform switches,
     Silicon Mitus SM5703 voltage regulators, and
     MediaTek SPI NAND flash interfaces.

<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     Marvell Octeon PCI Endpoint NICs,
     CTU CAN-FD IP cores (see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c3a0addefbde">the documentation</a>),
     Analog Devices Industrial Ethernet T1L PHYs,
     pureLiFi LiFi wireless USB adapters,
     MediaTek PCIe 5G WWAN modem T7xx adapters,
     Texas Instruments DP83TD510 Ethernet 10Base-T1L PHYs,
     Sunplus Dual 10M/100M Ethernet adapters, and
     Realtek 8852CE PCI wireless network (Wi-Fi 6E) adapters.
     <p>
     Also: a number of old networking drivers have been removed (<a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/03fa8fc93e44">commit</a>,
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a5b116a0fa90">commit</a>,
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e05afd0848f8">commit</a>,
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/03dcb90dbf62">commit</a>,
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/01f4685797a5">commit</a>,
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/32c53420d2a0">commit</a>)
     as being unmaintained and, presumably, unused.

<li> Additionally: the power-management subsystem has gained support for devices
     that operate on an "artificial" power scale.  In short, this means
     such a device provides information about the relative efficiency of
     different power states, but that information is not tied to any
     real-world scale.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/015f569c4649">This documentation
     commit</a> contains a little more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/884104/">BIG TCP patch set</a> has been merged;
     this work allows for the sending of huge IPv6/TCP packets on
     data-center networks.
<li> The addition of <a href="/Articles/885729/">packet-drop
     annotations</a> continues, improving an administrator's visibility
     into why network packets are not making it through the system.
<li> The multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol can now fall back to regular TCP in some
     situations where the multipath features cannot be used.
<li> There is also a new user-space API for the management of MPTCP flows.
     Documentation is scarce but there is an introduction in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6a9b3de82516">this merge commit</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Various confidential-computing mechanisms allow secrets to be
     pushed into virtual machines without exposing them to the host system.
     The kernel's EFI subsystem can now expose those secrets to the guest
     via a directory (<tt>security/coco</tt>) under securityfs.  The
     documentation in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cbabf03c3ef3">this commit</a> and
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7419995a331c">this commit</a> gives
     some more information.
<li> The kernel's lockdown mode will prevent even a privileged process from
     changing kernel memory outside of the kernel's control — or, at least,
     that is the intent.  It <a
     href="/ml/oss-security/0A7B7D99-48F7-44B2-9E0A-C18C9EB9E2FA@oracle.com/">turns
     out</a> that lockdown is easily bypassed by simply firing up a kernel
     debugger.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/eadb2f47a3ce">This
     fix</a>, applied to the mainline (and certainly headed toward the
     stable updates), closes the hole.
<li> There have been a number of improvements to the random-number
     generator to improve robustness and performance; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ac2ab99072cc">this merge commit</a>
     contains an overview.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/722293/">structure randomization</a> hardening
     feature is now available with the Clang compiler as of
     version&nbsp;15.
<li> The Landlock security module  now supports rules controlling the
     renaming of files.
<li> The Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) can now use fs-verity
     file digests for verification.
<li> The meaning of "unprivileged BPF" has changed somewhat.  In current
     kernels, disabling unprivileged BPF makes all <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
     system-call commands unavailable.  In 5.19, instead, unprivileged
     processes 
     will have access to commands that do not actually create objects.
     That enables scenarios where a privileged process loads a BPF program,
     then allows an unprivileged process to interact with it.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c272e2591169">This merge commit</a>
     has a little more information.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for AMD's <a
     href="https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf">Secure
     Nested Paging feature</a> has been added.  In short, this feature will
     cause a virtual machine to be notified if its encrypted memory has
     been accessed outside of the machine.  This mechanism can, among other
     things, thwart replay attacks.
<li> Support has also been added for Intel's <a
     href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html">Trusted
     Domain Extensions (TDX)</a> mechanism, which provides some similar
     features.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b9c7ba58777a">this documentation
     commit</a> for some more information.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Objtool, which performs a number of transformations on object files
     as part of the kernel build system, has had its interface completely
     reworked.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/22922deae13f">This
     merge commit</a> gives an overview of the changes, and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a8e35fece49b">this documentation
     commit</a> fills in some of the features the objtool provides.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/893512/">transition to memory folios</a>
     continues; <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fdaf9a5840ac">this
     pull request</a> converted a number of address-space operations over
     to the new(ish) type.
<li> The debugging infrastructure for the SLUB memory allocator has been
     improved; see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9f04b55f003c">this
     documentation commit</a> for more information.
<li> The work to move the printing of kernel messages to per-console
     threads (described in <a href="/Articles/800946/">this 2019
     article</a>) has finally been merged.  This should prevent slow
     consoles from blocking logging or creating large latencies in general.
     Also, the <a href="/Articles/857148/"><tt>printk()</tt> indexing
     feature</a> has now <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a5c7a39f508a">been documented</a>.

</ul>
<p>
The 5.19 merge window is just getting started; it can be expected to remain
open through June&nbsp;5.  Once it closes, LWN will be back with a summary
of what was pulled in the second half; stay tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

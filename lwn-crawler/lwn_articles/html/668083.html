<p>
Backing up files from an encrypted filesystem without having access to the
key is a more complicated process 
than one might think.  For one thing, the directory containing the files
is likely
encrypted as well, so some mechanism to extract an encrypted version of the
file name would be needed.  A recent <a href="/Articles/667767/">patch
set</a> posted to the linux-ext4 
mailing list would provide support for extracting files from an <a
href="/Articles/639427/">encrypted ext4 filesystems</a> for backup or other
purposes. 
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o posted the patches on December&nbsp;10.  They add some
<tt>ioctl()</tt> commands and a mount option to allow administrators to
extract the information needed to store a copy of the file without having a
copy of the encryption key.  It would not, however, allow the restoration
of the file without the key.  According to Ts'o, manipulating both the
encrypted directory and file without the user's key is tricky:
"<q>establishing a link means that we have to manipulate both 
the encrypted directory and the encrypted file, and doing this through
the VFS interface is non-trivial</q>" 
</p>

<p>
There are three chunks of information that need to be stored so that a
file can be restored: the encrypted file data, an encrypted version of the
file name, and the metadata that contains the encryption context
that is stored as an extended attribute (xattr).  Before a
privileged process (i.e. one with <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>) can read the
encrypted file contents, though, the filesystem must be mounted with a
newly added
option (<tt>ciphertext_access</tt>). 

<p>
The
patches allow the encrypted file data to be read using the
<tt>O_DIRECT</tt> mechanism. But there is a snag.  The file size might not be
a multiple of the AES block size (which is used for doing the encryption);
reading the short chunk at the end of such a file is not supported by
<tt>O_DIRECT</tt>, Ts'o said.  Adding a way to do that would require
changes to the 
direct I/O code, which may be controversial.  So instead, a "shadow" copy
of the inode is used with a file size that works and the encrypted file is
padded with zeroes to that size when read.  That is something of a
hack, Ts'o acknowledged.  In addition, the 
original file size will need to be added to the list 
of data that gets stored as
part of the backup (i.e. along with the encrypted file name and the
encryption metadata).
</p>

<p>
For the encryption metadata, two <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands have been added:
<tt>EXT4_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_METADATA</tt> and
<tt>EXT4_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_METADATA</tt>.  As the names imply, they get
and set the metadata needed to decrypt the file and file name when the
user's key is available.  Lastly, the
<tt>EXT4_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTED_FILENAME</tt> command will retrieve the
encrypted file name.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Dilger <a href="/Articles/668154/">asked</a> why <tt>ioctl()</tt>
and <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> were used, rather than virtual xattrs and regular
reads.  If the key is not present, reading the file could simply return
the encrypted contents.  That, coupled with virtual xattrs for the other
needed pieces, would allow existing tools (e.g. <tt>tar&nbsp;--xattrs</tt>)
to back up the files, he said.
</p>

<p>
But Ts'o <a href="/Articles/668155/">pointed out</a> a few problems with
that approach.  The problem with the file size will need to be dealt with
by any tool that is used.  And he is unconvinced that the effort needed to
handle file restoration without the key will be worth it.  Beyond that,
though, his choice of <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> was deliberate: direct I/O does not
use the page cache, so the cache cannot get "poisoned" with pages of
encrypted data.
<div class="BigQuote">
  In our
current design, the page cache for an encrypted file always contains
the plaintext.  This is necessary so that mmap(2) will work correctly.
So if user B is logged onto a machine where user A is active, and user
A's keys are in the kernel, we don't determine access control
[decisions] for user B based on whether or not the user has the
appropriate keyring in a keyring accessible to them.  We use Unix
permissions to provide security isolation between two users which are
logged in.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He continued by noting that user space should drop the plain text pages
from the page cache when user A logs out (and A's keys are removed from the
kernel), but that he doesn't want the integrity of an encrypted backup to
depend on that.  Also, it should still be possible to do an encrypted
backup while A 
is logged in, which can be done when using direct I/O to read the encrypted
data.  In summary, he said that there are enough reasons that regular
backup tools can't be used for this purpose, so "<q>it's simpler all
around to use specific 
ioctls</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara <a href="/Articles/668159/">expressed concern</a> about the shadow
inode "hack".  He thought that it might not be needed, since direct I/O
reads will return any partial block at the end of the file.  In addition,
the locking implications of effectively having two copies of the inode for
a single file were worrisome, he said.  So far, Ts'o has not replied, but
removing the shadow inode, if that turns out to be possible, will only
simplify matters.

<p>
Ts'o also <a href="/Articles/668157/">posted</a> a C program and script
that he has been using to test the changes.  While a mechanism to backup
encrypted files is
certainly needed, the interface proposed feels a little clunky overall,
though there 
may be no real way around that. 
Ts'o also alluded to another
use case that he has for the feature, which he was unable to disclose, that
may partly be guiding the  
interface as well.  Given that he is the ext4 maintainer, though, it seems
likely we will see some kind of change along these lines before long.

Adding security features for reasons that can't be disclosed? Troubling.

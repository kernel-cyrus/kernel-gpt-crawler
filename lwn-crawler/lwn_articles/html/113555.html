Once upon a time, the 2.6 kernel had three software suspend implementations
- two of which were in the mainline - but none which were seen to work all
that well.  Since then, the two mainline implementations have been merged,
and the out-of-tree <a
href="http://softwaresuspend.berlios.de/">swsusp2</a> implementation has
come a long way.  Still, two implementations of a low-level core function
seems like too many, so there is interest in bringing them together in the
mainline.  Swsusp2 developer Nigel Cunningham has made a new effort in that
direction by posting <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/112704/">a set of 51
patches</a> which merge swsusp2 into the 2.6 kernel.
<p>

There is a great deal of code in these patches.  Some of the more
interesting pieces include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A <a href="/Articles/113560/">set of new exported symbols</a>; these
     include fundamental things like <tt>sys_ioctl()</tt>,
     <tt>avenrun</tt>, and a number of low-level swap functions.  These
     exports were poorly received; there is currently a great interest in
     reducing the number of symbols exported to modules.  A patch which,
     instead, exports fundamental interfaces is bound to encounter some
     resistance.
     <p>
     The swsusp2 code wants these symbols exported because the entire
     suspend mechanism can be built as a module and loaded only when the
     system is to be suspended.  This can be a nice feature; swsusp2 is a
     lot of code, and it is all excess baggage anytime the system is
     actually being used.  The costs of making swsusp2 modular may prove
     too high for that feature to be accepted into the mainline, however.
<p>

<li> <a href="/Articles/113565/">A change to the workqueue API</a> allowing
     the creator of a workqueue to specify whether that queue should be
     left running during the suspend process.  Some workqueues perform
     tasks which are needed during the image writeout process, and thus
     cannot be stopped prematurely.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/113572/">A replacement refrigerator</a>, the code
     charged with putting all processes on hold so that the system is in a
     quiet state before suspending.  The intrusive macros which
     characterized the swsusp2 refrigerator some time ago are gone.  The
     new version relies upon a <tt>PF_SYNCTHREAD</tt> task flag to keep
     processes (temporarily) from being frozen while they are doing some
     work involved with writing data to disk.
<p>
<li> A complicated I/O infrastructure for writing the suspend image to
     disk.  The new I/O code is said to be much faster, and it supports
     features like image compression, writing to swap files or LVM devices,
     etc.  Future plans call for more esoteric features, such as suspending
     across a network.  These features may be nice, but it has been <a
     href="/Articles/113575/">pointed out</a> that the swsusp2 I/O code alone
     outweighs the entire mainline software suspend code by a significant
     amount. 
<p>
<li> Various types of "nice displays" when a suspend or resume is in
     progress.  These displays include progress bars, splash screens, and
     more. 
</ul>

<p>
Nigel <a href="/Articles/113579/">offers a number of reasons</a> for
merging swsusp2.  It is claimed to be much faster as a result of the use of
asynchronous I/O, readahead on resume, and (for systems with slow drives)
image compression.  It is far more configurable; users can select the sort
of display they like, image compression and/or encryption, etc.  Suspending
to swap files, LVM devices, and more is supported.  And so on.  There is
little disagreement that swsusp2 offers some nice features, but there is
some concern over how Nigel is trying to proceed:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm thus seeking to simply merge the existing code, let Pavel and
	others get to the point where they're ready to say "Okay, we're
	satisfied that suspend2 does everything swsusp does and more and
	better." Then we can remove swsusp.
</div>
<p>

The kernel developers are increasingly resistant to wholesale merging of
large blocks of code - especially when that code duplicates functionality
already found in the kernel.  They would rather see a series of incremental
patches, each of which takes a small, useful step in the right direction.
Nigel does not want to do that; swsusp2 is vastly different, internally,
than the mainline suspend code, and evolving one into the other looks like
a long, painful, and pointless job.  He may have to do that work, however,
before any of the swsusp2 code can be merged.
<p>

A bigger obstacle, however, may be the fact that, while swsusp2 was being
developed, the mainline software suspend code was progressing too.  Your
editor is able to reliably suspend to memory and disk with a vanilla 2.6.9
kernel.  SUSE enables software suspend and <a
href="http://www.novell.com/products/linuxprofessional/features/new.html">calls
it a feature</a> in its 9.2 release.  Since the in-kernel suspend code
seems to actually work, enthusiasm for replacing it with a larger, more
complex version is not as high as it might otherwise have been.  The
ultimate fate of swsusp2 may yet be to contribute its best improvements to
the mainline, but to never be merged in its entirety..<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm still waiting for software suspend that<br>
actually works on SMP (and <br>
amd64 smp at that).  I've been told swsusp2 does, but haven't wished to go <br>
adding a patch set like that to my otherwise basically vanilla kernel.  <br>
Thus, I'm really interested in seeing swsusp2 merged. <br>
 <br>
Presently, I can disable ACPI and use APM hardware suspend (to ram), and <br>
that's what I've been doing lately.  The problem there is things like ntpd <br>
which don't know they are suspended.  I end up having to stop ntpd, then <br>
restart ntp-client and ntpd after awakening.  It'd sure be nice to have <br>
all that handled automatically, with acpi enabled. <br>
 <br>
The other possibility, of course, is that of using the evolving CPU <br>
hotplug technology to handle both suspend, and CPU speed throttling (which <br>
also doesn't work on smp) as well.  The idea, once CPU hotplugging is <br>
sufficiently mature, would be to use its process migration features to <br>
turn off one CPU at a time until only the primary CPU remains, at which <br>
point the system could treat it like a single CPU system and trottle or <br>
suspend it accordingly.  Of course, in addition to the other complexities <br>
of such a solution, consider NUMA architectures and the entirely possible <br>
scenario where the memory accessible to a single CPU won't hold the entire <br>
running system.  We then end up having to swap what won't fit to <br>
disk, /then/ do the throttling or suspending of what remains.  If it's not <br>
handled carefully, that's begging for a swap storm and some unfortunately <br>
long time-to-single-cpu while headed to throttling mode or suspend.  For <br>
suspend that might be acceptable, but if it takes 30 seconds to turn on or <br>
off the second CPU on the way to what's supposed to be transparent <br>
throttling mode, it's not going to be acceptable.   <br>
 <br>
Anyway, mature CPU hotplugging seems to be some time off in the first <br>
place, and beyond that it'd have to be adopted for this, so swsusp2 would <br>
appear to be a quicker solution.  I'd love to have it in the kernel to <br>
play with, particularly if it DOES handle multiple CPUs. <br>
 <br>
BTW, anyone know how multi-core CPUs will be handled in this regard?  One <br>
would /think/ the hardware at least would be able to handle that without <br>
the race conditions in the multi-socket solution.  Will the kernel and <br>
necessary userspace handle it as well, or will it see it as two physically <br>
separate CPUs and refuse to handle them with "conventional" throttling and <br>
suspend mechanisms? <br>

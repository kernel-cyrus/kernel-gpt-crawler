<h1>The Ottawa Kernel Summit, Day One</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
The first day of the Linux Kernel Developers' Summit has just finished in
Ottawa.  Almost 80 kernel hackers have gathered here to discuss issues that
must be resolved in the 2.5 development series.  This article covers the
discussion from the first day of the summit.
<p>

<h2>Hammer port</h2>

This talk was mostly a status report on the AMD Hammer (x86-64) port.  AMD,
as one of the sponsors of the kernel summit, was given a slot of time to
talk about this architecture and what has been done to make Linux work with
this processor.
<p>
Hammer is the extension of the old x86 architecture to 64 bits.  It has
been done in the most simple way possible; only two new instructions have
been added.  It is meant to be an easy path to 64-bit computing.
<p>
Numerous details of the Hammer port were presented.  Some of the more
interesting ones:
<ul>
<li> The stack remains two pages long, despite the fact that 64-bit code
     requires more stack space (more data space in general, really).  To
     make this work, a separate, 16KB interrupt stack has been created for
     each IRQ line.
<p>
<li> Certain system calls (i.e. <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>) have been
     implemented with "vsyscalls."  They run in user space, but live in a
     special memory region at the end of user space.
<p>
<li> Hammer uses a four-level page table.  The Linux kernel only uses three 
     levels, so the port authors made the fourth level global, shared by
     all processes.  The page size remains 4KB (any other size presents
     application compatibility problems).  The current virtual address
     space is 512GB, which is "enough for now."  Processes running in
     32-bit mode have a 3.5GB address space.  A 512GB segment has been set
     aside just for kernel memory obtained with <tt>vmalloc</tt>.  The
     kernel is also able to map all memory directly into kernel space, so
     there is no "high memory" on this architecture.
</ul>
<p>
Overall, this port looks like a nice way to run Linux - your author wishes
he had one of these systems.


<h2>Kernel parameters</h2>

"Kernel parameters" are just ways of controlling how the kernel operates.
Typically, they can be specified at boot time (on the command line), at
module load time, or at run time through <tt>/proc</tt>, a system call, or
some other interface.  Each way of handling parameters requires a different
bit of code, so many kernel subsystems do not implement all the different
ways of setting parameters.  This session looked at two different
approaches for unifying the handling of kernel parameters.
<p>
Rusty Russell presented his scheme for handling kernel parameters.  It
involves replacing the <tt>MODULE_PARM</tt> macro with a new <tt>PARAM</tt>
macro which would set up a parameter for the boot command line, module
insertion, and <tt>/proc</tt>.  Unlike <tt>MODULE_PARM</tt>, the new scheme
is type safe (i.e. the compiler catches type errors).  
It is also based on a callback mechanism which makes it easy
for a module to define new parameter types if need be.
<p>
The other approach was presented by Patrick Mochel.  As part of his ongoing
driver model work, he implemented "driverfs," the driver filesystem.
driverfs is a virtual filesystem initially developed as a debugging tool;
it is a convenient way of looking at the structure of the device tree.  The
facilities provided by driverfs are similar to those provided by Rusty's
scheme; driverfs, too, is type-safe and easy to set up.  It is also, for
now, limited to device drivers only; the question is whether it should be
expanded to handle kernel parameters in general.
<p>
While no conclusions were drawn in the session, driverfs looks (to your
author) like it is here to stay, since it so nicely incorporates the
system's structure in the filesystem it creates.  It just needs to be
expanded to cover all of the other types of parameters in the system
(i.e. VM, networking, etc.) that are not directly associated with devices. 
A merger with some variant Rusty's scheme would help in that regard, and
seems likely at some point.
<p>
Linus pointed out that he would like to see a single, integrated filesystem
that includes all such information.  Thus, for example, the "fsfs" that
provides filesystem information can include links to the underlying devices
holding those filesystems.  Module information can link to the associated
driver and devices.  Such a filesystem, he said, makes the linkages in the
system visible and explicit.
<p>
Eventually, <tt>/proc</tt> could be phased out in favor of a driverfs-like
system, with a "one file, one value" rule.  This change really has to begin
in 2.5, since <tt>/proc</tt> has to be supported for at least one more
stable kernel cycle.  Expect to see more activity in this area in the near
future. 


<h2>Living with modules</h2>

The session on "living with modules" was presented by Rusty Russell "and the
angry ghost of Keith Owens."  Rusty started with the claim that the only
purpose for modules was adding hardware that you didn't have when you
booted your kernel.  Given that, he would not be entirely ill at ease with
the removal of loadable modules entirely.  But that, of course, is not to
be. 
<p>
There are, according to Rusty, three classes of problems with loadable
modules:
<ul>
<li> implementation problems
<li> initialization problems
<li> removal problems
</ul>
<p>
The implementation problems are mostly poor interfaces and badly done
subsystems - stuff that can be fixed.  Rusty singled out the
<tt>inter_module</tt> calls as being especially poorly done and impossible
to use correctly (thus making Keith's ghost even angrier).  
<p>
Module linking could also be improved: Rusty set out to do that by moving
the linking code from the <tt>insmod</tt> program to the kernel itself.
The result: the amount of kernel code actually dropped.  Many things get
easier, it seems, when you don't have to deal with the differences between
the kernel and user space environments.  As an added bonus, he implemented
the discarding of initialization code - something that has never quite been
done for loadable modules.
<p>
One thing Rusty did not yet implement was modversions (matching of data
structures to allow binary modules to be loaded into more than one kernel
version).  Linus asked if anybody would be truly unhappy if modversions
went away forever.  There were few complaints: modversions is ugly, and
kernel developers rarely use it.  Alan Cox and the rest of the Red Hat
crowd did complain, though, saying that customer support would be a
nightmare if the kernel did not support modversions.  The real-world need
for modversions is probably strong enough that the feature will not go
away.
<p>
Moving on, Rusty got into module initialization problems.  There are a few
classes of these:
<ul>
<li> Most initialization code assumes that it is being run at boot time, 
     when there are no user processes running yet.  So, for example, it is
     common to see a module set up a <tt>/proc</tt> interface before it is
     ready, internally, to handle accesses to that interface.  This sort of
     race condition almost never hurts users, but it does exist.
<p>
<li> Error checking in module initialization code is often inadequate.  
     Poor interfaces can be blamed for part of this.
<p>
<li> Recovering from errors at initialization time is almost impossible. 
     Imagine a driver which creates two files in <tt>/proc</tt>.  If
     something goes wrong between the creation of those two files, the
     first one must be removed.  But the possibility exists that some user
     process has already opened the first file.  There is no safe action at
     that point.
</ul>
<p>
There are a couple of possible solutions to the initialization issues.  The
first is to split every kernel registration interface into two phases:
"reserve" and "use."  The reserve functions would allocate the needed
resources to the module, but would not make any interfaces available to the
kernel or to user space.  When all of the reservations have succceeded, the
module can call the "use" functions (which will not fail) to safely make
resources available to the rest of the system.
<p>
The alternative is to add a module pointer to every registration
interface.  Any use of the registered resource would then increment the
reference count on the module, preventing its premature removal.  Even if
the module initialization fails, the module will not be unloaded until the
reference count drops to zero.  These changes, along with an audit of the
initialization code in every module, would make module loading safe.
<p>
Module removal is a more difficult problem.  Some of the issues here
include:
<ul>
<li> There is no way to force the removal of a module.  Some modules,
     in fact, are not removable at all.
<p>
<li> The module removal operation itself can not return a failure status,
     since its return value is void.
<p>
<li> The biggest issue is the raft of race conditions that go along with 
     module removal.  It is <i>hard</i> to know when it is truly safe to
     remove a module from the system.
</ul>
<p>
There are a few ways of dealing with the removal problems.  One would be to
add locking and reference counts to absolutely every operation that can
involve a module.  Everything which tries to increment a module reference
count must check the status of the operation and not use the module if the
increment fails (which can happen if the module is being deleted).  The
change is invasive, and the performance overhead of all that reference
counting could be significant.
<p>
The second option is a two-stage module removal process.  The first stage
("cleanup") removes all interfaces to the module, guaranteeing that the
module reference count will not increase.  The cleanup step can fail, in
which case the module will not be unloaded.  Assuming a successful cleanup,
the "destroy" phase actually removes the module from the system once it's
safe to do so.
<p>
"Once it's safe" is still not an easy thing to know, however.  The kernel
must wait until the reference count on the module drops to zero, of
course.  But, at the minimum, there is still a race condition here: the
module must execute, at least, a "return" instruction after decrementing
its reference count.  It is conceivable that the kernel could remove the
module before the return is executed, with unpredictable results.
<p>
To get around this problem, the original cleanup/destroy patch waited for
every processor on the system to schedule once; that would guarantee that
no processor is still executing with the doomed module's code.  At least,
that worked until the preemptible kernel patch was merged.  With a
preemptible kernel, the only way to be truly safe is to wait until every
process on the system has yielded the processor once.  
<p>
There are advantages to this system: it can be made to work safely, it is
possible to force the unload of a module, and each module can handle its
own reference counting.  It is complex, however.
<p>
The third approach is simpler: simply deprecate module removal.  It would
remain as an optional feature (it is, after all, most useful for debugging
kernel code), but, by default, module loading would be forever.  In the
end, says Rusty, kernel modules do not take that much space and memory is
cheap; module removal may be an optimization that we no longer need.  There
are some residual issues, such as old PCMCIA drivers that do not properly
clean up after themselves if they are not removed, but as a whole this
option is easy and makes a lot of code go away.  There seemed to be a lot
of sympathy for this approach in the room.  No decisions were made,
however.


<h2>Virtual memory</h2>

The VM session featured Rik van Riel and Andrea Arcangeli; it was moderated
by Daniel Phillips.  One might have expected this to be a contentious
session, given the disagreements that have come up over the years, but it
turned out not to be that way.  Linux VM, it seems, may actually be
approaching a relatively mature state.
<p>
The first topic of discussion was Rik van Riel's reverse mapping VM patch 
(see <a href="/2002/0124/kernel.php3">the January&nbsp;24 LWN Kernel
Page</a>).  Rik approached it as a controversial subject, pointing out its
advantages but prepared for a discussion on whether, in the end, rmap
justified the overhead it imposes.  Andrea expressed concern over the extra
costs (especially in the <tt>fork()</tt> system call), but agreed that rmap
was needed in a number of situations.
<p>
Linus cut much of the discussion short, however, by stating that rmap was
almost certain to go into 2.5 at some point.  He is more concerned with
getting a set of small patches that he can merge into the kernel so that
the remaining issues can be addressed.  So there wasn't much point in
talking further about rmap's advantages and disadvantages.
<p>
The issues of accounting and out-of-memory handling remain.  Interestingly,
it is 
hard for the kernel to know when it is really out of memory; it is hard to
keep a handle on how many pages could be freed now if they were needed.  So
heuristics must be used, and a balance must be found.  If an "out of
memory" situation is declared too soon, processes can be killed
unnecessarily.  If you wait too long, the system can deadlock.  Andrea's
current code errs on the side of killing processes, rather than risk
deadlocks. 
<p>
An interesting source of VM problems is kmap entries.  32-bit systems with
large amounts of memory must set aside most of the memory as "high memory,"
which has no direct mapping from kernel space.  Before any kernel code can
access high memory, it must temporarily map it into kernel space via a kmap
entry.  It turns out that there can be demands for large numbers of kmap
entries, exhausting the pool of page table entries set aside for kmaps.
Additionally,
the kmap pool is protected by a spinlock; on large systems, contention for
this spinlock can be a real performance drag.
<p>
The solution appears to be creating per-process pools of kmap entries.
This implementation would scale the number of entries along with the number
of processes, and would eliminate the contention for the global lock.  Look
for an implementation from Andrea before too long.
<p>
Other issues that were discussed briefly include:
<ul>
<li> NUMA systems, which are increasing in importance.  
<p>
<li> Soft page size - making pages larger through clustering, at least in
     some memory zones.  Larger pages can reduce system overhead, but can
     bring internal fragmentation and system complexity.
<p>
<li> Very large physical pages on architectures that support them.
<p>
<li> Swap clustering - swapping adjacent memory pages to consecutive
     blocks on the disk.  Reverse mapping will make clustering harder,
     since it looks at physical memory rather than virtual memory areas.
     Rik thinks that this problem can be worked around, however.
<p>
<li> Better reclamation of system data structures.  For example, the 
     kernel trims down the directory entry (dentry) cache when memory is
     tight, but dentries are released via a least-recently-used queue.  If,
     instead, the system freed all dentries on a given page, it could free
     the page more easily.
</ul>
The overall picture of Linux VM is that there remains much work to do, but
that the basic mechanism is in relatively good shape.  Given that people
have been complaining about VM in Linux for years, this is a most positive
development.  


<h2>Block I/O</h2>

Jens Axboe led a session on the block I/O subsystem which, of course, has
been massively reworked in the 2.5 series.  His talk concentrated on the
issues that remain to be resolved.
<p>
One of those issues is ordered writes and barriers.  Journaling filesystems
need, at times, to be sure that certain operations have completed before
others can be started.  Without write barriers, the transactional nature of
the filesystem is lost.  The infrastructure for write barriers is there
now; what remains is to push the implementation down into the block
drivers.  For IDE drives, this will be done with cache flushes before and
after the barrier.  For SCSI drives, ordered tags can be used.  That
requires, however, that the SCSI layer use the generic tag code which has
been implemented in the block layer; that work is in progress.
<p>
Multipage I/O still raises issues.  Many I/O operations generated by the
system are large; it is vastly preferable to keep them together so that
they can be handled efficiently by the hardware.  The problem is that,
sometimes, the hardware can not handle large requests.  Hardware
limitations can come into play, or the block device could be a virtual
device (a RAID or LVM device) which must split the request anyway.
<p>
One way of handling this problem is to split requests that turn out to be
too large.  But splitting is an ugly and inefficient process; it is best
avoided.  A better approach would be to involve the device driver in the
construction of block I/O requests; a new interface would allow the
requests to be built, page by page, with the driver telling the block layer
when the request gets too large. 
<p>
Even then, though, it seems that splitting may be necessary in some
situations.  The remaining cases could probably be solved in a simple way,
however; the offending request could just be resubmitted one sector at a
time.  This solution is slow, but it shouldn't be needed that often.
<p>
Unlike the rest of the block I/O subsystem, 
I/O scheduling remains essentially unchanged since 2.4.  The current
elevator code works well in most situations, but one can always try to do
better.  Jens has been experimenting
with a variation of the scheduler which would enforce an upper bound on the 
latency for any given request.  The modified elevator can guarantee that
any request will be executed within one second, with a 3% performance
penalty.  Lowering the deadline to 100ms raises the performance hit to 8%.
Most people seemed to think that this penalty was acceptible.  Future work
could include prioritizing requests and "anticipatory scheduling" -
delaying read requests slightly in the hope that they can be clustered with
other requests.
<p>
Finally, the task of removing buffer heads from the block I/O subsystem
continues.

<h2>Tomorrow's sessions</h2>

The second day will include sessions on database performance, the HP kernel
wishlist (presented by Bdale Garbee), the Loadable Security Module,
asynchronous I/O, SCSI, and the overall goals for 2.6 and "improving the
release engineering process."  Stay tuned for our coverage of these
discussions.

      This is why I having been reading LWN's kernel news for years! The kernel articles are always concise and intelligent, but still include plenty of juicy technical information. Good job. I don't have the time or patience to wade through the linux-kernel mailing list, but I love to read about the design decisions (and arguments ;-) of the Linux kernel developers.<br>

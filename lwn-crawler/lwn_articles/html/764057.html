It is common for kernel code to generate unique integers for identifiers.
When one plugs in a flash drive, it will show up as
<tt>/dev/sdN</tt>; that <tt>N</tt> (a letter derived from a
number) must be generated in the
kernel, and it should not already be in use for another drive or unpleasant
things will happen.  One might think that generating such numbers would not
be a difficult task, but that turns out not to be the case, especially in
situations where many numbers must be tracked.  The IDA (for "ID
allocator", perhaps) API exists to handle this specialized task.  In past
kernels, it has managed to make the process of getting an unused number
surprisingly 
complex; the 4.19 kernel has a new IDA API that simplifies things
considerably.
<p>
Why would the management of unique integer IDs be complex?  It comes down
to the usual problems of scalability and concurrency.  The IDA code must be
able to track potentially large numbers of identifiers in an efficient way;
in particular, it must be able to find a free identifier within a given
range quickly.  In practice, that means using a <a
href="/Articles/175432/">radix tree</a> (or, soon, an <a
href="/Articles/745073/">XArray</a>) to track allocations.  Managing such a
data structure requires allocating memory, which may be difficult to do in
the context where the ID is required.  Concurrency must also be managed, in
that two threads allocating or freeing IDs in the same space should not
step on each other's toes.
<p>
A particular allocation space (usually just called an "IDA") is created
with either of the usual kernel idioms.  It can be defined and initialized
with this macro:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/idr.h&gt;

    DEFINE_IDA(name);
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, the two steps can be separated with:
<p>
<pre>
    struct ida my_ida;
    /* ... */
    ida_init(&amp;my_ida);
</pre>
<p>
If an IDA is no longer needed, it can be freed by passing it to
<tt>ida_destroy()</tt>; it is not necessary to free any allocated IDs
first.
<p>

<h4>The old way</h4>
<p>
A longtime unwritten design pattern in the kernel community states that
low-level utilities (such as IDA) should not perform their own locking;
instead, protection against concurrent calls should be handled by the
caller.  The reasoning is that, often as not, the higher-level code has its
own locking already; in such cases, doing more locking at a lower level would be
wasteful.  So the old IDA API expected (with an exception, see below) that
locking would be handled by its callers.
<p>
That raises another issue, though.  IDA is supposed to be fast, but the
effort past kernel developers have put into squeezing out that last
microsecond of execution time would go to waste if IDA calls were
surrounded by heavyweight locking.  IDA callers thus tend to use spinlocks;
that choice may be forced by the context in which ID allocation is
performed anyway.  The use of spinlocks means that IDA allocation tends
to be done in
atomic context, where memory allocation can be less reliable.  To deal with
this problem, pre-4.19 IDA allocation is split into two phases.  First, a
call is made to:
<p>
<pre>
    int ida_pre_get(struct ida *ida, gfp_t gfp);
</pre>
<p>
This function tries to ensure that memory will be available to satisfy a
subsequent allocation request, which is done using:
<p>
<pre>
    int ida_get_new_above(struct ida *ida, int start, int *id);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>ida_pre_get()</tt> call can be done outside of the locking that
serializes calls to <tt>ida_get_new_above()</tt>, so it may be more likely
to succeed in allocating memory.  Of course, there is no guarantee that the
memory pre-allocated by one caller will not be snagged by a concurrent
caller, so <tt>ida_get_new_above()</tt> can still return <tt>-EAGAIN</tt>.
Thus, ID allocation is typically performed with a dance like:
<p>
<pre>
    retry:
        ida_pre_get(&amp;some_ida, GFP_KERNEL);
	spin_lock(&amp;some_lock);
	r = ida_get_new_above(&amp;some_ida, 0, &amp;id);
	spin_unlock(&amp;some_lock);
	if (r == -EAGAIN)
	    goto retry;
</pre>
<p>
An identifier allocated this way could be freed with <tt>ida_remove()</tt>,
which must also be called with the appropriate lock held.
<p>
This kind of pattern makes a simple task start to look a bit less simple,
especially if the spinlock must be introduced for the sole purpose of
calling IDA functions.
It is also the sort of code that can be easy to get wrong in subtle ways.
In the hopes of making life easier, a set of higher-level functions was
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/88eca0207cf1574328c3ce8c3be537a9317261bb">added
by Rusty Russell</a> in 2011 for the 3.1 kernel release:
<p>
<pre>
    int ida_simple_get(struct ida *ida, unsigned int start, unsigned int end,
		       gfp_t gfp_mask);
    void ida_simple_remove(struct ida *ida, unsigned int id);
</pre>
<p>
These functions use their own lock and hide the <tt>ida_pre_get()</tt>
dance from callers.  As of 4.18, most IDA users use these functions, but
there are still numerous sites using the more complex API.
<p>
<h4>The 4.19 way</h4>
<p>
One of the last pulls into the mainline before the release of 4.19-rc1 was
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180621212835.5636-1-willy%40infradead.org/">Matthew
Wilcox's IDA series</a>, which makes a number of changes to the API.  In 
particular, <tt>ida_pre_get()</tt> no longer exists as far as IDA users are
concerned; all IDA functions now handle their own internal locking and
memory allocation.  Allocation and freeing of identifiers is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    int ida_alloc(struct ida *ida, gfp_t gfp);
    void ida_free(struct ida *, unsigned int id);
</pre>
<p>
There are a number of variants for callers needing more control over the
allocated ID:
<p>
<pre>
    int ida_alloc_min(struct ida *ida, unsigned int min, gfp_t gfp);
    int ida_alloc_max(struct ida *ida, unsigned int max, gfp_t gfp);
    int ida_alloc_range(struct ida *ida, unsigned int min, unsigned int max,
			gfp_t gfp);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>ida_simple_get()</tt> and <tt>ida_simple_remove()</tt> still exist as
wrappers around the above functions, avoiding the need to change large
numbers of existing callers, but those functions should probably be seen as
deprecated at this point.  The lower-level functions have been removed
entirely, instead, and all callers within the kernel have been changed to
the new API.
<p>
The IDA interface has clearly been simplified quite a bit.  The underlying
implementation remains surprisingly complex for such a seemingly simple
task, though; interested readers can find it in <a

Thanks for writing up about a third of my talk at LCA for next year, Jon ;-)<br>
<p>
The IDA used to be even worse than your write-up makes it sound.  Before 2017, any part of the kernel which ever allocated from an IDA had to call ida_destroy() before the IDA went out of scope, or it would leak at least a 128-byte allocation, and probably seven 1200-byte allocations.  Oh, and for most of the lifetime of the IDA, it would tie up that allocated memory even though it wasn't used.<br>
<p>
When I noticed this problem, my first instinct was to add ida_destroy() calls all over the kernel, then I realised that was foolish and I needed to fix the bad design.  I'm nearly done :-)<br>
<p>
I suspect most of the ida_destroy() calls in the kernel are now unnecessary.  Most callers free each allocation individually, then call ida_destroy() at the end just because nobody's put in the effort to check it's now unneeded.  I may put in an option to warn if ida_destroy() is called on an empty IDA, but that isn't going to prove the IDA is _always_ empty at that point.<br>
<p>
There's more I can say ... but I'll save it for Christchurch!<br>

Would be really nice to replace these with something like ida_assert_empty(), to catch leaks. Sure we have kmemleak, but it's slow, and often fairly late at spotting the leak.<br>

In fact, the drives will be enumerated by letters, not numbers (when using /dev/sd*). So if you plug in a flash drive it will show up as, for example, <i>/dev/sdb</i> and the first partition would be <i>/dev/sdb1</i>

That's correct, but the SCSI code does in fact use an IDA for generating a number.  That number is displayed as a letter (a-z, aa-zz, aaa-zzz) ie a base-10 to base-26 conversion.<br>

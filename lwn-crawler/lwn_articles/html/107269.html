<h1>Realtime preemption, part 2</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 20, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
In <a href="/Articles/105571/">last week's episode</a>, we saw the release
of a number of patches intended to bring (something closer to) realtime
response to the standard Linux kernel.  The level of activity in this area
remains high; here is what has been happening over the last week.
<p>

Bill Huey of LynuxWorks <a href="/Articles/107270/">surfaced</a> to
announce that he, too, has been working on realtime preemption; his patches
are available at <a
href="http://mmlinux.sourceforge.net">mmlinux.sourceforge.net</a>.
Mr. Huey seemed a bit annoyed at the posting from MontaVista which started
the current discussion; his version, it seems, has been working for some
months.  But, <a href="/Articles/107272/">by his own admission</a>, he had
been sitting on the patches for some time as a result of the "commercial
development attitude" at his employer.  "Release early" is the kernel
developers' mantra for a reason.
<p>

The mmlinux patch resembles the others, in that it turns all spinlocks into
semaphores and makes most critical sections preemptible.  It includes a
threaded interrupt handler patch from TimeSys, and uses standard Linux
semaphores, without priority inheritance.  See <a
href="/Articles/106566/">the mmlinux release announcement</a> for more
information. 
<p>

The folks at MontaVista must be feeling a bit like their own vehicle has
taken off and left them behind.  Even so, Daniel Walker <a
href="/Articles/106975/">announced</a> a new MontaVista realtime patch,
based on Ingo Molnar's work.  It includes an architecture-independent mutex
implementation (but still different from regular Linux kernel semaphores),
and some latency tracing code.
<p>

The real work, however, continues to be done by Ingo Molnar; he has been
releasing patches at such a rate that some
developers working on slower systems may have trouble simply compiling them
 before the next one comes out.  Ingo's focus has been the
elimination of the (numerous) remaining spinlocks, especially those outside
of the core kernel.  The current situation, as he put it, is "<q>an
opt-in model to correctness which is bad from a maintenance and upstream
acceptance point of view</q>".  With his current patches (the latest is
<a href="/Articles/107230/">RT-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U8</a> as of this writing, but
that is likely to have changed by the time anybody reads this), over 90% of
the raw spinlock calls have been removed, and most non-core subsystems are
entirely free of spinlocks.  At least, that is the case when realtime
preemption is configured into the kernel; without that option, the
situation is mostly unchanged.
<p>

To get to that point, Ingo had to make changes to a number of Linux mutual
exclusion primitives which got in the way.  One of those is per-CPU
variables, which are based around the idea that, as long as each processor
only works with its own copy of a variable, no locking is required to make
that work safe.  That assumption only holds, however, if threads are not
preempted while manipulating per-CPU variables.  So using a per-CPU
variable requires disabling preemption, which runs counter to the whole
"make everything preemptible" idea.  To address this problem, Ingo
introduced a new "locked" per-CPU variable type:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_PER_CPU_LOCKED(type, name);

    get_cpu_var_locked(var, cpu);
    put_cpu_var_locked(var, cpu);
</pre>
<p>

Threads which use the "locked" type of per-CPU variable can be preempted
while working with that variable - they can even be shifted to a different
processor while sleeping.  The result could be a thread updating the
"wrong" processor's version of the variable.  The lock will prevent race
conditions, however, so, <a href="/Articles/106567/">as Ingo puts it</a>,
"<q>'statistically' the 
variable is still per-CPU and update correctness is fully
preserved.</q>"

<p>
Then, there is the issue of read-copy-update, which also depends on
threads not being preempted while they hold a reference to RCU-protected
data.  Ingo's approach here was, essentially, to dump RCU in the realtime
case and just go back to regular locking.  This change is hard to do in any
sort of automatic way, however, because the RCU read locking primitive
(<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt>, which, normally, just disables preemption) does
not identify which data is being protected.  So converting RCU code
requires picking out a spinlock or semaphore which can be used to prevent
races with writers, and to change the <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> calls to one
of the many new variants:
<p>
<pre>
    rcu_read_lock_sem(struct semaphore *sem);
    rcu_read_lock_down_read(struct rwsem *sem);
    rcu_read_lock_spin(spinlock_t *lock);
    ...
</pre>
<p>
This API, Ingo notes, is still in flux.  There does not seem to have been
any benchmarking done yet to determine what effect these changes have on the
scalability issues RCU was created to address.

<p>
Atomic kmaps were another problem.  An atomic kmap is a mechanism used to
quickly map a high memory page into the kernel's address space.  It is, for
all practical purposes, an implementation of per-CPU page table entries,
and it has the same preemption issues.  The solution here was the addition
of a new function (<tt>kmap_atomic_rt()</tt>) which turns into a regular,
non-atomic kmap when realtime preemption is enabled.  In this case (as with
many of the others) the low-latency imperative brings a small overall
performance cost.
<p>

As a sort of side project, many users of semaphores in the kernel were
changed over to the <a href="/Articles/23993/">completion</a> mechanism.
Some new completion functions have been added to help with that process:
<p>
<pre>
    int wait_for_completion_interruptible(struct completion *c);
    unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout(struct completion *c,
                                              unsigned long timeout);
    unsigned long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(struct completion *c,
                                              unsigned long timeout);
</pre>
<p>

Quite a few other changes have gone in, but the idea should be clear by
now: a vast number of changes are being made to the kernel's fundamental
assumptions about locking and the execution environment.  Few readers will
be surprised to learn that the brave souls testing these patches have been
encountering significant numbers of bugs.  Those bugs are being squashed in
a hurry, though, to the point that Ingo can <a
href="/Articles/106567/">say</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	...this is i believe the first correct conversion of the Linux kernel
	to a fully preemptible (fully mutex-based) preemption model, while
	still keeping all locking properties of Linux.
	<p>
	I also think that this feature can and should be integrated into
	the upstream kernel sometime in the future. It will need
	improvements and fixes and lots of testing, but i believe the basic
	concept is sound and inclusion is manageable and desirable.
</div>
<p>

The interesting thing is that nobody has come forward to challenge that
statement.  As the realtime preemption patches become more stable, and the
pressure for their inclusion starts to build, that situation may well
change.  It is hard to imagine a patch this intrusive going in without some
sort of fight - especially when many developers are far from convinced
about the goal of supporting realtime applications in Linux to begin with.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

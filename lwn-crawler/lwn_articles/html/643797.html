<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 13, 2015</br>
           </div>
The memory-management units built into most contemporary processors are
able to control access to memory on a per-page basis.  Operating systems
like Linux make that control available to applications in user space; the
protection bits supplied to system calls like <tt>mmap()</tt> and
<tt>mprotect()</tt> allow a process to say whether any given page should be
readable, writable, or executable.  This level of protection has served for
a long time, so one might be tempted to conclude that it provides
everything that applications need.  But a new hardware feature under
development at Intel suggests otherwise; the first round of patches to
support this feature explore how programs might gain access to this
feature.
<p>
This feature is called "memory protection keys" (MPK); it will only be available
in future 64-bit Intel processors.  When this feature is enabled, four
(previously unused) bits in each page-table entry can be used to assign one
of sixteen "key" values to any given page.  There is also a new 32-bit
processor register with two bits for each key value.  Setting the "write
disable" bit for a given key will block all attempts to write a page with
that key value; setting the "access disable" bit will block reads as well.
The MPK feature thus allows a process to partition its memory into a
maximum of sixteen regions and to selectively disable or enable access to
any of those regions.  The control register is local to each thread, so
different threads can enable or disable different regions
independently. 
<p>
A <a href="/Articles/643617/">patch set</a> enabling the MPK feature has
been posted by Dave Hansen for review even though, as he noted, nobody
outside of Intel will be able to actually run that code at this time.  Dave
is hoping to get comments on the (minimal) user-space API changes needed to
support MPK once the hardware is available.
<p>
In the proposed design, applications can set the page keys using any of the
system calls that set 
the other page protections â€” <tt>mprotect()</tt>, for example.  There are
four new flags defined (<tt>PROT_PKEY0</tt> through <tt>PROT_PKEY3</tt>) to
represent the key bits.  Within the kernel, these bits are stored in the
virtual memory area (VMA), and pushed into the relevant location in the
hardware page tables.  If a process attempts to access a page in a way that
is not allowed by the protection keys, it will get the usual
<tt>SIGSEGV</tt> signal.  Should it catch that signal, it
can look for the 
new <tt>SEGV_PKUERR</tt> code (in the <tt>si_code</tt> field of the
<tt>siginfo_t</tt> structure passed to the handler) to detect a fault
caused by a protection 
key.  There is not currently a way to determine which key caused the fault,
but adding that is on the list of things to do in the future.
<p>
One might well wonder why this feature is needed when everything it does
can be achieved with the memory-protection bits that already exist.  The
problem with the current bits is that they can be expensive to manipulate.
A change requires invalidating translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries across
the entire system, which is bad enough, but changing the protections on a
region of memory can require individually changing the page-table entries
for thousands (or more) pages.  Instead, once the protection keys are set,
a region of memory can be enabled or disabled with a single register
write.  For any application that frequently changes the protections on
regions of its address space, the performance improvement will be large.
<p>
There is still the question (as <a href="/Articles/643806/">asked</a> by
Ingo Molnar) of just why a process would want to make this kind of frequent
memory-protection change.  There would appear to be a few use cases driving
this development.  One is the handling of sensitive cryptographic data.  A
network-facing daemon could use a cryptographic key to encrypt data to be
sent over the wire, then disable access to the memory holding the key
(and the plain-text data)
before writing the data out.  At that point, there is no way that the
daemon can leak the key or the plain text over the wire; protecting
sensitive data in 
this way might also make applications a bit more resistant to attack.
<p>
Another commonly mentioned use case is to protect regions of data from being
corrupted by "stray" write operations.  An in-memory database could prevent
writes to the actual data most of the time, enabling them only briefly when
an actual change needs to be made.  In this way, database corruption due to
bugs could be fended off, at least some of the time.  Ingo was <a
href="/Articles/643808/">unconvinced</a> by this use case; he suggested
that a 64-bit address space should be big enough to hide data in and
protect it from corruption.  He also <a
href="/Articles/643809/">suggested</a> that a version of
<tt>mprotect()</tt> that optionally skipped TLB invalidation could address
many of the performance issues, especially if huge pages were used.
Alan Cox <a href="/Articles/643810/">responded</a>, though, that there is
real-world demand for the ability to change protection on gigabytes of
memory at a time, and that <tt>mprotect()</tt> is simply too slow.
<p>
Being able to turn off unexpected writes could be especially useful when
the underlying memory is a persistent memory device; any erroneous write
there will go immediately to permanent storage.  There have also been
suggestions that tools like <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>
could make good use of MPK.
<p>
Ingo's concerns notwithstanding, the MPK hardware feature is being added in
response to customer interest; it would be surprising if the kernel did not
end up supporting it, especially given that the required changes are not
hugely invasive.  So the real question is whether the proposed user-space
API is correct and supportable in the long run.  Hopefully, developers who
think they might make use of this feature will take a look at the patches
and make themselves heard if they find something they don't like.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes, the concept is not a new one in hardware.  At least x86, s390, powerpc and ia64 have some form of protection keys.  x86 was the outlier for *not* having it.<br>
<p>
However, there is currently no general support for these features on any of these architectures in Linux.  These patches are the first proposal I know of to use this hardware in Linux in any substantive way.<br>

ARM has had this in their MMU for ages, certainly at least since ARM9/ARMv5 (it's called Domain Access Control). The implementation is almost identical: 4 bits in the page table entry select a domain, and a 32-bit Domain Access Control Register has two bits for each of 16 domains to control access.<br>
<p>
Except instead of "write disable" and "read disable" bits, there is an extra level of indirection, where the bits choose "no access", "client access", or "manager access". "manager" is R/W, and "client access" can be configured per memory section (1MB virtual address space block) as various combinations of no access, read-only, and read-write for user and supervisor access levels.<br>

Some important differences though: DACR cannot be modified by userland without entering the kernel, while protection keys can.  AFAIK it's also not possible to implement execute-only pages using domains as no access means no access, whereas protection keys apply to data access only, not instruction fetches.  Domains affect the kernel as well while this only affects userland (currently).  Domains permit granting permissions greater than that specified by the page tables, while protection keys can only give out a subset of existing permissions (due to the userland-only design).<br>

One application use that may benefit from cheap changing of protections is garbage collection.  There are schemes where you want to catch it if additional pointers from old to new memory are written.  If such writes into old memory are rare, catching that with memory protection is more efficient than software checking of writes.  I am not sure if the keys described in the article are really useful for that, it has been some time since I read garbage collection papers.<br>

Another application use may be hardening JIT compiler-generated code against vulnerabilities.  Last year I heard a presentation where the JIT compiler was put in a separate process to get different protections for the JIT compiler than for the execution.  The protection keys may be an easier way to get the same protection.<br>

What does prevent malicious code from enabling access to all 16 regions in their own thread register before trying to access critical data?<br>

Ooh, so in 2015 there was some serious work on something that would be extremely valuable for Spectre mitigation!<br>
<p>
This seems extremely useful for partitioning untrusted code in a shared process, eg a web browser that doesn't want to take the process-per-domain hit. And for isolating components like the GC and JIT. It's not a complete protection from malicious attack, of course, since if you have somewhat-controlled execution of code within one partition, you may be able to change the key register, but it seems like a pretty good additional barrier to preventing that access in the first place.<br>
<p>
I would love to be able to efficiently ensure that no stray writes corrupt GC bookkeeping data. Any memory corruption anywhere tends to crash in the GC because it scans through and chases pointers with lots and lots of memory. This would make it so the mutator would crash immediately at the right place, making errors far far more obvious and likely to be fixed at the root.<br>

Some device drivers need firmware to load into the hardware at
initialization time.  The kernel firmware loader interface exists to
support that functionality, but it requires help from user space
which may not be available in all environments.  David Woodhouse has
proposed a patch that would
eliminate that requirement so that more drivers can use the firmware
loader rather than craft their own solution.
</p>

<p> Embedded devices will be one of the main users of this ability.  Many
of those do not have a user space filesystem available at boot
time&mdash;via initrd or initramfs&mdash;but they still need to access
firmware images to download to peripherals.  The new
<tt>request_firmware()</tt> implementation would allow those devices to
link the firmware into the kernel while still using the kernel firmware
infrastructure.  
</p>

<p>
Woodhouse has an excellent summary of what he is trying to do in the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/283759/">patch
posting</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Some drivers have their own hacks to bypass the kernel's firmware loader
and build their firmware into the kernel; this renders those unnecessary.
<p>
Other drivers don't use the firmware loader at all, because they always
want the firmware to be available. This allows them to start using the
firmware loader.
<p>
A third set of drivers already use the firmware loader, but can't be
used without help from userspace, which sometimes requires an initrd.
This allows them to work in a static kernel.
</div>
</p>

<p>
A driver that has static firmware data, declares it using:
<pre>
    DECLARE_BUILTIN_FIRMWARE("firmware_name", blob);
</pre>
The <tt>firmware_name</tt> is used as a key to find the specific firmware
when <tt>request_firmware()</tt> is called.  <tt>blob</tt> is a pointer to
the actual code.  The declaration adds the firmware to the end of an array
holding <tt>struct builtin_fw</tt> elements, which look like this:
<pre>
    struct builtin_fw {
            char *name;
            void *data;
            unsigned long size;
    };
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When a call is made to <tt>request_firmware()</tt>, the new code linearly
searches the array for a matching key before calling out to user space.
This allows any statically created firmware blobs to take precedence over
those in the filesystem.  Whichever is found is returned.
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be strong agreement that Woodhouse's approach was the right
way to go.  His original implementation copied
the firmware blob before returning it to a <tt>request_firmware()</tt>
caller which required a <tt>vmalloc()</tt>&mdash;a waste of precious memory
on embedded devices.
Woodhouse was concerned that some drivers might modify the firmware before
loading it into the device.  Once he started looking, he found examples of
that, but instead of penalizing all devices, he changed the firmware data
returned in a <tt>struct firmware</tt> to be constant, resulting in the
following structure:
<pre>
    struct firmware {
            size_t size;
            const u8 *data;
    };
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This constitutes an API change for anyone using the
<tt>request_firmware()</tt> interface.  In-tree drivers have been modified
by Woodhouse appropriately, but out-of-tree drivers need to be aware of the
change. Any driver that needs to modify the data
must make a copy for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Another feature that would be useful for memory-constrained devices is
compression of the firmware in the kernel image.  This is on Woodhouse's <a
href="/Articles/284141/">radar</a>, but is not seen as a feature that must be
in the first release.  Not copying the data for most drivers is
a bigger win, but compression, especially for large firmware images might
help.  In those cases, though, both the compressed and uncompressed data
will be in memory while the driver is downloading it.
</p>

<p>
Getting this work included into 2.6.26 has been discussed, even though the
merge window has closed.  Woodhouse <a href="/Articles/284150/">thinks</a>
it <i>might</i> be possible:
<div class="BigQuote">
Well, it's supposedly too late, but it's dead simple and shouldn't have
much chance of breaking anything, so I suppose as long as we don't
include the korg1212 patch and the rest of the similar patches which
we're still working on, that's not such an insane request.
</div>
</p>

<p>
This is a fairly simple patch that adds some very useful functionality,
especially for the embedded community.  Woodhouse has recently <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/283749/">stepped up as one the kernel
embedded maintainers</a>, so we may see more things like this from him in
the future.  It is unlikely that Linus Torvalds will merge this
feature 
so late in the 2.6.26 cycle, but inclusion into 2.6.27 seems quite probable.

      I think I've decided to kill off <TT>DECLARE_BUILTIN_FIRMWARE</TT>.<P>Instead, we're shifting the firmware blobs to ihex files in the <TT>firmware/</TT> subdirectory. Having them standalone means that we can also have a '<TT>make firmware_install</TT>' target which puts the same firmware files into <TT>/lib/firmware</TT> where udev can find them.<P>
With <TT>DECLARE_BUILTIN_FIRMWARE</TT> that wasn't feasible -- we could <em>only</em> build it in, and didn't easily have the option to have it loaded by userspace.

I'd prefer to have filesystem data (if available) take precedence; or, at least, be able to tell the kernel not to load the builtin stuff. Just for sanity, so if the firmware gets corrupted or I want to try a new version a full new kernel isn't required.

<p>Well, not really: you only need a buffer for the decompression mechanism, the size of which does not need to be big (not as big as todays firmwares at least!).</p>

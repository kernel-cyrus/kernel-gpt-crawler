<p>
Low-end devices bound for developing countries, such as those running the <a
href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/android-go-edition/">Android 
Go edition</a>, lack encryption support because the hardware doesn't provide any
cryptographic acceleration.  That means users in developing countries have
no protection for the data on their phones.  Google would like to change
that situation.  The company worked on adding the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck_(cipher)">Speck cipher</a> to the
kernel, but <a href="/Articles/761992/">decided against using it</a>
because of opposition due to Speck's origins at the US National
Security Agency (NSA).  As a replacement, the Adiantum encryption mode was
developed; it has been merged for Linux&nbsp;5.0.
</p>

<p>
Eric Biggers has been spearheading the effort; he <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20181117012631.23528-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/">posted</a>
version&nbsp;4 of the Adiantum patch set in mid-November and it was pulled
by kernel crypto maintainer Herbert Xu shortly thereafter; it will appear
in the&nbsp;5.0 kernel.  Meanwhile Speck was removed from the kernel
in&nbsp;4.20 for lack of any maintainer or users.
The Adiantum patch
description is lengthy and informative, but there is also a <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/720">paper</a> by Biggers and Paul
Crowley (who did much of the work in coming up with Adiantum and its
predecessor HPolyC).  Incidentally, the paper notes that the name
"Adiantum" is the genus of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiantum">maidenhair fern</a>.
</p>

<p>
Adiantum is intended to be a choice for the encryption and decryption algorithm 
for disk encryption on Linux systems.  It can be used either for
block-level encryption as part of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a> or for file and
directory encryption as part of <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/filesystems/fscrypt.html">fscrypt</a>.
Adiantum and its supporting crypto primitives needed to be added to the
kernel so that it can be used from these kernel subsystems.  Most of the
14-part patch set is adding various crypto primitives used by Adiantum.
</p>

<p>
It's worth noting that Adiantum is not a new encryption algorithm as such;
instead, it is a repackaging of the ChaCha stream cipher that makes it
useful for disk encryption.  That makes reasoning about its security
relatively straightforward:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Adiantum is a construction, not a primitive.  Its security is
	reducible to that of XChaCha12 and AES-256, subject to a security
	bound; the proof is in Section 5 of our paper.  Therefore, one need
	not "trust" Adiantum; they only need trust XChaCha12 and AES-256.
</div>
<p>
In this way, the authors have tried, with apparent success, to avoid the
trust issues that surrounded Speck.
<p>
Many low-end, inexpensive devices (e.g. mobile phones for the developing
world) and even some smartwatches are shipped with older or less powerful
Arm CPUs that lack 
the cryptographic extensions that more recent processors have.  The goal
was to find a way to encrypt filesystem data on those devices and, crucially, to be
able to decrypt it quickly enough that users will not be annoyed by the
performance—or have their batteries unduly impacted.  Speck mostly fit the
bill, but it turns out that Adiantum is even 
faster (roughly 30%), so the political issues that made Speck untenable
turned out to be a boon for users.
</p>

<p>
HPolyC was the original algorithm that Biggers and Crowley were planning to
use as a Speck replacement; it was already faster than Speck but some
further refinements led to Adiantum and even better performance.  The main
change between HPolyC and Adiantum is the hash function used.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305">Poly1305</a>
message authentication code (MAC) hash family is used by both, but Adiantum
first uses a hash from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMAC#NH_hash-function_family">NH family of hashes</a> to effectively compress the
data by 32x first.  After that, Adiantum uses Poly1305.
</p>

<p>
Both Poly1305 and NH are families of hash functions that are deemed "almost
universal".  A <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing">universal hash</a>
family has the property that it minimizes collisions even if the input is
controlled by an adversary.  Each member of the family is generally able to
spread the input over a wide number of buckets but any single member will
be susceptible to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack">preimage attack</a>.
By choosing one of the family members 
at random, that kind of attack is thwarted.
</p>

<p>
Using NH in addition to Poly1305 does reduce the key agility of Adiantum; the
paper recommends using HPolyC in applications that need to be able to
switch keys quickly.  For performance reasons, NH is easily implemented in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> assembly (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(NEON)">Arm
NEON</a>) but the more complicated Poly1305 is written in C, which
aids portability.

<p>
The encryption cipher used is XChaCha12, which is a block cipher based on
the ChaCha family of stream ciphers.  It uses 12 rounds, as the name would
imply, which is lower than the 20-round ChaCha that is commonly used.  The
best-known attacks against ChaCha are for the seven-round variant, so
ChaCha12 still provides a strong cipher.  Two rounds of XChaCha12 are
followed by an AES-256 encryption, but of just 16 bytes.  AES is often used for
disk encryption on
higher-end devices because their processors provide AES acceleration, but
it is far too slow and power hungry to run on low-end devices.
</p>

<p>
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20181117012631.23528-15-ebiggers@kernel.org/">According
to Biggers</a>, this provides a better security margin than HPolyC 
or AES.  In addition, Adiantum has the property that changing a single bit in
the input completely scrambles the block, unlike other modes (e.g. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#XTS">XTS</a>),
where it will only 
affect 16 bytes in the block. 
</p>

<p>
Adiantum is a length-preserving encryption, which is important for disk
encryption.  It would be ideal to store random nonces along with each block
of ciphertext, Biggers said, but that requires another layer (such as <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/device-mapper/dm-integrity.txt">dm-integrity</a>)
to manage the extra data per block.  That negatively impacts performance,
so, at least for now, length-preserving encryption is needed.
</p>

<p>
"Encryption for all" is an explicit goal in various domains; it has driven
the push for "HTTPS Everywhere", for example.  It is nice to see work being
done to ensure that people in developing countries will be able to secure
their data on what may well be their only computing device: their
mobile phone.  One hopes that Adiantum and HPolyC will be adopted widely—in
Android and beyond.

Thanks for reporting on this work!  A few clarifications:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; As a replacement, the Adiantum encryption mode was developed</font><br>
<p>
FWIW, we started work on this even before we proposed Speck128-XTS as a faster-to-deploy solution.  So it's been in the works for longer than it may seem.  Though, naturally development did speed up when it became clear there wouldn't be an interim solution.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Speck mostly fit the bill, but it turns out that Adiantum is even faster (roughly 30%), so the political issues that made Speck untenable turned out to be a boon for users.</font><br>
<p>
To be clear, Adiantum is only faster on sufficiently long messages; the 30% number is for 4096-byte messages.  But that's fine for the intended use cases.  To get good performance some dm-crypt users will need to use 4096-byte sectors rather than the default of 512, but they really ought to be doing so anyway.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The encryption cipher used is XChaCha12, which is a block cipher based on the ChaCha family of stream ciphers.</font><br>
<p>
XChaCha12 is still a stream cipher; it just accepts a longer nonce than ChaCha12.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Two rounds of XChaCha12</font><br>
<p>
Normally there is just one XChaCha12 invocation per encryption or decryption.  There's another to derive subkeys, but that's only needed when setting a new key.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; According to Biggers, this provides a better security margin than HPolyC or AES.</font><br>
<p>
I didn't say exactly that :-)  Adiantum and HPolyC both use the same cryptographic primitives: XChaCha12 and AES-256.  So their "security margin" under the usual definition (percent of total rounds the best attack doesn't reach) is the same, and can't really be better than XChaCha12's or AES-256's alone.  But that's not the only measure of security; for example, slightly more messages can be safely encrypted with the same key with Adiantum than HPolyC, due to the different choice of universal hash function family.  (Though, in practice it doesn't matter as the number of messages is extremely large in both cases!)<br>

Wait, are you saying the default in LUKS is 512? How can I see what I'm using? Can I change it without a luksFormat with --sector-size?<br>

I don't know if it is realistic to change the block size after the fact I suspect it is a creation time parameter from looking at `man 8 cryptsetup`.<br>
<p>
```<br>
       --sector-size &lt;bytes&gt;<br>
              Set sector size for use with disk encryption. It must  be  power<br>
              of  two  and in range 512 - 4096 bytes. The default is 512 bytes<br>
              sectors.  This option is available only in the LUKS2 mode.<br>
<p>
              Note that if sector size is higher than underlying device  hard‐<br>
              ware sector and there is not integrity protection that uses data<br>
              journal, using this option can increase risk on incomplete  sec‐<br>
              tor writes during a power fail.<br>
<p>
              If  used together with --integrity option and dm-integrity jour‐<br>
              nal, the atomicity of writes is guaranteed in all cases (but  it<br>
              cost write performance - data has to be written twice).<br>
<p>
              Increasing  sector size from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes can provide<br>
              better performance on most of the  modern  storage  devices  and<br>
              also with some hw encryption accelerators.<br>

Yes, the dm-crypt sector size is a creation-time parameter.  The default is 512 bytes, but since Linux v4.12 larger sizes are supported.  With cryptsetup/LUKS, 4K sectors require cryptsetup v2.0.0+ and using the LUKS2 format.  cryptsetup v2.0.6+ supports Adiantum; an example format command with Adiantum is:<br>
<p>
	cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 --sector-size 4096 -c xchacha12,aes-adiantum-plain64 -s 256 &lt;device&gt;<br>
<p>
But 4K sectors can be used with other ciphers too.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, fscrypt (which will also support Adiantum in Linux v5.0) has always encrypted file contents in 4K blocks.<br>

It took some fiddling around to discover it, but this is the procedure to list the sector size on an existing device.  I've poked at several systems and at least as of f28, the install wizard doesn't seem to be changing the default sector size.<br>
<p>
```<br>
$ sudo dmsetup ls --target crypt<br>
luks-4b88e721-274f-44de-8668-c1bda37ee74b	(253, 0)<br>
luks-8ec7f0a1-5670-400c-9b0e-809cf65aa09d	(253, 4)<br>
 $ sudo cryptsetup status luks-8ec7f0a1-5670-400c-9b0e-809cf65aa09d<br>
/dev/mapper/luks-8ec7f0a1-5670-400c-9b0e-809cf65aa09d is active and is in use.<br>
  type:    LUKS1<br>
  cipher:  aes-xts-plain64<br>
  keysize: 512 bits<br>
  key location: dm-crypt<br>
  device:  /dev/sda2<br>
  sector size:  512<br>
  offset:  4096 sectors<br>
  size:    1462509568 sectors<br>
  mode:    read/write<br>
```<br>
<p>
There also isn't any mention of setting the sector size in the fedora wiki: <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Disk_Encryption_User_Guide">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Disk_Encryption_User_Guide</a> nor does there appear to be a builtin mechanism to configure it via kickstart but, presumably, it could be done in a `%pre` block.<br>
<p>
Is there any reason not change the `crytsetup` default to be 4K?<br>

<p>
(1) Compatibility with old kernels and cryptsetup versions.  The 4K encryption sector support is still fairly new, after all.<br>
<p>
(2) It's not guaranteed safe on disks with 512-byte sectors, as it can break atomicity guarantees that might be assumed by software.  I don't believe this is a problem on modern disks or flash storage, nor on ext4 or f2fs.  But the cryptsetup default needs to be more conservative.<br>

<p>
Yes for some markets; many new low-end devices are still being designed and shipped with 32-bit processors like Cortex-A7 that lack AES instructions, and it's unclear when this will change.  They do have NEON still.  Also even some low-end ARMv8 processors, e.g. Cortex-A53 in some SoCs, lack AES instructions.<br>

<p>
This is answered in the announcement (<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-you...</a>).  The requirement is that apps provide 64-bit versions, not that they cannot provide 32-bit versions; Play will continue to support 32-bit.  Also it doesn't apply to apps explicitly targeting Wear OS or Android TV.<br>

While for this specific use case (encryption of dedicated local storage) the idea of introducing less expensive encryption options is preferable to nothing, I'm worried about how this could bleed into other use cases.  We've seen a number of cases where people attack communications systems which allow a choice of encryption options by forcing use of a weak or broken option in order to intercept or modify data.  In the world of USB flash drives, in general, we are stuck with the FAT filesystem because that's the only thing that every device can handle.  Even low-end devices often have some way to use them with removable storage (USB OTG, microSD cards).  I would hate for everyone to use "bad" encryption on such devices just because that was the only option that everyone supported.  At a minimum, I hope that vendors continue to ship devices that support all of the options no matter how slow the implementation might be.  I would even encourage making the more secure option the default for removable storage when a user requests such device to be formatted securely.<br>

Adiantum is not "bad encryption".  Not only does it use modern ciphers with 256-bit keys and substantial security margins, but it's also the first wide-block encryption mode in the kernel.  Wide-block modes (tweakable super-pseudorandom permutations) are the state of the art in disk encryption research as they protect against a stronger class of adversary than narrow-block modes such as XTS, LRW, and CBC.<br>
<p>
Storage encryption in Android is local to the device; by design other devices cannot decrypt the data.  This includes SD cards used as "adoptable storage".  SD cards used as "removable storage" are actually unencrypted FAT as that is the lowest common denominator among all computers and devices; the availability of a new encryption algorithm on some devices will not change that.<br>

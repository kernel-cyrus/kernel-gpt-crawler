Persistent memory offers the prospect of large amounts (e.g. terabytes) of
directly attached memory that retains its contents over a system reboot or
power 
cycle.  It also offers a number of interesting design problems with regard
to how it should be managed; persistent memory looks a lot like ordinary
memory, but it differs in a number of important ways.  As a result, there
has been a long discussion over how to deal with this memory and, in
particular, whether the kernel should use <tt>page</tt> structures to describe
it or not.  As shown in some recent patch sets, the
discussion continues to evolve, and it seems to be heading toward an
interesting answer to the <tt>struct page</tt> question.
<p>
For those needing a quick recap, <a href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>struct
page</tt></a> is the kernel's fundamental memory-management data structure;
one <tt>page</tt> structure exists for each page of memory present in the
system.  In current kernels, though, persistent memory does not have
accompanying <tt>page</tt> structures for a simple reason: the amount of
memory required to hold all of those structures looks prohibitive.  Storing
them in the persistent memory array itself is possible (and discussed
further below), but <tt>page</tt> structures change frequently, making them
a poor fit for persistent memory storage, which (1)&nbsp;tends to be slow
for writes, and (2)&nbsp;will wear out more quickly if subjected to
sustained frequent writes.
<p>
As long as a persistent-memory array is treated like a disk
drive, there is no need for <tt>page</tt> structures.  But if persistent
memory is to take part in DMA or direct I/O operations, it currently needs
those structures; for that reason, such operations do not currently work on
persistent memory.  This problem is widely seen as needing a fix.
<p>
When we <a
href="/Articles/644079/">last looked at the discussion</a> in May, there
was a push toward using page-frame numbers (PFNs) as a replacement for
<tt>page</tt> structures in various I/O paths.  A PFN is easily derived
from a page's physical address, so it is an easy and obvious way to refer
to a physical page of memory — if the additional information stored in the
<tt>page</tt> structure is not needed for any given operation.
In May, though, it was becoming clear that this information cannot always
be done without, and, thus,
that this approach had its limitations, especially when it came to
supporting direct I/O, which is the most scalable I/O mode that the kernel
offers.
<p>
<h4>Using page-frame numbers</h4>
<p>
Nonetheless, work continues on the PFN-based approach.  Christoph Hellwig
posted <a href="/Articles/654273/">this patch series</a> adapting the DMA
subsystem so that it could manage scatter/gather lists containing PFNs.  A
scatter/gather list describes an I/O operation that is spread across
multiple regions of memory; these lists are used for almost all nontrivial
I/O operations, since I/O buffers are rarely situated in a
single, physically contiguous block of memory.  Making scatter/gather lists
work without <tt>page</tt> structures would, for the most part, solve the
problem of doing DMA on buffers stored in persistent memory.  Christoph's
patch doesn't do that, but it abstracts out the references to <tt>page</tt>
structures, making it easy to use PFNs instead in the future.
<p>
Beyond this preparatory work, though, the kernel needs the ability to work
more extensively with PFNs.  Happily, on the same day, Dan Williams posted
<a href="/Articles/654396/">a new revision</a> of his patch series
implementing the <tt>__pfn_t</tt> type for the management of pages by PFN.
The new <tt>__pfn_t</tt> type is simpler than it was the last time around:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef struct {
    	unsigned long val;
    } __pfn_t;
</pre>
<p>
There is no more trickery with storing PFNs and <tt>struct page</tt>
pointers in the same structure.  There are, however, a few bits of
<tt>val</tt> that are used for related purposes: to chain entries in
scatter/gather lists, for example and,
in the case of the <tt>PFN_DEV</tt> bit, to indicate that the PFN has no
associated 
<tt>page</tt> structure in the system.  There is a set of helper functions
to do things like get the actual PFN number (<tt>__pfn_t_to_pfn()</tt>) or
the physical address (<tt>__pfn_t_to_phys()</tt>) associated with a
<tt>__pfn_t</tt> value.
<p>
One common use for a <tt>page</tt> structure is to map the associated page
into the kernel's address space with <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt>; that allows
the kernel to manipulate that page directly.  For code dealing with PFN
values instead of <tt>page</tt> structures, Dan's patch set adds
<tt>kmap_atomic_pfn_t()</tt> to do the same job; it will work regardless of
whether the PFN it is given refers to ordinary or persistent memory.
Interestingly, when successful, <tt>kmap_atomic_pfn_t()</tt> returns with
the RCU read lock held, and <tt>kunmap_atomic_pfn_t()</tt> expects to
release that lock.
<p>
The final patch in the series converts the scatter/gather DMA code over to
the use of PFNs instead of page structures.  That should enable the DMA
code to work on persistent memory, though it seems that there may be some
remaining issues on a few architectures.
<p>
The PFN-based approach is not universally admired; in particular, 
there has been some <a
href="/Articles/656200/">resistance</a> from Boaz Harrosh, who believes
that <tt>page</tt> structures should always be used with persistent memory
— and who posted <a href="/Articles/608538/">a patch set</a> to that effect
one year ago.  Boaz's patches don't seem to have been developed since then,
though, and his objections do not appear to be slowing things down much.
David Miller has also <a href="/Articles/656201/">expressed discomfort</a>
with the idea of memory without <tt>page</tt> structures, for what it's
worth.
<p>
<h4>Back to page structures</h4>
<p>
These misgivings notwithstanding, persistent-memory developers clearly see
value in providing access to this memory without associated <tt>page</tt>
structures.  So it may have come as a surprise to some when Dan also posted
<a href="/Articles/656263/">this patch series</a> adding none other than
<tt>struct page</tt> support for persistent memory.  In the end, it seems,
there are certain things that simply cannot be done without <tt>page</tt>
structures; direct I/O and remote DMA are two features at the top of that
list.  This patch set allows the creation of these structures on systems
where they are needed while allowing the rest to avoid the associated
overhead.
<p>
This patch set adds a new type of block device that sits on top of the
existing <a href="/Articles/640113/">pmem driver</a> that was merged for
the 4.1 kernel.  The driver for this new device will add a
persistent-memory range to the system's memory map, using the memory
hotplugging mechanism.  The memory goes into a special zone
(<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt>) created for this purpose, though, so it will not be
made available to the rest of the system like ordinary memory.  As part of
this process, the driver allocates an array of <tt>page</tt> structures to
describe this memory range.
<p>
Allocating that array brings us back to the problem of memory consumption:
a large persistent-memory block will require a large array of <tt>page</tt>
structures to describe it.  One possible solution to this problem is to
introduce a new structure for variably sized pages, or to simply use huge
pages, but Dan's patch set sticks to the ordinary <tt>page</tt> structure
describing 4KB pages.  So the memory-consumption problem remains.
<p>
The original version of the patch offered an interesting approach to that
problem: the decision of <i>where</i> these <tt>page</tt> structures should
live was pushed out to user space.  By tweaking a sysfs attribute, the
system administrator could direct those structures into ordinary memory, or
could instead cause them to be stored in the persistent-memory array
itself.  So large arrays could host their own <tt>page</tt> structures.
As mentioned above, persistent memory may not be the best place to store
those structures, but, for many use cases, it may work well
enough, and this approach does make the problem of <tt>page</tt> structures
taking up too much RAM go away.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/656264/">current version of this patch set</a> drops
that feature, though, and instead stores <tt>page</tt> structures in RAM
unconditionally.  That change simplifies the memory-management changes,
making it easier to get the patch set reviewed and merged.  Expect the
store-in-persistent-memory option to return in the future, though, as the
huge arrays we've been promised finally start to show up in the mass
market.
<p>
Meanwhile, we now have a set of patches that make persistent memory behave
almost entirely like ordinary memory with regard to management within the
kernel.  That means that, assuming this work is merged, Linux is
essentially ready to support the use of persistent memory for a wide
variety of use cases.  What remains, at this point, is to see just what
developers will do once they have terabyte-sized arrays of persistent
memory available to play with.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

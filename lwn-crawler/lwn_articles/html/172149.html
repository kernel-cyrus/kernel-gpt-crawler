<h1>Robust futexes - a new approach</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 15, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
One of the many features added during the 2.5 development series was the
"futex" - a sort of fast, user-space mutual exclusion primitive.  In the
non-contended case, futexes can be obtained and released with no kernel
involvement at all, making them quite fast.  When contention does happen
(one process tries to obtain a futex currently owned by another), the
kernel is called in to queue any waiting processes and wake them up when
the futex becomes available.  When queueing is not needed, however, the
kernel maintains no knowledge of the futex, keeping its overhead low.
<p>

There is one problem with keeping the kernel out of the picture, however.
If a process comes to an untimely end while holding a futex, there is no
way to release that futex and let other processes know about the problem.
The SYSV semaphore mechanism - a much more heavyweight facility - has an
"undo" mechanism which can be called into play in this sort of situation,
but there is no such provision for futexes.  As a result, a few different
"robust futex" patches have been put together over the past years; LWN <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/67194/">looked at one of them</a> in January,
2004.  These patches have tended to greatly increase the cost of futexes,
however, and none have been accepted into the mainline.
<p>

Ingo Molnar, working with Thomas Gleixner and Ulrich Drepper, has tossed
aside those years' worth of work and, in a couple of days, produced <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/172134/">a new robust futex patch</a> which,
he hopes, will find its way into the mainline.  The new patch has the
advantage of being fast, but, as Ingo notes:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Be warned though - the patchset does things we normally dont do in
	Linux, so some might find the approach disturbing. Parental advice
	recommended&nbsp;;-)
</div>
<p>

The fundamental problem to solve is that the kernel must, somehow, know
about all futexes held by an exiting process in order to release them.  A
past solution has been the addition of a system call to notify the kernel
of lock acquisitions and releases.  That approach defeats one of the main
features of futexes - their speed.  It also adds a record-keeping and
resource limiting problem to the kernel, and suffers from some problematic
race conditions.
<p>

So Ingo's patch takes a different approach.  A list of held futexes is
maintained for each thread, but that list lives in user space.  All the
thread has to do is to make a single call to a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    long set_robust_list(struct robust_list_head *head, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
That call informs the kernel of the location of a linked list of held
futexes in the calling process's address space; there is also a
<tt>get_robust_list()</tt> call for retrieving that information.
Typically, this call would be made by glibc, and never seen by the
application.  Glibc would also take on the task of maintaining the list of
futexes.
<p>

When a process dies, the kernel looks for a pointer to a user-space futex
list.  Should that pointer be found, the kernel will carefully walk through
it, bearing in mind that, as a user-space data structure, it could be
accidentally or maliciously corrupt.  For each held futex, the kernel will
release the lock and set it to a special value indicating that the previous
holder made a less-than-graceful exit.  It will then wake a waiting
process, if one exists.  That process will be able to see that it has
obtained the lock under dubious circumstances (user-space functions like
<tt>pthread_mutex_lock()</tt> are able to return that information) and take
whatever action it deems to be necessary.  The kernel will release a
maximum of one million locks; that keeps the kernel from looping forever on
a circular list.  Given the practical difficulties of making a million-lock
application work at all, that limit should not constrain anybody for quite
some time.
<p>

There is still a race condition here: if a process dies between the time it
acquires a lock and when it updates the list, that lock might not be
released by the kernel.  Getting around that problem involves a bit of poor
kernel hacker's journaling.  The head of the held futex list contains a
single-entry field which can be used to point to a lock which the
application is about to acquire.  The kernel will check that field on exit,
and, if it points to a lock actually held by the application, that lock
will be released with the others.  So, if glibc sets that field before
acquiring a lock (and clears it after the list is updated), all locks held
by the application will be covered.
<p>

The discussion on this patch was just beginning when this article was
written.  There is some concern about having the kernel walking through
user-space data structures; the chances of trouble and security problems
are certainly higher when that is going on.  Other issues may yet come up
as well.  But, since this is clearly not a 2.6.16 feature in any case,
there will be time to talk about them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      If I understand the description correction this is a little like the<br>
virtual DSO (VDSO) in reverse.<br>
<p>
The VDSO method is to provide a virtual library ... a kernel page containing<br>
some userspace code ... which is mapped into the address space of every<br>
process.  These process can than access certain system functions (via SYSENTER on x86 processors that support it) without making system calls (via int 0x80H on x86).  (On other x86 CPUs the virtual library page can be be implemented as old int 0x80H calls if necessary).<br>
<p>
This patch allows a userspace process to register a pointer into its memory ... later allowing the kernel to peek into that memory region to find any futexes that are locked.  So you suffer on system call and then the rest of the operations are memory accesses (and the kernel knows when to look in process space for them, and where to look).<br>
<p>
Is that the gist of it?<br>
<p>

      correct - this is about a complex and constantly changing userspace data structure being parsed by the kernel in certain cases. This is not the usual 'pass info the kernel' or 'pass info to userspace' kernel&lt;-&gt;userspace data interaction that we normally do.<br>
<p>
you are also right that there is a single (very fast) syscall per thread-lifetime. While this is already quite close to 'zero cost', and it is alot cheaper than the other solutions presented before, we could speed this up further by passing this pointer to sys_clone() - that would eliminate the extra syscall in the case of pthread_create().<br>

      Would this allow for the development of functions similar to those found in Solaris, namely pthread_mutexattr_getrobust_np(), pthread_mutexattr_setrobust_np(), and pthread_mutex_consistent_np()?  (The "_np" is for non-portable, if I remember correctly.)<br>

      Correct - these APIs are being standardized by POSIX, and this patchset aims at enabling them. Ulrich Drepper (glibc's maintainer) has already written the necessary glibc modifications to enable robust pthread_mutex_t mutexes, so once the new syscalls are accepted by the upstream kernel, glibc support should follow soon.<br>

      What happens if you grab one of these locks, and you fork() ?<br>
<p>
What happens if you fork() and then exit() ? Will glibc go round freeing all of these things up - things that the parent still believes that it holds ?<br>

      RedHat still dead set on fixing futexes???<br>
<p>
After so many years of struggling with them I'd rather threw them away.<br>
<p>
I still recall the frustration on RedHat mail lists after the release of RHL8. Nothing else but RPM itself was constantly hanging on call to futexes. The most frustrating part of course was the cold silence on the problem from RH employees... As if problem didn't exist...<br>

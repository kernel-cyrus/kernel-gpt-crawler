<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 4, 2015</br>
           </div>
Back in the dim and distant past (2001), somebody going by the name "imel"
posted <a href="/2001/0426/a/single-user.php3">a patch</a> eliminating the
concept of users in the kernel and causing everything to run as root.
Unsurprisingly, this patch was not taken particularly seriously at the
time.  But a version of that patch has returned nearly fourteen years
later; this time around it has succeeded in generating a bit more
discussion.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/631857/">patch in question</a> comes from Iulia
Manda; it creates a kernel configuration option that removes the concept of
multi-user operation.  When appropriately configured, the kernel runs every
process with user and group IDs of zero and all capability bits set.  This
option also removes support for a long list of system calls dealing with
user and group IDs and capabilities.
<p>
As is often the case with the more eyebrow-raising patches, this one is
driven by the kernel "tinification" effort that seeks to shoehorn the
kernel into small-memory systems.  Such systems are likely to be running a
single, dedicated application, perhaps as the init process, and they have little
use for many of the features provided by the kernel â€” including multi-user
operation.  Configuring that support out saves a bit of memory (about
25KB), making it easier to fit a contemporary kernel on the smallest
systems-on-chip.
<p>
Given the nature of the patch, it would not be surprising to see a chorus
of opposition on the lists.  In fact, the set of opponents consists mainly
of Casey Schaufler, who <a href="/Articles/631862/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Authoritative LSM hooks were loudly rejected in or about 1999.  One
	of the primary reasons they were rejected was because you could use
	them do exactly what this patch does, which is to remove the basic
	Linux security policy. If attitudes have changed sufficiently that
	removing the "classic" security behavior is now deemed acceptable,
	I propose that we reintroduce the option of authoritative LSM hooks
	instead.
</div>
<p>
"Authoritative LSM hooks" are Linux security module functions that are able to
increase the privilege level of a running process.  They were <a
href="/2001/1108/kernel.php3#authhooks">extensively debated back in
2001</a> when the 
security module mechanism was being developed.  Authoritative hooks did not
make the cut in the end; they were seen as a significant security risk in
their own right.  At that time, one Casey Schaufler <a
href="/2001/1108/a/cs-hooks.php3">criticized the decision</a>, seeing it as
a selling-out of important functionality to ease the merging of security
modules into the kernel. 
<p>
Many years later, Casey clearly has not forgotten.  He would apparently like
to see the single-user option, if it is to be included at all, implemented
as a security module using authoritative hooks.  The tinification
developers are <a href="/Articles/631864/">unimpressed</a> by that idea,
though; reimplementing authoritative hooks would involve reviving an old
(and resolved) discussion to get to a possibly inferior solution to the
problem they are interested in addressing.  So this patch is unlikely to
evolve in that direction.
<p>
Beyond that, though, Casey <a href="/Articles/631866/">raised a
complaint</a> that has come up before with regard to tinification patches:
"<q>You are opening the door to creating a 'Linux' kernel that does not 
behave like Linux.</q>"  Many of the patches in this area will, by their
basic nature, have that effect; they are, after all, concerned with
removing functionality that is not needed for one specific use case.  If
the kernel is to be suitable for deployment on tiny systems, it will need
to be flexible enough to "not behave like Linux" on those systems.
<p>
That is one way of seeing the problem, anyway.  Josh Triplett <a
href="/Articles/631868/">responded</a> that it has long been possible to
configure functionality out of the kernel and that the single-user patches
are nothing special or new:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So what's this about "not behaving like Linux"?  Linux is whatever
	lives in linux.git; it's a lot more capable these days, and that
	doesn't just mean *adding* features.  The alternative to a tinier
	Linux isn't a larger Linux, it's non-Linux embedded OSes that
	behave *nothing* like Linux because they're *not Linux*.
</div>
<p>
In the end, it comes down to a couple of questions: can the tinification
developers package their changes in a way that the larger development
community can accept, and is that community willing to tolerate patches
that enable fundamental changes in how the kernel works?  The discussion is
not new, of course; it <a href="/Articles/608945/">came up at the 2014
Kernel Summit</a> among other places.  It does not look like one that will
come to any sort of quick conclusion.  But, in the end, if Linux is not
able to run well on very small systems, it will likely be pushed aside by a
system that <i>does</i> work well in that environment.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The patch doesn't appear to remove uid and gid fields from any data structures (in memory, I mean; changing filesystem format on disk is probably not worth it).  Is that not considered a worthwhile saving because these tiny systems only run a small number of processes?<br>
<p>
Come to think of it, I look forward to the next tinification patch that removes support for multiple processes, scheduling, and makes the only running process always have pid 1.<br>

I think scheduling would be needed anyway, at least in some simplified form, to handle the kernel threads (you know, all processes with the command listed as [foo]).<br>

You're right that there are kernel threads but do they need to be pre-empted?  If you can be sure that no kernel thread will busy-wait for long periods then you can dispense with the scheduler interrupt and also with any complex scheduling decision (just run the first eligible thing in the list).<br>

IIRC, kernel threads can't be preempted unless you enable CONFIG_PREEMPT, and couldn't be preempted at all before CONFIG_PREEMPT was first added to the kernel a long time ago.<br>

What always could be preempted (through any interrupt, but usually the timer tick) is userspace threads.<br>

Right - so if you have only a single userspace process, and it is single-threaded, then no scheduler is needed.  Just run the first eligible task each time, and wait for it to block.  If the number of kernel threads can be known ahead of time then a fixed size data structure can hold the details.<br>

Hmm, I wasn't aware that kernel threads might need to pre-empt a userspace process.  I expected that the user process would yield the next time it makes a system call, and if it makes no system calls, it doesn't need the kernel to do anything, and so kernel threads can wait.<br>
<p>
I guess that then you need to add an explicit scheduling step when returning from a system call, which may not exist at the moment.<br>

<p>
That might potentially be worth doing, but it'd require a much more invasive patch for much less gain.  And yes, unless you have a large number of processes or other data structures involving UID/GID, you likely wouldn't see much savings; and if you have a large number of processes, what are you doing running *all* of them as root? :)<br>

Compiling out fork() and exec() is definitely on the list.<br>
<p>
Compiling out the scheduler would be rather more challenging, since that would also imply no kernel threads or other background processing.<br>

Removing the scheduler entirely may be out of the question, but BFS may be worth looking at as an alternative. It's quite a bit less complex than CFS, and designed with low (realistic desktop) numbers of cores in mind.<br>

It strikes me that this is being horrified that someone might use their hardware differently than you do.  <br>

Who the heck cares?  If they run a Linux kernel that looks nothing at all like Linux on my machine, what harm does that do me?<br>

He makes it sound almost like the Linux design is somehow holy, and that it would be heretical to do it any other way. <br>

I think the idea is that no one minds what you do with your own kernel, but if you want patches merged upstream then they need to be in the spirit of Linux.<br>

For what it's worth, I support this particular kernel patch.<br>

How can you even define that?  And why would you want to?   If someone uses the kernel tree to make a box that doesn't look much at all like yours, how are you hurt?<br>
<p>
Shouldn't decisions like that be purely from a maintenance/coding perspective?<br>

Well, what if someone showed up and wanted to have a JVM implementation merged into the kernel. At some point someone has to say "no, we won't take this upstream". I don't think anyone would be upset if someone "uses the kernel tree to make a box that doesn't look much at all like yours", but whether or not the changes they made should be brought upstream is the subject of discussion.<br>

If you might potentially have a use for it, we could use some explicit statements to that effect on LKML in response to the patch.  Users asking for a feature make a much more compelling argument for that feature.<br>

I've just had a quick look through something called Linux 0.0.1.  I'm happy to be shot down because I'm not a native C reader but I couldn't see any evidence of UID != 0 I did see a directory called /usr/root mentioned though for HOME strangely enough.<br>
<p>
Should that original release not be considered Linux anymore?  A bit glib maybe but I think the ability to flag away chunks of what is unnecessary for the task in hand is probably a good idea and well within the spirit of "Linux".<br>
<p>
My x86 and amd64 usage is rather different from the other arches and this seems to me like yet another arch that simply has different capabilities to many of the other ones.  It's possible I might want to make use of that facility (dropping extra code paths if it were possible) even on amd64 if it might improve performance.  Give *me* the choice, please. <br>

It is funny to see this side to side with another article about enforcing password policies. For some reason I expect that if a similar configuration switch enters the kernel there will be home boxes configured with the switch on. In fact, I know a few people who used to configure their machines with just a root user. Well, maybe security awareness has risen a bit since that time.<br>

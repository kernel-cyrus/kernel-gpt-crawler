<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
A discussion that largely centered around the <a
href="https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelProjects/iomap">documentation of
iomap</a>, which provides a block-mapping interface for modern filesystems,
was led by Luis Chamberlain at the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>. There is an ongoing process of
converting filesystems to use iomap, in order to <a
href="/Articles/931809/">leave buffer heads 
behind</a> and to better support <a href="/Articles/893512/">folios</a>, so
the intent was to get feedback on the documentation from developers who are
working on those conversions.  One of the concrete outcomes of the session
was a plan to move that documentation from its current location on the
KernelNewbies wiki <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230518144037.3149361-1-mcgrof@kernel.org/">into
the kernel documentation</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Hannes Reinecke said that the lack of clear units in the iomap
documentation confused him; were things specified in bytes,
sectors, pages, or something else?  In addition, there are many different
operation-function pointers, in three different <tt>struct&nbsp;*_ops</tt>,
that need to be 
provided by a filesystem, but it was not clear to him what each of them was
meant to do.  Chamberlain said that it had also confused him when he started
looking at iomap, but the basic idea is that there are lots of different
types of operations, many with flags or options of various sorts, so the
myriad of 
ops are just meant to split those out into their own separate functions.
The alternative is a single function with lots of complexity to handle all
of the different possibilities.  Reinecke said that he was fine with having
all of those functions,
but that the documentation did not (yet) explain what all the operations
were for. 
</p>

<p>
The documentation tries to explain what is needed to convert a filesystem
to use iomap, Chamberlain said.  There are sections for direct I/O,
buffered I/O, file-extent mapping, and so on.  
Iomap provides an iterator for ranges; it tries to replace the existing
block-range operations.
As was discussed in the
earlier 
buffer-head session, though, there are no helpers for metadata operations
in iomap. 
Filesystems have to implement their own metadata handling, as XFS does, or
continue to use 
buffer heads for that.  Adding helpers to iomap is possible, but may not be
all that useful because the filesystems that have their own metadata
operations are not likely to want to switch to something new, he said.
</p>

<p>
Reinecke summarized the current thinking on iomap; it is the interface that
new filesystems should be using and, as discussed in the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/933437/">large-block-size session</a>, it
will be the only way for filesystems to support block sizes
larger than the page size. He noted that the <a
href="/Articles/930173/">patch set allowing buffer heads to be configured
out of the kernel</a> may not really be useful, though, because UEFI
systems need a VFAT filesystem, which currently requires buffer heads. He
has patches to convert VFAT to iomap, which are partially working at this
point, so that problem may go away in time. 
</p>

<p>
The suggested order for reworking filesystems in the iomap documentation
should be switched, Reinecke said; it currently has direct I/O as the first
thing to convert, but he thought it should be left for last.  Josef Bacik
said that Btrfs has been doing the conversion and it started with direct
I/O, because changing the buffered-I/O path requires reworking a lot more
code; he thinks that the direct-I/O conversion is more straightforward for
filesystems to tackle first.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o cautioned that doing conversions on the simpler filesystems first
may not be the right path either.  Iomap is missing some of the necessary
infrastructure to make the process less painful; metadata reads and writes
are a prime example of that.  In addition, many of the simple filesystems
do not support direct I/O at all, so they cannot start there; meanwhile
they do need the ability to read and write metadata, so asking them to
convert right now is likely to result in developers who "run away
screaming".  
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara said that there are two facets to the iomap
conversion: handling the data path with iomap, which is ready to be done
now, and removing buffer heads, which is a separate question that requires
a "sane story for them".  It is important to recognize that filesystems
cannot be forced to fully convert to iomap, Reinecke said; that is the
eventual goal, but 
it may never be reached.  Kara said that he had patches queued that convert
the ext2 direct-I/O data path to iomap; those patches also include some VFS
changes that will make that conversion easier for the simpler
filesystems.  The more complex filesystems, such as ext4, Btrfs, and XFS, do not
need those changes because they already have internal helpers.  He is
working with Ritesh Harjani on converting the rest of the ext2 data path to
iomap. 
</p>

<p>
The next step would be to convert the metadata handling, but there are not
good answers for that yet.  Reinecke said he had been working with others to
provide helpers that will allow filesystems to request data transfers in sizes
smaller than a page, and get back a folio and offset into it where the data
is located; for his purposes, it does not really matter if&nbsp;512 bytes or a
whole page is read as long as he knows where to get the data he is
interested in.  Then, the sub-page write piece needs to be worked out; once
those pieces are in place, the conversion of the metadata paths can be
tackled.
</p>

<p>
Harjani came in over the remote link to talk about the work he has been
doing on the buffered-I/O path for ext2.  There are some open problems, one
of which is being addressed by a <a href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1687140389.git.ritesh.list@gmail.com/">patch series</a> under review for sub-page
dirty tracking.  Another issue is that the <tt>BH_Boundary</tt> flag is
currently used for filesystems, like 
ext2, that can have indirect blocks that are discontinuous; if the BIO
covering the range gets rearranged, it can lead to a sub-optimal
data-access pattern.  The flag is not supported in iomap, but probably
needs to be the next piece addressed after the dirty tracking.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that the issue really only affected filesystems that use 
V7-Unix-style indirect blocks, which VFAT, for example, does not use;
modern filesystems use extent mapping instead.  So this may be an example
of something that iomap may want to support for better performance for
those older filesystems like ext2, minix, and UFS, but it may be decided
that the performance without adding the feature is good enough and "we'll
live with a performance hit on those older filesystems".
</p>

<p>
This is another reason that the documentation should make it clear that
iomap is still being developed; the interfaces that eventually shake out
may be different than what is there today.  The documentation may change
over time because people are working to make it easier for filesystems to
use iomap, but that is still under construction.  "We shouldn't promise
that it is going to be easy, because it is not easy ... yet."
</p>

<p>
Support for the older filesystems is generally only needed to be able to
access the filesystems, Reinecke said; there is no real need to ensure that
they are particularly fast.  For things like VFAT or the ISO CD-ROM
filesystem, slowing them down slightly will not really be noticed; they
were slow to begin with, after all.  So he suggested not spending a lot of
time making things faster for those cases; "if you care, write a different
filesystem". 
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain noted that Kara had mentioned the <a
href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp">Linux Test Project</a>
(LTP) test suite as one that is good to use for testing these kinds of
changes, but wondered if there were others.  Kara said that there are
direct-I/O tests in fstests that can also be used.
</p>

<p>
There has been a lot of work done by Goldwyn Rodrigues on locking,
Chamberlain said, that needs to get into the kernel so that Btrfs can
convert more than just the direct-I/O path to iomap.  Rodrigues came in
remotely to say that the worst part of the problems he has been tackling,
extent locking within the page lock, is mostly working at this point,
though there are "a couple of hackish patches".  He is hoping
to get the
patch set out for review soon, which will presumably lead to some better
ideas for the hacks.
</p>

<p>
Kara reported to Harjani that he had just poked around in the code and did
not think the <tt>BH_Boundary</tt> flag will be much of a problem.  It is
meant to tell the block layer that the filesystem needs to submit the read
before it has the information to submit further reads, but iomap simply
returns each contiguous extent, so it implicitly handles that case.  Kara
said that Harjani can ignore the boundary-handling issue and "it will be
mostly fine".
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain closed the session by asking attendees, particularly those who
are working on converting filesystems to use iomap, to review the
documentation on the wiki.  He outlined how to get edit rights there and
suggested that developers simply reflect their comments in the wiki text
itself; in a kernel release or two, it could be submitted to the mainline.
An attendee said that "sooner is better", and others agreed, so Chamberlain
said that he would 
simply post it to the mailing list for review.

Heh, Reinecke feels just like me except I am working on qdiscs.<br>

The only documentation I’ve found begins with that “by now, everyone should be using the new kernel 2.0.33”, the netdev developers either don’t know themselves, don’t reply or actively wall off people.<br>

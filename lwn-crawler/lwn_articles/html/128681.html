<h1>Pluggable congestion avoidance modules</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Many years ago, when the TCP/IP protocols were young, the early Internet
went through a bad period.  As the number of systems on the net grew, the
high-speed (56K) long-haul links which tied the backbone sites together
became clogged and the net became very difficult to use.  The TCP
implementations in use at that time did not understand how to deal with (or
even detect) congestion, and, as a result, made the problem worse.  Some
people began to ask if TCP was going to work at all.
<p>
Van Jacobson  saved the situation with a simple observation:
there is no point in sending data faster than the slowest link between the
endpoints can handle it, even if the local network connection is very
fast.  Overwhelming the long-haul link just causes lots of dropped packets,
retransmissions, and even more congestion.  The solution was to start
transmitting data slowly on a new connection, then to ramp up the speed
until packets started getting dropped.  The optimal speed was deemed to be
one at which just a very small number of packets would fail to arrive.
That speed would be adjusted over the life of the connection as conditions
on the network changed.  With TCP tweaked in this way, communicating
systems would scale back their transmissions as the network got more
congested, but would ramp up when the bandwidth became available.  The
result was a net which actually worked for everybody involved.  It 
became possible, for example, to download the entire GNU emacs distribution
without having to split it into dozens of small pieces first.
<p>
We had to content ourselves with what we could get in those days.
<p>

Since then, the net has become much larger, more complex, and faster.  The
congestion avoidance problem has grown as well, to the point that there are
several competing algorithms seeking to provide the best TCP performance
while being fair to other network users.  Several of these algorithms have
found their way into Linux, with a corresponding increase in the complexity
of the TCP code.  As a way of helping those experimenting with congestion
avoidance and eliminating the need to patch the TCP code directly, Stephen
Hemminger has posted <a href="/Articles/128626/">a new infrastructure</a>
which allows congestion avoidance algorithms to be written as pluggable
modules.  He has also reworked the existing algorithms in the kernel to use
the new infrastructure.  The result is, among other things, an opportunity
to look at how these algorithms work.
<p>

The core of the TCP protocol is the concept of a "window," being the amount
of data which one side is willing to accept from the other at any given
time.  The window size reflects what the receiving system can handle - how
much buffer space it has available - but it says nothing about what the
routers in between can deal with.  Congestion avoidance algorithms try to
account for the slowest link serving a connection with a "congestion
window," which is the maximum amount of data which can be in transit
without an acknowledgment from the remote end.  An ideal congestion window
setting will allow a system to maximize throughput on a connection without
excessive packet loss rates, and without taking an unfair amount of the
shared network bandwidth.  Finding that setting is still more of an art
than a science.
<p>

Stephen's patches create a new structure to identify a congestion avoidance
algorithm:
<p>
<pre>
    struct tcp_ca_type {
	void (*start)(struct tcp_sock *tp);
	u32 (*ssthresh)(struct tcp_sock *tp);
	u32 (*min_cwnd)(struct tcp_sock *tp);
	void (*cong_avoid)(struct tcp_sock *tp, u32 ack, 
			   u32 rtt, u32 in_flight, int good);
	void (*rtt_sample)(struct tcp_sock *tp, u32 rtt);
	void (*set_state)(struct tcp_sock *tp, u8 new_state);

	void (*cwnd_event)(struct tcp_sock *tp, enum tcp_ca_event ev);
	u32  (*undo_cwnd)(struct tcp_sock *tp);
	void (*get_info)(struct tcp_sock *tp, u32 ext, struct sk_buff *skb);

	struct list_head	list;
	struct module 		*owner;
	const char 		*name;
    };
</pre>
<p>

Each of the methods in this structure is a hook into the TCP code which
allows the algorithm 
to obtain information on network conditions and react accordingly:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <tt>start()</tt> method initializes the algorithm when a new batch
     of data is being transmitted; this can happen for new sockets, or when
     one has been idle for a while.
<p>
<li> The <tt>ssthresh()</tt> method calculates the "slow
     start threshold"; when the congestion window is below that threshold, the
     connection is in slow start mode rather than full congestion avoidance
     mode.  This method is called when congestion occurs.
<p>
<li> The actual initial window may be set by <tt>min_cwnd()</tt> to be less
     than the threshold value as a starting point for the slow start
     algorithm.  
<p>
<li> When an acknowledgment arrives from the remote end, the
     <tt>cong_avoid()</tt> method is invoked; it may respond to successful
     packet delivery by enlarging the congestion window.  
<p>
<li> <tt>rtt_sample()</tt> tells the algorithm about a measured round-trip
     time - the time taken between sending a packet and receiving the
     corresponding acknowledgment. 
<p>
<li> <tt>set_state()</tt> indicates that the TCP state of the socket has
     changed.  
<p>
<li> Various events of interest can be communicated to the algorithm via
     <tt>cwnd_event()</tt>. 
<p>
<li> Sometimes, transient situations can cause the congestion window to be
     reduced; the <tt>undo_cwnd()</tt> method can be called when such a
     situation is detected to restore a larger window.  
<p>
<li> The <tt>get_info()</tt> method can be used to make congestion
     avoidance information available to user space.
</ul>
<p>

The TCP "Reno" algorithm is Van Jacobson's original; it remains wired into
the kernel in a non-pluggable form (though it can be overridden).  The
congestion window starts at the <tt>min_cwnd()</tt> value, and increases by
one segment for each sequential acknowledgment received from the remote
end until it hits the slow-start threshold.  At that point, the congestion
window increases much more slowly until it either hits the TCP window size
or packet loss happens.  When congestion is detected, the congestion window
is cut in half (to a minimum of two segments) and the process starts over.
<p>

The <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/NRL/hpi/tcpw/">Westwood</a> algorithm
is a tweak to the Reno approach.  The Westwood code carefully tracks the
round-trip times of the packets sent, and uses that information to estimate
the effective bandwidth of the network connection.  When packets get
dropped, the congestion window and slow start thresholds are set relative
to that bandwidth estimate.  As a result, Westwood tends to back off more
slowly than Reno, and should, thus, get better bandwidth overall.  Its
authors claim that Westwood is especially good for wireless links or other
situations where the loss of an occasional packet may have nothing to do
with congestion.
<p>

<a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/protocols/">TCP Vegas</a> also makes use
of detailed round-trip time information.  In particular, it tries to
address a perceived failure in the Reno algorithm, which determines the
optimal packet rate by increasing the congestion window until that rate is
exceeded.  Vegas, instead, monitors changes to the packet round-trip time
as the congestion window is increased.  If a larger window leads to longer
round-trip times, the algorithm concludes that congestion is about to set
in and the window is reduced slightly.  The Vegas algorithm (or at least
the Linux implementation thereof) does not perform well in all
environments, so it is not enabled by default.
<p>

<a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/rhee/export/bitcp.pdf">Binary
Increase Congestion Control (BIC) [PDF]</a> tries to be smarter about how
the congestion window size is adjusted.  Among other things, it is aimed at
high-performance networks where the TCP window may be quite large.  The
other algorithms may, in congestion avoidance mode, make large changes to
the congestion window which can result in abrupt increases in network
traffic.  The BIC code combines two algorithms as a way of trying to
quickly converge on the proper congestion window while avoiding massive
packet dumps.  The core technique is a binary search; if the window is to
be increased, the point midway between the current value and the maximum
size is chosen.  Decreases are handled by picking the midpoint between the
current value and the threshold.  If, however, the endpoints are too far
apart, an "additive increase" is done instead - the congestion window is
resized by a constant value.

<p>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3649.txt">High-speed
TCP</a> algorithm is optimized for very fat pipes - 10G Ethernet and such.
When things are congested, it behaves much like the Reno algorithm.  When
the congestion window is being increased, however, the high-speed algorithm
makes use of a table to pick large increment values.  This approach lets
the congestion window get very large (i.e. tens of thousands of segments)
quickly, and to stay large, without requiring that the network function for
long periods of time without a single dropped packet.
<p>

The last of the pluggable modules is the <a href="/Articles/124483/">TCP
Hybla</a> implementation.  Hybla is based on the observation that the other
algorithms, which use round-trip times heavily in their calculations, tend
to be biased against satellite links and other high-latency connections.
So Hybla includes a calculation which allows the congestion window to
become larger, more quickly, when the round-trip time is very high.  In
this way, it tries to keep the pipe full enough to make use of the
available bandwidth, even though the time to turn around any individual
packet is long.
<p>

Stephen is currently suggesting that this patch set should go into 2.6.13,
after a good shakedown period in the -mm tree.  There does not seem to be a
whole lot of opposition, so things may well happen just that way.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Are all these algorithms actually implemented in the proposed patch?  It could be interesting to <br>
play with, because it makes TCP a game.  Individual sysops may choose an algorithm that gives <br>
them a slight advantage while ruining aggregate performance.  That sounds pretty fun.<br>

      Yes, Stephen's patch include all of those algorithms - most of them are already in the kernel, he just repackaged them into modules.

      Indeed.  I had in mind to post something very similar.  Unlike some of the  <br>
other kernel articles, which sometimes go over my head (altho I'm sure  <br>
some find them as incredibly useful as I and apparently you found this, <br>
and if that someone is the guy/gal writing the driver for that peripheral <br>
I'm going to be buying...), this is exactly the type of thing that I can <br>
make use of, therefore, exactly the type of thing that I have in mind when <br>
it comes time to fill in that subscription reauthorization.  <br>

      <p>Agreed.  The explanations are very very good, and this is what sets LWN appart from the other publications.</p>
<p>As a side note, after reading the article, I tried to select Westwood instead of BIC (which the kernel selects by default as I compiled all of them in), and got instant higher TCP performance on a network with an WiFi backbone link.</p>

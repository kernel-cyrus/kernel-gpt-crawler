<p>
There are ways to get fixes into the stable kernel trees, but they
require humans to identify which patches should go there.  Sasha Levin and
Julia Lawall have taken a different approach: use machine learning to
distinguish patches that fix bugs from others.  That way, all bug-fix
patches could potentially make their way into the stable kernels.  Levin
and Lawall gave a talk describing their work at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/">2018
Open Source Summit North America</a> in Vancouver, Canada.
</p>

<p>
Levin began with a quick introduction to the stable tree and how patches
get into it.  When a developer fixes a bug in a patch they can add a
"stable tag" to the commit or send a mail to the <a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#stable">stable mailing
list</a>; Greg Kroah-Hartman will then pick up the fix, evaluate it, and
add it to the stable tree.
But that means that the stable tree is only getting the fixes that are
pointed out to the stable maintainers.  No one has time to check all of the
commits to the kernel for bug fixes but, in an ideal world, all of the bug
fixes would go into the stable kernels.  Missing out on some fixes means
that the stable trees will have more security vulnerabilities because the
fixes often close those holesâ€”even if the fixer doesn't realize it.
</p>

</a>

<p>
But the stable tags are not that effective as a way to communicate bug
fixes, Levin said.  Patch authors are often unsure whether a patch is
stable material and sometimes a patch is not stable material when it is
written, but is at the time it gets merged.  Beyond that, various
subsystems have different rules about marking patches for stable; the USB
subsystem expects authors to add the stable tag, while, in the networking
subsystem, stable tags are all added by David Miller.  Levin estimates that
only half of the patches that fix bugs actually get marked for the stable
kernels. 
</p>

<p>
"Hey, we have that Greg guy, let's make him look at all the commits", he
said with a chuckle.  In truth, that is not even remotely possible.  It
takes at least a minute or two to look at a patch and see if it is relevant
for stable.  There are so many commits, all over the kernel, that jumping
around to various subsystems looking at them all is mentally exhausting.
With 14,000 commits per release, even a minute and a half per patch would
result in 350 hours of patch review.  When Levin does patch review for the
stable tree, he
limits himself to doing so an hour at a time, otherwise he "would go crazy".
</p>

<p>
One obvious solution would be to automate the process somehow.  In order to
do that, you need to figure out what indicates that a patch might be a bug
fix.  There is no big flag, instead there are many small things that are
indicative of the right kind of patch.  There are often hints in the commit
message or code constructs (e.g. adding a <tt>spin_unlock()</tt>) that
would lead one toward the "fix" classification.  There are also clues in
the subsystem that the patch applies to and the author of the patch; some
subsystems are in maintenance mode, so they mostly only get fixes, while
some authors tend toward bug fixing.
</p>

<p>
He gave some examples.  A commit message that has strings like "bug",
"fixes", or "memory leak" are prime candidates.  Adding unbalanced locking,
a test for null, or an additional branch or return would be indicators as
well.   Certain bots, such as syzbot or the 0day bot,  are likely to have
reported bugs that need fixing; he has seen lots of commits that reference
syzbot, 
but not stable, he said.
</p>

<h4>Building a neural net</h4>

<p>
So he decided to build a neural network to see what it could do to classify
patches.  He started out "not knowing anything", so he took a somewhat naive
approach.  He took the most common 10,000 words in kernel commit messages
and tagged which of those were in a candidate patch.  That was one of the
inputs;
others were information on code metrics for the changes in the commit,
author information (in the hopes that it matters somewhat, he said), the
involved parties (reviewers, committers), and which files were modified.
Some files tend to have more fixes than others; files with hardware quirks
or PCI IDs are trivial examples of that.
</p>

<p>
He then trained the neural network with commits from Linux&nbsp;3.0
to&nbsp;4.16, where the "true" value was whether the commit was in the
stable tree.  He started off training it on his laptop, but that took too
long, so he switched to a "beefy GPU" provided by his employer, Microsoft.
It took about a month to train the model down to less than a 5% error
rate.  That cost about $2000 for the month.
</p>

<p>
The results have been good; it is far easier to look at 1000 commits,
rather than 14,000.  The output from the neural network has led to more than
3000 commits to various stable trees, many of which were critical fixes.
Many of those do not have CVE numbers associated with them, Levin said,
because he believes that people only get CVEs for publicity purposes.  The
number of rejections and reversions among the patches identified by the
system is comparable to that of the commits tagged by humans for stable.
</p>

<p>
There are some imperfections in the system.  It can identify bug fixes, but
it cannot determine whether the fix is relevant to a particular kernel
version.  In addition, there are lots of fixes that didn't go into the
stable treeâ€”part of the reason behind this projectâ€”which means that the
training data is not perfect.  Beyond that, there is no universal
definition of what a "bug" is; people can look at the same "fix"
and disagree on whether it even <i>is</i> a bug fix.
</p>

<h4>Neural network background</h4>
<p>
With that, Lawall took over to try to fill in some of the background of
neural networks to explain what Levin has done and how these networks apply
to the problem of bug-fix 
identification.  She is not a neural network expert, she said, but has been
looking into the topic of late.
Lawall also reported on the results of some of the related
research she has been doing recently.  
</p>

<a href="/Articles/764651/">

</a>

<p>
She started, like Levin, by identifying the features of a patch that might
lead a human to suspect they fix a bug.  That includes commit message
clues, developers involved, and the code changes made.  Once these things
have been identified, though, some kind of weight needs to be assigned to
them.  For example, having "bug" or "fix" in the commit message could be
given a weight of 0.3, the commit coming from a well-known developer might
be given a weight of 0.2, and a locking or null-test change might get a
weight of 0.4.  Those weights would be applied to values that score the
commit's characteristics based on the criteria (so, for example,
"well-known" could have a score that ranked developers).  The weights are
multiplied by the score and added up to give a confidence value that a
commit fixes a bug; choosing a cut-off for the confidence value results in
a yes or a no answer for a given patch.
</p>

<p>
But the weighting values are arbitrary; should "bug" or "fix" in the commit
message be 0.28 or 0.1, perhaps?  The original 0.3 value was set based on
intuition, not rigorous testing.  In addition, well-known developers do a
lot of different things, not just fixes; should the calculation really be
taking both of those into account?  Maybe it is only if a well-known
developer made a commit with "fix" in it that should be scored highly.
</p>

<p>
So there is a need to optimize the weighting values and to take
combinations of features into account.  That is where a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network">feedforward
neural network</a> can come into play.  These networks are organized with
three layers: input, hidden, and output.  The layer organization is a way
of describing 
the formula for making the decision; there are weights associated with each
of the steps in the paths through the network.  But where do <i>those</i>
weights come from?
</p>

<p>
The weights come from the training process.  Data that has results
with expected values can be used to "back-propagate" weights in order to
tune the model.  Training is a process of "moving in some direction in our
weight space" to produce better results, Lawall said.  It is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill-climbing
problem</a> where each iteration tries to improve on the last.  At some
point, she said, you decide that the error is small enough and stop.
</p>

<h4>Improvements?</h4>

<p>
That is what Levin has done; she wondered what could be done to improve on
that.  The features that Levin chose were fairly arbitrary: maybe the
author is important, but maybe not.  Perhaps there are other features of
the patches that are not being used but would produce better results.  In
addition, how can the neural network be trained to reason about code?  The code
features that Levin uses are coarse-grained, but fine-grained code features
may be too costly to work with.
</p>

<p>
She and her co-researchers have been looking at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional
neural networks</a> (CNNs), which have traditionally been used in image
processing.  More recently, they have been used for natural language
processing.  In order to use them on code, though, the important features of
code need to be identified.  There is a temptation to add more and more
features in order to ensure that the right ones are present, but each
feature adds to the search space, thus to the cost of training and
optimizing the network. 
</p>

<p>
A CNN has the concept of a filter that can be applied to the data to find
where it matches best.  You can start with a random filter or one based on
intuition about the features of interest; then the training optimizes those
filters. That can lead to a smaller set of features due to filters being
discarded or combined in the process.
</p>

<p>
For a patch, there are really two pieces: the commit message and the actual
code changes.  The commit message is English text, so strategies for
processing natural language can be applied.  Code is trickier; the
representation of code changes needs to be worked out.  She gave an example
change:
<pre>
    -       if (cpuidle_sysfs_monitor.hw_states_num == 0)
    +       if (cpuidle_sysfs_monitor.hw_states_num &lt;= 0)
                    return NULL;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In that change, there is only one character different (<tt>&lt;</tt>
instead of <tt>=</tt>) but that may not be the right level to look at it.
The <tt>==</tt> operator has changed to <tt>&lt;=</tt>, which is a
token-level change.  That may still be too low-level for distinguishing
fixes.  Other options would be the whole "atomic statement" (the
<tt>if</tt> line) or the full statement (the <tt>if</tt> and the
<tt>return</tt>).   They decided to go with the atomic statement option.  
</p>

<p>
Once that was decided, there is still more to determine.  How do you break
down the <tt>if</tt> line in a way that allows the model to generalize
changes of this sort?  What specific pieces of the line should be retained
and which should be generalized?  For the most part, they have decided to
keep the C language pieces (e.g. <tt>if</tt>, <tt>(</tt>, <tt>.</tt>,
<tt>==</tt>), while generalizing the identifiers and value (so
<tt>hw_states_num</tt> and <tt>cpuidle_sysfs_monitor</tt> are simply
identifiers, while <tt>0</tt> is an 
integer).   Those may not be the best choices, but that is what they are
working with currently.  Representing commits, with multiple hunks of
added and removed lines, will
require multiple neural networks, she said; that is a work in progress.
</p>

<p>
The resulting neural network is called PatchNet.  They did some comparative
testing between PatchNet, Levin's method, and a simple keyword check for
"bug" or "fix" in the commit message.  They took around 80K commits from
Linux 3.0 to 4.12 that were roughly balanced between stable and non-stable
commits. Levin took their data set and trained it
using his methods. They then calculated two metrics for each. "Precision"
measures 
the percentage of patches classified as stable by the model or test that
were actually in the stable kernels.  "Recall" measures the percentage of
patches in the stable kernels that were classified as bug fixes by the
three systems.
</p>

<p>
The results were interesting, but somewhat inconclusive at this point.   As
might be guessed, the simple bug/fix test did not 
fare as well as either of the other two.  For precision, Levin's model and
PatchNet were essentially equal at around 85%.  For recall, however,
PatchNet came it at around 90%, while Levin's model was about 80%.
PatchNet is better than Levin's technique at recognizing the full-breadth
of patches in the stable tree, though it is far from clear to me
how that 
might be used in the future.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of other things that can be tried, Lawall said; it is early
in the exploration of this technique.  She and her team have
made various choices, some of which may be good or bad; some experimentation
with different choices seems warranted.  The weighting in a neural network is
reputed to be hard to understand, but it might be worth trying to peer inside
these models to see if anything useful can be gleaned to improve their
results.   Other areas for fruitful research might be choosing which stable
versions a patch applies to or to identify bug-introducing patches.

This is a very interesting use case for neural networks. It would be interesting to know the size of the training dataset (number of rows and number of features), the network architecture (number of hidden layers, number of units in each layer, ..), the hardware resources and the GPU configuration. The reason I'm asking is the very long training time, 1 month..<br>
Thanks!<br>

Thanks for explaining the details of the NN architecture.<br>
<p>
I'm no ML expert, but have played around with some algorithms including neural networks. Based on the little understanding I've gathered along the way, this architecture seems more than a little overkill for the task. In particular the hidden layer is pretty huge. I assume that all input neurons are connected to every hidden layer neuron, as in a typical feed-forward network. Then you will be calculating more than 900 million weights! No wonder it took that long. <br>
<p>
Are you sure you really need such a big hidden layer? In my understanding, the hidden layer size is typically somewhere around midway (in terms of magnitude, not necessarily absolute value) between the input layer and output layer sizes. The idea is that the hidden layer will try to generalize and find patterns in the input, for example identifying inputs that are correlated or whose relationship is important.<br>
<p>
Have you tried a smaller hidden layer? I would try this with a hidden layer of size 1000 or so, perhaps even just 100. That could be easily tested on a laptop. You could even omit the hidden layer completely, which amounts to linear optimization and is not as powerful as a real neural network, but might still work fine in this case.<br>

Patches come as e-mails. Spamassassin takes e-mails and scores them. I'm *so* tempted to see what would happen if I trained Spamassassin, especially its Bayesian component, in this way. <br>

I have been bitten multiple times by "fixes" being backported to -stable that actually caused regressions instead.  Here is one example:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&amp;m=152227354106242">https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&amp;m=152227354106242</a><br>
<p>
In this case, a bad "cleanup" patch introduced numerous bugs (including CVE-2017-14991) into mainline, and was followed by several different patches to fix the bugs it introduced.  I guess someone wanted to backport the CVE fix to -stable (even though -stable wasn't affected), but since the CVE fix depended on the bad "cleanup" patch that introduced the problem, the bad "cleanup" patch was backported also, along with the additional bugs that it brought with it.  But one of the additional bugs went unfixed in -stable for several months until I pointed it out.  Of course the bad "cleanup" patch is what introduced the CVE to begin with, so it would have been better if none of the patches had been backported.  But figuring that out requires a person to actually read the code, understand it, and make a judgment about it, whereas we seem to be headed in the opposite direction.<br>

I'm slightly confused by your conclusion. From what I can tell, the commit you pointed out was backported by a human (Greg KH) without any input from this automatic process.<br>
<p>
How did you reach the conclusion that automatic process is bad from the above?<br>

Thanks for taking the time to look at my example.  In this case you are probably correct, a very intelligent but overworked human made a mistake; happens to us all (and I certainly do appreciate your work and Greg KH's too).  It is certainly true that your automatic process will backport many fixes that humans would have missed.  But it is also true that backporting more patches will cause more regressions.  This is true whether the backporting is automatic or not.  It appears that you are already familiar with this risk: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/692866/">https://lwn.net/Articles/692866/</a><br>
<p>
So here's an idea for your next project.  Track all the regressions introduced by -stable patches and see if you can use machine learning to prevent future regressions.  Now *that* would be awesome.<br>

Indeed, it would be useful to catch buggy patches early on.<br>

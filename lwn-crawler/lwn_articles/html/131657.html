Now that BitKeeper is no more, how will the kernel development process
function?  In the short term, the answer is "painfully."  The rest of the
2.6.12 process looks like the good old days: patches emailed to Linus, who
will apply them (hopefully) and occasionally release a snapshot tree.  That
mode might work for the short term, since only bug fixes should be merged
before 2.6.12 comes out, but nobody wants to try to run the process that
way for any period of time.  The kernel team needs much better patch and
workflow support if it is going to sustain a reasonable development pace.
So a replacement for BitKeeper will have to come from somewhere.
<p>

For a while, the leading contender appeared to be <a
href="http://www.venge.net/monotone/">monotone</a>, which supports the
distributed development model used with the kernel.  There are some issues
with monotone, however, with performance being at the top of the list:
monotone simply does not scale to a project as large as the kernel.  So
Linus has, in classic form, gone off to create something of his own.  The
first version of the tool called "git" was <a
href="/Articles/131312/">announced</a> on April&nbsp;7.  Since then, the
tool has progressed rapidly.  It is, however, a little difficult to
understand from the documentation which is available at this point.  Here's
an attempt to clarify things.
<p>

Git is <i>not</i> a source code management (SCM) system.  It is, instead, a
set of low-level utilities (Linus compares it to a special-purpose
filesystem) which can be used to construct an SCM system.  Much of the
higher-level work is yet to be done, so the interface that most developers
will work with remains unclear.  
<p>
At the lower levels,
Git implements two data structures: an object database, and a directory
cache.  The <b>object database</b> can contain three types of objects:
<p>
<ul>

<li> <b>Blobs</b> are simply chunks of binary data - they are the contents 
     of files.  One blob exists in the object database for every revision
     of every file that git knows about.  There is no direct connection
     between a blob and the name (or location) of the file which contains
     that blob.  If a file is renamed, its blob in the object database
     remains unchanged.
<p>
<li> <b>Trees</b> are a collection of blobs, along with their file names
     and permissions.  A tree object describes the state of a directory
     hierarchy at a particular given time.
<p>
<li> <b>Commits</b> (or "changesets") mark points in the history of a tree;
     they contain a log message, a tree object, and pointers to one or more
     "parent" commits (the first commit will have no parent).
</ul>
<p>

The object database relies heavily on SHA hashes to function.  When an
object is to be added to the database, it is hashed, and the resulting
checksum (in its ASCII representation) is used as its name in the database
(almost - the first two bytes of the checksum are used to spread the files
across a set of directories for efficiency).  Some developers have
<a href="/Articles/131752/">expressed concerns</a> about hash collisions,
but that possibility does not seem to worry the majority.  The object itself is
compressed before being checksummed and stored.

<p>

It's worth repeating that git stores every revision of an object separately
in the database, addressed by the SHA checksum of its contents.  There is
no obvious connection between two versions of a file; that connection is
made by following the commit objects and looking at what objects were
contained in the relevant trees.  Git might thus be expected to consume a
fair amount of disk space; unlike many source code management systems, it
stores whole files, rather than the differences between revisions.  It is,
however, quite fast, and disk space is considered to be cheap.

<p>
The <b>directory cache</b> is a single, binary file containing a tree object; it
captures the state of the directory tree at a given time.  The state as
seen by the cache might not match the actual directory's contents; it could
differ as a result of local changes, or of a "pull" of a repository from
elsewhere. 

<p>

If a developer wishes to create a repository from scratch, the first step
is to run <tt>init-db</tt> in the top level of the source tree.
People running PostgreSQL want to be sure not to omit the hyphen, or they
may not get the results they were hoping for.  <tt>init-db</tt> will create
the directory cache file (<tt>.dircache/index</tt>); it will also, by
default, create the object database in <tt>.dircache/objects</tt>.  It is
possible for the object database to be elsewhere, however, and possibly
shared among users.  The object database will initially be empty.
<p>

Source files can be added with the <tt>update-cache</tt> program.
<tt>update-cache&nbsp;--add</tt> will add blobs to the object database for new
files and create new blobs (leaving the old ones in place) for any files which have changed.
This command will also update the directory cache with entries associating
the current files' blobs with their current names, locations, and
permissions. 
<p>

What <tt>update-cache</tt> will <i>not</i> do is capture the state of the
tree in any permanent way.  That task is done by <tt>write-tree</tt>, which
will generate a new tree object from the current directory cache and enter
that object into the database.  <tt>write-tree</tt> writes the SHA checksum
associated with the new tree object to its standard output; the user is
well-advised to capture that checksum, or the newly-created tree will be
hard to access in the future. 

<p>
The usual thing to do with a new tree object will be to bind it into a
commit object; that is done with the <tt>commit-tree</tt> command.
<tt>commit-tree</tt> takes a tree ID (the output from
<tt>write-tree</tt>) and a set of parent commits, 
combines them with the changelog entry, and stores the whole thing as a
commit object.  That object, in essence, becomes the head of the current
version of the source tree.  Since each commit points to its parents, the
entire commit history of the tree can be traversed by starting at the
head.  Just don't lose the SHA
checksum for the last commit. 
Since each commit contains a tree object,  the state of the source tree
at commit time can be reconstructed at any point.
<p>

The directory cache can be set to a given version of the tree by using
<tt>read-tree</tt>; this operation reads a tree object from the object
database and stores it in the directory cache, but does not actually change any files
outside of the cache.  From there, <tt>checkout-cache</tt> can be used make
the actual source tree look like the cached tree object.  The
<tt>show-diff</tt> tool prints the differences between the directory cache
and what's actually in the directory tree currently.  There is also a
<tt>diff-tree</tt> tool which can generate the differences between any two
trees.
<p>

An early example of what can be done with these tools can be had by playing
with the <a href="/Articles/131560/">git-pasky</a> distribution by Petr
Baudis.  Petr has layered a set of scripts over the git tools to create
something resembling a source management system.  The git-pasky
distribution itself is available as a network repository; running
"<tt>git&nbsp;pull</tt>" will update to the current version.  
<p>
A "pull"
operation, as implemented in git-pasky, performs these steps:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The current "head" commit for the local repository
     is found; git-pasky keeps the SHA checksum
     for the current commit in <tt>.dircache/HEAD</tt>.  
<p>
<li> The current head is obtained from the remote repository (using
     <tt>rsync</tt>) and compared with the local head.  If the two are the
     same, no changes have been made and the job is done.
<p>
<li> The remote object database is downloaded, again with <tt>rsync</tt>.
     This operation will add any new objects to the database.
<p>
<li> Using <tt>diff-tree</tt>, a patch from the previous (local) version to the
     current (remote) version is generated.  That patch is then applied to the
     current directory's contents.  The patch technique is used to help
     preserve, if possible, any local changes to the files.
<p>
<li> A call to <tt>read-tree</tt> updates the directory cache to match the
     current revision as obtained from the remote repository.
</ul>
<p>

Petr's version of git adds a number of other features as well.  It is a far
cry from a full-blown source code management system, since it lacks little
details like release tagging, merging, graphical interfaces, etc.  A
beginning structure is beginning to emerge, however.
<p>

When this work was begun, it was seen as a sort of insurance policy to be
used until a real 
source management system could be found.  There is a good chance, however,
that git will evolve into something with staying power.  It provides the
needed low-level functionality in a reasonably simple way, and it is
blindingly fast.  Linus <a href="/Articles/131669/">places a premium on
speed</a>: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	changeset boundary etc (and quite frankly, that's _fast_ for most
	SCM's around for a project the size of Linux), then a series of 250
	emails (which is not unheard of at all when I sync with Andrew, for
	example) takes two hours.
</div>
<p>
As if on cue, Andrew <a href="/Articles/131754/">announced</a> a set of 198
patches to be merged for 2.6.12:

</div>
<p>
If this test (and the ones that come after) goes well, and the resulting
system evolves to where it meets Linus's needs, he may be unlikely to
switch to yet another system in the future.  So git is worth watching; it
could develop into a powerful system in a hurry.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The road Linus has more or less laid out seems to be exactly the right thing to do too. I don't think it is a coincidence that Linus kicked off this project himself: it almost ensures that many talented people will want to be involved (by coding or reviewing) -- and that there is a sound base on which those people can build great SCM software.
<p>
Open Source in action, it is still amazing.

Yee-haa! 198 patches applied in less than 3 minutes. That's pretty exactly
the "one patch per second" I was aiming for (0.8 seconds per patch, so my
estimate from a few days ago of 0.75 was pretty much on the money).

	> du -sh .git

	111M    .git

ie we added 9MB of stuff from a set of emails that totaled a 859kB mbox.

So say an expansion of about 10x over the pure emailed patches. Which is 
not out-of-line with my expectations, but considering that you _could_ 
have just compressed the patches and thrown the headers away and you'd 
have gotten a 190kB archive of just pure patches, it's not like this is 
hugely space-efficient.

I don't think I ever claimed it would be ;)

Anyway, I'm not going to release this tree, because quite frankly I want 
to double-check that everything went right, and I want to re-base the 
archive on some more history than starting _purely_ from scratch in 
2.6.12-rc2 (maybe from 2.6.11), but in general it looks good. Now, if I 
can get the stupid merging going on, it will actually be _useful_ ;)

PS. Yes, the tree still builds after this exercise ;)

<p>
With the continued improvement in disk storage capacity, I'm sure you're right.  A related concern is network bandwidth.  Not everyone has or can have a high-speed link.
<p>
Here is Linus and Andrew's take on the subject:

Yes, that's within my mental envelope. I was estimating a 3-5GB git
archive for the last three years of BK work.

The good news is that the way git works, you really can put the old
history in "storage" - throw it away (and just rely on the distribution
meaning that it's _somewhere_ out there on the net) or write it on a DVD
and forgetting about it. Most people really only care about the last few 
months.

Is 2GB a year a lot? I think it's peanuts, but hey, I can fill up my whole 
disk with kernel trees, and I wouldn't feel it's wasted space. Others may 
have slightly different priorities ("hey, I could fit 5000 songs in 
there!")

      Hopefully, the system won't touch more history than is absolutely necessary, and it can be taught to only fetch from the home of the big disk the history it needs and doesn't have. That way, people will only download things that they actually need. Even if someone ends up with the complete history, 2GB/year is only 544 bps; so long as nobody has to wait for 5 GB to download at once, it's fine.<br>

      I fully disagree.<br>
<p>
It might be the right thing to do now because it's simpler to do, not because disk space is cheap. That is ALWAYS an excuse.<br>
<p>
It's OK if git is just a linux kernel specific tool. If someone wants to make a general SCM on it, I wouldn't even want to try if I know it doesn't even support "diff".<br>

      But in the context of source-code it's obviosuy true. Not nessecarily so for all other contexts.<p>

Source-code is *very* small and *very* compressible in relation to how much work it takes to produce it. If you invest a million dollars in developing some software over a year. *ALL* revisions of *ALL* files can still be stored, completely uncompressed for a storage-cost in the pennies-range.<p>

There ain't anyone seriously working on Kernel-development that has a problem storing 10 or 100GB in order to do so efficiently. And hardisks are less than a dollar/GB.

      hmm, I've done some calculations before on checking out all revisions of all data I keep in my subversion repositories. IIRC, checking out all versions of all files in my ~3 gb of repositories would need closer to 1 terabyte of data than 100 gb. Not very practical for laptop use. :-)<br>

      You cannot just multiply the number of revisions by the number of files unless you change all files in every revision.  The files that don't change between revisions are not stored as separate copies (because their SHA1 checksum is the same).  In fact, if you revert to original file contents, the repository would be reusing the old files.

I have not been able to find out how to commit and push a hook to my git server archive for everyone's benefit.  The githooks man page does not descrive this and I have not turned up any fruitful google searches on the topic.<br>
<p>
I am trying to add a post-checkout hook.  I also noticed that the post-checkout sample does not exist when I init a new archive.  I am running git version 1.6.0.2.<br>

You can't push hooks, just as with everyting else under .git/: it would be <br>
dangerous, if you think about it, because hooks are executable code!<br>

You have to use some other mechanism (ssh, whatever) to install it at the <br>

      What a sucker, this Linus guy.<br>
<p>
I mean: for years, he's been ignoring the free SCM, on the grounds that they "didn't scale" for such a large project as the kernel. When he finally is bitten, he still scorns the alternatives, and comes up with a downgraded monotone sketch.<br>
Being something of a rockstar, he'll get away with it, and will get enough developper support because people must still be able to talk to his tree; but in terms of development time, he's just throwing others' work out of the window.<br>

      Hmm, if it takes Linus two hours to merge a patch-bomb, I think he has put less time into developing this new foundation for an SCM - than he would have been spending waiting for one of the existing SCMs merging his patches over the next month or two.<br>
<p>
Others are spending time inventing fancy algos, theories, and such, but fail on the real-world test. Why should Linus not scratch this desperate itch then? Why should he come to an existing project, and overturn it with his rather extreme demands? Does he have the time to wait for one of them to "grow up"? I think not. Remember that he is working full time, whereas many contributors to smaller projects are programming in their spare time. Thus, waiting on the spare-time programmers would be rather frustrating.<br>
<p>
So, it's not a question about Linus being a rock star. It's a question of efficiency.<br>

      the other projects have had three years to develop a better SCM solution.<br>
<p>
as Linux pointed out in the announcement that he was going to look at other options for SCM they aren't useable yet for something the size of the kernel yet.<br>
<p>
we'll see if git ends up beng a dead-end system or the base for a better system in the future, but it has a very different focus then the other SCM options.<br>
<p>
every one of the other options is starting with what the UI is, what commands the scm will implement. git is starting from the other direction and building the low-level pices (and building them to be fast) and then layering the UI on top of that.<br>
<p>
this seems like a much better approach to take, and the other SCM systems can take advantage of these primitives as well (assuming they are willing to live with a linux-only limitation or the slowdown from other systems that don't have some of the underlying infrastructure that git is counting on in the OS for it's speed)<br>

      At first, I thought Linus was wasting his time (and that of others) on git. It is still possible that he is, but if he really has found a super-simple alternative to the complexity of other distributed SCM systems, then he has really achieved something remarkable. Sometimes it takes an outsider to see what the experts overlook.<br>
<p>
If (almost) anyone else had pitched this idea to him, I doubt Linus would have paid any attention. If (almost) anyone else had come up with git, they would not have immediately attracted a community of developers to help build it. Linus also has the advantage of targeting a single workflow process within a single project. That's far easier than creating a generic tool.<br>
<p>
If someone can wrap a true, minimal but functional generic SCM around this thing, I will try it. I like minimalist simplicity. We should know within a few weeks whether the fundamental ideas are a good foundation, or have dead-end limitations. At the moment, I'm betting it will work.<br>
<p>
One other thing: I wish the authors of the various free distributed SCM's could gather to critique git's future possibilities. Assuming they could set aside their own biases, they are in the best position to point out limitations and guide the design.<br>

With six years' perspective, this comment is quite amusing. Most of the core of git is unchanged from this earliest sketch: one thing has been renamed (cache -&gt; index), but the only major new concept is packfiles, which have zero impact on anything but disk space.<br>
<p>
I think we can say that git is by now more than a 'downgraded monotone sketch' :)<br>

      I guess you need to define _GNU_SOURCE for the st_* fields and include unistd.h for missing declarations.  Userspace programming with all those compatibility issues is so much harder than the kernel, it's it? i:-)

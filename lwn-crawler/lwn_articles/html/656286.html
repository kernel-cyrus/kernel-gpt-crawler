           <p>September 2, 2015</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Joël Porquet</p>
           </div>
<p>In <a href="/Articles/654783/">part 1</a> of this series, we laid the groundwork for porting Linux to a new processor
architecture by explaining the (non-code-related) preliminary steps. This
article continues from there to delve into the boot code. This includes
what code needs to be written
in order to get from the early assembly boot code to the creation of the
first kernel thread.</p>

<h4>The header files</h4>

<p>As briefly mentioned in the previous article, the <code>arch</code> header files (in my
case, located under <code>linux/arch/tsar/include/</code>) constitute the two interfaces
between the architecture-specific and architecture-independent code required by Linux.</p>

<p>The first portion of these headers (subdirectory <code>asm/</code>) is part of the kernel
interface and is used internally by the kernel source code. The second portion
(<code>uapi/asm/</code>) is part of the user interface and is meant to be exported to
user space—even though the various standard C libraries tend to
reimplement the headers instead of including the exported ones. These interfaces
are not completely airtight, as many of the <code>asm</code> headers are
used by user space.</p> 

<p>Both interfaces are typically more than a hundred header files altogether,
which is why headers represent one of the biggest tasks in porting Linux to a
new processor architecture. Fortunately, over the past few years,
developers noticed 
that many processor architectures were sharing similar code (because they often
exhibited the same behaviors), so the majority of this code has been
aggregated
into a <a href="/Articles/333569/">generic layer of header files</a> (in
<code>linux/include/asm-generic/</code> and <code>linux/include/uapi/asm-generic/</code>).</p>

<p>The real benefit is that it is possible to refer to these generic header files,
instead of providing custom versions, by simply writing appropriate <code>Kbuild</code>
files. For example, the few first lines of a typical <code>include/asm/Kbuild</code> looks
like:</p>

<pre>
    generic-y += atomic.h
    generic-y += barrier.h
    generic-y += bitops.h
    ...
</pre>

<p>When porting Linux, I'm afraid there is no other choice than to make a list of
all of the possible headers and examine them one by one in order to decide
whether the generic version can be used or if it requires customization. Such a
list can be created from the generic headers already provided by Linux as well
as the customized ones implemented by other architectures.</p>

<p>Basically, a specific version must be developed for all of the headers that are related to the details of an
architecture, as defined by the hardware or by the software through the ABI: cache (<code>asm/cache.h</code>) and TLB management
(<code>asm/tlbflush.h</code>), the ELF format (<code>asm/elf.h</code>), interrupt enabling/disabling
(<code>asm/irqflags.h</code>), page table management (<code>asm/page.h</code>, <code>asm/pgalloc.h</code>,
<code>asm/pgtable.h</code>), context switching (<code>asm/mmu_context.h</code>, <code>asm/ptrace.h</code>), byte
ordering (<code>uapi/asm/byteorder.h</code>), and so on.</p>

<h4>Boot sequence</h4>

<p>As explained in part 1, figuring out the boot sequence helps to
understand the 
minimal set of architecture-specific functions that must be implemented—and in which
order.</p>

<p>The boot sequence always starts with a function that must be written manually,
usually in assembly code (in my case, this function is called <code>kernel_entry()</code> and
is located in <code>arch/tsar/kernel/head.S</code>). It is defined as the main entry
point of the kernel image, which indicates to the bootloader where to jump
after loading the image in memory.</p>

<p>The following trace shows an excerpt of the sequence of functions that
is executed during the boot (starred functions are the architecture-specific ones that
will be discussed later in this article):</p>

<pre>
    kernel_entry*
    start_kernel
        setup_arch*
        trap_init*
        mm_init
            mem_init*
        init_IRQ*
        time_init*
        rest_init
            kernel_thread
            kernel_thread
            cpu_startup_entry
</pre>

<h4>Early assembly boot code</h4>

<p>The early assembly boot code has this special aura that scared me at first (as
I'm sure it did many other programmers), since it is often considered one of the
most complex pieces of code in a port. But even though writing assembly
code is usually not an easy ride, this early boot code is not magic. It is
merely a trampoline to the first architecture-independent C function and,
to this end, 
only needs to perform a short and defined list of tasks.</p>

<p>When the early boot code begins execution, it knows nothing about what has
happened before: Has the system been rebooted or just been powered on?
Which bootloader has just loaded 
the kernel in memory? And so forth.  For this reason, it is safer to put
the processor into
a known state. Resetting one or several system registers usually does the trick,
making sure that the processor is operating in kernel mode with interrupts
disabled.</p>

<p>Similarly, not much is known about the state of the memory. In particular, there
is no guarantee that the portion of memory representing the kernel’s <code>bss</code>
section (the section containing uninitialized data) was reset to zero, which is why
this section must be explicitly cleared.</p>

<p>Often Linux receives arguments from the bootloader (in the same way that a
program receives arguments when it is launched). For example, this could be the memory address
of a <a href="http://www.devicetree.org/">flattened device tree</a> (on
ARM, MicroBlaze, openRISC, etc.) or some
other architecture-specific structure.
Often such arguments are passed using registers and need to be
saved into proper kernel variables.</p>

<p>At this point, virtual memory has not been activated and it is interesting
to note that kernel symbols, which are all defined in the kernel's virtual
address space, have to be accessed through a special macro: <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/kernel/head_32.S?v=4.2#L28"><code>pa()</code></a> in
x86, <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/openrisc/kernel/head.S?v=4.2#L32"><code>tophys()</code></a> in OpenRISC, etc. Such a macro translates the
virtual memory address for symbols into their corresponding physical memory
address, thus acting as a temporary software-based translation mechanism.</p>

<p>Now, in order to enable virtual memory, a page table structure must be set
up from scratch. This structure usually exists as a static variable in the
kernel image, since at this stage it is nearly impossible to allocate
memory. For the same reason, only the kernel image can be mapped by the page 
table at first, using huge pages if possible. According to convention, this
initial page table structure is called <code>swapper_pg_dir</code>     and is
thereafter used as the reference page table structure throughout the execution
of the system.</p>

<p>On many processor architectures, including TSAR, there is an interesting
thing about 
mapping the kernel in that it actually needs to be mapped twice. The first
mapping implements the expected direct-mapping strategy as described in part 1
(i.e.  access to virtual address <code>0xC0000000</code> redirects to physical address
<code>0x00000000</code>). However, another mapping is temporarily required for when
virtual memory has just been enabled but the code execution flow still hasn't
jumped to a virtually mapped location. This second mapping is a simple identity
mapping (i.e. access to virtual address <code>0x00000000</code> redirects to physical
address <code>0x00000000</code>).</p>

<p>With an initialized page table structure, it is now possible to enable
virtual memory, meaning that the kernel is fully executing in the virtual
address 
space and that all of the kernel symbols can be accessed normally by their name,
without having to use the translation macro mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>One of the last steps is to set up the stack register with the address of the
initial kernel stack so that C functions can be properly called. In most
processor architectures (SPARC, Alpha, OpenRISC, etc.), another register is also
dedicated to containing a pointer to the current thread's information (<code>struct
thread_info</code>). Setting up such a pointer is optional, since it can
be derived from the current kernel stack pointer (the <code>thread_info</code> structure is
usually located at the bottom of the kernel stack) but, when allowed by the
architecture, it enables much faster and more convenient access.</p>

<p>The last step of the early boot code is to jump to the first
architecture-independent C function that Linux provides: <code>start_kernel()</code>.</p>

<h4>En route to the first kernel thread</h4>

<p><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/init/main.c?v=4.2#L497"><code>start_kernel()</code></a> is where many subsystems are initialized, from
the various virtual filesystem (VFS) caches and the security framework to time
management, the console layer, and so on. Here, we will look at the main
architecture-specific 
functions that <code>start_kernel()</code> calls during boot before it
finally calls <code>rest_init()</code>, which creates the 
first two kernel threads and morphs into the boot idle thread.</p>

<h4><code>setup_arch()</code></h4>

<p>While it has a rather generic name, <code>setup_arch()</code>
can actually do quite a bit, 
depending on the architecture. Yet examining the code for different ports
reveals that it generally performs the same tasks, albeit never in the same
order nor the same way. For a simple port (with device tree support), there is a
simple skeleton that <code>setup_arch()</code> can follow.</p>

<p>One of the first steps is to discover the memory ranges in the system.
A device-tree-based system can quickly skim through the flattened device
tree given by the bootloader (using <code>early_init_devtree()</code>) to
discover the 
physical memory banks available and to register them into the
<code>memblock</code> layer. Then, parsing the early
arguments (using <code>parse_early_param()</code>) that were either given
by the bootloader or 
directly included in the device tree can activate useful features such as
<code>early_printk()</code>. The order is important here, as the device
tree might contain the 
physical address of the terminal device used for printing and thus needs to be
scanned first.</p>

<p>Next the memblock layer needs some more configuration before it is
possible to 
map the low memory region, which enables memory to be
allocated. First, the regions of memory occupied by the kernel image and the
device tree are set as being <em>reserved</em> in order to remove them from the pool of
free memory, which is later released to the buddy allocator. The boundary
between low memory and high memory (i.e. which portion of the physical memory
should be included in the direct mapping region) needs to be determined.
Finally the page table structure can be cleaned up (by removing the identity
mapping created by the early boot code) and the low memory mapped.</p>

<p>The last step of the memory initialization is to configure the memory
zones. Physical memory pages can be associated with different zones: <code>ZONE_DMA</code>
for pages compatible with the old ISA 24-bit DMA address limitation, and
<code>ZONE_NORMAL</code> and 
<code>ZONE_HIGHMEM</code> for low- and high-memory pages, respectively. Further reading on
memory allocation in Linux can be found in <a href="/images/pdf/LDD3/ch08.pdf"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em>
[PDF]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the kernel memory segments are registered using the resource
API and a tree of <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/of.h?v=4.2#L49"><code>struct&nbsp;device_node</code></a>
entries is created from the flattened device tree.</p>

<p>If <code>early_printk()</code> is enabled, here is an example of what
appears on the terminal at 
this stage:</p>

<pre>
    Linux version 3.13.0-00201-g7b7e42b-dirty (joel@joel-zenbook) \
        (gcc version 4.8.3 (GCC) ) #329 SMP Thu Sep 25 14:17:56 CEST 2014

    Built 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.  Total pages: 65024
    Kernel command line: console=tty0 console=ttyVTTY0 earlyprintk
</pre>

<h4><code>trap_init()</code></h4>

<p>The role of <code>trap_init()</code> is to configure the hardware and software
architecture-specific parts involved in the interrupt/exception infrastructure. Up to
this point, an exception would either cause the system to crash immediately or
it would be caught by a handler that the bootloader might have set up
(which would 
eventually result in a crash as well, but perhaps with more information).</p>

<p>Behind (the actually simple) <code>trap_init()</code> hides another of
the more complex 
pieces of code in a Linux port: the interrupt/exception handling manager. A big
part of it has to be written in assembly code because, as with the early boot
code, it deals with specifics that are unique to the targeted processor
architecture. On a typical processor, a possible overview of what happens on an
interrupt is as follows:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">
<li>The processor automatically switches to kernel mode, disables interrupts, and its execution flow is diverted to a
special address that leads to the main interrupt handler.</li>
<li>This main handler retrieves the exact cause of the interrupt and usually jumps
to a sub-handler specialized for this cause. Often an interrupt vector table
is used to associate an interrupt sub-handler with a specific cause, and on
some architectures there is no need for a main interrupt handler, as the
routing between the actual interrupt event and the interrupt vector is done
transparently by hardware.</li>
<li>The sub-handler saves the current context, which is the state of the
processor 
that can later be restored in order to resume exactly where it stopped. It may
also re-enable the interrupts (thus making Linux re-entrant) and usually jumps
to a C function that is better able to handle the cause of the exception.
For example, such a C function can, in the case of an access to an
illegal memory address, terminate the faulty user program with a <code>SIGBUS</code>
signal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all of this interrupt infrastructure is
in place, <code>trap_init()</code> merely 
initializes the interrupt vector table and configures the processor via one of
its system registers to reflect the address of the main interrupt handler (or
of the interrupt vector table directly).</p>

<h4><code>mem_init()</code></h4>

<p>The main role of <code>mem_init()</code> is to release the free memory from the
memblock layer to the buddy allocator (aka the <a href="/Articles/320556/">page
allocator</a>). This represents the last memory-related task before
the slab allocator (i.e. the cache of commonly used objects, accessible via
<code>kmalloc()</code>) and the vmalloc infrastructure can be started, as both are based on
the buddy allocator.</p>

<p>Often <code>mem_init()</code> also prints some information about the memory system:</p>

<pre>
    Memory: 257916k/262144k available (1412k kernel code, \
        4228k reserved, 267k data, 84k bss, 169k init, 0k highmem)
    Virtual kernel memory layout:
        vmalloc : 0xd0800000 - 0xfffff000 ( 759 MB)
        lowmem  : 0xc0000000 - 0xd0000000 ( 256 MB)
          .init : 0xc01a5000 - 0xc01ba000 (  84 kB)
          .data : 0xc01621f8 - 0xc01a4fe0 ( 267 kB)
          .text : 0xc00010c0 - 0xc01621f8 (1412 kB)
</pre>

<h4><code>init_IRQ()</code></h4>

<p>Interrupt networks can be of very different sizes and complexities. In a simple
system, the interrupt lines of a few hardware devices are directly connected to
the interrupt inputs of the processor. In complex systems, the numerous
hardware devices are connected to multiple programmable interrupt controllers
(PICs) and these PICs are often cascaded to each other, forming a
multilayer interrupt 
network. The device tree helps a great deal by easily describing such networks
(and especially the routing) instead of having to specify them directly in the
source code.</p>

<p>In <code>init_IRQ()</code>, the main task is to call
<code>irqchip_init()</code> in order to scan the device tree and find all
the nodes identified as interrupt controllers (e.g PICs). It then finds the
associated driver for each node and initializes it.  Unless the targeted system
uses an already-supported interrupt controller, that typically means
the first device driver will need to be written.</p>

<p>Such a driver contains a few major functions: an initialization
function that maps the device in the kernel address space and maps the
controller-local interrupt lines to the Linux IRQ  number space (through the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/IRQ-domain.txt"><code>irq_domain</code></a> mapping library); a mask/unmask function that can
configure the controller in order to mask or unmask the specified Linux IRQ
number; and, finally, a controller-specific interrupt handler that can find out
which of its inputs is active and call the interrupt handler registered with
this input (for example, this is how the interrupt handler of a block device
connected to a PIC ends up being called after the device has raised an
interrupt).</p>

<h4><code>time_init()</code></h4>

<p>The purpose of <code>time_init()</code> is to initialize the architecture-specific
aspects of the timekeeping infrastructure. A minimal version of this function,
which relies on the use of a device tree, only involves two function calls.</p>

<p>First, <code>of_clk_init()</code> will scan the device tree and find all the
nodes identified as clock providers in order to initialize the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/clk.txt">clock
framework</a>.  A very simple clock-provider node only has to define a fixed
frequency directly specified as one of its properties.</p>

<p>Then, <code>clocksource_of_init()</code> will parse the
clock-source
nodes of the device tree and initialize their associated driver. As described in
the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/timers/timekeeping.txt">kernel documentation</a>, Linux actually needs two types of timekeeping
abstraction (which are actually often both provided by the same device): a
clock-source device provides the basic timeline by monotonically counting
(for example 
it can count system cycles), and a clock-event device raises interrupts on
certain points on this timeline, typically by being programmed to count periods
of time. Combined with the clock provider, it allows for precise timekeeping.</p>

<p>The driver of a clock-source device can be extremely simple, especially for a
memory-mapped device for which the <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/clocksource/mmio.c">generic
MMIO clock-source driver</a>
only needs to know the address of the device register
containing the counter.  For the clock event, it is slightly more complicated as
the driver needs to define how to program a period and how to acknowledge it
when it is over, as well as provide an interrupt handler for when a timer
interrupt is raised.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>One of the main tasks performed by <code>start_kernel()</code> later on is to calibrate the
number of loops per jiffy, which is the number of times the processor can
execute 
an internal delay loop in one jiffy—an internal timer period that normally
ranges from one to ten milliseconds. Succeeding in performing this
calibration should mean 
that the different infrastructures and drivers set up by the architecture-specific
functions we just presented are working, since the calibration makes use of
most of 
them.</p>

<p>In the next article, we will present the last portion of the port: from the
creation of the first kernel thread to the <code>init</code> process.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

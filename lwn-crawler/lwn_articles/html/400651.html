<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 18, 2010</br>

<p>

Developers, understandably, want their code to be used, but turning
new features on by default is often thought to be taking things a bit too
far.  Herbert Xu and other kernel crypto subsystem developers recently ran
afoul of this policy when a new option controlling the
self-testing the crypto drivers at boot time was set to "yes" by default. 
They undoubtedly thought that this feature  was important&mdash;bad
cryptography 
can lead to system or data corruption&mdash;but Linux has a longstanding
policy that features should default to "off".  When David Howells ran
into a <a href="/Articles/400704/">problem</a> caused by a bug when loading
the cryptomgr module, Linus Torvalds was quick to sharply remind Xu of that
policy. 
</p>

<p>
The proximate cause of Howells's problem was that the cryptomgr was
returning a value that made it appear as if it was not loaded.  That caused
a cascade of problems early in the boot sequence when the module loader was
trying 
to write an error message to <tt>/dev/console</tt>, which had not yet been
initialized.  Xu sent out a <a href="/Articles/400720/">patch</a> to fix
that problem, but Howells's bisection pointed to a commit that added a way
to disable boot-time crypto self-tests&mdash;defaulted to running the
tests. 
</p>

<p>
Torvalds was characteristically <a href="/Articles/400721/">blunt</a>: "<q>People always think that their magical code is so important. I tell
you up-front that [it] absolutely is not. Just remove the crap entirely,
please.</q>"  He was unhappy that, at least by default, everyone would
be running these self-tests every time they boot.  But Xu was <a href="/Articles/400730/">worried</a>
about data corruption and potentially flaky crypto hardware:
<div class="BigQuote">
The purpose of these tests are to make a particular driver or
implementation available only if it passes them.  So your encrypted
disk/file system will not be subject to a hardware/software combo
without at least some semblance of testing.
<p>
The last thing you want to is to upgrade your kernel with a new
hardware crypto driver that detects that you have a piece of rarely-
used crypto [hardware], decides to use it and ends up making your
data toast.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Torvalds was <a href="/Articles/400734/">unconvinced</a>: "<q>The _developer_ had better test the thing. That is absolutely
_zero_ excuse for then forcing every boot for every poor user to re-do
the test over and over again.</q>".  Others were not so sure, however.
Kyle Moffett <a href="/Articles/400735/">noted</a> that he had been
personally bitten by new hardware crypto drivers that failed the
self-tests&mdash;thus falling back to the software implementation&mdash;so
he would like to see more testing:
<div class="BigQuote">
So there are unique and compelling reasons for default-enabled basic
smoke tests of cryptographic support during boot.  To be honest, the
test and integration engineer in me would like it if there were more
intensive in-kernel POST tests that could be enabled by a kernel
parameter or something for high-reliability embedded devices.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Basically Torvalds's point was that making every user pay the cost to run
the self-tests at boot time was too high.  The drivers <i>should</i> be
reliable or they shouldn't be in the kernel.  He <a
href="/Articles/400736/">continued</a>: "<q>And if you worry about alpha-particles, you should run a
RAM test on every boot. But don't ask _me_ to run one.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Though Xu posted a <a href="/Articles/400737/">patch</a> to default the
self-tests to "off", it has not yet made its way into the mainline.  Given
Torvalds's statements, though, that will probably happen relatively soon.
If distributions disagree with his assessment, they can, and presumably
will, enable the tests for their kernels.

I *do* run a (basic; it's the bios extended post-time check) ram test on every boot.  and I use ecc ram at the cost of speed (if a bit flips in a large data set, it doesn't matter how fast I can calculate it, it's still wrong)<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 20, 2010</br>
           </div>
Operating system kernels, at their best, should not be noticed by user
space at all; in particular, the resource cost of the kernel should be as
small as possible.  The Linux kernel has been written with that idea in
mind, but, for some people, anything is still too much.  High-performance
computing users want all of the CPU time for themselves, while some
latency-sensitive users want their code to never have to wait for the
processor.  These users have been asking for a way to run processes on at
least one CPU with no kernel interference at all - no timer ticks, no
interrupts, etc.  Thus far, no satisfactory solution has been found; a new
patch set by Frederic Weisbecker is not such a solution yet, but it shows
another way of attacking the problem.
<p>
The idea behind Frederic's <a href="/Articles/420490/">patch set</a> is to
enable a process to disable the timer interrupt while it is running.  If a
set of conditions can be met, this will allow the process to run without
regular interference from the timer tick.  If other sources of interrupts
are directed away from the CPU as well, this process should be able to run
uninterrupted for some time.  There are a few complications, though.
<p>
Actually going into the tickless mode is relatively easy; the process need
only write a nonzero value to <tt>/proc/self/nohz</tt>.  The patch imposes
a couple of conditions on these processes: (1)&nbsp;the process must be
bound to the 
CPU it is running on, and (2)&nbsp;no other process can be running in the
tickless mode on that CPU.  If those conditions hold, the write to
<tt>/proc/self/nohz</tt> will succeed and the kernel will try to disable
the timer tick while that process runs.
<p>
The key word here is "try"; there are a number of things which can keep the
disabling of the tick from happening.  The first of those is any sort of
contention for the CPU.  If any other processes are trying to run on the
same CPU, the scheduler tick must happen as usual so that decisions on
preemption can be made.  Since a process can be made runnable from anywhere
in the system, Frederic's patch performs a potentially expensive
inter-processor interrupt whenever the second process is made runnable on
any CPU, regardless of whether that CPU is currently running in the no-tick
mode or not.
<p>
Another thing that can gum up the works is read-copy-update (RCU).  If
there are any RCU callbacks which need to be processed on the CPU, that CPU
will not go into the no-tick mode.  RCU also needs to be notified whenever
the CPU goes into a "quiescent state," so that it can know when it is safe
to invoke RCU callbacks on other CPUs.  If RCU has indicated an interest in
knowing when the target CPU goes quiescent, once again, no-tick mode cannot
be entered.  The CPU can also be forced out of the no-tick mode if RCU
develops a curiosity about quiescent states anywhere in the system.
<p>
Given that RCU is heavily used in contemporary kernels, one would think
that its needs would prevent no-tick mode most of the time.  Another part
of the patch set tries to mitigate that problem with the realization that,
if a process is running in user space with the timer tick disabled, the
associated CPU is necessarily quiescent.  When a CPU is running in this
mode, it will enter an "extended quiescent state" which eliminates the need
for notification to the rest of the system.  The extended quiescent state
will probably increase the amount of no-tick time on a processor
considerably, but at a small cost: the architecture-level code must add
hooks to notify the no-tick code on every kernel entry and exit.
<p>
Reviews of the code, so far, have focused on various details which need to
be managed differently, but there has not been a lot of criticism of the
concept.  It's early-stage code, so it doesn't take care of everything that
normally happens during the timer tick, a fact which reviewers have pointed
out.  The biggest gripe, perhaps, has to do with the conditions
mentioned at the beginning of the article: the process must be bound to a
single CPU, and there can only be one no-tick process running on that CPU.
Peter Zijlstra <a href="/Articles/420548/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Well yes, this interface of explicitly marking a task and cpu as
	task_no_hz is kinda restrictive and useless.  When I run 4
	cpu-bound tasks on a quad-core I shouldn't have to do anything to
	benefit from this.
</div>
<p>
Frederic has indicated that the code can be changed to lift those
restrictions, but at the cost of some added complexity.  Once the
restrictions are gone, it may make sense to just enable the no-tick mode
whenever the workload is right for it, regardless of a request (or the lack
thereof) 
from any specific process.  That would make the no-tick mode more generally
useful; it would also reduce the role of the timer tick just a little
more.  The kernel would still be far from a fully tickless system, but
every step in that direction helps.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

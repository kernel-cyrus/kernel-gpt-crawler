<h1>iproute2 and libbpf: vendoring on the small scale</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 12, 2020</br>
           </div>
LWN's recent <a href="/Articles/835599/">article on Kubernetes in
Debian</a> discussed the challenges of packaging a massive project with
hundreds of dependencies.  Many of the issues that arose there, however,
are not limited to such projects, as can be seen in the ongoing discussion
about whether a copy of the relatively small <a
href="https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf">libbpf</a> library should be shipped
with the <a
href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2">iproute2</a>
collection of networking tools.  Fast-moving projects, it would seem,
continue to feel limited by the restrictions imposed by the Linux
distribution model. 
<p>
Iproute2 is a collection of network-configuration tools found on almost any
Linux system; it includes utilities like <tt>arpd</tt>, <tt>ip</tt> (the
command old-timers guiltily think they should be using when they type
<tt>ifconfig</tt>), <tt>ss</tt>, and <tt>tc</tt>.  That last command, in
particular, is used to configure the traffic-control subsystem, which
allows administrators to manage and prioritize the flow of network traffic
through their systems.  This subsystem has, for some years, had the
capability to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-bpf.8.html">load and run BPF
programs</a> to both classify packets and make decisions on how to queue
them.  This mechanism gives administrators a great deal of flexibility in
the management of network traffic.
<p>
The code for handling BPF programs within iproute2 is old, though, and
lacks support for many of the features that have been added to BPF in the
last few years.  Since that code was written, the BPF community has
developed libbpf (which lives <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/tools/lib/bpf">in the
kernel source tree</a>)  as the preferred way to work with BPF programs and load
them into the kernel.  This is not a small task; libbpf must interpret the
instructions encoded as special ELF sections in an executable BPF program
and make the necessary calls to the sprawling <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
system call.  This work can include creating maps, "relocating" structure
offsets to match the configuration of the running kernel, loading programs,
and attaching those programs to the appropriate hooks within the kernel.
Libbpf has grown quickly, along with the rest of the BPF ecosystem.
<p>
The obvious way to add support for current BPF features to iproute2 is to
dump the old code used there in favor of libbpf; patches to that effect
have been posted by Hangbin Liu, <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201023033855.3894509-1-haliu@redhat.com/">starting in late
October</a>.  Shortly thereafter, David Ahern, one of the iproute2
maintainers, <a
href="/ml/bpf/7babcccb-2b31-f9bf-16ea-6312e449b928@gmail.com/">pointed
out</a> that the posted patches fail to compile on an Ubuntu 20.10 system;
Liu <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201029020637.GM2408@dhcp-12-153.nay.redhat.com/">responded</a>
that Ahern needed to update to a newer version of libbpf, and libbpf
developer Andrii Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzZR4MqQJCD4kzFsbhpfmp4RB7SHcP5AbAiqzqK7to2u+g@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
including libbpf as a submodule of iproute2.  That is where
the trouble began; Ahern <a
href="/ml/bpf/b17e7428-dd99-09f8-7254-c61d25a0c797@gmail.com/">asserted</a>
that libbpf is provided by distributions and that iproute2 needs to
work with the version that is available.  Nakryiko
<a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzacgsZiXQJPM=j_cKW=3pF8Kwx=JvY9FjMgvJ1HzfyVAA@mail.gmail.com/">argued</a>
instead that libbpf is "<q>a fast moving target right now</q>" and that
packaging it with iproute2 is "<q>pragmatic</q>".  Needless to say,
this feeling did not find universal agreement.

<p>
The arguments against "vendoring" libraries like libbpf in this way have been made many
times, and they appeared here as well.  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201029123801.4d03ebb5@carbon/">repeated</a> the usual security
argument: copies of libraries buried within other packages are difficult to
find and update if a problem is found.  Jiri Benc <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201103094224.6de1470d@redhat.com/">added</a> that the end
result of this process would be a massive bundling of dependencies, which
"<q>would be nightmare for both distros and users</q>".  Distributors
have long been opposed to bundling dependencies in this way, and the
iproute2 developers do not see any reason to go against this policy for
libbpf.
<p>
The BPF developers see things differently and were not shy about expressing
their feelings.  Alexei Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAADnVQ+EWmmjec08Y6JZGnan=H8=X60LVtwjtvjO5C6M-jcfpg@mail.gmail.com/">asserted</a>
that Ahern is "<q>deaf to technical arguments</q>" and raised the
idea of forking iproute2 in response.  He later <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201103225554.pjyuuhdklj5idk3u@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">said</a>
that using the distribution-provided libbpf would be worse than not using
libbpf at all, and that if he could remove the existing BPF support from
iproute2, he would do so.  Things reached a point where Toke
Høiland-Jørgensen <a href="/ml/bpf/874klwcg1p.fsf@toke.dk/">asked</a> him
to "<q>stop with this 'my way or the highway' extortion</q>" so that
the discussion could make some progress.
<p>
The argument for bundling libbpf with iproute2 seems to come down to a
distrust in the version of libbpf that distributors will ship.  There are two aspects
to this, one being that iproute2 could end up linking to a version of
libbpf that introduces bugs; as <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201104031145.nmtggnzomfee4fma@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">Starovoitov
put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	When we release new version of libbpf it goes through rigorous
	testing.  bpftool gets a lot of test coverage as well.  iproute2
	with shared libbpf will get nothing. It's the same random roll of
	dice.  New libbpf may or may not break iproute2. That's awful user
	experience.
</div>
<p>
Benc <a href="/ml/bpf/20201104110157.52f661eb@redhat.com/">disagreed</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	"Random roll of dice" would be true only if libbpf did incredibly
	bad job in keeping backward compatibility. In my experience it is
	not the case.
</div>
<p>
In a separate branch of the discussion, Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201104024559.gxullc7e6boaupuk@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">extolled</a>
the compatibility of libbpf releases, saying that "<q>users can upgrade
and downgrade libbpf version at any time</q>".  Others agreed that
libbpf releases are managed well and do not create compatibility problems.  
So it is not really clear what the concern is here.
<p>

The related issue, though, is the worry that using the distribution-provided
libbpf will lead to inconsistency across systems and an inability for users
to know which features will be supported just by looking at the version of
iproute2 they are running.  Beyond that, the BPF developers fear that
distributors will stick 
with an old libbpf, depriving users of newer features even if they have a
current version of iproute2.  Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzbQz5ZqoB3TEtM-4e=Ndx9WCGN16Be8-JoK+mvUyAGC3w@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that users do want the newer features supported by libbpf, but BPF
maintainer Daniel Borkman repeatedly <a
href="/ml/bpf/321a2728-7a43-4a48-fe97-dab45b76e6fb@iogearbox.net/">claimed</a>
that distributors cannot be trusted to keep up with libbpf releases.  That,
it is argued, will lead to a poor experience for iproute2 users.  Tying a
specific version of libbpf to each iproute2 release, instead, would make
life more predictable.
<p>
Ahern <a
href="/ml/bpf/ec50328d-61ab-71fb-f266-5e49e9dbf98e@gmail.com/">didn't
entirely buy that line of reasoning</a>, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	User experience keeps getting brought up, but I also keep reading
	the stance that BPF users can not expect a consistent experience
	unless they are constantly chasing latest greatest versions of
	*ALL* S/W related to BPF. That is not a realistic expectation for
	users. Distributions exist for a reason. They solve real packaging
	problems.
</div>
<p>
That brought out a few other developers who complained about the need to
keep multiple components all at the latest versions for things to work
properly.  Edward Cree, for example, <a
href="/ml/bpf/11c18a26-72af-2e0d-a411-3148cfbc91be@solarflare.com/">complained</a>
about the lack of attention to interoperability in general:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The bpf developers seem to have taken the position that since
	they're in control of clang, libbpf and the kernel, they can make
	their changes across all three and not bother with the specs that
	would allow other toolchains to interoperate.
</div>
<p>
Starovoitov actually <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201111180827.cbyljiknmzf5agf2@ast-mbp/">agreed</a> that the
situation needs to improve — someday.  "<q>BPF ecosystem eventually
will get to a point of fixed file format, linker specification and 1000
page psABI document.</q>"  For now, though, things are evolving too
quickly for that, he added.
<p>
Toward the end, Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzaSfutBt3McEPjmu_FyxyzJa_xVGfhP_7v0oGuqG_HBEw@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that, if distributors make a point of updating libbpf and setting
the dependencies for iproute2 to require the updated versions, things might
work well enough.  Benc <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201106094425.5cc49609@redhat.com/">replied</a> that Red
Hat, at least, works that way now, leading Nakryiko to <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4Bzb2fuZ+Mxq21HEUKcOEba=rYZHc+1FTQD98=MPxwj8R3g@mail.gmail.com/">reply</a>
that this "<q>would be sufficient in practice</q>".  Starovoitov
still <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAADnVQ+S7fusZ6RgXBKJL7aCtt3jpNmCnCkcXd0fLayu+Rw_6Q@mail.gmail.com/">pushed</a>
for iproute2 to require a minimum libbpf version that increases with each release so that
there would be at least some correlation between the iproute2 and libbpf
versions.  Stephen Hemminger, who also maintains iproute2, <a
href="/ml/bpf/20201106152537.53737086@hermes.local/">seems unwilling</a> to
impose that sort of requirement, though.
<p>
In the end, it appears that iproute2 will be packaged like almost all other
Linux utilities; it will use the version of libbpf shipped by the
distribution it is running on rather than supplying its own.  The
distributors will just have to be sure that they keep libbpf current with
other kernel-derived utilities; this is something they have long since
learned to do.
<p>
The tensions around the quickly evolving BPF subsystem seem
unlikely to go away, though; one group of users is already relying on
BPF-based tools while the developers continue to evolve the whole ecosystem
in a hurry.  Ahern <a
href="/ml/bpf/8bd665e1-f82b-1543-9791-8b41da855327@gmail.com/">described</a>
the situation this way: "<q>The trend that related s/w is outdated 2-3
months after a release can be taken as a sign that bpf is not stable and
ready for distributions to take on and support</q>".
But that, too, should be a tractable problem;
Linux as a whole has been supporting users while undergoing constant
modification for nearly 30&nbsp;years, after all.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Feel free to file an issue or ask for help in the IRC. We can’t promise we can fix it but we can try to help. <br>
<p>
But to your point, yeah, you’re absolutely right. bpftrace is at the intersection of all these fast moving pieces of software and we dynamically link (by default) all our dependencies. We do our best to feature detect what’s available on the system but sometimes stuff slips through. Vendoring is very tempting at times...<br>

Ubuntu provides many HWE package stacks on LTS releases and updates them on 6 month cycle bringing new NVIDIA, Xorg, llvm toolchains, rust, kernels, and lots of other things.<br>

There is no reason why libbpf cannot be part of that train as an -hwe variant if that&#x27;s what is state of the art and needed to function well on top of the latest backport kernel.<br>

I wouldn&#x27;t cast such a wide net as &quot;Fast-moving projects [...] continue to feel limited by the restrictions imposed by the Linux distribution model.&quot; as this seems to be a Debian world problem to me. In openSUSE we already do this for most (all?) golang packages and use the &quot;bundled&quot; mechanism[0] to track security and other issues.<br>
<p>
Of course, we try to avoid this to lower the security overhead, but if there is a good reason for this (as in the libbpf case), there is no reason to patch upstream and introduce possible problems.<br>

Except it isn&#x27;t though, this whole rigamarole was about &quot;outdated&quot; packages, but Debian has the very latest iproute2 always uploaded at most a couple of days later after the release to unstable, and a week or two later to stable-backports. I know because I do it.<br>
Obviously an LTS does not update packages wholesale - that&#x27;s the entire point of an LTS distribution. Customers and users of an LTS distro by and large do _not_ want constant churn. Stable means stable. There are rolling distros or fast-release-cycle distros for those who want that - if you want latest and greatest every day of every week, they are there for that exact purpose.<br>
Still, Debian has backports to _optionally_ get new stuff if one wants to, and Ubuntu has hwe.<br>
<p>
Debian and Ubuntu also statically link golang stuff and use a similar mechanism to track sources (Built-Using) as SUSE does.<br>
<p>
That whole thread seems to be a much-ado-about-nothing, lots of ideology and lots of contempt for distros, and little else. Not exactly good publicity for the BPF ecosystem, I must say.<br>

I&#x27;ve the same issue with dwarves, I&#x27;d be much happier to explicitly depend on a regular Debian package instead of a git repo. It&#x27;s a matter of traceability, reproducibility and, obviously, trust. Debian (and many other distributions) manage this with packages and versions, community and support.<br>

<p>
If there was something I could erase from the Linux distribution landscape, it is the equivalency of "LTS" to "stale". There are a number of models where long-term supported distribution releases do not freeze the stack for the entire life of the release. Neither Red Hat Enterprise Linux nor SUSE Linux Enterprise do this, and clearly their customers aren't throwing pitchforks at them. If anything, they are asking for <em>more</em> updates and rebases! So clearly that's not it.

<p>
You&#x27;re right.  The difference is the word &quot;Enterprise&quot;.  The customers aren&#x27;t throwing pitchforks because they&#x27;re throwing cash.  Cash that can be used to keep a long-term distribution stable AND keep it up to date.<br>

Debian doesn&#x27;t get any cash, and yet there are daily updates to stable via -security and quarterly-ish via -updates. Of course they are targeted, contained and backward compatible updates - which is what users of an LTS distro want.<br>

<p>
I think a lot of users of an LTS distro want is just something without bugs.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend finding and fixing bugs, the only way to get something without bugs is to keep it stable.  Change it only to to fix bugs, and it will get less and less buggy as time goes on.
<p>
But if those users could have it all - modern function and no bugs - they would.

<p>
If the user runs some important application not included within the distro a serious bug with this application could be introduced by a change in the distro. So LTS isn&#x27;t only about a bug free distro but about bug free application+distro. From a user perspective any bug of my important application caused by a change in a LTS distro is a bug of the distro.<br>

If there&#x27;s a really shining example of people (many of them committed supporters of certain init systems) being &quot;resistant to change&quot;, it would be that - 22 years after becoming obsolete because of new features introduced in Linux 2.2  and unmaintained for 15 years - people still almost universally refuse to let go of ifconfig &amp; friends. :-&gt;&gt;<br>

Thing is, for some of us, ifconfig has always worked, and has always been there.<br>
<p>
Why can&#x27;t it just be updated to take advantage of the new features, rather than ditching it and starting afresh?<br>
<p>
I don&#x27;t care much about which tools I use, I just wish the UI wouldn&#x27;t change or disappear. I now need to learn a complete new command and options, just to do something simple like find out my computer&#x27;s IP address!<br>

(a) I&#x27;m sure you could send patches<br>

(b) the primary &#x27;benefit&#x27; of ifconfig is familiar syntax (to old timers)... but that syntax (both in terms of cli flags, and in terms of text output) is exactly what has to evolve/change to support the new features... so you wouldn&#x27;t actually end up with something all that familiar anyway...<br>

ifconfig has better ergonomics than ip though. &quot;ifconfig&quot; by itself prints out a ton of useful information in a nice compact format. &quot;ip&quot; gives me an error message with a bunch of config options I don&#x27;t care about, like &quot;ntable&quot; and &quot;maximum-addr-flush-attempts&quot;.

It may seem silly or trivial, but making the default output of &quot;ip&quot; look like &quot;ip addr&quot; would help get people off &quot;ifconfig&quot;.<br>

Sadly, that wouldn&#x27;t help. Even if &quot;ip&quot; without arguments did show something like &quot;ip -s addr show&quot; (or &quot;ip -s a&quot;) does - i.e. everything &quot;ifconfig&quot; does and more, the ifconfig fanclub would still complain. They don&#x27;t care that ifconfig shows you things that don&#x27;t exist, they don&#x27;t care that it does not show important information, they don&#x27;t care that it sometimes does something completely different than you would expect, they don&#x27;t care that it uses different syntax for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, they didn&#x27;t care that it used to truncate interface names to 9 characters. It&#x27;s their pet and they won&#x27;t accept anything else on principle, even if it has more consistent syntax, actually works and is way more powerful.<br>
<p>
The real problem is that even today, new articles and books are being written which teach people to use ifconfig (route, arp, netstat, ...). Thus even people who only learned about ifconfig when it had been already obsolete for 15 years, keep saying &quot;I&#x27;m used to it, I don&#x27;t want to learn something new.&quot;<br>

If there are indeed so many people who have been using it and prefer to continue using it, then the logical conclusion is that it is not &quot;obsolete&quot;.<br>

I think you meant to say _incomplete_ -- because ifconfig is very much _compatible_ with modern kernels; it just can&#x27;t configure every possible option.  Indeed, even today ifconfig does everything that most users need.<br>

No, I did not mean &quot;incomplete&quot; because the lack of features is only one part of the problem - and perhaps a minor one. For example, ifconfig (and the ioctl interface it uses) still pretends a network interface has (at most) one IPv4 address which is _set_ while kernel maintains a set of addresses which can be added to or removed from. To work around this, It also pretends there are &quot;alias interfaces&quot; which no longer exist since kernel 2.2, leading to its own kind of problems like &quot;ifconfig foo:0 mtu 1400&quot; actually changing MTU of foo. There are real people who made a remote host unresponsive because of this caveat and real poeple who keep asking why they cannot use &quot;eth0:0&quot; as an interface name in netfilter rules.<br>

      It's also worth looking at the status output of both commands in detail and see why people might prefer "ifconfig" to "ip". In particular: compare this "ip" output:

<pre>

    403122417  957242   0       0       0       0       
</pre>

to this "ifconfig" output:

<pre>

        inet 192.168.86.185  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.86.255

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</pre>

<p>Both outputs are a bit noisy, but the "ifconfig" one is less so and prettier. Why does "ip" output a numeric prefix before each interface ("2:" above) instead of just the interface name? Why do the statistics for "ip" have to be in the form of a table ("RX:", "TX:") instead of a simpler "ifconfig"-style one-statistic-per-line approach? The "valid_lft 3075sec preferred_lft 1275sec" bit is pure noise for most people.

<p>And why can't "ip" wrap lines at some reasonable length?

<p>"ifconfig" persists when "ip" exists not <i>only</i> because people are irrationally stubborn, but also because "ifconfig" output produces output that makes the eyes bleed less than "ip"'s output. The brain is an association machine. If typing "ip" is followed by displeasure, for whatever reason and typing "ifconfig" is not followed by similar displeasure, then people are going to type "ifconfig" regardless of the theoretical advantages of typing "ip". 

<p>A few minor human-centered tweaks to "ip"'s interface would go a long way towards making people prefer it to "ifconfig".

Just something to think about: us humans are rather diverse. There are very few things about that the output of either that could be said to be objectively better. It&#x27;s all a matter of preference. And your personal preferences aren&#x27;t everyone else&#x27;s.<br>
<p>
Therefore I think that this…<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; A few minor human-centered tweaks to &quot;ip&quot;&#x27;s interface would go a long way towards making people prefer it to &quot;ifconfig&quot;.</font><br>
<p>
…is a fool&#x27;s errand. For example:<br>
<p>
To _me_ the tabular layout of ip&#x27;s counters is much easier to grasp at a glance. To _me_ seeing the queueing discipline is important. To _me_ having long lines is actually a boon as I&#x27;m running terminals that are much wider than 80 characters (as monitors have been way wider than tall for decades now I find wrapping at 80 absolutely unreasonable). That all addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) are written in prefix notation and that I don&#x27;t have to convert between netmask &amp; prefix length is a huge boon for me. Dealing with IPv6 a lot I absolutely need to see the relevant flags (e.g. &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;mngtmpaddr&quot;).<br>
<p>
Last but certainly not least: whenever I need to parse that information I simply let ip output JSON. That alone is a total killer argument for _me_.<br>
<p>
My point is not that ip is better than ifconfig, just that there is no &quot;standard human&quot;, and therefore saying thinks like &quot;human-centered&quot; is so imprecise that it&#x27;s worthless.<br>

<p>
I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone with a _single_ terminal spanning their entire monitor width, at least not in landscape mode. The monitor width has very little to do with line length, I don&#x27;t understand how this myth persists.<br>
<p>
The 80 characters limit is just  a pure convention now: you can&#x27;t have everyone choosing any random limit and expect text to look good on others&#x27; terminal without any waste of screen estate either.<br>
<p>
Depending on the programming language and code style (not monitor width), I agree 80 tends to be a bit short but it&#x27;s very hard to change conventions. 100 characters seems like a decent trade-off but during the never ending &quot;transition&quot; there will be frequent wrapping and 20% waste.<br>

Oh, once in a while I do use a single terminal spanning my entire monitor width.  In fact I have used a single terminal spanning two side-by-side 2560x1440 monitors, using a substantially smaller font, to fit a large table in vim ;-)  But those are exceptions.<br>
<p>
Still, my (multiple) coding windows have 80 columns.  When needed, they can be widened temporarily with a keyboard shortcut.<br>
<p>
A wider terminal window can be useful for build or serial console output.  But coding: 80 columns.<br>

Ignoring the actual historical contingency reasons for all this (Hollerith cards, etc)... one reason why having a limited length of line may be useful is a truly ancient typographical rule rooted in the biology of vision: in 10-point text at a typical reading distance, any text longer than 65--70 chars or so *under certain other constraints* is too long for easy reading: the eye will tend to lose its visual lock on the line and wander off onto neighbouring lines. It&#x27;s obvious when this happens to you because it is *incredibly annoying* and you&#x27;ll get frustrated after only a few lines like this in succession.<br>
<p>
But, of course, there are constraints, which make this rule mostly irrelevant for source code. It came from book typesetting and before that quite possibly even handwritten manuscript production, where what is usually produced is text consisting of densely-set paragraphs, more or less rectangles of text with one shorter line at the end, perhaps with a slightly-ragged right edge, but not very ragged because that looks ugly. Source code looks nothing like this: the right edge is extremely ragged, and any lines that stretch the full width are probably standing on their own, not surrounded by text out on the right edge. Lines standing on their own like this are more or less immune from the eye losing track of which line the eye is on: the long line quite literally stands out from the lines around it.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, source code is usually indented, and even if it was set as dense paragraphs, the typographical rule runs from the *left edge of the indentation*, not from the left edge of the file (though in books, whole-para indentations are often applied at both edges, expanding both margins, because indented regions are usually quite rare and you want them to stand out). It&#x27;s perfectly all right, from the perspective of the eye losing track of a line, if the para the line is part of starts 120 chars from the left edge, as long as the *line itself* doesn&#x27;t have too much text in it.<br>

Did it ever occur to you that the actual reason why you see ifconfig output as prettier, easier to read, &quot;human centered&quot; or even &quot;making eyes bleed less&quot; is that you are used to it? For me, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite: whenever I have to deal with ifconfig or route output, it&#x27;s much harder for me to parse it - and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m lucky that the information I&#x27;m looking for is actually there. What you call &quot;pure noise&quot; may be an important piece of information for someone else (and so is what you call &quot;numeric prefix&quot;). BtW, most people don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t run either of these commands so it&#x27;s rather irrelevant what is &quot;pure noise for most people&quot;.<br>
<p>
Ad &quot;simpler &quot;ifconfig&quot;-style one-statistic-per-line approach&quot;: are you really talking about the same output as you presented? What I see is one line with two stats, one with four, then again one with two and one with four. I&#x27;m not sure what you call &quot;one-statistic-per-line&quot; style there.<br>

<p>
It did occur to me, but I still think the ifconfig output is better. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a universal truth, but being familiar with both commands, my preference is still ifconfig&#x27;s output. In general, while familiarity does affect our perception of UI quality, it is and must be possible to compare one UI against another and say one is better.<br>
<p>
Besides: if the output style really doesn&#x27;t make a difference, why *not* stick with the ifconfig style for familiarity&#x27;s sake? The goal is to get everyone off obsolete tools, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<p>
Sometimes, when people replace tool X with tool Y on the grounds that X is obsolete, they make Y differ from X in ways arbitrary ways that aren&#x27;t related to X&#x27;s obsolescence, causing needless pain in the transition. I say that when we replace X with Y, we make Y resemble X as much as possible to drive adoption of Y and reduce transition pain. For example, I think Python 3 should have kept its print statement: making print a function was a needless incompatibility.<br>

I wholeheartedly disagree. As long as neither is doing something immensely stupid such as presenting numbers in binary or octal, how information is perceived and digested highly depends on the human doing the digesting. We&#x27;re so diverse in how we work that there cannot be one canonical best way do present it.<br>
<p>
As said elsewhere, I highly prefer ip&#x27;s output. You don&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s fine, but please don&#x27;t think that just because you prefer ifconfig&#x27;s output, that that&#x27;s a universal truth or proof of it being better than ip&#x27;s.<br>

Mostly because it&#x27;s wildly irregular and more or less impossible to extend. The ip output format is, uh, a bit painful to read (I suspect due to the lack of anything resembling punctuation), but it&#x27;s extremely extensible and it does have one valuable extra property: each line-and-following-indented-lines group is in many cases valid or almost valid *input* to the corresponding ip subcommand, or at least similar enough that you can tell what to feed ip to replicate this configuration again (or to change it slightly). ifconfig has nothing like this.<br>

Well, ifconfig has &quot;always worked and always been there&quot; for me since RedHat 3.0.3. But Linux 2.2 (released in 1998) added a bunch of useful features to the networking stack, eg, binding more than one protocol address to an interface, and because the guy who added them had a Cisco- and not a BSD-background (AFAIK), he also wrote a new, extensible command-line tool with a more orthogonal interface closer to the Cisco interface (eg, everything can be uniquely abbreviated).<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m still using the exact fvwm2 configuration I did already use in 1998 and with how many &quot;turn everything upside down and paint everything which used to be green in pink with orange flowers on it !&quot; cycles has everyone else put up with since 1998?  But using &quot;ip addr&quot; instead of &quot;ifconfig&quot; is just too much of a botheration?<br>

<p>
I just used to type &quot;ifconfig&quot; - no bothering with arguments and it told me all the basic stuff I needed to know. I don&#x27;t think &quot;ip&quot; does that - you need the argument? Which means I need to remember more than just the basic command, and I don&#x27;t use it much so I&#x27;m faffing around with man pages all the time ...<br>
<p>
To my mind the obvious solution would have been to keep the single binary, but make the functionality dependent on the name it&#x27;s called by. New functionality would require calling by the new name.<br>
<p>
Still, hindsight is always 20/20 :-)<br>

      <tt>ip l</tt> + <tt>ip a</tt> provide equivalent information to no-options <tt>ifconfig</tt>. How Linux handles multiple IP addresses/masks per network interface (exposed directly by iproute2) just doesn't match the <tt>ifconfig</tt> command-line interface, though.

&#x27;ip addr&#x27; displays all the information &#x27;ip link&#x27; does about links and then adds address info to that, so that is usually enough unless you&#x27;re looking for. ip -s addr if you want packet stats too (which I almost never do, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s off by default).

And `ip` doesn&#x27;t understand `-h` at *all*, which is a cardinal sin for a Unix utility.  (Though what can one expect from a Cisco-ism.)<br>

I think it&#x27;s supposed to indicate that the -s option applies to many ip subcommands. Quite a lot of other commands these days do the same thing: git for one. I find it a bit annoying, too, but it does allow git -P diff and git diff -P to mean different things... which matters a lot for a metastasized mega-command like git and... not so much at all for ip.<br>

<p>
Only if the basic stuff you need to know includes nothing at all about the routing table. It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine what networking problem that might be :) and the route output is, uh, completely different (and even more wildly inaccurate than ifconfig&#x27;s, to such an extent that it&#x27;s often impossible to use it to tell what&#x27;s going where).<br>
<p>
Meanwhile in the ip world we have &#x27;ip route get&#x27;, which can tell you which route will be used for a packet to a given address. This is immensely valuable with complex multi-table routing setups and would on its own justify the existence of ip, in my eyes (though of course you can&#x27;t set up such things at all with the ifconfig/route tools).<br>

Why not check the version of the system library and choose between a submodule and the system libbpf? That&#x27;s what QEMU does for a handful of smaller, less common libraries and it works great across both older and bleeding edge distros.<br>

      Because what QEMU does is <em>insane</em>! It's the worst of all worlds, because now there's an unpredictable failure mode with it switching to something that may not necessarily be adapted to the environment it's being built for. One of the reasons I <em>hate</em> shipping QEMU is that this brittle setup messes with my ability to build QEMU properly.

Agreed (though I&#x27;ve no first-hand experience with QEMU itself). What I&#x27;ve done for embedding is default to the internal version, but the flag to use the external version means that it required to be externally provided. This wishy-washy &quot;what is it doing?&quot; kind of questions about build systems are not fun to answer months down the line when you need to debug it.<br>

I am not sure I understand. The bundled one is used as a known-good fallback, if you hate it so much you can force usage of distro libraries with configure command-line options. Most QEMU developers use the distro libraries, and so do most CI environments (not CentOS 7 of course :)) so it should not be a problem to do so. <br>
<p>
In any case, have you reported a bug whenever you got this unpredictable failure mode?<br>

I find it bizarre that the BPF folks are claiming to be so concerned with end users of libbpf when their documentation is so horrible.<br>

In late 2019, I spent well over a full week doing research on how to load an ebpf program into the network stack. It&#x27;s like climbing a brick wall.<br>

This all seems overwhelmingly easier to deal with than the Kubernetes vendoring problem. Ultimately, it means iproute2 needs to do what everybody has been doing all along: if the system libbpf lacks a feature, users don&#x27;t get stuff that depends on that feature. And, new kernels come with a matching libbpf, because why wouldn&#x27;t they?<br>
<p>
The Kubernetes problem can be solved by treating all Golang programs as if they were scripts, and compiling them, with all their dependencies, at package installation time. (This is akin to what we already do when installing Elisp and Python modules, or kernel modules.) Then, a Golang library package just maintains a local repository shared among all the installed versions. The dependency annotations for each program package identify everything needed, so that installing a Golang program package would amount to fetching the all the right revisions to local repositories, checking them out, building, and then discarding the checkouts.<br>
<p>
In fact the C compiler is also fast enough that libbfd and other fast-moving dependencies could be treated much the same way.<br>

It seems to me that the underlying problem is that the person who decided to refactor iproute2 to use libbpf started with the latest version of libbpf.  At that point, the problem was baked in, and waiting to hatch.<br>
<p>
If you&#x27;re going to try to do this kind of thing, and thus add a dependency, start with the oldest version of the library used by any still-supported version of a major distro.  If you want to use newer features, that&#x27;s fine, you can do feature-detection at compile time and use newer stuff if (and only if) it&#x27;s there (as danobi mentions the bpftrace people do, in a comment above).  Distros that happen to be on newer versions can thus take advantage of that, without introducing show-stoppers for distros that don&#x27;t.<br>
<p>
If instead you start off your refactoring by requiring a library version that&#x27;s not even in the very latest version of a major distro, you&#x27;re heading for trouble.  When you hit it, saying it&#x27;s the distro user&#x27;s fault, and that they need to upgrade the library, isn&#x27;t going to impress the user community, or speed up acceptance of your work.<br>

I do not know the specific, but I have done similar tasks. <br>
At some point you hit bugs or missing feature in the library you intent to use, so you send patches for those and depend on the first version of the library that have the fix or needed feature, even though it was not what was planned.<br>

I&#x27;m a bit confused as to what the perceived problem is here. The distro comes with libbpf _and_ iproute2.<br>
<p>
Normal users won&#x27;t ever replace either one, so they don&#x27;t need new iproute2 to have compatibility with old libbpf.<br>
<p>
Distro maintainers working on a new version can trivially upgrade libbpf while upgrading iproute2, so they surely don&#x27;t need it.<br>
<p>
Developers of iproute2 can install a local copy of the latest libbpf to do their development work, if need be. It takes maybe an extra 5 minutes, really not a big deal...<br>
<p>
Who _actually_ needs to be able to install a new iproute2 (replacing the distro version!) but cannot build a new version of libbpf2, first, when the distro version is too old?<br>

This.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve done just the same kind of thing with man-db and libpipeline: for a while there were several occasions when man-db needed a new feature in libpipeline, so I released a new version of libpipeline and bumped its required minimum version in man-db.  Distros upgraded both and got on with their lives.  Nobody has ever complained.<br>
<p>
In the Kubernetes case I at least have some sympathy for people with genuinely incompatible needs trying to solve a hard problem.  In this case it sounds more like people looking for an excuse to complain about distribution models, and not really coming up with a terribly convincing one.<br>

From the bpf side, the argument seems to boil down to the assumption that distro&#x27;s would keep updating iproute2 with every kernel release, but would not update libbpf the same way. I don&#x27;t understand why this would happen though.<br>

I think this is exactly the problem and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s an observation rather than an assumption. As for why, my guess is that while iproute2 is considered to be one of core packages so that there is a pressure to keep it up-to-date, this may not always be the case for libbpf, unless there is a sufficiently enthusiastic maintainer.<br>

If the next iproute2 requires a new-enough libbpf version in order to build, this problem quite simply solves itself -- the priority of updating iproute2 will transfer to libbpf, and the package will get updated.<br>

This IMHO the best solution. It is already mentioned in the paragraph starting &quot;Toward the end...&quot;, I just don&#x27;t understand its last sentence as the e-mail linked by &quot;seems unwilling&quot; doesn&#x27;t really seem to disagree with this approach. AFAICS Stephen just wanted to make sure the requirement for new iproute2 to work with old kernel (even if with features limited to what that kernel supports) is going to be preserved.<br>

What&#x27;s grimly amusing to me is that this debate was settled 30 years ago in the Windows world. Nothing has changed. Here, I see the same perspectives advancing the same arguments, all of which are flawed for sadly familiar reasons. This whole discussion is indicative of why we can&#x27;t make progress as an industry.<br>

      <p>If you think Windows is immune… Sorry, but no.

<p>I can assert you as someone who spent few <b>hours</b> recently trying to convince Visual Studio Express to install on a certain Windows 8 system. I have <b>no</b> idea what happened to .NET install there, but all attempts to solve that issue and attempts to use tools provided by Microsoft and others to solve that issue… failed. The mere fact that there are numerous tools shows that debate is far from being “settled”.

<p>The only thing that Windows have done right is just a simple reduction of scope: most programs bring most dependencies with them which means chance to get crazy breakage is reduced. But when you need something which is part of an OS… you get the same dismal experience on Windows, too.

<p>P.S. Since my friend only needed <b>some</b> C++ IDE for the University courses in the end problem was solved by using MinGW and CLion. Neither needs .NET at all thus everything worked beautifully.

Also, that &quot;solution&quot; means windows with 10 applications takes 200GB of disk, while ubuntu with a thousand applications takes 20GB. They say storage is cheap and thus ok to waste, but observe every single instance of a new storage technology getting invented (SSDs most commonly).<br>
<p>
Not to mention every library is loaded 50 times because it&#x27;s duplicated in every application.<br>

You can see this effect when trying to make useful CI Docker images for Windows builds. I believe that Windows Docker containers are limited to around 20G by default (almost certainly by Docker Hub). I don&#x27;t know how changeable this is (e.g., it might be baked in at (base) image creation time). Fun things with Windows container usages:<br>
<p>
  - Base images are usually 4GB+ (the Linux image with &quot;all possible external dependencies&quot; is 2.6GB)<br>
  - Visual Studio requires a specific base image that is 6GB+ which contains a .NET Runtime install which apparently can&#x27;t be done in any other image (so much for composability)<br>
  - Installing one Visual Studio version and toolchain is another 3GB+<br>
  - Dependencies (e.g., Qt) can be another GB or more<br>
<p>
This leaves you with very limited space for doing what you&#x27;d want inside of a container (such as a CI build). We&#x27;re still using bare metal for Windows builds despite the existence of Docker on Windows.<br>

This problem hasn&#x27;t been &quot;solved&quot; for 30 years because there is no silver bullet; no simple, one-size-fits-all solution. <br>
<p>
This isn&#x27;t to say nothing has changed, we most notably have the Internet now. Now even when ignoring the 8 fallacies of distributed computing, no one would go for the extreme of the entire Internet downloading and using the same library every time! Oh, wait... <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/681410/">https://lwn.net/Articles/681410/</a> :-D<br>
<p>
No simple solution for building, versioning, distributing and configuring software, only a large panel of engineering trade-offs for various situations. The reason these arguments keep coming is because many developers underestimate these problems and are even sometimes condescending with the people who are trying to solve them. Imagine hearing that soon enough computers will be capable  to write better code than the one you&#x27;re writing right now because you&#x27;re not really solving difficult problems, &quot;just do this, it&#x27;s not hard&quot;. It is hard actually. The very first step is to acknowledge it is and respect (not: agree with) different approaches.<br>

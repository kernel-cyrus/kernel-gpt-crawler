Progress in the virtualization world sometimes seems slow.  Xen has been
the hot topic in the paravirtualization area for some years now - the first
"stable" release was <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/52033/">announced</a>
in 2003 - but the code remains outside of the mainline Linux kernel.  News
from that project has been relatively scarce as of late - though the Xen
hackers are certainly still out there working on the code.
<p>

On the other hand, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/216794/">KVM</a>
appears to be to be on the fast path.  This project first surfaced in
October, 2006; it found its way into the 2.6.20 kernel a few months later.
On February&nbsp;25, KVM&nbsp;15 was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/223754/">announced</a>; this release has an
interesting new feature: live migration.  The speed with which the KVM
developers have been able to add relatively advanced features is
impressive; equally impressive is just how simple the code which implements
live migration is.
<p>

KVM starts with a big advantage over other virtualization projects: it
relies on support from the hardware, which is only available in recent
processors.  As a result, KVM will not work on the bulk of
currently-deployed systems.  On the other hand, designing for future
hardware is often a good idea - the future tends to come quickly in the
technology world.  By focusing on hardware-supported virtualization, KVM
is able to concentrate on developing interesting features to run on the systems
that companies are buying now.
<p>

The migration code is built into the QEMU emulator; the relevant source
file is less than 800 lines long.  The live migration task comes down to
the following steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A connection is made to the destination system.  This can currently be 
     done with a straight TCP connection to an open port on the destination
     (which would not be the most secure way to go) or by way of ssh.
<p>
<li> The guest's memory is copied to the destination.  This process is just 
     a matter of looping through the guest's physical address space (which
     is just virtual memory on the host side) and sending it, one page at a
     time, to the destination system.  As each page is copied, it is made
     read-only for the guest.
<p>
<li> The guest is still running while this copy process is happening.
     Whenever it tries to modify a page which has already been copied, it
     will trap back into QEMU, which restores write access and marks the
     page dirty.  Copying memory thus becomes an iterative process; once
     the entire range has been done, the migration code loops back to the
     beginning and re-copies all pages which have been modified by the
     guest.  The hope is that the list of pages which must be copied
     shrinks with each pass over the space.
<p>
<li> Once the number of dirty pages goes below a threshold, the guest
     system is stopped and the remaining pages are copied.  Then it's just
     a matter of transmitting the current state of the guest (registers, in
     particular) and the job is done; the migrated guest can be restarted
     on its new host system.
</ul>
<p>
As it happens, guest systems can be moved between Intel and AMD processors
with no problems at all.  Moving a 64-bit guest to a 32-bit host remains
impossible; the KVM developers appear uninterested in fixing this
particular limitation anytime soon.  A little more information can be found
on <a href="http://kvm.qumranet.com/kvmwiki/Migration">the KVM migration
page</a>.
<p>

The other feature of note is the announced plan to freeze the KVM interface
for 2.6.21.  This interface has been evolving quickly, despite the fact
that it is a user-space API; this flexibility has been allowed because KVM
is new, experimental, and has no real user base yet.  The freezing of the
API suggests that the KVM developers think things are reaching a stable
point where KVM can be put to work in production systems.  Perhaps that
means that, soon, we'll find out how <a
href="http://qumranet.com/">Qumranet</a>, the company which has been
funding the KVM work, plans to make its living.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
KVM migration is being developed in parallel to QEMU migration.  It will actually be possible to migration a 64-bit KVM guest to a 32-bit host running qemu-system-x86_64.  In fact, it will be possible to migrate a 64-bit x86 KVM guest to qemu-system-x86_64 running on PowerPC (or any platform that QEMU supports).<br>
<p>
Of course, you are moving from a virtualized host to an emulated host so performance will suffer.  Even if a host is 64-bit capable, if it's running in 32-bit mode, supporting a 64-bit guest is just too much of a pain for virtualization.<br>

No, assuming the guest is running under kvm (and not pure qemu), the 
guest will trap into the kernel (which marks the page dirty), and then 
resumes execution.

In addition to relying on hardware virtualization, kvm has two additional 
advantages:

<ul>
<li>
it relies on the kernel for the stuff the kernel is good at: scheduling, 
memory management, security, I/O, power management; the list goes on and 
on.
</li>
<li>
it relies on qemu for the stuff qemu is good at: emulation.  kvm only 
uses the chipset and I/O emulation (and not the cpu emulation), but a 
world of work was saved by using qemu.  Live migration, for example, is 
actually a qemu project which was adapted to also support kvm.
</li>
</ul>

By relying on the kernel and qemu, kvm is able to focus firmly on 
virtualization issues.  That is what makes the fast development pace 
possible.

Well, er, yes.
</p>

<p>
It could also be interpreted as an mean and underhanded swipe at other 
virtualization projects which have written their own kernel.  I'm sure no 
one on LWN would suggest that I'd make such an insinuation, though.

      Actually, I consider relying on hardware virtualization the smallest advantage of all.  Even if the paravirtualization approach makes sense - and in many cases it does - there is no reason to re-implement a scheduler, memory management, hardware-bug workarounds, etc.<br>
<p>
The ultimate hypervisor is the Linux kernel and kvm is the first widely-available project to take advantage of it.<br>

      ''guest systems can be moved between Intel and AMD processors with no problems at all.''<br>
<p>
What about those programs that use different instructions depending on the CPU ? These generally detect the CPU type when they start, but after a migration they will fail - since they don't redetect again.<br>

      Programs detect cpu capabilities by means of the cpuid instruction.  Since <br>
that instruction is itself virtualized and controlled by the host <br>
userspace, one can tell virtualize a processor with the least capabilities <br>
that are in use on the server farm.  Gievn that, programs will only use <br>
instructions that are present on all processors that can be a migration <br>
target.<br>

The kernel's <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/kexec.8.html">kexec
mechanism</a> allows one kernel to directly boot a new one; it can be
thought of as a sort of kernel equivalent to the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"><tt>execve()</tt></a>
system call.  Kexec has a number of uses, including booting a special kernel
to perform dumps after a crash.  Normally, one does not expect user-space
processes to survive booting into a new kernel, but that has not stopped
developers from trying to implement that ability.  Mike Rapoport ran a
memory-management-track session at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit to discuss one piece of that problem:
enabling the contents of memory to persist across a kexec handover so that
the new kernel can pick up where the old one left off.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
The use case that is being worked on is to allow large cloud providers to
update the kernel on a system hosting virtual machines without disturbing
those machines in the process.  The proposed new subsystem to enable this
functionality is called <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20250320015551.2157511-1-changyuanl@google.com/">Kexec
HandOver</a>, or KHO, but KHO needs layers on top to implement the
persistence of memory contents, and how that will work is not yet entirely
clear.  There has to be some way for the system to serialize and
deserialize state, and a controlling state machine to manage the whole
procedure.  One partial solution, called <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20250307005830.65293-1-ptyadav@amazon.de/">FDBox</a>,
can preserve file descriptors, mostly associated with in-memory objects
like memfds.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016000/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/MikeRapoport-sm.png" alt="[Mike Rapoport]"
title="Mike Rapoport" class="lthumb"></a>

The KHO layer is meant to provide the needed serialization mechanism and to
preserve the contents of non-movable memory ranges.  Outside of those
ranges, it will create scratch areas that the replacement kernel can use
for early allocation without stepping on the preserved memory contents.
There are several of these scratch areas, one of which is global, one in
low memory for devices with DMA limitations, and one per NUMA node.  These
areas are reserved when the second kernel boots; once the boot process is
complete, the scratch areas can be turned into <a
href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous memory allocator (CMA)</a> regions.
<p>
Subsystems that need to preserve memory across a boot will have to mark it
specifically with calls to functions like <tt>kho_preserve_folio()</tt>.
There may eventually be a call to preserve slab-allocated memory as well.
When the second kernel boots, it will mark the preserved areas as reserved
and not set up the memory map for them until the preserved memory is
claimed.  As the regions are claimed, the physical memory they occupy will
be configured to look as if it had been allocated from the second kernel's
buddy allocator.
<p>
There are, Rapoport allowed, some "<q>minor issues</q>" with this whole
scheme.  This handover dance is expected to happen repeatedly over time,
not just once, and that leads to problems with the management of the
scratch areas.  They can only be allocated when a handover is called for,
and the outgoing kernel can only guess at how much memory the new kernel
will need.  The availability of memory for the scratch areas will depend on
how fragmented memory has become on the old system; it may not be possible
to set aside as much memory as the outgoing kernel thinks is needed.  If
the resulting scratch areas are insufficient for the new kernel, the
handover will fail badly.  There are currently not a lot of good ideas
circulating on how to address this problem.
<p>
The handover mechanism currently cannot preserve movable memory, since the
preserved pages cannot be in a scratch area.  So, eventually, movable pages
will have to be migrated out of scratch areas (which may not be possible,
as was <a href="/Articles/1015551/">discussed</a> earlier that day), then
pinned in their new location to prevent them from being moved back.
Restoring folios will become harder as the transition to memory descriptors
goes forward, but that is a problem for 2026, he said.  Matthew Wilcox said
that drivers should be allocating pages, not folios, so the problem might
not be that bad.  Jason Gunthorpe said, though, that drivers for I/O
memory-management units will be allocating <a
href="/Articles/937839/">page-table descriptors</a>, which will complicate
the story.
<p>
The biggest problem, Rapoport concluded, is making this whole handover
process fast.  Preserving random pages is expensive, and the best data
structure to use for that task is not clear, though <a
href="/Articles/845507/">maple trees</a> look promising.  There may be a
need to coalesce memory to be preserved at allocation time as a way to
reduce the cost of preserving it, perhaps requiring the use of a new GFP
flag.  Performance would also be helped if the maintenance of memory blocks
could be bypassed during deserialization.
<p>
As the discussion wound down, Gunthorpe said that performance may not be as
big a problem as it seems.  The target systems for KHO are likely to be
using a lot of 1GB huge pages, so memory will not fragment that much.
There are, meanwhile, a lot of questions yet about how much memory really
needs to be preserved; he suggested getting the functionality working, then
reevaluating performance questions afterward.  Liam Howlett threw in a
final suggestion that maybe the existing hibernation mechanism could be
used rather than implementing an entirely new handover subsystem, but
Rapoport thought that any solution using hibernate would be far too slow.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

KHO doesn't need to handle the dump/restore step hibernation does, but I'd expect restoring the userspace to a kernel with a new code to have to do /more/ work.<br>

If the suspend/resume functionality is too slow, wouldn't it be best for speed improvements to benefit both cases by using the same infrastructure?<br>

I'm genuinely surprised to see the major cloud providers going for this approach. My impression was that they all already support live migration in a way that is relatively transparent to users: you start copying pages to the new host while the VM keeps running on the old one, and at some point you flip it to the new host, and maybe do postcopy migration for a bit, and then you can reboot the old host at your leisure. You might have to slow or pause the VM so its execution doesn't outpace your ability to copy pages, and there's probably some brief user-visible interruption at the moment of migration, but my impression is that it's relatively quick and often happens in the background.<br>
<p>
KHO has to pause user workloads for at least as long as it takes to boot up a kernel and initialize hardware, no? It seems like that has to incur much more user-visible disruption.<br>
<p>
I would love to know more about why they determined this was a worthwhile technical approach.<br>
<p>
I do recall that they can't live-migrate cloud VMs with GPUs, because the physical GPUs don't support live-migrating their state in a transparent way the way you can live-migrate CPU state (registers and memory). In this situation, I can see KHO saving you from that, especially if the GPU is fully passed through so the host doesn't interact with it / doesn't have GPU drivers at all. Is that the use case? Is that simpler than working with the GPU vendors to support live migration (which would be useful in other situations, e.g. hardware maintenance)?<br>

Live migration is not magic. You need to guarantee all of the following properties:<br>
<p>
* At some instant, the old instance of the guest stops running.<br>
* At some (later) instant, the new instance of the guest starts running OR the old instance is resumed (if the new instance fails to start for whatever reason, we must ensure there is still a guest instance running, and only then retry if desired).<br>
* No external system can observe both guests running simultaneously, or observe any discrepancy between them. In theory, this does not mean that you can't run multiple concurrent instances of the guest (as long as nobody ever sees them), but actually doing that in practice is not likely to work out, because...<br>
* Guests may do anything, so we have to assume they will do everything. For example, the guest may call out to a third party over the network, have a complicated mixed-TCP-and-UDP conversation in some proprietary protocol that we know nothing about, concurrently read and write to persistent storage as part of said protocol, execute RDRAND instructions like they're going out of fashion, run Wireshark and other pervasive logging at both ends, and then forensically examine every single log and other scrap of information they can possibly get their hands on, looking for even the smallest bit of evidence that we were running two guests at some point. A robust implementation should pass that sort of inspection. While I can just about picture a hypervisor managing to pass this sort of test (with a lot of highly invasive I/O simulation and replaying), I can't imagine it possibly being more performant than just stopping the guest and starting it again.<br>
<p>
More realistically, I think you have to do a full Paxos or Raft transaction to hand off the "which guest is allowed to execute" bit, and that's assuming that page copying turns out to not be a big problem. If the guest is in the habit of dirtying pages rapidly, then it gets worse from there.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; KHO has to pause user workloads for at least as long as it takes to boot up a kernel and initialize hardware, no? It seems like that has to incur much more user-visible disruption.</span><br>
<p>
That depends on three factors:<br>
<p>
* What is the absolute latest that the old kernel has to stop scheduling userspace threads?<br>
* What is the absolute earliest that the new kernel can start scheduling userspace threads?<br>
* How do those numbers compare to the live migration numbers in practice?<br>
<p>
In the most wildly optimistic scenario (which I assume is unachievable in practice), the answer would be that there is no disruption at all: While the new kernel is booting, it is cooperatively multitasked with the old kernel, and as each subsystem comes up, the old kernel progressively hands more and more of its responsibilities off to the new kernel, until eventually the old kernel isn't doing anything anymore.<br>
<p>
I presume you can't really do that. The kernel, to my understanding, was not designed under the assumption that half of its subsystems might be Somebody Else's Problem at any given time (nor that we're cooperatively multitasking with a second kernel), so progressively handing off control is probably not a state transition that has been seriously contemplated. But if you can't unify those two events, you can at least try to squeeze them closer together:<br>
<p>
1. Delay shutting down the old kernel for as long as possible.<br>
2. Complete boot-to-init faster (in the new kernel).<br>
<p>
Passing through hardware to the guest is one obvious way of making (2) better (less hardware means you have less to do), but I'm pretty sure there's a whole bag of tricks you can use there (e.g. the root filesystem is a tiny EROFS-like thing that's just barely large enough to support a functional userland, any real storage is accessed through a higher-level application protocol that the kernel doesn't need to care about, everything the kernel needs is on SSD or even in-memory, there are no peripherals because we're a headless box in a rack, etc.). I do have to wonder if you can get any mileage out of (1), though.<br>

Live migration is neat, but it's not a solution to everything, won't work with all types of virtualisation, and no matter how polished you get it there is always some kind of pause, and customers do notice.<br>
<p>
Consider scenarios where the cloud provides instances with local NVMe drives, for example.  Live migrating multiple NVMe drives worth of data between servers is neither trivial, nor fast (especially if you're trying to avoid impact on the running instance's actual workload.)   Live-patching is great, but not a total solution, only covers a subset of packages and the kernel, and all of the solutions carry some form of caveat due to how the patching works.  You can't guarantee that any patch is a 100% mitigation.  The safest and best thing to do is reboot into the new kernel.  If it's possible to do that with split second-ish impact on the running instance, that's all the better.<br>

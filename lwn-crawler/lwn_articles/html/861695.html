           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 12, 2021</br>
           </div>
The 5.14 merge window closed with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjB5XBk4obhMPfrU3mnOakV9VgHAYOo-ZGJnB2X0DnBWA@mail.gmail.com/">5.14-rc1</a>
release on July&nbsp;11.  By that time, some 12,981 non-merge changesets had
been pulled into the mainline repository; nearly 8,000 of those arrived
after <a href="/Articles/861248/">the first LWN 5.14 merge-window summary</a>
was written.  This merge window has thus seen fewer commits than its
predecessor, which saw 14,231 changesets before the 5.13-rc1 release.  That
said, there is still a lot of interesting work that has found its way into
the kernel this time around.
<p>
Some of the more significant changes pulled in the second half of the 5.14
merge window include:
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The s390 architecture now supports booting kernels compressed with
     the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstandard</a> (zstd)
     algorithm.
<li> The RISC-V architecture has gained support for transparent huge pages
     and support for the <a href="/Articles/835542/">KFENCE</a>
     memory-safety checker.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/855049/">control-group kill button</a> patch
     set has been merged; this feature allows the quick killing of all
     members of a control group by writing to the <tt>cgroup.kill</tt>
     virtual control file.
<li> There are two new options for the <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
     system call:
     <p>
     <ul class="spacylist">
     <li> <tt>MADV_POPULATE_READ</tt> will fault in all pages within the
     	  indicated mapping for read access; the effect is the same as if
     	  the caller had manually looped through the range, accessing each
     	  page.  No COW mappings will be broken by this operation.
     <li> <tt>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE</tt>, instead, will fault in the pages
     	  for write access, breaking COW mappings if need be.
     </ul>
     <p>
     The purpose of these operations, in either case, is to pay the cost of
     faulting in a range of memory immediately, allowing the
     application to run without page-fault-induced delays later on.  They
     differ from the <tt>MAP_POPULATE</tt> option to <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
     in that they can be invoked at any time rather than just when the
     memory is mapped.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4ca9b3859dac">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/835342/"><tt>memfd_secret()</tt></a> system
     call has been merged.  It creates a region of memory that is private
     to the caller; even the kernel cannot directly access it.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1507f51255c9">this commit</a> for a
     bit more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The ext4 filesystem has gained a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
     called <tt>EXT4_IOC_CHECKPOINT</tt>.  This command forces all pending
     transactions out of the journal, and can also overwrite the space on
     the storage device used by the journal.  This operation is part of <a
     href="/Articles/854054/">an effort</a> to prevent information leaks
     from filesystems.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fd7b23be9205">This documentation
     commit</a> describes the new operation and its options.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/859679/"><tt>quotactl_fd()</tt> system call</a>
     has been added.  This is the new form of <tt>quotactl_path()</tt> that
     was briefly added to 5.13 before being disabled as the result of API
     concerns.
<li> The F2FS filesystem can now compress files that are mapped with
     <tt>mmap()</tt>.  There is also a new <tt>nocompress_extension</tt>
     mount option that disables compression for any file whose name matches
     the given extension(s).
</ul>

<p>

     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/bce29ac9ce0b">osnoise</a> and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a955d7eac177">timerlat</a> commits
     have more details and instructions on how to use these features.
</ul>
<p>

The 5.14 kernel is now in the stabilization phase.  Unless something highly
unusual happens, the final 5.14 release will happen on August&nbsp;29 or
September&nbsp;5.  There is a lot of testing and bug-fixing to be done in
the meantime.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In some of my programs I allocate memory with specific properties:<br>
<p>
mmap(MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS)<br>
mbind() to a specific NUMA node<br>
set other madvise flags (MADV_HUGEPAGE, MADV_DONTDUMP, MADV_DONTFORK, etc.)<br>
prefault in the pages manually by looping over the allocation and reading at PAGE_SIZE-intervals<br>
<p>
A long time ago (many kernels ago), I found that prefaulting is needed because just doing a system call like read() and passing the buffer without prefaulting from userspace doesn&#x27;t always obey mbind() policy.  I once tried using mlock() to prefault the pages, but that ignored the mbind() policy also (again with old kernels).<br>
<p>
So do these new MADV_POPULATE_* obey mbind() policy?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; &quot;by looping over the allocation and reading at PAGE_SIZE-intervals&quot;</font><br>
<p>
Are you sure that you are *reading* and not writing? On anonymous memory, reading will simply populate the shared zeropage, so I&#x27;d be surprised if it (no populated page vs. populated shared zeropage) makes a real difference when later reading from that mapping (read() ...), or even when writing to it (write() ...) in your example.<br>
<p>
mlock(), MAP_POPULATE and the new MADV_POPULATE_READ and MADV_POPULATE_WRITE options nowadays all end up calling handle_mm_fault() -- the very basic fault handler also called on page faults on the faulting CPU. So I&#x27;d be surprised if they behave differently-- but I&#x27;ll double check.<br>
<p>
Note that there are subtle differences when it comes to shared mappings: mlock() and MAP_POPULATE won&#x27;t trigger COW on shared mappings. But for your example, mmap(MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS), the mbind() documentation is quite clear: &quot;pages will be allocated only according to the specified policy when the application writes (stores) to the page.  For anonymous regions, an initial read access will use a shared page in the kernel containing all  zeros. &quot;. And I&#x27;d assume that holds for any allocations, also when triggering writes from other CPUs, e.g., as part of a syscall.<br>

I just double-checked, and you are correct, my code does write to the memory, and the comment even says that it is to break the COW mapping so that the memory is actually allocated, so my previous comment was in error.<br>

Makes sense! QEMU similarly reads+writes one byte of each page when told to preallocate guest memory; the read+write is in place to trigger COW, but to not overwrite existing data, for example, when some piece of guest memory corresponds to a virtual NVDIMM.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, I verified that MADV_POPULATE_* and mbind() works as expected.<br>

I am a Kernel noob, was just wondering what/if there are downsides to increasing the number of syscalls? Is there a worry about far too much fragmentation amongst syscalls? I guess if I was to make a bad comparison, I&#x27;m aware that the x86 instruction set is massive, and people like Chris Domas have done research and found hidden instructions due to the size of the instruction set. Again, I want to reiterate that I know this is a bad example, but I&#x27;m just trying to illustrate a point.<br>

I think if new functionality is desired and can be clearly delineated, then it’s no worse than other systems growing larger.  It has costs.   But nothing enormous.<br>

The cost is primarily technical, not really about performance. There might be some small cache effects if you call way too much different code, but it&#x27;s unlikely to be a big deal.<br>

the cost would be higher in an OS less focused on portability than linux.<br>
Since linux tends to use its own syscall dispatching over old limited syscall mechanisms, were you use a hardware instruction with an immediate syscall number, which tend to be quite limited.<br>
<p>
for example x86-32 used int80h all syscalls, while some non portable systems might want to avoid dispatching inside the int80h handler and instead spread syscalls over the interupts, then if you run out of interupt numbers, you have a cost increase. Linux uses dispatiching anyways, so there is no big cost to have a thousand syscalls, besides someone having to maintain them all and the desire to basically never break even a single one<br>

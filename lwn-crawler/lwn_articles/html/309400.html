           </div>
An I/O scheduler is a subsystem of the kernel which schedules I/O
operations to
the various storage devices to get the best possible throughput from those
devices.
The algorithm is often reminiscent of the algorithm used by elevators when
dealing with requests coming from different floors to go up or down.
This is the reason I/O scheduling algorithms are also called
"elevators." I/O requests are submitted in an order designed to minimize
disk head movement (thus minimizing disk seek times), yet guaranteeing
good I/O rates. The next request chosen will be dependent on the current
disk head position, in order to service the requests quickly, and spend
less time seeking, or moving the disk head. However, algorithms
may also consider other aspects such as fairness or time guarantees. 
<p>
The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler, is one of the most popular I/O
scheduling algorithms; it is used as the default scheduler in most
distributions. As the name suggests, the CFQ scheduler tries to
maintain fairness in its distribution of bandwidth to processes, and yet does not
compromise much on the throughput. The elevator's fairness is
accomplished by servicing all processes and not penalizing those
which have requests far from the current disk head position.
It grants a time slice to every process; 
once the task has consumed its slice, this slice is recomputed and task is
added to the end of the queue. 
The I/O priority is used to compute the time slice granted and the offset
in the request queue.
<p>
<h3>The Budget Fair Queuing scheduler</h3>
<p>
The time-based allocation of the disk service in CFQ, while having
the desirable effect of implicitly charging each application for
the seek time it incurs, still suffers from fairness problems, especially
towards processes which make the best possible use of the disk bandwidth.
If the same time slice is assigned to two processes,
they may each get different throughput, as a function of the
positions on the disk of their requests.  Moreover, due
to its round robin policy, CFQ is characterized by an O(N) worst-case
delay (jitter) in request completion time, where N is the number
of tasks competing for the disk.  
<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/306641/">Budget Fair Queuing (BFQ) 
scheduler</a>, developed by Fabio Checconi and Paolo Valente,
changes the CFQ round-robin scheduling policy based on time slices into a
fair queuing policy based on sector budgets.  Each task is assigned a budget
measured in number of sectors instead of amount of time, and budgets
are scheduled using a slightly modified version of the Worst-case Fair
Weighted Fair Queuing+ (WF2Q+) algorithm (described in <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang/papers/TON-97-Oct.ps.gz">this paper
[compressed PS]</a>), which
guarantees a worst case complexity of O(logN) and boils down to O(1)
in most cases. The budget assigned to each task varies over time as a
function of its behavior.  However, one can set the maximum value of
the budget that BFQ can assign to any task.
<p>
BFQ can provide strong guarantees on bandwidth distribution because the
assigned budgets are measured  sectors. There are limits, though: processes
spending 
too much time to exhaust their budget are penalized and the scheduler
selects the next process to dispatch I/O. The next budget is
calculated on the feedback provided by the request serviced.
<p>
BFQ also introduces I/O scheduling within control groups. Queues are collected
into a tree of groups, and there is a distinct B-WF2Q+ scheduler on each
non-leaf node. Leaf nodes are request queues as in the
non-hierarchical case. BFQ supports I/O priority classes at each hierarchy
level, enforcing a strict priority ordering among classes. This means
that idle queues or groups are served only if there are no best effort
queues or groups in the same control group, and best effort queues and groups are
served only if there are no real-time queues or groups. As compared to
cfq-cgroups (explained later), it lacks per device priorities. The
developers however claim that this feature can be incorporated easily.
<p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>
Requests coming to an I/O scheduler fall into two categories,
synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous requests are those for which
the application must wait before continuing to send further
requests - typically read requests. On the other hand, asynchronous
requests - typically writes - do not block the application's progress while
they are executed.
In BFQ, as in CFQ, synchronous requests are collected in per-task queues, while
asynchronous requests are collected in per-device (or, in the case of
hierarchical scheduling, per group) queues. 
<p>
When the underlying device
driver asks for the next request to serve and there is no queue being
served, BFQ uses B-WF2Q+, a modified version of WF2Q+, to choose a
queue. It then selects the first request from that queue in C-LOOK order
and returns it to the driver. C-LOOK is a disk scheduling algorithm,
where the next request picked is the one with the immediate next highest
disk sector to the current position of the disk head. Once the disk 
has serviced the maximum sector number in the request queue, it
positions the head to the sector number of the request having the
lowest sector number.
<p>
When a new queue is selected it is assigned a budget, in disk sector
units, decremented each time a request from the same queue is served.
When the device driver asks for new requests and there is a queue
under service, they are chosen from that queue until one of the
following conditions is met: (1)&nbsp;the queue exhausts its budget,
(2)&nbsp;the queue is spending too much time to consume its budget, or
(3)&nbsp;the queue has no more requests to serve
<p>
On termination of a request, the scheduler recalculates the
budget allocated to each process depending on the feedback it gets.
For example, for greedy processes which have exhausted their budgets,
the budget is increased, whereas if it has been idle for long, its
budget is decreased. The maximum budget a process can get is a
configurable system parameter (<tt>max_budget</tt>).  
Two other parameters, <tt>timeout_sync</tt> and <tt>timeout_async</tt>,
control the timeout time for consuming the budget of the synchronous and
asynchronous 
queues respectively. In addition, <tt>max_budget_async_rq</tt> limits the
maximum number of requests serviced from an asynchronous queue.
<p>
If a synchronous queue has no more requests to serve, but it has
some budget left, the scheduler idles (i.e., it tells to the device
driver that it has no requests to serve even if there are other active
queues) for a short period, in anticipation of a new request from the task
owning the queue.
<p>

<h3>Test Results</h3>
<p>
The developers <a
href="http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/">compared</a>  six different I/O scheduling algorithms: 
BFQ, <a
href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/full_papers/bruno/bruno_html/node10.html">YFQ</a>,
SCAN-EDF, CFQ, the Linux anticipatory scheduler, and C-LOOK.
They compared a multitude of test scenarios analogous to
real-life scenarios, including throughput, bandwidth distribution,
latency, and short-term time
guarantees. With respect to bandwidth distribution, BFQ can be
concluded as the best, and a good algorithm for most scenarios.
There were also extensive tests comparing BFQ against CFQ, and the
results are available <a
href="http://feanor.sssup.it/~fabio/linux/bfq/results.php">here</a>.
The throughput of BFQ is more or less the same as CFQ, but it scores well in
distributing I/O bandwidth fairly among the processes, and  displays
lower latency with streaming data.
<p>
Using sector budgets instead of time as a factor of granting slice 
for fair bandwidth distribution is an interesting concept.
The algorithm also employs timeouts to terminate requests of "seeky"
processes taking too much time to consume their budget and penalizes
them. The feedback from current requests help determine future
budgets, making the algorithm self-learning. Such tighter bandwidths
distribution would be a requirement for systems running virtual
machines, or container classes. However, it depends on how BFQ stands
the test of time against the tried-and-tested stable CFQ.

<h3>Expanded CFQ</h3>
<p>
Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating sets of tasks, and
all their future children, into hierarchical groups. These groups can
be allocated dedicated portions of the available resources, or
resource sharing can be prioritized within these groups. Control
groups are controlled by the cgroups pseudo-filesystem. Once mounted,
the top level directory shows the complete set of existing control
groups. Each directory made 
under the root filesystem makes a new group, and resources can be
allocated to the tasks listed in the <tt>tasks</tt> file in the individual
groups directory.
<p>
Control groups can be used to regulate access to CPU time, memory, and
more.  There are also several projects working toward the creation of I/O
bandwidth controllers for control groups.
One of those is
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/306772/">expanded CFQ scheduler
patch for cgroups</a> by Satoshi Uchida.

This patch set introduces a new I/O scheduler called <tt>cfq-cgroups</tt>,
which 
introduces cgroups for the I/O scheduling subsystem. 

<p>
This scheduler, as
the name suggests, is based on Completely Fair Queuing I/O scheduler.
It can take advantage of hierarchical scheduling of
processes, with respect to the cgroup they belong to, each cgroup
having its own CFQ scheduler.
I/O devices in a control group can be prioritized. The time slice
given to each hierarchical group per device is a function of the device
priority. This helps shaping of I/O bandwidth per group, per device.
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
To use, cfq-cgroups, select it as a default scheduler at
boot by passing <tt>elevator=cfq-cgroups</tt> as a boot parameter.
This can also be dynamically changed for individual devices by writing
<tt>cfq-cgroups</tt> to <tt>/sys/block/&lt;device&gt;/queue/scheduler</tt>.
There are two levels of control:
through the cgroups filesystem, for individual groups, and
through sysfs, for individual devices.
<p>
Like any other control group, cfq-cgroup is managed through the
cgroup pseudo-filesystem.
To access the cgroups, mount the pseudo cgroups filesystem:
<p>
<pre>
    # mount -t cgroup -o cfq cfq /mnt/cgroup
</pre>
<p>
The cgroup directory, by default, will have a file called
<tt>cfq.ioprio</tt>, which contains  the
individual priority on a per-device basis. The time slice received per
device per group is a function of the I/O priority listed in <tt>cfq.ioprio</tt>.
The <tt>tasks</tt> file represents the list of tasks in the particular group.
To make more groups, create a directory in the mounted cgroup
directory:
<p>
<pre>
    # mkdir /mnt/cgroup/group1
</pre>
<p>
The new directories are automatically populated with files,
<tt>cfq.ioprio</tt>, <tt>tasks</tt> etc, which are used to control the
resources in this 
group. To add tasks in a group, write the process ID of the task to the
<tt>tasks</tt> file:
<p>
<pre>
    #echo &lt;pid&gt; &gt; /mnt/cgroup/group1/tasks
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>cfq.ioprio</tt> file contains the list of devices and their respective
priorities. Each device in the cgroup has a default I/O priority of 3,
while the valid values are 0 to 7. To change the priority of a device for
the cgroup group1, run:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 2 &gt; /mnt/cgroup/group1/cfq.ioprio
</pre>
<p>
This would change the priority of the entire group. To change the I/O
priority of a specific device:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 2 sda &gt; /mnt/cgroup/group1/cfq.ioprio
</pre>
<p>
To change the default priority while keeping the priority of the
devices unchanged:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 4 defaults &gt; /mnt/cgroup/group1/cfq.ioprio
</pre>
<p>
The device view shows the list of cgroups and their respective
priorities on a per-group basis. This can be changed by:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 2 group1 &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/ioprio
</pre>
<p>
The device view contain other parameters similar to the CFQ scheduler,
such as <tt>back_seek_max</tt> or <tt>back_seek_penalty</tt>, which are
specific to the control of the individual device, same as the traditional
CFQ. 
<p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
The patch introduces a new data structure called <tt>cfq_driver_data</tt>
for the 
control of I/O bandwidth for cgroups. All driver-related data has been
moved from the traditional <tt>cfq_data</tt> structure to
<tt>cfq_driver_data</tt> structure. Similarly, <tt>cfq_cgroups</tt> is a new data
structure to control 
the cgroup parameters. The organization of data can be assumed as
a matrix with <tt>cfq_cgroups</tt> as rows and <tt>cfq_driver_data</tt> as
columns, as 
shown in the diagram below. 
<p>
<blockquote>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/cfq-cgroup.png" width=439 height=220 hspace=2
alt="[cfq-cgroup diagram]">
</blockquote>
<p>
At each intersection, there is a <tt>cfqd_data</tt>
structure which is responsible for all CFQ related queue handling, so
that each <tt>cfq_data</tt> corresponds to  one <tt>cfq_cgroup</tt> and
<tt>cfq_driver_data</tt> combination.
<p>
When a new cgroup is created, the  cfq_data from
the parent cgroup is copied into the new group.  While inserting new nodes
of <tt>cfq_data</tt> into the 
cgroup, the <tt>cfq_data</tt> structure is initialized with the priority of
the <tt>cfq_cgroup</tt>.
This way all data of the parent is inherited by the child cgroup, and
shows up in the respective files per group in the cgroup filesystem.
<p>
Scheduling of <tt>cfq_data</tt> within the CFQ scheduler is similar to that
of the native CFQ scheduler. Each node is assigned a time slice.
This slice is calculated according to the I/O priority of the device, using
the per-device base time slice.  The time slice offset forms the key of
the red-black node to be inserted in the service tree.  One
<tt>cfq_data</tt> entry is
picked from the start of the red-black tree and scheduled.  Once its
time slice expires it is added to the tree again, after recalculation
of its time slice offset. So, each <tt>cfq_data</tt> structure acts as a
queue node per 
device, and, within each CFQ data structure, requests are queued as with a
regular CFQ queue. 
<p>
Both BFQ and cfq-cgroups are attempts to bring a higher degree of fairness
to I/O scheduling, with "fairness" being tempered by the desire to add more
administrative control via the control groups mechanism.  They both appear
to be useful solutions, but they must contend with the wealth of other I/O
bandwidth control implementations out there.  Coming to some sort of
consensus on which approach is the right one could prove to be a rather
longer process than simply implementing these algorithms in the first place.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I recall Ingo arguing against a plugin architecture for the CPU scheduler, and saying something along the lines of "The disk scheduler people probably regret making theirs pluggable".  I don't remember his exact words and nor can I find where he said it, so this is a para-phrase.<br>
<p>
Maybe they do.  But this demonstrates the sort of innovation that can happen once you expose a stable API.  At the very least I imagine much of the infighting we see around the CPU scheduler would have gone away if Ingo had seen fit to loosen his control of the CPU scheduler by doing the same thing.<br>

There is a good reason to make IO schedulers pluggable: different media may need different scheduling. The canonical example is the flash vs. disk. It makes no sense to calculate optimal write order, or delay IO for flash.<br>
<p>
In principle, I personally prefer one relatively well working piece of code over plenty of choice. There is also the argument that code can be written against a particular scheduling model. In a way, the situation is the opposite of what you said: the current unchangeable scheduler creates a stable API for *userland*, which is where the clients of scheduler are.<br>
<p>
An example: When the 2.6 kernel arrived, it changed the way yield() operations on threads work, causing some applications to slow down drastically. Imagine if you had had choice of 3 different schedulers, and need to run app A which wants yield() behavior of one scheduler, and app B that wants the yield() of another. It could mean that you might not be able to use these two apps at the same time.<br>

<p>
If those were the candidates, I would agree.  But in reality, there's a perfectly viable third candidate: plenty of choice, in which one option is something that works relatively well for everyone.

Err, but there's been, like, astonishingly huge amounts of CPU scheduler innovation in Linux? Hacking the source is not really harder than implementing a stable API, you just lose other conveniences like choosing which scheduler at run time.<br>
<p>
And in-fighting wouldn't be reduced; it would just shift to fighting over which scheduler got to be the Default, instead of which got to be the One And Only.  If anything that would just make things worse, because you'd make it easier for the competing camps to co-exist over a long period and get Bitter, instead of pushing them to come to a resolution one way or another and combine efforts.<br>

      <blockquote>
The algorithm is often reminiscent of the algorithm used by elevators when dealing with requests coming from different floors to go up or down. This is the reason I/O scheduling algorithms are also called "elevators."
</blockquote>
<p>
Is that how Linux users use the term?  If so, I know that's not the reason.  The reason would be simple confusion.
<p>
The classic disk scheduling algorithm is called "elevator" because it is the very algorithm that all primitive elevators use: keep moving in one direction until there is no more work in that direction, then turn around and do the same thing in the other direction.  The term was coined to refer to that specific algorithm, not the concept of disk I/O scheduling.
<p>
It's probably best just to use the term "disk I/O scheduler" for a disk I/O scheduler, to avoid confusion.

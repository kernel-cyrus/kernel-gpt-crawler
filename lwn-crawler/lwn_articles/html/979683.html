Like many kernel subsystems, the Linux security module (LSM) subsystem
makes extensive use of indirect function calls.  Those calls, however, are
increasingly problematic, and the pressure to remove them has been growing. 
The good news is that there is <a
href="/ml/all/20240629084331.3807368-1-kpsingh@kernel.org">a patch
series</a> from KP Singh that accomplishes that goal.  Its progress into
the mainline has been slow — this change was first <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20200820164753.3256899-1-jackmanb@chromium.org/">proposed</a>
by Brendan Jackman and Paul Renauld in 2020 — and this work has been caught
up in some wider controversies along the way, but it should be close to
being ready.
<p>
A security module provides a set of hooks, one for each operation within
the kernel that it wants to control.  Whenever that operation (opening a
file, for example, or creating a new process) is invoked by user space, the
security module's hook function will be called with information about the
requested action.  The hook then has the opportunity to see whether an
action is allowed by the policy it is meant to enforce and, if not, block
that action.  The kernel can have more than one security module active at a
time, each of which provides its own hook functions.  Those functions are
stored in a linked list; traversing that list and calling all of the hook
functions is where the indirect calls come in.
<p>
Calling functions through pointers is, of course, a common C-language
technique that is used heavily throughout the kernel.  These indirect
function calls have increasingly come under scrutiny in recent years,
mostly as a result of the threat posed by the Spectre class of hardware
vulnerabilities.  Indirect function calls can be points where a number of
speculative-execution vulnerabilities can be exploited.  The gyrations
required to thwart such exploits — notably <a
href="/Articles/774743/">retpolines</a> — come with a heavy run-time cost.
<p>
That added cost is especially painful when it comes to the indirect
function calls used by security modules.  Almost anything that user space
can do, if it involves the kernel, will be mediated by at least one
security-module hook; if those hooks are made more expensive, the pain is
felt throughout the system.  The added performance hit is prohibitive on
systems that are already running at full capacity, with the result that the
use of security modules is not possible for some workloads.  It is thus not
surprising that there is interest in getting that lost performance back.
<p>
The attention to security modules increased in April with the <a
href="/Articles/969210/">disclosure</a> of the branch history injection
hardware vulnerability, which is, once again, exploitable in code using
indirect function calls.  The LSM subsystem is, arguably, an especially
appealing target for such exploits because it makes so many indirect calls,
its hooks are attached to almost every system call, and the LSM call is
often one of the first things done on entry into the kernel.
<p>

This vulnerability forced the use of retpolines on CPUs that had,
previously, been able to get away with less-expensive mitigations provided
by the hardware.  That provoked <a href="/Articles/970070/">a touchy
conversation</a> with Linus Torvalds, who questioned the direction that the
LSM subsystem had been taking for the last ten years.  In the middle of
that, though, he also <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHk-=wh+_xXpnHfUv=FwGWcce4XwqwKvtq7LcxK6WKmbf4eGGA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that the work to switch the LSM subsystem to using static calls "<q>needs
to be turned to&nbsp;11</q>"; that was the one part of Torvalds's
message that nobody disagreed with strongly.
<p>
<h4>Static calls</h4>
<p>
Static calls are widely used within the kernel in situations where an
indirect call is necessary, but the target for that call is set only once
(or at most rarely) in the life of the system.  Their purpose is to provide
the flexibility of indirect calls (albeit with an increased cost for
changing the target of the call) with the improved performance and security
of direct calls.    The static-call infrastructure was first <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/115284d89a43">added for the 5.9 kernel
release</a> in 2020; it is conspicuously absent from the kernel's
documentation, but there is an overview of the API in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10-rc5/source/include/linux/static_call.h"><tt>include/linux/static_call.h</tt></a>.
<p>
In the simplest case, kernel code will set up a static call with:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_STATIC_CALL(name, func);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>name</tt> is the name to be associated with the static call, and
<tt>func()</tt> is the function to be invoked.  The <tt>static_call()</tt>
macro can then be used to call the function:
<p>
<pre>
    static_call(name)(args...);
</pre>
<p>
This call will work like a normal function call; <tt>func()</tt> will be
called with the given <tt>args</tt>, and its return value will be passed
back to the caller.  It is, however, a <i>direct</i> call, much as if
<tt>func()</tt> had been called directly in the code.  As a result, this
call is faster than an indirect call and lacks the associated
speculative-execution problems.
<p>
The value of indirect calls, of course, is that the target can be changed
at run time; that is not normally the case with direct calls.  Static calls
use some architecture-specific trickery to get around this problem; if the
target of a static call needs to be changed, that can be done with a call
to:
<p>
<pre>
    static_call_update(name, new_func);
</pre>
<p>
After this call is made, a <tt>static_call(name)()</tt> invocation will
make a (direct) call to <tt>new_func()</tt> rather than <tt>func()</tt>.
<p>
How this mechanism is implemented depends on the architecture.  Some
architectures (arm and x86) are able to patch the call instructions
directly in line, meaning that static calls are indeed just like normal
direct calls and have no additional overhead.  That said, the cost of
patching the code in a running kernel is high, making suitable for
use only in situations where the function to be called will be changed
infrequently, if ever.  Other architectures need to use a special
trampoline for the static call; for architectures with no support at all,
ordinary indirect function calls are used.  There is more complexity to the
API than described here; see the above-linked header file for details.
<p>
<h4>Bringing static calls to LSMs</h4>
<p>
While the LSM subsystem is, as its name would suggest, modular, it is not
set up for the arbitrary loading and unloading of modules.  Instead, the
set of available security modules is established (through the kernel
configuration) at build time, and those modules are built directly into the
kernel image.  The set of <i>active</i> security modules is then defined at
boot time and never changes during the operation of the system.  So the set
of hook functions to be called can be worked out at boot time, and need
never be altered thereafter.  This seems like a situation that is well
suited to static calls; that is, indeed, the approach taken by Singh's
patch set.
<p>
In current kernels, as mentioned above, a linked list of hook functions is
maintained for each LSM hook; the kernel iterates through that list to
invoke each hook function with an indirect call.  With this patch series
applied, that linked list is replaced with an array of static calls; the
LSM subsystem now just has to step through the array, calling each hook in
turn.  In theory, the conversion should be straightforward.
In practice, of course, there turns out to be a few little details that get
in the way.
<p>
One of those details relates to the fact that an LSM need not supply
functions for every hook.  In the old implementation, a missing hook would
be absent from the linked list and would never be invoked, but an array
works differently.  It <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20220609234601.2026362-1-kpsingh@kernel.org/">turns
out</a> that providing a hook that returns the default value can have
unwanted side effects; it is <i>not</i> the same as leaving out the hook
entirely.  So each entry in the arrays of hook function must be protected
by a <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/staging/static-keys.html">static
key</a> to avoid calls when a hook function is absent.
<p>
There are other troublesome details as well.  The set of possible security
modules is defined in the kernel configuration and is known at boot time.
A command-line parameter is then used to control both which modules are
enabled and the order in which they are invoked.  The kernel must then, at
boot time, set up the requisite static calls in the correct order; the
number of these calls, and the order in which they must be made, cannot be
known ahead of time.  There is some trickiness and <a
href="/ml/all/20240516003524.143243-3-kpsingh@kernel.org">ugly macro
code</a> involved, but the result is an end to indirect calls for LSM
hooks.
<p>
The result of this work is a performance improvement that averages about 3%
and a system that, without all those indirect calls, is more secure overall.
<p>
This patch set has been through 13 revisions since Singh picked it up
at the beginning of 2023; it appears to have satisfied most reviewers.
Kees Cook <a href="/ml/all/202406061049.F2FD4F8A@keescook">asked</a> for it
to be merged soon, lest Torvalds return and "<q>make unilateral changes to
the LSM</q>".  But LSM subsystem maintainer Paul Moore <a
href="/ml/all/CAHC9VhQyy6u9O=KPE4vNR3FO+5ofGky8hw53jadxW2n0RyLd=g@mail.gmail.com">pushed
back</a>, saying that he simply has not had the time to review the current
version of the patches.  More than two months after the last discussion, it
seems that this is still a bit of a touchy subject.
<p>
Nearly three weeks later, nothing appears to have changed, so whether this
work will be applied in time for 6.11 is unclear.  If that doesn't happen,
though, a 6.12 merge seems almost certain (unless some sort of new problem
turns up).  Either way, the days of indirect calls in the LSM subsystem
would appear to be numbered.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

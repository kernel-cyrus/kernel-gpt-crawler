While it is sometimes possible to perform I/O by moving data through the
CPU, the only way to get the required level of performance is usually for devices
to move data directly to and from memory.  Direct memory access (DMA) I/O
has been well supported in the Linux kernel since the early days, but there
are always ways in which that support can be improved, especially when
hardware adds some challenges of its own.  The somewhat confusingly named
"non-contiguous" DMA API that 
was added for 5.13 shows the kinds of things that have to be done to get
the best performance on current systems.
<p>
DMA, of course, presents a number of interesting race conditions that can
arise in the absence of an agreement between the CPU and the device over who
controls a range of memory at any given time.  But there is another problem
that comes up as well.  CPUs aggressively cache memory contents to avoid
the considerable expense of actually going to memory for every reference.
But if a CPU has cached data that is subsequently overwritten by DMA, the
CPU could end up reading incorrect data from the cache, resulting in data
corruption. 
Similarly, if the cache contains data written by the CPU that has not yet
made it to memory, that data really needs to be flushed out before the
device accesses that memory or bad things are likely to happen.
<p>
The x86 architecture makes life relatively easy (in this regard, at least)
for kernel developers by providing cache snooping; CPU caches will be
invalidated if a device is seen to be writing to a range of memory, for
example.  This "cache-coherent" behavior means that developers need not
worry about cache contents corrupting their data.

Other architectures are not so forgiving.  The Arm architecture, among
others, will happily retain cache contents that no longer match the memory
they are allegedly caching.  On such systems, developers must take care to
manage the cache properly as control of a DMA buffer is passed between the
device and the CPU.
<p>
There are a number of ways to handle this task, but life gets harder if a
DMA buffer also requires extensive access by either the kernel or user
space.  One approach that is taken at times is to make that range of memory
uncached.  A nonexistent cache cannot corrupt data, but it can make it clear
why caches exist in the first place; accessing uncached memory can be
extremely slow.  If at all possible, it is better to avoid the uncached
mode.
<p>
The new API is a way to do that for some sorts of devices.  A driver can
allocate a DMA buffer using:
<p>
<pre>
    struct sg_table *dma_alloc_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
					     enum dma_data_direction direction,
					     gfp_t gfp, unsigned long attrs);
</pre>
<p>
This function will attempt to allocate <tt>size</tt> bytes of memory for
DMA by <tt>dev</tt> in the given <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.1/source/include/linux/dma-direction.h#L5"><tt>direction</tt></a>
using the given 
<tt>gfp</tt> flags.  That buffer may not be physically contiguous in system
memory, but the returned scatter/gather table will be set up with a single,
contiguous range for the DMA device.  An I/O memory-management unit (IOMMU)
is clearly required for the system to be able to arrange that; it's an
important feature, though, since some devices cannot do scatter/gather I/O
without IOMMU assistance.  The only accepted value for <tt>attrs</tt> is
<tt>DMA_ATTR_ALLOC_SINGLE_PAGES</tt>, which is a hint that it's not
worthwhile for the DMA-mapping code to try to use huge pages for this
buffer.
<p>
This buffer may well not be cache-coherent.  As with other noncoherent
mappings, cache management must be done by hand.  So, for example, a call
to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.1/source/include/linux/dma-mapping.h#L375"><tt>dma_sync_sgtable_for_device()</tt></a>
must be done before handing the 
memory over to the device for I/O; it will make sure that any dirty cache
lines will be flushed out to the memory, among other things.  To take
control back from the device, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.1/source/include/linux/dma-mapping.h#L356"><tt>dma_sync_sgtable_for_cpu()</tt></a>
must be called.
<p>
The buffer can be freed with:
<p>
<pre>
    void dma_free_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
    				struct sg_table *sgtable,
				enum dma_data_direction dir);
</pre>
<p>
The parameters must match those used when the buffer was allocated.
<p>
This buffer is not directly accessible by the CPU when returned.  If the
kernel needs a mapping into kernel space, that can be managed with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *dma_vmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
    				 struct sg_table *sgtable);
    void dma_vunmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, void *vaddr);
</pre>
<p>
The existence of a kernel mapping does not make cache-coherency issues go
away, though.  If the kernel may have written to this buffer,
<tt>flush_kernel_vmap_range()</tt> must be called to ensure any cached data
makes it to memory before handing that memory to a device.  Similarly,
<tt>invalidate_kernel_vmap_range()</tt> must be called to remove any cached
data for memory that may have been written by the device.
<p>
Finally, it is possible to map the buffer into user space with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int dma_mmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
			       size_t size, struct sg_table *sgt);
</pre>
<p>
This will normally be done in response to an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
call by the 
application, which can <tt>munmap()</tt> the memory when it's no longer
needed.  Needless to say, if user space accesses this buffer when it is in
the device's hands, the results may be less than optimal.  In cases where
the ownership of the buffer is managed explicitly in user space (such as
with the Video4Linux2 API, for example), access at the wrong time should
not be a problem.
<p>
Also merged in 5.13 was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/20e1dbf2bbe2">a patch to the uvcvideo
driver</a> to switch it from using coherent mappings to the new API.
According to the changelog, this 
change can, on non-cache-coherent systems, improve performance by a factor
of&nbsp;20, which seems worth the effort.  Chances are that other drivers
will make the switch at some point.  It's the kind of change that is not
immediately evident to users, but which makes the system perform much
better in the end.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Correction: The Arm architecture doesn&#x27;t make any specific guarantee not to provide coherent DMA (snoops for inbound memory writes from PCI for example). Most Arm server platforms do provide coherent DMA and indeed we have an ACPI property that informs the kernel of this.<br>

This new API seems quite useful.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve always wondered why IOMMU framework doesn&#x27;t fall back to assembling a large DMA buffer allocation from single pages if it cannot satisfy it from a physically-continuous page range (on arches where this can be done without a significant performance penalty).<br>

In the microcontroler word, it&#x27;s possible with some high end MCU to achieve non contiguous dma transactions without IOMMU. There is a so called MDMA (master DMA) peripheral which is able to process a linked list of memory to memory transactions. MDMA is also connected to standard DMA, so it can chain several memory to peripheral transactions without the need of triggering ISR between each transaction. <br>

A fair number of standard PCI/etc devices are capable of scatter gather operations as well. That tends to be the default for some classes of (storage for example) adapters. Managing those page lists though traditionally could become a bit unwieldy, that is part of what this patch set aims to solve (AFAIK). Of course keeping the buffers continuous has a number of perf advantages as well which again has been part of the recent work.<br>

<h1>Magic groups in 2.6</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 11, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/84229/">2.6.6-mm1 tree</a> includes,
among many other things, patches which add two new <tt>/proc/sys</tt>
variables.  They are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>/proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group</tt></dt>
<dd>If this value is non-zero, it is interpreted as a group ID which gives
access to the the "huge pages" feature of the 2.6 VM.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>/proc/sys/vm/mlock_group</tt></dt>
<dd>
This variable behaves similarly, but it controls access to the
<tt>mlock()</tt> system call (which locks memory into physical RAM)
instead.
</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
The current Linux kernel will not allow a process to perform either of the
above actions unless that process has the <tt>CAP_IPC_LOCK</tt> capability;
in practice, this means that the process needs to run as root.  The main
user of huge pages would appear to be a small program called "Oracle,"
which is something that many users would rather not run with root
privileges.  The new sysctl variables allow an administrator to give the
ability to use huge pages (and <tt>mlock()</tt>) to a specific group; if
Oracle runs within that group, it will be able to do what it needs without
higher privileges.
<p>

These patches are not universally popular; the addition of "magic groups"
with special meaning inside the kernel strikes many developers as an
inelegant, un-Unix-like solution to the problem.  So these developers were
not happy when the <tt>hugetlb_vm_group</tt> patch was merged for 2.6.7
shortly after appearing in the -mm tree.  Rather than rush an ugly hack
into the kernel (which will then have to be supported indefinitely into the
future), they argue, it would have been better to come up with a proper
solution. 
<p>

The problem, it seems, is that there are no better solutions on the
horizon.  <a href="/Articles/84571/">Says Andrew Morton</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Capabilities are broken and don't work.  Nobody has a clue how to
	provide the required services with SELinux and nobody has any code
	and we need the feature *now* before vendors go shipping even more
	ghastly stuff.
</div>
<p>
The problems with capabilities were covered here <a
href="/Articles/79185/">back in April</a>, when this issue last came up.
SELinux can, in principle, solve this problem, but there is the little
disadvantage that nobody has been able to put together a production-ready, working
distribution with SELinux yet.  The distributors have been creating their
own patches to enable Oracle to use the huge pages feature, and many of
those are seen as being worse than the "magic groups" approach.  Rather
than see each distribution take the kernel in a different direction, Andrew
<a href="/Articles/84573/">merged the magic groups patch</a> as the least
evil alternative:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Nasty workarounds will be shipped to end users by vendors.  That's
	a certainty.  We cannot change this now.  What I wish to do is to
	ensure that all users receive the *same* nasty workaround.  Call it
	damage control.
</div>
<p>
To some, however, the control appears worse than the damage.  If vendors add their
own hacks, they take responsibility for maintaining those hacks, or for
weaning users off of them at some future time.  Pulling features out of the
mainline kernel is harder.  Be that as it may, for lack of a better
short-term solution the "magic groups" patch is now part of 2.6.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Why can't these features just be done via devices or special filesystems? <p>Ie the syscalls would take a file descriptor to a device or file, and if that checks out, allow access. <p>Eventually, the explosion of syscalls could be abated, and all these features accessed and permissioned through the filesystem, by just reading and writing from an fd. eg any big page mapping thing could just end up creating files which can then be mmaped. <p>Then only glibc needs to provide wrappers to these functions, and we can return to a small unix api, and a rich filesystem...the ideal behind plan9. <p>

      Because that would be very slow.  Every syscall would require a path lookup which then requires multiple access checks.  Even SELinux has been shown to have a rather noticable speed impact.  If you're running a low-volume or high-security system, then speed doesn't matter.  But for most web servers, desktops, and so on, speed is very very important.

      No, it wouldn't be. <p>On open, you get a file descriptor. <br>This is when all the access checks take place.<br>Everything that you want to do with that permission, you <br>do using the file descriptor. Hopefully via read, write, and mmap - normal system calls. <p>File descriptors are capabilities - not manky POSIX ones, but real ones ( with some added state about file position tacked on). <br>You can pass them around in order to give people access to stuff. <br>They are fast, because if you have the file descriptor, you have the permission. No extra checking required.

      In order to open a file descriptor, you have to access the device node.  This results already in a system call just to do this.  You have to locate and read each component of the device path.  So if you have even just a basic /dev/syscall file descriptor, that's three accesses including lookup (including querying the hard-disk if it's not in a file cache) for /, then /dev, and then finally /dev/syscall.  So that's several syscalls, possible hard-drive access, and several access checks just to invoke a single other syscall.<p>Yuck.

      When you wish to *obtain* access to a new bit of functionality, you go and  <br>open a file descriptior to whatever path - this is a ONE OFF cost. And it  <br>is certainly cheaper than the other one off costs that almost all  <br>processes incur - notably, mapping all their libraries.   <br>  <br>After that, any calls to the functionality will be ONE syscall, which just  <br>has to check that the fd number you passed is in the set of fds that your  <br>process has open, and then follow a pointer to get to the file operations  <br>structure. Do you have a solution that allows you to access privileged  <br>functionality without syscalls? If so, I have a bridge I would like to  <br>sell you. Or do you believe that permissions are rechecked every time a <br>file desciptor is used? They are not. That is the whole damn point of <br>them.  <br> <br>eg:  <br>big_map_cap = open(&quot;/dev/caps/big_map&quot;); <br>//one off cost of a syscall <br> <br>foreach(big_map_that_i_want){ <br>	address = do_me_a_big_map_syscall(big_map_cap, size); <br>	// oh my god, it is a syscall! <br>} <br> <br> <br>So in fact, this is far cheaper than all these ridiculous system call  <br>checkers than context switch to user space to a policy agent if the <br>decision isn't cached or has been thrown away.   <br> <br>

      One approach to implementing multiple facilities on the same host system with incompatible security requirements each requiring fine-grained control possibly by different administrators is to implement otherwise incompatible facilities using virtual machines (e.g. user-mode Linux). As this approach becomes more widespread, will the need to make the host kernel be all things to all users (from a security perspective) at the same time decrease ?

      I just wanted to remind people that the world "capabilities" originally meant something else, and the people who named POSIX capabilities have caused unfortunate confusion.  To see the differences between POSIX capabilities and traditional capabilities, please see Figure 15 in this page:

<a href="http://zesty.ca/capmyths/"> Capability Myths Demolished </a>

Some proponents of traditional capabilities have recently started calling traditional capabilities "object capabilities" in order to reduce the confusion, even though "object capabilities" are identical to the original concept of capabilities published by Dennis and Van Horn in 1965.

      <p>I just wanted to remind people that the world "capabilities" originally meant something else, and the people who named POSIX capabilities have caused unfortunate confusion.  To see the differences between POSIX capabilities and traditional capabilities, please see Figure 15 in this page:
<p><a href="http://zesty.ca/capmyths/"> Capability Myths Demolished </a>
<p>Some proponents of traditional capabilities have recently started calling traditional capabilities "object capabilities" in order to reduce the confusion, even though "object capabilities" are identical to the original concept of capabilities published by Dennis and Van Horn in 1965.
<p>Perhaps it would be good to refer to POSIX capabilities as "POSIX capabilities" instead of "capabilities" in order to help reduce confusion.
<p>Regards,
<p>Zooko

      Also, its important to note that the closest things we have to<br>capabilies on a kernel level are file descriptors - and we should be making use of these rather than totally subverting the unix security model ( SELinux, POSIX ACLS/CAPS, etc). <p>We should also be careful to separate the concept of a physical user from a unix uid. Users should have the ability to create subservient users and groups - that are bounded by the permission set that their 'principal' user has. <p>Every program that is run should really be run under a temporary UID with a minimal per-process namespace as well - ie only knowledge of the files it needs. This includes running dodgy email attachments - if we remove the ambient authority to open random network ports and trash a users files, to fork or malloc the system to death and to do all kinds of other damage, we could run even random binaries and shell scripts emailed to us without fear. <p>This all would all require quite a lot of work, but it wouldn't mean having two or more utterly arbitrary security models tacked on to the unix one. SELinux really makes me sick.

Oh man, I wish someone had done this.  Now that we have SELinux et al, it's not likely to happen.

      I could use more than a reminder, because I never knew the difference.  The referenced figure and surrounding paper also assume I already know the difference but just don't appreciate its significance, so they didn't help me.
<p>
It's not worth an hour of reading to me, but can someone briefly describe the difference?

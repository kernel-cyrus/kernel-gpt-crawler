<h1>The status of object-based reverse mapping</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 19, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The discussion has been quiet in recent times, but work on replacing the
low-level reverse-mapping virtual memory code in the 2.6 kernel continues.
When we last 
looked at the new, object-based reverse mapping ("objrmap") approach, there
were two competing implementations:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Andrea Arcangeli's <a href="/Articles/75198/">anon-vma</a>, which adds
     a data structure creating a connection between each physical page and
     the virtual memory area (VMA) structures which reference it.
<p>
<li> Hugh Dickins's <a href="/Articles/77106/">anonmm</a>, which associates 
     pages with the top-level memory management ("mm") structure instead.
</ul>
<p>
The two approaches are conceptually similar, but each has its strong and
weak points.  Their performance is essentially equivalent.  Thus far, there
has not been any sort of spirited debate over which should be included;
most kernel developers, if they have a preference, have kept it to
themselves.
<p>
Hugh has been busy over the last few weeks, however, creating a series of
40 patches aimed at slowly moving the reverse mapping code over to the
object-based approach.  The first five of those patches, which are
restricted to cleanup and preparatory work, have been merged into the 2.6
mainline.  "rmap-10" added anonmm; it was promptly merged into the -mm
tree.  This action did not imply that anonmm had been chosen over anon-vma,
however; it was simply the first step in the testing process which would
lead to a final decision.
<p>
Hugh's final series of patches (rmap-34 to rmap-40) completes the process
by replacing anonmm with anon-vma; these patches are present in 2.6.6-mm4.
Hugh <a href="/Articles/85715/">introduces</a> the patch set by saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Judge for yourselves which you prefer.  I do think I was wrong to
	call anon_vma more complex than anonmm (its lists are easier to
	understand than my refcounting), and I'm happy with its vma merging
	after the last patch.  It just comes down to whether we can spare
	the extra 24 bytes (maximum, on 32-bit) per vma for its advantages
	in swapout and mremap.
</div>
<p>
As Hugh notes, anon-vma should have better swapping performance, since its
structures make it easier to find the VMA for a given page.  Additionally,
the anonmm code works best when shared anonymous pages have the same
virtual address in each address space that uses them; if a process moves
pages with <tt>mremap()</tt>, some relatively complicated work must be
performed to make things work.  The anon-vma solution does not have that
particular problem.
<p>
On the other hand, expanding the VMA
structure is not something which should be done lightly; some loads can use
huge numbers of VMAs, and they must all be located in low memory.  That
said, either reverse mapping scheme should free far more low memory than it
consumes; that is, after all, one of the main points behind this entire
exercise. 
<p>
There still has been no public word on which scheme will be chosen, or when
it might be merged.  The current state of affairs suggests, however, that
anon-vma will be the one that goes in unless some sort of major problem
turns up.  As for timing: enough major work has already gone into 2.6.7
that it's hard to imagine throwing major VM surgery into the mix.  So 2.6.8
is the earliest such a merge could possibly happen.  A couple of 2.6
releases after that, the forking of the 2.7 tree might just become a
possibility.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'd be pretty shocked if a new VM went into mainline without being in -mm <br>for a while first, if for no other reason than to make sure that people <br>with different sorts of systems actually test the one that ends up going <br>in.

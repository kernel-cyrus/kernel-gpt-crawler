<h1>A pair of suspend2 patches</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
One of the outcomes from the power management summit held on July&nbsp;17
was a decision to move toward merging Nigel Cunningham's suspend2 patches -
at least, those which appear to make sense to the wider community.
Suspend2 is an out-of-tree implementation of the suspend-to-disk and
suspend-to-ram features which are so nice to have on laptop systems.  The
suspend2 implementation offers a number of features not found in the
mainline version, including nice displays, progress bars, interruptible
operation, and, it is said, greater reliability.  Getting the better parts
of suspend2 into the mainline seems like a clearly desirable goal.  Since
the summit, Nigel has posted a pair of patches which provide some clues as
to what is coming, and how it will be received.
<p>

A big part of the software suspend problem is getting the system into a
quiescent state before putting it on ice.  To that end, processes are put
into the "refrigerator," a special sort of suspended animation.  When
suspend time comes around, every process on the system is sent a special
signal telling it that refrigeration time has come; each process, once it
gets to a good stopping point, checks itself into the fridge and does not
run again until after the system has been resumed.
<p>

The problem that this scheme runs into is that some processes are dependent
on others.  If a process which, for example, is involved with getting data
written to disk is refrigerated too early in the process, it may never be
possible to get the system to a state where it can be suspended.  So the
software suspend patches try to figure out which processes must be allowed
to continue running while the system is being quiesced.  It has always been
a bit of a hit-and-miss business.  The current suspend2 patches try to
clean up that process a bit.
<p>

Many of the processes which should not be refrigerated are associated with
various driver workqueues.  So the mainline suspend code marks every
workqueue process with the special <tt>PF_NOFREEZE</tt> flag, keeping it
out of the clutches of the refrigerator.  But most of those processes can
be refrigerated just fine with no ill effect, and they should be.  Having
unneeded processes running when the system is trying to suspend itself can
only serve to destabilize the entire situation.
<p>

Previous versions of the suspend2 patches changed the workqueue API so that
every creator of a workqueue had to explicitly state whether it should be
refrigerated or not.  That approach worked, but it broke every
<tt>create_workqueue()</tt> call.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/144504/">current patch</a>, instead, leaves
the existing calls alone, but extends the API with a couple of new calls:
<p>
<pre>
    struct workqueue_struct *create_nofreeze_workqueue(const char *name);
    struct workqueue_struct *create_nofreeze_singlethread_workqueue(const char *name);
</pre>
<p>
As an aside, one notes that kernel namespace is starting to acquire some
very long function names.  One might almost wish for the good old days,
when only the first six characters of a function name were used.
<p>
Seriously, however, these functions show how refrigeration is now handled
with workqueues.  By default, worker tasks associated with workqueues will
be put on ice when the system is suspended.  Anybody wishing to create a
workqueue which does <i>not</i> behave that way must call one of the new
functions. 
<p>
This change has been propagated down to the generic kernel threads
layer, which also picked up a new function:
<p>
<pre>
    struct task_struct *kthread_nofreeze_create(int (fn)(void *data),
                                                void *data,
						const char *namefmt, ...);
</pre>
<p>
This patch seems likely to be merged with, at most, minor tweaks.  Nigel's
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/144502/">second patch</a>, however, got a
somewhat less friendly reception.
It creates a new process flag called <tt>PF_SYNCTHREAD</tt>.
Any process which is actively trying to flush data to disk is marked with
this flag; the end result is that it will be passed over by the
refrigerator during the early part of the suspend process.  In this way,
processes which are creating dirty pages can be put on hold prior to those which
are trying to clean those pages up.  This patch is not popular, however; it
has been criticized for being overly intrusive when simply flushing all
pages to disk prior to beginning the suspend process would do the trick.
So, unless things change, this patch will not go in.
<p>

In any case, these patches are just preparatory work for a larger event:
the merging of a new refrigerator implementation.  That code has not
(recently) been posted; stay tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Whenever I see a suspend2 article, I have to say *something* because I think it's great.<br>
<p>
I have been using suspend2 for quite a while, now.  It works much better in the 2.6 kernel than in the 2.4.<br>
<p>
Yes, it is very useful, almost essential, for laptops, and I have it installed on my Linux laptop.  However, I use it most often with my desktop system.  Before suspend existed, I'd leave my system on all the time because I didn't want to lose all my existing state.  Now, I just hibernate, and I save *all* my desktop (and obviously machine) state, and AC power as well.<br>
<p>
Linux does a fantastic job with servers, and I would never speak against the need for server functionality.  But if we want it to really succeed on the desktop, I believe we absolutely *require* good, reliable hibernation functionality.<br>
<p>
Anyway, just my 2 cents.<br>

      "...simply flushing all pages to disk prior to beginning the suspend process would do the trick..."<br>
<p>
Hi. This is precisely the point I've trying to make: Flushing all pages to disk prior to beginning the suspend process wouldn't do the trick. It is entirely possible that other processes will submit I/O while or after the flush runs. In addition, if other processes are submitting I/O while the sync is running, the sync may not return until after the other processes have submitted an awfully large amount of I/O (depending on patterns). I've been told that work is in progress to address this, but it still leaves the first problem.<br>
<p>
The only way to address the race is to remove the race: stop processes submitting new I/O, sync the I/O that is there and then get on with suspending.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Nigel<br>

      That's probably the dumbest question ever heard, but...     
<br>Why is it needed to flush dirty pages? Presumably, all pages are in    
the memory, which is going to be saved to disk anyway...   
<br>Why is it not possible to   
<ul>   
<li>stop all processes   
<li>tell all drivers to suspend (apart from hard-disk, of course)   
<li>copy memory contents and registers to disk  
<li>suspend system   
</ul>   
<br>Is there some document I could read about that so I'll ask more clever 
questions in the future?

      I think the reason would be:<br>
<p>
Dirty pages can also be pages from the file system. Not flushing them would put the FS in an inconsistent state - i.e. the changes are not written. This would not be a problem IF the machine was brought up again from the hibernated state, but if that fails then you have a damaged file system..<br>

      Long function names like this usually indicate a flags parameter could be useful:<br>
<p>
    create_workqueue(NOFREEZE | SINGLETHREAD);<br>
<p>
This tends to make the API more future-friendly too.  Other than performance (which isn't too critical when creating workqueues), is there any reason to create 2^N function calls instead of N flags?<br>

      Sorry for the long delay in replying :)<br>
<p>
I agree, but the consensus from others was that they view it as more important to minimise the changes to the api. Adding a _nofreeze variant lets us only change the functions that need to be unfreezable.<br>

<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
It would have been surprising indeed if the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM) did not include a
session working toward solutions to the longstanding problems with
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, an internal function that locks user-space pages
in memory for access by the kernel.  The issue has, after all, <a
href="/Articles/753027/">come</a> <a href="/Articles/784574/">up</a> <a
href="/Articles/807108/">numerous</a> <a href="/Articles/849638/">times</a>
over the years.  This year's event duly contained a session in the joint
filesystem and memory-management track, led by John Hubbard, with a focus
on page pinning and how it interacts with filesystems.
<p>
File-backed pages, naturally, have a filesystem behind them that manages
the movement of data to and from persistent storage.
The root of the problem with page pinning is that the kernel uses it to
operate on the contents of pages outside of the filesystem's purview; that
can lead to unpleasant surprises when those contents change at times when the
filesystem is not expecting it.  If filesystems were aware of pinned pages
then they could at least attempt to take evasive action, but pinning is
generally invisible to filesystems.
<p>
The approach that has been taken is to try to make pinning explicit and
visible; to that end, the new <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/pin_user_pages.html?highlight=page_maybe_dma_pinned"><tt>pin_user_pages()</tt>
API</a> was added.  The effect is about the same as with
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, but this interface attempts to mark pages to
show that they have been pinned.
There is still one little problem, though: there are no
spare bits in <tt>struct page</tt> to track the <i>number</i> of times a given
page has been pinned, so the developers had to hack things by using
a bias value (1024) in the page reference count.  As a result, if a
page has at least that many references, it will appear to be pinned even if

<a href="/Articles/894394/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/JohnHubbard-sm.png"
alt="[John Hubbard]" title="John Hubbard" class="rthumb"></a>

it is not.  For that reason, the function to query whether a page is
pinned is called <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/pin_user_pages.html?highlight=page_maybe_dma_pinned#page-maybe-dma-pinned-the-whole-point-of-pinning"><tt>page_maybe_dma_pinned()</tt></a>.
Hubbard complained about the "maybe" in the name; it seems inadequate, but
it is the best that the development community has been able to achieve so
far.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox said that the <a href="/Articles/893512/">folio work</a>
might be able to provide a few extra bits for a pin counter, but it is
probably not enough.  There was some talk of putting this count into a side
structure, moving it out of <tt>struct page</tt> entirely.  David
Howells noted that the sorts of accesses that pin pages (DMA and direct
I/O, primarily) are not that common, so the side-structure idea might be
the best approach.  David Hildenbrand wasn't sure of the scope of the
problem, since the bias is 1024, it takes a lot of references for a page to
appear to be pinned.  Wilcox pointed out that frequently mapped pages, such
as those containing the C&nbsp;library, will have high reference counts.
<p>
Hubbard returned to the status of the pinning work, saying that developers
need to think about why they need access to the pages in question.  If they
are doing something that will touch a page's contents, then
<tt>pin_user_pages()</tt> should be used.  In other cases, often where the
intent is to make changes to the underlying <tt>page</tt> structures,
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> is the right function to call.  The process of
converting filesystems to deal with pinning is ongoing; it is not a small
job.  There are also a lot of cases where 
kernel code uses <tt>set_page_dirty()</tt> to mark a page as having
been modified, then unpins the page.  He made a helper for that case,
but it feels wrong to him; each one is a place where pages are being marked
"dirty" outside of the filesystem that is responsible for them, but which
is still not actively involved in (or aware of) the operation.  At least
the evil is concentrated now, he said.
<p>
At this point, Hubbard noted that he had 12 minutes left in his session to
come up with a finished design that fully solves the pinning problem.  Even
after everything has been converted to the new pinning API, he said, the
problems that drove all this work in the first place will remain unfixed.  His
suggestion was to add an API allowing kernel 
code to take a lease on a range within a file, and to require leases to be
taken before pinning file pages.  There is a significant advantage to this
approach: it is a correct solution that would connect the filesystem and
memory-management code.  There has to be some way of communicating
information about changes to file-backed code to filesystems, and this is
the only proposal he has seen so far.
<p>
Ira Weiny objected that leases are hard to get right; there are lots of
roadblocks that come up.  He agreed, though, that some way of making
filesystems aware of pins is needed.  But filesystems, he said, don't like
letting go of pages they are responsible for.  Ext4 maintainer Ted Ts'o
answered, though, that the prospect doesn't worry him.  A lease (or
equivalent mechanism) would be telling the filesystem that the pages in the
affected range may be marked dirty at some point in the future; that
implies that if the indicated pages don't have blocks allocated in the
filesystem, that must be rectified immediately.  A copy-on-write filesystem
might have to copy the whole range, even if the pages are never dirtied in
the end.  If the pages <i>are</i> dirtied all of this is fine, and perhaps
even better, since allocating for the whole range at once might lead to
better layout.
<p>
Howells said that he did an implementation of file leases for network
filesystems, but he ended up abandoning it.  There were just too many
problems with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/truncate.2.html"><tt>truncate()</tt></a>,
and with direct I/O; it is hard to get it right.  Hubbard suggested just
ignoring <tt>truncate()</tt>, to general laughter.
<p>
Chris Mason said that, for Btrfs, marking the page dirty is not the only
problem.  Btrfs has to lock pages before doing I/O so that their contents
can't change; among other things, a checksum of the page's contents must be
taken, and that checksum must continue to match those contents.  Josef
Bacik said, in his classic way, that the situation was bad in 
general, and that this problem is the biggest barrier to the sharing of
pages in the page cache.  The memory-management subsystem going behind a
filesystem's back is a huge problem, he said, that has to be fixed.  He is
not thrilled with the lease idea, though; it would conflict with the way
that Btrfs manages ranges of dirty pages.
<p>
Kent Overstreet answered, though, that user space has always been able to
modify pages at inopportune times.  Direct I/O, for example, bypasses the
page cache, and a buffer used for direct I/O can be mapped into a file as
well.  This can actually lead to deadlocks in some situations, and could be
an attack vector.  Bacik said that Btrfs has a special path for just this
case.
<p>
Hubbard, having not really gotten the 12-minute design he was after, closed
the session by noting that fixing these problems may cause performance
regressions.  There may be objections but, he said, the higher performance
was an "illusion" and the system was not correct.  There was some brief
discussion of ways to mitigate some of any future performance loss, but
developers may still find themselves having to explain to users why their
I/O should not have been as fast as it was before the system was made to
work correctly.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Page pinning means that a page cannot be unloaded, but it also means that the page cannot be moved to a different location in physical memory. The kernel might want to move a page if it&#x27;s trying to allocate a physically contiguous region of memory, for example for hugepages. If there are false positives (pages that appear to be pinned but aren&#x27;t) then the kernel will have a hard time allocating this memory.<br>

Virtualization remains an area of high interest in the development
community.  The "paravirtualization" mode, as epitomized by the Xen
project, is still getting the lion's share of the attention.  With
paravirtualization, an 
i386-like architecture is defined, and the kernel is ported to that
architecture.  Virtualized systems are then run on that architecture with a
hypervisor standing by to handle privileged requests.
<p>
An increasing part of the mind share is being taken by "lightweight
virtualization" or "container" approaches, however.  With containers,
virtualized systems run directly on the host kernel, contained within
various walls which give those systems the appearance of having the computer to
themselves.  Containers have the advantage of being much cheaper; far more
containerized systems than paravirtualized systems can be run on the same
host. 
<p>
<h3>Paravirtualization</h3>
<p>
The Kernel Summit featured two sessions devoted to these topics, with
paravirtualization coming first.  Xen hacker Keir Fraser started out with a
discussion of Xen, which, he says, is the only free paravirtualization
solution out there.  Work on getting the Xen patches ready for merging
continues, with a new patch set having been posted on the day this session
was held.  The bulk of these patches define the new architecture type,
while a smaller subset is dedicated to providing I/O services to
paravirtualized systems.
<p>
The biggest sticking point came up early in the discussion.  Despite the
claim that Xen is the only free system out there, the kernel developers
(and certain proprietary virtualization vendors) have a strong interest in
supporting more than one paravirtualization solution.  It would be nice to
have only one set of virtualization hooks in the client-side kernel, and it
would be nice if that kernel could run, unmodified, under more than just
one type of hypervisor.
<p>
One solution to this problem is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/175706/">VMI interface</a> proposed by the 
folks at VMWare; Zachary Amsden was there to promote this approach.
VMI abstracts out the system-specific operations, 
allowing them to be filled in at run time.  The way these operations are
filled in, however, is not particularly popular: it involves injecting a
binary "hypervisor ROM" into the client system.  The kernel developers are
not enthusiastic about adding hooks for the addition of binary
code, so this idea has met resistance.
<p>
The alternative is to use some sort of impedance-matching layer which is
loaded like a shared library.  Rusty Russell has a proposal called
"paravirt_ops" which takes this approach; it involves no binary code
blobs.  The consensus at the meeting seemed to be that this approach was
the right way forward, so that is how things are likely to go.  The only
question seems to be whether Xen should be merged first, then evolved
toward paravirt_ops, or not; there was little enthusiasm, however, for
merging an approach which is destined to be ripped out before being shipped
to anybody.
<p>
The problem remains, however, that nailing down the paravirtualization API
will be a bit of a challenge.  It is early in the game, and there are still
a number of lessons yet to be learned in this area.  So, while something
may well find its way into the kernel before too long, it should be
expected to be fluid for a while.  There doesn't seem to be much of a sense
of urgency, however, in nailing things down; the target time frame appears
to be a year or so from now, when Novell and Red Hat will be pulling
together their next-generation enterprise distributions.  As long as things
are in shape by then, most of the people involved should be happy.
<p>
<h3>Containers</h3>
<p>
The containers session was less contentious; the (numerous) players
involved seem determined to work together, so it's mostly a matter of
finding the best solutions to the problems.  Those problems are, in
essence, finding the best way to turn a large number of global namespaces
into private namespaces which can be different from one container to the
next.  There is a large number of these namespaces, including the
filesystem hierarchy, process IDs, resource limits, network interfaces, and
more.  Patches for many of these have been circulated (and covered on LWN);
it's mostly a matter of getting them into good shape and convincing the
rest of the world that they are worth merging.

<p>
One open question is whether the kernel needs an explicit container
concept which would pull together all those private namespaces.  Adding
that type might make it easier to stay on top of a heavily containerized
system, but it might also make it harder to provide fine-grained control
over which namespaces are shared and which are not.
<p>

A big problem is finding a solution for <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt>.
These virtual filesystems are global namespaces with no concept of multiple
views.  Filtering invisible processes out of <tt>/proc</tt> would be
relatively easy, but the other files there (including everything in
<tt>/proc/sys</tt>) are harder.  Providing separate versions of these
filesystems looks, in general, to be a painful task.
<p>
It was suggested that processes within containers might simply not see the
bulk of <tt>/proc</tt> at all.  That might require changes in a few system
applications, but, when the developers were asked if they thought whether
requiring modified distributions to run within containers was a problem,
nobody spoke up. It was even suggested that <tt>/proc</tt>-free containers
could be the path by which much old <tt>/proc</tt> cruft is cleaned up for
the world as a whole.
<p>
Finally, there was some concern that containers might prove to be a useful
tool for rootkit writers.  With a bit of effort, a rootkit could put
everybody within a container and, thus, easily hide itself.  How this
problem will be solved is not entirely clear; one part of the solution may
be providing an unambiguous way for a process to determine whether it is
running within a container or not.

      I understand the reluctance of the kernel folks to support binary blobs, but the VMI interface is well defined and has many uses with opensouce binary blobs (the examples that were given about things to allow incompatable versions of xen clients and servers should have been opensource, and the one that allows a client-compiled kernel to run on bare hardware should be a trivial opensource one) so I hope they aren't throwing out a useful tool just becouse it can be abused.<br>
<p>
this seems very similar to the new high-performance syscalls in design, just adapted for the kernel to use to run privilaged commands, and with a tightly specified interface so that it will remain the same across systems (and this isn't just a closed-source thing. different releases of linux kernels have very different internal API's, it's really nice to be able to have different versions of clients on one host, specificly including old versions running on a newer host)<br>

      <blockquote>Finally, there was some concern that containers might prove to be a useful tool for rootkit writers. With a bit of effort, a rootkit could put everybody within a container and, thus, easily hide itself.</blockquote>

Note that apparently the hardware support for virtualization brings the threat of a
<a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2006/06/introducing-blue-pill.html"> hypervisor-based rootkit</a> without the OS even supporting any kind of virtualization itself.

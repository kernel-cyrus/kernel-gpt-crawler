In the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">first article</a> in
this series about unioning file systems, I reviewed the terminology
and major design issues of unioning file systems.  In
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">second article</a>, I
described three implementations of union mounts: Plan 9, BSD, and
Linux.  In this article, I will examine two unioning file systems for
Linux: unionfs and aufs.
<p>

While union mounts and union file systems have the same goals, they
are fundamentally different "under the hood."  Union mounts are a
first class operating systems object, implemented right smack in the
middle of the VFS code; they usually require some minor modifications to
the underlying file systems.  Union file systems, instead, are implemented in
the space between the VFS and the underlying file system, with few or
no changes outside the union file system code itself.  With a union
file system, the VFS thinks it's talking a regular file system, and
the file system thinks it's talking to the VFS, but in reality both
are actually talking to the union file system code.  As we'll see,
each approach has advantages and disadvantages.
<p>

<h3>Unionfs</h3>

Unionfs is the best-known and longest-lived implementation of a
unioning file system for Linux.  Unionfs development began at SUNY
Stony Brook in 2003, as part of
the <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/">FiST</a> stackable file
system project.  Both projects are led
by <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~ezk/">Erez Zadok</a>, a
professor at Stony Brook as well as an active contributor to the Linux
kernel.  Many developers have contributed to unionfs over the years;
for a complete list, see the list of past students on
the <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html">unionfs</a>
web page - or read the copyright notices in the unionfs source code.
<p>

Unionfs comes in two major versions, version&nbsp;1.x and version&nbsp;2.x.
Version&nbsp;1 was the original implementation, started in 2003.  Version&nbsp;2
is a rewrite intended to fix some of the problems with version&nbsp;1; it
is the version&nbsp;under active development.  A design document for
version&nbsp;2 is available
at <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/unionfs-odf.txt">http://www.filesystems.org/unionfs-odf.txt</a>.
Not all the features described in this document are implemented (at
least not in the
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ezk/unionfs.git;a=summary">publicly
available git tree</a>); for example, whiteouts are still stored as
directory entries with special names, which pollutes the namespace and
makes stacking of a unionfs file system over another unionfs file
system impossible.
<p>

<h4>Unionfs basic architecture</h4>

The unionfs code is a shim between the VFS and underlying file systems
(the branches).  Unionfs registers itself as a file system with the
VFS and communicates with it using the standard VFS-file system
interface.  Unionfs supplies various file system operation sets (such
as super block operations, which specify how to setup the file system
at mount, allocate new inodes, sync out changes to disk, and tear down
its data structures on unmount).  At the data structure level, unionfs
file systems have their own superblock, mount, inode, dentry, and file
structures that link to those of the underlying file systems.  Each
unionfs file system object includes an array of pointers to the
related objects from the underlying branches.  For example, the
unionfs dentry private data (kept in the <code>d_fsdata</code> looks
like:

<pre>
    /* unionfs dentry data in memory */
    struct unionfs_dentry_info {
            /*
             * The semaphore is used to lock the dentry as soon as we get into a
             * unionfs function from the VFS.  Our lock ordering is that children
             * go before their parents.
             */
            struct mutex lock;
            int bstart;
            int bend;
            int bopaque;
            int bcount;
            atomic_t generation;
            struct path *lower_paths;
    };
</pre>

The <code>lower_paths</code> member is a pointer to an array of path
structures (which include a pointer to both the dentry and
the <code>mnt</code> structure) for each directory with the same path in
the lower file systems.  For example, if you had three branches, and
two of the branches had a directory named "<code>/foo/bar/</code>",
then, on lookup of that directory, unionfs will allocate (1)&nbsp;a
<code>dentry</code> structure, (2)&nbsp;a <code>unionfs_dentry_info</code>
structure with a three-member <code>lower_paths</code> array, and (3)&nbsp;two
<code>dentry</code> structures for the directories.  Two members of 
the <code>lower_paths</code> array will be filled with pointers to
these dentries and their respective <code>mnt</code> structures.  The
array itself is dynamically allocated, grown, and shrunk according to
the number of branches.  The number of branches (and therefore the
size of the array) is limited by a compile-time
constant, <code>UNIONFS_MAX_BRANCHES</code>, which defaults to 128 -
about 126 more than commonly necessary, and more than enough for every
reasonable application of union file systems.  The rest of the unionfs
data structures - super blocks, dentries, etc. - look very similar to
the structure described above.
<p>

The VFS calls the unionfs inode, dentry, etc. routines directly, which
then call back into the VFS to perform operations on the corresponding
data structures of the lower level branches.  Take the example of
writing to a file: the VFS calls the <code>write()</code> function in
the inode's file operations vector.  The inode is a unionfs inode, so
it calls <code>unionfs_write()</code>, which
finds the lower-level inode and checks whether it is hosted on a
read-only branch. (Unionfs copies up a file on the first write to the
data or metadata, not on the first <code>open()</code> with write
permission.)  If the file is hosted on a read-only branch, unionfs
finds a writable branch and creates a new file on that branch (and any
directories in the path that don't already exist on the selected
branch).  It then copies up the various associated attributes - file
modification and access times, owner, mode, extended attributes,
etc. - and the file data itself.  Finally, it calls the
low-level <code>write()</code> file operation from the newly allocated
inode and returns the result back to the VFS.
<p>

Unionfs supports multiple writable branches.  A file deletion (unlink) operation
is propagated through all writable branches, deleting (decrementing
the link count) of all files with the same pathname.  If unionfs
encounters a read-only branch, it creates a whiteout entry in the
branch above it.  Whiteout entries are named
"<code>.wh.&lt;filename&gt;</code>", a directory is marked opaque with
an entry named "<code>.wh.__dir_opaque</code>".
<p>

Unionfs provides some level of cache-coherency by revalidating
dentries before operating on them.  This works reasonably well as long
as all accesses to the underlying file systems goes through the
unionfs mount.  Direct changes to the underlying file systems are
possible, but unionfs cannot correctly handle this in all cases,
especially when the directory structure changes.
<p>

Unionfs is under active development.  According
the <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/unionfs-odf.txt">version 2
    design document</a>, whiteouts will be moved to small external
file system.  A inode remapping file in the external file system will
allow persistent, stable inode numbers to be returned, making NFS
exports of unionfs file systems behave correctly.
<p>

The status of unionfs as a candidate for merging into the mainline
Linux kernel is mixed.  On the one hand, Andrew Morton merged unionfs
into the -mm tree in January 2007, on the theory that unionfs may not
be the ideal solution, but it is one solution to a real problem.
Merging it into -mm may also prompt developers who don't like the
design to work on other unioning designs.  However, unionfs has strong
NACKs from Al Viro and Christoph Hellwig, among others, and Linus is
reluctant to overrule subsystem maintainers.
<p>

The main objections to unionfs include its heavy duplication of data
structures such as inodes, the difficulty of propagating operations
from one branch to another, a few apparently insoluble race
conditions, and the overall code size and complexity.  These
objections also apply to a greater or lesser degree to other stackable
file systems, such as ecryptfs.  The consensus at the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">2009 Linux file 
systems workshop</a> was that stackable file systems are conceptually
elegant, but difficult or impossible to implement in a maintainable
manner with the current VFS structure.  My own experience writing a
stacked file system (an in-kernel chunkfs prototype) leads me to agree
with these criticisms.
<p>

Stackable file systems may be on the way out.  Dustin Kirkland
proposed a new design for encrypted file systems that would not be
based on stackable file systems.  Instead, it would create generic
library functions in the VFS to provide features that would also be
useful for other file systems.  We identified several specific
instances where code could be shared between btrfs, NFS, and the
proposed ecryptfs design.  Clearly, if stackable file systems are no longer
a part of Linux, the future of a unioning file system built on stacking is
in doubt.
<p>

<h3>aufs</h3>

Aufs, short for "Another UnionFS", was initially implemented as a fork
of the unionfs code, but was rewritten from scratch in 2006.  The lead
developer is Junjiro R. Okajima, with some contributions from other
developers.  The main aufs web site is at
<a href="http://aufs.sourceforge.net/aufs.html">http://aufs.sourceforge.net/</a>.
<p>

The architecture of aufs is very similar to unionfs.  The basic
building block is the array of lower-level file system structures
hanging off of the top-level aufs object.  Whiteouts are named
similarly to those in unionfs, but they are hard links to a single whiteout
inode in the local directory. (When the maximum link count for the
whiteout inode is reached, a new whiteout inode is allocated.)
<p>

Aufs is the most featureful of the unioning file systems.  It supports
multiple writable branch selection policies.  The most useful is
probably the "allocate from branch with the most free space" policy.
Aufs supports stable, persistent inode numbers via an inode
translation table kept on an external file system.  Hard links across
branches work.  In general, if there is more than one way to do it,
aufs not only implements them all but also gives you a run-time
configuration option to select which way you would like to do it.
<p>

Given the incredible flexibility and feature set of aufs, why isn't it
more popular?  A quick browse through the source code gives a clue.
Aufs consists of about 20,000 lines of dense, unreadable, uncommented
code, as opposed to around 10,000 for unionfs and 3,000 for union
mounts and 60,000 for all of the VFS.  The aufs code is generally something
that one does not want to look at.
<p>
The evolution of the aufs source base tends towards increasing
complexity; for example, when removing a directory full of whiteouts
takes an unreasonably long time, the solution is to create a kernel
thread that removes the whiteouts in the background, instead of trying
to find a more efficient way to handle whiteouts.  Aufs slices, dices,
and makes julienne fries, but it does so in ways that are difficult to
maintain and which pollute the namespace.  More is not better in this case;
the general trend is that the fewer the lines of code (and features)
in a unioning file system, the better the feedback from other file
system developers.
<p>

Junjiro Okajima recently submitted a somewhat stripped down version of
aufs for mainline:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    I have another version which dropped many features and the size became
    about half because such suggestion was posted LKML. But I got no
    response for it. Additionally I am afraid it is useless in real world
    since the dropped features are so essential.
</div>
<p>
While aufs is used by a number of practical projects (such as the
Knoppix Live CD), aufs shows no sign of getting closer to being merged
into mainline Linux.
<p>

<h3>The future of unioning file systems development</h3>

Disclaimer: I am actively working on union mounts, so my summary will
be biased in their favor.
<p>

Union file systems have the advantage of keeping most of the unioning
code segregated off into its own corner - modularity is good.  But
it's hard to implement efficient race-free file system operations
without the active cooperation of the VFS.


My personal opinion is that union mounts will be the dominant unioning
file system solution.  Union mounts have always been more popular with
the VFS maintainers, and during the VFS session at the recent file
systems workshop, Jan Blunck and I were able to satisfactorily answer
all of Al Viro's questions about corner cases in union mounts.
<p>

Part of what makes union mounts attractive is that we have focused on
specific use cases and dumped the features that have a low
reward-to-maintenance-cost ratio.  We said "no" to NFS export of unioned
file systems and therefore did not have implement stable inode
numbers.  While NFS export would be nice, it's not a key design
requirement for the top use cases, and implementing it would require a
stackable file system-style double inode structure, with the attendant
complexity of propagating file system operations up and down between
the union mount inode and the underlying file system inode.  We won't
handle online modification of branches other than the topmost writable
branch, or modification of file systems that don't go through the
union mount code, so we don't have to deal with complex
cache-coherency issues.  To enforce this policy, Al Viro suggested a
per-superblock "no, you REALLY can't ever write to this file system"
flag, since currently read/write permissions are on a per-mount basis.
<p>

The <code>st_dev</code> and <code>st_ino</code> fields in stat will
change after a write to a file (technically, an open with write
permission), but most programs use this information, along
with <code>ctime/mtime</code> to decide whether a file has changed -
which is exactly what has just happened, so the application should
behave as expected.  Files from different underlying devices in the
same directory may confuse userland programs that expect to be able to
rename within a directory - e.g., at least some versions of "<code>make
menuconf</code>" barf in this situation.  However, this problem already
exists with bind mounts, which can result in entries with different
backing devices in the same directory.  Rewriting the few programs
that don't handle this correctly is necessary to handle already
existing Linux features.
<p>

Changes to the underlying read-only file system must be done offline -
when it is not mounted as part of the union.  We have at least two
schemes for propagating those changes up to the writable branch, which
may have marked directories opaque that we now want to see through
again.  One is to run a userland program over the writable file system
to mark everything transparent again.  Another is to use the
mtime/ctime information on directories to see if the underlying
directory has changed since we last copied up its entries.  This can
be done incrementally at run-time.
<p>

Overall, the solution with the most buy-in from kernel developers is
union mounts.  If we can solve the <code>readdir()</code> problem -
and we think we can - then it will be on track for merging in a
reasonable time frame.

NFS exporting union mounts is one of my personal top use cases unfortunately. :-)  We use the FUSE based unionfs[1] for doing distro mirroring based on ISO files.<br>
<p>
We loopback mount all the ISO's, then union these filesystems together to "recreate" the appearance of one tree with everything in it, then are able to export all of this via NFS to clients.  We now have the raw .iso files available, each disk individually as well as a merged tree.<br>
<p>
This probably isn't the most typical use case for unioning :-)  It works, but is rather slow as you might imagine... and our /etc/exports file is very ugly indeed!<br>

It would seem that a possible extension of the proposed rule, "no NFS export of unionfs," could be, "no NFS export of unionfs unless all members of the union are RO." If no writes are being performed, the inodes are certainly stable.<br>
<p>
That would solve your use case, where you really just want a union mount to implement logical volumes, not true FS overlay with transparent write-through.<br>

Having 'stable inode numbers' is a little bit confusing here. In general it is true what you are saying but with NFS we also have the problem that we would need unique inode numbers to export them. Since the VFS based union mount implementation doesn't come with their own inodes but directly hands out the underlying filesystems objects this requirement isn't given.<br>

Distros usually create full trees in a different way than the DVD flavors (at least SUSE is doing that). Unioning multiple DVDs together to one tree doesn't work reliable that way. You usually don't have the package metadata for that unified repository. Therefore you would call createrepodata anyway. Therefore it isn't necessary to use union mounts for that in the first place.<br>

In our case we were unioning the various CD's together (not DVD ISO's).  Primarily with RH/Fedora/CentOS (users can point their installers to the union'd tree for installs vis HTTP, NFS, etc).  I also do this with the SLES10 CD ISO's, but it's used much less frequently here although I believe it's been working as well but could be wrong.<br>

There are some things can only be implemented with a unioning file system, like a read-write layer on top of a shared read-only layer.  But there are other things that are more efficiently or easily implemented via the usual mechanisms - normal mount points, bind mounts, and plain ol' cp -r.  It is tempting to view unioning file systems as the Swiss army knife of system management, but that's the kind of feature creep that results in an unmaintainable buggy system.<br>
<p>
Remember the source control use case for original Plan 9 and BSD union mounts - you don't actually want a union mount, you want a full-fledged source control system.<br>

I thought your summary was pretty good:<br>

Clearly, this works since it is what BSD has been doing for years.  But I don't like the idea of caching the entire directory very much.  Dealing with directories with lots of entries is often not ideal, and this will add another constraint on the size of directories.  For small directories, this works fine.  For large directories, suddenly the size of directories is related to the amount of memory you have available.  Imagine not being able to do an ls because you don't have enough memory to process the whiteouts - which you could fix if you could delete some files - but you don't know what the files are named because readdir() fails...<br>
<p>
I'm sure you've thought about this more than I have, though.  Any thoughts?<br>

As you note, memory is a problem with glibc implementation with large directories. Your proposed scheme for readdir looks good, except that I find it a bit restrictive to tie a top layer to a bottom layer. I guess with you scheme, once you do a union mount, you can't re-union the top layer on top of any other layer.<br>

As previously commented on LWN.net, union mounts lack this "separate namespace" thing, so unionfs/aufs do have their place.<br>

<h1>Large block size support</h1>

On its face, it doesn't seem like Christoph Lameter's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/231793/">large block size support patch</a>
would be that controversial.  This patch set equips the page cache to hold
blocks which are larger than the system's page size by storing them in
higher-order, compound pages.  That, in turn, enables filesystems to work
with larger blocks.  The patch should make operations on large files more
efficient and improve the kernel's support for some types of hardware.  The
patch might eventually get merged, but not before more discussion has
happened.
<p>

The problem is that this patch is not without its difficulties.  It adds a
certain amount of complexity to the core virtual memory subsystem to
implement what is, in all reality, a feature which has been rejected
before: larger pages.  The patch currently ducks the most difficult part of
the problem - handling faults on larger pages, needed to make
<tt>mmap()</tt> work - meaning that more complexity can be expected in the
future.  Larger blocks in the page cache means more demand for higher-order
pages, which are already in short supply on many systems; that, in turn,
means that the anti-fragmentation patches would almost certainly be needed
as well.  Use of larger pages in the page cache can also lead to more
internal fragmentation and less efficient memory use.
<p>

For all these reasons, Andrew Morton has been <a
href="/Articles/232763/">expressing some reservations</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And make no mistake: the latter disadvantage is huge.  Because if
	we do the PAGE_CACHE_SIZE hack (sorry, but it _is_), we have to do
	it *for ever*.  Maintaining and enhancing core MM and VFS becomes
	harder and more costly and slower and more buggy *for ever*.  The
	ramp for people to become competent on core MM becomes longer.  Our
	developer pool becomes smaller, and proportionally less skilled.
</div>
<p>
Andrew is not necessarily opposed to the patch; he is more concerned that
it not be merged until it has been carefully compared with the
alternatives.  He suggests keeping the page cache entry size unchanged, but
trying to allocate entries in higher-order groups.  That would result in
larger blocks being stored contiguously in memory without the memory
subsystem changes.  Filesystems could use those larger blocks, and hardware
could treat them as single units in scatter/gather lists for DMA, leading
to more efficient operations.
<p>
Another possibility which has been raised is raising the maximum size of
hardware scatter/gather lists or allowing them to be chained.  Drivers
could then set up larger I/O operations, improving efficiency without
requiring the other changes.
<p>

Still, there is support for Christoph's patch.  It would make support of
larger blocks relatively straightforward for the lower layers, perhaps
enabling the removal of some real hacks found in some drivers and
filesystems now.  The patch would also allow ext3 filesystems with larger
block sizes - sometimes created on ia64 systems, which use larger pages -
to be mounted on other architectures.  Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/Articles/232766/">likes the idea</a> that a higher-order page cache
could force a solution to the longstanding problem of physical memory
fragmentation.  To many, it seems like a straightforward and necessary
solution to a longstanding problem.
<p>

So the large block size idea is unlikely to just go away.  It may be a
while, though, before its proponents can do enough homework and
benchmarking to fully address the worries which have been expressed.
Fundamental changes are often the ones which take the longest to get into
the kernel, so there is little that is surprising here.  Just don't ask for
a prediction of the final outcome.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      hi,<br>
<p>
I'd like to say I LOVE the kernel page this week. Not that it's worse other weeks, but it's just such a great read that I felt the need to express my feelings about it. The articles are very informative, nicely written - the kernel page is surely my most favorite one in the Weekly News :D<br>
<p>
Though the frontpage is fun as well, a little controversy now and then doesn't hurt anybody ;-)<br>

      Is Andrew suggesting the creation of a scalable page cache size?<br>

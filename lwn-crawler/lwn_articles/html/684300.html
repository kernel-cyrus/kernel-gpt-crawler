The <a href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge pages</a> (THP) mechanism, in
the kernel since 2.6.38, allows the system to use huge (typically 2MB)
pages without application knowledge or involvement.  Huge pages can be a
significant performance improvement for a number of workloads.  The feature
only works with anonymous (application data) pages, though; support for
transparent huge pages for the page cache (file data) has never made it
into the mainline, despite the fact that the page cache often is the
biggest user of memory on the system.  There are, however, two working
implementations out there; the first task of the memory-management track at
the 2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit was to try
to choose between them.
<p>
One of the contenders is Kirill Shutemov's <a
href="/Articles/682933/">THP-enabled tmpfs</a> patch set.  Kirill's work is
based on <a href="/Articles/619514/">compound pages</a>, a fairly elaborate
mechanism for binding individual memory pages into a single, larger page.
The other solution is the <a href="/Articles/682623/">team-pages patch
set</a> from Hugh Dickins.  A "team page" can be thought of as a new,
arguably lighter-weight way of grouping pages together.  Hugh's work has
the advantage of having been deployed in production at Google for over a
year; that gives developers a relatively high level of confidence that it
lacks obscure bugs — always a nice feature in memory-management patches.
Even so, it became clear, the choice between the two is far from
straightforward.
<p>
<h4>Differing objectives</h4>
<p>
Kirill started off by saying that one of his primary goals was the ability
for applications to access individual 4KB subpages of a huge page without
the need to split the huge page itself.  The current anonymous THP
implementation does not have that property, but the ability to access
smaller subpages is more important in the page-cache setting.  Hugh, instead,
was more focused on getting things working quickly, meaning that a less
intrusive (but not necessarily smaller) implementation was required.
Compound pages, he said, are hard 
to manipulate; they also force a deeper level of integration with various
subsystems, including memory control groups, that he would rather avoid.
There was some back-and-forth on whether compound pages are truly more
complex than team pages, but without anything conclusions being reached.
<p>
Both implementations currently work with the tmpfs filesystem, which is a
start, but a proper transparent huge page cache implementation needs to
work with "real" filesystems as well.  Kirill stated that he is working on
that objective which, he asserted, will be more easily achieved with
compound pages than with the team-pages approach, which is known to
be incompatible with ext4 in its current form.

<p>
There was some discussion of how smaller files are handled.  Team pages are
assembled from individual pages, and, thus, should deal with small files
reasonably well.  A huge page will be allocated (memory availability
allowing) at the beginning, but isn't fully charged against the allocating
process.  If need be, the huge page can be split to return memory to the
system.  Compound pages seemingly have worse small-file performance at the
moment, allocating and charging a huge page from the outset.  That has led
to some testers reporting out-of-space errors with this patch set.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli, the original author of the THP feature, thought that
people were worrying too much about the small-file issue.  He said that THP
should be seen purely as a performance optimization.  Anybody who is
concerned about whether huge pages are using too much memory should simply
not enable the feature.
<p>
<h4>Sticking points</h4>
<p>
Hugh made the assertion that the choice was between one implementation that
is working, running on thousands of machines, and popular with its users
and another that, he said, is "getting there."  The team-pages code, he
said, is ready to go in, with the possible exception of review of the ABI
aspects — mount options, sysfs features, etc.  It quickly became clear that
there was no consensus for that in the room, though.
<p>
One of the key sticking points first came up at this time.  The current THP
code uses compound pages; Kirill's work is an extension of that approach.
The team-pages mechanism is, instead, entirely new.  If it is merged, the
kernel will be using different techniques for anonymous and page-cache huge
pages, essentially doubling (or worse) the amount of code that must be
maintained going forward.  Vlastimil Babka asked whether Hugh's patches
could be converted to use compound pages; Hugh said that might be possible,
but he would rather merge what he has now, then let Kirill do the
conversion later if he is interested in doing it.
<p>
Another issue is "recovery" — substituting a huge page for a set of small
pages at some future time if, for whatever reason, a huge page is not
allocated at the outset.  Team pages seem to have fewer problems with
recovery, especially in the case of small files that grow, since the
underlying huge page is allocated at the outset if possible.  Failing that,
either approach needs to run work in the background to coalesce
("collapse") sets of small pages into huge pages.  The team-pages patches
currently 
lack such a mechanism; compound pages appear to be in better shape in that
regard. 
<p>
There was some
discussion of details — whether the work should be done in the
<tt>khugepaged</tt> thread or in work queues in the context of the
processes owning the pages — but that was peripheral to the main issue.
As Mel Gorman put it, this question doesn't affect the decision that was
being discussed.
<p>
Mel went on to complain that the purpose of the session was to choose
between the two implementations, and that the group seemed no closer to
that objective.  This question has implications beyond just THP; he noted
that the team-pages patches are currently in Andrew Morton's -mm tree.
They are creating conflicts with other patches, notably his own <a
href="/Articles/683423/">node-accounting patches</a>.  If we are not
merging team pages for 4.7, he said, those patches should not be in -mm
(and, thus, in linux-next) at this time.  Hugh said he really wanted the
patches to get some exposure and testing, but that they could be backed out
for now if need be.
<p>
Kirill said that there is no reason to rush the team-pages patches into the
kernel now, just to add compound pages later.  That, he said, would just
add a bunch of churn.  But, Hugh said, it would also give Linux users the
opportunity to benefit from this work now, to which Kirill responded that
Hugh had held on to the patch set for a year, so there should be no urgency
now.  The team-pages patches are ready, and have been for six months or so,
Hugh said; he went on to say that, while Kirill has done well with the
compound-page work, he (Hugh) doesn't know how long it will be until he is
confident in that work.
<p>
<h4>Setting requirements</h4>
<p>
At about this point, Mel went to the front of the room in an attempt to
focus the group and get a decision made.  Using the flip chart, he started
a list of requirements each approach would have to meet before the room —
including the competing developer — would accept it into the mainline.  It
took a while, but some clear requirements did result.
<p>
On the compound-pages side, small files must not waste memory.  Mel noted
that, when the PowerPC architecture went to a 64KB native page size, the
amount of memory required to run a basic system quadrupled.  Andrea

<a href="/Articles/684362/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lsfmm/MelGorman-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250

align="left"></a> 

said that the anonymous THP implementation never allocates huge pages for
small virtual memory areas; THP for the page cache should make similar
decisions for small files.  Kirill said that something like this is
supported now via a mount option, but some work needs to be done.  Among
other things, the mount option should go away; things need to just work
without administrative tuning.  This
requirement was extended to include fast recovery when small files grow
into large files — the system should be able to swap in huge pages in short
order.
<p>
Hugh also suggested that compound pages need to demonstrate a high level
of robustness before it could be considered.  This requirement was seen as
being somewhat unfair, though: it is easy to show a lack of robustness, but
difficult to show its presence.  In the end, it will be incumbent on Hugh
to show which robustness problems, if any, exist in the compound-pages
implementation.
<p>

One of the requirements for team pages is similar: it has to have a
recovery mechanism for files that didn't get huge pages assigned
initially.  In particular, <tt>khugepaged</tt> or something like it must be
able to collapse pages when appropriate.
<p>
The harder requirement, though, is to move away from having independent
mechanisms for anonymous and page-cache pages.  If the team pages approach
is to be adopted, there must be a plausible commitment to implement team
pages for anonymous pages as well.  If, once the implementation is in
place, it is shown (in the form of performance problems, for example) that
the problems are sufficiently different that two
approaches are necessary, the two  can remain separate.  But
until such a thing has been conclusively demonstrated, the goal needs to be
a single approach for both cases.  There is a lot of concern about
excessive complexity in the memory-management code; few people want to add
to it.
<p>
Finally, the current incompatibility between team pages and non-tmpfs
filesystems (the ext4
filesystem in particular) needs to be resolved.  In practice that means that
team pages must stop using the PagePrivate flag, since ext4 (along with
other filesystems) is already using it.
<p>
The session concluded with both Kirill and Hugh agreeing that, if the other
developer's system met the requirements, they would not block its merging.
Hugh also agreed that team pages would come out of the -mm tree for now,
since it is not destined for merging in 4.7.  What will be merged in
subsequent cycles remains to be seen; it would not be entirely surprising
if it were a topic of discussion again at LSFMM 2017.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 22, 2009</br>
           </div>
When kernel developers engage in an extended discussion on the writing of
changelogs for patches, one might well conclude that they have run out of
useful things to do.  But arguments over changelogs are not the same as
spelling or grammar flames.  In an environment where 10,000 or so changes
are merged in every three-month development cycle, developers need all the
help they can get to understand what is going into the kernel.
Poorly-described patches are harder to understand, and harder to find when
searching the history for something specific.  So getting changelogs right
helps the development process - and the kernel - as a whole.
<p>
It all started innocently enough; Linus was engaging in <a
href="/Articles/329430/">a routine patch flaming</a> when he encountered
one of the "Impact:" tags that some developers (especially those working
with Ingo Molnar's trees) have adopted in recent months:
<p>
<pre>
    Impact: clarify and extend confusing API
</pre>
<p>
Suffice to say that he was not much impressed with it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And what the hell is up with these bogus "Impact:" things? Who
	started doing that, and why? If your single-line explanation at the
	top is not good enough, and your multi-line explanation isn't clear
	enough, then you should fix the OTHER parts, not add that _idiotic_
	"Impact" statement.
</div>
<p>
From there, the extended conversation focused on two related topics: the
value of "impact" tags and how to write better changelogs in general.  On
the former, the primary (but not only) proponent of these tags is Ingo
Molnar, who <a href="/Articles/329435/">cites several benefits</a> from
their use.  Using these tags, he claims, forces developers to write smaller
patches which can be adequately described in a single line.  They give
subsystem maintainers an easy way to assess the changes made by a set of
patches and their associated risk; they also make it easier to review a
patch against its declared "impact."  These tags are also said to force a
certain clarity of thought, making developers think through the
consequences of a change.
<p>
Most of these arguments leave "Impact:" detractors unmoved, though.  Rather
than add yet another tag to a patch, they would prefer to see developers
just write better changelogs from the outset.  In a properly-documented
patch, the new tag is just irrelevant.  <a href="/Articles/329439/">Andrew
Morton said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm getting quite a few Impact:s now and I must say that the
	Impact: line is always duplicative of the Subject:.  Except in a
	few cases, and that's because the Subject: sucked.
</div>
<p>
Ingo <a href="/Articles/329441/">disputed</a> that claim at length,
needless to say.  But he takes things further by stating that, while better
changelogs would certainly be desirable, they are not a practical goal.
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328686/">According to Ingo</a>, most
developers are simply not capable of writing good changelogs.  Language
barriers and such often are part of this problem, but it goes deeper: most
developers simply lack the writing skills needed to write clear and concise
changelogs.  This fact of life, as Ingo sees it, cannot really be changed,
but most developers can, at least, be trained to write a reasonable impact
tag.
<p>
It is probably fair to say that most developers do not see themselves as
being disabled in this way.  That said, it is also fair to say that a lot
of patches go into the mainline with unhelpful changelogs.  That can
probably be changed - to an extent at least - through pressure from
maintainers and a better understanding of what makes a good changelog.
In an attempt to help, your editor has proposed a brief addition to
Documentation/development-process:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Writing good changelogs is a crucial but often-neglected art; it's
	worth spending another moment discussing this issue.  When writing
	a changelog, you should bear in mind that a number of different
	people will be reading your words.  These include subsystem
	maintainers and reviewers who need to decide whether the patch
	should be included, distributors and other maintainers trying to
	decide whether a patch should be backported to other kernels, bug
	hunters wondering whether the patch is responsible for a problem
	they are chasing, users who want to know how the kernel has
	changed, and more.  A good changelog conveys the needed information
	to all of these people in the most direct and concise way possible.
<p>
	To that end, the summary line should describe the effects of and
	motivation for the change as well as possible given the one-line
	constraint.  The detailed description can then amplify on those
	topics and provide any needed additional information.  If the patch
	fixes a bug, cite the commit which introduced the bug if possible.
	If a problem is associated with specific log or compiler output,
	include that output to help others searching for a solution to the
	same problem.  If the change is meant to support other changes
	coming in later patch, say so.  If internal APIs are changed,
	detail those changes and how other developers should respond.  In
	general, the more you can put yourself into the shoes of everybody
	who will be reading your changelog, the better that changelog (and
	the kernel as a whole) will be.
</div>
<p>
Other possible additions have been proposed by <a
href="/Articles/329443/">Ted Ts'o</a> and <a href="/Articles/329444/">Paul
Gortmaker</a>.  Of course, all of these patches are based on the optimistic
notion that developers will actually read the documentation.
<p>
One could argue that the kernel community is rather late in getting around
to this kind of discussion.  That could be said to be par for the course;
in the pre-BitKeeper era (i.e. up to February, 2002), there was almost no
tracking of individual changes into the kernel at all.  That the fine
points of changelogging are being discussed a mere seven years later
suggests things are going in the right direction.   The level of
professionalism in the kernel community has been on the rise for a long
time; this process is likely to continue.  Whether or not some variant on
the impact tag is used in the future, one can assume that the quality of
changelogs will, as a whole, be better.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Rather than expecting the sum of a certain number (>= 1) of changelogs to equal an understandable story, perhaps someone should simply <em>write</em> that story -- but this, of course, is the eternal problem of documentation in the first place: if you're not a poet, it is hard to see the need.

<p>
*sigh*<br>
<p>
Counter to intuition, I understand from a number of people who write for a living, as well as from personal experience, that it is a good deal harder to write something short than something long. Usefully capturing the important details of a patch in a single line is *much* harder than explaining what it does in a couple of paragraphs. Encouraging single-line changelogs scares me.<br>

The Impact line is not a replacement for a change log, it is simply the reason for the patch.<br>
<p>
Well, that is the way I prefer to think of it. When Ingo asked me to start including Impact lines, I struggled with it. I'm guilty of doing the<br>
<p>
  Impact: cleanup<br>
<p>
that Linus complained about. Because, really, that is useless. But trying to come up with an "Impact" for the patch I found very difficult. But now I think of it more as the reason for the patch, not what the patch actually does. This is the typical changelog I submit:<br>
<p>
Subject: ....<br>
<p>
Detail description of the what the patch does.<br>
<p>
[ Impact: what is the purpose of the patch. ]<br>
<p>
Signed-off-by: ....<br>
<p>
Here's an example:<br>
<p>
    ring-buffer: only warn on wrap if buffer is bigger than two pages<br>
    <br>
    On boot up, to save memory, ftrace allocates the minimum buffer<br>
    which is two pages. Ftrace also goes through a series of tests<br>
    (when configured) on boot up. These tests can fill up a page within<br>
    a single interrupt.<br>
    <br>
    The ring buffer also has a WARN_ON when it detects that the buffer was<br>
    completely filled within a single commit (other commits are allowed to<br>
    be nested).<br>
    <br>
    Combine the small buffer on start up, with the tests that can fill more<br>
    than a single page within an interrupt, this can trigger the WARN_ON.<br>
    <br>
    This patch makes the WARN_ON only happen when the ring buffer consists<br>
    of more than two pages.<br>
    <br>
    [ Impact: prevent false WARN_ON in ftrace startup tests ]<br>
<p>
<p>
The subject and description describe what the patch does. The description may even go into detail of the history that caused this patch. But the Impact line is simply a one liner summary of the purpose of the patch.<br>

If that's what Impact: means, it really should have been Purpose:.<br>
<p>
Impact means "what does this cause" or "what does this effect",<br>
not "what is this for".<br>

I suspect if Ingo had used Purpose: there might have been little or no objection.<br>

That is what I take as the meaning of Impact. It is not what Ingo told me. There's a fine line between "Impact" and "Purpose". And although I view it as the purpose of the patch, the line itself does show an impact of the patch. But to find the Impact, I must first look for the purpose.<br>
<p>
I can say, the impact of that patch is the prevention of false warn ons. There is a very subtle difference between the two.<br>

<P>
One obvious difference is in the case of side effects (either temporary or long-term, e.g., "out-of-tree drivers depending on foobar semantics will no longer work").  In that situation the purpose is one thing, and the impact presumably includes that thing, but it also includes the side effects:  i.e., the impact is a superset of the purpose (in such cases).

The thing I miss in most changelogs is that they often discuss what changed, while you can see that by looking at the patch. What you want is *why* it was changed. What is performance, a bug, a feature, some forgotten corner case, or something else?<br>
<p>
The entries that bug me the most: "Refactor code XYZ" (sometimes with more words, but the result is the same). Completely useless, since it doesn't explain what was wrong with the old way or why the new way is better.<br>

Having seen several Impact: lines (now that they're at the bottom with the <br>
signoffs and etc) in the mainline changelogs of late, I can say one thing <br>
for sure -- they've DEFINITELY improved changelog usability here.<br>
<p>
I don't claim to be a C coder let alone a kernel coder.  Computing and <br>
therefore Linux is a hobby for me, not a job, so I'm not a pro, either.  <br>
Despite that, I take seriously the responsibility of being the sysadmin on <br>
my own systems.  As such, I like to have at least a general idea of what <br>
sort of changes are happening in both kernel and userspace and spend quite <br>
some time keeping track of such things.<br>
<p>
As such I'm no stranger to kernel changelogs altho I don't pretend to <br>
understand even the half of them.  I still like to think they help me <br>
follow the general trends, etc, and I know I've certainly been able to <br>
help not only myself but others based on it.  But while many of the the <br>
titles and descriptions "are Greek to me", those Impact: lines I normally <br>
CAN understand.  It makes my job as an admin, NOT a coder, vastly easier, <br>
because unlike much of the rest of the changelog, the Impact: lines tend <br>
to be close enough to "sysadmin dialect English", as opposed to "kernel <br>
hacker dialect English", that they actually make sense.<br>
<p>
Additionally, with the Impact statements now at the end, the effect of the <br>
overall format is the same thing composition teachers have been teaching <br>
for years.  "Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell it, then tell <br>
them what you told them."  That's pretty much what the changelog order <br>
does now, beginning with a one-line title/summary, followed by a detailed <br>
explanation, then ending with the practical effect it'll have and <br>
finishing off with the "rolling of the credits".  There's a reason that <br>
format is so familiar in papers, etc. -- it "just works". =:^)<br>
<p>
So I really like seeing the Impact lines at the end of the description and <br>
hope it becomes standard practice, just like sign-off-by, etc. It really <br>
DOES make a difference.  =:^)<br>

It is rare for Linus to talk about what he plans to merge in a given
development cycle before the merge window opens; it seems that he prefers
to see what the pull requests look like and make his decisions afterward.
He made an exception in <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/398371/">the
2.6.35 announcement</a>, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	On a slightly happier note: one thing I do hope we can merge in the
	upcoming merge window is Nick Piggin's cool VFS scalability series.
	I've been using it on my own machine, and gone through all the
	commits (not that I shouldn't go through some of them some more),
	and am personally really excited about it. It's seldom we see major
	performance improvements in core code that are quite that
	noticeable, and Nick's whole RCU pathname lookup in particular just
	tickles me pink.
</div>
<p>
It's a rare developer who, upon having tickled the Big Penguin to that
particular shade, will hold off on merging his changes.  But Nick <a
href="/Articles/401743/">asked that the patches sit out for one more
cycle</a>, perhaps out of the entirely rational fear of bugs which might
irritate users to a rather deeper shade.  So Linus will have to wait a bit
for his RCU pathname lookup code.
That said, some parts of the VFS scalability code did make it into the
mainline for 2.6.36-rc2.
<p>
Like most latter-day scalability work, the VFS work is focused on
increasing locality and eliminating situations where CPUs must share
resources.  Given that a filesystem is an inherently global structure,
increasing locality can be a challenging task; as a result, parts of Nick's
patch set are on the complex and tricky side.  But, in the end, it comes
down to dealing with things locally whenever possible, but making global
action possible when the need arises.
<p>
The first step is the introduction of two new lock types, the first of
which is called a "local/global lock" (lglock).  An lglock is intended to
provide very fast access to per-CPU data while making it possible (at a
rather higher cost) to get at another CPU's data.  An lglock is created
with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/lglock.h&gt;

    DEFINE_LGLOCK(name);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>DEFINE_LGLOCK()</tt> macro is a 99-line wonder which creates the
necessary data structure and accessor functions.  By design, lglocks can
only be defined at the file global level; they are not intended to be
embedded within data structures.
<p>
Another set of macros is used for working with the lock:
<p>
<pre>
    lg_lock_init(name);
    lg_local_lock(name);
    lg_local_unlock(name);
    lg_local_lock_cpu(name, int cpu);
    lg_local_unlock_cpu(name, int cpu);
</pre>
<p>
Underneath it all, an lglock is really just a per-CPU array of spinlocks.
So a call to <tt>lg_local_lock()</tt> will acquire the current CPU's
spinlock, while <tt>lg_local_lock_cpu()</tt> will acquire the lock
belonging to the specified <tt>cpu</tt>.  Acquiring an lglock also disables
preemption, which would not otherwise happen in realtime kernels.  As long
as almost all locking is local, it will be very fast; the lock will not
bounce between CPUs and will not be contended.  Both of those assumptions
go away, of course, if the cross-CPU version is used.
<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to globally lock the lglock:
<p>
<pre>
    lg_global_lock(name);
    lg_global_unlock(name);
    lg_global_lock_online(name);
    lg_global_unlock_online(name);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>lg_global_lock()</tt> will go through the entire array,
acquiring the spinlock for every CPU.  Needless to say, this will be a very
expensive operation; if it happens with any frequency at all, an lglock is
probably the wrong primitive to use.  The <tt>_online</tt> version only
acquires locks for CPUs which are currently running, while
<tt>lg_global_lock()</tt> acquires locks for all possible CPUs.
<p>
The VFS scalability patch set also brings back the "big reader lock"
concept.  The idea behind a brlock is to make locking for read access as
fast as possible, while making write locking possible.  The brlock API
(also defined in <tt>&lt;linux/lglock.h&gt;</tt>) looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_BRLOCK(name);

    br_lock_init(name);
    br_read_lock(name);
    br_read_unlock(name);
    br_write_lock(name);
    br_write_unlock(name);
</pre>
<p>
As it happens, this version of brlocks is implemented entirely with
lglocks; <tt>br_read_lock()</tt> maps directly to <tt>lg_local_lock()</tt>,
and <tt>br_write_lock()</tt> turns into <tt>lg_global_lock()</tt>.
<p>

The first use of lglocks is to protect the list of open files which is
attached to each superblock structure.  This list is currently protected by
the global <tt>files_lock</tt>, which becomes a bottleneck when a lot of
<tt>open()</tt> and <tt>close()</tt> calls are being made.  In 2.6.36, the
list of open files becomes a per-CPU array, with each CPU managing its own
list.  When a file is opened, a (cheap) call to <tt>lg_local_lock()</tt>
suffices to protect the local list while the new file is added.
<p>
When a file is closed, things are just a bit more complicated.  There is no
guarantee that the file will be on the local CPU's list, so the VFS must be
prepared to reach across to another CPU's list to clean things up.  That,
of course, is what <tt>lg_local_lock_cpu()</tt> is for.  Cross-CPU locking
will be more expensive than local locking, but (1)&nbsp;it only involves
one other CPU, and (2)&nbsp;in situations where there is a lot of opening
and closing of files, chances are that the process working with any
specific file will not migrate between CPUs during the (presumably short)
time that the file is open.
<p>
The real reason that the per-superblock open files list exists is to let
the kernel check for writable files when a filesystem is being remounted
read-only.  That operation requires exclusive access to the entire list, so
<tt>lg_global_lock()</tt> is used.  The global lock is costly, but
read-only remounts are not a common occurrence, so nobody is likely to
notice. 
<p>
Also for 2.6.36, Nick changed the global <tt>vfsmount_lock</tt> into a
brlock.  This lock protects the tree of mounted filesystems; it must be
acquired (in a read-only mode) whenever a pathname lookup crosses from one
mount point to the next.  Write access is only needed when filesystems are
mounted or unmounted - again, an uncommon occurrence on most systems.  Nick
warns that this change is unlikely to speed up most workloads now - indeed,
it may slow some down slightly - but its value will become clearer when
some of the other bottlenecks are taken care of.
<p>
Aside from a few smaller changes, that is where VFS scalability work stops
for the 2.6.36 development cycle.  The more complicated work - dealing with
<tt>dcache_lock</tt> in particular - will go through a few more months of
testing before it is pushed toward the mainline.  Then, perhaps, we'll see
Linus in a proper shade of pink.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

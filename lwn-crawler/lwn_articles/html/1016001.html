The kernel's slab allocator is charged with providing small objects on
demand; its performance and reliability are crucial for the functioning of
the system as a whole.  At the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, two adjacent sessions in the
memory-management track dug into current work on the slab allocator.  The
first focused on the new sheaves feature, while the second discussed a set
of allocation functions that are safe to call in any context.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
<h4>Ask sheaves</h4>
<p>
Sheaves are a new caching layer for the slab allocator that is intended to
increase performance for heavy users; see <a href="/Articles/1010667/">this
article</a> for a detailed description of how they work.  Vlastimil Babka,
the maintainer of the slab allocator, led the first session to discuss this
feature and its future.  He started by saying that some workloads are
experiencing slowdowns as a result of a lot of slab allocations; some of
that is explainable by how the slab allocator must track free objects
within folios using an embedded free list.  The folios containing the
slabs must also be tracked, and maintaining NUMA locality adds another
level of complexity.

<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016004/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/VlastimilBabka-sm.png" alt="[Vlastimil Babka]"
title="Vlastimil Babka" class="lthumb"></a>

Sheaves bypass much of that work by maintaining a simple per-CPU cache in
the form of two sheaves (arrays of free objects) for each CPU.  It is
currently an opt-in feature, but he wondered if it should just be enabled
for all slabs.  The caching makes freeing objects cheap, and there is
integration with the read-copy-update system to reduce the cost of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/include/linux/rcupdate.h#L1034"><tt>kfree_rcu()</tt></a>.
The allocator can also provide pre-filled sheaves on request that can be
used to guarantee allocations in restricted contexts.  This last feature
comes nearly for free since, with luck, the allocator will have a sheaf
with sufficient objects just sitting there when the request arrives.
<p>
In summary, he said, the initial results from the sheaves layer are
promising, but its interaction with slab debugging needs improvement.
One question he had was: how much of a problem is the relative lack of NUMA
awareness?  Much of the complexity of the full object-freeing path in the
slab allocator is the pains it takes to return freed objects to the proper
NUMA node.  Sheaves short all of that logic out and simply store free
objects in the local CPU's sheaf, with the result that there
will be more cross-node allocations.  On systems with high cross-node
access costs, that could perhaps change the performance characteristics of
some workloads.  For maple trees, which are the first user of sheaves, the
allocations are used system-wide, so NUMA locality is less of a concern.
<p>
He wondered again whether sheaves should be enabled for all users, though
he worried that such a move might turn the current slab allocator into
something more like its predecessor, which was recently removed.  Perhaps,
he suggested, sheaves could replace some of the other caching currently
done in the slab allocator, maybe even to the point of replacing the
current free-object tracking entirely.  That would bring some challenges;
without the free-object tracking, the allocator would need another way to
recognize that a given slab has been entirely freed and can be returned to
the page allocator, for example.
<p>
As the session came to an end, Rik van Riel said that lock contention can
be a real problem in the slab allocator now, and that sheaves look like
they could help.  Hoang Nhat Pham agreed, saying that he works with systems
that have a large number of CPUs but only one NUMA node, leading to a lot
of lock contention that would be improved by the per-CPU cache.
<p>
<h4><tt>kmalloc()</tt> for any context</h4>
<p>
Alexei Starovoitov then took over to run a joint session with the BPF track
on work toward creating a version of <tt>kmalloc()</tt> (which is part of
the slab allocator) that can be called from BPF programs in any context.
Some BPF attachment points, including tracepoints, can be invoked from any
context, even non-maskable interrupts (NMIs).  The system's freedom to
satisfy allocation requests can be highly constrained in those contexts, so
care must be taken.  The BPF subsystem has, for a few years, used a custom
allocator to fill this need, but there is a desire to reduce the number of
allocators (and object caches) in the kernel.  See <a
href="/Articles/1014220/#bpf">this article</a> for an overview of his
proposed solution.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016006/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/AlexeiStarovoitov-sm.png" alt="[Alexei
Starovoitov]" title="Alexei Starovoitov" class="lthumb"></a>

Starovoitov began by thanking Babka for <a href="/Articles/974138/">the
2024 LSFMM+BPF session on the slab allocator</a>, without which he would
not have had the courage to attempt this work.  There are, he said, a lot
of wrappers around the slab allocator in the kernel; there are different
excuses for the existence of each.  For BPF, the primary excuse was the
need to be able to allocate in any context; performance is also important,
but it is a secondary concern.
<p>
Eleven years ago, he said, only the tracing and networking subsystems
supported BPF programs.  Tracing programs did not allocate memory, and the
networking programs were only called in process context, so memory
allocation was not a concern.  Over time, though, the need for memory
allocations in BPF programs grew; it was addressed initially with the BPF
"maps" feature.  Maps can have preallocated memory, but each map might end
up preallocating 10KB of memory.  That makes for a fast solution, but also
leads to a lot of wasted memory.  There have been some attempts to improve
the situation, but they tend not to work well and are not heavily used.
<p>
So the BPF memory allocator was added.  It provides per-CPU buckets (to
allocate objects of different sizes) like <tt>kmalloc()</tt> does, but it
was designed to be NMI-safe and fast.  At its core is a function called
<tt>bpf_mem_alloc()</tt> to do the actual allocations.  It was not as
wasteful as map preallocation, but there is still a lot of memory that just
sits in its caches.  Some of that waste could be addressed by merging
caches the way the slab allocator does — but that is just yet another step
along the path of reimplementing features that the slab allocator already
has.
<p>
So it would be nice to be able to just use <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, but that
allocation path is complex and heads into increasingly slow paths when
needed to satisfy a request.  The slowest steps can involve obtaining
blocks from the zone allocator or waking the <tt>kswapd</tt> thread.  In the
wrong contexts, that path could lead to kernel deadlocks; using it would
be, he said, "<q>a ticking time bomb</q>".
<p>
So, instead, he has added <tt>try_alloc_pages()</tt>, which handles the
lower-level page-allocation part of the task.  It follows the
same allocation path but stops short of taking actions that could deadlock
the system.  It is thus more likely to fail than other allocation paths.
Most of the needed logic, he said, was already in place, there were only a
few changes needed.  Van Riel wondered, since conditional locking is used
in this path, what happens if an attempt to take a lock to charge an
allocation to a control group fails?  In that case, Starovoitov answered,
the entire allocation will fail.
<p>
<tt>try_alloc_pages()</tt>, as can be seen from its name, is a page-level
allocator; the next step is to create an all-context version of
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> as well.  That should be fairly straightforward,
involving mostly mechanical changes, he said, but he is considering
relaxing the node-locality requirements that <tt>kmalloc()</tt> upholds.
It is better to allocate something than to fail the request because the
only available memory is on a remote node.  If the slab allocator needs
more memory to satisfy a request, it will use <tt>try_alloc_pages()</tt> to
attempt to allocate it.  The code is written, he said, but is not yet ready
for review.
<p>
Van Riel asked how freeing works in this new interface; Starovoitov
answered that, if it is not possible to obtain the needed locks to properly
free a memory object, that memory will be added locklessly to a linked
list instead, and the next non-atomic free call will take care of it.
<p>
When this code was initially posted, memory-management subsystem maintainer
Andrew Morton expressed opposition to it.  He had been quiet during this
session until the end, when Starovoitov asked whether that silence meant
that his concerns had been addressed.  Morton answered that he is still not
entirely happy about this work, which addresses use cases that are not at
all important relative to the core page allocator.  It adds some run-time
and maintenance overhead, he said, that would be best placed elsewhere so
that only its users pay the cost.  Starovoitov said that there is no
measurable performance impact on the page allocator; Morton expressed
skepticism and said that maintainability is important too, but seemed to
grudgingly accept this change.
<p>
The <tt>try_alloc_pages()</tt> changes <a

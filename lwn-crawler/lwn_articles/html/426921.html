<p>
With some regularity, the topic of allowing multiple Linux Security Modules
(LSMs) to all be active comes up in the Linux kernel community.  There have
been some attempts at "stacking" or "chaining" LSMs in the past, but
nothing has ever made it into the mainline.  On the other hand, though,
every time a developer comes up with some kind of security hardening patch
for the kernel, they are generally directed toward the LSM interface.
Because the "monolithic" security solutions (like SELinux, AppArmor, and
others) tend to have already taken the single existing LSM slot in many
distributions, these simpler, more targeted LSMs are generally unable to be
used.  But a discussion on the linux-security-module mailing list
suggests that work is being done that just might solve this problem.
</p>

<p>
The existing implementation of LSMs uses a single set of function pointers
in a <tt>struct&nbsp;security_operations</tt>
for the "hooks" that get called when access decisions need to be made.
Once a security module gets registered (typically at boot time using the
<tt>security=</tt> flag), its implementation is stored in the structure and
any other LSM is out of luck.  The idea behind LSM stacking would be to
keep multiple versions of the <tt>security_operations</tt> structure around
and to call each registered LSM's hooks for an access decision.  While that
sounds fairly straightforward, there are some subtleties that need to be
addressed, especially if different LSMs give different answers for a
particular access.
</p>

<p>
This problem with the semantics of "composing" two (or more) LSMs has been
discussed at various points, without any real global solution for composing
arbitrary LSMs.  As Serge E. Hallyn <a href="/Articles/368838/">warned</a>
over a year ago:
<div class="BigQuote">
The problem is that composing any two security policies can quickly have
subtle, unforeseen, but dangerous effects.  That's why so far we have
stuck with the status quo where only one LSM is 'active', but that LSM
can manually call hooks from other LSMs.
</div>
<p>
There is one example of stacking LSMs as Hallyn describes in the
kernel already; the capabilities LSM is called directly from
other 
LSMs where necessary.  That 
particular approach is not very general, of course, as LSM maintainers are
likely to lose patience with adding calls for every other possible LSM.  A
more easily expandable solution is required.

<p>
David Howells posted a <a href="/Articles/426890/">set of patches</a> that
would add that expansion mechanism.  It does that by allowing multiple
calls to the <tt>register_security()</tt> initialization function, each
with its own set of <tt>security_operations</tt>.  Instead of the current
situation, where each LSM manages its own data for each kind of object
(credentials, keys, files, inodes, superblocks, IPC, and sockets), Howell's
security framework will allocate and manage that data for the LSMs. 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>security_operations</tt> structure gets new <tt>*_data_size</tt>
and <tt>*_data_offset</tt> fields for each kind of object, with the former
filled in by the LSM 
before calling <tt>register_security()</tt> and the latter being managed by
the framework.  The data size field tells the framework how much space is
needed for the LSM-specific data for that type of object, and the offset is
used by the framework to find each LSM's private data. For
<tt>struct&nbsp;cred</tt>, <tt>struct&nbsp;key</tt>, 
<tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt>, and <tt>struct&nbsp;super_block</tt>, the extra
data for each registered LSM is tacked onto the end of the structure rather
than going through an intermediate pointer (as is required for the others).
Wrappers are defined that will allow an LSM to extract its data from an
object based on the new fields in the operations table. 
</p>

<p>
The framework then maintains a list of registered LSMs and puts the
capabilities LSM in the first slot of the list.  When one of the security
hooks is 
called, the framework iterates over the list and calls the
corresponding hook for each registered LSM.  Depending on the specific
hook, different kinds of iterators are used, but the usual iterator looks
for a non-zero response from an LSM's hook, which would indicate a denial
of some kind, and returns that to the framework.  The other iterators are
used for specialized calls, for example when there is no return value or
when only the first hook found should be called. The upshot is that the
hooks for registered LSMs get called in order (with capabilities coming
first), and the first to deny the access "wins".  Because the capabilities
calls are pulled out separately, that also means that the other LSMs no
longer have to make those calls themselves; instead the framework will
handle it for them.
</p>

<p>
But there are a handful of hooks that do not work very well in a multi-LSM
environment, in particular the <tt>secid</tt> (an LSM-specific security label
ID) handling routines (e.g. <tt>secid_to_secctx()</tt>,
<tt>task_getsecid()</tt>, etc.).  Howells's current implementation just
calls the hook of the first LSM it finds that implements it, which
is not going to make it possible to use multiple LSMs that all implement
those hooks (currently just SELinux and Smack).  Howells's <a
href="/Articles/427105/">solution</a> is to explicitly ban that particular
combination:
<div class="BigQuote">
I think the obvious thing is to reject any chosen module that implements any of
these interfaces if we've already selected a module that implements them.  That
would mean you can choose either Smack or SELinux, but not both.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Smack developer Casey Schaufler isn't <a
href="/Articles/427107/">convinced</a> that is the right course:
"<q>That kind of takes the wind out of the sails, doesn't it?</q>" He
would rather see a more general solution that allows multiple
<tt>secid</tt>s, and the related <tt>secctx</tt>s (security contexts), to
be handled by the framework:
<div class="BigQuote">
It does mean that there needs to be a standard for a secctx that allows
for the presence of multiple concurrent LSMs. There will have to be an
interface whereby either the composer/stacker can break a secctx into its
constituent parts or with which an LSM can pull the bit it cares about
out. In either case the LSMs may need to be [updated] to accept a secctx
in a standardized format.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Another interesting part of Schaufler's message is that he has been working
on an "<q>alternative approach</q>" to the multi-LSM problem that he
calls "Glass".  The code is, as yet, unreleased, but Schaufler describes
Glass as an LSM that composes other LSMs:
<div class="BigQuote">
 The Glass security blob is an array of
pointers, one for each available LSM, including commoncap, which
is always in the last slot. The Glass LSM is always registered first.
As subsequent LSMs register they are added to the glass LSM vector.
When a hook is invoked glass goes through its vector and if the
LSM provides a hook it gets called, and the return remembered.
If any other LSM provided a hook the commoncap hook is skipped,
but if no LSM was invoked commoncap is called.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Unlike Howells's proposal, Glass would leave the calls to the
capabilities LSM (aka commoncap) in the existing LSMs, and only call
commoncap if no LSM implemented a given hook.  The idea is that the LSMs
already handle the capabilities calls in their hooks as needed, so it is
only when none of those get called that requires a call into commoncap.  In
addition, Glass leaves the allocation and management of the security
"blobs" (LSM-specific data for objects) to the LSMs rather than
centralizing them in 
the framework as Howells's patches do. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to various other differences, there is a more fundamental
difference in the way that the two solutions handle multiple LSMs that all have
hooks for a particular security operation.  Glass purposely calls each hook
in each registered LSM, whereas Howells's proposal typically short-circuits
the chain 
of hooks once one of them has denied the access.  Schaufler's <a
href="/Articles/427126/">idea</a> is that 
an LSM should be able to maintain state, which means that skipping its
hooks could potentially skew the access decision:
<div class="BigQuote">
My dreaded case is an LSM that bases controls on statistical frequency
of access to files. There is no way you could skip any of its hooks,
and I don't see off hand any file access hook it wouldn't use. I have
heard people (think credit card companies) suggest such things, so
although I don't have use for it I can't discount the potential for it.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of other issues to resolve, including things like handling
<tt>/proc/self/attr/current</tt> (which contains the security ID for the
current process) because various user-space programs already parse the
output of that file, though it is different depending on which LSM is
active.  A standardized format for that file, which takes multiple
LSMs into account, might be better, but it would break the kernel ABI and
is thus not likely to pass muster. Overall, though, Howells and Schaufler
were making some good 
progress on defining the requirements for supporting multiple LSMs.
Schaufler is <a href="/Articles/427130/">optimistic</a> that the
collaboration will bear fruit: "<q>I think that we may be
able to get past the problems that have held multiple LSMs back this
time around.</q>"
</p>

<p>
So far, there is only the code from Howells to look at, but Schaufler has
promised to make Glass available soon.  With luck, that will lead to a
multi-LSM solution that the LSM developers can coalesce behind, whether it
comes from Howells, Schaufler, or a collaboration between them.  There may
still be a fair amount of resistance from Linus Torvalds and other kernel
hackers, but the <a href="/Articles/368730/">lack</a> of any way to combine
LSMs <a href="/Articles/393008/">comes up</a> too often for it
to be ignored forever.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are memory devices coming down the pike that have different
performance characteristics than traditional DRAM.  Linux will need to
support these devices, but there is a question whether they should be
treated as traditional memory that is managed by the kernel or if they
should be presented as separate devices with their own drivers.  Dan
Williams led a plenary discussion on that topic on the second day of the
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.

<p>
Technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint">3D
XPoint</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">High Bandwidth
Memory</a> (HBM) perform differently from DRAM.  These types of devices
might also be
mirrored or serve as caches for slower memory.  So
applications may need to know that there is a limited amount of
high-performance memory available, with more, slower memory behind that cache.
</p>

<p>
If the memory-management subsystem is to handle this type of memory, it
could be classified as a memory zone or some kind of NUMA node.  There will
be a need to find this memory by its type and location, so there may be a
need for a new type of memory, Williams said, rather than tracking it as a
"crazy kind of NUMA node".
</p>

<p>
High-performance computing (HPC) applications, databases, and other
applications that know how to do their own buffer management just need the
kernel to tell them what type it is and where it is.  The kernel would then
get out of the way and let the application manage that space.  To Williams,
that seems like a device.
</p>

<p>
Other applications, though, simply want something sane done with that
memory.  They don't need strong guarantees about what type of memory is
used.  That seems more like a memory-management subsystem job to him.
</p>

<p>
It comes down to whether the memory is tracked with <a href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt></a> or
not, Ted Ts'o said.  Williams thinks that the memory would start off being
managed as a device without page structures, but it could be handed
off to the memory-management subsystem at some point, which would create
the page structures at that point.
</p>

<p>
For persistent memory, there is a use case for hypervisors or databases
that don't need a filesystem.  The persistent memory can be carved up, in a
way similar to partitions, then handed out in huge regions to these
applications.   Keith Packard said that for his work (on <a
href="/Articles/655437/">The Machine</a>), the plan is to put a filesystem
on top of chunks of persistent memory.  But some of that memory can also be
hotplugged into the kernel and get 
page structures at that time.
</p>

<p>
The device side of things is fairly well understood, Williams said.  It
presents a file or device that an application can <tt>mmap()</tt> into its
address space.  The problem comes when you want to get the
memory-management subsystem involved.  He asked, is there a need to have
something besides NUMA nodes to direct applications to the different memory
types?
</p>

<p>
Rik van Riel said that there is some existing code to direct applications
to certain types of memory.  What is missing, though, is a way to evict
pages from faster memory back to slower memory.  Williams said that
persistent memory can have swap memory associated with it, which might form
the basis of a rudimentary migration strategy.  But it seemed to him that
what was really needed was to send some patches for discussion.
</p>

<p>
The memory access patterns will need to be tracked for different regions,
Van Riel said, so that memory management can make decisions on migration
and placement.  There is some information available from the CPU
performance counters, but that will not cover memory accesses, so there
will need to be a way to track processes that are using the wrong type of
memory. 
</p>

<p>
There is also a need for a unified way for different architectures to
describe this memory to user space.  But Packard wondered if would make
sense to wait and see what the applications actually need.  For now, he
plans to simply expose the hardware and let the application developers
figure out what more they need.

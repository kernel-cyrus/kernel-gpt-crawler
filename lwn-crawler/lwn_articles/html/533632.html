<h1>GPIO in the kernel: future directions</h1>

           </div>
<a href="/Articles/532714/">Last week's article</a> covered the kernel's
current internal API for general-purpose I/O (GPIO) lines.  The GPIO API has seen
relatively little change in recent years, but that situation may be about
to change as the result of a couple of significant patch sets that
seek to rework how the GPIO API works in the interest of greater robustness
and better performance.
<p>
<h4>No more numbers</h4>
<p>
The current GPIO API relies on simple integers to identify specific GPIO
lines.  It works, but there are some shortcomings to this approach.  Kernel
code is rarely interested in "GPIO #37"; instead, it wants "the GPIO
connected to the monitor's DDC line" or something to that effect.  For
well-defined systems where the use of GPIO lines never changes,
preprocessor definitions can be used to identify lines, but that approach
falls apart when the same GPIO can be put to different uses in different
systems.  As hardware gets more dynamic, with GPIOs possibly showing up
at any time, there is no easy way to know which GPIO goes where.  It can be
easy to get the wrong one by mistake.
<p>
As a result, platform and driver developers have come up with various ways
to locate GPIOs of interest.  Even your editor once submitted <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/10/10/162">a patch adding a
<tt>gpio_lookup()</tt> function</a> to the GPIO API, but that patch didn't
pass muster and was eventually dropped in favor of a driver-specific
solution.  So the number-based API has remained — until now.

<p>
Alexandre Courbot's <a href="/Articles/531848/">descriptor-based GPIO
interface</a> seeks to change the situation by introducing a new <tt>struct
gpio_desc&nbsp;*</tt> pointer type.  GPIO lines would be represented by one
of these pointers; what lives behind the pointer would be hidden from GPIO
users, though.  Internally, gpiolib (the implementation of the GPIO API
used by most architectures) is refactored to use descriptors rather
than numbers, and a new set of functions is presented to users.  These
functions will look familiar to users of the current GPIO API:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/gpio/consumer.h&gt;

    int gpiod_direction_input(struct gpio_desc *desc);
    int gpiod_direction_output(struct gpio_desc *desc, int value);
    int gpiod_get_value(struct gpio_desc *desc);
    void gpiod_set_value(struct gpio_desc *desc, int value);
    int gpiod_to_irq(struct gpio_desc *desc);
    int gpiod_export(struct gpio_desc *desc, bool direction_may_change);
    int gpiod_export_link(struct device *dev, const char *name,
			  struct gpio_desc *desc);
    void gpiod_unexport(struct gpio_desc *desc);
</pre>

<p>
In short: the <tt>gpio_</tt> prefix on the existing GPIO functions has been
changed to <tt>gpiod_</tt> and the integer GPIO number argument is now a
<tt>struct gpio_desc&nbsp;*</tt>.  There is also a new include file for the
new functions; otherwise the interfaces are identical.
The existing, integer-based API still exists, but it has been reimplemented
as a layer on top of the descriptor-based API shown here.
<p>
What is missing from the above list, though, is any way of obtaining a
descriptor for a GPIO line in the first place.  One way to do that is to
get the descriptor from the traditional GPIO number:
<p>
<pre>
    struct gpio_desc *gpio_to_desc(unsigned gpio);
</pre>
<p>
There is also a <tt>desc_to_gpio()</tt> for going in the opposite
direction.  Using this function makes it easy to transition existing code
over to the new API.  Obtaining a descriptor in this manner will ensure that no code
accesses a GPIO without having first properly obtained a descriptor for
it, but it would be better to do away with the numbers altogether in favor
of a more robust way of looking up GPIOs.  The patch set adds this
functionality in this form:
<p>
<pre>
    struct gpio_desc *gpiod_get(struct device *dev, const char *name);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>dev</tt> should be the device providing the GPIO line, and "name"
describes that line.  The <tt>dev</tt> pointer is needed to disambiguate
the name, and because code accessing a GPIO line should know which device
it is working through in any case.  So, for example, a video acquisition
bridge device may need access to GPIO lines with names like "sensor-power",
"sensor-reset", "sensor-i2c-clock" and "sensor-i2c-data".  The driver could
then request those lines by name with <tt>gpiod_get()</tt> without ever
having to be concerned with numbers.
<p>
Needless to say, there is a <tt>gpiod_put()</tt> for releasing access to a
GPIO line.
<p>
The actual association of names with GPIO lines can be done by the driver
that implements those lines, if the names are static and known.  In many
cases, though, the routing of GPIO lines will have been done by whoever
designed a specific system-on-chip or board; there is no way for the driver
author to know ahead of time how a specific system may be wired.  In this
case, the names of the GPIO lines will most likely be specified in the
device tree, or, if all else fails, in a platform data structure.
<p>
The response to this interface is generally positive; it seems almost
certain that it will be merged in the near future.  The biggest remaining
concern, perhaps, is that the descriptor interface is implemented entirely
within the gpiolib layer.  Most architectures use gpiolib to implement the
GPIO interface, but it is not mandatory; in some cases, the <tt>gpio_*</tt>
functions are implemented as macros that access the device registers
directly.  Such an implementation is probably more efficient, but GPIO is
not usually a performance-critical part of the system.  So there may be
pressure for all architectures to move to gpiolib; that, in turn, would
facilitate the eventual removal of the number-based API entirely.
<p>
<h4>Block GPIO</h4>
<p>
The GPIO interface as described so far is focused on the management of
individual GPIO lines.  But GPIOs are often used together as a group.  As a
simple example, consider a pair of GPIOs used as an I2C bus; one line
handles data, the other the clock.  A bit-banging driver can manage those
two lines together to communicate with connected I2C devices; the kernel
contains a driver in <tt>drivers/i2c/busses/i2-gpio.c</tt> for just this
purpose.
<p>
Most of the time, managing GPIOs individually, even when they are used as a
group, works fine.  Computers are quite fast relative to the timing
requirements of most of the serial communications protocols that are
subject to implementation with GPIO.  But there are exceptions, especially
when the hardware implementing the GPIO lines themselves is slow; that can
make it 
hard to change multiple lines in a simultaneous manner.  But, sometimes, the
hardware <i>can</i> change lines simultaneously if properly asked; often
the lines are represented by bits in the same device register and can all
be changed together with a single I/O memory write operation.
<p>
Roland Stigge's <a href="/Articles/533557/">block GPIO patch set</a> is an
attempt to make that functionality available in the kernel.  Code that
needs to manipulate multiple GPIOs as a group would start by associating
them in a single block with:
<p>
<pre>
    struct gpio_block *gpio_block_create(unsigned int *gpios, size_t size,
				     	 const char *name);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>gpios</tt> points to an array of <tt>size</tt> GPIO numbers which are
to be grouped into a block; the given <tt>name</tt> can be used to work
with the block from user space.  The GPIOs should have already been
requested with <tt>gpio_request()</tt>; they also need to have their
direction set individually.  It's worth noting that the GPIOs need not be
located on the same hardware; if they are spread out, or if the underlying
driver does not implement the internal block API, the block GPIO
interface will just access those lines individually as is done now.
<p>
Manipulation of GPIO blocks is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long gpio_block_get(struct gpio_block *block, unsigned long mask);
    void gpio_block_set(struct gpio_block *block, unsigned long mask,
		    	unsigned long values);
</pre>
<p>
For both functions, <tt>block</tt> is a GPIO block created as described
above, and <tt>mask</tt> is a bitmask specifying which GPIOs in the block
are to be acted upon; each bit in <tt>mask</tt> enables the corresponding
GPIO in the array passed to <tt>gpio_block_create()</tt>.
This API implies that the number of bits in a
<tt>long</tt> forces an upper bound on number of lines grouped into a GPIO
block; that seems unlikely to be a problem in real-world use.
<tt>gpio_block_get()</tt> will read the specified lines, 
simultaneously if possible, and return a bitmask with the result.  The
lines in a GPIO block can be set as a unit with <tt>gpio_block_set()</tt>. 
<p>
A GPIO block is released with:
<p>
<pre>
    void gpio_block_free(struct gpio_block *block);
</pre>
<p>
There is also a pair of registration functions:
<p>
<pre>
    int gpio_block_register(struct gpio_block *block);
    void gpio_block_unregister(struct gpio_block *block);
</pre>
<p>
Registering a GPIO block makes it available to user space.  There is a
sysfs interface that can be used to query and set the GPIOs in a block.
Interestingly, registration also creates a device node (using the name
provided to <tt>gpio_block_create()</tt>); reading from that device returns
the current state of the GPIOs in the block, while writing it will set the
GPIOs accordingly.  There is an <tt>ioctl()</tt> operation (which,
strangely, uses zero as the command number) to set the mask to be used with
read and write operations.
<p>
This patch set has not generated as much discussion as the descriptor-based
API patches (it is also obviously not yet integrated with the descriptor
API).  Most likely, relatively few developers have felt the need for a
block-based API.  That said, there are cases when it is likely to be
useful, and there appears to be no opposition, so this API can eventually
be expected to be merged as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

When userspace attempts to bit-bang multiple lines at the same time, you have the added problem that the userspace app may be preempted (potentially for a significant period of time), and this makes reliable operation much harder.<br>
<p>
It also means that the reliability degrades significantly as the load goes up. This will mean that it may never fail when the developer is testing it, but in teh real-world with higher load (and much longer operational periods) failures are almost guaranteed to take place.<br>
<p>
If you try to group together GPIO lines that are on different hardware, you aren't going to be perfectly reliable, but in most cases, the GPIO lines really are grouped on the hardware level, non-uncommonly, to the point where some layer is reading the state of a bank of lines, modifying it based on what's requested, and writing the new state out to all the lines at once.<br>
<p>
<p>
P.S. has anyone made a shim layer to allow you to use a parallel port as a set of GPIO lines?<br>

The timing and preemption problem is why I used SCHED_FIFO when I wrote a user-space front-panel LCD driver for an embedded system, long ago.<br>
<p>
The program runs SCHED_OTHER as normal, then escalates into SCHED_FIFO at prio 95 (something like that) to program the data ports, then falls back.<br>
<p>
I know that kernel interrupts and similar things may interfere but it was never a problem in practice. The LCD's timing requirements were not overly strict, just that you couldn't go away and ignore it for tens of milliseconds.<br>

Thanks Jon, excellent overview.<br>
<p>
I have (as GPIO co-maintainer) raised my concerns about the new grouped GPIO sysfs API, and left it for Grant to decide upon. I can live with it, but I'm not overly happy with this ABI/API having to be perpetually supported.<br>
<p>
My main concern is about use cases and I really haven't seen anybody step up and say: "I use this for X, Y, and Z". If that X, Y and Z is a fan on a laptop, a LED and some CD tray opener then yeah OK. But that does not seem to be the case, as the entire basis for its existence is that it be time-critical.<br>
<p>
For example, and related to the concerns that dlang raise above: what if these GPIO lines are controlling the servo motor of some robot, a dialysis machine or a fighter jet?<br>
<p>
I have hear RUMORS about this kind of use cases. That people will stick a process in userspace which is basically dealing with automatic control somekindof. And it's time critical, so the system is basically just running this one process, and it is elevated to real-time priority, so starvation etc should not occur.<br>
<p>
If you have the new SCHED_DEADLINE you could maybe do things like this (obviously this is done from userspace):<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJSWvC-QnjI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJSWvC-QnjI</a><br>
<p>
I don't know if this kind of things are what we're designing for with our sysfs interface, and I feel slightly inconvenient not knowing. Please use the comment field here to tell us all about your plans for userspace GPIO.<br>

I think dlang's post above was not pointing out concerns with the grouped/block interface, but instead pointing out how it solves real problems.<br>
<p>
There are lots of cases where you want things to happen simultaneously, but they're not time critical.  For example, let's say you drive an RGB LED on a cell phone with three GPIOs.  If it's currently yellow (R+G) and you want to change it to blue (B), you want to turn off two GPIOs and set one GPIO as a single operation.  It's okay if the entire action is delayed by 250ms, but it's not okay to change one bit, then have a delay, then change the other two bits, because then you'll have a visibly long period with an unexpected third color.<br>

if you are using the GPIOs to control a stepper motor directly, you can accept delay in making changes, but you _really_ want to have all the changes happen at the same time.<br>
<p>
There is also the chance that changing multiple bits at once is much easier than changing one bit at a time.<br>
<p>
If you were to use a parallel printer port as a GPIO (it has 8 outputs and 3 inputs IIRC), it's much easier to change all 8 bits at once than to change one bit at a time.<br>
<p>
The only thing I find questionable with the concept is that it allows grouping GPIO lines that do not have any underlying connection, but that doesn't make things any worse than they are now (other than possibly fooling the programmer into thinking they are better than they are now), and the improvements in the code of things using GPIO lines can be significant.<br>
<p>
one place this would make a huge amount of sense from a software point of view is if you are connected to a small LCD display through a parallel interface (very common for 16 character x 2 line displays for example).<br>
<p>
with this interface, you can do<br>
<p>
nibble = *c &amp; 0x0F;<br>
output(nibble);<br>
toggle(clock);<br>
nibble = *c++ &lt;&lt;4 &amp; 0x0F;<br>
output(nibble);<br>
toggle(clock);<br>
<p>
it would be much more work if you had to set each line independently.<br>

Thanks a lot for good commentary above.<br>
<p>
One issue raised by Alan Cox concerns security, see this post:<br>
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=135489945103388&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=135489945103388&amp;...</a><br>
<p>
How are people feeling about this? I for one worry that we implement security problems that will be hell to fix further down the road.<br>

I wonder, have the SELinux people commented on the security aspects?<br>

[BTW: the server behind the marc.info link seems to serve a page with missing &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags at the front]<br>

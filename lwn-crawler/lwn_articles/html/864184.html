One of the fundamental invariants of computing is that, regardless of how
much memory is installed in a system, it is never enough.  This is
especially true of systems with tight performance constraints, where every
page of memory is allocated and in use, making it difficult to find
more when it is badly needed.  One way to make more memory
available is to kill one or more processes, freeing their resources for
other users.  But that often does not work as quickly or reliably as users
would like.  In an attempt to improve the situation, Suren Baghdasaryan has
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210723011436.60960-1-surenb@google.com/">proposed</a>
the addition of a system call named <tt>process_mrelease()</tt>.
<p>
Systems running mixed workloads, where some tasks are more important than
others, are not uncommon.  If the system is being run near its maximum
capacity, the relatively unimportant tasks may end up using memory that is
needed by the more important work, at which point it might be better if the
unimportant processes went away.  Such systems often run process managers
that will kill off the low-priority processes in these situations; perhaps
the most widespread example of this pattern is Android, which will kill
background apps if the available memory is insufficient for whatever is
running in the foreground.  Cloud-computing systems will also kill
low-priority, best-effort workloads if their memory is needed by more
important work.
<p>
Killing a process should, in principle, make its memory immediately
available for other users.  In the real world, though, things are not so
simple.  The killed process is, itself, responsible for cleaning up and
freeing its resources, a task that is carried out in kernel context.  If,
however, the killed process finds itself blocked in an uninterruptible
sleep, that 
cleanup work could be delayed indefinitely.  There are other factors that
can slow down the freeing of memory, including how busy the relevant CPU is
and whether that CPU is running in a slow, low-power state.  
<p>
When this happens, the system has paid the cost of killing the process
(which was presumably doing something useful) without receiving the
benefits from that action.  Unfortunately, those benefits tend to be needed
urgently; the system would not be killing processes otherwise.  Delays in
process cleanup can have immediate and visible 
effects on the higher-priority workloads; these can include jerky response
on a handset or a delay in the delivery of a cat video to an impatient viewer.

<p>
This problem was encountered years ago in the context of the system's
out-of-memory (OOM) killer, which is the kernel's last-resort response when
memory runs out.  Back in 2015, the <a
href="/Articles/668126/#reaper">development 
of the OOM reaper</a> addressed this problem by taking the memory cleanup
work out of the dying process's hands and making it the responsibility of a
separate kernel thread.  That made OOM killing significantly more robust,
with the ability to free memory quickly even if the chosen process is not
able to exit immediately.
<p>
That work did not address one other unfortunate characteristic of the OOM
killer, though: its opinion of what is the least important process on the
system tends to differ from that of the system's users.  Invoking the OOM
killer may allow the system as a whole to continue functioning, but the
user whose window-system server was just killed may be forgiven for not
being fully enthusiastic in their celebration of that feat.
<p>
For this reason, systems developers have tended to take the business of
killing processes to rob them of their memory into their own hands.  An
out-of-memory handler running in user space can take more proactive steps
to prevent the system from going into the OOM state to begin with, and it
probably has a better idea of which processes will cause the least pain
should they encounter an untimely demise.  The <a
href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd">oomd daemon</a> released
by Facebook is one example of this kind of utility; there are others as
well.
<p>
User-space OOM killers, though, are not in the same position as the
kernel's OOM killer; they must rely on the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html"><tt>kill()</tt></a>
system call (or, more recently, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_send_signal.2.html"><tt>pidfd_send_signal()</tt></a>)
to implement the sharp end of their memory-freeing decisions.  Killing a
process that way does not bring the OOM reaper into play, so user-space
daemons are back in the situation of having to wait for the targeted
processes to release their own resources.
<p>
Baghdasaryan's answer to this problem is a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int process_mrelease(int pidfd, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>pidfd</tt> argument is a <a href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd</a>
identifying the process of interest; that process must be exiting
(presumably as the result of a previous <tt>kill()</tt> operation) when the
call is made.  The <tt>flags</tt> argument must be zero for now.  This call
will have the same effect as setting the OOM reaper on the indicated
process, stripping away as much of its memory as possible.
<p>
One of the reasons behind the creation of a separate call for this work is
to give the system a context in which to do it.  The task of going through
the process's address space and freeing up all that memory will be done by
the process that calls <tt>process_mrelease()</tt>, which may or may not be
the process that killed the target in the first place.  The kernel can then
do this work with the priority of the calling process, and with its CPU
assignments, allowing the cleanup work to be contained where it will not
interfere with the (remaining) system workload.
<p>
An alternative that was discussed with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190411014353.113252-1-surenb@google.com/">an
earlier attempt to solve this problem</a> was to just unconditionally reap
the memory of a process when it is killed, without requiring a separate
system call to make that happen.  In that case, though, the work would be
done in the context of the process sending the signal, which might not be
welcome.  A process that kills a lot of other ones — a <tt>killall</tt>
command, for example — could be significantly slowed if that policy were to
be adopted.  Adding a separate system call gives user space more control
over when and how that work is done.
<p>
In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210623192822.3072029-1-surenb@google.com/">the
previous posting</a> of this work, the main topic of discussion was the
name of the system call itself — <tt>process_reap()</tt> at that time.
That is a reasonably clear sign that the more significant issues have been
addressed and that the work may be about ready to move forward.  The
number of callers of <tt>process_mrelease()</tt> is likely to be small, but
it seems there will be some situations where it will be a useful tool to
have.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This doesn&#x27;t seem like it needs a completely separate syscall. pidfd_send_signal takes flags, and a &quot;reap process memory immediately&quot; flag seems like it would fit well there.<br>

If you want process A to do the killing, and process B to do the reaping, then you need a new syscall regardless.<br>
<p>
(Why have two? To improve throughput. A can spend all its CPU cycles on identifying useful things to kill, and B can spend its CPU cycles on actual reaping. You can then adjust the relative priorities of those two tasks independently of each other with the usual process-management techniques.)<br>

Interesting point! Technically process B (or thread B) could do the kill as well after A picked out a target, but it does make sense to have a high-priority process do the kill and a lower-priority (but still higher-priority-than-normal) process do the reclamation.<br>

<p>
In one of the first iterations this has been a flag to pidfd_send_signal() but I really disliked it. I get why it feels appealing but how memory is released has nothing to do with signaling imho. It&#x27;s better suited as a separate API where it can also be extended in the future.<br>

<p>
As I&#x27;ve said before on LKML, I like this general pattern. Too often in kernel-land we make kernel threads that performs some action on *behalf* of user code, but without giving user code control over the number or characteristics of those kernel threads. (I&#x27;m looking at you, io_uring.) Userspace should be in control of the kernel threads doing work on its behalf, and the easiest and best way of giving userspace this control is to make userspace provide the threads to do the kernel work. After all: every userspace thread *is* a kernel thread too!<br>

Ehhhhh, I would usually use the term kernel thread to mean dedicated to the kernel and does not (with rare exceptions) ever run in user space.<br>
<p>
I get the point being made above, though - user threads can run in kernel context (obviously :)) and so they can do some of the work directly.<br>

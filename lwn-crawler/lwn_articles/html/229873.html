<h1>Too many threads</h1>

Part of the fun of working with truly large machines is that one gets to
discover new scalability surprises before anybody else.  So the SGI folks
often have more fun than many of the rest of us.  Their latest discovery
has to do with the number of kernel threads which, on a 4096-processor
system, leads to some interesting kernel behavior.
<p>
To begin, they found out that they could not even boot a kernel with the
default configuration.  Linux systems normally have a limit of 32768 active
processes at any given time.  Anybody who has run "ps" will have noted that
kernel threads are taking up an increasing number of those slots; your
editor's single-processor desktop is running 39 of them.  In fact, there
are now enough kernel threads on a 
typical system that they will fill that entire space - and more - on a
4096-CPU machine.  This problem is relatively easy to take care of by
raising the limit on the number of processes.  But it gets more interesting
from there.
<p>

The init process is the parent of last resort for every other process on
the system, including kernel threads.  So, on a big system, init has a
<i>lot</i> of child processes.  These children live on a big linked list;
that list must be searched by various functions, including the variants of
<tt>wait()</tt>.  If the process being searched for is toward the end of
the list, that search can take a long time.  Since (1)&nbsp;most kernel
threads are long-lived, and (2)&nbsp;new processes are put at the end of
the list, chances are that a search will, indeed, be looking for a process
at the end.
<p>

Then, for the ultimate in fun, load a module into the kernel.  The module
loading process calls <tt>stop_machine_run()</tt> when the new module is
being linked in; this function creates a high-priority kernel thread for
each processor on the system.  That thread will grab its assigned CPU and
simply sit there until told to exit; while all CPUs are locked up in this
way the linking process can be performed.  Calling a function like
<tt>stop_machine_run()</tt> is a somewhat antisocial act in the best of
times.  But, in the 4096-processor system, <tt>stop_machine_run()</tt> will
create 4096 threads, each of which goes on the end of init's child list,
and each of which must be searched for when the time comes to clean it up.
The result is a system which simply stops for an extended period of time.
<p>

One could argue that people with systems that large simply should not load
modules, but there is a possibility of pushback from the user community.
So other solutions need to be found.  Robin Holt's <a
href="/Articles/229876/">problem report</a> included a simple patch which
moves exiting processes to the beginning of the child list.  This change
solves the immediate problem by making searches for those children find
them without having to iterate through all of the long-lived processes
which are not going anywhere.
<p>

Linus had <a href="/Articles/229877/">a couple of alternatives</a>.  One
was to create a separate list for zombie processes, eliminating that search
altogether.  Another was to stop making kernel threads be children of the
init process since they have little to do with user space in any case.
But some developers feel that the real solution might be to start cutting
back on the number of kernel threads.  
<p>

The biggest culprit for kernel thread creation will certainly be
workqueues, which, by default, create one thread for every CPU on the
system.  There are situations which can benefit from multiple threads and
CPU locality, but there are undoubtedly many places where all of those
threads are not needed.  Cleaning them up would help to solve some of the
scalability issues; as an added bonus it would remove some of the clutter
from ps listings.
<p>

In many cases, a workqueue may not be necessary at all.  Instead, kernel
subsystems could just use the "generic" keventd workqueue (which runs as the
<tt>events/</tt>n threads).  There are some issues with using
keventd, including indeterminate latency and a small possibility
of deadlocks, but, for many situations, it may work well enough.  

<p> 

In other cases, using a thread makes sense.  Tasks involving long delays
are one example; running a function with multi-second delays in
<tt>keventd</tt> is considered impolite.  Work requiring complicated
context also benefits from its own thread.  But, in a number of cases,
those threads need not be created until there is actually some work to be
done.  A quick ps run on most systems will show threads related to error
handling, asynchronous I/O, bluetooth, and more.  In the current scheme,
they are created at boot (or module load) time and many of them may never
do any real work before the system shuts down.  Thread creation is cheap,
so many of these threads could be created on demand when they are needed.
<p>

There are probably some real improvements to be made in this area; all
that's needed is somebody with the time and motivation to do the work.  In
the mean time, those of you with 4096-way systems may need to apply a patch
or two.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      A single root sort-of makes sense. It keeps things simple, for a start. 
Not too keen on linked lists for large searches, though - that gets ugly, 
fast, as has been noted - unless they're kept sorted by inserting into 
the list rather than appending.
<p>
Nonlinear structures are faster to search and to add to, which would 
obviously help, but eat more memory. If this was a solution people would 
consider, then it would need to be possible to revert to linear 
structures on embedded and other very compact systems.
<p>
Or you could have the capacity to have multiple families attached to a 
process. Then, all processes would have init as their common parent, but 
by different lists. So long as you could guarantee picking the right list 
each time, every time, and so long as the lists were crudely balanced, 
you reduce the time overheads without adding significant data overheads.
<p>
Or you could say "screw it", put the thread handling code in an ASIC 
chip, sell it to all the Linux users out there, and retire on some exotic 
island.

this is a serious concern, since since some few years ago we find 8-core computers on sale (like Apple MacPro) - and soon we surelly may have computers in our home (or even our portable ones) with these 4096 cores (or close to that, or on the way)<br>

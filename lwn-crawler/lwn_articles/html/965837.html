           </div>
While a programming error in the kernel may be subject to direct
exploitation, usually a more roundabout approach is required to take
advantage of a security bug.  One popular approach for those wishing to
take advantage of vulnerabilities  is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">heap spraying</a>, and
it has often been employed to compromise the kernel.  In the future,
though, heap-spraying attacks may be a bit harder to pull off, thanks to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240305100933.it.923-kees@kernel.org/">the
"dedicated bucket allocator"</a> proposed by Kees Cook.
<p>
Consider, for example, a use-after-free bug of the type that is,
unfortunately, common in programs written in languages like&nbsp;C.  Memory
that is freed can be allocated to another user and overwritten; at that
point, the code that freed the memory prematurely is likely to find an
unpleasant surprise.  The surprise will become even less endearing, though,
if an attacker is able to control the data that is written into the freed
memory.  Often, that is all that is needed to turn a use-after-free bug
into a full kernel compromise.
<p>
It is, of course, difficult for an attacker to get their hands on precisely
the chunk of memory that is being mishandled in the kernel.  When precision
is not possible, sometimes brute force will do.  Heap spraying involves
allocating as many chunks of memory as possible, and writing the crafted
data into each, in the hope of happening upon the right one.  Given the way
that the kernel's slab allocator works, the chances of succeeding
are higher than one might expect.
<p>
The kernel has a variety of ways to allocate memory but, much of the time,
a simple call to <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is used; this is especially true if the
size of the memory to be allocated is not known ahead of time.  Within the
allocator, the requested memory size is rounded up to the nearest "bucket"
size, and the requested chunk is allocated from the associated bucket.
Those sizes are (mostly, but not exclusively) powers of two, so any
allocation request between 33 and 64&nbsp;bytes, for example, will be
satisfied from the 64-byte bucket.
<p>
If an attacker has determined that a given structure, allocated with
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>, is used after being freed, they can attempt a
heap-spraying attack by forcing the kernel to allocate (and write) a large
number of objects from the same bucket.  As it turns out, there are
ways in which an attacker can get the kernel to do just that.
<p>
The solution to this kind of problem (beyond fixing every use-after-free
bug, of course) is to keep the allocation pools separate.  If every
allocation comes from its own heap, it cannot be used to spray somebody
else's heap.  Unfortunately, the current design exists for a reason; using
common buckets for allocations across the kernel significantly increases
allocation efficiency and memory utilization.  So that is unlikely to
change.
<p>
During the 6.6 development cycle, an effort to improve the kernel's
resistance to heap spraying, in the form of the <a
href="/Articles/938637/"><tt>kmalloc()</tt> randomness patches</a>, was
merged.  This work split each of the <tt>kmalloc()</tt> buckets
16&nbsp;ways and caused the allocator to pick a random bucket (based on the
request call site) to satisfy
each request, with the result that a heap-spraying attack has a high chance
of hitting the wrong bucket.  It is a way of partially separating
allocations without giving up entirely on a common set of heaps.
Randomness hardens the kernel to an extent, but it is a probabilistic
defense that will surely fail at times.
<p>
The key point behind Cook's approach is that it is not necessary to
separate all allocations into their own heaps; if the kernel could ensure
that any <i>user-controllable</i> allocation is satisfied from a different
pool than anything else, heap spraying would be much harder to implement.
To get there, a new API must be created for kernel subsystems that perform
user-controllable allocations; that is what the patch series does.
<p>
The first step for such a subsystem is to create its own heap for
variable-size allocations with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    kmem_buckets *kmem_buckets_create(const char *name, unsigned int align,
			  	      slab_flags_t flags,
			  	      unsigned int useroffset,
				      unsigned int usersize,
			  	      void (*ctor)(void *));
</pre>
<p>
This call is similar to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.8.1/source/mm/slab_common.c#L361"><tt>kmem_cache_create()</tt></a>,
which creates a heap for fixed-size allocations.  The name of the heap
(which can be used for debugging) is given by <tt>name</tt>, and
<tt>align</tt> describes the required alignment for objects allocated
there.  Flags for the slab allocator are given in <tt>flags</tt>.  The
<tt>useroffset</tt> and <tt>usersize</tt> parameters describe the portion
of an object that might be copied to or from user space (information that
is used by the kernel's <a href="/Articles/727322/">user-space copying
hardening</a> mechanism), and <tt>ctor()</tt> is an optional constructor
for allocated objects.  The return value is a pointer to a
<tt>kmem_buckets</tt> object that can be used for future allocations.
<p>
Once that call succeeds, objects can be allocated with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *kmem_buckets_alloc(kmem_buckets *b, size_t size, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>b</tt> is the pointer returned by <tt>kmem_buckets_create()</tt>,
<tt>size</tt> is the size of the allocation, and <tt>flags</tt> is the
usual <a href="/Articles/920891/">GFP flags</a>; a pointer to the allocated
memory is returned.  A normal <tt>kfree()</tt> call can be used to free
objects when they are (truly) no longer needed.  There is also a
<tt>kmem_buckets_valloc()</tt> that can fall back to <tt>vmalloc()</tt> if
need be.
<p>
The other part of the puzzle is to use this new allocator in the right
places.  Seemingly, the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/msgsnd.3p.html"><tt>msgsnd()</tt></a>
system call is a favorite tool for heap-spraying attacks, since the kernel
implements it by allocating a structure to contain the message to be sent
(the size and contents of which are controlled by user space).  Cook's
series includes <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240305101026.694758-8-keescook@chromium.org/">a
patch</a> causing <tt>msgsnd()</tt> to use the new bucket allocator,
separating its allocations from all others and removing its utility in this
kind of attack.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240305101026.694758-9-keescook@chromium.org/">Another
patch</a> switches the internal <tt>memdup_user()</tt> and
<tt>vmemdup_user()</tt> functions, which are used to copy data from user
space into the kernel.  Many of the call sites for those functions will
give user space some control over allocation sizes, so isolating them could
prevent a lot of problems.
<p>
While the proposed changes are relatively small, they could have an
oversized impact on kernel security.  Separating off user-controllable
allocations in this way can block many of the exploits that have succeeded
against the kernel in the past.  Creating a kernel that is free of
memory-safety bugs does not seem like a feasible goal in the near future,
but making one where such bugs are harder to exploit is possible.  Chances
are that this patch series, in some form, will show up in the mainline
before too long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmmm it seems like it might be both more performant AND less work overall to make the bucket selection be a function of the call stack. Say a hash function based of the return IP of frames 3-6 (can't include frame zero because that would always be the same). That would result in a given call site always going to the same bucket first, while also (given a good hash) spreading out which bucket other call sites got to. <br>

      That is essentially what the randomization patches do, tossing in a random nonce so that each boot is different.  It's an improvement, but it won't eliminate situatoins where the attacker is able to target the same bucket.

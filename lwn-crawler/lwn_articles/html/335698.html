<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 3, 2009</br>
           </div>
<p>
Last week's Security page <a href="/Articles/334067/">looked</a> at some
recently proposed patches that would "sanitize" kernel memory by clearing
it as it was freed.  At that time, a second version of the patches which
unconditionally cleared memory when freed&mdash;dependent on the
<tt>sanitize_mem</tt> boot parameter&mdash;was generally well received.
But, perhaps folks just had not yet had a chance to look. Over the
last week, multiple objections have been raised, which were mostly met with
belligerent responses from developer Larry Highsmith.  In many ways, this
is starting to look like yet another lesson in "how not to work with the
kernel community". 
</p>

<p>
The basic problem is that data can persist in memory long after that memory
is freed.  Sometimes that data contains passwords, cryptographic keys,
confidential documents, etc., but it is impossible for the kernel to know,
in the general case, which pages are sensitive.  By clearing memory when it
is deallocated, the lifetime of this potentially sensitive data can be
reduced.  A research <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/papers/shredding.html/">paper</a>
describes some experiments that showed memory values persisting for days
and even weeks on Linux systems.  A bug in the kernel that leaked memory
information could potentially leak these values to attackers.
</p>

<p>
So, Highsmith proposed adding a memory sanitization feature that has long
been a part of the patches applied to the kernel by the <a
href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/">PaX security project</a>.  There is
clearly a performance impact to clearing memory as it is reclaimed, but,
since memory is cleared as it is allocated (to avoid obvious information leaks),
the impact may not be as large as it seems at first glance.  As Arjan van
de Ven <a href="/Articles/335883/">points out</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
.. and if we zero on free, we don't need to zero on allocate.
While this is a little controversial, it does mean that at least part of
the cost is just time-shifted, which means it'll not be TOO bad
hopefully...
</div>
</p>

<p>
Peter Zijlstra is <a href="/Articles/335886/">concerned</a> about the cache
effects: "<q>zero on allocate has the advantage of cache hotness, we're
going to use the memory, why else allocate it. [...] zero on free only
causes extra cache evictions for no gain.</q>"   But van de Ven <a
href="/Articles/335889/">describes</a> how he sees the caches being
affected, concluding: "<q>Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing that
zero-on-free is better, I'm 
just trying to point out that the 'advantage' of zero-on-allocate isn't
nearly as big as people sometimes think it is...</q>"
</p>

<p>
But some, like Alan Cox, <a href="/Articles/335901/">think</a> the
performance impact is immaterial: "<q>If you need this kind of data wiping then the performance hit
is basically irrelevant, the security comes first.</q>"  Zijlstra
and others are concerned about the price that is paid by <i>all</i> kernel
users, even those who have not enabled <tt>sanitize_mem</tt>.  He <a
href="/Articles/335903/">notes</a> that the patches would add extra
function calls and branches even when the feature is not enabled.
Suggestions were made to benchmark the proposed code against the existing
implementation, but that is where the conversation started to go off the rails.
</p>

<p>
Highsmith obviously gets frustrated with the direction of the
discussion, but rather than stepping back, he lashes out.  There is
certainly some provocation in the thread, Zijlstra's "<q>Really, get a life, go fix real bugs. Don't make our kernel slower for
wanking rights.</q>" <a href="/Articles/335914/">comment</a> certainly
didn't help.  But Highsmith needs to recognize that he is the one trying to
get something added to the kernel, so the burden of "proof" is on him.
Instead, his condescending manner seems to indicate that he feels like he
is presenting the kernel community with a gift&mdash;one they are too
slow-witted to understand.
</p>

<p>
An important characteristic for kernel contributors is that they work well
with the rest of the community: answer questions, respond to code review
suggestions, etc.  When that doesn't happen, patches tend to be ignored,
regardless of their technical merit, and Highsmith seems headed down that
path.  When it was suggested that using <tt>kzfree()</tt> on specific
kernel allocations for sensitive data&mdash;which would clear the memory,
then free it&mdash;Highsmith <a href="/Articles/335932/">responded</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
That's hopeless, and kzfree is broken. Like I said in my earlier reply,
please test that yourself to see the results. Whoever wrote that ignored
how SLAB/SLUB work and if kzfree had been used somewhere in the kernel
before, it should have been noticed [a] long time ago.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Since Highsmith was responding to SLAB maintainer Pekka Enberg's
suggestion, that response&mdash;even if true&mdash;probably wasn't the right
approach.  Enberg and others <a href="/Articles/335938/">asked</a> specifically about the problems in
<tt>kzfree()</tt>, but the <a href="/Articles/335940/">response</a> from
Highsmith was a combination of condescension and vagueness.  As soon as
Enberg and Ingo Molnar tried to pin down where those problems are, Highsmith
went off on a <a href="/Articles/335944/">rant</a> about the SLOB memory
allocator. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, Molnar has <a href="/Articles/335959/">pointed out</a> that
some of the same sensitive values can have long lifetimes on the kernel
stack:
<div class="BigQuote">
Long-lived tasks that touched any crypto path (or other sensitive 
data in the kernel) and leaked it to the kernel stack can possibly 
keep sensitive information there indefinitely (especially if that 
information got there in an accidentally deep stack context) - up 
until the task exits. That information will outlive the freeing and 
sanitizing of the original sensitive data.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Rather than recognize this as an additional area that needs addressing,
Highsmith just <a href="/Articles/335963/">continues</a> his tirade: 
<div class="BigQuote">
But you and the other cabal of vagueness have only sent mostly useless
comments, outright uncivil responses, obvious misdirection attempts,
unfounded critics, etc. I haven't seen more fallacies put together since
the last time I read an unreleased film script by Jerry Lewis.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Overall, the idea of clearing memory as it is freed based on a boot time
flag is reasonable.  Several kernel hackers, including Cox and Rik van
Riel, have expressed interest in seeing the feature added.  With some
effort, it would seem that the performance cost for the disabled case could
be reduced to an acceptable level, but if the main proponent is spending
his time fighting and flaming, it seems unlikely that it will ever get
merged. 
</p>

<p>
A newer set of patches, which just use <tt>kzfree()</tt> in specific
sensitive places (<a href="/Articles/335945/">tty buffer management</a>, <a
href="/Articles/335946/">802.11 key handling</a>, and <a
href="/Articles/335947/">the crypto API</a>) were also proposed by Highsmith,
but Linus Torvalds was not particularly <a
href="/Articles/335948/">impressed</a>.  There was no need to use
<tt>kzfree()</tt> there, a simple <tt>memset()</tt> was sufficient.
Torvalds was not necessarily a believer in the need for the patches, nor
for how Highsmith responded to review: 
<div class="BigQuote">
but quite frankly, I'm not
convinced about these patches at all. 
</p>
I'm also not in the least convinced about how you just dismiss everybodys 
concerns.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There were some additional technical complaints about the patches as
well, particularly the use of <tt>kzfree()</tt> <i>everywhere</i> in the crypto
API patch.  Crypto API maintainer Herbert Xu <a
href="/Articles/335951/">noted</a>: "<q>The zeroing of metadata is
gratuitous.</q>"   Overall, they had the look of being created
grudgingly&mdash;as if it were a favor to do so.
</p>

<p>
Where things go from here is unclear.  Highsmith seemed to possibly be
signing off in his <a href="/Articles/335954/">reply</a> to Torvalds:
"<q>The next time a kernel vulnerability appears that is remotely
related to 
some of the venues of attack I've commented, it will be useful to be
able to refer to these responses.</q>"   There is some justification for
Highsmith's frustration, but he needs to see that it isn't going to do him
(or the kernel) any good.
</p>

<p>
Kernel contributors, especially new ones, need to recognize that the community
has folks that are at least as smart as they are.  In this case, some of
those developers may not have the security focus that Highsmith does, but
that doesn't reduce their understanding of the kernel, nor their interest
in seeing it have patches applied for better security.  It would be
unfortunate to see this feature, which could be very useful in some
environments, fall by the wayside.

Jake, in journalism, quoting only the most lurid phrases of a discussion has a name. And the media that normally does this are tabloids... LWN.net isn't supposed to be one. Right?<br>

In the end, your entire write-up is a quite shallow attempt at avoiding to describe what true technical issues were being brought up in that discussion, the reasoning behind some of the patches, the lack of intention to understand or listen to them by some of the kernel developers, and so forth.<br>

I am sorry you see it that way ... by my count, there were 11 quotes in the article, 4 of which (stretching it) could be considered 'lurid'.<br>

I was merely pointing out that your intention in this article is either not completely clear, or clearly not impartial. And none of both will help the kernel become more secure, you are just adding more to the 'political/social issues'.<br>
<p>
If you want to stir the dirty water in the cesspool, go ahead and do it, but don't put people's names on it which might be something borderline questionable, in both ethical and legal terms. That's your call, though.<br>
<p>
Regarding difficulty, I'm not sure what you mean. But if there's anything you don't understand about something, it's best to simply avoid publishing an article about it until you've documented yourself properly. Don't you think that's the mature and ethical thing to do?<br>

huh?  i don't follow this at all, sorry ... quoting people from their posts to linux-kernel is what we do around here ...<br>
<p>
if you think that only technical considerations are part of the kernel development process, you are fooling yourself ... perhaps i concentrated too much on the 'social/political' part of things, for me, it was a difficult balance to strike.<br>
<p>
i sense that you are one of the participants and feel i somehow misrepresented you?  if so, apologies for that as well ... but I don't see any 'ethical' (or 'maturity' for that matter) breach.<br>

Not us who are trying to conceal the facts, but you've already proved what you intended with this article and have been unsuccessful at it ;) Congratulations, gentleman!<br>

Zijlstra and others are concerned about the price that is paid by all kernel users, even those who have not enabled sanitize_mem. He notes that the patches would add extra function calls and branches even when the feature is not enabled.
</blockquote>

Jake, you might want to review that part of the article too (feel free to check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)). The entire SLAB/SLUB code has conditional branches and nobody ever opposed that, even though some of them could have been saved. And if they did, it would be still an anal retentive remark, since you are arguing 3 instructions more cause any noticeable or latency overhead in modern systems (or old ones at that, if you want to look at a museum). It's interesting you don't quote any of the responses to that, nor include links to the full threads of all the involved discussions. I guess the mistake wasn't intentional...

<blockquote>
There is clearly a performance impact to clearing memory as it is reclaimed, but, since memory is cleared as it is allocated (to avoid obvious information leaks), the impact may not be as large as it seems at first glance.
</blockquote>

The above phrasing seems quite misleading and imprecise. By reclaim you mean freeing or allocation-post-release? You've got it wrong about memory being cleared when allocated (and that it would prevent information leaks, just read the thread again skipping the bits you decided to quote here which don't add anything useful for readers to understand what's going on)... that was never done by any of the sanitization patches and they actually remove GFP_ZERO handling on allocation to avoid duplication of the clearing. 
<br /><br />
BTW, did you realize some of this made it to -mm?
<br /><br />
Maybe you were too busy reading the sensationalist and controversial bits and missed that one too, no problem again. The article would have been great if you had actually read the patches.

I have no idea if you're right or wrong on the technical points, but you really do come across as hostile and arrogant.  Maybe if you calmed down and responded clearly without any attacks (and no "but he started it") then you find that people would suddenly take you a lot more seriously.<br>

<p>Such condescending and hostile attitude is what much of this article is about.

<p>It doesn't really help anyone, it hampers fruitful discussion.

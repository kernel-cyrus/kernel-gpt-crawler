The swap subsystem is where anonymous pages (those containing program data
not backed by files in the filesystem) go when memory pressure forces them
out of RAM.  A widely held view says that swapping is almost always bad
news; by the time a Linux system gets to the point where it is swapping out
anonymous pages, the performance battle has already been lost.  So it is
not at all uncommon to see Linux systems configured with no swap space at
all.  Whether the relatively poor performance of swapping is a cause or an
effect of that attitude is a matter for debate.  What is becoming clearer,
though, is that the case for using swapping <a href="/Articles/690079/">is
getting stronger</a>, so there 
is value in making swapping faster.
<p>
Swapping is becoming more attractive as the performance of storage devices
— solid-state storage devices (SSDs) in particular — increases.  Not too
long ago, 
moving a page to or from a storage device was an incredibly slow operation,
taking several orders of magnitude more time than a direct memory access.
The advent of persistent-memory devices has changed that ratio, to the
point where storage speeds are approaching main-memory speeds.  At the same
time, the growth of cloud computing gives providers a stronger incentive to
overcommit the main memory on their systems.  If swapping can be made fast
enough, the performance penalty for overcommitting memory becomes
insignificant, leading to better utilization of the system as a whole.
<p>
As Tim Chen noted in a recently posted <a href="/Articles/704359/">patch
set</a>, the kernel currently imposes a significant overhead on page faults
that must retrieve a page from swap.  The patch set addresses that problem
by increasing the scalability of the swap subsystem in a few ways.
<p>
In current kernels, a swap device (a dedicated partition or a special file
within a filesystem) is represented by a <tt>swap_info_struct</tt>
structure.  Among the many fields of that structure is <tt>swap_map</tt>, a
pointer to a byte array, where each byte contains the reference count for a
page stored on the swap device.  The structure looks vaguely like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/swap_cluster.svg" alt="[Swap file data structures]"
class="photo" width=600> 
</blockquote>
<p>
Some of the swap code is quite old; a fair amount dates back to the
beginning of the Git era.  In the early days, the kernel would attempt to
concentrate swap-file usage toward the beginning of the device — the left
end of the <tt>swap_map</tt> array shown above.  When one is swapping to
rotating storage, this approach makes sense; keeping data in the swap
device together should minimize the amount of seeking required to access
it.  It works rather less well on solid-state devices, for a couple of
reasons: (1)&nbsp;there is no seek delay on such devices, and (2)&nbsp;the
wear-leveling requirements of SSDs are better met by spreading the traffic
across the device.
<p>
In an attempt to perform better on SSDs, the swap code was changed in 2013
for the 3.12 release.  When the swap subsystem knows that it is working
with an SSD, it divides the device into clusters, as shown below:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/swap_cluster1.svg" alt="[Swap file data structures]"
class="photo" width=600> 
</blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>percpu_cluster</tt> pointer points to a different cluster for each
CPU on the system.  With this arrangement, each CPU can allocate pages from
the swap device from within its own cluster, with the result that those
allocations are spread across the device.  In theory, this approach is also
more scalable, except that, in current kernels, much of the scalability
potential has not yet been achieved.
<p>
The problem, as is so often the case, has to do with locking.  CPUs
do not have exclusive access to any given cluster (even the one indicated
by <tt>percpu_cluster</tt>), so they must acquire the <tt>lock</tt>
spinlock in the <tt>swap_info_struct</tt> structure before any changes can
be made.  There are typically not many swap devices on any given system —
there is often only one — so, when swapping is heavy, that spinlock is
heavily contended.
<p>
Spinlock contention is not the path to high scalability; in this case, that
contention is not even necessary.  Each cluster is independent and can be
allocated from without touching the others, so there is no real need to
wait on a single global lock.  The first order of business in the patch
set is thus to add a new lock to each entry in the <tt>cluster_info</tt> array;
a single-bit lock is used to minimize the added memory consumption.  Now,
any given CPU can allocate pages from (or free pages into) its cluster
without contending with the others.
<p>
Even so, there is overhead in taking the lock, and there can be cache-line
contention when accessing the lock in other CPUs' clusters (as can often
happen when pages are freed, since nothing forces them to be conveniently
within the freeing CPU's current cluster).  To minimize that cost, the patch
set adds new interfaces to allocate and free swap pages in batches.  Once a
CPU has allocated a batch of swap pages, it can use them without even
taking the local cluster lock.  Freed swap pages are accumulated in a
separate cache and returned in batches.  Interestingly, freed pages are not
reused by the freeing CPU in the hope that freeing them all will help
minimize fragmentation of the swap space.
<p>
There is one other contention point that needs to be addressed.  Alongside
the <tt>swap_info_struct</tt> structure, the swap subsystem maintains an
<tt>address_space</tt> structure for each swap device.  This structure
contains the mapping between pages in memory and their corresponding
backing store on the swap device.  Changes in swap allocation require
updating the <a href="/Articles/175432/">radix tree</a> in the
<tt>address_space</tt> structure, and that radix tree is protected by
another lock. 
Since, once again, there is typically only one swap device in the system,
that is another global lock for all CPUs to contend for.
<p>
The solution in this case is a variant on the clustering approach.  The
<tt>address_space</tt> structure is replicated into many structures, one
for each 64MB of swap space.  If the swap area is sized at (say) 10GB, the
single <tt>address_space</tt> will be split 160 ways, each of which has its
own lock.  That clearly reduces the scope for contention for any individual
lock.  The patch also takes care to ensure that the initial allocation of
swap clusters puts each CPU into a separate <tt>address_space</tt>,
guaranteeing that there will be no contention at the outset (though, once
the system has been operating for a while, the swap patterns will become
effectively random).
<p>
According to Chen, current kernels add about 15µs of overhead to every page
fault that is satisfied by a read from a solid-state swap device.  That, he
says, is comparable to the amount of time it takes to actually read the
data from the device.  With the patches applied, that overhead drops to
4µs, a significant improvement.  There have been no definitive comments on
the patch set as of this writing, but it seems like the sort of improvement
that the swap subsystem needs to work well with contemporary storage devices.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The cluster lock doesn't help scalability of swap space allocation and freeing.  For swap space allocation and freeing, the global lock in swap_info_struct will still be used.  So we need swap space allocation and freeing batching to reduce its contention.  The cluster lock mainly helps operations like swap_duplicate(), swp_swapcount(), etc.<br>

Yes, the cluster lock cannot address the swap_info lock contention during swap slot allocation and freeing. The second part of the patch set creates a cache for swap slots allocated and swap slots returned.  So the allocation and free operation can be done in batches.  That helped to reduce contention on swap_info lock.<br>

<p>
The integrity measurement architecture (IMA) has been a part of Linux for
roughly a year now&mdash;it was merged for 2.6.30&mdash;and it can be used
to attest to the integrity of a running Linux system.  But IMA can be
subverted by "offline" attacks, where file data or metadata is changed out
from under IMA.  Mimi Zohar has proposed the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/393673/">extended
verification module</a> (EVM) patch set as a means to
protect against these offline attacks.
</p>

<p>
In its default configuration, IMA calculates hash values for executables,
files which are <tt>mmap()</tt>ed for execution, and files open for reading
by root.  That list of hashes is consulted each time those files are
accessed anew, so that unexpected changes can be detected.  In addition,
IMA can be 
used with the trusted platform module (TPM) hardware, which is present in
many systems,  to
sign a collection of these hash values in such a way that a remote system
can verify that only "trusted" code is running (remote attestation). 
</p>

<p>
But an attacker could modify the contents of the disk by accessing it
under another kernel or operating system.  That could potentially be
detected by the remote attestation, but cannot be detected by the system
itself.  EVM sets out to change that.
</p>

<p>
One of the additions that comes with the EVM patch set is the <a
href="/Articles/394362/">integrity appraisal extension</a>, which maintains
the file's integrity measurement (hash value) as an extended attribute (xattr) of a file.
The <tt>security.ima</tt> xattr is used to store the hash, which gets
compared to the calculated value each time the file is opened.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Articles/394364/">EVM itself</a> just calculates a hash over the extended attributes in the <tt>security</tt> namespace (e.g. <tt>security.ima</tt>, <tt>security.selinux</tt>, and
<tt>security.SMACK64</tt>), uses the TPM to sign it, and stores it as the
<tt>security.evm</tt> attribute on the file.  Currently, the key to be used
with the TPM signature gets loaded onto the root keyring by
<tt>readevmkey</tt>, 
which just 
prompts for a password at the console.  Because an attacker doesn't have
the key, an offline attack cannot correctly modify the EVM xattr when it
changes file data.  Securing the key is important, so future work will
entail using TPM 
sealed keys and encrypted symmetric keys so that the plaintext EVM key will
never be visible to user space.
</p>

<p>
With all of that in place, a system administrator can be sure that the code
running on the system is the same as that which was measured.  Presumably,
the initial measurement is done from a known good state.  After that, any
offline 
attack would need to either modify a file's contents, which would
cause the IMA comparison to fail, or modify its security xattrs, which
would cause the EVM comparison to fail.
</p>

<p>
These patches have been bouncing around in various forms for five years or
more; we first <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/160157/">looked</a> at EVM
in 2005.  The EVM patch describes some of the changes that EVM has
undergone along the way: "<q>EVM has gone
through a number of iterations, initially as an LSM module, subsequently
as a LIM [<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287790/">Linux integrity
module</a>] integrity provider, and now, when co-located with a security_ 
hook, embedded directly in the security_ hook, similar to IMA.</q>"
That evolution reflects both changes suggested in the review process as
well as a realization that, since Linux security modules (LSMs) don't <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/393008/">stack</a>, it would be impossible to
have both EVM and SELinux, say, in one kernel.  That led to adding IMA, and
now EVM, as calls out from the appropriate security hooks or VFS code.
</p>

<p>
For EVM, the hooks affected are <tt>security_inode_setxattr()</tt>,
<tt>security_inode_post_setxattr()</tt>, and
<tt>security_inode_removexattr()</tt>, each of which embeds a call to the
appropriate <tt>evm_*</tt> function.  The <tt>evm_inode_setxattr()</tt>
function protects the <tt>security.evm</tt> xattr from modification unless
the <tt>CAP_MAC_ADMIN</tt> capability is held.  The other two calls update
the EVM hash associated with a file when xattrs are changed.
</p>

<p>
The patches aren't too intrusive outside of the security subsystem, though
they do touch some other areas.  Two new generic VFS calls
(<tt>vfs_getxattr_alloc()</tt> and <tt>vfs_xattr_cmp()</tt>) were added to
simplify xattr handling.  Because various additional file attributes
(beyond just the security xattrs, like inode number, uid, mode, and so on)
are used in the EVM hash, changes to those need to cause a recalculation,
which necessitated changes <tt>fs/attr.c</tt>.  And so on.
</p>

<p>
There are few comments on this iteration of the EVM patches.  The idea has
been through several rounds of review over the years and the patches have
picked up an ACK 
from Serge E. Hallyn.  EVM closes
the offline attack hole in the protection that IMA provides and would
thus seem to make a 
good addition the mainline kernel.  For those who want to try it out now,
there are <a
href="http://linux-ima.sourceforge.net/#EVM">instructions</a> available on
the <a 
href="http://linux-ima.sourceforge.net/">Linux integrity subsystem</a> web page.
Unless major complaints appear, one would think that EVM might well be a
candidate for 2.6.36.

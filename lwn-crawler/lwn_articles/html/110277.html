<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/110267/">Version 2 of the Active Block I/O
Scheduling System (ABISS)</a> was released on November&nbsp;9.  At a first
glance, ABISS looks like yet another I/O scheduler for a kernel which
already has a few of them - and that it is.  But there is more to ABISS
which makes it worth a look.
<p>

The goal behind ABISS is to enable applications to request (and receive) a
guaranteed I/O rate to a specific file.  It is implementing a sort of
isochronous stream capability for the Linux block layer.  The target
applications might be multimedia recording and playback programs, or,
perhaps, some sort of data acquisition system.  Any application which needs
assurance that it can transfer data to or from the filesystem at a given
rate could benefit from ABISS.
<p>

For now, guaranteed data rates are only supported for read access, and only
for a few filesystems.  The core of the read side of ABISS is the "playout
buffer."  It is, for all practical purposes, a circular buffer in kernel
space which is filled at the requested I/O rate.  As long as the
application does not exceed its requested rate for long periods of time,
the data it requests should always be located in the buffer, and thus
immediately available.  The playout buffer is integrated with the page
cache, so accessing the file via <tt>mmap()</tt> will also work - though,
in that case, the application must inform ABISS of its progress through the
file so that playout buffer pages can be released when no longer needed.
<p>

Setting up this buffer requires a few steps.  The application uses an
<tt>ioctl()</tt> call to request a guaranteed read rate;  that request is then
passed back to a user-space daemon for approval.  The daemon is supposed to
keep track of all such requests and ensure that the system actually has
enough resources to implement another fixed-rate stream.  Any policy
decisions on which processes are allowed to request guaranteed-rate
behavior - and the rates they can ask for - are also made in the user-space
daemon.
<p>

If the daemon approves the request, the kernel builds an in-memory map of
the location of the file's data blocks.  This map is used when filling the
playout buffer; its real purpose is to do the file location lookup work
ahead of time and minimize unexpected I/O while the file is being
processed.

The operational phase consists of filling the playout buffer at the given
rate while not allowing it to get too large.  The idea is conceptually
simple, though the actual implementation involves a number of somewhat
tricky details.
<p>

ABISS differs from other I/O schedulers in that it does not just fit neatly
into the block layer.  Each filesystem must have ABISS support explicitly
added to it.  In particular, ABISS must be able to intercept
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls and, build the location map.  When the
filesystem-level code decides to look for a specific block within the file,
the ABISS code, which may already have that location in its map, needs a
chance to short out the usual lookup code.  Finally, ABISS must be notified
when a file is truncated, since it needs to adjust the location map to
match the new size.  Since filesystem-level changes are needed, ABISS does
not support all filesystems in the Linux kernel; version&nbsp;2 only works
with FAT, VFAT, and ext3.
<p>

Underneath it all is a real I/O scheduler.  The primary feature
there is the implementation of I/O request priorities.  Requests to fill
the playout buffer go in at a high priority, and will be executed before
most others.  The ABISS I/O scheduler also implements a set of "best
effort" priorities which can be used when guaranteed I/O rates are not
required.

      This sounds a lot like IRIX's GRIO feature for XFS.<br>

      Thank you for increasing my vocabulary for the day. I thought isochronous was a typo at first...:) <br>
<p>
Any who, this sounds great for database servers. We just have to get them to support it right? <br>

      The thing it'll be really good at is streaming media.  Imagine a future Linux kernel where something like RTAI and ABISS work together to keep your video or audio player streaming despite all manner of other disk thrashing (e.g., VMWare suspend to disk, or ripping a CD at x48 speed...).  Those are my simple needs.<br>
<p>
But other folks want to use Linux to *record* audio and video, and this will be a huge boon to those apps.  Last thing you want while recording is a dropped block of samples - no way to get it back.<br>
<p>
Another poster mentioned GRIO.  What I read about that is quite a few years old now, but it sounds like the goals were the same.  I very much look forward to this new capability in Linux.<br>

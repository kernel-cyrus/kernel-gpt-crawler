As the interface presented to user space by the kernel grows in complexity,
keeping that API stable is getting harder.  Greg Kroah-Hartman led a
session on this API and what can be done to improve things in this area.
The first thing Greg pointed out is the <tt>Documentation/ABI</tt>
directory in the kernel source, which is meant to be the definitive
description of the kernel interface.  Once an interface is described there,
the kernel is supposed to implement it that way, and, crucially, not change
it.  It was suggested that this documentation could be cited by users as a
way of complaining about inadvertent API changes, but Linus said it
wouldn't work that way.  Documentation, he says, is always wrong; it's what
the kernel actually does that matters.
<p>

With regard to stability, it was noted that <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls tend to
remain stable, while, for example, <tt>/proc</tt> and sysfs interfaces have
had a distressing tendency to change.  Some thought that the assignment of
an operation number somehow had the effect of impressing on developers that
changes could not be made.  There are, however, a couple of other, more
plausible arguments that were made:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Sysfs directly couples the kernel ABI to the internal data structures 
     used internally.  Kernel developers have never accepted limits on the
     changes they could make internally, but, with sysfs, all of those
     changes are reflected in the ABI - sometimes without the developer's
     knowledge.  Over time, this coupling is likely to be loosened.
<p>
<li> The Linux system call interface is, for the most part, an
     implementation of a well-established standard.  That standard gave
     little latitude in how the user-space API could work.  With interfaces
     like sysfs, however, the developers are in uncharted territory.  So it
     is not surprising that more mistakes are made in the creation of the
     API, and that it tends to be a little more fluid.
</ul>
<p>
Greg also stated that many of the problems with sysfs are the result of
errors on the user-space side.  Even Greg, in the development of
<tt>udev</tt>, got things wrong.  When asked whether this tendency toward
errors might indicate that the sysfs interface was inherently unsafe, he
replied in the negative.  It is hoped that the newer ABI documentation will
make the rules for working with sysfs more clear and less error-prone.
<p>

The discussion moved on to klibc and whether it should be a part of the
kernel.  Linus replied that klibc is not interesting by itself - it's more
a matter of what interesting things could be done with it.  And those
interesting things are yet to arrive; Linus is unconvinced by recent
efforts to move large chunks of code into user space.  There is usually no
point, he says, in moving working code out of the kernel, and, in any case,
anything which involves shared state should stay in the kernel.  So the
idea of moving much of the early boot process into initramfs might not get
very far.

<p>
Fears were expressed that, by putting more of the kernel into a user-space
initramfs area, the developers could create a situation where users are
tied to their distributor's kernel.  There is a strong desire to ensure
that mainline kernels continue to work on as many distributions as
possible.
<p>

One question which comes up occasionally is whether code which is tightly
coupled to the kernel should be packaged with the kernel.  A common example
is <tt>udev</tt>, which has been broken by a kernel release at least once.
If tools like <tt>udev</tt> lived with the kernel, the tools and the kernel
could be updated together and version skew problems would not develop.
There is some sympathy toward this idea, but no immediate plans to add any
tools to the kernel source tree.
<p>

When such plans are made, kernel crash dump tools might be at the top of
the list.  Another possibility is the <tt>hal</tt> program used by the
GNOME and KDE desktops.  It was described as "unmaintained crap" which is
heavily depended upon by the desktop environments.  The kernel developers,
it was suggested, should help to get <tt>hal</tt> onto a better footing,
possibly by bringing it into the kernel source tree.

      HAL = 'unmaintained crap'. wow. didn't see that one coming...<br>
<p>
Now I wonder - why would bringing something into the kernel tree ensure better maintainance? <br>
<p>
And would bringing as much as possible into the kernel not make things harder to maintain, as I can imagine its a bit harder to start contributing to the (big) kernel compared to a much smaller project?<br>
<p>
And what's the reason to push as much as possible to userspace? Yes, you can upgrade it, and it can be maintained by others than the kernel dev's, and you can fork it. But udev and hal are such 'outsourced' pieces of code, and now the kernel hackers think about making them part of the kernel (tough still userspace). So its not just positive, isn't it?<br>

      when something is in the kernel it gets more maintinance becouse when people change an interface they useually go through the kernel and change everything that uses that interface to match (and there's a good argument that doing so is (or should be) required by whoever wants the change)<br>
<p>
this by itself goes a long way towards solving maintinance issues. it doesn't cover all of them (especially the fact that sometimes changes shouldn't be just propagated, sometimes they should trigger much more significant changes), but it also significantly reduces the frustration of whoever is maintaining the system so that they just work on real fixes and improvements rather then chaseing updates.<br>

      It's interesting and surprising that they would consider adopting Hal. I <br>
think Hal's a very necessary project and needs some work, and bringing it <br>
into the kernel source would probably help. But it sounds like a little <br>
bit of a crazy idea. Isn't Hal supposed to be multiplatform?<br>
<p>
Perhaps what is needed is just better communication between Hal and LKML?<br>

      the HAL api presented to userspace should be cross platform, but the part of HAL that does the work is very platform specific. a cross platform version is just all the specific versions combined with ifdefs and similar<br>

      The different platform versions are actually in subdirectories, not ifdeffed out. HAL's not *that* ugly. :)<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 7, 2020</br>
           </div>
It has taken longer than anybody might have liked, but the IPv6 protocol is
slowly displacing IPv4 across the Internet.  A quick, highly scientific
"grep the access logs" test shows that about 16% of the traffic to
LWN.net is currently using IPv6, and many large corporate networks are
using IPv6 exclusively internally.  This version of the IP protocol was
designed to be more flexible than IPv4 in a number of ways; the "extension
header" mechanism is one way in which that flexibility is achieved.  A
proposal to formalize extension-header processing in the kernel's
networking stack has led to some concerns, though, about how this feature
will be used and what role Linux should play in its development.
<p>
In both versions of the IP protocol, the header of each packet contains a
collection of information about how the packet is to be handled; at a
minimum, it contains source and destination addresses and a higher-level
protocol number.  In IPv4, the contents of the header are rigidly
specified; it is difficult to add new types of information to the header.
When IPv6 was designed, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet#Extension_headers">extension
headers</a> were added as a way to (relatively) easily add new information
in the future.
<p>
A few extension header types are defined in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200">RFC8200</a> (which describes
IPv6).  Two of particular interest are the "Hop-by-Hop" and "Destination"
headers; the former is meant to be acted upon by every system that handles
the packet, while the latter is only for the destination node's attention.
These headers may contain one or more options, each encoded in a
type-length-value (TLV) format.  RFC8200 only defines a couple of options
that insert padding into the header, but there is interest in adding a
number of others.
<p>
For example, <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options-00">In-situ
Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
options</a> are meant to allow providers to collect telemetry information
on packets passing through their networks.  The <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hinden-6man-mtu-option-00">Path MTU
mechanism</a> uses a Hop-by-Hop option to discover the maximum packet size
a path can handle.  <a
href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-herbert-fast-04.txt">Firewall and
Service Tickets</a> (FAST) are a Hop-by-Hop option that documents a
packet's right to traverse a network or pass through a firewall.  The <a
href="/Articles/722804/">Segment
Routing</a> options  allows a packet to contain the path it should
take through a network.  And so on.

<p>
Tom Herbert has been working on <a
href="/ml/netdev/1577400698-4836-1-git-send-email-tom@herbertland.com/">a
patch series</a> making a number of changes to how IPv6 extension headers
are handled in Linux.  It adds infrastructure to allow kernel modules to
register their support for specific Hop-by-Hop and Destination options, and
makes the creation and parsing of the associated TLVs easy.  Specific
options may be added to packets or connections by unprivileged users, while
others are restricted to privileged users only; either way, the code tries
to ensure that the options are well-formed and ordered correctly.
<p>
One of the most controversial features is not actually a part of this patch
set; Herbert lists it as work for the future.  This feature would perform
the insertion of new extension headers into packets passing through a
system.  Header insertion is a violation of RFC8200, but that naturally
doesn't stop the purveyors of routers and other middleboxes from doing it
anyway.  That creates all of the usual problems, including packet
transmission failing for reasons that are entirely opaque to a distant
sender, proprietary headers leaking onto the public Internet, and more.
<p>
Networking maintainer David Miller was <a
href="/ml/netdev/20200102.134138.1618913847173804689.davem@davemloft.net/">less
than pleased</a> by the idea of adding header-insertion capabilities to the
Linux kernel:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And honestly, this stuff sounds so easy to misuse by governments
	and other entities.  It could also be used to allow ISPs to limit
	users in very undesirable and unfair ways.  And honestly,
	surveillance and limiting are the most likely uses for such a
	facility.  I can't see it legitimately being promoted as a
	"security" feature, really.
</div>
<p>
It is not hard to imagine how injected headers could be used.  They could
mark "slow lane" packets, for example, or packets that should be forwarded
to that mysterious locked room in an Internet service provider's basement.
These are not capabilities that Linux developers are generally enthusiastic
about supporting; it is thus not surprising that Miller made it clear that
he is in no hurry to merge this code into the networking subsystem.
<p>
Herbert <a
href="/ml/netdev/CALx6S37uWDOgWqx_8B0YunQZRGCyjeBY_TLczxmKZySDK4CteA@mail.gmail.com/">acknowledged</a>
Miller's concerns, but noted that router vendors will engage in abuse
regardless of whether Linux supports a specific feature.  None of this
behavior requires the use of extension headers at all.  Adding better
extension header support to the kernel, though, might be a way to minimize
the scope of these abuses in the future:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is why Linux is so critical to networking, it is the only open
	forum where real scrutiny is applied to how protocols are
	implemented. If the alternatives are given free [rein] to lead then it's
	very likely we'll end up being stuck with what they do and probably
	have to follow their lead regardless of how miserable they make the
	protocols. We've already seen this in segment routing, their
	attempts to kill IP fragmentation, and all the other examples of
	protocol ossification that unnecessarily restrict what hosts are
	allowed to send in the network and hence reduce the utility and
	security we are able to offer the user.
</div>
<p>
One way in which Herbert hopes to improve the situation is via a new <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-herbert-6man-eh-attrib/">attribution
option</a> that would at least allow network managers to determine the
source of an injected extension header that is causing problems.  As things
stand now, there is no way to know which system may be injecting
problematic headers into packets as they pass through.  More generally, he
hopes that showing how to do things "right" will help to deter the worst
hacks.  Miller was <a
href="/ml/netdev/20200103.124517.1721098411789807467.davem@davemloft.net/">skeptical</a>
about whether this could work; Herbert <a
href="/ml/netdev/CALx6S34vyjNnVbYfjqB1mNDDr3-zQixzXk=kgDqjJ0yxHVCgKg@mail.gmail.com/">countered</a>
with protocols like QUIC, TLS, and TCP fast open as examples of how Linux
developers have been able to steer protocols in a better direction in the
past.
<p>
That is where the conversation stands as of this writing.  How it is
resolved matters, though.  For all practical purposes, Linux is the
reference implementation and the proving ground for the protocols that make
up the public Internet.  Adoption by Linux ensures that a feature will be
available across the net; rejection can doom a feature in the long run.
But rejection also abdicates the community's role in the development of new
protocols, and Linux, too, can be routed around if the forces driving a
feature are strong enough.  Whether we want to resist header injection or
to try to mitigate its worst abuses from the inside is a question that the
networking community will need to find an answer to in the relatively near
future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmm, as far as we know, right now packets with EHs don't live long on the Internet.  Refer to RFC7872.<br>
<p>
Due to this, adding EHs to 3rd party packets going through a transit[1] network seems akin to sabotaging that packet flow to me, unless you also remove the added EHs before handing the packets over to the next AS (autonomous system)/ISP.  So, this is something to use inside your own networks, where you (supposedly) know nothing will drop that packet just because you added the EH (in which case, IME, you will have headaches for the next decade with other people within your network pushing for buying (or outright buying and deploying) incompatible crap and breaking network paths that used to work).<br>
<p>
I.e. exactly like IPv4 options.<br>
<p>
If anything, this kind of "feature" should be in DPDK and other zero-copy userspace data planes, or on the hardware flow offload devices.  The only reason to have it in-kernel would be to use it on very-low-performance (virtualized overlay ?) networks, as far as I know... or to direct the kernel to mangle packets being locally originated by applications you cannot "fix", before delivering them to the network.<br>
<p>
[1] In the Internet sense.  A transit network/provider/Autonomous System is an Autonomous System that is willing to forward packets from a client Autonomous System to its other client Autonomous Systems *and* to its own upstream transit networks.<br>

Back in Dec/Nov there was a huge mail thread in ietf ipv6/spring mail list about exactly the same issue. Cisco proposes to add SRH (ipv6 segment routing header) on transit nodes and there are plenty of IETF participants who disagree with that proposal. I think we should wait for standards track RFC which will at least guarantee rough consensus on the issue. <br>

<h1>Merging kdb and kgdb</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>February 17, 2010</br>
           </div>
<p>
It was something of a surprise when Linus Torvalds <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/278678/">merged</a> kgdb&mdash;a stub to talk
to the gdb debugger&mdash;back in the 2.6.26 merge window, because of his
well-known <a
href="http://lwn.net/2000/0914/a/lt-debugger.php3">disdain</a> for kernel
debuggers.  But there is another kernel debugging solution 
that has long been out of the mainline: kdb.  Jason Wessel has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/374203/">proposed</a> merging the two
solutions by reworking kgdb to use the "kdb shell" underneath, which would
lead to both solutions being available for kernel hackers.
</p>

<p>
The two debuggers serve different purposes, with kdb having much less
functionality, but they both have uses.  Kgdb allows source-level debugging
using gdb over a serial line, but that requires a separate system.  For
systems where it is painful or impractical to set up a serial connection,
kdb may provide enough capability to debug a problem.  In addition, things
like kernel modesetting (KMS) allow for additional features that kdb has
lacked.  Wessel described one possibility:
<div class="BigQuote">
A 2010 example of where kdb can be useful over kgdb is where you have a
small netbook, no serial ports etc... and you are running X and your
file system driver crashes the kernel.  With kdb plus kms you can get an
opportunity to see the crash which would have otherwise been lost from
/var/log/messages because the crash was in the file system driver.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While kgdb allows access to all of the standard debugging commands that
gdb provides, kdb has a much more limited command set.
One can examine and change memory locations or registers, set
breakpoints, and get a backtrace of the stack, but those commands typically
require using addresses, rather than symbolic names.  Currently, the best
reference for kdb commands comes from a <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-kdbug/">developerWorks
article</a>, though Wessel plans to change that.  There is some <a
href="http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jwessel/kdb/">documentation</a>
that comes with the patches, but a command reference will
depend on exactly which pieces, if any, actually land in the mainline.

</blockquote>
<p>
It should be noted that one of the capabilities that was removed from kdb
as part of the merger is the disassembler.  It was x86 specific, and the
new code is "<q>99% platform independent</q>", according to the <a
href="http://kgdb.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/KDB_FAQ">FAQ</a> about the
merged code.  Because kgdb is implemented for many architectures, rewriting
it atop kdb led to support for many more architectures for kdb.  Instead of
just the x86 family, kdb now supports arm, blackfin, mips, sh, powerpc, and
sparc. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, kgdb and kdb can work together.  From a running kgdb session,
one can use the gdb <tt>monitor</tt> command to access kdb commands.  There
are several that might be helpful like
<tt>ps</tt> for a process list or <tt>dmesg</tt> to see log output. 
</p>

<p>The FAQ <a
href="http://kgdb.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/KDB_FAQ#Why_merge_kdb_and_kgdb.3F">lists</a>
a number of other advantages that would come from the merge, 
beyond just getting kdb into the mainline so that its users no longer have to
patch their kernels,  The basic
idea behind the advantages listed is to unite the users and developers of
kgdb and kdb so 
that they are all pulling in the same direction, because "<q>both kdb
and kgdb have similar needs in terms of how they integrate into the
kernel</q>".  There have been arguments in the past about which of the
two solutions is best, but, since they serve different use cases, having
both available would have another benefit: "<q>No longer will people
have to debate which is better, kdb or kgdb, why do we have only
one... Just go use the best tool for the job.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
Wessel notes that Ubuntu has enabled kgdb in recent kernels, which is
something he would like to see done by other distributions.  If kdb is
available, that too could be enabled, which would make it easier for users
to access the functionality:
<div class="BigQuote">
My other hope is that the new kdb is much easier to use in the sense
that the barrier of entry is much lower.  For example, someone with a
laptop running a kernel with a kdb enabled kernel can use it as easily as:

<pre>
    echo kms,kbd > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc
    echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    dmesg
    bt
    go
</pre>

And voila you just ran the kernel debugger.
</div>
<p>
In the example above, Wessel shows how to enable kdb (for keyboard (kbd)
and KMS operation), then trap into it
using sysrq-g (once enabled, kdb will also be invoked if there is a panic or
oops).  The following three commands are kdb commands for looking at log
output, getting a stack backtrace, and continuing execution.

<p>
The patches themselves are broken up into three separate patchsets: the
first and largest adds the kdb infrastructure into <tt>kernel/debug/</tt>
and moves 
<tt>kgdb.c</tt> into that directory, the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/374204/">second</a> adds KMS support
for kdb 
along with an experimental patch to do atomic modesetting for the i915
graphics driver, and the <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/374205/">third</a> allows kernel debugging
via kdb or kgdb early in the boot process; starting from the point where
<tt>earlyprintk()</tt> is available. 
Wessel is targeting 2.6.34 and, at least so far, the patches have been well
received.  The most recent posting is version 3 of the patchset, with a
long list of changes made in response to earlier comments.  Furthermore, an
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332611/">RFC</a> about the 
idea last May gained a fair number of comments that clearly indicated there
was interest in kdb and merging it with the kgdb code.
</p>

<p>
Sharp-eyed readers will note some similarities between this proposal and the
recent <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/371210/">utrace push</a>.  In both
cases, an existing debugging facility was rewritten using a new core, but
there are differences as well.  Unlike utrace, the kdb/kgdb patches
directly provide some lacking user-space functionality.  Whether that is
enough to overcome Torvalds's semi-hostile attitude towards kernel
debuggers&mdash;though the inclusion of kgdb would seem to indicate some
amount of softening&mdash;remains to be seen.

Off-topic, but what is the status of kgdboe?  Anyone know?  Last I checked it was not in the mainline kernel.  Is anyone maintaining this?  Is anyone trying to get it merged?<br>

There is no active work presently to get kgdboe merged to the mainline.  Kgdboe is viewed as an unstable connection type in its current design.<br>
<p>
For example, with IRQ preemption there is no safe way to share the ethernet hardware.  There are few if any ethernet drivers that have a completely robust NET POLL API implementation.  The remaining problem is that the amount of code which cannot be debugged with kgdboe is much larger than when using the dbgp or serial based I/O driver.<br>
<p>
There are several proposals in existence about how to change the design and at the point that someone picks up one of those to carry forward you would also have the capability to run kdb over the kgdboe I/O driver.<br>

Hi Jason, which of these proposals do you consider reasonable, and could you please point us to any of them?  I am maintaining a large driver that really needs the high speed of kgdboe (plus the ability to debug laptops that have no serial port), so I've been thinking about doing this for some time now.<br>

Debuggers are invaluable to understand bugs in poorly designed or poorly implemented software.<br>

Since Linux is perfectly designed, implemented and documented there is no need for a Linux debugger. Linus is right!<br>

I think Linus' argument is if the code is so hard to follow you can't see <br>
how it ended up in it's final state then that's a problem with the code. The <br>
worry is using debuggers can short circuit understanding the code path and <br>
result in fixes that address the symptom rather than the cause.<br>
<p>
I can see the logic although I think he discounts the usefulness of being <br>
able to diagnose system state at failure points. Certainly I'd hate to debug <br>
my user-space code with just a faulting address and register dump at the <br>
fault point.<br>

Yes, this is the part that I do not understand. "Debuggers are terrible as a design tool, so... better not use any for investigation?!" That sounds a bit extreme.<br>
<p>
<p>
Linus prefers not to see any kid playing with sharp knives in the kitchen, since they are only supposed to bake cakes. He is concerned about any blood accidentally polluting the kernel: fair enough. But that does not explain why he, an adult, is also not using any.<br>
<p>
Wait: maybe he is secretly using a kernel debugger. Just like any other parent: "do what I say" (not what I do).<br>

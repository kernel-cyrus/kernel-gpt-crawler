</div>
Linux is not heavily used in safety-critical systems â€” yet.  There is an
increasing level of interest in such deployments, though, and that is
driving a number of initiatives to determine how Linux can be made suitable
for safety-critical environments.  At the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), Michal Sojka shone a light on one
corner of this work: testing the thermal characteristics of Linux systems
with an eye toward deployment in avionics systems.
<p>
In particular, his focus is on how scheduling decisions can affect the
thermal behavior of computers in avionic systems; this effort is part of the
European <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/832011">THERMAC
project</a>.  The requirements for avionic systems include doing without
both fans and heavy heat sinks while getting as much performance out of
each system as thermal constraints will allow.  There is no room for
missed deadlines in safety-critical work, so there is not much space for
the usual thermal-management techniques there.  But these systems also support
best-effort workloads that run when time and temperatures allow; that is
where it may be possible to improve the situation with clever power
management.
<p>
These systems tend to use time-partitioned scheduling. Each
safety-critical task runs within its own time window; any time left over within the
window when that work is done can be used for best-effort workloads.
The good news, Sojka said, was that the workloads on these systems are well
understood; that is a distinct difference from the systems discussed in <a
href="/Articles/820432/">the previous session</a>, where the kernel has to
make guesses about what is going to happen next.
<p>
This work, so far, has not yet come up with any thermal-aware scheduling
strategies; that is for a later stage.  What is being done now is to put
together the framework for evaluating such strategies so it will be
possible to know which ones actually work.  To that end, the project has
built a testbed based on a leading-edge NXP i.MX8 board; thermal sensors
and a thermal camera have been added to that.  Control groups are being
used to simulate the scheduling windows that will be used on a real system.
<p>
The work so far has resulted in a framework called "<a
href="https://github.com/CTU-IIG/thermobench">thermobench</a>"; Sojka
described it as "a fancy CSV file generator".  It will run a series of
benchmarks, capturing measurements (temperatures, CPU frequencies, CPU

<a href="/Articles/820571/"><img

align="right"></a> 

loads, etc.) as they go.  When the runs are complete, the system can create
plots of what happened.  The benchmarks in the repository now include
various micro-instruction tests and tests that evaluate a variety of sleep
patterns.
<p>
The system can also perform model fitting in order to get a sense for the
changes that happen at different time scales; some changes happen much more
quickly than others, leading to a model equation with three distinct terms.
The temperature at the heat sink can change within a
minute, while whole-board temperature changes play out over four or five
minutes.  There is also an 18-minute term which, he surmised, was the
response of the entire testbed.  Among other things, these results tell
them how long each test needs to run for.
<p>
In conclusion, he said, thermobench will be useful for comparing various
thermal management strategies.  He wondered whether others might find it
useful for their areas as well.  Vincent Guittot asked whether the tests
included CPU-frequency scaling; Sojka answered the tests that were shown
are all single-frequency tests, but multiple-frequency tests have been done
as well.  He said that temperature is not a linear function of CPU
frequency, but did not get into details.

<p>
Rafael Wysocki said that the tests should always measure both the power
consumption of the board and the temperature, since the two are somewhat
independent of each other. Giovanni Gherdovich asked whether the realtime
preemption 
patches had been tested, noting that kernels with those patches have
different performance and power-usage profiles.  Sojka answered that the
test board is quite new and is currently not able to run a mainline kernel;
he expressed interest in hearing what NXP's plans are for getting support
upstream.  Once that happens, he will be happy to experiment with the
realtime patches.
<p>
Souvik Chakravarty pointed out that a number of factors affect power
usage.  For example, what is the power structure of the board?  If all CPUs
are on a single power rail, it will be necessary to stop them all to gain
significant power (and thermal) savings.  Sojka said that the processor in
question has six <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE">big.LITTLE</a> CPUs,
and the project is testing on the little 
CPUs only.  But details like the power layout are not entirely clear.
<p>
Sojka concluded by encouraging attendees to check out the thermobench code,
which had been posted that very day.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems that with respect to power management, seL4 does only "wfi" (ARM) in the idle thread. This is all right for a microkernel. Is there some user-space component responsible for PM things like DVFS?<br>

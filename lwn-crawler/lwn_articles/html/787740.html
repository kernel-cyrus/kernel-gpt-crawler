<tt>kmalloc()</tt> is one of the kernel's fundamental memory-allocation
primitives for relatively small objects.  Most of the time, developers
don't worry about the alignment of memory returned from
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>, and things generally just work.  But, Vlastimil Babka
said during a plenary session at the 2019 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, every now and then
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> will do something surprising.  He proposed tightening
the guarantees around object alignment in the hope of generating fewer
surprises in the future.
<p>
In particular, Babka wanted to discuss when <tt>kmalloc()</tt> should
return objects with their "natural alignment".  What that term means was
not actually defined until near the end of the session; presumably nobody
will object to a slight bit of reordering at this point.  Natural alignment
for an object means that its beginning address is a multiple of each of up
to three
different quantities: <tt>ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN</tt> (eight bytes, by

default), the cache-line size (for larger objects), and the size of the
object itself when that size is a power of two.  The actual required
alignment will generally be the least common multiple of the three.
<p>
Most of the time, Babka said, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> already returns naturally
aligned objects for a power-of-two allocation size; that result falls out
of how the 
slab pages are laid out.  But there are exceptions: when SLUB debugging is
enabled or when the SLOB allocator is used.  Few people worry much about
SLOB, but the SLUB debugging exception can lead to problems for unsuspecting
developers.
<p>
That is because code can come to depend on receiving objects with natural
alignment 
without the developer realizing; then, one day, they turn on SLUB debugging
and things break.  Babka has found a number of Stack Overflow questions
about the alignment guarantees for <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, often with incorrect
answers.  XFS, in particular, is subject to breaking due to the block-size
alignment requirement it has for some objects.  There are some workarounds
in place, but even then, XFS is depending on implementation details rather
than explicit guarantees.  These workarounds also increase memory use
unnecessarily.
<p>
James Bottomley asked why XFS has this alignment requirement; Christoph
Hellwig responded that XFS is "just the messenger" with regard to this
problem.  Another source of trouble, he said, is any of a number of devices
with strange alignment requirements for I/O buffers.  Matthew Wilcox said,
somewhat sarcastically, that it would be great if the block layer could do
bounce buffering for such devices; Hellwig responded seriously that
developers are trying to reduce bounce buffering, not increase it.
Besides, there are other places using memory from <tt>kmalloc()</tt> for
I/O; any of them could show the problem.
<p>
One possible solution, for code where there are known alignment
requirements, would be to use <tt>kmem_cache_alloc()</tt> to create a cache
with an explicit alignment size.  But that requires creating caches
ahead of time for each possible allocation size.  Dave Hansen said that,
given that the default is to provide good behavior, perhaps caches created
with explicit alignment could be coalesced back into the default caches,
thus reducing the overhead  Babka said that would be messy to implement;
the group discussed the feasibility of this idea for a while without coming
to any real conclusions.
<p>
Another possibility, Babka said, would be to create a new
<tt>kmalloc_aligned()</tt> function that would take an explicit alignment
parameter.  That would be useful in situations where the required alignment
is larger than the natural size.  Developers would have to know about it
(and about their alignment requirements) to use it, though, suggesting that
it might not be used in places where it is needed.
<p>
So, Babka said, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> should simply be defined to return
naturally aligned objects when the allocation size is a power of two.  No
changes would be required to implement that guarantee with SLAB or with
SLUB without debugging enabled.  In the SLUB-with-debugging case, there
would be a cost in the form of more wasted memory.  Implementing the
alignment guarantee with SLOB would end up fragmenting the heap more than
it already is.
<p>
Wilcox said that there wasn't really a need for SLUB red-zone debugging
(which traps accesses outside of the allocated object) now that KASAN
works; perhaps it could just be deleted?  It seems, though, that other
developers still find this feature useful.
KASAN has a high overhead and must be
built into the kernel; red-zones can be enabled at run time.  Ted Ts'o said
that, while he is willing to turn on red zones, he finds KASAN too painful
to enable most of the time.  Hellwig said he turns on red zones whenever
somebody comes up with "a crazy new data structure".
<p>
While providing an alignment guarantee would make life easier for
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> users, Babka said, there are some costs as well.
Kernels with SLUB
debugging enabled would be less efficient and SLOB would be less efficient
overall.  The guarantee could also restrict possible improvements to the
slab allocators in the future.  Christoph Lameter said that it could make
storing metadata with objects harder.
<p>
Bottomley suggested a variant: natural alignment for objects up to 512
bytes, but a maximum of 512-byte alignment for larger objects up to the
size of a page.  Anything at least as large as one page would have page
alignment.  Babka said that this kind of special rule would only serve to
complicate the implementation.  Ts'o said that it is not worth trying too
hard to avoid every potential cost of an alignment guarantee; spending a
little more memory for more predictable behavior is worth it.
<p>
Hugh Dickins worried that SLOB users, who tend to be running on
memory-constrained devices, might suffer from this change.  Their memory
overhead will get higher, and the memory-management developers will not
hear about it for a long time.  Babka replied, though, that the situation
is not that bad; there will be more holes in the heap, but they will end up
being filled by smaller objects.  Wilcox noted, though, that SLOB uses the
four bytes ahead of each object to store its size; doing that while
aligning user data will be "obnoxious".  Babka closed the session by saying
that he would look more closely at the actual overhead with SLOB, saying
that it would be unfortunate if the little-used SLOB allocator were to
block this project.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

kmalloc_aligned is a natural solution that mirrors the posix_memaligned and aligned_alloc interfaces in glibc. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Aligned-Memory-Blocks.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Aligne...</a>.<br>
<p>
Specific alignment for memory objects is necessary for using many of the 128-512 bit registers and processor APIs that are more frequent these days for cryptography, image processing, etc. <br>
<p>
With the memory side-channel attacks we live with, cache-line alignment is also something that is frequently necessary for memory variables. I would use a kmalloc_aligned api as soon as it becomes available.<br>

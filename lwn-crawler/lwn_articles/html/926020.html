           </div>
The kernel's direct map makes all of a system's physical memory available
to the kernel within its address space â€” on 64-bit systems, at least.  This
seemingly simple feature has proved to be hard to maintain, in the face of
the requirements faced by current systems, while keeping good performance.
The latest attempt to address this issue is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230308094106.227365-1-rppt@kernel.org/">this patch
set</a> from Mike Rapoport adding more direct-map awareness to the kernel's
page allocator.
<p>
<h4>Direct-map fragmentation</h4>
<p>
Over the course of a system's operation, the kernel will likely end up
having to access almost every page of memory; if nothing else, it will need
to load executable text and clear anonymous pages before giving them to
user-space processes.  The direct map is clearly useful for this work, as
can be seen by <a href="/Articles/836144/">the difficulties</a> caused by
systems that lack enough address space to hold a complete direct map.  For
much of its operation (including most memory accesses internally), the
kernel simply uses direct-map addresses rather than a separate map for
kernel space.
<p>
As a result, efficient access to the direct map is important; the way the
direct map is managed has a significant effect on how efficient that access
is.  To understand the problem, a quick refresher on how page tables work
may help.  While page tables can seem like a simple linear array mapping
page-frame numbers to physical pages, that would not be workable in
practice; instead, page tables are implemented as a sparse hierarchy.  Here
is a simplistic diagram of how virtual addresses are interpreted first used
in <a href="/Articles/568076/">this 2013 article</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/address-translation.png" class="photo"
alt="[Virtual address translation]">
</blockquote>
<p>
This diagram shows four levels of page tables: the page global directory
(PGD), page upper directory (PUD), page middle directory (PMD), and the
page-table entries (PTE).  Current systems can add <a
href="/Articles/717293/">a fifth level</a>, the P4D, between the PGD and
the PUD.  Virtual-address translation involves stepping through each level
of the hierarchy; if the relevant data is not in the processor caches, this
process can take a long time.  To improve performance, processors have
a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) that caches the result of a small
number of recent translations.  If an address is found in the TLB, the
page-table walk can be avoided; improving the TLB hit rate can thus
significantly increase the performance of the system.
<p>
One way to improve TLB usage is to use huge pages.  A huge page has a
special entry in one of the higher-level directories (the PMD or the PUD)
saying that translation stops there.  A PMD-level huge page will be (on
most architectures) 2MB in size; a single PMD huge page can replace 512
PTE-level ("base") pages, all of which can be accessed through a single TLB
entry.  A (typically) 1GB PUD-level huge page expands the reach of a TLB
entry even further.
<p>
The kernel's direct map is created using huge pages to reduce the TLB usage
of kernel-space code, with measurable results.
There is a problem, though: a huge page is managed by a single entry in the
appropriate page directory, meaning that the same access permissions apply
to the whole page.  If the kernel needs to change the permissions for some
base pages within a huge page, it must first break that huge page up into
smaller pages, with a corresponding loss in access performance.
<p>
Increasingly, kernel developers are finding themselves needing to change
direct-map permissions.  Various sorts of <a
href="/Articles/886494/">address-space isolation mechanisms</a>, for
example, might remove some pages from the direct map entirely to prevent
unwanted access.  The increasingly stringent prohibition on pages that are
both writable and executable means that, if the kernel needs to load
executable code into its address space, it must split up any huge pages
holding the target memory so that write permission can be removed and
execute permission added; this happens when kernel modules and BPF programs
are loaded, for example.
<p>
Breaking up one huge page to load a module or BPF program, or to isolate
some memory, is not a huge problem.  As the system runs, though, this can
happen repeatedly, fragmenting the direct map over time.  On systems where,
for example, BPF programs are frequently loaded, the result can be a badly
fragmented direct map and equally bad performance.  This problem has led to
a number of efforts, such as the <a href="/Articles/915005/">BPF program
allocator</a>, intended to minimize the effect on the direct map.
<p>
<h4>Improving the page allocator</h4>
<p>
Rapoport's patch addresses this problem by adding yet another <a
href="/Articles/920891/">allocation flag</a> called
<tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt>.  When kernel code allocates one or more pages using
this flag, they will be removed from the direct map before being returned
to the caller.  The value that is added is not just in the direct-map
removal, though, but also in the cache that the page allocator maintains
for <tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt> allocations.
<p>
When the first such allocation request is made, the allocator will remove a
PMD-sized huge page from the direct map, use a portion of it to satisfy the
request, and hang onto the rest to satisfy future requests.  Unmapped pages
that are freed will be retained in that cache as well.  The effect will be
to focus these special requests on a single region of memory, avoiding the
fragmentation of the direct map as a whole.  There is also the inevitable
shrinker that can be called when memory is tight; that will cause the
release of pages in the <tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt> cache back to the kernel
for use elsewhere.
<p>
The patch set includes two uses of the new facility.  One of those is in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.5/source/arch/x86/kernel/module.c#L68">the
x86 implementation of <tt>module_alloc()</tt></a>, which allocates space
for loadable kernel modules.  The other is in the implementation of <a
href="/Articles/865256/"><tt>memfd_secret()</tt></a>, which removes the
allocated space from the direct map entirely, making it inaccessible to the
kernel.
<p>
There are no benchmark results included with the patch set, so it is not
really possible at this point to quantify just how much it can improve the
performance of the system.  The performance effects will be heavily
workload-dependent in any case.  But the problem being solved is well
understood, and the effects of direct-map fragmentation have been measured
in the past.  So it seems clear that some sort of solution will need to be
merged at some point.  Whether this latest attempt is that solution remains
to be seen; that may be a question for the upcoming <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">LSFMM/BPF conference</a>

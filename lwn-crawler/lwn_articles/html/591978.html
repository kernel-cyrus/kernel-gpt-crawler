</div>
Like many parts of the core kernel, the memory management subsystem is
highly sensitive to lock contention, which can quickly ruin performance.
Davidlohr Bueso has been working on fixing some locking problems in that
code; he led a session in the memory management track of the 2014 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit to talk about the
directions for that work.
<p>
Two locks that show contention problems are the <tt>anon_vma</tt> lock,
which controls access to virtual memory areas representing regions of
anonymous pages, and the <tt>i_mmap_mutex</tt>, which protects several
fields of the <tt>address_space</tt> structure.  These locks were once

<a href="/Articles/592089/"><img

mutexes, but the read-mostly access patterns for those data structures led
developers to switch them to reader/writer semaphores (rwsems) instead.
The only problem is that performance took a significant hit whenever it
became necessary to do a non-trivial amount of writing to those data
structures.
<p>
Some of that performance was regained through the application of "rwsem
stealing," whereby a thread that is running  can grab a
lock ahead of another thread which had been waiting for it.  But, Davidlohr
said, what was missing was the sort of adaptive spinning found in regular
mutexes.  Even though a mutex is a sleeping lock, a thread trying to
acquire it may spin for a while in the hope that the lock will be released
soon; doing so can yield a significant performance boost.  Adding spinning
to the rwsem implementation gets performance back to previous levels for
all workloads.  So, Davidlohr asked, is there any opposition to merging
that code?  The response in the room suggested that no such opposition
exists.
<p>
In the case of the <tt>anon_vma</tt> lock, there is a strong desire to
avoid using a sleeping lock at all.  The rwlock mechanism exists for just
that use case, but there are fairness issues with rwlocks.  Waiman Long has
done some work with queued rwlocks, which address those issues while also
improving performance.  Peter Zijlstra noted that he has rewritten those
patches, but is not quite sure what to do with the results.  He likes the
fairness, but lacks good benchmarks by which to judge them.  There are
still problems using these locks on virtualized systems.  Even so, he is
not opposed to merging this code.
<p>
Not everybody feels quite the same way, though.  Sagi Grimberg noted that
he has code that needs to be able to sleep in functions like
<tt>invalidate_page()</tt>, where the <tt>anon_vma</tt> lock can be held.
So turning that lock into a non-sleeping lock would clearly create
problems.  This kind of need comes up in areas like InfiniBand and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">RDMA</a>, 
where work that can potentially sleep has to be done in settings where this
lock is held.  Mechanisms like <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/xpmem/">xpmem</a> also have this problem.
<p>
Rik van Riel suggested that the best way to avoid problems is to get the
relevant code upstream as soon as possible, but Davidlohr protested that
the performance cost of using a sleeping lock is severe.  Peter added that
Linus has had "choice words" for authors of code needing a sleeping
<tt>anon_vma</tt> lock.  So, he said, the right thing to do with the
non-sleeping lock patches would be to send them to Linus with an
explanation of what would break if they were applied.  Then we could all
see what Linus chooses to do.
<p>
Davidlohr went on to say that he would also like to restart the discussion
of the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore, which protects many parts of a
process's address space.  It is often held for too long, he said, creating
excessive latencies.  We are also serializing too much work.  It is not
necessary, he said, to lock the entire address space if work is being done
on a portion of that space.  Perhaps it is time to look at range locking as
a way to reduce <tt>mmap_sem</tt> contention?
<p>
Michel Lespinasse responded that, while range locking might make
sense, it would be better to work on eliminating long hold times for
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  Rik suggested that, perhaps, it could be turned into a
per-virtual-memory-area lock, but Peter responded that this has been tried
in the past.  The patches have ended up replacing <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
contention with contention for a "big VMA lock" instead.
<p>
Jan Kara raised the problem of holding <tt>mmap_sem</tt> when the memory
management subsystem calls into filesystem code.  Beyond performance
problems, this pattern can create lock inversion issues as well.  He has
been working on eliminating the places where <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is held for
filesystem calls for some time; that work is getting closer to being ready.
There are 
just a couple of remaining problem areas,  one of which is the page fault
handling code, but there are solutions to that problem.  
<p>
The other is calls to <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, which requires that the
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> be held by the caller.  Jan has been converting callers to
<tt>get_user_pages_fast()</tt>, which does not have that requirement.  Most
of the easy cases have been handled, but a few of the harder issues
remain.  Sometimes <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> is called in situations where
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> has been acquired by higher-level code.  The Video4Linux
videobuf2 code has some interesting usages of its own which are hard to
convert.  
<p>
But the most worrisome area is uprobes, which needs to be able to place
breakpoints into program code (text) pages when they are brought into
memory.  This code registers a callback on 
the creation of virtual memory areas; if need be, it installs breakpoints
into text pages when they are instantiated.  This results in a
call into filesystem code from well within an <tt>mmap()</tt> call.
Peter suggested that this one could be fixed by reordering the
<tt>mmap()</tt> code.  The initial setup work could be done, after which
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> would be dropped and the page contents could be filled.
That would create a window where a program might be able to access some of
the mapped pages before their initialization is complete, but, Peter said,
no well-behaved program will access pages created by <tt>mmap()</tt> before
that call returns, so there should be no problems.
<p>
The session ended with some inconclusive discussion on rationalizing the
naming of the growing family of <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> variants.

Opening a window in which programs can access pages before the initialization is completed would be a security problem, wouldn't it?<br>

I think the only initiation that would need to wait for mmap_sem to drop is file contents backed by filesystems, i.e. not MAP_ANONYMOUS mappings. Maybe you zero the memory first before dropping mmap_sem in either case?<br>

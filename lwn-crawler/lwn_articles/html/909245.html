<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2022-Linux_Security_Summit_Europe">LSS EU</a>
</div>
<p>
Andrey Konovalov began his 2022 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-europe/">Linux
Security Summit Europe</a> (LSS EU) talk with a bold statement: "fuzzing is
useless".  As might be guessed, he qualified that assertion quickly by
adding "without dynamic bug detectors".   These bug detectors include
"sanitizers" of various sorts, such as the <a
href="https://google.github.io/kernel-sanitizers/KASAN">Kernel Address
Sanitizer</a> (KASAN), but there are others. Konovalov looked in detail at KASAN
and gave an overview of the
sanitizer landscape along with some ideas of ways to push these bug
detectors further—to find even more kernel bugs.
</p>

<p>
Fuzzers are great for exercising new paths in the code, but without having
some kind of bug detector, they typically end up causing some kind of
hard-to-debug kernel crash, he said.  The sanitizers and other bug
detectors 
turn those 
bugs into something that can be tracked down—and fixed. 
These <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers">sanitizers</a> make up a
family of bug-detection tools.  They were 
originally created for user-space applications, but were ported to the
kernel and had a "K" prepended to their acronym.  The <a
href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a>
(ASan) was not the first, but it became somewhat famous early on; others
include the
<a
href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer">MemorySanitizer</a> 
(MSan) and <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer</a>
(UBSan).

<p>
There are a number of advantages that the sanitizers have, which have led to
their popularity.
They are easy to use; for user
space it is just an extra compiler flag and for the kernel a build
configuration 
option needs to be enabled.  Compared to other tools that provide the same
features, the sanitizers are fast as well.   They are also precise since
all of the 
bugs they report are true bugs and not false positives; occasionally a
false positive does arise, but it is caused by a sanitizer bug that
promptly gets fixed, he said.  In addition, the sanitizers provide detailed
reports on what caused a bug, which makes it much easier to track them down
and fix them.  
</p>

<h4>KASAN</h4>

<p>
KASAN detects memory
corruptions in the kernel; in particular, it finds out-of-bounds access,
use-after-free bugs, and double (or invalid) free operations.  It looks for
those kinds of problems in various kernel memory regions: the slab
allocators, page allocators,
the vmalloc area, the stack, and global memory.  It requires compiler
support, but 
the feature has been available in both Clang and GCC for quite some time
now, so that should not be any real barrier.  The original mode of KASAN
has been rebranded as "generic KASAN" because 
two other modes have been added over the years; he would be concentrating on
generic KASAN in the talk, though he would briefly mention the other modes.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/909622/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lsseu-konovalov-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Andrey Konovalov]" title="Andrey Konovalov" width=213
height=280> 
</a>

<p>
There are two parts to KASAN, a compiler piece that is implemented in Clang
and GCC, and run-time support, which is implemented in the kernel itself.
The compiler module instruments the memory accesses in the kernel as it is
being built; the module also adds red zones (regions of inaccessible, or
poisoned, memory) for global variables and the
stack. The run-time piece maintains the shadow memory that is used to track
the state of the kernel memory; it also hooks into the kernel allocators to
track allocations and free operations.  Beyond that, it is responsible for
detecting when bugs have happened and creating a report detailing them.
</p>

<p>
Shadow memory uses one byte for every eight bytes of kernel memory in
order to track the status of each of those regions.
When looking at kernel memory, an aligned eight-byte chunk of memory can really
only have nine different states with regard to whether a given byte is
allowed to be accessed or not.  The granularity of kernel allocations is
such that some number of contiguous bytes at the beginning of that
eight-byte region are 
accessible, followed by some 
number of inaccessible bytes; there is no situation where there will
be a more than a single range of accessible bytes or one that does not
start at the beginning of a region.  
</p>

<p>
That allows the state of the region to be encoded in just a few
bits by using the number of
accessible bytes in the region, though 0 is used to indicate that all bytes
are
accessible. So, 7 means that the
first seven bytes are accessible, for example.  Since there is a full byte
used to encode the state, however,
that allows for multiple values describing the memory that should not be
accessed. The all-bytes-inaccessible case can then  specify
the type of memory it is (e.g. slab red zone, free page, invalid vmalloc
memory, etc.) with a flag value outside of the&nbsp;0-7 range.
</p>

<p>
The shadow memory resides in a contiguous chunk of the address space with a
known 
offset.  The address of the shadow memory byte that corresponds to a given
kernel address can easily be calculated by adding
<tt>addr&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;3</tt> to the offset.
</p>

<p>
The compiler instruments each memory access with a check of the
corresponding location in shadow memory just before the access is
performed.  If the value of the shadow memory 
is non-zero for an eight-byte access, <tt>kasan_report()</tt> is called to
indicate a problem.  Similarly, accesses of less than eight bytes are
checked to ensure that there are sufficient accessible bytes in the region;
otherwise, the report function is called.
</p>

<p>
The kernel is allocating and freeing memory constantly, so KASAN needs to
ensure that the shadow memory is updated to reflect those changes.  It does
so by adding hooks to the various allocators in the kernel, which can be
seen by looking for "<tt>kasan_</tt>" in the kernel source.  Konovalov then went
into the details of how KASAN works with the slab allocators.
</p>

<p>
A slab is fully marked as inaccessible when it is
initialized.  Objects in the slab are then "unpoisoned" by marking them as
accessible when they get allocated.  KASAN maintains a poisoned red zone
between each pair of allocated objects, which reduces the number of objects
that can 
fit, but allows it to ensure the kernel is not accessing beyond the end of the
objects.  When objects are freed, they are poisoned as well.
</p>

<p>
When objects are allocated with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, they are allocated from
a kmalloc cache that is generally larger than the requested size; if 100
bytes are 
allocated, they will be allocated from the kmalloc-128 cache, so there are
28 unused bytes.  KASAN poisons those 28 bytes and also adds a poisoned
red zone after the object.  If the kernel calls <a
href="/Articles/319686/">the <tt>ksize()</tt> function</a> to gain access
to the full length of the allocated object, KASAN will unpoison the piece
at the end of the object, but, of course, the second red zone is still
present to detect buffer overruns.
</p>

<p>
KASAN wants to be able to detect use-after-free problems as well, but
normally the kernel will reallocate an object immediately after it is
freed.  Since that will look like valid memory to KASAN, any access from a
lingering reference will go undetected.  So KASAN puts freed slab objects
onto a quarantine list in order to delay their reuse.  That increases the
chances that KASAN will catch after-free accesses because the freed object will
stay around for a while in a poisoned state.
</p>

<p>
With the help of the compiler, KASAN is able to insert red zones into the
kernel stack and global variables.  For stack variables, the compiler can
insert a red zone before and after the variable and generate code to poison
the red zones and unpoison the variable itself.  On the way out of the
function, the red zones get unpoisoned since they are part of the stack
frame that is about to be popped.
A similar thing is done for global variables.  The compiler turns a global
variable into a structure with a red zone that gets poisoned via a
constructor that the compiler adds.  Those constructors get inserted into the
main kernel binary and the module binaries as well.
</p>

<p>
When KASAN detects a bug, it must create a report that is detailed enough
to lead a kernel developer to the problem.  In order to do so, KASAN keeps
stack traces for allocations and frees in the stack depot, which was
initially developed for KASAN but is now used by various subsystems in the
kernel to store stack traces.  Each stack trace is identified with a
four-byte handle; since those need to be stored with the allocations they
correspond to, the red zones are used for the allocation path, while the
handles are normally stored in the freed objects for the freeing path.
</p>

<p>
He showed an example of what KASAN reports when it detects a problem.
He used a case from the KASAN test suite of an out-of-bounds access and the
report showed the details of the access, where it occurred in the code, and
a stack trace when the access occurred.  Then it shows the stack trace of
where the 
object was allocated; if there were a relevant stack trace for freeing the
object, that would be shown as well.  After that, KASAN tries to describe
the type of memory that was affected and the contents of the shadow memory
surrounding the problem access.
</p>

<p>
Some parts of the kernel are not covered by KASAN, including the assembly
and early boot code.  The instrumentation that is added by the compiler is
normally done as inline functions, but there is a setting to change that so
that regular function calls are used.  That will run more slowly, but it
creates a smaller kernel image, which may be useful in constrained
environments. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond the generic mode that he had just described, which is supported by
multiple architectures, KASAN has two other
modes that work with arm64 memory tagging; he described them further
later in the
talk.  KASAN has two test suites, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19/source/lib/test_kasan.c">one</a>
that uses the <a href="/Articles/780985/">KUnit unit-testing framework</a>
and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19/source/lib/test_kasan_module.c">another</a>
that does not; all of the tests in the latter, except for one that has a
user-space component to test
<tt>copy_from_user()</tt>/<tt>copy_to_user()</tt>, are being moved 
into the KUnit suite.  Unlike other parts of the kernel, KASAN uses <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?component=Sanitizers&product=Memory%20Management&resolution=---">Bugzilla</a>
for its bugs; checking that will show lots of areas that still need
improvement in the tool, Konovalov said.
</p>

<p>
KASAN is "relatively fast"; the slowdown is on the order of 2x when it is
running, he said, and perhaps 3x when running in non-inline mode.  It has a
fairly substantial memory penalty though; it needs 1/8 of memory for the
shadow memory, 1/32 of memory for the quarantine, and the slab red zones
increase those allocations by 
around 1.5x.  Once KASAN is enabled, any kind of testing or fuzzing can
then be run on the kernel; whatever KASAN finds will be reported to the
kernel log.
</p>

<h4>More sanitizers</h4>

<p>
KASAN detects most of the memory corruption problems that can occur, but
there are other sanitizers available to detect other kinds of problems.
For example, the <a
href="https://google.github.io/kernel-sanitizers/KMSAN">Kernel Memory
Sanitizer</a> (KMSAN) detects the use of uninitialized memory in the
kernel; it can also detect information leaks of uninitialized memory across
security boundaries such as to user space or a device. Like KASAN,
KMSAN uses compiler instrumentation and shadow memory, though it tracks the
initialization state of the memory rather that its accessibility. KMSAN is not
in the mainline, but Konovalov hopes that it will be merged soon.
</p>

<p>
Data races are <a href="/Articles/877200/">detected</a> with the <a
href="https://google.github.io/kernel-sanitizers/KCSAN">Kernel Concurrency
Sanitizer</a> (KCSAN).  As with the others, it uses compiler instrumentation; in
this case, it installs "soft" watchpoints on data accesses.  The access is
stalled for a bit of time and the values at the location before and after
are compared to see if concurrent access is happening. That's a
simplification of how it is implemented, he said, but gives the general
flavor of it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/ubsan.html">Undefined
Behavior Sanitizer</a> (UBSAN), which really needs a "K" before its
acronym, he said.  It uses compiler instrumentation to test for various
kinds of code that use undefined behavior. For example, if an eight-byte
value is shifted by 64 bits, the result is undefined so UBSAN would flag it. 
</p>

<p>
Normally, sanitizers are run with test or fuzzing workloads, but it would
be nice to have some that can be run on production workloads to see what
kind of bugs can be found there.  That kind of testing might be on actual
production systems or might be on beta or "dog food" systems with real
workloads. There are some tools that can be used for that kind of testing,
he said.
</p>

<p>
The first is <a
href="https://google.github.io/kernel-sanitizers/KFENCE">Kernel
Electric-Fence</a> (KFENCE), which is a memory-corruption detector that
only works on slab memory.  It uses a probabilistic approach by sampling
some allocations, which get placed next to a protected guard page to detect
overruns.  Because it only affects a subset of the allocations, its impact
is lower, so it can be run in more real-world deployments.  Running it
across a fleet of systems makes it that much more likely to find bugs.
</p>

<p>
The KASAN <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#software-tag-based-kasan">mode
based on software tags</a>, which uses memory tags instead of shadow memory
to track memory status, is another possibility.  Its performance is similar
to that of KASAN, so it probably is not suitable for production, but its
memory use is much reduced compared to KASAN.  Since it is only available
for arm64 systems, it would make sense for fuzzing on Android systems, for
example.  It also paves the way for the KASAN <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#hardware-tag-based-kasan">hardware-tag
mode</a>.  
</p>

<p>
There is also the idea of using sanitizers as a way to mitigate various
flaws; since they can detect these kinds of problems, they can either panic
the system, which is safer from a security and robustness standpoint, or
perhaps mitigate the problematic access and allow the kernel to continue
running. 
There are, as yet, no CPUs that support the Arm Memory Tagging Extension
(MTE) that the KASAN hardware-tag mode uses, but there are plans for them.  It 
would move the memory-validity check for KASAN into the CPU directly, so it
would be fast, Konovalov said, which might mean that it could be used directly on
production systems.  
The RAM impact will be greatly reduced as well. 
</p>

<p>
But, since
there are no CPUs available, the performance penalty is not yet known, though
it is expected to be around 10% in the more accurate MTE sync mode; for
async mode, the penalty is expected to be near zero.  It remains to be seen
if people will be willing to take a 10% hit in production to catch these
kinds of errors.  He recommended his talk from LSS NA last year (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwMt0e_dC_Q">video</a>, <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IpICtHR1T3oHka858cx1dSNRu2XcT79-RCRPgzCuiRk/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>)
for those who are interested in finding out more about using hardware-tag
KASAN mode for mitigating memory corruptions.
</p>

<h4>Extending</h4>

<p>
If you take a standard fuzzer and run it on the kernel, you are probably
going to find the same bugs that everyone else is finding, he said.  The
same goes for the stock bug-finding tools; the same bugs are being found
over and over again using them.  So extending these tools, and changing the
workloads that are being run on the kernels, is a path toward finding novel
kernel bugs.
</p>

<p>
KASAN and KMSAN can be seen as more than just sanitizers, they
provide frameworks for tracking memory in various states and detecting when
memory is being used in an unexpected state.  So those tools could be
extended in 
various ways to catch other kinds of problems.
</p>

<p>
For example, the kernel's structure representing a packet (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19/source/include/linux/skbuff.h#L851"><tt>struct&nbsp;sk_buff</tt></a>)
has a <tt>skb_shared_info</tt> field placed at the end of the
structure.  KASAN cannot detect overflows into <tt>skb_shared_info</tt>
because it is all part of a single object.  One possible extension to KASAN
would be to place a small red zone before <tt>skb_shared_info</tt>, which
would require some work to ensure that the red zone was unpoisoned when the
socket buffer is (correctly) being accessed in full.
This kind of "intra-object overflow" is not being detected at all, but
could be added for various kernel data structures.  The socket buffer
overflow is not just a theoretical problem, as he used it in an <a
href="https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits/tree/master/CVE-2017-1000112">exploit</a>
for <a
href="https://xairy.io/articles/cve-2017-1000112">CVE-2017-1000112</a>,
which he found in the Linux UDP stack.
</p>

<p>
Another area to look into would be adding other kernel allocators to the
checking 
that KASAN does.  Right now, it does no checking of the per-CPU allocator,
but the allocator is used in many places in the kernel and especially in
the networking subsystem.  He showed two KASAN test cases that demonstrate
the lack of any checking for out-of-bounds accesses or use after free on
memory allocated that way.  Similarly, other kernel allocators could be
targeted, perhaps including some of the specialized Android allocators.
</p>

<p>
His final example has already been implemented.
A few years back, he was working on fuzzing the kernel's USB stack from the
point of view of an external device and needed to extend KMSAN to detect
information leaks to USB devices.  A malicious device needs some way to get
information out of the kernel in order to determine kernel addresses, so he
was interested in finding uninitialized kernel memory being copied to these
devices.  Once he added that detection, syzbot starting finding quite a few
of those kinds of flaws. 
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, Konovalov said that there are two paths toward finding more
kernel bugs: improving the fuzzers or improving the bug detectors.  It is
probably easier to improve the fuzzers at this point, but lots of people
are already working on that, while few are improving the bug-detection side.
Beyond just improving the existing detectors, there are opportunities to
create completely new ones that look for whole new classes of bugs, such as type
confusions or missing TLB flushes.  There are lots of areas open to
experimentation on ways to find more kernel bugs.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  the kernel&#x27;s structure representing a packet (struct sk_buff) has a skb_shared_info field placed at the end of </font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; the structure. KASAN cannot detect overflows into skb_shared_info because it is all part of a single object.</font><br>
<p>
The recent LWN article about flexible arrays (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/908817/">https://lwn.net/Articles/908817/</a>) explains why the following from skbuff.h is problematic:<br>
<p>
#if (65536/PAGE_SIZE + 1) &lt; 16<br>
#define MAX_SKB_FRAGS 16UL<br>
#else<br>
#define MAX_SKB_FRAGS (65536/PAGE_SIZE + 1)<br>
#endif<br>
extern int sysctl_max_skb_frags;<br>
<p>
/* return minimum truesize of one skb containing X bytes of data */<br>
#define SKB_TRUESIZE(X) ((X) +						\<br>
			 SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct sk_buff)) +	\<br>
			 SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info)))<br>
<p>
[ . . . ]<br>
<p>
/* This data is invariant across clones and lives at<br>
 * the end of the header data, ie. at skb-&gt;end.<br>
 */<br>
struct skb_shared_info {<br>
<p>
[ . . . ]<br>
<p>
/* must be last field, see pskb_expand_head() */<br>
	skb_frag_t	frags[MAX_SKB_FRAGS];<br>
};<br>
<p>
The frags array is indeed a flexible one, so its size is not known at compile time.   Undoubtedly in addition to their other recently noted problems, flexible arrays escape from KASAN.<br>

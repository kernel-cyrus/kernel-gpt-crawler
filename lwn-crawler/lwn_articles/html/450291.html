<h1>Seccomp filters: No clear path</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>July 7, 2011</br>
           </div>
<p>
Patches to expand the functionality of seccomp ("secure computing") have
been floating around 
for two years or more without making any real progress into the mainline.
There are a number of projects that are interested in using an expanded
seccomp, but the patches themselves seem to have run into a "catch-22"
situation. There are conflicting visions of how the feature should be
added, without a clear sense that any of the options will be acceptable
to all of the maintainers involved.  That leaves a useful
feature without a clear path into the kernel, which is undoubtedly
frustrating to some.  
</p>

<p>
We first <a href="/Articles/332974/">looked at seccomp sandboxing</a> a
little over two years ago, when Adam Langley posted patches that would
provide a way for a process to restrict the system calls that it (and
its children) could make.  The idea is to allow processes to sandbox themselves by choosing
which system calls are  
available, rather than being restricted to just the four hard-coded system calls
that the existing seccomp implementation allows (<tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>exit()</tt>, and
<tt>sigreturn()</tt>). The impetus behind Langley's patches was to provide
an easier mechanism for sandboxing processes in the Chromium web
browser&mdash;and to eventually remove the <a
href="/Articles/347547/">somewhat convoluted sandbox</a> that Chromium
currently uses on Linux.
</p>

<p>
At the time of that proposal, Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/332986/">suggested</a> that Ftrace-style filtering would
make the expanded seccomp much more useful.  That idea wasn't universally
hailed at the time, and the seccomp feature went mostly dormant until it
was <a href="/Articles/441232/">restarted</a> by Will Drewry back in April.
Drewry took Molnar's suggestions and implemented a version of seccomp that
would allow system calls to be enabled, disabled, or filtered with simple
boolean expressions (e.g. <tt>sys_read:&nbsp;(fd&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</tt>). 
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
While Molnar was pleased with the progress, he <a
href="/Articles/443099/">didn't think it went far enough</a> and suggested
that a perf-like interface be used instead of <tt>prctl()</tt>, which is
used by the existing seccomp.  He had some fairly wide-ranging ideas that
using perf events in a more active way could lead to better kernel security
solutions than the existing Linux Security Modules (LSM) approach
provides.  Once again, this idea was not universally popular.  The LSM
developers, in particular, were not enamored by that idea.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Drewry <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.ppc.embedded/43187">implemented
a proof of concept</a> along the lines of what Molnar had suggested.  That
led to <a href="/Articles/444745/">complaints</a> from a somewhat
surprising direction, as both Peter Zijlstra and Thomas Gleixner strongly
objected to perf being used in an active role.  Their responses didn't
leave room for any 
middle ground, with Zijlstra, who is one of the perf maintainers along with
Molnar, <a href="/Articles/444750/">saying</a> that he and Gleixner would
NAK "<q>any and all patches that extend perf/ftrace beyond the passive observing role</q>".
</p>

<p>
All of which led Drewry, who must be feeling a bit whipsawed at this point,
to return to the patchset that seemed to have the most support: using
Ftrace/perf-style filters, but maintaining the <tt>prctl()</tt> interface
that is currently used by seccomp.  Linus Torvalds had expressed some <a
href="/Articles/444751/">skepticism</a> that the feature would have any
real users, but Drewry <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1145681">outlined</a> how
it would be used by Chromium, and several other developers spoke up in
favor of expanding seccomp, saying that QEMU, Linux containers (LXC), and
others would use the feature.  Those endorsements, along with resolving
some other 
technical concerns, was enough for Torvalds to <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1146290">remove his
objection</a> to the feature.  But, as might be guessed, Molnar is still
not satisfied with the approach.
</p>

<p>
When Drewry <a href="/Articles/450389/">reposted</a> the patchset toward
the end of June, and <a href="/Articles/450390/">asked</a> what the next
steps were, Molnar <a href="/Articles/450392/">noted</a> that his concerns
were not being addressed: "<q>You are pushing the 'filter engine' approach currently, not the 
(much) more unified 'event filters' approach.</q>"  But Drewry is <a href="/Articles/450393/">trying
to find a balance</a> between the needs of the potential users, other 
maintainers, and Molnar's requests, which is somewhere between difficult
and impossible:
<div class="BigQuote">
Based on the support from potential API consumers, I believe there is
interest in this patch series, and I worry that just like with the
last two attempts in the last two years, this series will be relegated
to the lwn archives in anticipation of a future solution that uses
infrastructure that isn't quite ready.  I'm trying to approach a
problem that can be addressed today in a flexible, future-friendly
way, rather than try to open up a larger cross-kernel impacting patch
series that I'm unsure of exactly how to integrate sanely and don't
know that I can commit to doing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Molnar is <a href="/Articles/450394/">adamant</a> that the "filter
engine" approach is short-sighted, citing the diffstats of the various
implementations as evidence:
<div class="BigQuote">
Not doing it right because "it's too much work", especially as the 
trivial 'proof of concept' prototype already gave us something very 
promising that worked to a fair degree:
<pre>
       bitmask (2009):  6 files changed,  194 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)
 filter engine (2010): 18 files changed, 1100 insertions(+), 21 deletions(-)
 event filters (2011):  5 files changed,   82 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)
</pre>
are pretty hollow arguments to me. That diffstat sums up my argument 
of proper structure pretty well.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But, as Drewry <a href="/Articles/450412/">points out</a>, there is still a
lot of work to be done to get beyond the proof-of-concept and to a fully
fleshed-out solution.  Given that the approach has already received several
NAKs, doing all of that work has a very uncertain future.  Drewry would
like to see the feature be available soon, and is concerned that working on
the larger problem is likely to delay that significantly, if it can ever
get beyond the objections: "<q>If all the other work is a prerequisite
for system call restriction, I'll be very lucky to see anything this
calendar year assuming I can even write the patches in that time.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Molnar is <a href="/Articles/450416/">undeterred</a>, however, suggesting
that there is a path into the kernel through the tree
that he co-maintains:
<div class="BigQuote">
Do it properly generalized - as shown by the prototype patch.
    I can give you all help that is needed for that: we can host
    intermediate stages in -tip and we can push upstream step by
    step. You won't have to maintain some large in-limbo set of
    patches. 95% of the work you've identified will be warmly
    welcome by everyone and will be utilized well beyond sandboxing! 
    That's not a bad starting position to get something controversial 
    upstream: most of the crazy trees are 95% crazy.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The problem, of course, is that the 5% is the piece that Drewry and others
are most interested in seeing (i.e. the system call restrictions for
sandboxing) in the kernel.  So, what Molnar seems to be offering is a
fairly sizable chunk of work that could, in the end, still leave the
"interesting" part out in the cold.  Molnar may be confident that he can
overcome the objections from Zijlstra and Gleixner, but Drewry can hardly
be as sanguine.  He <a href="/Articles/450422/">describes</a> the problem
as he sees it:
<div class="BigQuote">
It seems like a catch-22.  There's not a perfectly clear path forward,
and anything that looks like the perf-style proof of concept will be
NACK'd by other maintainers.  While I believe we could lift perf up
off its foundation and create a shared location for storing perf
events and ftrace events so that they will be inherited the same way
(currently nack'd by linus) and walked the same way (kinda), the
syscall interface couldn't currently be shared (also nack'd by perf),
and creating a new one is possible modeled on the perf one, but it's
also unclear what the ABI should be for a generic filtering system.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Both Zijlstra and Gleixner have been absent from the most recent
discussion, so it's a little hard to guess what their thoughts are.  In the
absence of any kind of posting softening their stances, though, it would be
a bad idea to believe that they have changed their minds.

<p>
It's a problem that we have seen before, where a new feature is, to some
extent, held hostage to requests that a larger problem be solved.  The
problem was 
<a href="/Articles/357805/#rework">discussed</a> at the 2009 Kernel Summit,
where there was agreement that those requests should be advisory in nature,
rather than demands.  In this case, Molnar is not really demanding that
the bigger task be done, just that he is uninterested in taking the code
via the -tip tree unless it solves the larger problem.

<p>
It is unclear where things go from here.  Drewry said that he would look at
trying to do things Molnar's way ("<q>but if my only chance of any form of this being
ACK'd is to write it such that it shares code with perf and has a
shiny new ABI, then I'll queue up the work for when I can start trying
to tackle it</q>"), but it may be a ways off.  In the meantime, there
are various projects interested in using the feature.

<p>
If falling back to the bitmask version of the feature solves enough of the
problem for those projects, there is the possibility of trying to get that
into the kernel via another tree (e.g. the security tree).  There would
undoubtedly be objections from Molnar, but if enough users lined up behind
it, that might be a reasonable approach.  It would create an ABI that would need
to be maintained going forward, which is one of Molnar's objections, but it
would solve problems for Chromium and others.

<p>
Steven Rostedt <a href="/Articles/450427/">suggested</a> adding the seccomp
expansion as a
discussion item for the Kernel Summit in October, which might provide a
path forward.  It's likely that most or all of the interested parties will
be there (unlike the Linux Security Summit that will be held with Plumbers
in September, which was 
suggested as an alternative).  While a face-to-face discussion could be
helpful, it might be a stretch to believe that the disagreement between active
vs. passive perf could be resolved that way. On the other hand, it could
lead to some kind of decree about the proper direction from
Torvalds. <i>That</i> could go a long way toward resolving the issue.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's also worth noting that the maintainers of both vsftpd and openssh stepped up and said they wanted this support too. This is a very simple yet powerful and long-overdue facility that many people would like to see in the Linux kernel.<br>
It's frustrating to see an accurate chronicle of Will's struggles. He has been very accommodating (including the pain of various dead-ends at the behest of random people).<br>

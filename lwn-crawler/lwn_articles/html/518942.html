<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 10, 2012</br>
           </div>
Those who like to complain about udev, systemd, and their current
maintainers have had no shortage of company recently as the result of a
somewhat incendiary discussion on the linux-kernel mailing list.
Underneath the flames, 
though, lie some important issues: who decides what constitutes appropriate
behavior for kernel device drivers, how strong is our commitment to
backward compatibility, and which tasks are best handled in the kernel
without calling out to user space?
<p>
The udev process is responsible for a number of tasks, most
initiated as the result of events originating in the kernel.  It responds
to device creation events by making device nodes, setting permissions, and,
possibly, running a setup program.  It also handles module loading requests
and firmware requests from the kernel.  So, for example, when a driver
calls <tt>request_firmware()</tt>, that request is turned into an event
that is passed to the udev process.  Udev will, in response, locate the
firmware file, read its contents, and pass the data back to the kernel.
The driver will get its firmware blob without having to know anything about
how things are organized in user space, and everybody should be happy.
<p>
Back in January, the udev developers decided to implement a stricter notion
of sequencing between various types of events.  No events for a specific
device, they decided, would be processed until the process of loading the
driver module for that device had completed.  Doing things this way makes
it easier for them to keep things straight in user space and to avoid
attempting operations that the kernel is not yet ready to handle.  But it
also created problems for some types of drivers.  In particular, if a
driver tries to load device firmware during the module initialization
process, things will appear to lock up.  Udev sees that the module is not
yet initialized, so it will hold onto the firmware request and everything
stops.  Udev developer Kay Sievers <a
href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg185742.html">warned the
world</a> about this problem last January:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We might need to work around that in the current udev for now, but
	these drivers will definitely break in future udev versions.
	Userspace, these days, should not be in charge of papering over
	obvious kernel bugs like this.
</div>
<p>
The problem with this line of reasoning, of course, is that one person's
kernel bug is another's user-space problem.  Firmware loading at module
initialization time has worked just fine for a long time — if one ignores
little problems like built-in modules, booting with <tt>init=/bin/sh</tt>,
and other situations where proper user-space support is not present when
the <tt>request_firmware()</tt> call takes place.  What matters most is
that it works for a normal
bootstrap on a typical distribution install.  The udev sequencing change
breaks that: users of a number of
distributions have been reporting that things no longer work properly with
newer versions of udev installed.
<p>
Breaking currently-running systems is something the kernel development
community tries hard to avoid, so it is not surprising that there was some
disagreement over the appropriateness of the udev changes.  Even so,
various kernel developers were trying to work around the problems when
Linus threw <a href="/Articles/518945/">a bit of a tantrum</a>, saying that
the problem lies with udev and needs to be fixed there.  He did not get the
response that he was hoping for.
<p>
Kay <a href="/Articles/518946/">answered</a> that, despite the problem
reports, udev had not yet been fixed, saying "<q>we still haven't
wrapped our head around how to fix it/work around it.</q>"  He pointed
out that things don't really hang, they just get "slow" while waiting for a
30-second timeout to expire.  And he reiterated his position that the real
problem lies in the kernel and should be fixed there.  Linus was <a
href="/Articles/518948/">unimpressed</a>, but, since he does not maintain
udev, there is not a whole lot that he can do directly to solve the
problem.
<p>
Or, then again, maybe there is.  One possibility raised by a few developers
was pulling udev into the kernel source tree and maintaining it as part of
the kernel development process.  There was a certain amount of support for this idea,
but nobody actually stepped up to take responsibility for maintaining udev
in that environment.  Such a move would represent a fork of a significant
package that would take it in a new direction; current plans are to
integrate udev more thoroughly with systemd. 
The current udev developers thus seem unlikely to support putting udev in
the kernel tree.  Getting distributors to adopt the kernel's version of
udev could also prove to be a challenge.  In general, it is the sort of
mess that is best avoided if at all possible.
<p>
An alternative is to simply short out udev for firmware loading
altogether.  That is, in fact, what has been done; the 3.7 kernel will
include a patch (from Linus) that causes firmware loading to be done
directly from the kernel without involving user space at all.  If the
kernel is unable to find the firmware file in the expected places (under
<tt>/lib/firmware</tt> and variants) it will fall back to sending a request
to udev in the usual manner.  But if the kernel-space load attempt works,
then udev will never even know that the firmware request was made.
<p>
This appears to be a solution that is workable for everybody involved.
There is nothing particularly tricky about firmware loading, so few
developers seem to have concerns about doing it directly from the kernel.
Kay <a href="/Articles/518951/">supports the idea</a> as well, saying
"<q>I would absolutely like to get udev entirely out of the sick game of
firmware loading</q>".  The real proof will be in how well the concept
works once the 3.7 kernel starts seeing widespread testing, but the initial
indications are that there will not be a lot of problems.  If things stay
that way, it would not be surprising to see the direct firmware loading
patch backported to the stable series — once it has gained a few amenities
like user-configurable paths.
<p>
One of the biggest challenges in kernel design can be determining what
should be done in the kernel and what should be pushed out to user space.
The user-space solution is often appealing; it can simplify kernel code and
make it easier for others to implement their own policies.  But an overly
heavy reliance on user space can lead to just the sort of difficulty seen
with firmware loading.  In this case, it appears, the problem was better
solved in the kernel; fortunately, it appears to have been a relatively
easy one for the kernel to take back without causing compatibility
problems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

No, the change to udev excludes firmware loading from dependency ordering requirements regardless of the kernel version. If a newer kernel happens to load the firmware itself, then the firmware loading request won't reach udev in the first place.<br>

I'd support a fork (or rewrite) of udev:<br>
<p>
- There's no reason for it to be included in systemd.<br>
<p>
- Since it was included in systemd, the location of the daemon seems to move around, breaking our small Linux appliance (it uses udev, not systemd).<br>

- The udev rules format is braindead.  Whoever wrote it had never heard of parsers.<br>

I more might be misunderstanding things but they seem as if they perform complementary actions. Both are event driven. Both can even perform similar actions (say, creating mount points).<br>
Regarding syntax, perhaps it would be possible to rewrite the udev rules into the systemd format? I haven't actually tried doing that yet so I don't know if it would be possible, especially with the complicated matching schemes of udev. <br>

      <blockquote>
Since it was included in systemd, the location of the daemon seems to move around

This actually first happened in udev 174, which predates the systemd merge. No compatibility symlink was left behind and no rationale was given for the move, which contravenes long-standing Unix policy anyway (moving a daemon into /lib/udev? Total number of other daemons in /lib: zero.)

This article doesn't actually explain what the problem is. Instead it dances around the issue.<br>
<p>
It all starts from the udev serialization. <br>
"Udev ensures full dependency resolution between parent and child events. Parent events have to finish the event handling and have to return, before child event handlers are started. We need to ensure such things so that (among other things) disk events have finished their operations before the partition events are started, so they can rely and access their fully set up parent devices." (Kay Sievers)<br>
<p>
<p>
The problem is that same principle was applied to firmware. That is, firmware loading was blocked until parent module completes initialization. But this rule does not make sense for the firmware. There is no case where successful loading of firmware when requested would cause any kind of problem. (Hint - cases like "keys locked inside the car" have better solutions.) <br>
<p>
Despite that Kay Sievers has refused to acknowledge that the problem is in the udev and insisted that the bugs are in the kernel. So the device developers were forced to start rewriting their drivers in a way that avoids the udev blocking. Mind you, these drivers were written to all requirement of the kernel driver-model, they were working perfectly well, before udev changed the rules. Now they had to introduce asynchronous behavior, so that they can finish a fake initializations early and then do the real one when the firmware is loaded. Since the real initialization is now asynchronous it introduces problem with the initialization of the dependent&amp;sibling modules (that may also do fake and async initialization). There was mentioned even the possibility of designing new core functionality to avoid race conflicts for the now parallel initializations, that used to be serialized. (Think of micro-kernel messaging issues).<br>
<p>
In short, it opened a can of worms. Modules were fixed, but that caused regressions for some devices, then new hacks were introduced that repeated the cycle again and again. It made the drivers a lot more complicated and fragile. All this for no real benefit at all.<br>
<p>
Of course the intentional blocking of firmware loading by udev is not the only problem when loading firmware. The root of the problems is that userland program have to pipe the firmware into the kernel. This makes loading slow (dependent on scheduler and other factors, udev included). Also it won't work on suspend/resume because kernel modules are resumed before userland.<br>
To solve these issues, asynchronous loading of firmware was introduced. But it didn't solve them, it just made things worse.<br>

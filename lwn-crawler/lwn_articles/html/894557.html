The kernel's "direct map" makes the entirety of a system's physical memory
available in the kernel's virtual address space.  Normally, huge pages are used for
this mapping, making it relatively efficient to access.  Increasingly,
though, there is a need to carve some pages out of the direct map; this
splits up those huge pages and makes the system as a whole less efficient.
During a memory-management session at the 
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM),
Mike Rapoport led a session on direct-map fragmentation and how it might be
avoided.
<p>
Rapoport started by saying that the direct-map fragmentation problem is
specific to the x86 architecture at this point; some other architectures
cannot fragment their direct map at all.  There are a number of activities
that can lead to direct-map fragmentation, including <a
href="/Articles/892743/">allocations for BPF programs</a>, various <a
href="/Articles/865256/">secret-memory mechanisms</a>, and virtualization
technologies like <a
href="https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf">SNP</a>
and <a
href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html">TDX</a>.
Other changes envisioned for the future, including the <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20201120202426.18009-1-rick.p.edgecombe@intel.com/">permission
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> API</a>

 and using <a href="/Articles/894531/">protection
keys supervisor (PKS) to protect page tables</a>, will make things
worse. As more subsystems carve 
pieces out of the direct map, the performance of the system will decline;
this is an outcome worth avoiding.
<p>
Rapoport's proposal is to coalesce these various uses into a single region
of memory as a way of minimizing the fragmentation they create.  Once a
huge page has been split for carved-out memory, further requests for such
memory should be satisfied from the same huge page, if possible.  To that
end, he suggests adding a new GFP flag (<tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt>) so that
normal page-allocator calls can be used to obtain memory that has been
removed from the direct map.
Callers using this flag would have to map the
allocated memory in whatever way makes sense for their use case.  A new
migration type (<tt>MIGRATE_UNMAPPED</tt>) would  be added to
prevent this memory from being accidentally migrated back into
direct-mapped memory.    He has
posted <a href="/ml/linux-mm/20220127085608.306306-1-rppt@kernel.org/">a
patch set</a> implementing this idea in a prototype form; it "kind of
works", he said.
<p>
Michal Hocko said that using the page allocator might not be the best
approach; it will be adding overhead to highly optimized fast paths for a
rare case.  Mel Gorman agreed that using the page allocator was overkill,
creating a special case for a single user.  Rapoport's addition of a
separate migration type, he added, would end up fragmenting memory anyway
because those pages cannot be moved.
Rapoport answered that, in a long-running machine, direct-map fragmentation
is inevitable, leading Gorman to answer that he does not want to see the
extra complexity added to the page allocator to address a problem that will
still happen.
<p>
An alternative, Rapoport said, would be to have a separate allocation
mechanism that sits next to the page allocator.  In this case, each user
would have their own cache, which is a less attractive option.  But Gorman
replied that migration types are not free either; each new one adds a set
of linked lists and increases the size of the page-block bitmap.  A better
solution, he said, might be a special slab cache.
<p>
David Hildenbrand said that, in his role working on memory hotplug, he
hates memory that is not movable; Rapoport's proposal would create more
unmovable memory and make the problem worse.  Rapoport said that his patch
tries to avoid movable zones when performing unmapped allocations, which
should minimize the problem.  Hocko repeated, though, that the page
allocator is not the best place to make this type of allocation; users
"count every CPU cycle" for memory allocations, and any extra overhead
there is unwelcome.  It would be better to build something like a slab
allocator on top of the page allocator, he said.
<p>
At the end of the session, Rapoport said that he would try to create some
sort of slab-like solution.  Vlastimil Babka cautioned that the existing
slab allocator cannot be used for BPF programs; the slab allocator hands
out objects of the same size, but every BPF program is different.  Rapoport
concluded by saying he wasn't sure how to solve all of the problems, but
would be making the attempt soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Maybe slab can be used for bpf_prog_pack allocator? it allocates bpf_prog_pack_size at once.<br>

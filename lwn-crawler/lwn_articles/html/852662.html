<h1>Running code within another process's address space</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 16, 2021</br>
           </div>
One of the key resources that defines a process is its address space — the
set of mappings that determines what any specific memory address means
within that process.  An address space is normally private
to the process it belongs to, but there are situations where one process
needs to make changes to another process's memory; an interactive debugger
would be one case in point.  The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>
system call makes such changes possible, but it is slow and not always easy
to use, so there has been a longstanding quest for better alternatives.
One possibility, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210414055217.543246-1-avagin@gmail.com/"><tt>process_vm_exec()</tt></a>
from Andrei Vagin, was recently posted for review.
<p>
In truth, alternatives to <tt>ptrace()</tt> already exist for some tasks.
The <a href="/Articles/405346/">cross-memory attach system calls</a> were <a
href="/Articles/465066/">merged for 3.2</a> in 2011 as <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html"><tt>process_vm_readv()</tt>
and <tt>process_vm_writev()</tt></a>.  As their names would suggest, they
allow one process to read from and write to another process's memory.
Those system calls satisfy many needs, but fall short when even more
invasive access is needed to another process's address space.  Sometimes,
it seems, there is no alternative to running code <i>within</i> the target
address space.
<p>
Vagin's patch set gives a couple of examples of where this access would be
useful.  User-mode kernels, such as <a
href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode Linux</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>, have to be able to
intercept system calls made by a sandboxed process and, possibly, run them
in the address space of that process.  The <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">Checkpoint/Restore in User space</a>
project needs to reach deeply within a process to extract all of the
information needed to checkpoint it.  Both use cases are currently handled
with <tt>ptrace()</tt> but, once again, better and faster alternatives are
wanted.
<p>
The alternative proposed by Vagin is a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int process_vm_exec(pid_t pid, struct sigcontext uctx, unsigned long flags,
    			siginfo_t siginfo, sigset_t *sigmask, size_t sizemask);
</pre>
<p>
A successful call will cause the calling process's address space to be
changed to that of the process identified by <tt>pid</tt>.  The cover
letter notes that using a <a href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd</a> might be
preferable; that would make this system call inconsistent with
<tt>process_vm_readv()</tt> and <tt>process_vm_writev()</tt>, though.  The
values in <tt>uctx</tt> are used to load the processor registers (including
the instruction pointer) before resuming execution in the new address space
— an important step, since using the previous instruction pointer from the old
address space is unlikely to yield satisfactory results in the new address
space.
<p>
If <tt>flags</tt> is zero, <tt>process_vm_exec()</tt> will change the
address space, then resume execution as indicated by <tt>uctx</tt>; that
execution will continue until the process either makes a system call or
receives a signal.  Either way, the old address space will be restored and
<tt>process_vm_exec()</tt> will return to the caller.  The <tt>siginfo</tt>
structure will describe the event that interrupted execution in the other
address space; if it's a system call, <tt>siginfo</tt> will be made to look
as if a <tt>SIGSYS</tt> signal had been received.
<p>
If, instead, <tt>flags</tt> contains <tt>PROCESS_VM_EXEC_SYSCALL</tt>, the
purpose of the call is to invoke a system call within the target process's
address space.  In this case, <tt>uctx</tt> should contain the system call
number and arguments in the appropriate registers, as would be the case for
a real system call.  The address space will be switched for the duration of
the system call, then restored before returning to the caller.
<p>
This patch series was posted as a proof of concept with the idea of getting
comments on the proposed API.  Jann Horn was quick to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez0jfsS=gKN0Vo_VS2EvvMBvEr+QNz0vDKPeSAzsrsRwPQ@mail.gmail.com/">respond</a>
that the proposed system call does not appear to fit the stated use cases
well; it is 
too much for one and not enough for the other.  For the case of running
code within a different address space (as systems like User-mode Linux do),
he suggested, creating a whole new 
process is overkill; it might be better to have a system call that allows
the construction of new address spaces separately.  For the
checkpoint/restore case, instead, there may still be a need to access
resources within a process beyond its address space, though he didn't say
which resources those might be.  Vagin <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YHdoRAJb9VlZ5lSu@gmail.com/">responded</a> that a
relatively generic system call seemed better than a whole set of
specialized ones, even if the generic alternative is not a perfect fit to
all use cases.
<p>
Florian Weimer did <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87blahb1pr.fsf@oldenburg.str.redhat.com/">have
another resource in mind</a>, though, that would be useful for the the GNU
C library.  There is a difference between how Linux implements <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html"><tt>setuid()</tt></a>
and what POSIX requires: Linux only changes the credentials for the calling
thread, while POSIX specifies that it must change the credentials for all
of the threads running in a process.  Currently, glibc implements POSIX
semantics on Linux by 
sending signals to all threads so that they can all call <tt>setuid()</tt>
together, which is less than ideal.  It would be much
nicer to just be able to call <tt>setuid()</tt> within the context of each
thread without 
actually interrupting the threads.  Such a feature could also be useful for
implementing memory barriers, he said.
<p>
There is clearly some tension here between creating a feature that would be
useful in some contexts and trying to solve a larger and more complex
problem.  In such cases, developers must pick their path carefully; trying
to do too much is a good way to ensure that nothing actually gets far
enough to land in the mainline kernel.  So what will happen with
<tt>process_vm_exec()</tt> is far from clear at this point; it may
eventually find its way to acceptance, but it could change form
considerably before that happens.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The <a href="http://www.rampant.org/doors/index.html">Linux port</a> was only “alpha quality”, and sadly work on it seems to have stopped in 2003.
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doors_(computing)">Doors facility</a> needs both (1) kernel support and (2) a non-trivial user-space library. Door servers need that library to manage a thread pool in ways that almost require tight integration with the threads library. This is much easier when one organization produces both the kernel and the core libraries than in the Linux community.
<p>
(Full disclosure: I created that Wikipedia article.)

Remote system calls often need parameters (both in and out) in memory. If the target task is running, how do you guarantee with PROCESS_VM_EXEC_SYSCALL that any memory changes you make aren&#x27;t overwritten by the running task? You won&#x27;t be able to use the stack for example. Would you have to remote-sycall an mmap/munmap to allocate dedicated memory for your parameters?<br>

Thanks for your nice article! The `process_vm_exec` system call is interesting, and I get some questions while reading the article.<br>
<p>
1. If I understand correctly, the current `process_vm_exec` can only execute code that is already in the target process&#x27;s address space, which could be inconvenient for tasks such as inspecting the address space content.<br>
In other words, the calling process needs to inject the code to the target (perhaps by `process_vm_writev`) before it invokes `process_vm_exec` to execute the injected code.<br>
<p>
Or does `process_vm_exec` provide some mechanisms to &quot;bring&quot; its own code to the switched address space?<br>
<p>
2.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; that execution will continue until the **process** either makes a system call or receives a signal.</font><br>
<p>
Is this **process** the calling process or the target process? Or both?<br>
<p>
Will the target process (and threads in the target process) pause its execution upon the system call?<br>
If so, how could the calling process resume the target&#x27;s execution?<br>
If not, the calling process could miss some system calls made by the target, right?<br>
<p>
3. I think things will be complicated when there are multiple threads in the calling process.<br>
For example, when one thread calls `process_vm_exec` to switch the address space, other threads will run in the &quot;wrong address space&quot; and fail.<br>
<p>
Sorry for asking so many questions.<br>

Umm, the target of course. When the target does [ make a syscall / gets a signal ], the system call returns, as described in the text. It obviously cannot do that if the caller continues execution in any way.<br>

Thanks for your reply. :) But I find that it&#x27;s more complex than I thought earlier, and I am getting more confused.<br>
<p>
It may be helpful to confirm what the caller will do during `process_vm_exec`; here are two possibilities:<br>
<p>
1) the caller blocks until the target [makes a syscall / gets a signal];<br>
2) the caller resumes execution by jumping to the IP specified in `uctx` in the target&#x27;s address space; and the caller somehow gets back to the original context in the original address space when the target [makes a syscall / gets a signal].<br>
<p>
For 1), emmm, there seems to be no `exec` effect since the original address space is restored when `process_vm_exec` returns; the caller simply blocks to wait for the target&#x27;s syscall/signal.<br>
<p>
For 2), a new control flow seems to have emerged after `process_vm_exec`, and the new control flow is terminated (at any time) upon the target&#x27;s syscall/signal.<br>

I would rephrase this:<br>
<p>

The target process is used only to grub its address space. process_vm_exec doesn&#x27;t stop it and doesn&#x27;t change its state (registers, signals, fpu, etc).<br>
<p>
There are a few examples, I think they can help to understand how this works:<br>

Surely it should be called process_vm_exec*v*? :)<br>

I would have thought that the correct way to solve &quot;implementing POSIX semantics for setuid() purely in userspace is somewhere between tricky and impossible&quot; (the glibc machinery for it is pretty gnarly) is &quot;implement a new kernel syscall that provides the whole-process semantics&quot;. The kernel is in a much better position to be able to do that than userspace ever will be. I&#x27;m mildly surprised that nobody&#x27;s ever had a go at it.<br>

As someone working on a process sandbox/simulator/emulator &lt;<a href="http://shadow.github.io/">http://shadow.github.io/</a>&gt;, this looks super-exciting! We&#x27;re in the process now of moving from LD_PRELOAD-based interposition to ptrace. This simplifies a lot of things and is more robust, but is a significant performance hit. AFAICT we&#x27;d be able to switch over from ptrace to this new API without much work.<br>

It is indeed nifty to have such &quot;immediate signal&quot; facility within same address space. And assuming it will be used with sigmask set to block everything, it looks robust. Even delivering another such &quot;signal&quot; when one is already running (assuming the caller provides the stack in both cases which seems reasonable anyways) would work. I assume things like backtraces would work too, as this facility could use same sigreturn trampoline stuff as real signals.<br>
<p>
One particularly nice feature of this is that it is entirely compatible with all kinds of libraries. I.e. today libraries are essentially unable to use signals because it is ~impossible to arbitrate between libraries who is using which signal number. When there are no signal numbers or any state (e.g. altstack, sigaction) involved in first place, it looks like there no any kinds compatibility trouble.<br>
<p>
Another thing that would be nifty is being able to somehow specify not saving/restoring huge simd states to enable cheaper or more perf-sensitive usages of this facility (e.g. garbage collectors might choose to use it too), and to save stack. It seems inevitable that safe usage of this facility requires caller to allocate stack for each thread&#x27;s &quot;remote call&quot; and not having to bother about simd registers would save nontrivial number of bytes.<br>

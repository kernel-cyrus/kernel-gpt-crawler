</div>
The kernel's handling of task and memory placement has been the subject of
a lot of discussion and development in recent years.  The pace has slowed
for the last few development cycles, but there is still work to be done in
this area as can be seen by the discussion on the topic that was held at
the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit.

The session, led by Rik van Riel, Peter Zijlstra, and Mel Gorman, started
with the question: lots of code has been merged, what should happen next?
Peter made the observation that, while the code is in the kernel, few
people have actually tried to take advantage of it to improve NUMA
performance.  What is most needed now is user feedback 
on how things are working and what could be improved.
<p>
Davidlohr Bueso said that, on his systems, he can still get much better
performance from a carefully hand-tuned configuration than with the
automatic NUMA placement code.  Rik added that, as far as he can tell,
things work close to optimally on four-node systems, but tend to fall apart
on systems with more nodes than that.  Mel asked why that might be; there
was some speculation that the costs of page hinting (tracking who is using
each page of memory so that it can be moved to the right node) might be
responsible, or perhaps the more complex topology of larger NUMA systems is
not being handled well.  But it seems that nobody really knows what the
problems are.
<p>
Mel said that truly understanding NUMA performance issues requires the
collection of a lot of data.  But that data collection is expensive, to the
point that it disrupts the workload under study.  It's hard enough for him
to run his tests; he hasn't really found a good way for others to do it
yet.  It seems that Rik, Peter, and Mel each have their own way of
measuring NUMA performance; they haven't done much talking among themselves
in this area.  That is, it was suggested, actually a good thing; each
developer is able to find different problems with his particular approach.
<p>
Rik noted that, while the NUMA code tries hard to keep anonymous pages on
the same node as the processes using them, the same care is not yet applied
to page cache pages.  His question was: should it be?  It is not clear that
localization of the page cache would lead to better performance overall;
Mel said that this area is pretty much ignored for now.
<p>
Johannes Weiner said that a node-local page cache allocation policy might
not make sense.  If the system tries hard to allocate those pages locally,
it could do so at the expense of pushing other useful pages out.  At that
point, the kernel is buying local pages at the expense of forcing disk I/O
for other needed pages â€” probably not a good bargain.  Currently, page
reclaim is strongly tied to nodes, so some nodes can reclaim heavily while
old pages languish on others.  So, he said, it might be good to force some
page aging on all nodes even if there isn't memory pressure everywhere.
Then interleaving page cache pages across all nodes might be able to
increase memory utilization and reduce the aging of useful pages, a win
even if it results in more cross-node traffic.
<p>
There were complaints that processes communicating over network sockets
should be grouped onto the same node, but that doesn't happen now.  There
is seemingly a bit of a disconnect with the networking developers on how
that kind of grouping should be done.  There would also be value in moving
network-oriented processes onto the NUMA node that holds the network
adapter they are using, but there is no I/O awareness in the NUMA code at
all currently.  Improving the integration of networking and NUMA placement
is not going to be an easy task; it will likely involve carrying NUMA
information through many layers of the network stack.
<p>

The session wound down without a lot in the way of hard conclusions.  It
seems clear that there is still a lot of work to be done in the area of
NUMA placement.

Memory pressure on one node causes disk I/O, even though there is space on another node? That's seems silly. Why not at least use the memory on the other node as a form of swap, you can always move it back later. Or maybe zcache to make even more effective use of memory.<br>

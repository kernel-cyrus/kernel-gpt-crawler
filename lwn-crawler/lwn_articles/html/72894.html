<div class="ArticleText">
The question of whether <tt>invalidate_mmap_range()</tt> should be exported
to non-GPL modules was discussed here <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/70926/">last week</a>.  There still has been
no (public) resolution of the question as of this writing, but the
discussion has progressed somewhat.  This issue may give some hints as to
how other export requests may be viewed in the future.
<p>
Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/72899/">posted</a> two criteria which
should be used in considering the request.  The first is: does the export
make sense from a technical point of view?  In other words, is the ability
to clear page table entries which point at the page cache a legitimate
feature for filesystems to want?  The consensus answer here appears to be
"yes"; distributed filesystems, in particular, will need this capability.
<p>
Andrew also noted that the technical question really should be the only one
that matters.  If there is a valid technical reason for filesystems to use
that function, it should be exported to them.  In the real world, however,
a second question must also be considered: is IBM's proprietary GPFS
filesystem, being the module driving the proposed export change, 
a derived product of the kernel or not?  Here there is less of a consensus.
<p>
IBM's claim is that GPFS was developed under AIX and simply ported to
Linux; it is thus an independent development and clearly not derived from
the Linux kernel.  Critics point to the large, BSD-licensed layer of glue
code which is required to make GPFS actually work with Linux; this layer,
they say, shows that GPFS does so much messing around with kernel internals
(rather than using the existing, exported interface) that it must be a
derived product.  Interestingly, IBM supporters also point to the large
glue layer.  If GPFS were truly derived from the kernel, they say, there
would be no need for a large impedance-matching layer.  
<p>

Without access to the GPFS source, it is going to be hard for any
independent party to make a real determination on the status of GPFS.  In
the end, however, somebody is going to have to make a decision anyway.  The
odds would appear to favor IBM getting what it wants in this case.  But a
clear message is being sent: the kernel developers are increasingly
suspicious of (and hostile to) changes which make life easier for vendors
of closed-source modules.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      To me it seems the GPL zealots are using the same arguments against this kind of module as SCO is towards RCU: If it was developped for Linux it is a derivative of Linux  and must thus be distributed under GPL. Since RCU was developed for Unix it is a derivative work of Unix and must be treated according to the contract between the Unix licensee and SCO.<p>I don't know what the lawyers say, but I can't see that a function not contanining any direct code from Linux or Unix can be a derivative work. Only the combination between the function and Linux or Unix can be a derivative work.<br>

      There's a fairly fundamental difference;<p>IBM is going to Linus and saying the equivalent of: &quot;Please make these changes to your code, so that my proprietary kernel-module will work under Linux.&quot;<p>As far as I know, noone has ever approached SCO and asked them to change their code in order to make something or other involving Linux or free software in general possible.<p>A program that can be compiled and run under any of half a dozen oses is obviously not a derivative of any of them.<p>A module that is hacked up in a way (with a bsd compatibility layer and whatnot) that it can ONLY work with one spesific OS (Linux) and ONLY if that OS chooses to incorporate changes making the module run is a lot more intimately tied to the OS.<p>

      There are morally differences. But even though the interface is changed and the system can only run on Linux the filesystem itself is not anymore a derivative work of Linux than RCU is a derivative of Unix.<p>Ofcourse Linux + the filesystem is a kind derivative work as if Linux + Nvidia driver. If distributing &lt;Linux&gt;+&lt;Nvidia driver&gt; is legal then is <br>&lt;your own version of Linux&gt;+&lt;what ever file system module you want to make&gt;.<p>You can't have legal decitions based on &quot;how integrated it is&quot;, &quot;if it was<br>written for other os'es.&quot; It must be either or. And in the end a judge must decide on where the line is.<p>The decision I would want was that you can do anything to the kernel you want - including changes to the interfaces. You then have to destribute that under GPL. But on that product you can load whatever module you want.<br>If that can't be seen as within the GPL, no distributing binary modules along with the kernel is within the GPL. I can't see that a judge can decide &quot;in between&quot;.<p>I wish we could have a case going to court such we can get this decided. The worst thing is that we don't know what is what. If it is decided that binary modules isn't ok, we can always make userspace drivers. I am pretty sure that in that case RedHat will put such an interface into their Linux even if Linus wont because people _need_ non-GPL drivers (to have them in userspace would also greatly impact stability.)

      <i>IBM is going to Linus and saying the equivalent of: "Please make these changes to your code ...</i>

<p>I need to correct a significant misconception here:  IBM is not going to Linus.  IBM is going to (the addressee's of Paul McKenney's email) the nebulous Linux kernel community, the nebulous Linux 2.6 kernel community, and Andrew Morton.  And it (the Linux kernel) is not Linus' code.

<p>I don't believe it was mentioned in the articles whose decision it was to include the original EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL into the Linus/Andrew tree or whose decision it was to change it to EXPORT_SYMBOL, or if one or the other other was a complete accident.

      The concerned Linux developers don't claim any right in the GPFS, but in the  <br>Linux+GPFS combination. It is the difference with SCO claims.

      I'm more inclined to stick to moral/sanity arguments rather than legal  <br>ones (perhaps because IANAL?).  From a moral perspective, IBM has asked  <br>nicely, they've played fair elsewhere, and what they're asking for doesn't  <br>inconvenience anybody else. So, what is lost by agreeing?  Notice that the  <br>&quot;they've played fair elsewhere&quot; clause invalidates the argument that  <br>thousands of hardware companies could now ask for silly glue.  <br>  <br>Also, I agree 100% with their argument that it isn't a derived work (in  <br>the rational sense, I've given up trying to make judgements about derived  <br>works in the legal sense since it is just too counterintuitive).  The  <br>compatibility layer clearly shows it is a work for another platform which  <br>was ported to Linux.  To me, and the dictionary seems to agree, derived  <br>means 'comes from', not 'is intimately tied to'.  Often those are the  <br>same, but here they're not.

      As I posted last week, I think this discussion is missing one item that needs <br>considered.  Last week the article mentioned that the person requesting the <br>change to EXPORT from GPL_EXPORT was none other than the person <br>that originally proposed the patch.  Therefore, it obviously has his permission <br>and that isn't in question.  Also, his code is GPLed as part of the kernel and <br>naturally gets access to the rest of the kernel as such.  He's free to <br>dual-license it elsewise to whoever, including proprietary-ware folks as it's his <br>code.  However, what of the code HE calls?  How much of a say should <br>THOSE authors get?  What about code THEY call?  How far do such things <br>permission questions need to revert? <br> <br>At that time, I hadn't taken a look at the request or the patch.  I now have. <br>I'm no kernel hacker by far, but the patch seems reasonably self-coherent.  <br>Other than the header and export definitions, naturally in their respective <br>files, everything applies as a single linear patch to a single file, so he's not <br>piece-mealing anything.  I'm not qualified to determine how many kernel <br>functions he calls and how deep in the kernel THEY are, but its obvious this <br>patch wasn't extremely invasive, more additive, and that it's as self coherent <br>as it can be.  Therefore, the ones that maintain the file the function is added <br>to and any functions it calls should be easily determinable, as should their <br>status both within the kernel and in the patch.  The opinions of owners and <br>maintainers of at least the direct callees should be taken into account, IMO.  <br>If none of them object, there shouldn't be a problem.  If one or more of them <br>do, then it becomes more of a judgement call. <br> <br>As well, the request mentions that the IBM GPFS folks were instrumental in <br>testing the patch.  I also noted that the original patch proposal included a <br>straight EXPORT, not the GPL_EXPORT that is the current situation.  I <br>don't know the history of that, whether general kernel policy changed since <br>then, whether it was introduced with GPL_EXPORT by policy or <br>deliberately changed on introduction, or what, but it does seem obvious that <br>the original intention was that it be generally exported as evidenced by the <br>unrestricted EXPORT in the original patch proposal. <br> <br>As the article points out, the request is a generally valid request in that it's a <br>legitimate function that filesystems of the general genre could certainly use.  <br>Thus, the policy debate shouldn't be restricted to this particular case, either.  <br>As Morton seemed to be getting at, the question then becomes one of is this a <br>function that we want to export to make available to non-GPL callers or not?  <br>If the answer is yes, then certainly IBM being the friendly force they are <br>shouldn't change that.  If they answer is no, then just because IBM is friendly, <br>shouldn't change it either. <br> <br>Then we have the question of GPFS itself.  The article is forthcoming enough  <br>with the information that it's IBMs, and that it originated in AIX and remains <br>currently proprietary, and with the BSD license info on the &quot;glue&quot; module.  <br>However, there's still a vital piece of info missing.  Presumably IBM is only <br>asking for this having considered and rejected the possibility of making the <br>entire fs open source, as they have with a lot of other code.  Unfortunately, <br>no mention of why this may be is made.  Is this something that indeed DOES <br>have NON-IBM intellectual property belonging to others in it and therefore <br>CANNOT be open sourced without their go-ahead?  (Of course, SCO is <br>claiming this to be the case with all sorts of previous IBM donated code, <br>which it appears to think it can restrict in entirety even without owning a bit <br>of it, simply because it touched AIX, a UNIX licensee.  I'm asking about a <br>more reasonable claim of third party IP.)  If that isn't claimed to be the case, <br>then it's simply IBM saying it doesn't want to release this particular code just <br>yet, for whatever reason, probably competitive.  That's certainly within its <br>rights as it owns the code in question, but it's certainly within the rights of the <br>Linux folks to fail to be cooperative with their code as well, then, in this <br>instance, despite past cooperation.  What is the current distribution and usage <br>of the filesystem and how would that conceivably expand if it were GPLed?  <br>IOW, what are the practical implications for IBM choosing not to open <br>source the FS at this point, and is it likely to do so in the future?  How might <br>the decision of the kernel folks now impact such a future decision? <br> <br>Yes, I just got thru a couple paragraphs up saying GPFS in specific shouldn't <br>make a big difference to the case, since it's already acked that the function in <br>question is a legitimate call for such file systems, which means it's ultimately <br>a larger policy question.  However, until another such proprietary file system <br>asks, it's just the one, and the question could always be put off until later, <br>keeping it GPL_EXPORT for the present.  Thus, the questions above about <br>this /particular/ case certainly matter to the degree that timing is an issue, <br>even if they don't matter to the eventual policy debate.  Unfortunately, tho <br>the issue has been covered two weeks in a row by LWN, both articles <br>overlooked this seemingly quite apropos question. <br> <br>Personally, as I mentioned last week, I'm all for letting them hang.  The <br>authors of proprietary-ware by the very fact that it IS proprietary are <br>demonstrating an unwillingness to operate in what most open source <br>developers have chosen to believe in to the point of making a commitment to <br>at VERY MINIMUM invest a significant amount of personal time in.  That <br>goes double for kernel developers, who've obviously invested a VERY <br>significant amount of time to open source.  For a propriatery-ware developer <br>to ask such a favor while refusing to open his own work is in some ways akin <br>to a slap in the face!  I firmly believe that every bit of code turned open <br>source makes this world a better place, and thus, believe that every effort to <br>encourage that should be made, and the converse also, that little if any time <br>should be given to abiding the requests of those continuing to support <br>proprietary-ware.  None-the-less, I'm pragmatic enough to realize that <br>proprietary-ware will not only exist for some time, and that we must co-exist <br>with it, but that sometimes yielding a bit may produce the greater gain, <br>ultimately, for libre-ware, and thus, for what I believe to be a better world,  <br>Unfortunately, there are still a few pieces missing from the coverage here for <br>me to hold a fully informed opinion as to the merits of this particular case <br>and how the current decision may advance or inhibit the software libre cause. <br> <br>Duncan <br>

      Is there anything in the GPL hindering me in distributing a Linux kernel<br>with any GPL_EXPORT changed to EXPORT?<p>I don't think so - that would in fact be contrary to the GPL!<p>So what hinders me in making those patches, destribute the revised Linux kernel (under the GPL naturally) and then I destribute the modules I want to load? Nothing!<p>Legally there can be no difference between the original Linux kernel and the revised one - both are GPL with a lot of different copyright holders.<p>Ofcourse the change GPL_EXPORT to EXPORT might convince a doubting judge that you stepped our some barrier, but I fail to see it has any legal significance.<p>Thus the whole question of allowing some modules to be binary and others not, and only some symbols to be available from binary modules and some not is bogus. It MUST be either or. See my comments above.<p>

      <p>It's even easier than that.

<p>IBM could simply create a second glue layer, one which does nothing but re-export invalid_mmap_range in a way that the module loader would be willing to link to the GPFS module.  License that layer as GPL.

<p>Or provide an enhanced Insmod program that can take a module that in no way offers a GPL license and converts the symbol references properly so they link up to _GPLONLY symbols.

<p>I think the only legal effect EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL has is that it makes it really hard to use a subroutine without the author's permission by mistake (or claim that you did it by mistake).  But whether the author's permission has any legal bearing is an open question.

      To my knowledge there's no legal barrier to patching the Linux kernel so that a GPL_EXPORT becomes an EXPORT, nor is there a legal barrier to distributing the patch or the patched kernel.  The potential legal issue is with the modules that use these exported items.<p>In my view, the main purpose of the GPL_EXPORT is to make it blindingly obvious to module developers that if your proprietary module requires this item, your module will be subject to extra scrutiny that might lead to a lawsuit from a kernel developer who thinks your proprietary use of GPL code is a violation of his or her copyrights.<p>To phrase it another way, EXPORT puts the code into the official exported kernel ABI, and using the exported kernel ABI to develop your proprietary module is pretty clearly making a separate work that is not derivative of the Linux kernel.  On the other hand, GPL_EXPORT is for stuff that's really internal bits, but the developers have some reason to make it look like ABI to well-behaved GPLed modules.  <p>Distributing a proprietary module based on Linux kernel internals is dancing in a gray area of potentially distributing derivative works without a license.  It might just get an angry developer to sue you.  One of the first parts of such a lawsuit would be an injunction against distributing that module.  Since almost all proprietary, binary-only Linux kernel modules are distributed by commercial entities for business reasons, it would presumably hurt to no longer be able to ship the module.  <p>In this particular case, IBM is trying to sell Linux clusters using this filesystem, and it would benefit both IBM and the Linux developers to identify and resolve any legal issues with GPFS as early as possible.  Exporting a symbol that apparently should be part of the official exported ABI would be a big step towards resolving this.

      &gt; Is there anything in the GPL hindering me in distributing a  <br>&gt; Linux kernel with any GPL_EXPORT changed to EXPORT?  <br>  <br>Actually, I believe so.  You are violating the granted license of the original  <br>authors.  You are free to make your own modifications and license them  <br>under the GPL and any other license you choose, but that doesn't give you  <br>the right to change the license of code that is not yours, which modifying the  <br>export provisions of said code would in effect be doing.  <br>  <br>IOW, the modification itself can be legally distributed, but you still violate  <br>copyright law by making the calls if you do so yourself, or by being an  <br>accessory to the violation if you do NOT do so yourself.  <br>  <br>OTOH, it WOULD be legally possible to provide the mods as a patch or in  <br>other discriptive format, such that the on-site user could make the changes as  <br>desired and under your instructions.  Because the GPL doesn't restrict use, or  <br>modification by the end user (because the modified source only has to be  <br>distributed to users, which would mean the end user doing the mod, so it's  <br>already done &lt;g&gt; the reason companies can modify code for their internal  <br>use without distributing their mods), it's perfectly legal for someone to TELL  <br>you how to make the mods, which is effectively what a patch does, and for  <br>you to then USE the mods once made, including with their proprietary  <br>source.  However, the mods would have to be distributed in instruction/patch  <br>form, and be applied by the user.  <br>  <br>Thus, since the target market for this proprietary file system is presumably  <br>large business customers with which IBM would most likely be working to do  <br>the installation in the first place, it's easy enough for them to get around the  <br>GPL_EXPORT issue, in individual installations.  I believe they could even  <br>make the patch part of the installation script, as long as the distributed  <br>sources were kept pure/unmodified, and then modified at installation by the  <br>script or whatever.  It's really not a huge problem in practice, then, except  <br>that it would of course be easier not to have to worry about making the mod  <br>during installation, saving that step.  However, IBM is playing nice and asking  <br>for the mod, and it DOES prevent them from having to take that extra step at  <br>installation.  <br>  <br>Of course, IANAL and all that.. <br> <br>Duncan  <br>

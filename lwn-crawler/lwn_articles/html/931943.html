The "scatterlist" is a core-kernel data structure used to describe DMA I/O
operations from the point of view of both the CPU and the peripheral
device.  Over the years, the shortcomings of scatterlists have become more
apparent, but there has not been a viable replacement on the horizon.
During a memory-management session at the 2023 <a
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management
and BPF Summit</a>, Jason Gunthorpe described a possible alternative, known
alternatively as "phyr", "physr", or "rlist", that might improve on
scatterlists for at least some use cases.
<p>
The buffer for an I/O operation is usually described by an address and a
length.  In the virtual address space where the operation is requested,
that buffer is usually seen as being contiguous.  Things may look quite
different from a peripheral device's point of view; that seemingly
contiguous buffer may be scattered randomly in the physical address space.
The virtual address used to locate that buffer has no meaning to the device
â€” and the CPU's physical addresses might not either, especially if there is
an I/O memory-management unit (IOMMU) sitting in the middle.  Instead, the
device works with DMA addresses that may exist in their own space.

<p>
These differing points of view mean that I/O operations must be described
in two different ways; that is the role of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc1/source/include/linux/scatterlist.h#L11"><tt>struct
scatterlist</tt></a>.  It contains an (address, offset,
length) tuple as seen by the CPU, where the address is actually a pointer
to the <tt>page</tt> structure for the page holding the buffer; a
scatterlist is an array of these structures.  The
DMA-mapping layer can use that information to augment that array with
addresses and lengths visible to the target device.  If an IOMMU is used to
coalesce a scattered set of pages and make them look contiguous to the
device, the set of tuples seen by the device may be shorter than that
provided by the CPU.
<p>

Gunthorpe started his session by listing a number of problems experienced
by developers when using the kernel's DMA-mapping layer, many of which are
tied to the scatterlist representation.  It would be useful if functions
like <tt>pin_user_pages()</tt> could return folios, but the current API
works on individual pages, so I/O operations can end up splitting up huge
pages.  Since scatterlists work with <tt>page</tt> structures, they cannot
represent memory that lacks such structures, as is often the case with
memory installed on the devices themselves; this is a problem for <a
href="/Articles/767281/">P2PDMA</a> operations, among others.  The block
layer would be faster, he said, if I/O requests stored in BIO structures
did not need to be converted to scatterlists on their way through.  RDMA
users want to be able to pin large amounts of memory (he said 100GB) and
perform I/O on it "forever"; storing such allocations in a scatterlist is a
useless waste of memory.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox added another reason not to like them: simple cleanliness.
Gunthorpe agreed that everybody hated scatterlists; they are found
everywhere in the kernel, and "abused and misused everywhere".  The
structure is hopelessly tied to <tt>struct page</tt>.  There is no hope, he
said, of doing something better with it.
<p>
Gunthorpe's approach is to improve the DMA API to provide better
operations; an initial implementation can be found in <a
href="https://github.com/jgunthorpe/linux/commit/2339ecbcce0ca56361173a77e54dc71ab83027bc">his
GitHub repository</a>.  It involves creating a "range CPU" iterator that
would operate over intervals of (physical) CPU memory; it could be used to
create a DMA buffer that would serve as a handle for peer-to-peer memory
and which could be stuffed into an IOMMU.  There would be an equivalent
"range DMA" iterator to iterate over DMA addresses, and various options to
map between the two.  A new pinning API would take a range CPU iterator as
an argument.  There would be a number of storage options for the iterator,
including scatterlists, BIOs, <tt>page</tt> structures, and more.  Users
could then iterate over these ranges without worrying about how they are
represented.
<p>
He started into the project thinking that "this doesn't sound too bad", but
got a quick education, he said.  There are 23 separate sets of DMA
operations in the kernel, he said, many of which are for "weird old IOMMUs"
like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_address_remapping_table">GARTs</a>.
He really doesn't want to touch that code.  So, instead, he is working on a
performant version of a new set of DMA operations for current architectures
without trying to support the older ones.
<p>
Then, he said, there is the perennial issue of the
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> family of functions, which are used in many
performance-critical places in the kernel.  Getting these functions to
return data beyond the <tt>page</tt> structures they handle now will be
costly; he wondered if there would be any appetite for slowing down
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> for this improvement.  Dan Williams asked what
kind of added output was being discussed here; Gunthorpe said that the
functions would return a set of folios.
<p>
Wilcox said that there are two types of users of these functions, some of
which are performance critical and some of which are not.  The former users
can continue to use <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, while the others could call
something like <tt>get_user_range()</tt> instead and get the extra
information.  Gunthorpe said that would involve duplicating much of the
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> code, when there are already a couple of
implementations in the kernel.  John Hubbard suggested creating the new
version of the interface, then opportunistically factoring pieces out as it
makes sense.
<p>
The session began to wind down with a seeming consensus that this work is
on the right track.  Williams said that, if it turns out to be useful, it
would eventually be necessary to rewrite all of the existing scatterlist
users, but that idea received some pushback.  Gunthorpe said it would be
great if everybody used the new API, but getting there would be painful
work that is not likely to happen.  Wilcox agreed that existing scatterlist
users should mostly be left alone; they can be converted at leisure later.
Gunthorpe, though, repeated that a complete conversion was not likely to ever
happen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

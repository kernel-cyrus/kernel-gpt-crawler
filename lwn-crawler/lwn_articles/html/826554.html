<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 21, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/695355/">memory protection keys</a> feature was
added to the 4.6 kernel in 2016; it allows user space to group pages into
"protection domains" that can have their access restricted independently of
the normal page protections.  There is no equivalent feature for kernel
space; access to memory in the kernel's portion of the address space is
controlled exclusively by the page protections.  That situation may be about
to change, though, as a result of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200717072056.73134-1-ira.weiny@intel.com/">protection
keys supervisor (PKS) patch set</a> posted by Ira Weiny (with many patches
written by Fenghua Yu).
<p>

Virtual-memory systems maintain a set of protection bits in their page
tables; those bits specify the types of accesses (read, write, or execute)
that are allowed for a given processor mode.  These protections are
implemented by the hardware, and even the kernel cannot get around them
without changing them first.  On the face of it, the normal page
protections would appear to be sufficient for the task of keeping the
kernel away from pages that, for whatever reason, it should not be
accessing.  Those protections do indeed do the job in a number of places;
for example, page protections prevent the kernel from writing to its own
code.

<p>
Page protections work less well,
though, in situations where the kernel should be kept away from some memory
<i>most</i> of the time, but where occasional access must be allowed.
Changing page protections is a relatively expensive operation involving
tasks like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">translation
lookaside buffer</a> invalidations; doing so frequently
would hurt the performance of the kernel.  Given that protecting memory
from the kernel is usually done as a way of protecting against kernel bugs
that, one hopes, do not normally exist anyway, that performance hit is one
that few users are willing to pay.
<p>
If memory could be protected from the kernel in a way that efficiently
allows occasional access, though, there is likely to be more interest.
That is the purpose of the PKS feature, which will be supported in future Intel CPUs.
PKS associates a four-bit protection key with each page in the kernel's
address space, thus allowing each of those pages to be independently assigned to one of
sixteen zones.  Each of those zones can be set to disallow write access
from the kernel, or to disallow all access altogether.  Changing those
restrictions can be done much more quickly than changing the protections on
those pages.
<p>
The patch set adds a few new functions for management of protection keys,
starting with the allocation and deallocation routines:
<p>
<pre>
    int pks_key_alloc(const char * const pkey_user);
    void pks_key_free(int pkey);
</pre>
<p>
A protection key is allocated with <tt>pks_key_alloc()</tt>; the
<tt>pkey_user</tt> string only appears in an associated debugfs file.  The
return value will either be the key that has been allocated, or a negative
error code if the allocation fails.  A previously allocated key can be
freed with <tt>pks_key_free()</tt>.
<p>
Code using protection keys must be prepared for <tt>pks_key_alloc()</tt> to
fail.  This feature will not be available at all on most running systems
for some time, so there may be no keys to allocate.  Even when the hardware
is available, there are only fifteen keys available for the entire kernel
to use (since key zero is reserved as the default for all pages).  If there
is contention for keys, not every subsystem will succeed in allocating one.
The good news is that failure to allocate a key just leaves the affected
subsystem in the situation it's in today; everything still works, but the
additional protection will not be available.
<p>
Putting a specific page under the control of a given key is done by setting
its (regular) protections in the usual ways and using the <tt>PAGE_KERNEL_PKEY()</tt>
macro to set the appropriate bits in the protection field.  Once the key
has been set, there is no further need to modify the page's protections.
When a key is first allocated, it will be set to disallow all access to any
pages associated with that key.  Changing the restrictions is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    void pks_update_protection(int pkey, unsigned long protection);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>protection</tt> is zero (to enable all access allowed by the
ordinary page protections), <tt>PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE</tt>, or
<tt>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</tt>.  This operation is relatively fast; one
reason for that is that it only applies to the current thread.  One thread
running in the kernel can thus enable access to a specific zone without opening
it up to kernel code running in other threads.
<p>
One can think of a number of areas where this feature might be useful
within the kernel.  Protecting memory containing cryptographic keys from
all access will raise the bar for any attacker trying to get at those
keys.  The initial focus for this patch set, though, is protecting device
memory from stray writes.  The kernel accesses memory found on peripheral
devices by mapping that memory into its own address space; that makes
access quick, but it also opens up a whole new range of potential problems
should the kernel accidentally write to the wrong place.
<p>
Kernel developers famously experienced this eventuality back in 2008, when
writes to the wrong place <a href="/Articles/304105/">destroyed numerous
e1000e network interface cards</a> before being tracked down.  That problem
was at least highly evident; users tend to notice when they can no longer
connect to the net.  The advent of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory">persistent
memory</a>, though, has raised
the stakes on this kind of problem.  This memory holds important user data;
a stray write will corrupt that data in ways that may not be discovered for
some time.  Persistent memory can occupy terabytes of address space —
something that a network interface is unlikely to do — so the target for
misdirected writes is significantly larger.  It would be undesirable for
Linux to gain a reputation as the sort of system that occasionally trashes
data in persistent memory, so an additional level of protection seems like
a useful thing to have.
<p>
The PKS patch set provides this protection by allocating a single
protection key for all device memory.  Device drivers wishing to opt into
the protection provided by this key can do so by setting a new flag in the
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7.8/source/include/linux/memremap.h#L94"><tt>dev_pagemap</tt>
structure</a> associated with the memory in question.  This memory will be
set up with writes disabled (but reads allowed); whenever the kernel needs
to write to that memory, it will need to adjust the restrictions first.
That can be done with a couple of helper functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void dev_access_enable();
    void dev_access_disable()
</pre>
<p>
Most of the time, though, those calls are not necessary.  It is already a
bug to access device memory without having first called <tt>kmap()</tt> (or
one of its variants); the patch set enhances those functions to
enable write access whenever a mapping obtained from <tt>kmap()</tt> exists
for a protected region.  Naturally, that means that, if a driver marks
memory as being protected, calls <tt>kmap()</tt> on the memory, then keeps
the mapping around forever, the extra access protection for all device
memory using this mechanism will vanish.  Hopefully, all users are calling
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt>, which requires mappings to be short-lived and is
more efficient as well.
<p>
While there seems to be a consensus that this feature is worth supporting
in the kernel, there is still some ongoing discussion about various details
of how it is implemented.  It thus seems unlikely to be ready to be merged
when the 5.9 merge window opens next month.  PKS may well find its way into
the kernel in a subsequent development cycle, though, making the kernel
that much less likely to overwrite a persistent-memory device by mistake.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The marketing names tend not to line up all that well with the names we use in the kernel, which can make it hard to find.  Here&#x27;s one place I found that appears to actually sell them:<br>

<a href="https://www.cdw.com/product/Intel-Optane-DC-Persistent-DDR-T-128-GB-DIMM-288-pin-4-Pack/5749247">https://www.cdw.com/product/Intel-Optane-DC-Persistent-DD...</a><br>
<p>
Please note, though, these can only go into very specific systems with very specific firmware and in very specific configurations.  You can&#x27;t just buy one and throw it in a normal system.  Disclaimer: I work at Intel.  I have no connection to the vendor above, the link was just the first thing that popped up when I searched for the marketing name for the NVDIMMs.<br>

      <p>Lenovo will sell you a system with Optane DC (price on application, though) - the ThinkSystem SR570 and SR650 (at least) support it as a chargeable extra. Dell claim it's an option on the PowerEdge R640, but only if you contact your Dell rep. It looks like Gigabyte's MD71, MU71, and MD61 series motherboards also support Optane DC when fitted with a compatible processor.

Hmm, it seems subpar that you&#x27;d have to trust all drivers to not get it wrong and leave the write protect disabled.  Given what happens on driver land, that&#x27;s almost the same as not having the protection in the first place.<br>
<p>
Maybe It should grow a dev_protectmore() of some sort that moves the memory to another zone which is permanently protected (it is fine if it can be moved back to the normal dev zone with a dev_needsomewriting(), the point is that it won&#x27;t be left writeable because of issues in any other driver in the system ).  <br>
<p>
Might even be what is normally used for memory the kernel should not write to, since it would cost the full TLB Flushing, etc. So it would not necessarily need to use a second protection key.<br>
<p>
Or is it working like that already?<br>

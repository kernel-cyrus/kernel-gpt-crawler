           </div>
Mounting filesystems is a complicated business.  The kernel supports a wide
variety of filesystem types, and each has its own, 
often extensive set of options.  As a result, the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt>
system call</a> is complex, and the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html#FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT_MOUNT_OPTIONS">list of mount
options</a> is a rather long read.  But even with all of that complexity,
<tt>mount()</tt> does not do everything that users would like.  For
example, the options for a mount operation must all fit within a single
4096-byte page — the fact that this is a problem for some users is
illustrative in its own right.  The
problems with <tt>mount()</tt> have come up at various meetings, including
<a href="/Articles/753473/">at the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit</a>.  A <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/153126248868.14533.9751473662727327569.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">set
of patches</a> implementing a new approach is getting closer to being
ready, but it features some complexity of its own and there are some
remaining concerns about the proposed system-call API.
<p>

This patch set, from David Howells, is in its ninth revision.  It makes
extensive changes within the virtual filesystem layer to create the concept
of a "filesystem context" that describes a specific mount operation.  The
questions about the internal changes have mostly been resolved at this
point; things seem about ready to go in at that level.  But the patch set
also replaces the <tt>mount()</tt> system call with a rather more complex
set of operations.  (To be precise, <tt>mount()</tt> would not go away as
long as it is needed, but it is unlikely to gain new
functionality after the new system calls go in.)
<p>
<h4>The new way of mounting</h4>
<p>
In current kernels, a single <tt>mount()</tt> call does everything required
to mount a filesystem at a specific location in the system hierarchy.  With these
patches applied, instead, the process would begin with a call to the new 
<tt>fsopen()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int fsopen(const char *fsname, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>fsname</tt> parameter identifies the type of the filesystem to be
mounted — <tt>ext4</tt> or <tt>nfs</tt>, for example — while <tt>flags</tt>
is either zero or <tt>FSOPEN_CLOEXEC</tt>.  This call doesn't mount any
filesystems, it just creates the context in which the mount operation can
be described and carried out.  The return value is a file descriptor
representing that context.
<p>
The next step is to provide the details for the mount to be performed; this
is done by writing a series of strings to that file descriptor.
The first character of the string is either
"<tt>s</tt>" (to specify the source filesystem), "<tt>o</tt>" (to provide a
mount option), or "<tt>x</tt>" (to execute a command).  So a reasonable
series of writes could be:
<p>
<pre>
    s /dev/sda1
    o noatime
    x create
</pre>
<p>
Note that these strings are not terminated by newlines; each
<tt>write()</tt> call is supposed to convey exactly one of these strings.
In this case, the strings written say that the filesystem found on
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt> should be mounted with the <tt>noatime</tt> option.
The final line (with the <tt>create</tt> command) brings the filesystem
context into fully formed existence, but does not actually mount it
anywhere.  There is also a <tt>reconfigure</tt> command that can be used to
change the settings in an existing context.
<p>
Things can go wrong at any step, in which case the <tt>write()</tt> call
will return an error.  More detailed information about the problem can be
had by reading from the file descriptor.  This feature addresses one of the
other problems with <tt>mount()</tt>: the inability to communicate the
details of a problem to user space.

<p>
Assuming all goes well, the next step is to mount the filesystem with a
call to: 
<p>
<pre>
    int fsmount(int fd, unsigned int flags, unsigned int ms_flags);
</pre>
<p>
The filesystem-context file descriptor created by <tt>fsopen()</tt> is passed as
<tt>fd</tt> to <tt>fsmount()</tt>.  Once again, the only flag for
<tt>flags</tt> is <tt>FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC</tt>, while <tt>ms_flags</tt>
describe how the mount is to be performed.  They can be used to create an
unbindable or slave mount, for example (see <a
href="/Articles/689856/">this article</a> for details on mount types).
Some of those flags, though, duplicate options like <tt>noatime</tt> or
read-only.
<p>
<tt>fsmount()</tt> returns another file descriptor corresponding to the
newly mounted filesystem.  Do note, though, that while the filesystem is
"mounted", it has not been mounted at any specific location in the
filesystem tree, so it will not be visible to users.  Actually placing the
filesystem into a mount namespace requires yet another system call: 
<p>
<pre>
    int move_mount(int from_dfd, const char *from_path,
                   int to_dfd, const char *to_path, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
To put a mounted filesystem into a spot in the hierarchy,
<tt>move_mount()</tt> would be called with the file descriptor from
<tt>fsmount()</tt> passed as <tt>from_dfd</tt> (<tt>from_path</tt> would be
<tt>NULL</tt>).  The location where the filesystem should be placed is
described by <tt>to_dfd</tt> and <tt>to_path</tt> in the usual manner for
*<tt>at()</tt> system calls.
Among other things, the <tt>to_dfd</tt> file descriptor will identify the
mount namespace in 
which the mount appears — something that can be tricky to do currently.  The
<tt>flags</tt> argument is used to control behavior like following symbolic
links or whether to automount filesystems when determining the source and
destination locations.
<p>
As might be expected, <tt>move_mount()</tt> can
also be used to relocate a fully mounted filesystem within the tree.
<p>
<h4>Other operations</h4>
<p>
That is the basic sequence of operations to mount a filesystem in the new
order.  But, of course, the real world is more complex than that.  Users
want to query filesystems, remount them into different namespaces, remount
them with different options, and more.  Three more system calls have been
provided to make these actions possible; the first of those is
<tt>fsinfo()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int fsinfo(int dfd, const char *filename,
	       const struct fsinfo_params *params,
	       void *buffer, size_t buf_size);
</pre>
<p>
This call can be used to query just about any attribute of a mounted
filesystem.  It is somewhat complex; interested readers can see <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/153126269451.14533.13592791373864325188.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">the
patch changelog</a> for details, or <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/15519.1531263314@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">the man
page patch</a> for a <i>lot</i> of details.
<p>
If the goal is to create a new mount of an existing filesystem, a more
straightforward path is to use <tt>open_tree()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int open_tree(unsigned int dfd, const char *pathname, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Without special flags, this call is similar to calling <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html"><tt>open()</tt></a>
on a directory with the <tt>O_PATH</tt> flag set.  It returns a file
descriptor corresponding to that directory that can only be used for a
small set of operations — <tt>move_mount()</tt>, for example.  But with the
<tt>OPEN_TREE_CLONE</tt> flag, it will make a copy of the filesystem mount
that can then be mounted elsewhere; it can thus be used to create a bind
mount.  Add the <tt>AT_RECURSIVE</tt> flag, and a whole hierarchy can be
cloned and made ready for mounting in a different context.
<p>
Finally, there is <tt>fspick()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int fspick(unsigned int dirfd, const char *path, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This system call can be thought of as the equivalent of <tt>fsopen()</tt>
for an existing mount point.  It returns a file descriptor that can be
written to in the same way to change the mount parameters; the
"<tt>x&nbsp;reconfigure</tt>" string at the end creates the equivalent of a
remount operation.

<p>
<h4>Playing with fire</h4>
<p>
There is relatively little controversy around most of this work, perhaps
because few people have the stamina to plow through a 32-part patch set
deep in the virtual filesystem layer.  The concerns that have been raised
have to do with the configuration API for file descriptors returned by
<tt>fsopen()</tt> and <tt>fspick()</tt>.  Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/686E805C-81F3-43D0-A096-50C644C57EE3@amacapital.net/">was
clear</a> about his concerns, saying: "<q>I think you’re seriously
playing with fire with the API</q>".  His worry, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CA+55aFzknfBLjg4-pRSCUeBFY3DWq04zX3PPyc949M0OygHktw@mail.gmail.com/">echoed</a>
by Linus Torvalds, is that the API based on <tt>write()</tt> calls could be
dangerous.
<p>
In particular, Lutomirski worried that an attacker might succeed in getting a
setuid program to write to one of these file descriptors, giving that
attacker access to files or devices that would otherwise be protected.
This problem could be avoided by using the credentials of the process that
created the file descriptor for all subsequent operations — something that
is supposed to happen already — but that is not
seen as a practical possibility; as Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CA+55aFznwKKy0Vj4Wxe16=2EUmgas_Dcr9QQ1tOJOQOEAVfr+w@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>,
even code that tries to get that right often makes mistakes and ends up
using the credentials of the process calling <tt>write()</tt> instead.
<p>
Solving this problem requires changing the API so that a call to
<tt>write()</tt> does not have arbitrary side effects in the kernel.  One
possibility is to create yet another system call and use it to communicate
the mount parameters to the kernel; that would prevent problems resulting
from a redirected write.  The alternative, which seems likely to be the way
things will go in the end, is to add a different system call to replace the
"<tt>x</tt>" operation at the end of that series of writes.  It would look
something like:
<p>
<pre>
    int fscommit(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>fd</tt> is the file descriptor for the under-construction mount
point, and <tt>cmd</tt> is either <tt>FSCOMMIT_CREATE</tt> or
<tt>FSCOMMIT_RECONFIGURE</tt>.  The <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability would
be required to perform this operation.  The end result would be that, while
an attacker might be able to convince a setuid program to write to the file
descriptor, that attacker would not be able to actually make the changes
effective without having already gained a high level of privilege.

<p>
Regardless of the final conclusion, this patch set will need to go through
at least one more round before it can be merged.  Torvalds has also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CA+55aFzEjPUGZFk7PnM0T6YEn5uRrscgyCHyhc_cYz0m8ejdLA@mail.gmail.com/">complained</a>
that the motivation behind this work is not well described: "<q>I sure
want to see an explanation for *WHY* it adds 5000+ lines of core
code</q>" (a lot of interesting information can be found in <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/29128.1531356361@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">Howells's
response</a> to that request).  There is clearly some work to be done
still, so this work 
will probably not be ready for the next merge window.  In the
not-too-distant future, though, the <tt>mount()</tt> system call seems
likely to become obsolete.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Leaving aside the various issues with the API...<br>

I'm really hopeful that it'll be possible to take the file descriptor returned by fsmount and use it as a directory fd with openat and similar, without putting it anywhere in the filesystem hierarchy.<br>

As soon as we were networked with programs that could accept remote procedure calls (RPC), we were in the world of 'everything is a file' / 'every action is a server' that's core to Plan9 and HURD. The uptake of chmod/cgroups/netns/containerisation is just slow reinvention on the path to uptake of these ideas.<br>

KDE and GNOME both have their own (mutually incompatible) virtual filesystem systems: KIO and GVFS, respectively.<br>

That's how I read the code.  It should work very similarly to an FD pointing into a detached mount (see "umount -l").  Use fchdir() on it or whatever you like :).<br>
<p>
I note you can't do mount manipulation inside a detached tree.  A detached tree is considered to have no mount ns.  In principle, mount requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the user namespace which owns the mount namespace.  In practice it currently tests that the mount namespace is the same by calling check_mnt(); this is a strictly tighter check.<br>
<p>
I also notice you can't nest this technique, at least in the current patch set.  OPEN_TREE_CLONE calls check_mnt() on the source directory, so you can't apply it inside a detached tree.<br>

I wonder why they propose fspick() as a new syscall, for what is in essence linkat() with flags. Why not just add the flags to linkat?<br>

linkat's semantics wouldn't allow that to work properly.  Linkat is supposed to fail when given a path to an existing file.  Of course this could be dealt with by adding a flag, saying not to do that.  And then there's the fact that linkat is currently only dealing with files, not directories.  You can hardlink a directory with it, and you can't mount a filesystem onto a file.  It doesn't quite match up properly.<br>

Isn't the name fscommit misleading; people starting to use Linux may mix it up with some commit operation on the file system itself, but the actually want fsync.<br>
Also he prefix fs is very generic. Shouldn't it be fsm (for file system mount) to make the intention and the context of the syscalls more obvious?!<br>

      It doesn't really matter, once you start coding you'll quickly realize that you're looking at the wrong syscall. With regards to consistency and logical naming for system calls, that ship has sailed long ago.

I really don't like the use of structured strings in this context. What is it adding? A dedicated system call to set mount attributes seems much more robust.<br>

<h1>State of the unionfs</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 15, 2008</br>
           </div>
LWN last <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/217084/">looked at the unionfs
filesystem</a> almost exactly one year ago.  Things have been relatively
quiet on the unionfs front during much of that time, but unionfs has not
gone away.  Now the unionfs developers are back with an improved version
and a determined push to get the code into 2.6.25.  So another look seems
indicated.
<p>
The core idea behind unionfs is to allow multiple, independent filesystems
to be merged into a single, coherent whole.  As an example, consider a user
with a distribution install DVD full of packages, a small disk, and
painfully slow bandwidth.  It would be nice to keep the DVD-stored packages
around for future installation.  What is also nice, though, is to be able
to keep a directory full of updates from the distributor and use those,
when they exist, in favor of the read-only DVD version.  Using unionfs,
this user could mount the DVD read-only, then mount a writable filesystem
(for the updates) on top of the DVD.  Updated packages go into the writable
filesystem, but all of the available packages are visible, together, in the
unified view.  To avoid confusion, the user could delete obsoleted
packages, at which point they would no longer be visible in the unionfs
filesystem, even though they cannot actually be deleted from the underlying
DVD.  Thus unionfs allows the creation of an apparently writable filesystem
on a read-only base; many other applications are possible as well.
<p>

If a user rewrites a file which is stored on a read-only "branch" of a
union filesystem, the response is relatively straightforward: the
newly-written file is stored on a higher-priority, writable branch.  If no
such branch exists, the operation fails.  Dealing with the deletion of a
file from a read-only branch is trickier, though.  In this case, unionfs
will create a "whiteout" in the form of a special file (starting with
<tt>.wh.</tt>) on a writable branch.  Some reviewers have disliked this
approach since it will clutter the upper branch with those special files
over time.  But it is hard to come up with another way to handle deletion,
especially if (as is the case here) your goal is to keep core VFS changes
to an absolute minimum.
<p>

That hasn't kept the unionfs developers from trying, though.  Off to the
side, they have a version of unionfs which maintains a small,
special-purpose partition of its own (on writable storage).  Metadata
(whiteouts, in particular) is stored to this special unionfs partition and no
longer clutters the component filesystems.  There are other advantages to
the dedicated partition scheme, including the ability to include one
unionfs as a branch in a second union; see <a
href="http://www.filesystems.org/unionfs-odf.txt">the unionfs ODF
document</a> for more information on this approach, which the developers
hope to slowly migrate into the version they are currently proposing for
the mainline.

</blockquote>
<p>

Another persistent problem with unionfs has been coping with modifications
made directly to the component branches without going through the union.  The
January, 2007 version of the patch came packaged with some dire warnings:
direct modification of unionfs branches could lead to system crashes and
data loss.  Given that filesystems which have been bundled into a union
still exist independently, they will always present a tempting target for
modification, even when there is not a specific reason (wanting to put
files onto a specific component filesystem, for example).  So a unionfs
implementation which cannot handle such modifications sets a trap for every
user who uses it.
<p>

The developers claim to have solved this problem in <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/265037/">the current version</a> of the
patch.  Now, almost every entry into the unionfs code causes it to check the
modification times for the relevant file in all layers of the union.  If
the file turns out to have been changed, unionfs will forget about the file
and reload the information from scratch, causing the most current version
of the file (or directory) to be visible to the user.  This approach solves
the problem in a relatively efficient manner, with one exception: unionfs
cannot tell when a process modifies a file which it has mapped into its
address space with <tt>mmap()</tt>.  So, in that case, changes may not be
visible to processes accessing the affected file through the unionfs.
<p>

In both cases, the unionfs developers would really prefer to have better
support from the VFS.  Some operating systems have provided native support
for whiteouts, but Linux lacks that support.  There is also no way for a
filesystem at the bottom of a stack of filesystems to notify the higher
layers that something has been changed.  Fixing either of these would
require significant VFS modifications, though, and the changes might
propagate down into the individual filesystem implementations as well.  So
nobody is expecting them to happen anytime soon.
<p>

Another significant change in unionfs is the elimination of the
<tt>ioctl()</tt> interface for the management of branches.  All changes to
an existing unionfs are now done using the <tt>remount</tt> option of the
<tt>mount</tt> command.  This change eliminates the need for a separate
utility for unionfs configuration and makes it possible to do complicated
changes in an atomic manner.
<p>

The end result of all this is that the unionfs hackers think that the time
has come to put the code into the mainline.  There, it would become the
second supported stacking filesystem (the first being eCryptfs), and would
help toward the long-term goal of making the VFS layer work better with
stacking.  Some people speak as if the merging of unionfs into 2.6.25 is a
done deal, but that is not yet guaranteed.  Christoph Hellwig, whose
opinion on such things carries a heavy weight, <a
href="/Articles/265245/">is opposed</a> to the unionfs idea:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 I think we made it pretty clear that unionfs is not the way to go,
	 and that we'll get the union mount patches clear once the
	 per-mountpoint r/o and unprivileged mount patches series are in
	 and stable.
</div>
<p>
Unionfs hacker Erez Zadok <a href="/Articles/265248/">responds</a> that
unionfs is working - and used - now, while getting union support into the
VFS is a distant prospect.  So he recommends:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think a better approach would be to start with Unionfs (a
	standalone file system that doesn't touch the rest of the kernel).
	And as Linux gradually starts supporting more and more features
	that help unioning/stacking in general, to change Unionfs to use
	those features (e.g., native whiteout support).  Eventually there
	could be basic unioning support at the VFS level, and concurrently
	a file-system which offers the extra features (e.g., persistency).
</div>
<p>
When one looks at a recent posting of <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260989/">the union mount patch</a>, it's hard
to see them as a near-term solution.  As described by its author (Bharata
Rao), this work is in an early, exploratory state; there are a number of
problems for which solutions are not really in sight.  The union mount
approach, which does the hard work in the VFS layer, may well be the right
long-term approach, but it will not be in a state where it can be shipped
to users anytime soon.  
<p>

In the end, the problem is a hard one, and unionfs has a considerable lead
toward being a real solution.  That, alone, is not enough to guarantee that
unionfs will make it into the 2.6.25 kernel, but it does help that cause
considerably.  Anybody opposing the merger of unionfs will have to explain
why the union filesystem capability should not be available to Linux users

Can unionfs be used as a way to install packages on a per-user level?

That is, mount ~/root/bin as a writable layer over /bin, and ~/root/etc over /etc and so
forth, then run tools like dpkg or rpm to install packages on a per-user basis?

That would seem to be a really useful tool..it sucks that unix systems are meant to be
multi-user, yet users still need to ask an administrator to install packages.

You would still need `chroot ~/root` to get the program binary find its auxiliary files
(remember, paths are often hardcoded).

The problem of "letting a non-admin user installing software" versus "not 
allowing malware to take over the entire system" is still unsolved.

To worsen things, these days the main objectives of malware are "(2) 
recover this user bank passwords, CC numbers, and SS-equiv number" 
and "(1) send the greatest possible amount of spam" because that is what 
the market want from malware. IOW, once the user is fooled to execute 
_any_ malware (even non-rootkitting malware) the damage is done.

It occurs to me that this could be used to make fakeroot a lot less ugly internally. It
wouldn't need to mess around transforming paths anymore, just union-mount something writable
over / in a per-process cloned namespace, fake out permissions checks, and Bob's your uncle :)
no harm can be done should the code 'overwrite' /etc/shadow or 'delete' /usr, because trusted
code could inspect the writable union target post-'make install' and transfer only those parts
which look acceptable onto the underlying filesystem(s).

I thought that the point of fakeroot was that it let you do arbitrary (virtual) chown/chmod's
on files you had just created, not that it let you scribble randomly on the existing
filesystem.

I guess you could have, like, a FUSE filesystem that allowed anyone to do arbitrary
chown/chmod, but could only be mounted nodev nosuid.  That might be safe and effective.  Or
something with containers?

<p>
I wasn't aware that was the case.  Isn't that a weakness in the installer or the package being installed?  You should be able to install the files in any directory you like and use PATH and other environment variables to make them found (even in preference to another version in a system directory).
<p>
The direction the Unix world has been moving in for allowing users to install things is for each user to have his own Unix system with root password; but at least in the old days, installing something privately in a home directory without system privilege was something explicitly allowed for.  In fact, you could have multiple levels of administration: E.g. system, department, team, person -- all through the use of PATH etc.
<p>
It isn't acceptable for an unprivileged user to override /bin at the filesystem level, because setuid programs rely on certain file names referring to certain files.

 Not being a specialist, what is the real advantage of using unionfs compared to having a
small partition - lets call it /mnt/disk and a CDROM mounted as /mnt/cdrom - then doing a "cp
-lR /mnt/cdrom /mnt/disk"?
 That is, using links to all the files. A link will not use a lot of space in the filesystem,
and solve the complex problem of mapping file attributes of different filesystem (how to deal
with r/w/x access restriction if the underlying filesystem is FAT, how to map a device onto a
FAT or ISOFS filesystem, how to deal with soft/hard links, how to deal with a file from the
source filesystem too big for the target filesystem...).

"cp -l" makes hard links. You can't make hard links between different filesystems.

You could set up a tree of symlinks, but a tree of links (hard or soft) also 
doesn't have the same behaviour as a true unionfs or union mount. If you
open a symlink to a read-only file on a CD-ROM then you get a file handle
that points to a read-only file. If you stack a writable layer on top of
a read-only layer using a union then you can open a file on the CD-ROM
for modification and the modified version will end up on the writable
layer and be seen by subsequent readers in place of the original on the lower 
layer. It works with existing applications that just call open() and write() 
naively. Without something like a union filesystem to do this for you, the
application would have to know about the tree of links trick and explicitly
do the "remove the link, copy the file, modify the copy" work itself.

 It would not be simpler to do a patch to interpret differently the soft link, kind of: "if
sticky bit is set, the target file is read-only, and the soft link is itself writeable, when a
modified file is saved, the symlink is deleted and the content of the file is itself written
in the filesystem".
 That would imply the filesystem supports soft symlink and sticky bits, but would not be that
intrusive, and you can still have read-only files and manage a chmod on this "unionfs".

man chmod extract:
 chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system
 call  cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the
 permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for  each  sym-
 bolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of
 the pointed-to file.

      <p>It's worth noting that the half a million or so folks who have treated themselves to the cute little <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/">Asus Eee PC</a> mini-laptops have found unionfs factory installed as standard. It's used to give an in-built 'lose everything and revert to factory-installed software' option.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the eee PC support forums are full of HOW-TOs for removing unionfs ;-)</p>

Also note the existence of "aufs" which is an alternative Unionfs.
The project is hosted at <a href="http://aufs.sf.net">http://aufs.sf.net</a>.

One of the drawbacks of "unionfs" was that the module couldn't
co-exist with the "vserver" patch to the kernel. The "aufs" module
voids this clash.

Kapil.

The kernel's address-space layout randomization is intended to make life
harder for attackers by changing the placement of kernel text and data at
each boot.  With this randomization, an attacker cannot know ahead of time
where a vulnerable target will be found on any given system.  There are
techniques, though, that can be effective without knowing precisely where a
given object is stored.  As a way of hardening systems against such
attacks, the kernel will be gaining yet another form of randomization.
<p>
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">Heap spraying</a>"
attempts to fill the target system's heap with known data; it generally
works by allocating large amounts of memory and filling it with the data of
interest.  A successful attack can fill much of the heap with a known
pattern.  If the target system can then be convinced to dereference an
invalid pointer into the heap, chances are good that the access will land
on attacker-controlled data.
<p>
As an example, consider a use-after-free vulnerability.  Once an object has
been freed, it can be allocated by the attacker and overwritten.  Then it
is just a matter of waiting for the targeted code to use its (now invalid)
pointer, and the game is over; a vulnerability that simply let an attacker
allocate and write some memory has been escalated into something rather
more severe.  Needless to say, attackers find that kind
of capability attractive; heap spraying has been used in a number of
successful exploits.
<p>
The heap, in the kernel, is a bit of a nebulous concept; one could think of
it as comprising almost all of the physical memory in the system.  But much
of the memory management within the kernel is handled by the slab
allocator.  In theory, there are hundreds of independent slabs in the Linux
kernel; <tt>/proc/slabinfo</tt> shows nearly 300 on your editor's system.
This number reflects a large number of in-kernel users of slabs —
subsystems that each need to allocate objects of different sizes.
That separation should help to thwart heap-spraying attacks, since the
ability to spray one slab should leave the others unaffected.  An attacker
cannot spray a heap that they cannot allocate from.
<p>
In practice, though, there is not as much isolation between users as it
might seem.  Calls to <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, which are how much of the memory
in the kernel is allocated, all share a set of common slabs.  There are
tens of thousands of calls to <tt>kmalloc()</tt> (and variants like
<tt>kzalloc()</tt>) in the kernel, so memory obtained that way is a fairly
obvious target for spraying attacks.  The slab allocator will also often
merge slabs containing objects of similar sizes, again putting multiple
users into the same "heaps".  In summary, the Linux kernel, too, can be
vulnerable to heap-spraying attacks.
<p>
As Ruigi Gong notes in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230714064422.3305234-1-gongruiqi@huaweicloud.com/">this
patch</a>, separating those slab users to thwart spraying
attacks is not a practical alternative.  All of those <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
users are not going to change, and turning off slab merging entirely would
have a performance cost.  Instead, a lot of protection could, in theory, be
had if all of those <tt>kmalloc()</tt> users were somehow separated from
each other, at least to a degree.
<p>
The <tt>kmalloc()</tt> allocator uses a set of a dozen or so slabs for
objects of different sizes; on your editor's system, the smallest is for
eight-byte objects, while the largest is for 8KB objects, with the size
(usually) doubling from one slab to the next.  When <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is
called, the requested size is rounded up to the nearest slab size, and the
allocation is made from that slab.  So, for example, a 36-byte request will
result in the allocation of 64&nbsp;bytes of memory.  Just to make things
more complicated, there are actually four sets of slabs as described here:
one for "normal" allocations, one for memory to be used for DMA, one for
memory marked as reclaimable (allocated with <tt>__GFP_RECLAIMABLE</tt>),
and one for non-reclaimable memory charged to control groups.
<p>
Gong's patch set adds another dimension to this matrix by adding another 15
slabs for each size — but only for "normal" allocations.  Whenever a
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> call falls into the normal category (which is most of
the time), one of the 16&nbsp;slabs for the appropriate size will be chosen
at random, and the allocation will be made from that slab.  In this way, it
is hoped, any memory that can be sprayed by an attacker will be separated
from the memory used by the vulnerable code that is under attack.
<p>
To raise the chances that things turn out that way, some thought has gone
into the selection of the random slab for the allocations.  There are two
values that are used in this calculation: a random seed generated at boot
time and the address from which <tt>kmalloc()</tt> was called.  As a
result, any given <tt>kmalloc()</tt> call site will always allocate from
the same slab, but the specific slab will vary from one boot to the next.
So, for an attacker, it is not just a matter of performing more allocations
to spray all of the relevant slabs; instead, a call that hits the correct
slab for the current boot cycle must be found.  It is not an absolute
defense, but splitting the slabs in this way raises the bar for a
successful attack considerably. 
<p>
Benchmarks included with the patch show a small performance overhead and a
bit of increased memory use when this feature is enabled; the cost seems
low enough that it would not be noticed by most users.  In response to a
previous post, Kees Cook had <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202305161204.CB4A87C13@keescook/">remarked</a> that
it provided "<q>a nice balance</q>" between the various options that are
available for hardening against heap-spraying attacks.  The fifth revision,
posted on July&nbsp;14, was quickly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/d9f96152-e48e-7a1f-cd00-b7d508c5560f@suse.cz/">applied</a>
by slab maintainer Vlastimil Babka; this work is now in linux-next and
appears set to enter the mainline during the 6.6 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Am I to understand this could/would reduce the success rate of a given any exploit by "1 in 16 boots"? 

<p>That margin doesn't give me super warm fuzzies.

<p>For reference, KALSR seems to be at least a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/0b5547c51827e053cc754db47d3ec3e6c2c451d2/arch/x86/mm/kaslr.c#L13C4-L13C11">1 in 30'000</a>.

<p> I guess they could potentially multiply with each other/other mitigations?

I'd argue the 1/16 of kmalloc and the 1/30k of KASLR aren't exactly the right numbers to compare.<br>
<p>
Historically, it seems that there have been many ways for KASLR information to leak, and after a single leak, the attacker has bypassed KASLR.<br>
So my understanding is the rate limitation step for KASLR bypass is rarely rolling a dice against the 30k number, it's just finiding a leak.<br>
<p>
By contrast, there are somewhat less pathways to accidentally leak whether two arbitrary kmalloc allocations will end up in the same bin.<br>
And if the attacker finds a leak for a given pair of allocations, it still needs to be cleanly repeatable with more pair of objects (around 8 times) if they want to target a particular machine.<br>
<p>
If the attacker immediately takes their 1/16 die roll without confirming with an infoleak first, they may crash 15 computers for every root shell.<br>
So the 1/16 boot chance is also not very likely to be the limiting factor in the wild, unless someone with a chain of exploits wants to risk burning them on a diceroll by making too much noise.<br>
Even just 1/16 should be enough that blind dicerolls are unlikely to be worth it<br>
<p>
(I think by that logic, having a small stack of 'cheap' layers of 1/16 randomess in different places would be much more effective than KASLR at 1/30,000. If the attacker can bruteforce 16, they can probably bruteforce 30k, but having a leak in one place doesn't translate into a 2nd and a 3rd one elsewhere)<br>

So.. this sounds like it's proposing arbitrary resource partitioning to lower the probability of an attacker-controlled resource and a vulnerable resource sharing the same space. Surely this must be at the expense of efficiency?<br>
<p>
Otherwise we'd be seeing this approach for any shared resource across computing..?<br>

I like the idea of limited per-allocation-site cache isolation, however, I fear that in practice many bugs grant primitives that make it easy to bypass the isolation.<br>
The general idea would be to return the page containing the vulnerable object to the Page Allocator. The vulnerable object can then be reclaimed by reallocating the page for a slab in another cache or something entirely different. In my experience, it is not uncommon that the vulnerable object alone can be used to exercise the needed control over the allocator state, and exploits commonly do just that.<br>
<p>
If there's interest in pushing mitigations further, it might be worth looking into another thing grsecurity is already doing; That is, randomizing the offset of the first object on slab creation, i.e., yet another few bits of entropy added to the kmalloc implementation.<br>
<p>
Was this considered in the discussion or would there be interest in doing that?<br>

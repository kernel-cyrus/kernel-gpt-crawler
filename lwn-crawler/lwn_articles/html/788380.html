<p>Even with radiators and fans, a system's CPUs can overheat. When that
happens, the kernel's thermal governor will cap the maximum frequency of
that CPU to 
allow it to cool. The scheduler, however, is not aware that the CPU's
capacity has changed; it may schedule more work than optimal in the current
conditions, leading to a performance degradation. Recently, Thara
Gopinath did
some research and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1555443521-579-1-git-send-email-thara.gopinath@linaro.org/">posted a patch set</a> to address this problem. The
solution adds an interface to inform the scheduler about thermal events so
that it can assign tasks better and thus improve the overall system
performance.</p>

<p>The  thermal
framework in Linux includes a number of elements, including the thermal
governor. Its task is to manage the temperature of the system's thermal
zones, keeping it within an acceptable range while maintaining good
performance (an 
overview of the thermal framework can be found in <a
href="https://blog.linuxplumbersconf.org/2015/ocw//system/presentations/2613/original/thermal-framework-status-no-transitioning.pdf">this
slide 
set [PDF]</a>). There are a number of thermal governors that can be
found in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1/source/drivers/thermal"><tt>drivers/thermal/</tt>
subdirectory of the kernel tree</a>. If the CPU overheats, the governor may
cap the maximum frequency of that CPU, meaning that the processing
capacity of the CPU gets reduced too.</p>

<p>The CPU capacity in the scheduler is a value representing the
ability of a specific CPU to process tasks (interested readers can find
more information in  <a href="/Articles/639543/">this
article</a>). The capacities of the CPUs in a system may vary, especially on
architectures like big.LITTLE. The scheduler knows (at
least it assumes it knows) how much work can be done on each CPU; it uses
that information to balance the task load across the system. If the
information the scheduler has on what a given CPU can do is inaccurate
because of 
thermal events (or any other frequency capping), it is likely to put too
much work onto that CPU.</p>

<p>Gopinath introduces a term that is useful when talking about this kind of
event: "thermal pressure", which is the difference between
the maximum processing capacity of a CPU and the currently available
capacity, which may be reduced by overheating events. Gopinath explained in
the patch set cover letter that the raw thermal pressure is hard to observe
and that there is a delay between the capping of the frequency and the scheduler
taking it into account. Because of this, the proposal is to use a weighted
average over time, where the weight corresponds to the amount of time the
maximum frequency was capped.
</p>

<h4>Different algorithms and their benchmarks</h4>

<p>Gopinath tried multiple algorithms while working on this project (an
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1539102302-9057-1-git-send-email-thara.gopinath@linaro.org/">earlier
version</a> of the patch set was posted in October 2018) and presented a
comparison with benchmark results.</p>

<p>The first idea was to directly use the instantaneous value of the capped
frequency in the scheduler; this algorithm improved performance, but only
slightly.  The other two algorithms studied use a weighted average.
The first of those reused the <a href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load
tracking</a> (PELT) algorithm that is used to track the CPU load created by
processes (and control groups); this variant incorporates
averages of the realtime and deadline load and utilization.  The final
approach just uses a simple decay-based metric for thermal pressure, with a
variable decay period.  Both
weighted-average algorithms gave better results than the instantaneous
value, with throughput improvements on the order of 3-4%.  The non-PELT
version performed slightly better.

<p>Ingo Molnar <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190417055514.GA27400@gmail.com/">reviewed the
results</a> and responded positively to the framework, but would like to see
more benchmarks run. He suggested testing more decay periods. Gopinath <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5CB75FD9.3070207@linaro.org/">agreed</a>, saying that
tests on different system-on-chips (SoCs) would be a good idea, as the best
decay period 
could differ 
between the systems. In addition, a configurable decay period is something
that is planned.</p>

<p>In parallel, Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190424163424.GG4038@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">noted</a>
that he would prefer a PELT-based approach instead of mixing different
averaging algorithms. Molnar <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190425173333.GA4081@gmail.com/">dug into</a>
the PELT code for ways to obtain better results with the existing
algorithm. He found that the decay is set to a constant; on the other
hand Gopinath's work shows that the performance depends heavily on its
value.  It should be possible to get better results with PELT if the
code can be suitably modified. It <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKfTPtBQs9yBPQbzZykvEca-pjjuSmB2wTAHJbFxuW-ew-ew7A@mail.gmail.com/">looks
like</a> at least one solution has been found that doesn't require 
significant changes.</p>

<p>Ionela Voinescu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/632321a8-d7f0-49a6-9577-95fac4c87b1c@arm.com/">ran
some 
benchmarks</a> in different conditions and found that the thermal
pressure is indeed useful, but without a clear conclusion on which
averaging algorithm to use. Gopinath and Voinescu agreed that more
benchmarking will be needed.</p>

<h4>The thermal pressure API</h4>

<p>Gopinath's work introduces an API that allows the scheduler to be
notified about thermal events. It includes two new functions.  The first,
<tt>sched_update_thermal_pressure()</tt>, should be called by any module
that caps the maximum CPU frequency; its prototype is:</p>
<pre>
    void sched_update_thermal_pressure(struct cpumask *cpus,
                                       unsigned long cap_max_freq,
                                       unsigned long max_freq);
</pre>
<p>The mask of the CPUs to update the thermal pressure is passed in
<tt>cpus</tt>, the new (capped) maximum frequency in <tt>cap_max_freq</tt>,
and the available maximum frequency without any thermal events is in
<tt>max_freq</tt>.</p>

<p>The scheduler can also obtain the thermal pressure of a given CPU by
calling:</p>
<pre>
    unsigned long sched_get_thermal_pressure(int cpu);
</pre>

<p>Internally, the thermal pressure framework uses a per-CPU
<tt>thermal_pressure</tt> structure to keep track of the current and old
values of the thermal pressure  along with the time it was last updated.
Currently, the update happens from a periodic timer. However, during the
discussion, Quentin Perret <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190425105658.q45cmfogrt6wwtih@queper01-ThinkPad-T460s/">suggested</a>
that it  be updated at the same time as other statistics. Doing this
work during the load-balancing statistics update was proposed
first, but Perret later <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190508090547.4glnypolmiw3cun4@queper01-lin/">suggested</a>
 that the thermal-statistics update would be a better time;
that would allow shorter decay periods and more accuracy 
for low-latency tasks.</p>

<p>The developers <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190418094833.owlobrx6x5gclvhy@queper01-lin/">discussed</a>
whether user-space frequency capping should be included in the framework.
The user (or a user-space thermal daemon) might change the maximum
frequency for thermal reasons. On the other hand, that capping will last
for seconds or more — which is different than capping by the thermal
framework — and the reason for the change may be something other than
thermal concerns. Whether the thermal pressure framework will include 
frequency capping from user space remains an open question for now. 

<p><a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190417182932.GB5140@gmail.com/">Molnar
asked</a> whether there is a connection between the thermal pressure approach
and <a href="/Articles/749900/">energy-aware scheduling</a> (EAS).
Gopinath <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5CB7BFBC.9090007@linaro.org/">replied</a> that the
two approaches have different scope: thermal pressure is going to work
better in asymmetric configurations where capacities are different and it
is more likely to cause the scheduler to move tasks between CPUs. The two
approaches should also be independent because thermal pressure should work
even if EAS is not compiled in.</p>

<h4>Current status and next steps</h4>

<p>The kernel developers seem receptive to the proposed idea. It is
likely 
that this, or a similar, framework will be merged in the future. Before that
happens, there is still some work left: figuring out the details of the
algorithm to be included (and whether to reuse the PELT code), the details
of the decay period, and, of course, more benchmarking in different
systems.

There are many other mechanisms that can result in frequency capping beyond just thermal events. In laptops, for example, reducing processor frequency is a standard method to reduce overall power drawn by the cpu, and more generally, interfaces like the Intel RAPL mechanism can be used to enforce power limits that result in cpu frequency throttling. Some batch job control systems, e.g. slurm, include capabilities to set power limits using these features. <br>
<p>
Is there something specific about the Linux scheduler under conditions of thermal pressure that makes it necessary to adjust features of the kernel when cpu frequency is reduced? I don't think any of the above examples pay any attention to this if so.<br>
<p>
Here are a couple of more or less randomly chosen references to ways that power capping is used in HPC systems, for example.<br>

My (naive!) understanding is that these specific thermal pressure events are very short lived, and can also be per-core. The scheduler already would take into account general frequency reduction over a longer term reasonably well, it is the rapid thermal reaction of cutting frequency drastically that is being added here specifically.<br>

TDP limits act are in my experience clearly faster than temperature limits.  Heat takes some time to spread / dissipate whereas TDP limits are calculated and enforced (by firmware) based on HW counters of what HW is doing at given moment, it doesn’t need to wait for the effects of that activity.<br>

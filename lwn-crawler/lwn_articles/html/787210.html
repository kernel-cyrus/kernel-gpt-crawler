"People think that memory encryption sounds really cool; it will make my
system more secure so I want it".  At least, that is how Dave Hansen
characterized the situation at the beginning of a session on the topic
during the memory-management track at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
and Memory-Management Summit.  This session, also led by Kirill Shutemov,
covered a number of aspects of the memory-encryption problem on Intel
processors and beyond.  One clear outcome of the discussion was also raised
by Hansen at the beginning: users of memory encryption need to think hard
about where that extra security is actually coming from.
<p>
Memory encryption takes a lot of forms, Hansen said; he was prepared to
talk mostly about Intel's offerings, but he didn't want the discussion to be
limited to that.  The feature is driven by a desire for the protection of
data while it is at rest.  Data stored in ordinary RAM is normally thought
of as disappearing when the power goes away, but even that data can be

<a href="/Articles/787212/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/DaveHansen-sm.jpg" alt="[Dave Hansen]"
title="Dave Hansen" class="rthumb"></a>

recovered with a sufficiently sophisticated offline attack.  Persistent
memory, of course, makes such attacks easier.  Those devices can have
hardware locks, but they apply to the whole device, while users would like
to have more fine-grained protection.
<p>
In particular, there is a desire to create separate encryption domains
within a system — one key per container, essentially.  Users feel that it
makes them secure, he said.  This type of encryption might be able to
protect users from a compromised operating system, but that is not
something we can do now.
<p>
On the Intel side, effort is being put into the <a
href="/Articles/776688/">"multi-key total-memory encryption" feature</a>
(MKTME).  The older TME functionality only supports a single key for the
entire system; it provides protection for data at rest, but does not allow
for any sort of separation of domains within the system.  MKTME changes
that by allowing different processes to run with different keys.  There are
patches implementing MKTME support (for anonymous memory only, initially)
out for consideration.
<p>
Rik van Riel asked at this point whether the encryption is managed within
the CPU; in particular, is data stored in the CPU caches encrypted?  The
answer was "no"; encryption is implemented in the memory controller.  Thus,
Van Riel continued, it provides no protection against attacks exploiting
vulnerabilities like <a href="/Articles/762570/">L1TF</a>.  Hansen agreed,
noting that technologies like memory encryption should always be evaluated
against prior vulnerabilities to see what they would have protected
against.  Memory encryption does not help against speculative-execution
attacks.
<p>
Hansen raised another interesting problem that doesn't seem to have an easy
solution.  There are a number of attacks on encryption keys that are helped
by having large amounts of encrypted data available.  When a mechanism like
MKTME is in use, the memory controller essentially becomes a high-bandwidth
encryption engine; that could facilitate such attacks.  Such things need to
be taken into account when considering memory encryption to be sure that it
provides a real security benefit.
<p>
Somebody asked whether memory encryption works with DMA I/O; the answer is
that yes, it can be done.  But supporting DMA requires programming the
encryption key into the IOMMU.  The AMD memory-encryption implementation
does bounce-buffering instead for now.
<p>
Future work, Hansen said, includes implementing support for the protection
of file-backed memory and persistent memory.  It should eventually be
possible to set keys at a device level, or on individual files (or
directory trees, more likely).  This functionality may be built on the
fs-crypt feature supported by some filesystems now.
<p>
Van Riel asked how many keys can be supported by current systems; the
answer was that each memory controller can handle up to 64 different keys.  In
the current patches, all controllers must be configured with the same keys.
There is talk of breaking that link, so that different controllers could
have different keys, thus increasing the total number of key slots
available but, 
Hansen said, "that sounds like a nightmare" to implement.  Memory can
normally be allocated arbitrarily across controllers; if only some
controllers could handle a given process's encryption key, though, the
situation would be complicated immensely.  It might make sense
when data is tied to a specific controller — data on a specific
persistent-memory device, for example.
<p>
Shutemov talked briefly about the additional challenges posed by CPU
hotplugging.  A new CPU likely brings with it a new memory controller,
which must then be programmed with the same keys used by the existing
controllers.  To be able to do that, though, the kernel must keep a copy of

<a href="/Articles/787213/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/KirillShutemov-sm.jpg" alt="[Kirill Shutemov]"
title="Kirill Shutemov" class="lthumb"></a>

the keys in its own memory, where an attacker may try to steal it.  It is
not possible (or not intended to be possible, anyway) to extract the keys
from the memory controllers themselves, so if the kernel can delete its
copy of the keys after setting them, key-stealing attacks should be nearly
impossible.  Storing the key in the kernel, thus, can only reduce the
security of the system as a whole.
<p>
As a result, there is still discussion over whether the MKTME patches
should allow users to set their own keys for anonymous memory at all.
There does not appear to be any security benefit from doing so; indeed, the
opposite seems to be true.  Users would be more secure without that
feature.  One potential benefit to user-supplied keys for anonymous memory,
though, could be to 
provide a sort of secure-erase feature.  When a given user's processes shut
down, the associated encryption key can be overwritten in the memory
controllers and deleted from the kernel, after which that user's data will
be inaccessible.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox noted that encryption doesn't come for free; he wondered
about what the power cost of memory encryption might be.  Nobody had a good
answer to that question.  Hansen did note that there is a "single-digit"
percentage 
increase in memory latency when encryption is used; total memory bandwidth
is unaffected, but latency does increase.  Another cost comes when keys are
updated; that requires flushing all of the CPU caches, which is expensive.
Setting keys is a privileged operation in the current patches; key slots
are a limited resource, so ordinary users should not be allowed to consume
them at will.
<p>
As the session ran out of time, it began to wander a bit.  A final question
had to do with where the key used for TME (which must already be present at
boot) comes from — how do
users know that it is secure?  There was not a clear answer to that
question either, but Hansen did note that the key originates in the CPU.
If the CPU itself cannot be trusted, then the question of how the
encryption key is generated does not matter much.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's actually not taxing to the CPU core at all.  The CPU itself it not even aware that encryption is occurring since the memory controller does a great job of absorbing and hiding the encryption overhead.  Like I said in the talk, there is some additional latency involved, but it's really hard to notice outside of very sensitive microbenchmarks.<br>

Hi Hansendc,<br>
I am a hardware engineer and I am a bit curios how AES-XTS (take Intel&#x27;s proposal for example) is installed in the DRAM controller with only slight performance impact? Since AES is a block cipher (which works based on the unit of 128bit data), it will firstly request one additional read operation from DRAM when the write operation is not based on the unit of 128bit. This additional AES-XTS engine (for memory encryption) may not only increase the latency of DRAM access but also cost bandwidth for the additional read operations. Have you already took this case into consideration? Thanks for the reply in advance. <br>

      <p>The unit of transfer for an on-CPU DRAM controller is typically one LLC cacheline. For Intel and AMD, that's currently a 64 byte chunk, aligned to 64 byte boundaries, regardless of whether encryption is used or not.
<p>You pay a small latency cost on each transfer, because the crypto finishes after the DRAM transfer, but you're still working with 64 byte (512 bit) chunks at a time as you do the transfers to and from DRAM. Some microbenchmarks are very sensitive to the latency of DRAM transfers, and will be affected by this, but the point of the caches (combined with out-of-order execution) is that the vast majority of code that runs is not sensitive to DRAM latency, just to cache latency.

I am a bit confused about the term &quot;on-CPU DRAM controller&quot;. In embedded system, there is no such on-CPU DRAM controller, instead a central DRAM controller is installed. The main CPU, usually ARM CPU, and other IOMMU devices are sharing this central DRAM controller. I can understand the write operation from main CPU to DRAM is very likely 128bit data aligned so no extra read operation is required. However, other IOMMU devices who don&#x27;t have a cache mechanism like main CPU may write to DRAM without 128bit data aligned. To get rid of any possibilities of additional read operations in a embedded system, could we use stream cipher for full dram encryption with some additional protection scheme, like change keys frequently? Or do you have any suggestions to overcome the weakness of stream cipher and still meet the security requirement on memory encryption?<br>

      <p>In Intel and AMD systems, the DRAM controller is a complex beasty, with store queues, coalescing buffers, and other such tricks; if you really do have I/O devices that are transferring tiny amounts of data via DMA, then you pay the price of tiny accesses. However, a write to the DRAM does not go directly to DRAM - either it goes via the LLC, or the DRAM controller has buffers to allow it to store in-flight DMA until it has a full block to write, depending on the age of the system.
<p>So all devices effectively have a cache system when DMAing to DRAM - it's just provided by the Intel or AMD CPU SoC, not by the device.

It seems to me that storing the keys in encrypted memory for programming into hotplugged processors would still not make them vulnerable to (specifically) offline attacks.  There would need to be a mechanism for providing them safely to another processor.<br>

That's a good point about offline attacks.  Our main focus at the moment is worrying about run-of-the-mill software attacks that could extract a stored encryption key that the kernel kept around.<br>
<p>
You're right that it would be nice to have some kind of enhancement to the architecture that could "copy" a key from one CPU package to another without exposing it to software.  But, that's definitely not something that today's MKTME architecture supports.<br>

Being able to do a keyload from a SGX enclave would likely give you the function you need without adding to the instruction set.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Hansen agreed, noting that technologies like memory encryption should always be evaluated against prior vulnerabilities to see what they would have protected against.</font><br>
<p>
Memory encryption, especially if combined with HMAC, could protect against Rowhammer attacks. So far, only ECC memory provides (imperfect) protection against Rowhammer, leaving a large share of computers in use today vulnerable.<br>

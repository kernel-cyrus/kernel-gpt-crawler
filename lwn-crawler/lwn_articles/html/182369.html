<div class="ArticleText">
A number of issues have been discussed in recent times that, while too
short for a full article, are nonetheless worthy of mention.  Here's a few
of them.
<p>
<h3>Development process</h3>
<p>

The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181696/">2.6.17-rc2-mm1</a> release
included, along with the usual huge pile of patches, a complaint from
Andrew Morton:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It took six hours work to get this release building and linking in
	just a basic fashion on eight-odd architectures.  It's getting out
	of control....
	<p>
  	Could patch submitters _please_ be a lot more careful about getting
	the Kconfig correct, testing various Kconfig combinations (yes
	sometimes people will want to disable your lovely new feature) and
	just generally think about these things a bit harder?  It isn't
	rocket science.
</div>
<p>
Andrew, it seems, is getting too many submissions which lack basic
testing.  Occasionally things simply don't compile.  More often, patches
create problems when their particular configuration options are disabled,
or for architectures not tested by the original developer.  Andrew ends up
fixing those problems, and that takes a fair amount of his time.  The <a
href="/Articles/182370/">bigger issue</a> is elsewhere, however:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	My main reason for the big whine is that this defect rate indicates
	that people just aren't being sufficiently careful in their work.
	If so many silly trivial things are slipping through, then what
	does this tell us about the big things, ie: runtime bugs?
</div>
<p>
There has been some discussion of how the situation could be improved.
Ideas include better automated kernel build farms which would allow any
developer to get wider build testing and <a href="/Articles/182371/">a
checklist</a> to be gone over before patches are sent for review.  But what
is really needed is for developers to simply take a little more care in the
preparation of their patches.

<p>
<h3>CKRM rebranded</h3>
<p>

The CKRM resource management patches have been <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/145135/">received unenthusiatically</a>
by the development community in the past.  To many, CKRM looks like a large
body of complex code, with hooks distributed throughout the kernel,
providing functionality which is of interest to relatively few users.  So
the CKRM proposals have not gotten very far, and the development team has
been quiet recently.
<p>

What the developers have been doing, however, is reworking the CKRM patches
in an attempt to make them more palatable.  The result is now known as <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181857/">Resource Groups</a>, and it is, once
again, being pushed for inclusion into the kernel.  The Resource Group code
has been put on a diet, with many features removed and others shoved out to
user space.  Duplicated code has been taken out, and a major effort has
been made to use kernel library primitives wherever possible.
<p>

Andrew Morton had <a href="/Articles/182376/">a reasonable positive
reaction</a> to the new code submission, saying "<q>...the overall code
quality is probably the best I've seen for an initial submission of this
magnitude</q>".  He was <a href="/Articles/182378/">more worried</a>
about a proposed memory controller, however, which looks to duplicate much
of the memory management subsystem.  There have not been a whole lot of
comments from elsewhere in the community, however.

<p>
<h3>Not so unlikely after all</h3>
<p>

The kernel provides a couple of macros, called <tt>likely()</tt> and
<tt>unlikely()</tt>, which are intended to provide hints to the compiler
regarding which way a test in an <tt>if</tt> statement might go.  The
processor can then use that hint, at run time, to direct its branch
prediction and speculative execution optimizations.  These macros are used
fairly heavily throughout the kernel to reflect what the programmer
thinks will happen.
<p>
A well-known fact of life is that programmers can have a very hard time
guessing which parts of their code will actually consume the most processor
time.  It turns out that they aren't always very good at choosing the
likely branches in their code either.  To drive this point home, Daniel
Walker has put together <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181694/">a
patch</a> which does a run-time profile of <tt>likely()</tt> and
<tt>unlikely()</tt> declarations.  With the resulting output, it is
possible to see which of those declarations are, in reality, incorrect and
slowing down the kernel.
<p>
Using this output, Hua Zhong and others have been writing patches
to fix the worst offenders; some of them have already found their way into
the mainline.  In at least one case, the results have made it clear to the
developers that things are not working as they were expected to, and other
fixes are in the works.  
<p>
One <tt>unlikely()</tt> which remains unfixed, however, is in
<tt>kfree()</tt>.  Passing a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer to <tt>kfree()</tt> is
entirely legal, and there has been a long series of janitorial patches
removing tests which checked pointers for <tt>NULL</tt> before freeing
them.  <tt>kfree()</tt> itself is coded with a hint that a <tt>NULL</tt>
pointer is unlikely, but it turns out that, in real life, <a href="/Articles/182398/">over half of the
calls to <tt>kfree()</tt> pass <tt>NULL</tt> pointers</a>.  There is
resistance to changing the hint, however; the preference seems to be to fix
the (assumed) small number of high-bandwidth callers which are at the root
of the problem.  

<p>
<h3>vmsplice()</h3>
<p>

Last week, your editor astutely caught the last-minute merging of the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181169/"><tt>vmsplice()</tt> system call</a>
into 2.6.17-rc3.  Rather less astutely, however, your editor missed the
fact that the prototype for <tt>vmsplice()</tt> had changed since it was
posted on the linux-kernel mailing list.  The current prototype for
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> is:
<p>
<pre>
    long vmsplice(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, 
                  unsigned long nr_segs, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The use of the <tt>iovec</tt> structure allows <tt>vmsplice()</tt> to be
used for scatter/gather operations.
<p>
Since then, <tt>vmsplice()</tt> has picked up a new flag:
<tt>SPLICE_F_GIFT</tt>.  If that flag is set, the calling process is
offering the pages to the kernel as a "gift."  If conditions allow, the
kernel can simply remove the page from the process's address space and
dump it into, for example, the page cache.  With this flag, an application
can generate data in memory, then send it on to its destination without
copying in the kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I wonder why this SPLICE_F_GIFT option isn't the default.  Surely the physical page can be mapped out of the process and another provided in its place, either on-demand or immediately.  If the latter, and it's never written to, it remains clean and can be unmapped at need and used for something else if memory gets tight.<br>

      As usual, Andrew probably is right on the money. Maybe one problem is, 
that earlier Andrew, and long ago Linus, knew the kernel community 
personally, such that they'd know who's patches to trust and who's to be 
sceptical about or even reject. Maybe the sheer size and speed of the 
kernel community has outgrown that mode of development? 
<br /><br /> 
What comes to mind would be an automated reputation system for patches, 
that could give Andrew hints in what patches are likely to be mature. 
Think google pagerank for git! Something like this: If patches from a 
certain developer often end up rejected, be sceptical about that 
developer. If patches from some developer often end up being patched with 
small fixes, be sceptical about that. If a developer has contributed tons 
of code which has been in the linus-kernel for a long time with 
relatively few fixes, the developer is worthy of trust. There is probably 
also lots of data mining to be had from the different trees out there, 
from which Andrew and eventually Linus are feeding.

      this has basicly been implemented already.<br>
<p>
linus and andrew accept pretty much unconditionally from people who have consistantly provided good work in the past, others need to funnel their work through the trusted 'lieutenants' who are supposed to be doing the checking.<br>
<p>
however everyone gets lazy at times and this generates posts like andrew's every once in a while.<br>

      Andrew is sufficiently respected that he probably should just bounce back patches with a "Bzzzt... get it right, I'm not debugging this" for problematic patches.  Of course, the fact that he wasted time trying to compile it to begin with still slows him down.<br>

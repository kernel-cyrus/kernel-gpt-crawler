           <p>July 27, 2016</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p>Since the Linux kernel typically has multiple threads of control
running in parallel, quite possibly working on the same data, it
is essential to have primitives that allow coordination among those
threads.  Additionally, it is beneficial to have a wide range of interfaces
so that the 
right tool for any specific job is both easy to find and easy to use.  It
would not 
be fair to say that Linux has had a paucity of such primitives, but it
has recently gained a generous helping of new operations anyway; that provides a
convenient opportunity to have a look at what is available and why
something new was needed.</p>


<p>
<div class="tlrw">
<b>Composite primitives</b><br>
Probably
the most extreme example of a limited architecture is 32-bit SPARC processors,
which only provide <a
href="http://comp.mq.edu.au/%7Emike/comp226/sparc-manual/Load/ldstub.html">an
RMW operation that writes back all '1' bits after reading a value</a>.
This is sufficient for implementing a spinlock, but little else.  To take
a lock, the code can repeatedly use that instruction until it fetches a
number that isn't all ones.  This indicates that the current thread has
gained the lock.  It can then drop the lock by writing anything else to the
address.</p>

<p>For SPARC-32, Linux implements all other synchronization primitives by
first taking a spinlock, then performing the operation, then dropping
the lock.  It maintains a small hash table of locks, currently with
four entries, and uses the address of the value being operated on to
choose a lock to protect the operation.  This allows some concurrency
between non-conflicting synchronization operations and provides
reasonable results on what is, today, an ancient architecture.</p>
</div>



The class of synchronization primitives we are particularly interested
in here is the set of read-modify-write (RMW) operations where the value in some
memory location is read, modified in some way, and then written back, with
the guarantee that no other write will occur to that location between the
read and the write.  Referring to these as
&quot;primitive&quot; operations deserves a little explanation as
primitiveness is a relative term.  While some processors provide a variety
of RMW operations using single instructions, others are more limited and
require that each RMW operation be built out of component parts.  

<p>Naturally any RMW operation could be performed by taking a lock,
operating, then dropping the lock, but this is far from ideal, partly
due to the need to have those locks at all, and partly because each
operation then becomes at least three memory writes: lock, operate, and
unlock.  Fortunately, there is usually an alternative in the form of
another construct that is nearly as general as a spinlock while
not being quite so expensive: compare-exchange, or <tt>cmp_xchg()</tt>.</p>

<p>The compare-exchange operation takes an address and two values.  It
reads the contents of memory at the given address and, if the value found
matches the first value, then 
the second value is stored, all as part of the one atomic
read-modify-write operation.  Whether the write happens or not, the value that
was read is returned.  This operation can be used to perform
arbitrarily complex atomic updates while usually only requiring a single
memory write.  For example, an atomic increment, which reads the value,
increments it, and writes out the new value, could be implemented with
<tt>cmp_xchg()</tt> as:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    do {
        int old = *addr;
        int new = old + 1;
    } while (cmp_xchg(addr, old, new) != old);
</pre>
<p>Compare-exchange is generally quite efficient and it is not hard to
find a wide variety of compare-exchange loops like the above
throughout the kernel.  Building all atomic RMW operations out of
compare-exchange would be possible, but would often not be ideal.  For
more modern and complex processors, many such operations can be
performed with a single instruction, as mentioned already, and in those
cases the single instruction would be the better choice.  For older
processors like the SPARC-32, this sort of loop would need to take and
release a spinlock for each <tt>cmp_xchg()</tt> call, which is fairly
pointless when the whole operation could be directly protected by the
lock.
<p>
For these reasons, Linux has a suite of different RMW operations
that are implemented individually for each architecture.  These are
&quot;primitives&quot; from the perspective of a kernel developer writing
architecture-independent code like a filesystem or a device driver.
Some of them use <tt>cmp_xchg()</tt> loops, some use spinlocks, some use
dedicated instructions, but most of us don't care.</p>

<h4>Existing interfaces</h4>

<p>While there are exceptions, most read-modify-write operations in Linux
fall into one of two classes: those that operate on either the <tt>atomic_t</tt>
or <tt>atomic64_t</tt> data type, and those that operate on bitmaps,
either stored in an <tt>unsigned long</tt> or in an array of <tt>unsigned
long</tt>, possibly declared with <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/types.h?id=92d21ac74a9e3c09b0b01c764e530657e4c85c49#n8">the
<tt>DECLARE_BITMAP()</tt> macro</a>.</p>

<p><tt>atomic_t</tt> and <tt>atomic64_t</tt> are effectively 32-bit and
64-bit numbers, respectively, that can only be operated on using the various
<tt>atomic_*()</tt> interfaces, thus reducing the chances of careless
mistakes.  Apart from the trivial operations of setting an initial value
and reading the current value, the most commonly used operations on these
objects are to increment or decrement the value.  Next most popular, by a
fairly large margin, are <tt>atomic_dec_and_test()</tt> and
<tt>atomic_inc_return()</tt>.  These perform the same RMW operations, but
also report the result of the operation, in one case comparing the result
against zero first since that is the most common use case.</p>

<p>The most common RMW operations on a bitmap are <tt>set_bit()</tt> and
<tt>clear_bit()</tt>, which set or clear one bit within the bitmap; to do
so, they
must read one word of the bitmap, modify that word, and write it back out
again.  The most common bitmap operation that returns a value is
<tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt>, though <tt>test_and_clear_bit()</tt> is a
close second.  Again, these perform that same RMW operation as
<tt>set_bit()</tt> and <tt>clear_bit()</tt> while also returning a value,
but there is an important difference between the atomic and bitmap
functions in the choice of the value returned.</p>

<p>For the <tt>atomic_t</tt> operations, the returned value is based on the
value that was written to the memory address after the modification.  For
the bitmap operations, the returned value is based on the value that was
read out of the memory address before the modification happened.

For reversible operations like increment and decrement, this difference
doesn't really matter as the original value can be found by reversing the
operation, so &quot;<tt>atomic_inc_return(&amp;v)&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</tt>&quot; will
report the original value in <tt>v</tt>.  For bitmaps, instead, a
<tt>set_bit_return()</tt> would be pointless as it would always report that
the bit is now set.</p>

<p>Having inconsistent standards isn't ideal, but if all bitmap
operations reported on the original value and all <tt>atomic_t</tt>
operations reported on the result, it would be an easy enough convention to
work with.  However there is a growing desire to perform bitwise operations on
<tt>atomic_t</tt> variables, resulting in <a
href="/Articles/651629/">the addition</a> of <tt>atomic_and()</tt>,
<tt>atomic_or()</tt>, and <tt>atomic_xor()</tt> in 2015 because a number of
architectures were defining 
their own private versions.  These three functions don't return a value,
but what if one was wanted?  Defining an <tt>atomic_and_return()</tt> that
reported on the result wouldn't be particularly useful for much the same
reason that <tt>set_bit_return()</tt> isn't, and having it report on the
original value would be a confusing difference from
<tt>atomic_add_return()</tt>.</p>

<p>This came to a head recently when a patch (by Frederic Weisbecker) to
implement <tt>fetch_or()</tt> <a href="/Articles/695735/">was
submitted by Ingo Molnar</a>.  <tt>fetch_or(addr,&nbsp;mask)</tt> would
perform a bitwise &quot;or&quot; with the mask and the value fetched from
the address, and the result would be written back in a single RMW
operation.  The value this function returns is the value fetched.  This
patch was sufficiently imperfect that it triggered a <a
href="/Articles/695736/">response 
from Linus Torvalds</a> ("<q>This is garbage.</q>" — no-one
disagreed) and a subsequent discussion of various issues surrounding the
implementation, including the fact that it looked like it should be an
<tt>atomic_</tt> operation but didn't operate on an <tt>atomic_t</tt>.  I
do sometimes wonder if posting imperfect patches has merit because of the
increased discussion they can cause.</p>

<p>An important outcome of this discussion was a desire for a more general
set of atomic operations that returned the fetched number instead of the
stored number.  As Peter Zijlstra had <a href="/Articles/695737/">a
long airplane flight</a> shortly afterward, this desire soon became <a
href="/Articles/684775/">a
reality</a>.</p>

<h4>atomic_fetch_$OP()</h4>

<p>The new set of operations, which has been implemented for every
architecture supported by the kernel, each in the most appropriate style,
has names constructed 
with the pattern:
<p>
<pre>
    atomic{,64}_fetch_{add,sub,and,andnot,or,xor}()
</pre>
<p>
In each case there are two arguments, the first being a number
(<tt>int</tt> or <tt>long</tt>) and the second being a pointer to an atomic
value (<tt>atomic_t</tt> or <tt>atomic64_t</tt> respectively).  Thus, for
example:
<p>
<pre>
    atomic_fetch_add(v, addr);
</pre>
<p>
will fetch the <tt>atomic_t</tt> value at <tt>*addr</tt>, add <tt>v</tt> to
it, and store the result, 
returning the pre-addition value of <tt>*addr</tt>.

<p>This set of names intersects with the standard library functions that
C11 defined for operating on the newly introduced atomic data types, so for
example <a
href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic/atomic_fetch_add">the standard
library also has <tt>atomic_fetch_add()</tt></a>.  We <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/586838/">previously looked at</a> the
question of whether the C11 atomics might be useful in the Linux kernel and
the conclusion at that time was that they probably wouldn't get used.  This
choice of conflicting names seems to have shifted us over into the
&quot;definitely will not be used&quot; camp.</p>

<p>As a constant reminder that the Linux <tt>atomic_fetch_add()</tt> is not
the C11 <tt>atomic_fetch_add()</tt>, the order of arguments has been
reversed: C11 has the address of the atomic value first and the value used
to modify it second.  When Zijlstra was adding the new operations he <a
href="/Articles/695738/">acknowledged 
that the order seemed backward to him</a> but, as we have an established
pattern with <tt>atomic_add()</tt> and <tt>atomic_sub()</tt> having the
atomic pointer second, it would be inappropriate to use a different order
for the <tt>fetch_</tt> versions.  "<q>I forever write:
atomic_add(&amp;v,&nbsp;val); and then have the compiler yell at
me</q>" he reported, and it seems that it is just something we
will all have to get used to.</p>

<h4>The future of the <tt>*_return()</tt> interfaces</h4>

<p>When <a href="/Articles/695739/">Zijlstra
first hinted at his desire</a> for the new interfaces he
described a vision that went even further:</p>
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    I've even thought about reworking our entire atomic*_t bits to match.
    That is, introduce all the fetch_$op primitives, then convert all the
    $op_return ones over and finally remove all the $op_return ones.
</div>

<p>There has, as yet, been no movement from Zijlstra beyond the first step,
presumably because he felt that "<q>people (and this would very
much include me) would curse me for changing this</q>".  Others
haven't been quite so cautious.  Last month Davidlohr Bueso <a
href="/Articles/695740/">posted 
a patch series</a> that introduced <tt>atomic_fetch_inc()</tt> and
<tt>atomic_fetch_dec()</tt> based on <tt>atomic_fetch_add()</tt> and
<tt>atomic_fetch_sub()</tt>, and then proceeded to convert several call
sites that currently use &quot;<tt>atomic_inc_return(&amp;var)&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</tt>&quot; over to using
&quot;<tt>atomic_fetch_inc(&amp;var)</tt>&quot;.</p>

<p>As Zijlstra predicted, not everyone was happy about this change.  James
Bottomley, maintainer of some of the code that was being changed, <a
href="/Articles/695741/">wanted 
to see some justification</a>, and declared that if it was just to help the
compiler when it cannot optimize away a subtraction, then he's
"<q>not sure the added complexity justifies the cycle
savings</q>".</p>

<p>The &quot;added complexity&quot; here is not complexity in the code,
which is strictly simpler, but the complexity for those reading the code
who would now have a new interface to learn and get used to.  These atomic
operations <em>are</em> primitives in the sense that they are a core part
of the particular dialect of C that we use to write the kernel.  They are
not something we want to have to think about every time we see them.

<p>
Any language that is
in regular use must be considered a living thing that will grow and change
whether we want it to or not.  Introducing new words with clear practical
value makes a lot of sense.  Imposing the use of those words on others who
are quite comfortable with their current vocabulary doesn't make nearly as
much sense.  I have no doubt that we will see the use of these new
interfaces spread through the kernel in places were code is being renewed,
until eventually there may well be a strong case for deprecating the old functions
once they are hardly used any more.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One thing worth considering about RMW operations vs. a CAS (or compare-and-exchange) is that the former are easier to combine, and thus potentially more scalable.<br>
<p>
Consider two CPUs, each running two threads, and all 4 threads run an atomic fetch_add concurrently: While one may assume that the 4 operations have to contend with each other, it would also be possible for each CPU to just combine its two concurrent fetch_add's and send one combined fetch_add to the next level (e.g., main memory); when a global fetch_add returns, the CPU can decide which of the two CPU-local fetch_adds would be ordered first. This would result in contention between just two operations at the global level, and additionally contention between two CPU-local operations at the CPU level.  This can be less costly than contention by 4 operations on the global level because synchronization between things close to each other is less costly and because contention costs might not be linear.<br>
In contrast, a CPU can simply let just one CAS through, but it can't easily do much beyond that.  This is because the full semantics of the CAS-involving operation (e.g., the body of the typical CAS loop) might not be known or be too complex to capture (e.g., if involving branches).<br>

Could we *please* rename these so they don't conflict with C11?  Not supporting C11 is one thing.  Using nonstandard definitions of standard things is a different thing.<br>

atomic_fetch_then_or would work, perhaps?<br>

Agreed - the idea of adding functions with the same names as C11 and C++11, but with subtly different semantics (probably different memory-barrier behaviour), and with the arguments in a different order, and with the arguments in an order which even someone intimately familiar with the code is "forever writ[ing]" the wrong way, sounds quite perverse to me.<br>
<p>
Maybe it's okay for people who exclusively work in the kernel (as long as they're careful not to search the web for those function names) but it seems likely to cause confusion for anyone who works on both kernel and userspace, which includes any non-kernel developers who want to get into kernel development. Writing correct multithreaded code is hard enough already, it won't be helped by adding API ambiguity.<br>

Nice article, but it would have been good if there was some example of how these atomic RMW operations are used in the kernel? (I would assume some types of reference counting, perhaps setting/clearing per-CPU flags, ...?)<br>
<p>
Another importand detail is, how are these RMW operations ordered compared to normal memory accesses. Do these functions imply a full memory barrier? <br>
<p>
Just for the record, SPARC V8 does have another atomic operation called SWAP that swaps (without any compare). V9 added support for compare-and-swap (CASA).<br>

PA-RISC has only LDCW (load and clear word). That's equivalent to the SPARC32 instruction, but PA requires the word be 16-byte aligned. After much agonising trying to get GCC to properly align all spinlocks, we eventually came up with the solution that SPARC32 copied.<br>
<p>
Oh, and PA64 didn't introduce a richer atomic operation ... It merely added LDCD and kept the 16-byte alignment requirement.<br>

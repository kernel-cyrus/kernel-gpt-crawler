<a href="/Articles/908320/">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
The BPF subsystem has come a long way in recent years; what started as a
mechanism for implementing packet filters has become a way to load code
into the kernel for a wide variety of tasks.  At the 2022 Linux Kernel
Maintainers Summit, Jiri Kosina kicked off a session by asking how far the
transition to BPF should go.  The actual scope of the session turned out to
be rather more limited than that, and no fundamental changes were considered.
<p>
Kosina started by saying that BPF has been highly successful and it is
increasingly being used by user programs.  But the kernel community has no
policies about out-of-tree BPF code and, in particular, how to deal with
associated bug reports.  What happens when a kernel change breaks
somebody's BPF program?  Ted Ts'o added that future applications are
increasingly likely to include BPF scripts, and users may not be aware that
they are running something that is more like a kernel module than an
ordinary program.  That can lead to confusion and complaints to kernel
developers when things break.
<p>

Linus Torvalds did his best to cut this conversation short; it was, he
said, the same as the discussions about the tracepoint API that have been
had multiple times over the years.  People worry about problems caused by
internal kernel changes, but he has never seen such a problem in practice.  A
BPF program that depends on kernel symbols, he said, is not really a "user
program" anymore; "only Facebook people with system-management tools" are
running such things.  Steve Rostedt pointed out that systemd loads BPF
programs now; Torvalds answered that it is working, there have been no
complaints, and he did not want to waste time worrying about theoretical
problems.
<p>
I couldn't resist raising a related issue.  The kernel community looks
closely at symbols exported to loadable modules, but symbols exported to
BPF programs (as "<a href="/Articles/856005/">kfuncs</a>") are harder to
see and tend to go under the 
radar.  Christoph Hellwig suggested that a new macro for kfuncs should be
introduced so that these exports can at least be found with <tt>grep</tt>.
<p>
I also said that BPF changes tend to be invisible to the rest of the kernel
community since they go into the mainline as part of the networking pull
requests,
which can include thousands of non-BPF commits.  It might be better, I
suggested, if BPF stopped hiding inside the networking subsystem.  BPF goes
far beyond networking these days, and it would make sense for BPF changes
to go directly to Torvalds via their own pull requests.  Networking
maintainer Jakub Kicinski responded that working that way would be painful
since there is still a lot of work that crosses the BPF and networking
trees; BPF maintainer Alexei Starovoitov agreed.  It seems likely that
nothing will change in how those trees are managed.
<p>
At that point, any appetite for BPF discussions appeared to have run its
course and this session came to a close.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

We already have such a macro, just grep for BTF_ID_FLAGS.<br>

<p>
For better or worse, given that BPF has made it easier to add features that aren&#x27;t relevant to the core of BPF (e.g. kfuncs), it seems plausible that the trend will be for _more_ BPF-adjacent changes to go into non-BPF trees. On the other hand, HID-BPF [0] is going into bpf-next, so who knows.<br>

The actual HID-BPF implementation will likely go through hid.git; only the bpf-core prerequisities are going through BPF tree.<br>

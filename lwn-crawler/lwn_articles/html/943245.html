Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgfL1rwyvELk2VwJTtiLNpwxTFeFtStLeAQ-2rTRd34eQ@mail.gmail.com/">released
6.6-rc1</a> and closed the 6.6 merge window on September&nbsp;10.  At that
point, 12,230 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline
repository, which is exactly 500 more than were pulled for 6.5 at this stage
in the cycle.  Over 7,000 of those changes were pulled after <a
href="/Articles/942954/">our first-half summary</a> was written; they
brought a fair amount of new functionality with them.  Read on for an
overview of those changes.
<p>
Significant changes pulled in the second half of this merge window include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> After <a href="/Articles/926649/">years of work and discussions</a>,
     the Intel shadow-stack patches have finally been merged.  This
     hardware feature hardens user-space code against stack-overwrite
     attacks.
<li> The PowerPC architecture now supports "hotplug SMT", where some or
     all of the simultaneous multithreading CPUs in a given core can be
     enabled or disabled at run time.
<li> Changes merged for RISC-V include support for user-space access to
     performance counters, the ability to locate crash kernels above
     the 4GB boundary, support for <a
     href="/Articles/898040/">LLVM-implemented forward-edge control-flow
     integrity</a>, and support for kernel address-space layout
     randomization.
<li> The s390 architecture has removed the <tt>noexec</tt> command-line
     parameter, on the reasoning that there is no point in being able to
     disable non-executable mappings.  This change mirrors <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/76ea0025a214">a similar removal</a>
     for x86 in 5.19.
<li> The LoongArch architecture has gained support for a number of
     kernel-development tools, including KDB, KGDB, kcov, KFENCE, and
     KASAN. 
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new "eventfs" subsystem significantly improves the memory
     efficiency of the tracing subsystem.  There are thousands of
     tracepoints in the kernel, each of which requires inodes and dentries
     for its representation in the filesystem.  Those structures exist even
     if tracing is not used, wasting memory.  Eventfs will allocated the
     needed structures only when they are needed, eliminating that waste.
<li> The <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/smaps</tt> file now includes information on
     how well kernel samepage merging (KSM) is working to reduce memory
     usage.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The overlayfs filesystem has gained the ability to use fs-verity
     data to ensure the integrity of data supplied by lower-level
     filesystems; this is part of <a href="/Articles/933616/">a larger
     effort</a> to get overlayfs to provide the features needed by the <a
     href="/Articles/922851/">composefs</a> filesystem.
<li> The reiserfs filesystem has been <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2363650b22ed">marked as being
     obsolete</a>, a step toward its eventual removal.
<li> The process of merging the online repair functionality for XFS has
     begun, though it may be a while yet before this code is all upstream
     and ready for use.
<li> The NFS server now supports NFSv4 write delegations.  This mechanism
     allows for more caching of data and metadata for a file being written to,
     reducing network traffic and increasing performance.
<li> The Ceph filesystem has gained <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fscrypt.html">fscrypt</a>
     support.
<li> The ksmbd server (providing in-kernel SMB3 filesystem support) is
     no longer considered "experimental".
</ul>

     guests on Hyper-V.  </ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Unbound workqueues have gained a number of options aimed at improving
     performance on larger systems; see the latter part of <a
     href="/Articles/937416/">this article</a> and <a
     href="https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/core-api/workqueue.html#affinity-scopes-and-performance">the

<li> There was an increase of 326 exported symbols during this merge
     window; see <a href="/Articles/944037/">this page</a> for the full
     list of changes.  One kfunc (<tt>bpf_map_sum_elem_count()</tt>) was
     added as well.
<li> The support files for the GitLab continuous-integration tests used
     by the graphics subsystem have been merged.  See <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/automated_testing.html"><tt>Documentation/gpu/automated_testing.rst</tt></a>
     for more information on how this testing works.
</ul>
<p>
One significant change that was <i>not</i> merged was, once again, the
bcachefs filesystem.  Curious readers can see <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230903032555.np6lu5mouv5tw4ff@moria.home.lan/">the
associated discussion</a>; in short, Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjUX287gJCKDXUY02Wpot1n0VkjQk-PmDOmrsrEfwPfPg@mail.gmail.com/">was
not happy</a> that the code had never appeared in linux-next (a situation
that is <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230910043118.6xf6jgeffj5es572@moria.home.lan/">being
rectified</a>) and had some problems that wider testing should have found.
Even Torvalds, though, said that "<q>any further changes are better done
in-tree</q>"; it should be possible to get this code into 6.7.
<p>
Meanwhile, the time has come to fix as many bugs as possible and to get
this code into shape for the 6.6 release.  Assuming the usual schedule
holds (and it always does anymore), that release can be expected on
October&nbsp;29 or November&nbsp;5.  While it is possible that the next
release, 6.7, could happen on December&nbsp;31, that seems unlikely,
meaning that 6.6 is almost certainly the final kernel release for 2023.
Should that prove to be the case, it will probably be the long-term-support
release for this year as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

ksmbd went from experimental to stable an order of magnitude sooner than some NFS4 features…<br>
<p>
I've played around with it and it works, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get it to transmit regular Unix permissions though; a bit of a deal breaker if I want to replace NFS. Which I do, given all the headaches that's given me.<br>

It's interesting that online XFS repair is starting to get merged without having online XFS fsck (aka scrub) being marked as stable first. For large filesystems, it's very nice to be able to do regular checking instead of the dreaded 180-day monster fscks on a reboot (or, of course, going un-fscked, which has its own risks).<br>

Unless you special-cased something, XFS doesn't fsck AFAIK: fsck.xfs does nothing. <br>
<p>
Did you (or your distro) add something on boot that calls xfs_repair (instead of fsck.xfs) when it has been longer than 180 days since the last time it was verified?<br>
<p>
Also, for XFS, wouldn't online repair end up being the same as online fsck?<br>

No? There's a huge difference between checking for errors and trying to fix them online.<br>

I was going to ask for more about Dragon, but now I see the name. :)<br>

Well, congratulations.  I'll have to look in to it for my work - GDB/Crash is a great tool but aggressively clunky and scripting in it is (frankly) some bizarre half broken joke.  The work required to get Python support working is wild.  It's hard enough to use that I work fairly hard to look for options other than working with a crash dump.<br>

PowerPC has supported enabling/disabling SMT threads at runtime more or less forever, by hot(un)plugging the SMT threads using the sysfs CPU hotplug API.<br>
<p>
What's new is it can now be controlled through the /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control API, which is simpler to use, and is also common with x86.<br>

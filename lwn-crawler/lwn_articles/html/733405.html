<h1>A different approach to kernel configuration</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 12, 2017</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2017-Open_Source_Summit_North_America">Open Source Summit</a>
</div>
The kernel's configuration system can be challenging to deal with; Linus
Torvalds recently <a href="/Articles/733418/">called it</a> "<q>one of
the worst parts of the whole project</q>".  Thus, anything that might
help users with the process of configuring a kernel build would be
welcome.  A talk by Junghwan Kang at the 2017 Open-Source Summit
demonstrated an interesting approach, even if it's not quite ready for
prime time yet.
<p>
Kang is working on a Debian-based, cloud-oriented distribution; he
wanted to tweak the kernel configuration to minimize the size of the kernel
and, especially, to reduce its attack surface by removing features that
were not needed.  The problem is that the kernel is huge, and there are a
lot of features that are controlled by configuration options.  There are
over 300 feature groups and over 20,000 configuration options in current
kernels.  Many of these options have complicated dependencies between them,
adding to the challenge of configuring them properly.
<p>
Kang naturally turned to the work that others have already done in an
attempt to simplify his kernel-configuration task.  One interesting project
is <a
href="https://vamos.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/trac/undertaker/wiki/UndertakerTailor">undertaker-tailor</a>
(also known as "the valiant little tailor"),
a project that came out of the <a
href="https://www4.cs.fau.de/Research/VAMOS/">VAMOS project</a>.  This tool
uses the ftrace 
tracing mechanism to watch a kernel while the system runs a representative
workload.  From the resulting traces, it concludes which parts of the
kernel are actually used, finds the configuration options controlling those

<a href="/Articles/733422/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/ossna-lpc/JunghwanKang-sm.jpg" alt="[Junghwan Kang]"
title="Junghwan Kang" class="lthumb"></a>


parts, then generates a
configuration that only includes the needed subsystems.  This system, Kang
said, is novel, but "incomplete".
<p>
In particular, undertaker-tailor has a number of bugs; "it doesn't work and
needs an overhaul".  Kang tracked down and fixed some of the bugs, sending
his fixes upstream in the process.  The tool was badly confused by
address-space layout randomization, for example.  He fixed a few issues
until he could get a configuration out of it.  Unfortunately, the resulting
kernel failed to boot.  It turns out that this tool requires the user to
spend some time setting whitelists and blacklists, but that brings the user
back to the original configuration issue.

</blockquote>
<p>
Another tool for trimming down a kernel configuration is the <tt>make
localmodconfig</tt> command.  It simply looks at the modules loaded into
the running kernel and assumes that each is there because something needed
it.  It generates a kernel configuration that builds in those modules and
leaves out the rest.  This approach did create a working kernel, but that
kernel was still "fat", with numerous features configured in that were not
really needed.
<p>
So Kang went off to create a solution of his own.  He wanted to come up
with an automated system that would create a minimally sized but working
kernel for his specific workload.  His solution uses undertaker-tailor to
collect system traces with the use cases of interest running.  But then a
separate "tailoring manager" runs to create the configuration from the
trace data.  As was the case before, this configuration is unlikely to boot
and run properly.  So another process works to "fill in" configuration
options until the kernel eventually works.
<p>
This filling-in stage uses the <tt>localmodconfig</tt> configuration as a
starting point; it thus won't fill in options that are already known not to
be necessary.  The first stage looks at warnings from the configuration
system itself, adding options until the warnings are addressed.  Then
kernels are built and tested using <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/xnee/">Xnee</a> to simulate a desktop
session.  There is also a hand-built blacklist used to explicitly exclude
some options.
<p>
This process, which involves building and testing a lot of kernels in
virtual machines, takes about five hours to run.  It generates a kernel
that is quite a bit smaller than what <tt>make localmodconfig</tt>
provides, with almost all modules configured out.  As a bonus, this kernel
boots in 1/5 of the time.
<p>
Future steps include creating a larger set of workloads to be sure that all
use cases for this distribution have been addressed.  At some point, Kang
also plans to add support for kernels running on bare metal; currently,
only virtualized kernels can be configured in this way.  Even now, though,
he said that the resulting tool is useful for non-expert kernel users who
are trying to build a kernel using something smaller than a kitchen-sink
distribution configuration.  Those users will have to wait, though, since
Kang has not yet released this project to the world; he said he would like
to do that once he receives management approval.
<p>
<h4>Postscript</h4>
<p>
Presentations of this type are often as useful for the problem they pose as
for the solutions they present.  In this case, it's not entirely clear that
"non-expert users" will find it easier to create representative workloads
that cover all needed tasks, run them with a kernel under tracing, create a
suitable blacklist, and generate their final configuration.  The task still
seems daunting.
<p>
The problem is not Kang's solution, though; the problem is that he was
driven to create such a solution just to get through the task of
configuring a kernel to his needs.  The kernel's configuration system is,
indeed, one of the worst parts of the project.  But it is also a part that
nobody is really working on; it receives a bit of maintenance, but there
does not appear to be any significant effort out there to address its
shortcomings.  Two-hundred companies support work on each kernel
development cycle, but none of them see the configuration system as one of
the problems that they need to solve.  Until that changes, we are likely to
continue to see users struggling with it.

Honestly the largest obstacle to kernel configuration is the menuconfig tool hasn't kept up.<br>
<p>
Some newer systems are arbitrary such as picking a compression or encryption algo at random as 'required' despite the actual code not requiring any single algo, just AT LEAST ONE algo existing from a large set.<br>
<p>
Others are setup one-way (the USB &lt;-&gt; networking &lt;-&gt; wireless trifecta for example) for the requirements so if you don't disable things in the correct order you can't disable other things.<br>
<p>
And there are numerous "top level items" that could be pushed down a level (or two!) to organize the tree structure in a more 'discoverable' way.<br>
<p>
A lot of it is improved Kconfig's being needed IMHO; the existing actual tools are well thought out, but Kconfig's aren't reviewed anywhere near as much as the functional code I feel, so a LOT of really bad cruft and cargo-cult scripting has ended up in those over the years since the syntax seems entirely unique and unrelated to anything else.<br>

Yeah, the config system is a nightmare, especially when new options are introduced--the choices of what to default to N or Y by default seems arbitrary at best. defconfig should probably default to a modern machine.<br>

They already have kvmconfig and xenconfig.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the defconf should enable the components that one could reasonably expect to find on an x86 desktop or server system, and disable the more exotic drivers that one would never find on such a system to reduce the number of unnecessary components in a build.<br>

Actually, I don't even care what the defconfig is. But a "generic x86 desktop" config would be nice. My current method to get a base config for my desktop is to download a Debian or Ubuntu kernel .deb and extract the config.<br>
<p>
You can get said debs at <a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/kernel/linux-image-amd64">https://packages.debian.org/unstable/kernel/linux-image-a...</a> or <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D">http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D</a> . Make an empty directory to extract it to, and run dpkg -x &lt;deb file&gt; &lt;destination dir&gt;. Look in boot/ under the destination for the config. Copy it to your kernel tree as .config. If it's an older config, run "yes '' | make oldconfig" before using it.<br>

I'm really looking forward to using a tool like this.  I have been hand-tuning kernels for years but there's always something in the back of your head that makes you wonder if you really needed option A or if you left out option B which you could have really benefited from.  It's true that the config subsystem has grown so large that it's gotten out of control.  It's going to require an overhaul and a fresh set of eyes to really make it into something impressive.  But like the article states there is little demand upstream, or downstream for that matter.<br>

      I had the exact same thought when I first read the article. I was surprised there wasn't a reference to Aunt Tilly in it!

I am looking forward to such a thing to come up. I have been hand-tuning kernel for many years now and it is a cumbersome process, but you gain a lot of insight about it. But having a tool like this would have certainly help lesser mortals better time. <br>

Perhaps if the tool scanned the hardware first, and then generated a "suggested config" that could then be tweaked - bonus points if it includes comments on what it found and why it suggested that configuration - and even a "Found nVidia graphics chipset - would you like to use the free nouveau driver, or will you be installing the nVidia proprietary driver later?"<br>

Graphics drivers are particularly annoying here. You either want everything for a distro kernel, or want a very specific one for a custom kernel. But unlike (say) sound cards, the latter's not an option — you need to compile in support for all nVidia cards or all Radeons or all Intel chips. My /boot/vmlinuz is growing almost a megabyte per year because of it.<br>

This is indeed an interesting approach but it's limited to a single use case - rebuilding a config for a kernel that suits you. <br>
<p>
I would love to see someone try to tackle the need for a simpler configuration tool. Creating a booting kernel for an esoteric custom board is a hard task even for expert themselves, and its has to do with how the kernel config is organized (not how menuconfig works). <br>

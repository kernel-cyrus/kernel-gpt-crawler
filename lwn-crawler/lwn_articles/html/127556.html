      I am sorry to ask that, but why not (dual-)licensing it with a GPL-compatible license ? After all the subject matter is under the GPL.<br>

      Why not dual-license it under the GPL?  I guess because none of us saw a reason to do that.  Who would benefit?  Remember that the examples are already separately licensed dual BSD/GPL, so there's no problem with the code...

      The GPL really isn't appropriate for books. It's very particularly targeted to code rather than text or other media. What does "linking" mean in a non-code context, hmm?<br>
<p>
Licensing text is rather different from licensing code. There are different priorities people apply when the copyrighted work is code as opposed to text or music.  It's hard to even determine what would constitute "free" when these priorities come into play.  I'll skip the 30-page essay on the tip of my tongue and just vaguely refer to all the various fights over the "free"ness of the GFDL as an illustration of the problems.<br>
<p>
Back to the topic, since I don't remember commenting on earlier articles about it... Congratulations, Jon!  I'm glad to see the results of your efforts.  I personally don't write very much OS-level code, but if I did, this is the book I'd want.  Thanks for licensing it nicely!<br>

<p>
The GPL does not speak of 'linking': the only use of the verb 'to link' in the GPL text is in the last sentence advertising the LGPL.<br>
<p>
So far no one has presented arguments that the GPL was not suitable to text that was backed by the actual GPL text.<br>

      So, you're right that it doesn't mention linking... much.  "This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library."<br>
<p>
But that was just one example of my point.  Maybe the fact that the GPL uses the word "Program" more than fifty times, and the word "document" once, and only in the context that "Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed."<br>
<p>
You don't suppose a different license might be more appropriate for a document than a license that doesn't even refer to the work it's licensing as a document?<br>

      The word "Program" is not the same as the word "program". "Program" is a technical term for the scope of the GPL that referrs to the work being licensed. It just happens that most Programs are also programs, but it's perfectly acceptable for a Program to be something other than a program.<br>
<p>
Consider the analogous "float an_integer = 3.14".<br>

      You think there are no problems with applying the GPL to documentation?  OK, here's one.  You have a GPLed manual, printed out on paper.  You give it to a friend.  Is that legal?
<p>
Answer: no, unless you jump through some extra hoops.  You need to either provide your friend with the source code for the book (LaTex source, DocBook, OpenOffice file, whatever), or you need to give your friend a written offer, good for three years, to provide the source later on whenever he demands it (though you can charge a fee to cover your expenses in doing this).
<p>
Even if you want to distribute a PDF, you still need to provide the source, since a PDF is not a preferred form for modification.  It will do to put the source on the same FTP or HTTP server.

<p>Actually, since you're a non-comercial redistributor, you simply pass along upstream's offer of access to the preferred format, persuant to GPLv2 clause 3c.

<p>The obvious place to use GPL for documentation is for HTML docs, or online docs with builtin hyperlinks to SGML or XML source, etc.  In that case the "Master copy is at [URL]" header serves as the aforementioned upstream written offer, regardless of how the thing gets subsequently redistributed.

<p>And that's pretty much what <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonsoftware-copyleft.html">Michael Stutz wrote</a>, too.

      Just got a printed version as well from an online book store. Looks very nice, indeed.<br>
<p>
Do you use any open source tool (ie. a fo processor) to produce pdf and html version of LDD3? <br>

      I have a question: if I translate the book to other languages, and provides it on the internet for free for everybody, is that legal or not?<br>
<p>
And what if my translation is printed by a publisher, is that legal or not?<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>

      I am waiting to buy the book, meanwhile I downloaded the PDF's. It helps me wait for the book while it arrives. No bookstores in Bangalore have the original edition, claiming that an Indian edition should be on its way soon. Unfortunately for me shipping from the US is very expensive, almost half the cost of the book<br>

      A suggestion:<br>
<p>
On the top page of the LDD Third Edition (i.e. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3">http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3</a>) would it be possible to add a sentence, as is covered in the text of the book, explaining that this book only covers Kernel 2.6 (and presumably higher) and that LDD Second Edition covers Kernel 2.2 and 2.4, with a link to the LDD Second Edition online edition?<br>
<p>
Regards<br>

      One topic that I'd really like to see as an addendum, or in LDD4 ;-) is 64 bit compatibility. Either as a new chapter, or distributed through the book.<br>
<p>
E.g Cover compat_ioctl vs unlocked_ioctl, DMA, 64/32 compatibility etc.<br>
<p>
Does anybody have any pointers to existing online text on this subjecct?<br>

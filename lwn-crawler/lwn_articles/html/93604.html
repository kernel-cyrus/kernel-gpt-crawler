<h1>Addressing latency problems in 2.6</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 14, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The 2.6 kernel is becoming increasingly stable, and the user base is,
correspondingly, becoming happier.  There is, however, one remaining group of
disgruntled users out there: multimedia users and developers who depend on
very quick response times from the kernel.  Whether you are capturing a
video stream, playing a movie, or burning a disc, you need the system to
respond very quickly when the hardware involved needs attention.  Failure
to respond in time leads to buffer overruns or underruns; those, in turn,
lead to video degradation, audio skips, writable media which is suitable
only for use as drink coasters or grade-school art projects, and flames on
various mailing lists.
<p>
The traffic has been growing in recent times, as it has become clear that
some in the multimedia community <a href="/Articles/93605/">feel
discriminated against</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	"We" (the audio developer community) did not participate because it
	was made clear that our needs were not going to be considered. We
	were told that the preemption patch was sufficient to provide "low
	latency", and that rescheduling points dotted all over the place
	was bad engineering (probably true). With this as the pre-rendered
	verdict, there's not a lot of point in dedicating time to tracking
	a situation that clearly is not going to work.
</div>
<p>
The result of this discussion has been a renewed interest among the kernel
developers in fixing this particular problem.  It is pretty universally
believed that the latency issue should be close to resolved, and that it is
just a matter of fixing a few remaining trouble spots.
<p>
One approach that has been taken is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/93124/">voluntary preemption patch</a> put
together by Ingo Molnar and Arjan van de Ven.  This patch tries to reduce
latency by adding more scheduling points - essentially the approach that
was taken back in the 2.4 days.  Some things were done a little
differently, however.  
<p>
The 2.6 kernel contains a hundred or so calls to <tt>might_sleep()</tt>.
This function is a debugging aid; it is a way of marking functions which
can sleep.  If <tt>might_sleep()</tt> finds itself being called in a
situation where sleeping is not allowed (while a spinlock is held, for
example) it complains loudly and, hopefully, the problem gets fixed.  Ingo
and Arjan noted that any place which calls <tt>might_sleep()</tt> is, by
definition, a good place to perform scheduling.  So the voluntary
preemption patch adds a <tt>cond_reschedule()</tt> call to <tt>might_sleep()</tt>,
allowing a higher-priority process to be scheduled, should such a process
exist.  This tweak yields over 100 scheduling points without having to
actually go into the code in that many places.
<p>
While they were at it, Ingo and Arjan also added a few scheduling points in
places that needed them, and also split up code in a couple of places which
were holding locks for too long.
<p>
This patch was not welcomed by everybody.  In the mainline kernel, the
<tt>might_sleep()</tt> call can be configured out entirely for production
kernels; it is a pure debugging aid.  The voluntary preemption patch turns
it into a scheduler function and makes its presence required in production
kernels.  Some developers would rather see explicit rescheduling calls
added in the places where they make sense.
<p>
The strongest objection, however, would appear that the 2.6 kernel already
implements <i>involuntary</i> preemption via the preemptable kernel
option.  Any place which calls <tt>might_sleep()</tt> is already, by
definition, preemptable, so the voluntary preemption patch adds nothing
which the kernel can't already do.  <a href="/Articles/93607/">Says Andrew
Morton</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And please let me repeat: preemption is the way in which we wish to
	provide low-latency.  At this time, patches which sprinkle
	cond_resched() all over the place are unwelcome.  After 2.7 forks
	we can look at it again.
</div>
<p>
So why are some developers pursuing the voluntary preemption patch?  At
this time, very few distributors are shipping 2.6 kernels with kernel
preemption turned on, mostly out of fear of creating stability problems.
Kernel preemption is, itself, reasonably well debugged at this point, but
it has, over the last year or so, shaken out a fair number of bugs in other
parts of the kernel.  Few such bugs have been found recently, but the
distributors continue to take a conservative approach.  Users often find
bugs in surprising places, and bugs related to preemption can be incredibly
difficult to reproduce and track down.  The voluntary preemption patch is a
way of getting some of the benefits of kernel preemption without turning on
a configuration option that the distributors find scary.
<p>
Andrew has often stated his wish to have the mainline kernel meet the needs
of the distributors, so <a href="/Articles/93608/">he may eventually merge
the patch</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Oh I can buy the make-the-bugs-less-probable practical argument,
	but sheesh.  If you insist on going this way we can stick the patch
	in after 2.7 has forked.  I spose.  The patch will actually slow
	the rate of improvement of the kernel :(
</div>
<p>
Meanwhile, the effort to find the real latency issues is going forward.
William Lee Irwin and Con Kolivas have put together <a
href="/Articles/93446/">a patch</a> which tries to track down high-latency
parts of the kernel.  It works by making a note of when kernel code
disables preemption (usually by taking a spinlock) and when preemption is
turned back on again.  If preemption is disabled for too long, a message is
printed stating where the problem is to be found.
<p>
ALSA users who are experiencing latency problems, and who would like to
help track them down, should also be aware of the <tt>xrun_debug</tt>
knob.  It is described in <a
href="/Articles/93609/">sound/alsa/ProcFile.txt</a> in the
<tt>Documentation</tt> directory.  Turning this option on causes a message
and a kernel stack trace whenever an audio device suffers from a buffer
overrun or underrun.  This information can often be used to find the source
of latency issues in short order.

<p>
Thanks to the preempt-timing patch and <tt>xrun_debug</tt>, a few suspects
have been turned up already.  Console scrolling turns
out to be one of them.  ReiserFS has also come up a few times as being a
source of high latency, to the point that its use in latency-critical
situations is being discouraged.  Ext3 has been shown to be the source
of a few problems as well; the -mm tree currently contains a set of
patches aimed at fixing the worst of those.  Another problem can be driver
<tt>ioctl()</tt> methods, which run with the big kernel lock held.  This
process is just beginning, however.
<p>
Yet another approach can be found in <a href="/Articles/93613/">this
patch</a> by Joe Korty.  Software interrupts have been fingered as a
potential source of latency problems; they take priority over regular
kernel code, and have no real, hard limit on how long they can run.  Joe's
patch pushes all software interrupt handling into the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt>
daemon, giving the scheduler a say on when they run.  In this way,
high-priority user processes will see lower latencies - at the expense of
higher latency for the handling of software interrupts.

<p>
Tracking down and fixing the remaining latency problems may take a little
while.  But enough attention is now being focused on the problem that its
resolution seems pretty well assured.  The complete solution, however,
requires enabling kernel preemption, meaning that, for the time being,
2.6 users in search of low latency will have to build and install their own
kernels.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Why isn't spinlocks turned into real mutexes such they don't prevent<br>preemtion in general but only other threads from entering the protected area?<br>That way subsystem like ReifersFS or the console driver is not blocking the<br>whole system but only those threads/processes calling into those things. The multimedia players will still get scheduled if it has higher priority and don't enter those areas. Just as it would in a SMP machine on another CPU.

      Because of the Big Kernel Lock, aka BKL.  This was created as a way for the lazy to make old code 'SMP-safe' without having to implement proper, fine grained locking.  This is a global lock, which differs from a spinlock in that it's recorsive and you can sleep while holding it.  Unfortunately it disables preemption!<br>
<p>
The problem with a facility like this is people will abuse it, because it's the easiest way to implement locking in your code, and before the kernel became preemptible, there was no cost to using the BKL vs. a proper lock on a UP.  Many would have you think that the BKL is mostly a thing of the past, but it is still used, for example by ReiserFS for *all write locking*!<br>
<p>
Many of the latency issues that have been eliminated recently in 2.6 involved eliminating or minimizing uses of the BKL.  It has been suggested that the best way for a newbie to get up to speed on kernel hacking is to find a use of the BKL and replace it with a proper lock.  Quoth Uresh Vahalia:<br>
<p>
"System performance depends greatly on the locking granularity".<br>

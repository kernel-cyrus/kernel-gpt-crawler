<h1>The problem with the asynchronous bsg interface</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 19, 2018</br>
           </div>
The kernel supports two different "SCSI generic" pseudo-devices, each of
which allows user space to send arbitrary commands to a SCSI-attached
device.  Both SCSI-generic implementations have proved to have security
issues in the past as a result of the way their API was designed.  In the
case of one of those drivers, these problems seem almost certain to lead to the
removal of a significant chunk of functionality in the 4.19 development
cycle.
<p>
The SCSI standard is generally thought of as a way to control storage
devices, such as disk and tape drives (younger readers, ask a coworker
what the latter were).  But SCSI can be thought of as a sort of network
protocol with more general capabilities, as demonstrated by its use to
control tape-changing robots, scanners, optical-disk writers, and more.  
Drivers for such devices tend to run in user space; to support those
drivers, the SCSI generic (SG) interface was created.  This interface provides
direct access to
the SCSI protocol, allowing user-space code to control devices in ways not
supported by the in-kernel disk and tape drivers.
<p>
The original SG interface was simply called "<a href="http://sg.danny.cz/sg/"><tt>sg</tt></a>"; like the
"<tt>sd</tt>" 
driver for SCSI disks and "<tt>st</tt>" driver for tape drives, its name
highlights 
the SCSI developers' focus on efficiency, in that no letters were wasted.  The sg
driver implements a low-level device that interfaces directly with the SCSI
midlayer.  Back in 2004, Jens Axboe <a href="/Articles/96547/">posted a new
implementation</a> that he called "<tt>bsg</tt>"; unlike <tt>sg</tt>, it worked at the level
of the block layer, taking advantage of its request-queue infrastructure to
manage SCSI operations.

It took a while, but <tt>bsg</tt> was finally merged for the 2.6.23 release in
2007.  Since then, both interfaces have coexisted in the kernel.  The <tt>sg</tt>
interface retains a number of users; older code makes up some of them, but
some users have found that it works better for their needs (as will be
revisited below).  The <tt>bsg</tt> interface, instead, is the only way to gain
access to some newer SCSI protocol features.
<p>
Both devices implement two different APIs to accomplish the same task.  The
synchronous interface uses <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands; results of operations
are returned when <tt>ioctl()</tt> returns.  There is also an asynchronous
interface based on simple <tt>read()</tt> and
<tt>write()</tt> calls, where one uses <tt>write()</tt> to issue a command,
followed by a later <tt>read()</tt> to obtain the results.  The system
calls involved are simple, but the data that 
is transferred is not:  SCSI commands are executed by writing an <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.17.8/source/include/scsi/sg.h#L43"><tt>sg_io_hdr</tt>
structure</a> to the device.  The structure is complex in its own right,
but it can also contain pointers to other ranges of user-space memory.
Normally, a <tt>write()</tt> call will not access memory outside of the
provided buffer; with these interfaces, instead, a <tt>write()</tt> call
can cause accesses to memory almost anywhere in the address space.

</blockquote>
<p>
The dangers of this kind of interface have become increasingly clear in
recent years.  In this case, there have been a few security issues related
to indirect memory access through the SG devices.  There is
also the persistent concern that an attacker may succeed in convincing a
setuid program to write the wrong thing to such a device, opening up
another vulnerability.  Worries about this kind of problem led to the
recent rejection of the write-based <a href="/Articles/759499/">filesystem
mounting API</a>.  For SG, though, the interfaces have been
established for a long time, so they cannot be withdrawn without breaking
applications.  
<p>
For <tt>bsg</tt>, though, that may not actually be the case.
<p>
In June, Jann Horn <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180615152335.208202-1-jannh@google.com/">tried to
harden these interfaces</a> by adding more restrictions on the contexts in
which they can be used.  Almost as an aside, the changelog noted that, in
the case of <tt>bsg</tt>, arbitrary access to memory can also happen in a
<tt>release()</tt> call, when the file descriptor is being closed.  That
immediately set off a new round of alarms; even a legitimate user-space
memory access can run into trouble at release time, when that memory may no
longer be present.  The results would be unpredictable — but they would be
predictably bad.
<p>

There was some discussion about how this problem might be fixed, but it
didn't take long for Christoph Hellwig to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180621123431.GA558@infradead.org/">suggest</a>
that the asynchronous side of the <tt>bsg</tt> interface be removed
outright.  There are reasons to believe that it is not actually being used
in the real world, some of which were <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/90063ef3-68fa-e983-9b47-838e6076b0f4@interlog.com/">described</a>
by Douglas Gilbert, the maintainer of the <tt>sg</tt> interface.  Among
other things, if two processes are issuing commands to the same device,
<tt>bsg</tt> is unable to keep the responses straight.  "<q>Once real
world users (needing an async SCSI (or general storage) pass-through) find
out about that bsg 'feature', they don't use it</q>".  Horn <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez3BWeZkW5XG814K4o7p0KWXVm9Gpzh2rTthNei=4fhH-A@mail.gmail.com/">did
some searching</a> in the <a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">Debian
Code Search database</a> and concluded that there were no users that needed
to be worried about.

<p>
The end result of the discussion is that Axboe has <a
href="/Articles/760350/">merged</a> Hellwig's patch to remove the
asynchronous <tt>bsg</tt> functionality.  The synchronous <tt>ioctl()</tt>-based
API, which does 
not have the same problems (and which is actually used by applications),
will remain.  Linus Torvalds has <a href="/Articles/760351/">stated</a>
that this patch should also be applied to the stable kernels as well.  So,
unless some users of the asynchronous API come forward in the near future,
this particular feature will soon disappear.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Actually the first thing which came to my mind was splitting the write command into several, one (at least) for each disjoint chunk of memory.  No need for additional copies there, but it still eliminates the wild pointers.<br>

Advanced applications manage their data buffers in complex ways and try to avoid copying if possible, hence the desire for iovecs in readv()/writev()/sendmsg()/recvmsg()/etc.  sg also supports iovecs for its data buffers.  But sg is more like sendmsg()/recvmsg() where multiple *types* of buffers for different purposes are specified for a single command, e.g. a data buffer for I/O and a "sense" buffer for error information.  Requiring them all to be packed together along with the control header information would make the interface less efficient and more difficult to use.<br>

iovec is an extension of that - you can send multiple chunks at once, but they are still bounded and don't require pointer chasing.<br>

For context, here is how such issues can be abused to corrupt kernel memory, in particular via sys_splice(): <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg36015.html">https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg36015.html</a><br>
<p>
Basically, there are a few places in the kernel (sys_splice() is the most interesting one, but there are others) that call VFS read/write handlers under KERNEL_DS, so that copy_to_user()/copy_from_user() can also access kernel memory; all the copy_to_user()/copy_from_user() calls in VFS read/write context can be treated as essentially equivalent to __copy_from_user()/__copy_to_user(). The buffer/length pair provided to the read/write handler is guaranteed to be safe, but if you either access other random addresses or access the provided buffer beyond the provided length, bad stuff happens.<br>
<p>
One particularly annoying thing about this kind of bug is that KASAN doesn't see the bogus access, and pagefaults on kernel addresses don't trigger oopses (because they are treated as userspace faults, so you just get -EFAULT). So if you hit this kind of bug with something like a fuzzer, you're unlikely to actually notice anything. I wonder whether I should try to write a patch to change that... maybe let the pagefault handler ignore uaccess fixups when KERNEL_DS is active, with an exception for __probe_kernel_read/__probe_kernel_write or so?<br>
<p>
Another slightly related bug, from 2016: <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=822">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id...</a> - this one wasn't in VFS context, but in handler code for performance counter overflows, which can trigger in pretty much any context.<br>
<p>
Another related bug (not from me): <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=717adfdaf14704fd3ec7fa2c04520c0723247eac">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/...</a> - this one is an overflow beyond the end of the provided buffer in a debugfs read handler; if you are root and fiddle around with splice a bit, you can get this to overflow beyond the pipe page, crashing the machine.<br>

"There are reasons to believe that it is not actually being used in the real world"<br>
<p>
In one of my past job I extended sg to support AIO. AIO, SCSI and per-IO SCSI sense codes were required for our proprietary datapath running in userspace. So there are users, they are just under the radar.<br>

Yes, it was just a side note, that not all API users are immediately visible.<br>

Wouldn't it have been better to use writev(2) instead of write(2)? I think that would allow you to "write" all the data at once, and still have zero extra userspace memcpy's.<br>

Interesting idea, but it is more complicated than that.  In the sg API, the write() syscall means "start a command" and the read() syscall means "get command completion result".  The command may be a SCSI READ, SCSI WRITE, or something else.  So you can start a SCSI READ command with a write() syscall, and you can get the command completion of a SCSI WRITE command with a read() syscall.  Add in direct I/O, and you will never be able to simplify the API down to the original syscall meanings.  Essentially, the sg read()/write() syscalls behave more like ioctl().<br>
<p>
Here is an example:<br>
<p>
Example: SCSI READ command using direct I/O<br>
allocate buffer to hold data being read<br>
start SCSI READ command via write() syscall to sg, passing address of buffer<br>
wait for command completion; SCSI HBA DMAs directly to buffer<br>
use read() syscall to sg to get command result<br>
<p>
If using indirect I/O, you could design an interface where the buffer was passed to the read() syscall at command completion (although the sg driver doesn't work like that).  But using direct I/O, the kernel needs the buffer when the command is started, so it is passed in the write() syscall.  So there is no way to map "start a command" to the original meaning of the write() (or writev()) syscall using direct I/O.  It makes more sense to think of it as an ioctl().<br>

<p>
While it is quite common for consumer electronics&mdash;TVs, DVRs,
and the like&mdash;to be running Linux these days, it is less common to see
projects geared towards replacing and upgrading the Linux firmware in that
class of devices.  But that is exactly what the <a
href="http://samygo.sourceforge.net/">SamyGO</a> project is doing for
Samsung televisions. By using the source provided by Samsung, along with
quite a bit of ingenuity, SamyGO allows users to telnet into their
television&mdash;an amusing concept&mdash;but also to enable functionality
beyond that which ships with the device.
</p>

<p>
The SamyGO wiki <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=Main_Page">lists</a>
several modifications that can be made to the TV firmware.  One of the main
modifications seems to be enabling NFS or SMB/CIFS support so that media
files from servers on the network can be played.  The TVs already support
getting media from the local network using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">Digital
Living Network Alliance</a> (DLNA) protocols, but there are 
restrictions on the audio and video formats and some playback functionality
(pause, forward, rewind) depending on the DLNA server.  By using NFS
or CIFS, all of the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=Media_Play_and_DLNA">formats</a>
and features
available for USB-based playback are also available across the network.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, these are fairly high-end TVs, with both Ethernet connectivity
and USB ports.  The <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=Service_Manuals">devices</a>
"supported" by SamyGO are LCD models in the LE-32-55Bxxx series and LED
models from the UE-xx-B70xx series.  The USB ports are available for
viewing/playing 
additional media or for games.  Using the "Games" menu with
programs stored on a USB stick is one of the ways to run programs on the TV. 
</p>

<p>
The USB ports are also used for a Samsung-branded WiFi "dongle" that
owners can buy to avoid the wiring hassle of Ethernet.  But, Linux supports
far more wireless devices than just the Samsung devices, so SamyGO
developers are working to enable others as well.  In fact, the Ralink
<tt>rt73</tt> and <tt>rt2870</tt> drivers have been <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/samygo/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=14#p42">modified</a>
in the kernel source supplied by Samsung to remove many additional device
IDs, so that only the Samsung devices will work. There are now <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=How_to_enable_Telnet/NFS/CIFS/SAMBA#WiFi">drivers</a>
available without that restriction. 
</p>

<p>
The early efforts have been to get telnet working so that the
TV filesystem could be explored.  This is done by <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=How_to_enable_Telnet_on_samsung_TV's">patching
the firmware binaries</a> 
provided by 
Samsung and then using the TV's firmware upgrade mechanism to install them
on the device.  The aptly named "<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/samygo/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3">Warning
: Read Me First or Brick Your TV!</a>" message in the SamyGO <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/samygo/index.php">forum</a>
outlines the dangers of upgrading the firmware.  For those that just want
to try this all out, without upgrading any firmware, a safer method is also
described, which masquerades as a game on a USB stick to enable telnet.
</p>

<p>
The kernel is 2.6.18-based with the addition of Samsung's <a
href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/flash/Products_RFS_Brochure.html">Robust
FAT File System</a> (RFS), which is a filesystem for NAND flash devices.  As
the name would indicate, it is also FAT compatible.  It is not in the
mainline, however, nor have the SamyGO developers gotten it working for
desktop distributions.  For that reason, they have resorted to binary
patching of the firmware.
</p>

<p>
Samsung has also released RFS source, along with a <a
href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/flash/Products_RFS_PortingGuide.html">Linux
porting guide</a> that should be helpful in those efforts.  
Once RFS can be built for recent kernels, or a utility to create RFS images
is made, 
developers will be able to build their own firmware images for these TVs.
[ <b>Update</b>: see the comments below, there is no source RFS release. ]
</p>

<p>
The kernel source is <a
href="http://www.samsung.com/global/opensource/">available</a>, but the
project has not yet released any kernels built from it.  The Ralink drivers
were rebuilt 
after modifying the device IDs, though, so they can be inserted into the
system.  The kernel itself has been 
patched, adding OMAP architecture and sound support among other things, but
there has been no mention of binary drivers on the forum, so it should be
possible to build the released kernel&mdash;or something more recent.


<p>
So far, Samsung doesn't seem to have reacted to the project, either
positively or negatively.  Some concern has been expressed in the forum
that working around the WiFi restrictions might raise the company's ire.
But one would guess that the number of folks willing to risk bricking an
expensive TV in order to use a cheaper WiFi dongle is relatively
small&mdash;likely to go unnoticed by Samsung.  

<p>
In the meantime, if the
SamyGO hackers add other functionality that might be interesting to
customers&mdash;there has been talk of web browsers for
example&mdash;Samsung might just adopt it themselves.  Either way, the code
is out there for those who might want to give it a try.

The article claims that samsung has released the RFS sources. Where? On the mentioned page there is no download and the downloadable kernel source for this device contains binary object files for RFS only. Samsung also states that RFS is not GPL but proprietary. So porting RFS to a newer kernel will apparently be a big problem.<br>

<p>
You are indeed correct, and I will try to reflect that in the article.  I saw rfs directories and such included with the source, along with some forum comments, and leapt to a conclusion.  Interesting that they would provide object files for a binary-only module, doesn't seem like they would need to do that (assuming that the binary module is not a derivative work, which would, of course, require the source to be released as well).<br>
<p>
My apologies, and thanks for pointing it out!<br>

That's not necessarily true, one of the classic early examples of a kernel module that couldn't possibly be a derived work of the kernel was the Andrew File System that did use pre-existing code ported across.<br>

"a derived work of it since it cannot have been created for another <br>
operating system"<br>
<p>
This is one of the most ridiculous definitions of "derivative work" ever <br>
conceived. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br>
<p>
Two classic tests for derivative work are "access" and "substantial <br>
similarity".  Access is a given here.  But why should a filesystem first <br>
developed for Linux necessarily have greater similarity to other operating <br>
system source code than one that was ported from another operating system?<br>
<p>
A difference so great that one is a derivative work and the other one <br>
isn't?  The end products are nearly equivalent.  Both rely on access to the <br>
Linux source code. The order of development or porting is completely <br>
irrelevant - either both (in their final form) are derivative works of <br>
Linux or both aren't.<br>
<p>
And the theory that either one is a derivative work is pretty thin in any <br>
case.  Is a Windows application a derivative work of Windows because that <br>
is the first platform it was developed for?  Because it makes extensive use <br>
of hundreds of Win32 APIs?  What about a business management application <br>
that relies on the special features of a certain database?  Should it be <br>
developed for some brain dead database first, just so it can avoid the <br>
accusation of being a derived work of the good one?<br>
<p>
Is the contagion of being ported to a kernel or operating system so great, <br>
that the taint can never be removed in a version for a different kernel or <br>
operating system.  That is what SCO's theory was.  Derivative status as a <br>
viral construct.<br>

It's also completely irrelevant; I'm disappointed that johill brought it up.
<P>
It actually doesn't matter at all whether the module is a derived work. Let's consider it, for the sake of argument, to be an independent and separate work in itself. And then let's see what the GPL has to say...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

That's the nVidia situation which giggls mentioned <I>(given the above-stated assumption, for the sake of argument, that it's not a derived work)</I>.
<BR>But read on...
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> But when you

And that's the Samsung situation. Looks like a clear GPL violation to me.
<P>
Even if the module is <em>not</em> a derived work.

As long as you are not *surprised* someone brought it up.  It is a rare occasion that a product using Linux is discussed on LWN without a sub-thread about the GPL and derived work.  <br>
<p>
Have there been any concrete court decisions in this field lately?  I am tired of hearing peoples unprovable interpretations of a derived work.  I would love to know what a derived work really is, but have searched far and wide with no solid answers.<br>

      You're right; the GPL can't <em>directly</em> affect those other works, which are 
<i>"independent and separate works in themselves."</i> All it can do is grant or 
deny you permission to copy, modify and distribute the original GPL'd work.
<p>
It can grant you permission with <em>conditions</em> attached. Copyright law 
does allow that. And unless you abide by those conditions, you don't have permission 
to distribute the original GPL'd work.
<p>
So I can release code under a licence which says <i>"you can only use this if you send 
me a postcard,"</i> or <i>"if you name you first-born son after me,"</i> or <i>"if all 
software you ever write is released under the GPL,"</i> or <i>"if I like your 
face."</i>
<p>It's my prerogative to grant or deny permission to use my own code as I 
see fit, under copyright law.
<p>
And I most certainly <em>can</em> release it under a licence which says that you 
may only redistribute it if you <em>don't</em> do so in combination with other 
software which is under 
a different licence. Copyright law most definitely does allow that, and that's what 
the GPL does.

Interesting.  If I am understanding you correctly, you are saying that anyone who distributes a Linux kernel with a binary driver (many, if not most, embedded Linux devices out there would qualify) is in violation of the GPL.<br>

Not an interpretation I had heard (or, perhaps more likely, understood) before.<br>

Given the above direct quote from the §2 of the GPL, I find it hard to find an alternative interpretation. Although I understand that some people don't <em>like</em> it, so they'll clutch at straws to find one.
<P>
One of the tenuous counter-arguments which is often presented (other than the <i>"copyright law doesn't allow that"</i> fallacy) is the final paragraph of §2, which states that <I>"mere aggregation ... on a volume of a storage or distribution medium"</I> doesn't count.
<P>Some people argue that that "exception" is so wide-ranging that it might as well be rephrased as <I>"Oh, actually just disregard the previous two paragraphs, even where we explicitly spelled out that we meant this to apply even to works which are independent and separate works in themselves; we didn't really mean  that."</I>
<P>Some people go so far as to claim that <em>all</em> forms of "aggregation" are permitted by the exception &mdash; so since linking to non-GPL'd work is merely a form of aggregation, that's allowed too. Under that interpretation, the GPL would actually become more like the LGPL.
<P>Personally, I feel it's much more likely that that "exception" clause applies to stuff like magazine cover CDs, where mostly unrelated software is just aggregated together for distribution. Or where it happens to sit on the same hard drive or backup tape as if by coincidence.<P>
I definitely don't believe that any sane interpretation of the "mere aggregation" exception can apply to a coherent product where both the GPL'd work and the non-GPL'd work are fundamental and necessary parts without which it could not operate.
<P>
But of course nobody is right or wrong until it's been heard in court.

      <blockquote><i>But of course nobody is right or wrong until it's been heard in court.</i></blockquote>

<p>&lt;completly off-topic rant&gt;</p>

<p>Just for the record, the quoted statement would only be true if courts could never be wrong. That is, if they had an authoritative say on what the law should be.</p>

<p>As a (non common law) lawyer, I take exception at this view. Judges are just opinionated people who have been handed some robes (and in the UK maybe some wigs) by the politicians. They are just as likely to make mistakes as the next guy. They are not inherently more likely to be right than anybody else, even <i>*gasp*</i> non-lawyers. Of course, judges themselves know this, and they therefore appreciate a well reasoned argument, no matter who makes it. Generally speaking, even after having decided a case.</p>

<p>Of course, in practice the legal traditions work out to be remarkably similar. But I really do blame the case law system with it's principle of <i>stare decisis</i> for instilling such an attitude of unreflected acceptance in otherwise critically thinking legal laymen.</p>

<p>SCNR &lt;/completly off-topic rant&gt;</p>

      I understand your objection; allow me to rephrase that final sentence for you, to properly express the implicit subtext...<P>

But nobody is right or wrong; it's not black and white. It's just a document written in English and there can be many different interpretations of it; ranging from the sane interpretations to the utterly nonsensical ones such as the <I>"counter-arguments"</I> I mentioned above.<P>
There are very few interpretations which actually <em>matter</em>, though. The first one which matters to you might be the opinion of your company lawyer, when you consider shipping a product which violates the GPL by including both a kernel and a binary-only module in the same coherent whole. Or, as the GPL phrases it, in a <i>"derivative <b>or collective</b> work based on"</I> Linux.<P>

If he is doing his job properly, he will prevent you from doing that. On the other hand if he <em>doesn't</em> do his job properly, you may well end up bumping up against an opinion which takes precedence over his &mdash; the opinion expressed by the (<i>final appeal</i>) court when you are sued for copyright violation.
<P>
That opinion, ultimately, is the only one which <em>really</em> matters. It doesn't make it <em>right</em>, and there's plenty of examples of cases where the courts have got things "wrong" in the eyes of many people. But it <em>is</em> the only interpretation which really matters in the end, in practical terms.<P>
Unless, of course, you think the revolution is going to be triggered by a copyright case... :)

I think the implication against joint (collective) distribution is entirely <br>
reasonable.  My problem is when people say something like "this filesystem <br>
was first developed for Linux", therefore it (in any form) is a derived <br>
work of the Linux kernel, and that derivative status infects it to the <br>
degree that it remains a derivative work even when all the Linux related <br>
code is stripped out.<br>
<p>
That was SCO's theory regarding JFS.  It was first developed for a <br>
proprietary Unix licensed from source code SCO claimed it had the copyright <br>
to, therefore (so they claimed) any version for any other operating system <br>
was also a derivative work of Unix System V (and they were owed billions in <br>
royalties).<br>
<p>
I call that the "derivative work by contagion" theory, and it is one of the <br>
reasons why people shouldn't blindly go around claiming things are <br>
derivative works when there is no rational theory for why that should be <br>
the case. Combination may produce a copyright protected collective work, <br>
but the mere fact of combination certainly does not necessarily infect each <br>
of the original components with derivative status when considered <br>
separately, and more especially when the kernel specific binding code is <br>
removed.  That would be like saying if a photo is printed in a magazine, <br>
not only is the photo a derivative work of the magazine, the magazine is a <br>
derivative work of the photo.  <br>

The fun thing about IBM's JFS as available in the Linux kernel was that
the JFS code IBM contributed to Linux didn't in fact have anything to do
with
the JFS code in AIX (which SCO claimed was a derived work of Unix).
</p>
<p>
The Linux JFS code is a port of the reimplementation from scratch of JFS
that IBM did for OS/2, so it couldn't have been »infected« with SCO-owned
code because it never actually came in contact with any.

      Samsung's RFS page kills me - they add a journal to FAT, tweak it for flash and call it <i>robust</i> <b>FAT</b> filesystem.  Ye gads, FAT itself is about the most trivial file system you can get, and making it robust... there's only so much you can do and still be FAT compatible.  And then they go to all the effort to keep it binary only, with the GPL shim layer.
<p>
I see companies do this all the time: some engineer adds 1 + 1 and suddenly the company treats it likes it's a prize possession, and then they jump through hoops to keep the fact that they added 1+1 a huge secret.  When in reality the engineer probably did it as a quick one-off, with little thought and almost zero experience in what he was doing (<i>state of the art filesystem design</i> - yeah, right).  As such, it's probably got a couple dozen stupid bugs and could do for some serious peer review.  
<p>
Just release the code Samsung - if it's any good, the community will incorporate it and it'll get even better.  And if it sucks, the community will probably fix it.  And the amount of value you're getting from using Linux vastly outweighs any benefit some competitor of yours might get by seeing this silly journalling FAT filesytem. 
<p>
Oh, and get this: if you google for "journaling FAT", the first result is a PATENT on such a thing.  The idiots at the PTO strike again.  And there are dozens of other journaling or robust FAT filesystem results.

This is actually pretty normal.<br>
<p>
Microsoft themselves have 'Transaction Safe' FAT version they offer for <br>
embedded systems running Windows CE 5.x (and probably others). Since people <br>
expect that it's 'ok' to simply pull the power from handheld devices and <br>
such then it's obvious that FAT itself is not really that suitable. <br>
Customers will have a strong tendency to corrupt things after a while. So <br>
transaction safe FAT is designed to deal with that.<br>
<p>
It's simply a FAT file system with two file allocation tables. I guess the <br>
goal is to make file system changes a fully atomic event.<br>
<p>
And the Linux FAT driver actually works with it, mostly. You can read from <br>
it quite easily, and write. I don't think it's a good idea to use the file <br>
system back in the embedded system after that.. but it's easily to pull the <br>
information off of one.<br>

I know it's normal.  That's my main point: what on earth does Samsung think they are gaining by trying to keep their super-duper RFS secret?<br>
<p>
It was also to point out that companies need to start understanding that 99% of the stuff their engineers come up with is totally obvious and has been done before (and is even patented in this case), so that they don't end up wasting vast quantities of everyone's time and money on silly crap like the GPL shim layer.  Not that the stuff is useless, but come on, a *television* company doing "state of the art" filesystem work.  GET REAL...<br>

Wow that's a lot of assumptions there, like that things are *ever* that simple. Okay, sometimes things are that simple, but most of the time, when something's screaming "this is so simple why can't they see it?" at you, that's usually a strong sign that it's not and there are other factors you're not considering. As much as there are GPL constraints pulling in one direction, there's a fair chance that there are several other licenses on what they can do with the code pulling them in other directions. For a start, we know it's a VFAT compatible filesystem, and from what we've seen recently with TomTom, Microsoft's ownership of that IP will stand up in court, which means chances are Samsung (or "Flash Software Group") currently have a licensing agreement with MS to allow them to use the code, and who knows whom else they've licensed code or other IP that covers what else they can do with it. Judging by the fact that there's other open source driver downloads on their website for other parts of the system or other products, I'm definitely inclined to believe that it's simply a case of contending licensing issues... <br>
<p>
But really, it's a FAT based filesystem that open implementations can still read/write to should the need be there, who cares? Let 'em have their locked away filesystem add-ons, there's so much better out there and on the way.<br>
<p>
As far as patenting goes, that covers implementation, if they do their transactional IO differently then it doesn't come under that patent, and if they don't do it different, then the patent holder is probably just someone else who Samsung have a licensing agreement with adding constraints. It's just business.<br>

Er, didn't the FAT filesystem *always* have two file allocation tables? 
(Or did FAT32 drop one of them? I had switched to Linux everywhere and 
stopped paying much attention to such sucky filesystems by then.)

The point where you get transaction safety with FATfs is when each of the two FAT copies resides on exactly one erase block of the underlying flash, and you do all updates as a copy-on-write operation, like:<br>
<p>
1. write modified data blocks and directories in previously unused clusters of the file system, without updating the FAT<br>
2. erase the first copy of the FAT<br>
3. write the modified FAT with the new state to the first copy<br>
4. erase the second copy of the FAT<br>
5. write the modified FAT with the new state to the second copy<br>
<p>
Upon mounting, you have to detect which copy to use, normally they are identical, and if they are not you should have an out-of-band checksum in the flash that tells you which copy is garbage (unless you have a fatal hardware problem, one of them is guaranteed to be intact) and you overwrite the broken copy with the good one.<br>
<p>
It's an extremely simple operation that works exactly because the FAT design is so trivial that it keeps all block allocation data in one place.<br>
If you file sizes are a large multiple of your cluster size (e.g. when storing audio and video data), it's also highly efficient on flash media.<br>
Considering that FAT was designed for 160kb floppy disks without subdirectories, it works extremely well for todays applications.<br>

Alternate firmware was the main reason I bought a WRT router. I'd not thought about TVs, but if it's relatively foolproof to use alternate firmware (the "bricking" comment hit home), I might well consider the price and equipment upgrade when it comes time for us to upgrade to HD.<br>

The TVs are also freaking gorgeous.  My Samsung Plasma isn't even two years old yet, and I don't even watch much TV, but I drool every time I'm in Fry's and see the high end Samsung LED TVs.  Thin, light, low power, crisp and brilliant images, and good overall design.

I'm no expert but the cost difference and the tendency of the more cost competitive plasmas to be 720p rather than 1080p (like most LCD's these days) had essentially eliminated the plasma market (and coincidentally the DLP market as well). I had also understood that most of the manufacturers had dropped their plasma production and were focusing solely on LCD's these days. <br>

Uhm, no. A "LED" TV is still a LCD TV. The only difference is the backlight source.<br>
<p>
For full LED backlight, the difference from old-style can be quite big through making dynamic contrast being an actual advantage, instead of a liability. With edge LED, which 90% "LED" TVs has, it's not completely the same backlight-bleeding, no-blacks junk, but not that far off.<br>
<p>
When/if we see real OLED TVs, it will probably be another matter. Until then black levels, contrast, screen update (do NOT get me started on "100/200/400 Hz technology") and general quality are all completely in the hands of plasmas.<br>
<p>
Only advantages for LCDs are brightness/anti-glare (if you have a really bright living room, or strong lightsources in front of the screen) and power usage, and maybe small-screen resolution, but 1080 on a 30" set is a joke anyway (unless you sit 1 meter from the screen). Burn-in is a non-issue in modern plasmas.<br>

To be fair, there's one more thing about plasmas that can be hugely annoying to those sensitive to it: phosphor trails.<br>

"The kernel is 2.6.18-based with the addition of Samsung's Robust FAT File System (RFS),..."<br>
<p>
Open access to RFS source trees would make porting forward to current kernel releases possible. This mutual benefit to Samsung and the community is the whole point of open source development. As it stands Samsung must bare the cost of reworking RFS and porting it forward off the past end of life 2.6.18 kernel. <br>
<p>
Developing new projects around 2.6.18 is going to requires a lot of out of tree maintenance. However I am not surprised Samsung developed custom FAT for flash, we nearly did the same. <br>

I would love to replace the firmware on my Westinghouse TX-47F430S -- it has some crippling bugs, like enabling DPMS mode causes the TV to freeze and require a reboot.  I found a firmware image for a similar TV and it is Linux-based, but there is no GPL notice or any source release.  And they never responded to my requests.  At least Samsung is using Linux legally...<br>

I found BusyBox in the image so I sent a letter to gpl@busybox.net.  If anyone else is interested, look at:<br>

Uncompress it, then starting at offset 2601216 in safe-kernel.img1 you'll find a ramdisk image that contains busybox.  There's other stuff around too.<br>

very interesting this SamyGo project. this could bring some interesting new features on a fairly open platform. i hope the same could happen for LG too.<br>
<p>
i have a tv set made by LG 42LH4000 and i found that i can get a boot loader prompt if i press the ESC button on the serial port (using minicom) during power up..<br>
when i have  mstar# i can give lots of commands, for example i can make more verbose the tv set with "silent nothing" and at next reboot see the kernel dmesg.<br>
<p>
i'm looking to put in place a community like the samsung one. if there's people interested let's try to do something together!<br>

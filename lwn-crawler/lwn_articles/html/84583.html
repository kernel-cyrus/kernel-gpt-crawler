<h1>4K Stacks in 2.6</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 12, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Traditionally, the Linux kernel has used 8KB kernel stacks on most
architectures.  That stack must suffice for any sequence of calls that may
result from a system call - plus the needs of any (hard or soft) interrupt
handlers that may be invoked at the same time.  In practice, stack
overflows are pretty much unheard of in stable kernels; the kernel
developers have long since learned to avoid large automatic variables,
recursive functions, and other things which can use large amounts of stack
space. 
<p>
There have been patches circulating for some time now which reduce the
kernel stack to 4KB.  It is generally understood that the switch to smaller
stacks will happen at some point; as a result, much work has recently gone
into finding code paths in the kernel which are overly stack-hungry.  Part
of that effort is simply lots of testing; for that reason, recent -mm
kernels no longer even offer an 8KB stack option.  The hope is that, if
enough people try out the smaller stacks and shake out the bugs, 4KB stacks
can be merged into 2.6 in the near future.
<p>

The smaller stacks are scary to some people; it is hard to be certain that
all of the possible paths through the kernel have actually been tested.
4KB stacks also break binary modules, and the nVidia drivers in
particular.  So there is a certain amount of pressure to defer this change
into 2.7.
<p>

One might well wonder why the kernel hackers are trying to put this sort of
change into a stable kernel series.  The problem with 8KB stacks is that
they require an "order&nbsp;1" memory allocation: two pages which are
contiguous in physical memory.  Order&nbsp;1 allocations can be very hard
to satisfy once the system has been running for a while; physical memory
can become so fragmented that two adjacent free pages simply do not exist.
The kernel will try hard to free up pages to satisfy larger allocations;
the result can be a slow, painful, thrashing system.
<p>

Each process on the system has its own kernel stack, which is used whenever
the system goes into kernel mode while that process is running.  Since each
process requires a kernel stack, the creation of a new process requires an
order&nbsp;1 allocation.  So the two-page kernel stacks can limit the
creation of new processes, even though the system as a whole is not
particularly short of resources.  Shrinking kernel stacks to a single page
eliminates this problem and makes it easy for Linux systems to handle far
more processes at any given time.  
<p>

Arjan van de Ven also <a href="/Articles/84592/">made the interesting
claim</a> that the 4KB stacks are actually safer.  His reasoning has to do
with one other aspect of the 4KB stack patch: it moves interrupt handling
onto a separate, dedicated stack.  Software interrupts also get their own
stack.  Since interrupt handling has been moved away from the per-process
kernel stack, the amount of space for system call handling remains about
the same, and the stack space for interrupts has been increased.
<p>
The final decision on the integration of 4KB stacks has not yet been made;
there are, seemingly, a few problems which still need to be tracked down.
If things settle out, however, this fairly significant change could yet be
merged into 2.6.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Well, yes, but with a config option to stick with 8k stacks for now.  I guess that removing that option is the controversial bit!

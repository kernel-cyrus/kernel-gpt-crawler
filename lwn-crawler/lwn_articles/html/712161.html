Over the last year or more, multiple hardening features have made their way
from the <a href="https://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity</a>/<a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">PaX</a> kernels into the mainline under the <a
href="/Articles/698827/">auspices of the Kernel Self Protection
Project</a>.  One that was added for the 4.8 kernel is the <a
href="/Articles/691102/">GCC plugin infrastructure</a> that allows
processing kernel code during the build to inject various kinds of
protections.  Several plugins have been merged, most notably the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=38addce8b600ca335dc86fa3d48c890f1c6fa1f4">latent_entropy
plugin</a> for 4.9.  Two other plugins have recently been
proposed: kernexec for preventing the kernel from executing user-space code
and structleak to clear structure fields that might be copied to user space.
</p>

<h4>kernexec</h4>

<p>
If the kernel is tricked into executing
user-space memory, that can be used by attackers to subvert the system.
An attacker can run the code of their choice with the kernel's
privileges.   So
the ability to prevent that is an important hardening feature that is
implemented in 
hardware as 
Supervisor Mode Execution Protection (SMEP) on some Intel CPUs and as
Privileged Access Never (PAN) on some ARM systems.
</p>

<p>
For those x86_64 systems that lack SMEP, though, kernexec can provide much
the same protection.   In
  mid-January, Kees Cook <a href="/Articles/711655/">posted</a> an initial
  version of the 
kernexec plugin.  The plugin changes the kernel so that, at run time,
addresses used to make C 
function calls always have the high bit set.  All kernel functions reside
in the kernel address space, which has the high bit set.  Since the Linux
kernel will never map user-space memory at addresses with the high bit set,
attempts to run 
user-space code by overwriting
addresses to point into user space will fail.  Instead of executing code at
the address arranged for by the attacker, the plugin arranges to trigger a
general 
protection fault instead.  Similarly, return addresses are forced at run
time to have 
the high bit set before the return instruction is executed.
</p>

<p>
The performance impact of kernel hardening efforts is always a concern, so
the plugin attempts to optimize the calls and return instructions.  If a
register is
available, the call site simply does a logical-or of the address and
0x8000000000000000 that it loads into the register.  For the return, it
uses a bit-set 
instruction (<tt>btsq</tt>) to set the high bit of the return address on
the stack.
</p>

<p>
Cook notes that there is "<q>significant coverage missing</q>" with
this version of the plugin.  It is missing the assembly language
pieces, which means that assembly code can still make calls into
or return to user-space addresses.  That infrastructure still needs to be
ported over from PaX, he said.
</p>

<a name="structleak"></a>
<h4>structleak</h4>

<p>
Kernel structures (or fields contained within them) are often copied to
user space.  If 
those structures are not initialized, though, they can contain
"interesting" values 
that have lingered in the kernel's memory.  If an attacker can arrange for
those values to line up with the structure and get them copied to user
space, the result is a kernel information leak.  <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2141">CVE-2013-2141</a>
was a leak of that sort; it led "PaX Team" (who develops the PaX patch set)
to create the structleak plugin. 
</p>

<p>
Cook also <a href="/Articles/711692/">posted</a> a port of that plugin to
the kernel mailing list on January&nbsp;13.  It looks for the
<tt>__user</tt> attribute (which is an annotation that is used to indicate
user-space pointers) 
on fields in structures declared as variables local to a
function.  If those variables are not initialized (thus would still contain
"garbage" from the stack), the plugin zeroes them out.  In that way, if
those values get copied to user space at some point, there will be no
exposure of kernel memory contents.
</p>

<p>
PaX Team <a href="/Articles/712506/">commented</a> on the patch posting,
mostly suggesting tweaks to some of the text accompanying the plugin.  In
particular, Cook had changed the description of the plugin in the Kconfig
description from what is in PaX. However, Cook had reasonable <a
href="/Articles/712509/">justifications</a> for most of those changes.

<p>
In addition, 
the wording of a Kconfig option that turns on verbose mode for structleak
(<tt>GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_VERBOSE</tt>) did not meet with PaX Team's approval.
It notes that false positives can be reported since "<q>not all
existing initializers are detected by the plugin</q>", but PaX Team
objected to that characterization: "<q>a variable either has a
constructor or it does not&nbsp;;)</q>".  But Cook looks at things a bit
differently:
<div class="BigQuote">
Well, as pointed out, there are plenty of false positives where the
[plugin] reports the need to initialize the variable when it doesn't. It
doesn't report that it's missing a constructor.&nbsp;:) This is a pragmatic
description of what is happening, and since the plugin does sometimes
needlessly insert initializations where none are needed, that really
seems like a false positive to me.&nbsp;:)
</div>
</p>

<p>
Beyond wording issues, though, as Mark Rutland <a
href="/Articles/712510/">pointed out</a>, the 
<tt>__user</tt> annotation is not a true indication that there is a problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
To me, it seems that the __user annotation can only be an indicator of
an issue by chance. We have structures with __user pointers in structs
that will never be copied to userspace, and conversely we have structs
that don't contain a __user field, but will be copied to userspace.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He suggested that analyzing calls to <tt>copy_to_user()</tt> and friends
might allow better detection.  PaX Team <a
href="/Articles/712512/">agreed</a>, but said that the original idea was to
find a simple pattern to match to eliminate CVE-2013-2141 and other, similar
bugs.  Now that the bug is fixed, it is unclear if the plugin is actually
blocking any problems, but
there is little reason not to keep it, PaX Team <a 
href="/Articles/712514/">said</a>: "<q>i keep this plugin around because
it costs nothing to maintain 
it and the alternative (better) solution doesn't exist yet.</q>"
</p>

<p>
These are both fairly straightforward hardening features that may prevent
kernel bugs from being (ab)used by attackers.  Structleak may not truly be
needed at this point, but new code could introduce a similar problem and
the plugin is not particularly intrusive.  Kernexec, on the
other hand, 
has the potential to stop attacks that rely on the kernel executing
user-space code in their tracks.  While both plugins have existed out of
tree for 
some time, getting them upstream so that distributors can start building
their kernels that way, thus get them in the hands of more Linux users, can
only be a good thing.  Hopefully we will see some of the others make their
way into the mainline before too long as well.

PXN would be the ARM equivalent, not PAN.  Also the description of the KERNEXEC plugin is wrong and mimics the wrong description provided by Kees for the upstream kernel (modified from what was correctly written in PaX, though actually, Kees' description is even more incorrect).  The reason for the GPF (as opposed to some simple non-present page fault) also isn't explained.  The or/bts explanation is wrong.  Lack of assembly modifications results in more than just missing coverage too.  Kees' revisions of the STRUCTLEAK documentation are wrong as well, presumably you echoed that they were "reasonable" because the PaX Team didn't yet respond to that particular part of the mail (he has real work to do, after all, on something I should very much hope LWN writes about when it is released).  The use of 'several' while technically correct suggests more plugins than 3, two of which are trivial.<br>
<p>
This is all old news though, personally I think the more important news is that after over more than a year, the KSPP took a break from plagiarizing and finally contributed code back to grsecurity for the first time: an incomplete typo fix to an error message no one has ever seen in real life.  It's great that they care about the long-term survivability of our work, despite the fact that they can totally exist independently and don't need the PaX Team to spoon-feed them details about how the code they're copy+pasting works.<br>

Kees' description of the KERNEXEC plugin is actually pretty good, as far as I can tell.  The reason for the fault is that setting the high bit on any userspace address will produce a non-canonical address, i.e. an address whose bits 48-63 are not the same as bit 47, which in Linux is 0 for all userspace addresses.  I actually think it's the description for the PaX config option that's incorrect, since it claims that the pointers will "fall into kernel memory" which isn't the case.  A non-canonical address is simply considered invalid by the CPU; it's neither a userspace address nor a kernel address.<br>
<p>
The patch could maybe use a mention of the "OR" and "BTS" instrumentation methods and how only "BTS" is being proposed to be turned on upstream --- which I think is where some of your commentary comes from, though it isn't clear when you simply say things are "wrong", without saying how.  As far as I can tell, the important difference between the two methods isn't fully reflected in their names; the difference is actually that the "OR" instrumentation reserves register r12 in all kernel code to hold the value 1&lt;&lt;63 which can then be OR'ed with code pointers, while the "BTS" instrumentation does not reserve a register and therefore needs to load 1&lt;&lt;63 as an immediate and OR it with the pointer (as it does for calls; or rather, it uses a higher-level expression which gcc tends to compile as that) or use 'btsq' to set bit 63 of the pointer (as it does for returns).<br>
<p>
At first impression I think that it's kind of insane to reserve r12 everywhere just to hold a constant just for a (quite small, I expect) performance improvement.  I can see that in grsecurity/PaX it required a lot of hacks to change assembly code using r12 to use some other register instead, it also makes the kernel incompatible with binary-only modules.  It maybe makes more sense in the context of the grsecurity patch, but I don't think it would be a very maintainable solution for upstream.  Of course, at the risk of me getting flamed for saying this, if you and/or PaX Team have good arguments otherwise, I'd encourage you to clearly advocate for them on the mailing lists, which is where patches actually get proposed and reviewed.  Vague complaints on LWN are, from a technical perspective, simply not as effective at helping make Linux more secure.<br>

Well if it's pretty good as far as you can tell, there's no need for me to correct you then is there? ;) I'll then ignore your bogus performance claims (gee, who would know better about that one, an armchair expert or someone who wrote the code and ran the actual benchmarks?), UB, misunderstanding of the documentation (your addition of 'will' changes the intended meaning), not understanding how the 'OR' method works (it doesn't require reserving r12 'everywhere'), missing that the 'OR' method can be made trivially compatible with binary modules if the whole point of the method wasn't performance, etc, since clearly you know better than the person who wrote the plugin in the first place.<br>

For your final comment (and re: vague complaints): <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/706310/">https://lwn.net/Articles/706310/</a><br>

Finally, congrats on your first LWN comment after subscribing in March -- how much is the Linux Foundation paying you?  Clearly they should be paying more for someone who's written as many GCC plugins as you to maintain the ones KSPP currently is responsible for, and which KSPP members are completely inept at maintaining themselves ;)<br>

Hey Brad,<br>
<p>
Maybe you could spare all of us your endless vitriol?  Not all readers have the ability to do comment filtering.  Consider this particular 'tone argument' to be a request from one of the editors of the site to stop the attacks on people and ideas you disagree with.  Disagreeing is fine, do so politely and respectfully please.<br>
<p>
thanks!<br>

Hi Jake,<br>
<p>
That's fine, this will be my last comment on this site then, as you've made clear to me you'd prefer LWN to be a site for armchair experts to spread misinformation.  I can't help but feel though that you're making this personal attack because it was your article in question that was filled with factual errors.  Of course that makes me wonder: if the only method LWN employs in publishing "news" is to repeat misinformation and not bother to reach out to primary sources to ensure the accuracy of that information, and if the editor must surely know he's out of his depth in evaluating the correctness of that information, what purpose does its articles serve?  Clearly it's not to increase readers' knowledge, as it's providing them with false information.  So I really do wonder what purpose they're supposed to serve other than advertisement.  I hope one day you're able to achieve your goal of having no one on this site attack ideas they disagree with and that everyone can peacefully come together to agree on the same set of misinformation produced by whatever company happens to be funding your trips the most.<br>
<p>
Goodbye and good luck.<br>
<p>
-Brad<br>

      Oh please.
<p>
Nobody is asking you not to disagree.  Jake was quite clear on that.  You're just being asked to be a bit more adult about it.  If that makes you take your marbles and go home then so be it, but that was not actually the intent.

What a sad situation.<br>
<p>
That Brad mentions "free work" and money a few times, suggests the lack of funding is at least partially an issue here. That LF is paying people to take his (their? /me unsure of how many people PaXTeam are) work and port it to L-K strongly suggests there is value in that work.<br>
<p>
Someone should really find a way to make the source of these clearly valuable security patches happy (happier anyway), despite the clear chip on his/their shoulder (which LF paying others to port their work can only magnify - greatly).<br>

I don't think that's possible, the conflict is pretty fundamental, if rational discourse and compromise could have fixed it it would have done so by now.<br>

I'm not suggesting the existing bad feelings can be fixed. I'm suggesting the generation of _further_ bad feelings (and deepening problems) can be avoided.<br>
<p>
Seriously, people are paying _other_ people to work on Brad (et al?)'s work, but not him (them?). Fairly obvious this can only increase bad will.<br>

So, to summarise the situation:<br>
<p>
A does a great job doing something.<br>
A' does a similar job OK:ish, mostly based on the job of A.<br>
B needs that job done and offers money to have it done.<br>
A refuses to work for B.<br>
B still needs that work done, and contracts A' to do it instead.<br>
A complains that no one offers to pay him to do the job, and that A' is doing a shitty job.<br>

Well, it's not clear to me that "A refuses to work for B" happened after "B contracts A' to do it". It may be that A took their "A refuses to work for B" position _because_ B went and contracted someone else (A') to work on their work.<br>
<p>
Be interesting if someone knows for sure.<br>
<p>
It is still a sad and unproductive state of affairs. The work of A (don't want to write "A's work" given the notation you've chosen ;) ) clearly has a lot of value.<br>

What happens if you make a mistake, and zero a struct that's already been initialised?<br>
<p>
And doing extra unnecessary work ALWAYS has a cost. The kernel guys are hot on unnecessary work. (Not always in a sane way, I don't think, but the mindset of "machines are powerful, who cares about cost" is imho a very bad - and far too prevalent - one.)<br>

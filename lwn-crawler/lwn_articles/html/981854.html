</div>
<p>
Maintenance of the kernel is a difficult, often thankless, task; how it is
being handled, the role of maintainers, burnout, and so on are recurring
topics at kernel-related conferences.  At
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Josef Bacik and
Christian Brauner led a session to discuss possible changes to the way
filesystems are maintained, though Bacik took the lead role (and the podium).  There are a number of interrelated topics,
including merging new filesystems, removing old ones, making and testing changes
throughout the filesystem tree, and more.
</p>

<h4>New model?</h4>

<p>
The current model for filesystem maintenance—"that we all
know; we love it"—is that each filesystem has its own tree and pull
requests are sent to Linus Torvalds directly, Bacik began. If changes to
the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer are needed, those are sent to Brauner or
Al Viro depending on what part of the VFS they touch.  This works well for
established filesystems, but it can run into problems when there are
changes that cross filesystem boundaries, such as folios, the new mount
API, namespace things, etc.  That kind of work is happening more
frequently, and gets discussed at LSFMM+BPF, but many of the plans made do
not come to fruition, perhaps in part because "nobody feels empowered to
make those decisions and push that work through".
</p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982095/">

alt="[Josef Bacik]" title="Josef Bacik" width=218 height=280>
</a>

<p>
There is also "a little bit of vagueness about who owns what"; in
particular, merging new filesystems can go smoothly or can be a "painful
contentious thing" where the decision is left to Torvalds.  That is not
necessarily a bad thing, but it does create uncertainty for submitters of
new filesystems; it can also lead to the concerns of experienced developers
being waved away when Torvalds tires of the arguments and simply merges the
filesystem.
It is a strength of the Linux community that Torvalds can step in and just
merge things, but it means that new filesystem developers need to be persistent
and to try to sway Torvalds to ignore the other voices in order to get
their code merged, Bacik said.
</p>

<p>
For most of a year now, he has been proposing that the filesystem community
in Linux move toward a model like those of some other kernel subsystems, notably
networking and graphics.  In both cases, they have multiple, disparate
pieces that all funnel through the same maintainer and tree.  That can
clearly be 
seen in the <a href="/Articles/981742/">eye chart</a> that accompanies our
<a href="/Articles/981559/">6.10 development statistics article</a>. Bacik thinks
that changing in that way would help remove some of the pain points when making changes
across the filesystems.
</p>

<p>
When tree-wide changes are made, currently the developer needs to go figure
out where the right trees are for each filesystem, which can be painful.  In fact, he said, Btrfs
is probably one of the worst offenders in that regard, because its tree is
on GitHub; its policies and procedures are different from the others as
well.  Recently, Christoph Hellwig has been doing some work in Btrfs and
told Bacik that those differences are irritating enough that it makes him
want to avoid working on Btrfs. 
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Overall, Bacik feels that, because of those differences, the filesystem community is more difficult to
deal with than it should be, especially given how much code is shared
between the filesystems.  So he was proposing the creation of a single tree that all
of the filesystems push into; pull requests would no longer be sent to
Linus by the 
individual filesystem maintainers, but would come from the maintainer of
that tree.  That is mostly a mechanical change, but he would like to see
some cultural changes as well.
</p>

<p>
Viro noted that there are lots of filesystems in the kernel tree that do
not use VFS; they are specialized filesystems that live in the
<tt>security</tt> and <tt>arch</tt> trees, among other places.  He wondered if
Bacik really wanted to have filesystems for s390 and ppc (PowerPC), for
example, live in
this new tree.  Bacik said that those were not his focus; he is after the
filesystems that need changes like folio support, converting to the new mount API,
switching to iomap, and so on.
</p>

<p>
But Viro pointed out that the new mount API affects all filesystems,
including, say, the USB gadget filesystems.  Bacik said that was a good
point, which invalidated some of what he was suggesting.  But his goal is
to make it easier for people who are doing cross-filesystem work to "get
their patches merged without having to understand how each individual
filesystem community works". 
</p>

<p>
Viro suggested having a single topic branch that was shared for, say, folio
work.  That works for VFS topic branches, Bacik said, because all of the
filesystems are going to pay attention to those.  Every time there needs to
be a branch for non-VFS changes, though, it requires a negotiation of whose
tree that will all flow through, he said, which he would like to try to avoid.
</p>

<h4>An fs-next?</h4>

<p>
Dave Chinner gave a few-day-old example of this kind of problem.  Some changes
to iomap that caused an XFS regression had gone into Brauner's tree.
It was only discovered because of testing that was being done on
linux-next, which is where XFS and the iomap changes met.  Earlier, iomap
changes were flowing through the XFS tree, so this problem would have been
caught sooner.  Since the merge window was happening while the conference
was going on, that bug had probably already been merged into the mainline,
Chinner said.
</p>

<p>
So the changes that were recently made to try to "centralize some of the
infrastructure up into VFS trees is actually backfiring on us", Chinner said.  That is
because the next step of being able to share those changes down to the
individual filesystems for testing is not being done.  What he would like
to see is an fs-next tree that is a combination of all of the filesystem trees that
are planned for the next release; it would become the common test base that
everyone uses for regression testing, but would not be pushed as a whole
into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Someone in the audience asked why linux-next could not be used.  Chinner
said that it is not reliable enough for use as a test base.  Fs-next would
have better reliability, Chinner said in answer to the obvious followup,
because it would not have "device failures and all sorts of driver
problems".  Historically, linux-next has not been reliable enough to use
for regression testing or day-to-day development, he said.
</p>

<p>
Shifting gears a little, Brauner said that he does not think that
all of the filesystems need to flow through a single tree that gets passed
to Torvalds for merging.  That is infeasible, in his mind, both technically
and socially.  A lot of the people in the room probably enjoy the fact that they get
to send pull requests to Torvalds, he said.  A better solution would be to
have an fs-next tree.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said "linux-next is not terrible", but that, in practice, he waits
until -rc6 or -rc7 before he does a test merge of the ext4-development
branch into the mainline -rc tree for
integration testing.  The major problems that occur have generally been
worked out by -rc6 or -rc7; "somebody else has taken the arrows first".
Sometimes that falls by the wayside, though, for example when it those -rc
releases happen just
before a conference like LSFMM+BPF, which is a downside to waiting that
long for integration testing, he said.
</p>

<p>
No matter whether it is done using linux-next or fs-next, Ts'o said, the
important thing is for filesystem communities to be testing more than just
their own branch.  It is a big change, though, that needs to be
centralized in order to work, Brauner said.  He has his set of tests that
he runs on changes to the VFS infrastructure that he picks up, but "I have
zero idea what the XFS test matrix is and it is probably a <i>bit</i>
larger".  There is no centralized testing, so "we don't actually know if
what we are doing is not breaking anyone".
</p>

<p>
Chinner said that each filesystem is in its own silo, but that there is a
need to test the common code.  Neal Gompa said that each filesystem had its
own mechanisms for testing, reporting, coverage calculation, etc., but
there is no reason those all could not run on a system where people could
push code to give them a reasonable level of confidence that they did not
break things.
</p>

<h4>Common testing infrastructure</h4>

<p>
Matthew Wilcox thought that much of this problem could be solved by talking
to linux-next maintainer Stephen Rothwell.  It would probably not be
difficult for him to merge all of the filesystem trees into a separate
branch.  But even before a common branch gets created, there needs to be
common testing infrastructure, Kent Overstreet said.  It would only require
a couple of racks of hardware to set up; he has been hoping not to have to
do that himself, but may have to.  (As of June 14, he had <a
href="/ml/all/o55vku65ruvtvst7ch4jalpiq4f5lbn3glmrlh7bwif6xh6hla@eajwg43srxoj/">started
work</a> on a shared filesystem test cluster.)  When branches were pushed to
it, all of  
the tests for all of the different filesystems would run and the system
would provide a "simple dashboard" to report results.  The current
email-based system does not work, he said, since he cannot determine which tests
are being run.
</p>

<p>
Bacik said that he has an automated system for testing Btrfs; he could add,
say, tests for XFS, bcachefs, and others to that.  But there is a lot of
work that the Btrfs developers do to maintain the set of tests that
should be excluded (and the reasons why) from a run of <a
href="/Articles/897061/">fstests</a>.  That is done to ensure that the test
results are usable.  Someone would need to do that work for the other
filesystems. 
</p>

<p>
Chinner said that there is no need for Btrfs developers to test XFS or
other filesystems.  The important thing is for filesystem developers to
test their filesystem "with the same tree" to shake out integration
problems with the cross-filesystem work that is happening.  So, all of the
latest code for each filesystem would be in the same tree for testing by
the various communities using their own tests and infrastructure.  That
means that the tree
would be integrated, rather than trying to integrate all of the different
testing infrastructure that each filesystem has built up.
</p>

<p>
There is a need to be able to "go somewhere and click on something" to see
that a change "worked for everything that is relevant", Brauner said.  Gompa agreed with
Chinner that the existing infrastructure could be used,  but the testing
could be done against a single tree, such as fs-next, that filesystem
developers use as the basis for (and eventual destination of) their work.
The automated-testing systems that each filesystem uses would also be based
around the integration tree; perhaps a dashboard that collects the results
from each individual filesystem's infrastructure could be developed.  Eventually, moving
everyone to the same testing infrastructure, with a single integrated
dashboard and reporting mechanism, could be worked on.  The idea would be
to take "baby steps" 
toward a world where doing cross-filesystem development (or even just
following it, as he does) is "a hell of a lot easier". 
</p>

<p>
Instead of testing a for-next branch in, say, the XFS tree, the test target
should be the fs-next tree, Chinner said; nothing else changes in the
development workflow or in the actual tests that are run.  Ts'o said that
there may still be tests of various other branches as part of the
filesystem development, but that the fs-next tree would be tested daily,
say, by each of the filesystems.
</p>

<p>
David Howells asked if there could be a common base with the iomap changes,
folio-support changes, and the like for use by the filesystems.  Viro said
that could be created, but it would require agreement on exactly which trees are
included.  Howells wondered about how pull requests would be done, since
they cannot be based on fs-next. There would still need to be development
trees that are 
maintained so that pull requests can be made to Torvalds, Chinner said, but
that code will have been tested with the integration tree to head off
problems before they reach Torvalds.
</p>

<p>
There was some scattered conversation, largely not using the microphones, about
exactly which patches should go where, and when, to try to avoid problems
with bugs reaching the mainline that should have been caught earlier.
Brauner said that io_uring is often a place where changes that he makes
affect a completely different tree; he just creates a stable branch with
those changes that Jens Axboe pulls into his tree for testing.  Some of
that will still need to happen, but the problem
with the iomap changes that was mentioned by Chinner was an example of
where fs-next would have helped.
</p>

<p>
Bacik closed the session by noting that he would still like to figure out
how to make the lives of cross-filesystem developers easier so that they
did not have to try to figure out how to integrate with a bunch of
different filesystem-development communities.  But that would have to wait
since the session was out of time.

I'm hoping the common test infrastructure makes a different for people doing cross filesystem work; it should take a lot of the grunt work out of that.<br>
<p>
But for that to be useful we're all going to have to work on dealing with failing tests one way or the other, so that the results are useful to someone who isn't intimately familiar with a given fs.<br>
<p>
I need to do more work on the test dashboard too; since we test the whole history it shouldn't be hard to add a "failing since n commits ago" column.<br>

<p>
Rust, like C, has its own memory model describing how concurrent access to the
same data by multiple threads can behave.
The Linux kernel, however, has its own
ideas. The
<a href="/Articles/718628/">
Linux kernel memory model</a> (LKMM) is subtly different from both the
standard C memory model and Rust's model.
At Kangrejos, Boqun Feng gave a presentation about the
need to reconcile the memory models used by Rust and the kernel,
including a few potential avenues for doing so. While
no consensus was reached, it is an area of active discussion.
</p>

<p>
The problem, Feng explained, is that the LKMM makes guarantees that the Rust
memory model does not. Since the compiler doesn't know about those guarantees,
it can (potentially) make optimizations that break them.
The only saving grace is the ABI between C and Rust code, which should have
certain guarantees that both sides are aware of. However, in practice, many
architectures don't specify any guarantees about atomic operations or
interactions between threads as part of their ABI.
Having an ABI that listed the relevant guarantees
wouldn't be a complete solution in any case —
cross-language link-time-optimization (LTO) could still cause problems,
Feng said.
</p>

</a>

<p>
We need the memory models to admit the existence of each other, he stated. It
might seem as though pure-Rust code would not need to care about the LKMM, but
even that is not really true. The LKMM guarantees that if one thread stores to a
variable and then wakes another thread, the second thread will see that store.
Rust doesn't know that, and so the compiler could theoretically reorder the
store after the call to wake another thread. So any Rust code is impacted by the
things that the LKMM requires.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Hindborg asked whether there were really no situations where a kernel
driver written completely in Rust
could get away with not using the LKMM. Feng gave an example of how even a
simple multithreaded atomic counter ends up involving the LKMM. Paul McKenney
summed the problem up like this: there are plenty of existing boundaries where
someone might suggest making a distinction and saying that one memory model
applies on one side and one on the other side — function calls, for example —
but we don't do that. Ordering has to be a global property, McKenney said, or
things will get complicated for tool writers.
</p>

<p>
Benno Lossin questioned why Hindborg would want to use Rust's memory model
(specifically, the atomic operations that it makes available) for
isolated sections of code, if the Rust-for-Linux project is going to need
versions that match the LKMM anyway. Unlike any future attempt at producing a
LKMM-compatible atomics API for Rust, the existing Rust atomics are available
now, Hindborg said, and he doesn't want to be slowed down. McKenney suggested a
phased approach — target eventual exact compatibility, but for now,
strategically placed full barriers could be sufficient, even if they have higher
overhead.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Alice Ryhl suggested adding new types that are intended to eventually match the
semantics of the LKMM, implement them with Rust atomics internally, and then
later redesign them. Lossin disagreed, saying that the API design was the hard
part, and that it made more sense to use Rust atomics for now, and fix it once
the API did actually exist. Gary Guo suggested an entirely different approach:
checking that the compiled machine code respects the LKMM, regardless of what
the source languages are. If we can have LKMM atomics in Rust, we should just
use them, he said.
</p>

<p>
Feng's presentation came to the same conclusion: that the Rust-for-Linux project
should implement LKMM-compatible atomics and other related abstractions in Rust,
and use only those. To explain what that implies for the people who may be less
familiar with the LKMM, Feng highlighted a few specific differences.
For one thing, all atomic variables are automatically assumed to be volatile as
well — so the compiler cannot invent extraneous loads or redundant stores to them.
For another, there are different atomic
orderings available, including "<q>fully ordered</q>", which acts as a full
barrier for any other atomic operations. Failed compare-and-exchange operations
count as relaxed memory operations (as opposed to having two different versions,
one of which is always relaxed and one of which isn't).
Finally, the LKMM adds address, data, and control dependencies that
can influence ordering. Some of those are particularly subtle — an if statement
with a condition that reads an atomic variable only orders subsequent atomic
writes, not subsequent atomic reads, for example.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to assume that, since Rust code compiles to the same LLVM
intermediate representation as C
code, the compiler should be able to respect the rules of the
LKMM in the same way. Unfortunately, C compilers
actually already cause
problems for C code trying to follow the LKMM. Feng gave the example of code
trying to take advantage of the control dependencies he mentioned. Imagine an if
statement that reads from an atomic variable, and then writes to a different
variable in both branches of the if statement before going on to do two
different things. The compiler can and does
<a href="/Articles/860037/">
hoist the identical writes out of
the if statement</a> — something that would not cause a problem for ordinary code,
but that can change the order of atomic operations and potentially break the
guarantees that the programmer was relying on. In the kernel, this is the reason for
the
<tt>volatile_if()</tt> and <tt>ctrl_dep()</tt> macros, which generate
appropriate compiler barriers to prevent that from happening.
</p>

<p>
Guo asked whether the Rust
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hint/fn.black_box.html">
<tt>black_box()</tt></a> function could serve a similar
purpose, and Feng agreed that it could. McKenney was skeptical that it would
help with control dependencies in particular — and a quick test by Guo confirmed
that it does not. But there are other potential solutions based on Rust macros.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the solution will certainly involve paying more attention to how
atomics are used in Rust code. And while it is tempting to use simpler
implementations, this is the kernel — so there's no real way to avoid caring
about performance and architectural details, Feng concluded. There is some hope
for creating a generic API that the Rust-for-Linux project could implement,
however. Rust may soon have
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/130539">
generic atomics</a> in the form of an <tt>Atomic</tt> type that unifies all of
the existing atomic APIs. The kernel developers could theoretically implement
the same API, but based on LKMM atomics.
</p>

<p>
As the session was wrapping up, Ryhl said that she didn't care whether they end
up implementing any particular API — she just thinks that they should focus on
doing something simple first. The session came to a close before the attendees
could agree on what that might be, but, either way, the memory model consistency
concerns Feng wanted to address are definitely being actively considered.

      &gt; checking that the compiled machine code respects the LKMM, regardless of what the source languages are. If we can have LKMM atomics in Rust, we should just use them, he said. 
<p>
There only are a few important differences in the code generation between Linux and C11 atomics (the backend being the same for both C and Rust).
<p>
One is that relaxed atomics are different from READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE in terms of optimizability. In general more optimizations are possible on C atomics than what LKMM atomics will do, though in general this doesn't matter. Anyhow some examples can be found https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4455.html
<p>
Another is that C compilers do not implement the Consume memory ordering, and treat it as Acquire. This matters for optimizing RCU, but it's conservative so it's also respecting the LKMM.
<p>
The more important one boils down to the fact that seq_cst *fences* are different from seq_cst *atomics* in the C memory model. The latter only form a total order among themselves, while the former (just like the familiar smp_mb() in Linux) order all memory accesses. It escapes me why the committee used the same name for two very different things, but it can cause surprising effects especially on ARM.
<p>
On ARM the "acquire" and "release" operations are slightly different from the usual semantics. Release (e.g. STRL) is normal, but acquire (LDAR) will not just order before subsequent operations: it will also order after previous release stores. This was done so that seq_cst operations didn't need an expensive memory barrier and could just wait for previous seq_cst stores or read-modify-write operations. Unfortunately, this optimizes for a memory ordering that is <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst">just as harmful as volatile</a> and for very similar reasons, in that they hide the synchronizes-with relationship that the programmer wanted.
<p>
Anyhow, the result is that on Arm a cmpxchg in the C memory model does not have a trailing full seq_cst fence, which is there in the Linux kernel implementation of atomics. This has an effect if you need to implement something like
<pre>
     r1 = cmpxchg(&amp;a, 0, 1);
     // smp_mb() not needed here
     r2 = READ_ONCE(b);
</pre>
<p>
Another issue with the C and Rust memory models is the underspecification of the compiler (aka signal) fence. It is said to establish ordering between a thread and a signal handler executed on the same thread, by suppressing reordering of the instructions by the compiler. The standard however does not answer whether this also establishes ordering 1) with other threads executed on the same processor (e.g. via pinning or on a uniprocessor system) and 2) with other processors as long as a memory barrier instruction is executed (as is the case with Linux's <tt>membarrier</tt> system call).

BTW, Aarch64 compilers these days will use the LDAPR instruction (instead of LDAR) for a C11 load-acquire operation, if the target supports it. The only difference between the two instructions is that LDAPR does not have an ordering constraint with STRL.<br>
<p>
AFAIK this did not require any other changes (e.g. cmpxchg did not change, and still uses ldaxrb+stlxrb) -- it's just a simple relaxation. That is, by using LDAPR, the compiler has stopped requiring the hardware to enforce a constraint which the language's memory-model did not require it to enforce.<br>

One related thing (which was briefly discussed at the corresponding Plumbers talk) is that the Rust 'core' implementation of atomics doesn't have the same level of hardware/architecture support as the existing Linux/C ones. In particular, 'core' only supports 64-bit atomics on 64-bit systems, so code relying on, e.g., core::AtomicU64 won't build on some otherwise-supported architectures.<br>
<p>
Wrapping the C implementations will fix this, but if we allow Rust code to use non-LKMM atomics, or implement new atomics entirely in Rust, we'll need to either make sure to extend them to support these cases or add a bunch of Kconfig options so the dependency can actually be specified.<br>

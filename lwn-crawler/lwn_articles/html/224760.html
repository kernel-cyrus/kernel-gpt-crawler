<h1>Who's writing 2.6.21 and related issues</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 7, 2007 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Our article <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/222773/">Who wrote
2.6.20?</a>, which appeared two weeks ago, generated a strong response.
There is, it seems, a lot of interest in where this code is coming from,
but nobody had gotten around to doing the crunching to figure it out.  That
article calls for a followup in a few ways.
<p>

First, those who saw the article early on may want to take another look, as
some of the tables have been changed.  There was only one serious mistake
to fix - one developer's affiliation was incorrectly guessed by the code -
but further information has also helped to shrink the "unknown" column
somewhat.  The original tables can be found from the article (for whatever
historical reasons may exist), but the tables in the article itself are the
current ones.
<p>

The 2.6.21 cycle has moved far enough along as of this writing (the
2.6.21-rc3 prepatch is due any time) that it's worth taking a look
at the statistics for the just over 4,000 changesets which have been
merged.  There are some familiar names here, but some new ones as well.
The reflect the different nature of this development cycle, 2.6.21 will
have fewer changes in the virtualization area, for example, but it has some
significant core changes (like the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/223185/">clockevents and dynamic tick</a>
work).  A somewhat different set of developers had work ready to merge this
time around, and the results show that.
<p>
Anyway, the developers with the most work merged this time around are:

The list of developers contributing code to a given kernel release can
change over time, but the people through whom those patches pass - the
subsystem maintainers - remain about the same.  These developers form the
infrastructure which does the work of getting reviewed code into the
mainline kernel.

Many of the names are the same, but Red Hat does not dominate to quite the
same extent as in 2.6.20.  The percentage of patches contributed by
developers known to be working on their own time has increased slightly. 

<p>


Finally, some commenters on the original article requested the release of
the code used to generate the numbers.  Your editor has some qualms about
doing so.  The biggest among them is <i>not</i> that the code is an
embarrassing hack with, presumably, at least one bug still in it.  Neither
is it the fact that the code could be seen as a competitive tool for LWN;
frankly, there's nothing <i>that</i> complicated there.
<p>

The biggest worry is related to the attention these numbers drew, and the
fact that a couple of developers have mailed in to note that they have
received job offers as a result of appearing in the LWN lists.  In
addition, a few employers have contacted us to be sure that their
"account" is credited with the work of all of their employees.  The
numbers your editor has generated are approximations, but some people
clearly see them as being important.
<p>

The editors
at LWN have an interest in covering the free software community while
minimizing the changes that such coverage might cause - most of the time,
at least.  It seems plausible that, if the "top 20 contributors list" is
seen as a desirable place 
to appear - with positive career benefits - developers might change their
behavior as a result.  It would be a shame to start seeing kernel patches
aimed mainly at increasing a developer's count of lines changed.  Such
patches, one assumes, would not fare well in the review process, but it
would be better if the situation did not come up at all.
<p>

The issue of the mapping between developers and their employers is also
worth some consideration.  Some of that information was obtained directly
from the developers with a promise not to disclose it further; that promise
must be kept.  Beyond that, developers tend to change employers over time,
and the code is not currently smart enough to deal with that.  This
shortcoming is not a problem when looking at a single release cycle, but it
clearly would be an issue for multi-year analysis.  The code could be
improved, but it's not at all clear that the maintenance and distribution of a
database of kernel developers' work histories is something LWN wants to get
into. There are serious privacy issues to consider.
<p>

Despite these worries, the code is being released.  In the end, it's not as
if somebody else would have all that much trouble reproducing it.  Some of
the employer information has been taken out in response to the concerns outlined
above, though.  A tarball of the initial release can be found <a
href="/images/gitdm/">here</a>; 
your editor is looking forward to the flood of patches which will improve
the system.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Good point-data... the obvious next step is to run it on kernels farther back in history and build some graphs from the resulting dataset to show how, say, Redhat's kernel input has changed over time and etc.<br>

      If we consider the impact of the changes, all that metric is meaningless.  For me personally, 2.6.21 will be the first kernel to support Broadcom wireless card in my laptop reliable enough for day-to-day use with real life access points, without any patches and tricks.  Many thousands of users will be able to dump ndiswrapper and stop running Windows software in kernel mode on their laptops (and maybe on some desktops too).
<p>
Yet people who made it possible are not in any top-list.  That's probably because the Broadcom driver has been in the kernel for some time.  What's being done now is perhaps the hardest part, namely fixing the bugs that were preventing the driver from working.  Some bugs affect only specific revisions of the hardware, so the developers must rely on users' reports or actually buy that hardware.
<p>
Painstaking as it is, debugging the hard problems doesn't generate many commits, not does it change many lines of code.  Yet that's what makes the most difference.
<p>
Those two developers need to be mentioned in the comment since they are not in the article.  Many thanks to you, Larry Finger and Michael Buesch!

      Hear, hear!
<p>
That's not to say that the bcm-4311 in my Dell actually works right yet.  My latest experience is that the bcm43xx driver works only after bcm34xx-d80211 has been loaded and then unloaded.  Evidently the latter code knows more about how to turn the hardware on.  In particular, the indicator LED only operates after that driver has been loaded.  However, it's the bcm43xx driver that succeeds in communicating with the hub.

      Argh! Too late, you released the code...<br>
It would have been a good opportunity to raise developpers funding and most generally help them to find a new good job: list them in some "edited list with manual ponderation" generated by your tool (most generally on after a friendly request). You certainly need to take care to not associate such friendly "ranking" with too much free beer - we do not want to lose your too early.<br>
Hmm, maybe that would be cheating however... or some form of clever lobbying? Well, it's just statistics after all. By definition, they are worse than damn lies, so, someone will certainly abuse them, why not just ensure that they are abused the right way...;-).<br>
<p>
I am joking of course!<br>

      The employers who consider that appearing far up the affiliation list to be important seem to me to be missing the point. It's not the employers who do the work: it's the *people*.<br>
<p>
(This seems to be a mistake made by nontechnical managers really quite a lot, presumably because otherwise it would be plain that they weren't actually doing any productive work. ;} ;} )<br>

      Sure, the people do the work. But many of them could not (or would not) do that work if the employers weren't paying them to do so. Those employers are contributing significant value to the system, and deserve some kind of credit. (I realize that they have "selfish" reasons for contributing, but then that's true for most if not all individuals as well.)<br>
<p>
By appearing higher on the list, employers may be able to attract better talent, and make some extra sales, not to mention boosting their stock value a bit. I don't think they are missing the point at all.<br>

Well, managers and employers don't do anything useful, except paying
the bills...
</p>
<p>
...which for developers that don't like messing with business issues
(because only writing code is funny, and "productive"), can be a real
godsend!
</p>
<p>
In other words, the article contains two separate contribution tables:
by developer, and by employer.
<br/>
They are distinct for a good reason: they measure two different things.
<br/>
But none of them would exist without the other.
</p>
<p>
And this comes from a <i>developer</i>, who strongly feels that writing
code is the <i>real</i> thing, and managing layers are typically
mostly useless overhead.
<br/>
But, if I hadn't Novell paying my bills, I would hardly have the time
to contribute anything...

      well, we have releases, with release candidates between them, daily snapshots of Linus' git tree, and the raw git tree itself (updated frequently by Linus, but not on a fixed schedule)<br>
<p>
we have make targets of allyesconfig, allnoconfig, allmodconfig, randconfig (among others) to make the job of automating tests easier<br>
<p>
we have sets of systems that work to compile lots of sets of options from the release candidates (and if they have time, daily snapshots)<br>
<p>
what more do you think needs to be done?<br>
<p>
remember, the problem isn't that the change breaks things for everyone, it can break something for someone with some combination of compile options. the number of combinations to compile to cover every possibility is far too high to take place in the real world (how many years do you want to wait betwen when development stops and testing begins before a release is made?<br>
<p>
the thing that helps is people with different requirements testing at least the release candidates. while it doesn't garentee that there won't be any problems, the more combinations that get tested the more bugs get found early (and the earlier a group/originization runs tests with their requirements, the earlier any bugs that would affect them get found and fixed)<br>

      Hmmm... For serious longitudinal studies of the kernel, it might make sense to assign more anonymous monikers to the tracked individuals and entities.  Those monikers could be qualified by various details, but still left sufficiently vague that random people would find it hard to game the system.<br>
<p>
Obviously, certain individuals will always stand out regardless of what you might do in this analysis.  But, these same people stand out anyway.  So, you prevent the otherwise-would-be-unknowns from getting unfair "play," as it were, and avoid seriously perturbing the development process.<br>

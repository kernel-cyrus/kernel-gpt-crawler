<h1>The Big Kernel Semaphore?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted September 15, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Much of the latency reduction work spearheaded by Ingo Molnar is reaching a
state of completion; a lengthy set of patches has been posted which breaks
up long lock hold times and adds "voluntary preemption" points at strategic
places.  With these patches in place, most of the worst latency problems in
the 2.6 kernel have been addressed, even when kernel preemption is not
enabled.  That is good news for multimedia users and others who feel that
their needs have been passed over in the 2.5/2.6 development period.
<p>

One issue remains, however: there are some old parts of the kernel which
still rely on the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) for mutual exclusion.  Code which
uses the BKL is not performance critical itself (all such uses have been
fixed for a while).  But the BKL is a lock, and code which holds the BKL
will not be preempted.  That can mean long latencies if a code path holds
the BKL for a long time - and there are a few such paths.
<p>

Interest in eradicating use of the BKL has waned in the last year or two,
for a few reasons.  Any code whose performance was seriously impacted
by the BKL has been fixed.  And, perhaps more to the point, much of the
remaining code is ancient, crufty, and brittle.  Finally, as Alan Cox (who
holds the dubious fame of having created the BKL) <a
href="/Articles/102254/">points out</a>, the BKL is not a traditional lock:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The BKL turns on old style unix non-pre-emptive sematics between
	all code that is within lock_kernel sections, that is it. That also
	makes it hard to clean up because lock_kernel is delimiting code
	properties (its essentially almost a function attribute) and
	spin_lock/down/up and friends are real locks and lock data.
</div>
<p>
Fixing the remaining code is not an exercise for the timid.  In most cases,
the prudent course has been to simply leave things alone.  The latency
problem may just force this issue, however; by increasing latency,
BKL-protected code is harming the higher-performance parts of the kernel.
<p>

The BKL has one very interesting property which distinguishes it from an
ordinary spinlock: code holding the BKL can call <tt>schedule()</tt> at any
time.  When that happens, the kernel releases the lock until the scheduling
thread is returned to the processor.  If code holding the lock can
schedule, it ought to be preemptible as well - at least under some
circumstances.
<p>

Ingo Molnar has decided to mitigate the BKL problem by turning it into the
Big Kernel Semaphore.  As seen in <a href="/Articles/102216/">his
patch</a>, the BKS is a special sort of semaphore; it is recursive (as is
the BKL), and it is released when the thread holding it voluntarily
schedules.  The key difference from the BKL, however, is that a process
holding the BKS can be preempted - but the semaphore is not released in
that case.  So code which uses <tt>lock_kernel()</tt> is still protected
against other such code, just like it is now.  But that code can be
preempted (as long as it does not take any spinlocks).  That change should
be sufficient to address the latency problems caused by long BKL hold
times. 
<p>

Whether this patch will be accepted remains to be seen.  Linus <a
href="/Articles/102257/">doesn't like it</a>, but Ingo <a
href="/Articles/102258/">has reasonable responses</a> to his objections.
Including Ingo's patch would mitigate the current problems caused by the
BKL, which may have an undesirable effect: once again, there will be little
motivation to truly fix users of the BKL.  Some developers may prefer to
simply bite the bullet and eliminate those final BKL users for real.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Yes, I was the one who mentioned that the code still under the BKL was ancient and buggy.<br>
<p>
Moving on, since I've rewritten a fair amount of kernel/ and mm/ between 2.6.9-rc1 and 2.6.9-rc2 with the rewrites either in Linus' bk or in -mm now and LWN has yet to take notice, are you writing this stuff based on lkml archives from an account that has me procmailed to /dev/null or something?<br>

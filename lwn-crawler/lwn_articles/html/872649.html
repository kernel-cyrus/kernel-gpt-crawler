<p>
The <a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md">syzbot
kernel-fuzzing system</a> finds an enormous number of bugs, but, since many 
of them may seem to be of a relatively low severity, they have a lower priority
when contending for the attention of developers.  A talk
at the recent <a 
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-north-america/">Linux 
Security Summit North America</a> reported on some research that
dug further into the bugs that syzbot has
found; the results are rather worrisome.  Rather than a pile of
difficult- or impossible-to-exploit bugs, there are numerous, more serious
problems lurking within. 
</p>

<h4>SyzScope</h4>

<p>
The first speaker on day one of the summit was Xiaochen Zou, a PhD student at the
University of California, Riverside, who described
a tool that he and his colleagues have been running  on bugs that syzbot—which
uses the <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">syzkaller
coverage-guided fuzzer</a>—has
reported in the Linux kernel.  Over the last four years, syzbot has
reported around 4000 bugs, of which 3000 have been fixed.
There are eight categories that these
bugs mainly fall into, but only some of those categories represent security bugs, he said.
These are classic, severe kernel security holes, such as use after free, double
free, and out-of-bounds writes; they are mostly found by the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/dev-tools/kasan.html">Kernel
Address Sanitizer</a> (KASAN) as part of syzkaller runs.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/872881/">

alt="[Xiaochen Zou]" title="Xiaochen Zou" width=200 height=300>
</a>

<p>
There are several other classes of bugs that need fixing, but they tend to
get less attention; these include kernel or sanitizer assertions and
general protection faults (e.g. invalid pointer dereference).  In 
addition, bugs that allow memory to be read can provide information leaks,
such as kernel addresses, but those are generally not needed for exploits
to compromise the kernel, Zou said.  The researchers classified these as
low-risk bugs.
Bugs that are in lower-risk categories take longer to fix on average, and longer to backport
to various older kernels.  The sheer number of bugs that syzbot reports
overwhelms the ability of the kernel community to fix them everywhere they occur.
</p>

<p>
If the bugs that are slower to be fixed are truly of low risk, that's less
of a problem, but the research found that many of these bugs are not
actually low risk.
Beyond that, the syzbot reports do not always tell the
full story of the bugs' impacts.  Even worse still, there are ways to
automatically find higher-risk impacts from some of these low-risk bugs.
<a href="https://github.com/seclab-ucr/SyzScope">SyzScope</a> is a tool
that sets out to reveal high-risk impacts of bugs that are reported in a
low-risk category.  SyzScope is not meant to automatically create
full exploits because there are already other research projects that
are solving that part of the problem. In particular, <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/wu-wei">FUZE</a>
focuses on doing so for use-after-free vulnerabilities, and <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/chen-weiteng">KOOBE</a>
can be used for out-of-bounds-write vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<p>
There were several insights that the researchers had which led to the
development of SyzScope, Zou said.  Syzbot only shows the first problem it
finds in an execution path that it tests; it normally stops and reports the
bug. That makes sense, because syzbot is looking for bugs, not
necessarily security-related bugs.
But it may ignore further, more risky impacts downstream from
the bug it is reporting, which may downplay the risks of the bug, thus possibly delay
it from being fixed promptly.
</p>

<p>
Even if you allow fuzzing to continue, though, there are several types of
impacts that it will not be able to find, he said.  Control-flow hijacking and the
writing of values or addresses (either arbitrarily or constrained in some
way) are not detected by the sanitizers, kernel assertions, or other
mechanisms used by syzkaller.
</p>

<p>
He gave an example of an out-of-bounds read that KASAN detected and syzbot
reported; he showed that it could be turned into a write of null to an
arbitrary address.  But, because it relies on specific values in
out-of-bounds memory, fuzzing will not be able to find it; only if the
out-of-bounds memory is specially prepared will it be useful for this purpose.
</p>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">Heap
spraying</a> is a technique that an attacker could use to arrange memory in
that fashion.  Beyond just writing null, though, even further downstream
from the syzbot-related bug is
a function call made to an address that comes from the out-of-bounds
memory, which can be controlled by an attacker.  That leads to control-flow
hijacking and a full compromise of the kernel.
</p>

<p>
But those further impacts were found by human experts, not by syzkaller or
some other tool.  The researchers wanted a way to discover those types of
problems automatically.  Fuzzers cannot control the contents of the objects
that are
used after they are freed or the contents of out-of-bounds memory like an attacker can.
</p>

<h4>Symbolic execution</h4>

<p>
There is a technique that can do that kind of work, however: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution">symbolic execution</a>.
By using symbolic values rather than concrete values during program
analysis, symbolic execution can effectively simulate the results of heap spraying.
It can show what values need to be stored, and where to place them, to cause
the function to be called at a location of the attacker's choosing, for
example.
</p>

<p>
There are two modes of operation for SyzScope, both of which search
for high-risk bugs lurking behind low-risk reports.  In one mode, it uses
static analysis and symbolic execution on open bugs reported by syzbot.  In
the other, it looks at bugs that have been fixed,  using fuzzing, static
analysis, and symbolic execution.  The latter incorporates fuzzing to find
downstream effects of the original bug; it uses the bug-fix patch to
validate that new bugs found are consequences of the original.
</p>

<p>
In the interests of time, Zou said he would skip talking about the
static-analysis piece; it is optional and simply assists the
symbolic-execution step.
It is, in effect, an optimization.
</p>

<p>
A restricted form of fuzzing is used to try to find additional
buggy contexts that share the same root cause as the original bug;
those are then used by the symbolic-execution step to see if they are actually high-risk bugs.
Unlike syzbot, this fuzzing, which also uses syzkaller, does not stop when
it finds a bug. Instead, it continues to run
to see what else it can find. The fuzzer starts with the proof-of-concept code that
syzkaller produced to demonstrate the original problem and then uses a
"conservative mutating strategy" 
to try to find use-after-free bugs, out-of-bounds writes, and the like.  It
uses the bug-fix patch to determine which new contexts are related to the original
fixed bug; if those new contexts do not trigger a complaint from the
patched kernel, they correspond to high-risk bugs hiding underneath the
report that seemed to be of a low-risk bug type.
</p>

<p>
The fuzzer augments syzkaller's code-coverage feedback with impact
feedback.  It tries to find bugs that have a higher impact in order to find
high-risk bugs.  The code-coverage feedback sometimes leads the fuzzer into
finding entirely new bugs, which is not the focus of their efforts.
</p>

<p>
The symbolic-execution phase uses QEMU; it sets a breakpoint at the place
where KASAN reported a problem and triggers the bug.  It then launches
"angr", which is the symbolic-execution engine; angr finds the out-of-bounds
memory addresses from the KASAN report and "symbolizes" them.  The register
values in QEMU are 
transferred to angr, which can also retrieve memory contents dynamically from QEMU.
</p>

<p>
The engine looks for certain kinds of assembly language instructions, that
operate on values from the range of out-of-bounds memory reported by KASAN.  This
allows it to detect ways that various types of flaws can be exploited.  For
example, if the value passed to <tt>kfree()</tt> comes from within the
controllable memory, it is flagged as an invalid free; similarly, a call to
an address that comes from out-of-bounds memory is a way to produce a
control-flow-hijacking exploit.  Five different types of high-risk impacts
are detected in this way.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
The researchers ran an experiment using nearly 1200 lower-risk bugs that syzbot
reported. They ran each with three hours of fuzzing and four hours of
symbolic execution.  Overall, the experiment was able to find high-risk
impacts for&nbsp;147
low-risk bugs.  A lot of those low-risk bugs had
multiple other impacts, many of them from high-risk categories, associated with
them.  For example,&nbsp;51 
control-flow-hijacking impacts were found, both from fixed and open bugs
that syzbot had reported in lower-risk categories.  Around&nbsp;3200 separate
impacts beyond what syzbot reported were found.
</p>

<p>
Just the fuzzing discovered around half of the high-risk bugs, with
roughly&nbsp;5% of the total impacts found.
As noted earlier, fuzzing can only find impacts that do not require
control of the out-of-bounds memory contents.
For bugs that had already been fixed, thus
could use the fuzzing stage, there were an average of nearly&nbsp;28 further impacts
per kernel bug tested; an average of roughly&nbsp;17 additional impacts
were found from the open bugs tested. 
</p>

<p>
Symbolic execution detected the other half of the high-risk bugs found in the
experiment, including all&nbsp;34 that were found from bugs that were reported
by syzbot but still unfixed in the kernel.
It also found the vast majority (95%) of the impacts, including
all of super-high-risk impacts, like control flow hijacking and arbitrary
address writes.
</p>

<p>
The researchers submitted&nbsp;32 high-risk bugs to the CVE maintainers, eight
of which were assigned CVE numbers (which can be seen in slide&nbsp;28 of Zou's
<a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lssna2021/55/SyzScope%20in%20Linux%20Security%20Summit.pdf">slides</a>).
Their paper will be presented at the <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22">31st USENIX
Security Symposium</a> in August&nbsp;2022; it should be available soon,
Zou said.
</p>

<p>
The voluminous output from syzbot and the inability of kernel developers to
keep up with the onslaught has been a frequent cause for concern over the
years; these findings can only heighten those fears.  It would not 
be surprising to find out that black hats and governmental agencies are
using similar techniques to turn seemingly semi-innocuous bugs into ways to
fully compromise the kernel—in fact, it would be surprising if they were
<i>not</i>.  To a certain extent, these findings show that 
prioritizing bugs based on the impact reported by syzbot probably
frequently downplays the danger, but they do tend to validate the "all bugs are
security bugs" attitude that prevails within parts of the kernel-development community.

To help fuzzing, the kernel could let you set out-of-bounds memory.  It could oversize all allocations by 10% and then, subject to safety checks that the memory really is out of bounds, a system call lets you copy bytes into that extra space.  Or you could specify a buffer which will be copied (or partly copied) into the extra 10% of all allocations made from then onwards.  Or a buffer to be copied in when kernel memory is freed.<br>
<p>
Obviously you&#x27;d never enable any of these features or system calls in a production system, but when fuzzing they could help the fuzzer to set up exploits.  If it finds one that depends on setting out-of-bounds memory, then this is at least a &quot;theoretical security hole&quot; and could well be a real security hole, if an attacker more intelligent than a fuzzing program can find a way to set up the out-of-bounds memory without the helper system calls.<br>

I think those sanitizers set canary values and check them but I meant allowing user space to control what goes into the out-of-bounds memory.  Then the fuzzer can experiment with different data to trigger a crash.<br>

With this many bugs being found and fixed by a fuzzer, is actual progress being made? Are these kinds of bugs being fixed faster than they are being added?<br>
<p>
Ideally you&#x27;d like each patch, before merging, to be subjected to targeted fuzzing in the area being modified. If that can be made efficient enough, it could maybe detect issues *before* they are merged.<br>
<p>
But it&#x27;s amazing that fuzzing has gotten this advanced. Good stuff!<br>

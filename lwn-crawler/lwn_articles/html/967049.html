The Rust programming language differs from C in many ways; those
differences tend to be what users admire in the language.  But those
differences can also lead to an impedance mismatch when Rust code is
integrated into a C-dominated system, and it can be even worse in the
kernel, which is not a typical C program.  Memory models are a case in
point.  A programming language's view of memory is sufficiently fundamental
and arcane that many developers never have to learn much about it.  It is
hard to maintain that sort of blissful ignorance while working in the
kernel, though, so a recent discussion of how to choose a memory model for
kernel code in Rust is of interest.
<p>
<h4>Memory models</h4>
<p>
It is convenient to view a system's memory as a simple array of bytes that
can be accessed from any CPU.  The reality, though, is more complicated.
Memory accesses are slow, so a lot of effort goes into minimizing them;
modern systems are built with multiple levels of caching for that purpose.
Without that caching, performance would slow to a crawl, severely impacting
the production, delivery, and consumption of cat videos, phishing spam, and
cryptocurrency scams.  This prospect is seen as a bad thing.
<p>
Multi-level caching speeds computation, but it brings a problem of its own:
it is no longer true that every CPU in the system sees the same memory
contents.  If one CPU has modified some data in a local cache,
another CPU reading that data may not see the changes.  Operations
performed in a carefully arranged order may appear in a different order
elsewhere in the system.  As is the case in relativistic situations, the
ordering of events depends on who is observing them.  Needless to say, this
kind of uncertainty also has the potential to create disorder within an
operating-system kernel.
<p>
CPUs have special operations that can ensure that a given memory store is
simultaneously visible across the system.  These operations, though, are
slow and need to be used with care.  Modern CPUs provide a range of
"barrier" operations that can be used to properly sequence access to data
with less overhead; see <a href="/Articles/576486/">this article</a> for an
overview of some of them.  Use of these barriers can be somewhat complex
(and architecture-specific), so a few generic interfaces have been created
to simplify things (to the extent that they <i>can</i> be simplified).  A
memory model combines a specification of how barriers should be used and
any interfaces that ease that use, describing how to safely access data in
concurrent settings.
<p>

"The majority of the _good_ programmers I know run away screaming
from this stuff. As was said many, many years ago - understanding
<tt>memory-barriers.txt</tt> is an -extremely high bar- to set as a basic
requirement for being a kernel developer."<br>
— <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200716014656.GJ2005@dread.disaster.area/">Dave
Chinner</a>, 2020
</div>

The C11 standard, for example, defines some <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/atomic">atomic types</a> and
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic">atomic operations</a>.
C++ offers <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic">an
atomic type</a> of its own.  While the kernel community has occasionally <a
href="/Articles/691128/">discussed</a> using the C atomic types, that has
never happened for a number of reasons, some of which will become apparent
below.  Instead, the kernel defines its own memory model, described in the
infamous <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/wrappers/memory-barriers.html">memory-barriers.txt</a>
file (and sometimes referred to as "LKMM").  Few kernel developers
understand this model in detail (and many <a href="/Articles/827180/">find
it too subtle</a> to understand deeply), but it governs how memory
access works at the lowest levels.  (See also <a
href="/Articles/718628/">this article series</a> for more on the kernel's
memory model).

<p>
One of the early concerns about incorporating Rust into the kernel is that
the Rust language lacked a memory model of its own.  That gap has since
been filled; the <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/#memory-model-for-atomic-accesses">Rust
memory model</a> looks a lot like the C++ model.  Boqun Feng, who helps
maintain the kernel's memory model, thought that it would be good to
formalize a model for Rust code to use in the kernel.  Should the Rust
model be used, the kernel's model, or some combination of the two?  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240322233838.868874-1-boqun.feng@gmail.com/">posted
his conclusion</a> to the linux-kernel mailing list: Rust code should
adhere to the kernel's memory model.  He included an initial patch set
showing what that would look like.
<p>
<h4>Using the kernel's model</h4>
<p>
The reasoning behind this conclusion is simple enough: "<q>Because kernel
developers are more familiar with LKMM and when Rust code interacts with C
code, it has to use the model that C code uses</q>".  Learning one memory
model is hard enough; requiring developers to learn two models to work with
the kernel would not lead to good results.  Even worse results are likely
when Rust and C code interact, each depending on its respective memory model
to ensure proper data ordering.  So, as long as the kernel has its own
memory model, that is what Rust code will have to use.
<p>
Kent Overstreet <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/s2jeqq22n5ef5jknaps37mfdjvuqrns4w7i22qp2r7r4bzjqs2@my3eyxoa3pl3/">pointed
out</a> a disadvantage of this approach: the kernel will remain
incompatible with other Rust code and will not be able to incorporate it
easily.  He suggested that, perhaps, the kernel's memory model could be
rebuilt on top of C or C++ atomic operations, at which point supporting the
Rust model would be easier.  That seems unlikely to happen, though, given
the strong opposition from Linus Torvalds to any such change.
<p>
One of Torvalds's arguments was that <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whY5A=S=bLwCFL=043DoR0TTgSDUmfPDx2rXhkk3KANPQ@mail.gmail.com/">language-based
memory models are insufficiently reliable</a> for use in the kernel, and
that is not a problem that can be addressed quickly.
"<q>The C++ memory model may be reliable in another decade. And then a
decade after *that*, we can drop support for the pre-reliable
compilers.</q>" Thus, he said, "<q>I do not understand why people think
that we wouldn't want to roll our own</q>".  Feng <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Zf4fDJNBeRN5HOYo@boqun-archlinux/">added</a> that
the kernel's memory model encompasses a number of use cases, such as
mixed-size operations on the same variable, that are important to the
kernel.  Those uses are not addressed (or allowed) in the Rust model.
He did suggest that, perhaps, a subset of the Rust model could be
implemented on top of the kernel's operations.
<p>
Another reason for the kernel project to implement its own memory model,
Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whkQk=zq5XiMcaU3xj4v69+jyoP-y6Sywhq-TvxSSvfEA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>,
is that kernel developers need to be deeply familiar with the architectures
they are supporting anyway.  There is no way to create a kernel without a
lot of architecture-specific code.  Given that, "<q>having the architecture
also define things like atomics is just a pretty small (and relatively
straightforward) detail</q>".
<p>
Torvalds has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjP1i014DGPKTsAC6TpByC3xeNHDjVA4E4gsnzUgJBYBQ@mail.gmail.com/">another
reason</a> for sticking with the kernel's memory model, though: he thinks
that the C++ model is fundamentally misdesigned.  A key aspect of that
model is that data exposed to concurrent access is given a special atomic
type, and the compiler automatically inserts the right barriers when that
data is accessed.  Such a model can ensure that a developer never forgets
to use the proper atomic operations, which is an appealing feature.  That
is, however, not how the kernel's model works.
<p>
In the kernel's memory model, it is not the type of the data that
determines how it must be accessed, but the context in which that access
happens.  A simple example is data that is protected by a lock; while the
lock is held, that data is not truly shared since the lock holder has
exclusive access.  So there is no need for expensive atomic operations;
instead, a simple barrier when the lock is released is sufficient.  In
other settings, where a lock is not held, atomic operations may be needed
to access the same data.
<p>
Torvalds argued that the kernel's approach to shared data makes more sense:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In fact, I personally will argue that it is fundamentally wrong to
	think that the underlying data has to be volatile. A variable may
	be entirely stable in some cases (ie locks held), but not in
	others.
<p>
	So it's not the *variable* (aka "object") that is 'volatile', it's
	the *context* that makes a particular access volatile.
<p>
	That explains why the kernel has basically zero actual volatile
	objects, and 99% of all volatile accesses are done through accessor
	functions that use a cast to mark a particular access volatile.
</blockquote>
<p>
This approach has been taken in the kernel for a long time; it is described
in the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/volatile-considered-harmful.html">volatile-considered-harmful
document</a> that was first <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0faa45480261">added to the kernel</a>
for the 2.6.22 release in 2007.
<p>
The outcome of this discussion is clear enough: Rust code in the kernel
will have to use the kernel's memory model for the foreseeable future.  The
Rust language brings with it a number of new ways of doing things, many of
which have significant advantages over&nbsp;C.  But bringing a new language
into a code base that is old, large, and subject to special requirements is
always going to require some compromises on the new-language side.  Using
the kernel's memory model may not actually be a compromise, but it is
different from what other Rust code will do; it will be one of the many
things Rust developers will have to learn to work in the kernel project.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Vehemently agreeing for variables (esp. arrays) marked as "atomic." Ok, you use atomic int-fetch-and-add (ifa) to build them, but then they're effectively constant.<br>
<p>
Consider transposing a sparse matrix in CSR/CSC (compressed sparse row/column) representation. With ifa, you can build the transpose in parallel using only the output space. But if the language requires you to copy it... And doesn't allow some method of *scoping* the "atomicity" as with function arguments that suddenly don't match, well, feh.<br>

Another disadvantage of going with a custom memory model is not immediately being able to use a bunch of nice tools like loom (<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom">https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom</a>) which allow you to exhaustively test your code with the worst orderings the C11 memory model allows, which is very neat.<br>
<p>
That said, the Kernel is probably big enough of a project for someone to be willing to add support for the LKMM to tools like this.<br>

Doing anything like that would require the lkmm to be well-specified and correctly-implemented enough to be correctly formally modeled.<br>
<p>
Given how many research papers and iteratations the C/C++ mm has taken to address all sorts of crazy edge cases, and how little of that sort of work seems to have been done on the lkmm so far (as far as I can tell, at least), I'm skeptical that formal modeling could be successful yet...<br>
<p>
But maybe I'm wrong. I mean, I'm not an expert, I can only even barely understand the implications of the issue with sequentially-consistent ordering raised in <a href="http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf">http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf</a> and subsequently fixed in the first part of <a href="https://wg21.link/P0668">https://wg21.link/P0668</a> for C++20...<br>

Rust is just a tiny minority compared to the kernel's C code.  It ought to be obvious that it's better to convert the tiny minority than the huge majority.<br>
<p>
If yet another language is brought into kernel space (Java, C++, Algol) with yet another memory model, do you switch both Rust and kernel code to use the new tiny minority language?<br>

It's easier to keep the working memory model and make tiny newcomers adjust to it.<br>

You are wrong. It may be EASIER, true, but if the working model is flawed then it's technical debt. In which case, yes maybe evolve it rather than ditch it, but it's SAFER (and better in the long run) to make the working model adjust to the newcomers.<br>
<p>
They found a lot of long-standing bugs in LLVM because Rust used a different model ...<br>

The standard practice in the Linux kernel world seems to be that if you break something, you fix it - i.e. if you change an interface, you have to submit a patch that not only does what you're intending to do, but fixes that interface everywhere it's used, in all zillion lines of the kernel. <br>
<p>
In theory the Rust folks could submit a patch that included changes across the entire kernel to update it to use a new memory model. That's 25 million lines of code, across multiple architectures including some they may not have access to. Some fraction of which are being actively developed while they're doing that work, so they'll have to go back and update those, etc etc. I expect the heat death of the universe to occur before they finished...<br>

      <p>Which C memory model?
<p>The whole problem here is that the kernel (written in C) has a memory model based on C90's memory model with extensions, and this memory model is not compatible with C11's memory model.
<p>In turn, the C11 memory model is underspecified (contains defects, to use the C committee jargon), and you need to consider the fixes to it in C17 and C23 to have a complete memory model - it's also quite likely that a future C standard will fix more defects in the C11 memory model.

Thanks for writing about this, but I do wish this article had given some examples of Rust code that is legal in normal userspace Rust but not in the Linux kernel, so people not deeply steeped in these models could understand what it really means.<br>
<p>
From a brief look at the patches you linked, it seems like the impact is that Rust kernel code won't be able to use the normal `std::sync` primitives, like for atomic ints, but rather some different kernel-specific primitives. However, most Rust code would look the same as you'd normally expect, except for using these different underlying types?<br>

That's probably the case, but given the context (drivers and filesystems and other kernel components) the usage of synchronized access (locking), atomics, etc. will likely be orders of magnitude more frequent than 'normal Rust code'. If the replacement primitives don't provide the same semantics as the ones in the Rust standard library, then the code is fundamentally different even if it appears to be similar.<br>

That reduces my (already low) plans of working on the kernel. I can see the arguments against how C uses volatile, but the memory model is already confusing enough, and trying to use volatile in ways it's not intended just adds confusion. Why not copy from a volatile variable, work on it, and then copy it back to the volatile variable when you're done? Similar semantics, and clearly working within the standard.<br>

Because it doesn't give you the option to do a non-volatile access. Which is the common case in the kernel. We want optimization, except for in a few cases (a.k.a. context).<br>

So "you" want the _same_ memory to behave sometimes as "shared" and sometimes not. This is definitely looks like very  sharpest knives.<br>
<p>
Even _C++_ chose a "slower" and safer to use model? Wow, no surprise everyone is running away from memory-barriers.txt.<br>
<p>
I guess it's OK as long as the kernel can provide "some" safe abstractions/routines that allow most kernel developers not to think about that? Which seems to be the case since very few understand memory-barriers.txt and Linux has been relatively... successful :-)<br>

Note that C++20 did add support for atomic access to memory without using an atomic typed variable, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic_ref">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic_ref</a><br>
<p>
But also, gcc and clang have supported it as a compiler built-in function since forever. The kernel has never been shy about using compiler extensions elsewhere, so I'm not sure why the inability to do atomic access on non-atomic-typed memory in standard C is even a point of discussion.<br>
<p>
Such functionality is certainly useful for some rare cases, but does mean the user has to _manually_ deal with ensuring the alignment is as high as required, and ensure that the memory isn't accessed non-atomically at the same time as atomically (or else UB).<br>
<p>
It's good for the functionality to exist, but it's also good for it not to be the default, because atomics already have enough sharp edges without. I'd note also that in most cases, it is entirely sufficient to drop down to a memory_order_relaxed access, instead of dropping to a non-atomic access. The cost of a relaxed atomic access is minimal, as are the guarantees (more sharp edges!).<br>

You would need to provide context either way because `volatile` only tells the compiler not to remove or reorder across sequence points (calls to functions and other `volatile` accesses), but does nothing wrt the CPU that will reorder whatever it wants, nor across non-volatile accesses. You need the explicit barriers for any kind of synchronization, there's no way around that. So, just use the `WRITE_ONCE` and `READ_ONCE` macros that will do the `volatile` access while ensuring the right behavior wrt the CPU as well. And it the context allows, simply read and write from the normal variable without penalty.<br>

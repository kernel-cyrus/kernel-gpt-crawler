<h1>Better per-CPU variables</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 12, 2007</br>
           </div>
One of the great advantages of multiprocessor computers is the fact that
main memory is available to all processors on the system.  This ability to
share data gives programmers a great deal of flexibility.  One of the first
things those programmers learn (or should learn), however, is that actually
sharing data between processors is to be avoided whenever possible.  The
sharing of data - especially data which changes - causes all kinds of bad
cache behavior and greatly reduced performance.  The recently-concluded <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/">What every programmer should know
about memory</a> series covers these problems in great detail.
<p>

Over the years, kernel developers have made increasing use of per-CPU data
in an effort to minimize memory contention and its associated performance
penalties.  As a simple example, consider the disk operation statistics
maintained by the block layer.  Incrementing a global counter for every
disk operation would cause the associated cache line to bounce continually
between processors; disk operations are frequent enough that the
performance cost would be measurable.  So each CPU maintains its own set of
counters locally; it never has to contend with any other CPU to increment
one of those counters.  When a total count is needed, all of the per-CPU
counters are added up.  Given that the counters are queried far more rarely
than they are modified, storing them in per-CPU form yields a significant
performance improvement.
<p>

In current kernels, most of these per-CPU variables are managed with an
array of pointers.  So, for example, the <tt>kmem_cache</tt> structure (as
implemented by the SLUB allocator) contains this field:
<p>
<pre>
    struct kmem_cache_cpu *cpu_slab[NR_CPUS];
</pre>

<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/percpu-array.png" width=242 height=212
alt="[percpu array]" hspace = 3 align="right">


Note that the array is dimensioned to hold one pointer for every possible
CPU in the system.  Most deployed computers have fewer than the maximum
number of processors, though, so there is, in general, no point in
allocating <tt>NR_CPUS</tt> objects for that array.  Instead, only the
entries in the array which correspond to existing processors are populated;
for each of those processors, the requisite object is allocated using
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> and stored into the array.  The end result is an array
that looks something like the diagram on the right.  In this case, per-CPU
objects have been allocated for four processors, with the remaining entries
in the array being unallocated.
<p>
A quick look at the diagram immediately shows one potential problem with
this scheme: each of these per-CPU arrays is likely to have some wasted
space at the end.  <tt>NR_CPUS</tt> is a configuration-time constant; most
general-purpose kernels (e.g. those shipped by distributors) tend to have
<tt>NR_CPUS</tt> set high enough to work on most or all systems which might
reasonably be encountered.  In short, <tt>NR_CPUS</tt> is likely to be quite a bit
larger than the number of processors actually present, with the result that
there will be a significant amount of wasted space at the end of each
per-CPU array.
<p>
In fact, Christoph Lameter noticed that are more problems than that; in
response, he has posted <a href="/Articles/258248/">a patch
series for a new per-CPU allocator</a>.  The deficiencies addressed by
Christoph's patch (beyond the wasted
space in each per-CPU array) include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> If one of these per-CPU arrays is embedded within a larger data
     structure, it may separate the other variables in that structure,
     causing them to occupy more cache lines than they otherwise would.
<p>
<li> Each CPU uses exactly one pointer from that array (most of the time);
     that pointer will reside in the processor's data cache while it is
     being used.  Cache lines hold quite a bit more than one pointer,
     though; in this case, the rest of the cache line is almost certain to
     hold the pointers for the other CPUs.  Thus, scarce cache space is
     being wasted on completely useless data.
<p>
<li> Accessing the object requires two pointer lookups - one to get the
     object pointer from the array, and one to get to the object itself.
</ul>
<p>

Christoph's solution is quite simple in concept: turn all of those little
per-CPU arrays into one big per-CPU array.  With this scheme, each
processor is allocated a dedicated range of memory at system initialization
time.  These ranges are all contiguous in the kernel's virtual address

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/percpu-noarray.png" width=242 height=204
alt="[New percpu structure]" hspace=3 align="right" border=0 vspace=3>

space, so, given a pointer to the per-CPU area for CPU&nbsp;0, the area for
any other processor is just a pointer addition away.
<p>
When a per-CPU object is allocated, each CPU gets a copy obtained from its
own per-CPU area.  Crucially, the offset into each CPU's area is the same,
so the address of any CPU's object is trivially calculated from the address
of the first object.  So the array of pointers can go away, replaced by a
single pointer to the object in the area reserved for CPU&nbsp;0.  The
resulting organization looks (with the application of sufficient
imagination) something like the diagram to the right.  For a given object,
there is only a single pointer; all of the other versions of that object
are found by applying a 
constant offset to that pointer.
<p>

The interface for the new allocator is relatively straightforward.  A new
per-CPU variable is created with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/cpu_alloc.h&gt;

    void *per_cpu_var = CPU_ALLOC(type, gfp_flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will allocate a set of per-CPU variables of the given
<tt>type</tt>, using the usual <tt>gfp_flags</tt> to control how the
allocation is performed.  A pointer to a specific CPU's version of the
variable can be had with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *CPU_PTR(per_cpu_var, unsigned int cpu);
    void *THIS_CPU(per_cpu_var);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>THIS_CPU()</tt> form, as might be expected, returns a pointer to
the version of the variable allocated for the current CPU.  There is a
<tt>CPU_FREE()</tt> macro for returning a per-CPU object to the system.
Christoph's patch converts all users of the existing per-CPU interface and
ends by removing that API altogether.
<p>
There are a number of advantages to this approach.  There's one less
pointer operation for each access to a per-CPU variable.  The same pointer
is used on all processors, resulting in smaller data structures and better
cache line utilization.  Per-CPU variables for a given processor are
grouped together in memory, which, again, should lead to better cache use.
All of the memory wasted in the old pointer arrays has been reclaimed.
Christoph also claims that this mechanism, by making it easier to keep
track of per-CPU memory, makes the support of CPU hotplugging easier.
<p>

The amount of discussion inspired by this patch set has been relatively
low.  There were complaints about the UPPER CASE NAMES used by the macros.
The biggest complaint, though, has to do with the way the static
per-CPU areas bloat the kernel's data space.  On some architectures it
makes the kernel too large to boot, and it's a real cost on all
architectures.  Just how this issue will be resolved is not yet clear.
If a solution can be found, the new per-CPU code has a good chance of
getting into the mainline when the 2.6.25 merge window opens.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hah!
1) It's simply stupid to write software that assumes this as it won't scale to distributed
systems.
2) If we didn't have shared mutable memory, vast classes of bugs, typically concurrency
related, wouldn't exist.
3) The direction in which CPU architectures are moving makes it less and less likely that a
single unified address space and general shared mutable memory are a) likely and b) desirable.

Hence the endless rise of languages like Erlang and Haskell which aren't built, unlike, say C,
on an unachievable model of a computer.

That's like saying one of the great advantages of a lamp is that it illuminates things.  It's not just a great advantage, it's the definition.
What would make a system in which the various processors have separate memory a multiprocessor system?

<p>
It sounds like you're saying it's stupid to write software for multiprocessor systems because then it would be software for multiprocessor systems.
<p>
I'm actually a foe of multiprocessor systems.  My experience makes me believe processors separated by TCP/IP, FCP, etc. links are more profitable for most things.  But I can definitely see the advantages of SMP.

<p>
Everything <b>ms</b> says, and everything the article says, is applicable to to all multiprocessor systems, NUMA and non-NUMA alike.  They all have shared memory and they all have difficulty because of that.
<p>NUMA shares memory in a way that strikes a different balance between the difficulties and the advantages of shared memory than other multiprocessor systems, but it remains a defining characteristic, not just an incidental feature, of multiprocessor systems that they have shared memory.

<a href="/Articles/604609/">Control groups</a>
</div>
<p>The original justification for this series was so that we all could
understand Linux control groups enough that we might be able to enjoy
the occasional debates that crop up around them.  It is now time to
see how that worked — to see how well you, or I, can assess some
proposal or challenge in the context of all the issues that appear to
surround control groups.  In this, the final installment of the
series, we have two opportunities to test our new skills.</p>

<p>An obvious first target is the "unified hierarchy" that is available
as a developer preview in Linux 3.16, which was <a href="/Articles/601840/">covered recently</a>
on these pages.  If you haven't done so already, now might be a good
time to go back and re-read the article to see whether (and how) various
issues we have found are being addressed.  If you want to be thorough,
read the <a href="/Articles/601923/">unified-hierarchy.txt</a> documentation too.</p>

<p>It might help to start by writing down a list of the issues that
seemed important to you.  It can also help to list some design
patterns, or anti-patterns, to be on the lookout for.  Four that I find
helpful were identified in a previous series on the "Ghosts of Unix
Past": <a href="/Articles/411845/">full exploitation</a>, <a href="/Articles/412131/">conflated designs</a>, <a href="/Articles/414618/">unfixable designs</a>,
and <a href="/Articles/416494/">high maintenance designs</a>, all of which are summarized at the end
of that last article.</p>

<h4>The unified hierarchy: A score card</h4>

<p>Having identified your key issues and arrived at your conclusions, you
will no doubt want to either have them affirmed, or have an
opportunity to defend them.  To meet this need, I present some of my
own conclusions.</p>

<p><em> Unification of hierarchy </em></p>

<p>It is nearly indisputable that the number of hierarchies allowed by
   classic cgroups is excessive.  It is less clear that reducing the number
   to one is ideal.  In our investigations we found very different uses of
   hierarchy: some subsystems imposed control downward, others collected
   accounting upward.  These are very different uses involving different
   implementation concerns.  It is arguable that they justify distinct
   hierarchies.

   <p>The unified hierarchy is clearly working toward the removal of excessive
   duplication, which is good.  It doesn't seem to acknowledge that different
   subsystems might genuinely have incompatible needs, but then it hasn't
   completely closed the door to separate hierarchies yet.  So this aspect
   deserves a <b>B</b> — good work, but room for improvement.

<p><em> Processes only permitted in the leaves </em></p>

<p>The unified hierarchy requires that processes only exist in the leaves
of the tree.  The enforcement approach for this is somewhat clumsy.
Leaves are "any node that doesn't extend any subsystem to children"
and there is a two-step dance when creating a new level in the
hierarchy. Processes must be moved down first, then subsystems can
be extended down afterward.</p>

<p>This complexity achieves an end result that is already possible
anyway (system administrators and tools could easily choose to keep processes in
leaves) and, thus, is largely uninteresting.  It's not clear that the
kernel needs to enforce a sane policy of processes-only-in-leaves any
more than it should enforce the sane policy that the filesystem root
be read-only to most users.</p>

<p>I was going to give this issue a <strong>C</strong> (too complex), but there is a
wart on the design that should be highlighted.  Processes are excluded
from internal cgroups <em>except</em> for the root cgroup, apparently because
the root needs "special treatment".  This exception actually leads to
a score of <strong>C+</strong> for reasons which will become apparent later.</p>

<p><em> Taming the chaotic subsystems </em></p>

<p>We have seen that the correlation between cgroup subsystems and
elements of functionality is rather chaotic.  This is not a new
observation: at the <a href="/Articles/464288/">2011 Kernel Summit</a>, Paul Turner was reported as
saying that:</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
Google would, based on its experience, rip apart a lot of the
controllers and rework them in a better form.
</div>

<p>While that sort of rewrite may be too much, it would be nice if we
could de-emphasize the current division into subsystems in the hope
that more meaningful groupings could emerge, possibly between the
control of processes and the control of other resources.  The unified
hierarchy seems well-placed to advance this need, but unfortunately
goes in the opposite direction.  Lists of subsystems now appear
throughout the cgroups filesystem in the <code>cgroup.controllers</code> and
<code>cgroup.subtree_control</code> files.  It is true that attribute files are
already named after their subsystem, but having a
<code>freezer.state</code> file makes
sense whether "freezer" is a separate subsystem or just an element of
functionality.</p>

<p>Explicitly listing enabled subsystems in <code>cgroup.controllers</code>
effectively entrenches the current structure, so this issue gets a
<strong>D</strong> from me.</p>

<p><em> Providing a resource-consumer ID </em></p>

<p>We saw in part five that pages in memory can identify who gets the
refund when the memory is freed, but not who gets charged for IO when
the content is written out.  By insisting that all subsystems use a
single hierarchy, a single cgroup can serve as a resource consumer ID
for all resources types.  This is clearly a solution to the problem,
but it is hard to tell if it is a good solution (different resources
may be very different) so I'm reserving judgment for now and only
giving a <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<p><em> Processes or threads </em></p>

<p>Classic cgroups allows individual threads within a process to be in
different cgroups.  Imagining a credible use case for this is
difficult, but not quite impossible.</p>

<p>The <code>cpuset</code> controller can restrict processes to a set of CPUs and,
separately, to a set of memory nodes in a NUMA system.  The former
restriction can be imposed on any thread using the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html"><code>sched_setaffinity()</code></a> system call or the
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/taskset.1.html"><code>taskset</code></a>
program, without involving cgroups.  But the set
of memory nodes can only be configured through cgroups.
Imposing different memory nodes on different threads (which share
one address space) doesn't make much sense, so that doesn't justify
cgroups per thread, but there are other values that
  can only be set through cgroups.</p>

<p>The Linux scheduler allows the priority of a thread to be set with
much finer granularity than the traditional 40 point "nice" scale.
It allows each thread or group to have a "weight" which ranges up to
about 100,000
(<code>weight = 1024 * 0.8<sup>nice</sup></code>, <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/sched/sched.h?v=3.15#L1053">approximately</a>).
This weight can only be set using cgroups.  If you want that fine
control of individual threads, you need threads in cgroups.</p>

<p>These are both examples of what I would call the "procfs problem".
The procfs filesystem became a way for various <em>ad hoc</em>
functionality to be added to 
the kernel with minimal design review, because there were no clear
design guidelines.  Consequently, it handles much more than processes.
Similarly, cgroups seems to allow "back door" access for functionality
that is not at all specific to the control of groups of processes.    If the only use for threads-in-cgroups is to benefit from these back
    doors, then disallowing them might encourage better API design.
</p>

<p>The unified hierarchy does exactly this and only allows processes (also
    known as thread groups) to be in different cgroups.   This seems like a good
    idea but does raise a question: what exactly should we try to control?  Threads?
    Processes?  Something else?  Whatever the answer, dropping support for moving 
    individual threads seems like a good idea, so this gets an <b>A</b>.

<p><em> Code simplicity </em></p>

<p>The unified hierarchy is only one step in what could be a long
process.  There have been a lot of improvements in the code leading up
to the current state, but the full value of the changes won't be fully
realized until some old functionality can be removed.  When that might
be is unknown.</p>

<p>What we do know is that only processes (not threads) will ultimately
need to be in cgroups and they will only need to be in a single cgroup
each.  This will certainly bring simplicity, so an <strong>A</strong> is clearly in
order.</p>

<p><em> Summary </em></p>

<p>The less-than-stellar scores assigned above probably have several
causes, not least my own personal bias.  The most significant single
cause is almost certainly the foundation on which the unified
hierarchy is being built.  Like many first implementations, cgroups
really isn't very good:  The role of hierarchy and the purpose of subsystems
   are at best confused. If a <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/You+can%27t+make+a+silk+purse+out+of+a+sow%27s+ear">sow's ear</a> is all you have, a silk
purse is really too much to ask for.</p>

<p>One of the premises of the unified hierarchy is that we have to stay
with control groups in some form.  Tejun Heo would have <a href="/Articles/484254/">preferred</a> a
different structure layered "<q>over the process tree like sessions
or program groups</q>", but mourned "<q>that ship sailed long
ago</q>".  A little 
over a year earlier, something happened which has implications that
might not be so melancholy.</p>

<h4>Auto-group Scheduling</h4>

<p>As was <a href="/Articles/418884/">reported</a> in
late 2010, there are ways other than cgroups to
control groups of processes.  Using the group scheduling support that
was developed for cgroups, Mike Galbraith created a different,
automatic mechanism to group processes together for scheduling.</p>

<p>The standard Unix scheduler, and most successors, attempts to be fair
to processes, but processes aren't necessarily the best focus for
fairness.  On the AUSAM Unix variant I used as a student (Australian Unix
Share Accounting Method, which evolved into <a
href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5wo_X_zaUQ8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA53&dq=related:Fb9V2fwLM5KO_M:scholar.google.com/&ots=PIL1aWVzmt&sig=YDFrEVuvFrPvKSPuU3rHnGN-w1w">SHARE II</a>), fairness was
aimed at users first, so that one student running six processes (the
local limit at the time) would not get more CPU time than another
student running only one.  On a modern developer's desktop, the "job"
(in the job-control sense — a process group) is a very logical
grouping.  Different jobs (browser, game, <tt>make&nbsp;-j&nbsp;40</tt>) could
reasonably compete against each other on an equal footing, and
processes or threads within a job should reasonably compete against
each other, but not, as individuals, against other threads.</p>

<p>There are two issues with automatic scheduling using process groups
that were raised in the <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1050575/">mailing list thread</a> that records the history of
auto-group scheduling.  The issues were raised by very different people
and received very different responses.</p>

<p>The first, raised by Linus Torvalds, is a suggestion that process
groups are too fine-grained for this purpose.  Creating a new
scheduling group does have some cost, so doing it too often could
introduce unacceptable slowness.  Unfortunately there is no record of
anyone measuring the cost (despite some encouragement from Linus) and
only a vague assessment of what constituted "too often" — somewhere
between <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1050575/focus=1065031">"one for every command invocation in the shell"</a> and
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1050575/focus=1065102">"tens of thousands of times a second"</a>.</p>

<p>This claim was never really challenged.  The final implementation used
"sessions" rather then "process groups", which certainly do get created
less often.  However, this doesn't really seem like the right
grouping. If you run: 
<pre>
    make -j 40 &gt;&amp; log &amp;
</pre>
to compile your project,
and then <tt>frozen-bubble</tt> to pass the time — both from the same terminal
window — your game will compete with 40 processes instead of with one
job.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to test the overhead that a
<tt>fork()</tt>+<tt>exec()</tt> suffers if a 
scheduler group is also created: <code>/bin/env&nbsp;/bin/echo&nbsp;hello</code> and
<code>/bin/setsid&nbsp;/bin/echo&nbsp;hello</code> will do exactly the same
things except 
the latter creates a new session and hence a new scheduler group (if
both are run from a shell script, not from an interactive shell):
<pre>
    time bash -c 'for i in {1..10000}; do /usr/bin/setsid /bin/echo hi ; done &gt; /dev/null'
    time bash -c 'for i in {1..10000}; do /usr/bin/env /bin/echo hi ; done &gt; /dev/null'
</pre>
 The
difference between those two is certainly in the noise.</p>

<p>The second issue was <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1050575/focus=1063356">raised</a> by Lennart Poettering: "<q>On the desktop
this is completely irrelevant.</q>"  At the time this claim was made, it
was true to a substantial extent, because auto-grouping was being done
based on "controlling tty" and most desktop applications would
equally have no controlling tty.  A video editor and a browser would
be in the same scheduling group, so the multiple rendering threads used
by one could swamp the single thread used by the other.  By the end of
the discussion, it was again true to a different extent.  Auto-grouping
was now done based on "sessions", and most desktop session managers did
not put each application into a different session.  One session manager
that was under development did: systemd already used <code>setsid()</code> as
required.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Lennart's comments were <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1050575/focus=1063363">not well received</a>, he
was at that time working on software that could easily bring the
benefits of auto-group scheduling to a larger group of users.  No one
seemed to realize that.</p>

<p>But, back to the main story, the key lesson from auto-group scheduling
is that the cgroups effort inspired some useful functionality in the
scheduler, and this functionality can be used quite separately from
cgroups.  When a process is in a non-root cgroup (from the perspective
of the <code>cpu</code> subsystem), it is scheduled as directed by cgroups.  When
it is in the root, it is scheduled according to auto-groups (unless
auto-groups has been disabled).  This is why it is a positive that the
unified hierarchy allows processes to remain in the root of the
hierarchy even when the root is no longer a leaf.  It means that the
way is left open for independent resource management to be developed
in parallel to cgroups, and for both cgroups and non-cgroups
management to happen on the same system.  This leads to the second
challenge.</p>

<p>We have something that the original cgroups developers didn't start
with: years of experience and working code.  This is a wealth that we
should be able to turn to our advantage.  So, to test your new-found
understanding of resource management, the challenge is this: inspired
by auto-groups for scheduling, how would you implement resource
management and process control in Linux alongside, but independently
of, cgroups?  Once you've thought that through, you can come back and
compare your results to mine.  Don't worry, we'll still be here when
you're done.</p>

<h4>Hindsight groups: highlighting some issues through contrast.</h4>

<p>Contrast is a powerful tool for helping us see things more clearly.
So to present the issues that I found to be important, I've embedded
them in a different context.  Hindsight groups, a name which
reflects their origin, are sometimes different to make a point, and
sometimes different just to be different.  Hindsight groups are
focused: they are only about restricting groups of processes.  Any
need that doesn't match that description needs to seek a home
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In hindsight groups (or "hgroups"), the base unit of control is the
process group, as created by interactive shells, by systemd, and,
potentially, by any other session manager.  Control can still be
imposed on individual processes using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prlimit.2.html"><code>prlimit()</code></a> or
similar commands, but controlling groups has no finer granularity than
the process group.</p>

<p>To provide a management structure for these process groups, a new level
in the PID hierarchy is added.  A "process domain" is introduced above
sessions and process groups.  Processes are initially in domain zero.
A process that is in domain zero and is alone in its session and its
process group can call <code>set_domainid()</code> to start a new domain that
is subordinate to domain zero, thus creating a two-level hierarchy of
domains.  When a new <a href="/Articles/531419/">PID namespace</a> is created, the domain containing
the starting process appears as domain zero in the new namespace and
new domains in that namespace are subordinate to the local domain
zero, thus establishing a multi-level hierarchy.</p>

<p>The hierarchy formed by domains strongly constrains processes.
Once inside a domain, a process cannot get out of that domain.  Each
domain is associated with a process group — the process group of the
process that created it.  All other process groups in the same domain
are considered to be subordinate to that first process group.  This
effectively places all process groups into a hierarchy.  It is very
much an organizational hierarchy, rather than a classification
hierarchy.  It provides structural groupings like "login session" or
"container" or "job".  It collects processes based on the task they
perform more than the way they behave.</p>

<p>With this new, more strongly defined role for process groups comes a
new data structure that is allocated per-process-group, much like a
<code>signal_struct</code> is allocated per-process.  It contains a set of
restrictions that apply to processes in the group.  Some of these,
like an access control list of devices (similar to that provided by
the <code>devices</code> cgroup subsystem), are referred to whenever the process
needs to check if something is permitted and cgroups is not configured
or provides only the "root" cgroup.  Others, like a set of CPUs that
may be used, need to be pushed out to all processes and threads in the
process group whenever they change.  This is uniformly done by sending
a virtual signal to all processes (similar to the approach taken by
the <code>freezer</code> cgroup subsystem).  During handling of that virtual
signal, a process will update its local understanding based on
restrictions in the process group.</p>

<p>The per-process-group restrictions can be changed by any process that
has an appropriate user ID or has superuser permissions.  However, a process
can only give extra permissions (i.e. reduce restrictions) that its
own process group has, and that every process group above it in the
hierarchy has.  Changes are <em>not</em> propagated down by the kernel, but a
user-space tool can propagate the lifting or imposing of restrictions
reliably.</p>

<p>One important restriction identifies certain actions that processes
cannot perform, and causes them to block if they try.  
  One setting of this restriction effectively freezes all processes in the
  group, much like the cgroups <tt>freezer</tt>.  Another setting only freezes a
  process when it tries to create a new process group.  This makes it
  possible to impose some restriction on all process groups in a domain in a
  race-free way.
</p>

<p>The various shared resources: memory, CPU, network, and block I/O, each
have specific needs and are managed separately.  They benefit from
these groupings and this hierarchy, but they are not tied to it.</p>

<p>Networking and block I/O have some similarities, as they generally
involve capping or sharing data throughput.  They are also quite
easily virtualized, so that a sub-domain can be given access to a
virtual device that routes data to and from a real device.  They can
have multiple separate devices to manage and have other concerns
beyond just the process that is involved.  The network system needs to
manage its own link-control traffic and possibly traffic forwarded
from another interface.  The block-I/O subsystem already makes an
internal distinction between metadata (using the <code>REQ_META</code> flag) and
other data, and so needs to classify requests in different ways.</p>

<p>Consequently, these two systems have their own queuing management
structures and are not known to hgroups.  The various queuing
algorithms may classify requests based on the originating domain, or
they may support some labeling of individual processes (similar to
the cgroups network classes subsystem), but that is beyond the interest of
hgroups.</p> 

<p>Memory usage management is quite different from the other shared
resources because it is measured in space more than in time.  With the
other three (network, block I/O, CPU) a process can start or stop using
the resource at any moment or can be temporarily barred from the
resource with no ill effects.  With memory, the resource is useless
unless it is constantly available for some non-trivial period of time.</p>

<p>This means, as we saw in an earlier installment, that memory must be
charged to some entity that persists for quite a while.  It also means
that it is difficult to impose proportional sharing.  The cgroups
memory controller imposes two limits: a hard limit that must not be
exceeded and a soft limit that is only imposed when memory is very
tight.  Varying the soft limit doesn't really affect the proportion of
sharing, but instead affects the proportion of pain imposed when
memory must be freed.</p>

<p>
These twin needs of persistence and imposing restrictions is met perfectly
by process domains, and they serve much the same role as cgroups do in the
hierarchy used by the <tt>mem</tt> subsystem.  The memory resources used in each
process group are charged to the containing domain, and to that
domain's containing domain if there is one.  If any limit is reached
the allocation fails and memory reclaim is instigated.  There are hard
and soft limits just as with cgroups.</p>

<p>It is possible for a privileged process to redirect the
memory accounting for any process group in a subordinate domain so that
 usage within that process group is charged to some other domain
instead.  This can be used, for example, to cause all domains
belonging to a given user to have a single overall memory limit
imposed, even though the primary hgroups structure doesn't recognize
users.  In any case, a PID number (currently 24 bit) is sufficient to
identify a memory resource owner.  This would allow two or even three
identifiers for different resources to be attached to a request or a
page of memory to charge subsequent handling properly.</p>

<p>CPU throughput limits are imposed in nearly the same way as memory
allocation limits.  The only difference is that the limits can be
imposed on the local process group as well as just the domain.
Limits can be both raised and lowered by a suitably privileged
process.</p>

<p>CPU scheduling is probably the most complex of the resource managers.
Scheduling groups are formed roughly following the
domain/process-group/process hierarchy, but with grouping optional at
each level.  If grouping is enabled for domain 0, then the processes
in each domain are grouped and those groups are scheduled against each
other.  If it isn't enabled, then the individual process groups in
each domain are all scheduled against each other, creating a result
quite similar to the current auto-groups.  As with memory resources, a
privileged process can direct a process group to be scheduled in the
context of some other process group.</p>

<p>On a single-user system, it is likely that domain scheduling would be
disabled, and the top-level scheduling would be between process
groups.  In a multi-user system, the extra cost of domain-level
scheduling would probably be justified.  Inside containers, the same
choices can be made, independently in each container.</p>

<p>This enabling of CPU scheduling independently at each level is a
little bit like the approach the unified hierarchy takes of
optionally enabling different subsystems at different levels.  It is
more general, though, as the set of enabled levels does not need to be
contiguous.</p>

<p>Hgroups CPU scheduling has another important difference from both
cgroups and auto-groups.  One of the problems with auto-groups
scheduling is that it changes the effect of using <code>nice</code> to make a
program run at a lower priority.  The fact that <code>nice</code> doesn't really
work anymore <a
href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=149553">has</a> been <a
href="http://serverfault.com/questions/405092/nice-level-not-working-on-linux">reported</a>
but not yet fixed.  It seems that 
some regressions are less important than others, though possibly it
hasn't been reported on the right forum.</p>

<p>The problem is that each scheduling group has a priority that is
independent of the processes in the group.  When you set the
<code>nice</code>ness of some process, it only causes it to be nice to
processes in the same group (same session for auto-groups).  When a
user has multiple sessions (which is the whole point of auto-groups)
they cannot easily be nice to each other.</p>

<p>Hgroups is not in the business of setting priorities, only of imposing
restrictions.  The restriction it imposes on a process group is to set
an upper bound for the priority weight of that group.  The effective
weight of a group is then the sum (or possibly the maximum) of the
weights of active members, providing that does not exceed the upper
bound.  This allows a low-priority process to continue to be genuinely
nice to all other users, not just those in the same scheduling
group.  When there are no low-priority processes, it works much the
same as the present scheme.</p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>

<p>I have certainly found this adventure to be very educational and I'm
thankful that you could join me on it.  It has achieved the goal of a
deep understanding, but I cannot yet tell if it will achieve the goal
of improving entertainment.  When the next chapter in the cgroups
story is revealed, I am prepare to be excited or dismayed; thrilled or
disgusted; challenged or affirmed.  But the one thing I don't expect
to be is bored.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Well, I certainly arrived at a similar conclusion regarding grouping based on session management primitives, but your articles also were quite skillfully crafted to lead me there. :)<br>
<p>
What I'm missing a bit is the discussion of how the in-kernel data structures might / should evolve from here. To me it seems pretty obvious that, once the unified hierarchy can be assumed at compile time (possibly with a CONFIG_CGROUP_UNIFIED_ONLY flag), the process' (task group leader's) data structure would gain a<br>
  struct cgroup       *cgrp;<br>
element, and the horribly-to-traverse struct cgrp_cset_link hopefully a thing of the past. Or, if your caveat on separate hierarchies for accounting (upward) and control (downward) proves important enough, two<br>
  struct cgroup *cgrp_acc;<br>
  struct cgroup *cgrp_ctl;<br>
elements. In any case, getting than horrid NxM data structure out of possibly hot paths can only be a good thing.<br>
<p>
I also expect more controllers to move their accounting or control data into struct cgroup itself. I agree that the cgroup.controllers / cgroup.subtree_control interface is suboptimal (I would have preferred them to be the same file at least). I'm not quite sure how this "entrenches the current structure" though, and what you would have done differently here.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Evolving our cgroups in the direction of your hypothetical hgroups could then start by the kernel automatically creating a new cgroup instance on setsid() and setpgid() (or possibly moving the process to a different cgroup in the case of the latter). Later a struct cgroup could even be embedded in the session/pgroup data structures, while still taking care that processes could be moved between cgroups. I'm not sure if in such a world you'd still create the set_domainid() system call, or the "upper layers" of the cgroups tree would just be handled by systemd using traditional cgroup knobs.<br>
<p>
You briefly touch on the cost of scheduling in such a multi-level world. Constraining the scheduler to one fixed level of the hierarchy is certainly one way to approach this; but it might be efficient enough if the scheduler would just work on two levels: non-leaf groups (the most specific group that still has scheduling enabled) and leaves (processes / threads). The usual caveats about carefully considering cache-line bouncing apply.<br>

<p>
The omission of "should" was deliberate.  "should" is a question of large scale project engineering which I don't feel qualified to comment on - quite different from analysing code and code history, and finding and describing patterns which I do feel qualified for.<br>
<p>
"might" I thought I was quite clear on: copy autogroups.  Leave cgroups alone and create something that provides the same functionality using a better model and is active only on processes in 'root' cgroups.<br>
<p>
If it were up to me (which it isn't) I would freeze development of the cgroups filesystem interface as of 3.15 and start adding all the important functionality to Linux in more idiomatic ways.  Once the functionality was available in a "sane" way, I would encourage major users to migrate to the new (presumably better) API and eventually deprecate cgroups. <br>

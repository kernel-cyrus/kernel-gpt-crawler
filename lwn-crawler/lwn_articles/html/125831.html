<h1>Toward the merging of Xen</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 2, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen virtual
machine</a> has been getting a great deal of attention.  Xen allows virtual
systems to be run, over Linux, with high performance.  Each machine can run
a different operating system (perhaps even Windows, eventually), can have
its resource usage limited, and can even be moved between physical hosts
while it is running.  Xen is of interest to people doing kernel
development, or who are interested in providing virtual hosting services. 

<p>
Xen works by creating its own virtual hardware architecture, to which guest
kernels are ported.  The separate architecture is required to enable Xen to
truly isolate guest systems in such a way that they cannot break out.  This
approach also allows Xen to perform various performance-enhancing tricks,
such as allowing Xen systems to communicate by transparently remapping
pages between them.  For Linux, the Xen patches create a completely new
architecture (<tt>arch/xen</tt>) which, while resembling the i386
architecture (and copying many files from it), is separate from it.

<p>
For some time now, certain kernel developers have been saying that the
merging of Xen was imminent.  Nobody seems to object to having support for
Xen in the mainline kernel, but there is one little glitch: back in
December, Andi Kleen <a href="/Articles/125846/">objected</a> to the
creation of a separate Xen architecture.  The creation of a completely new
architecture which duplicates much of the i386 code will, says Andi, lead
to long-term maintenance problems.  He would much rather see Xen support
merged into an i386 subarchitecture.

<p>
Xen developer Ian Pratt initially <a href="/Articles/125847/">responded</a>
that such a merge was not feasible, and, besides, maintaining the separate
architecture had not been a problem for them so far.  Andi remained
convinced, however, that things would not work well in the long term.  The
discussion slowed to a halt without any real decisions being made, one way
or another.
<p>

Andrew Morton recently decided to <a href="/Articles/125849/">restart the
conversation</a> with an opinion of his own:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I tend to agree with Andi, and I'm not sure that the Xen team fully
	appreciate the downside of having an own-architecture in the
	kernel.org kernel and the upside of having their code integrated
	with the most-maintained architecture.  It could be that the
	potential problems haven't been sufficiently well communicated.
</div>
<p>

Ian Pratt came back with <a href="/Articles/125851/">a new proposal</a>.
The Xen group would start by doing the easy parts of merging the Xen code
directly into the i386 architecture.  Most of this work, he says, would
involve cleaning up the i386 code; the result would be a halving of the
number of files modified by the Xen patches.  The remaining changes would
then go in as an i386 subarchitecture except for any Xen code which is
useful for all architectures; that, instead, would end up in
<tt>drivers/xen/core</tt>.  Further unification and cleanup could happen
after the merge takes place.
<p>

This approach appears to have satisfied the critics, the obligatory minor
quibbles notwithstanding.  So that is probably the path Xen will take to
get into the mainline.  There is, it would seem, a fair amount of work to
be done before that mainline merge can actually happen, though, so it's not
at all clear that it can be done in time for 2.6.12.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      They are working on a port to x86_64.  Additionally, not mentioned above, there are OS ports of plan9, netbsd, and freebsd.<br>

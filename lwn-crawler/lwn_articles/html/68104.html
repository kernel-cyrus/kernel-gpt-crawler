<h1>FUSE - implementing filesystems in user space</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 27, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/66289/">Last week</a> we looked at
implementing device drivers in user space.  Drivers are not the only kernel
functionality which can be moved across the divide, however; it is also
possible to implement filesystems with user-space code.  Linux has a long
tradition of user-space filesystems, actually; NFS was implemented that way
for quite some time.  Even so, user-space filesystems are not widely used,
for a number of obvious reasons (performance, security, ...).  But there
are situations where a user-space filesystem can be a nice thing to have.
<p>
For those situations, there is a project called FUSE.  Its associated <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf">SourceForge page</a> is not
particularly enlightening; one really has to look at the project's code to
understand what FUSE has to offer.
Since the second FUSE&nbsp;1.1 release candidate has just been <a
href="/Articles/68048/">announced</a>, this seems like a good time for such
an examination.
<p>
FUSE is a three-part system.  The first of those parts is a kernel module
which hooks into the VFS code and looks like a filesystem module.  It also
implements a special-purpose device which can be opened by a user-space
process.  It then spends its time accepting filesystem requests,
translating them into its own protocol, and sending them out via the device
interface.  Responses to requests come back from user space via the FUSE
device, and are translated back into the form expected by the kernel.
<p>
In user space, FUSE implements a library which manages communications with
the kernel module.  It accepts filesystem requests from the FUSE device and
translates them into a set of function calls which look similar (but not
identical) to the kernel's VFS interface.  These functions have names like
<tt>open()</tt>, <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>rename()</tt>,
<tt>symlink()</tt>, etc.
<p>
Finally, there is a user-supplied component which actually implements the
filesystem of interest.  It fills a <tt>fuse_operations</tt> structure with
pointers to its functions which implement the required operations in
whatever way makes sense.  This interface is not well documented, but <a
href="/Articles/68106/">the example filesystem</a> provided with FUSE
(which implements a simple sort of loopback filesystem) is reasonably easy
to follow.
<p>

An old filesystem module (AVFS) uses FUSE to make filesystems out of tar
and zip files, but one could imagine any number of other possibilities.  It
would not be that hard to make filesystems which mirror a web site (in
read-only mode, at least), provide access to an object database, or provide
a file-per-user view of the password file, for example.  FUSE could be an
ideal platform for experimenters who want to take the "everything is a
file" idea to its limit.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It certainly does seem like Linux is becoming more and more microkernel-like every day.  One wonders what Linus says about this.

      One of the cool features of userland isolation is that it's much easier to watch behaviour and resource consumption.  Curious about how much memory or CPU your protocol stack is consuming?  Easy...<p>--Stuart

      I think it's a good idea to support microkernel-like behavior, so that <br>users can trade off performance for isolation. I'd certainly prefer that <br>drivers be in userspace when performance isn't an issue; if my PDA sync <br>takes twice as many context switches, I probably won't even notice the <br>difference, but I will be glad if it doesn't take the system down if it <br>is buggy. On the other hand, I don't think that Linux will get <br>particularly micro; just because you can have filesystems and drivers in <br>userspace doesn't mean that having your root filesystem or video drivers <br>in userspace is going to be a good idea. <br> <br>

      Actually, there is a project to implement the KIO protocol using FUSE.  <br>This would enable GTK/GNOME applications to use the KIO slaves, for <br>example. <br> <br>I don't know the link offhand, but I think http://dot.kde.org/ has news <br>about it.

There's also <a href="http://lufs.sourceforge.net/lufs/">LUFS</a>
(which incidentally supports gnome-vfs modules like fuse supports
kioslaves - can't have one doing both, it seems ;).
I'd really like to see <em>one</em> of these make it to the default kernel...
</p>

<p>
Anyway, anyone know if the fuse kernel interface is secure nowadays,
in a sense that one can safely allow users to freely use even their own
filesystem code to mount things? I asked basically the same on the lufs list
a good while back, and there were, in effect, no answers, and the
lufs daemons seem to run as root which is a kind of telltale sign
that one doesn't want arbitrary user code there...

      Security is one of the main design principles of FUSE.  The only operation that requires root access is the mounting, and that can be done fairly securely by a non-root user with the help of a suid program (fusermount).

      That has always been my recollection, as well.  NFS server in user space, using Linux-specific calls like setfsuid(2), client in the kernel.

      SieFS is an example of a filesystem implemented with FUSE. SieFS can mount the filesystems of recent Siemens mobile phones (such as the S55) on Linux. Site: http://mirror01.iptelecom.net.ua/~dmitry_z/siefs/

      OK, so making homepages is not my strong point :).  This is not the first time somebody complains, and it's now being worked on by a brave volunteer (SF job recruitment is cool).<p>Anyway here's a link to a list of filesystems (that I know of) that are using FUSE:<p>http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/fuse/Filesystems<br>

      Has anyone ever written a 9P (aka 9fs) client for Linux?  I know there are a couple of servers but I can't see anything obvious on Google.<p>a kernel-space 9P client would let you implement almost anything you like in terms of filesystems as userspace servers.<br>

      Ron Minnich had a good go at it, but I don't think it was really<br>completed - pitty, because as you say, it would &quot;let you implement<br>almost anything you like...&quot;<p>Some stuff is on his homepage at:<br>  http://public.lanl.gov/rminnich/<br>and there is an inactive sourceforge site at:<br>  http://v9fs.sourceforge.net/<p>There was also work on private namespaces for Linux and BSD, which is<br>the other key technology to getting this all to work properly!

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 20, 2016</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, Linus has pulled 8,415 non-merge changesets into the
mainline repository for the 4.5 development cycle; 5,300 of those have come
in since <a href="/Articles/671470/">last week's summary</a>.  Recent
merge-window 
history (12,092 patches for 4.2, 10,756 for 4.3, 11,528 for 4.4) suggests
that we 
probably have some merging to go still; a quick look at linux-next suggests
that there is still a fair amount of unmerged work in the ARM tree in
particular.  It is probably fair to say, though, that the bulk of the
significant features that we will see in 4.5 are in place now.
<p>
The most significant of those features include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> There is a new restriction on access to memory via <tt>/dev/mem</tt>:
     it can no longer access ranges of memory that have been claimed by a
     device driver.  The specific purpose is to protect non-volatile memory
     arrays, which, due to their size, are relatively easy to hit by
     accident, but there are other advantages as well.  Someday, perhaps,
     <tt>/dev/mem</tt> will go away entirely, but there are still a few
     things that use it now.  Note that the first 1MB of memory is
     unaffected by this restriction; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/90a545e981267e917b9d698ce07affd69787db87">the
     commit changelog</a> for some more information.
<p>
<li> The kernel's persistent-memory support has, until now, lacked the
     ability to properly support direct I/O and DMA to persistent memory.
     <a href="/Articles/672457/">That has changed</a> in 4.5 with the
     merging of proper support for <tt>page</tt> structures backing up
     persistent-memory arrays.
<p>
<li> The libnvdimm (non-volatile memory) layer has gained a bad-block
     management layer borrowed from the MD RAID code.
<p>
<li> The XFS filesystem now performs checksum validation of all log entries
     before applying them during recovery.  That should greatly reduce the
     chance of applying corrupted data.
<p>
<li> There is now more extensive accounting of kernel memory allocated via
     the slab allocators.  At the user level, users will see various kernel
     allocations charged against their memory-control-group limits.  At the
     kernel level, the new <tt>SLAB_ACCOUNT</tt> and <tt>__GFP_ACCOUNT</tt>
     flags are used to mark allocations that should be charged in this
     way.  Among others, <tt>mm_struct</tt>, <tt>vm_area_struct</tt>,
     <tt>dentry</tt>, and <tt>inode</tt> structures are all tracked now.
<p>
<li> As described in <a href="/Articles/667790/">this article</a>, it is
     now possible to increase the range of randomness used for
     address-space layout randomization.  That might increase the security
     of the system, at the possible cost of making huge allocations fail.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/590991/"><tt>MADV_FREE</tt> option to
     <tt>madvise()</tt></a>, which has been under development for some
     time, has finally been merged.  <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> allows an
     application to mark memory that it won't need immediately; the kernel
     can then reclaim that memory preferentially if resources are tight.
<p>
<li> User-space mode-setting support, deprecated for years, has finally
     been removed from the Radeon driver.  With luck, all users have long
     since switched to kernel mode-setting.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
	<p>
	<ul>

	<li> <b>Audio</b>:
	     Cirrus Logic CS47L24 codecs,
	     Imagination Technologies audio controllers,
	     Rockchip rk3036 Inno codecs,
	     Dialog Semiconductor DA7217 and DA7218 audio codecs,
	     Texas Instruments pcm3168a codecs,
	     Pistachio SoC internal digital-to-analog converters,
	     Realtec RT5616 and 5659 codecs, and
	     AMD audio coprocessors.
	<p>
	<li> <b>Graphics</b>:
	     Panasonic VVX10F034N00 1920x1200 video mode panels and
	     Sharp LS043T1LE01 qHD video mode panels.
	     Notably, the "Etnaviv" driver, a free driver for Vivante GPUs,
     	     has finally been merged.  The AMD driver has gained <a
     	     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_PowerPlay">PowerPlay</a>
     	     power-management support.
	<p>
	<li> <b>Industrial I/O</b>:
	     Memsic MXC6255 orientation-sensing accelerometers,
	     TI Palmas general-purpose analog-to-digital converters (ADCs),
	     TI ADS8688 ADCs,
	     TI INA2xx power monitors,
	     Freescale IMX7D ADCs,
	     Freescale MMA7455L/MMA7456L accelerometers,
	     Maxim MAX30100 heart rate and pulse oximeter sensors, and
	     AMS iAQ-Core VOC sensors.
	<p>
	<li> <b>Input</b>:
	     EETI eGalax serial touchscreens and
	     Technologic TS-4800 touchscreens.
	<p>
	<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
	     STMicroelectronics STM32 DMA controllers,
	     Mediatek MT81xx SPI NOR flash controllers,
	     Ingenic JZ4780 NAND flash controllers,
	     HiSilicon SAS SCSI adapters,
	     TI LM363X voltage regulators,
	     TI TPS65086 power regulators,
	     Powerventure Semiconductor PV88060 and PV88090 voltage regulators,
	     Cirrus Logic Fractional-N Clock synthesizer/multipliers,
	     Qualcomm MSM8996 clock controllers,
	     Epson RX8010SJ realtime clocks, and
	     Intel P-Unit mailboxes.
	<p>
	<li> <b>USB</b>:
	     Mediatek MT65xx host controllers,
	     Renesas USB3.0 peripheral controllers,
	     Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 2.0 PHYs,
	     Hisilicon hi6220 USB PHYs, and
	     Moxa UPORT 11x0 serial hubs.
	<p>
	<li> <b>Watchdog</b>:
	     CSR CSRatlas7 watchdogs,
	     Technologic TS-4800 watchdogs,
	     Alphascale ASM9260 watchdogs,
	     Zodiac RAVE watchdog timers,
	     Sigma Designs SMP86xx/SMP87xx watchdogs, and
	     Mediatek SoC watchdogs.
	</ul>	     
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A new version of the <a
     href="/Articles/415714/">media
     controller API</a> has been merged.  As Mauro Carvalho Chehab
     described this work in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/77a76b04d2be1c45b8fd746b7ef754525029340c">the
     pull request</a>: "<q>The goal is to improve the media controller
     to allow proper support for other types of Video4Linux devices (radio
     and TV ones) and to extend the media controller functionality to allow
     it to be used by other subsystems like DVB, ALSA and IIO.</q>"
     Parts of the user-space API remain disabled, though, until 4.6 so some
     final points can be worked out.
<p>
<li> The extensive <a href="/Articles/619738/">huge-page reference
     counting</a> patch set has been merged.  The end goal (supporting
     transparent huge pages in the page cache) has not yet been reached,
     though. 
</ul>
<p>

The most likely day for the closing of the merge window remains
January&nbsp;24.  As usual, we'll cover any final changes that come in
through this merge window in next week's edition.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The linked wiki article about PowerPlay states that it's been superseded by something else, and helpfully includes a table showing this particular branded feature is for R600/R700 era hardware only (circa 2011).<br>
<p>
I'm now confused - is the code's documentation wrong, or will the newer driver eventually replace the radeon one for that hardware?<br>

The merge says it's for "Tonga/Fiji/CZ/ST", which are all Volcanic Islands names: bleeding edge new stuff.<br>
<p>
It appears 'PowerPlay' has been retained internally to mean 'the power management engine' or something like that.<br>

Minor clarification; you could already do O_DIRECT to/from a file on a DAX filesystem.  What didn't work was mmap() a file on a DAX filesystem, and then do O_DIRECT between that mapping and a file on a non-DAX filesystem.<br>

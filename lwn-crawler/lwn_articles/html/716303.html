<h1>Per-task CPU-frequency control</h1>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 8, 2017</br>

The kernel's power-management code attempts to run each processor on the
system at a level that minimizes power consumption while ensuring that
sufficient CPU time is available for the currently running tasks.  CPU
frequency management has, over the last few
years, <a href="/Articles/552885/">become more closely tied to the 
scheduler</a>, since that is where the information about the current workload
resides.  The scheduler, however, does not know which processes are most
important to the user.  Various attempts to fill in that information have
been made over time, with none making it into the mainline; the latest
version takes a different approach. 
<p>
The core idea behind workload-sensitive power management is that the user
(or, more likely, some sort of policy daemon working on the user's behalf)
may want to influence how decisions are made depending on which processes
are running.  For processes that the user would like to see run quickly —
those currently running in the foreground on a handset, for example — it
may be desirable to run the CPU at a higher rate than is strictly necessary
to get the expected amount of work done.  On the other hand, if only a
low-priority background task is running, it may be best to put an upper
limit on how fast the CPU runs, even if that task has a lot of work to do.
At the moment, however, the power-management code cannot distinguish those types
of process from each other, so the same frequency-scaling policies apply to
all of them.
<p>
Recent attempts to solve this problem have taken the form of a
control-group controller called <a href="/Articles/706374/">SchedTune</a>.
This controller allowed a "boost" value to be applied to processes in a
specific control group.  Those processes would be made to appear to require
more CPU time than they actually needed, causing the CPU-frequency governor
to pick a higher frequency than it otherwise would have. This approach
worked, but one might argue that the approach of distorting the apparent
load to influence frequency selection lacked elegance.
<p>
At the end of February, Patrick Bellasi posted <a
href="/Articles/715869/">a new patch set</a> that takes a different
approach.  The separate SchedTune controller is no more; instead,
CPU-frequency policy has been moved into the core CPU controller, where it
can be found alongside the other scheduling parameters for any given
control group.

<p>
The "boost" value and the load-distorting algorithm it used are gone.  In
their place are two new control knobs, called <tt>capacity_min</tt> and
<tt>capacity_max</tt>.  They place bounds on the CPU frequency choices that
can be made when any process in the group is running.  The
<tt>capacity_min</tt> value describes the slowest allowable CPU speed; by
default, it is set to zero, meaning that even the slowest CPU frequency is
acceptable.  The maximum allowable frequency is set by
<tt>capacity_max</tt>; the default value here is 1024, allowing the CPU to
go to its maximum speed.  An important process can thus be guaranteed a
certain minimum CPU performance by setting <tt>capacity_min</tt> to an
appropriate value, while low-priority tasks can be prevented from pushing
the CPU frequency too high with <tt>capacity_max</tt>.
<p>
At any given time, there may be multiple runnable processes, and they may
not all have the same <tt>capacity_min</tt> and <tt>capacity_max</tt>
parameters.  Changing the CPU's operating parameters is a relatively expensive
operation, so it does not make sense to change the operating frequency
every time a new process is given access to the CPU.  One could also argue
that, when a process with relatively high CPU-power requirements is
waiting, the other processes should be run at just as high a power level to
avoid delaying that process excessively.
<p>
The end result is that the scheduler needs to pick a set of parameters that
is suitable for all of the processes that are currently runnable.  To meet that
requirement, the controller will apply the maximum value of both
parameters.  That ensures that the process(es) with the highest values will
actually get those values, and no process will run at a lower CPU frequency
than it is entitled to.  Implementing this policy requires adding two <a
href="/Articles/184495/">red-black trees</a> to each control group tracking
the processes with the highest <tt>capacity_min</tt> and
<tt>capacity_max</tt> values.
<p>
When multiple levels of control groups are in use, subgroups are only
allowed to tighten the constraints set in their parent groups.  So
<tt>capacity_min</tt> in a subgroup cannot go below that value in the
parent, while <tt>capacity_max</tt> cannot exceed the parent's value. 
<p>
In previous patch sets, this feature has been focused on the
<tt>SCHED_OTHER</tt> (normal) 
scheduling class.  With this patch set, though, it has also been extended
to the realtime and deadline scheduling classes.  In current kernels, those
classes are run at the maximum speed the processor supports.  With this
change, realtime and deadline scheduling can be used in a more
power-friendly mode.  Needless to say, tuning of these parameters with such
workloads will need to be done carefully to avoid configuring a system that
cannot meet its realtime requirements.
<p>
As of this writing, there have been no comments on the new patch set.
That, perhaps, is one of the hazards of posting core-kernel patches during
the merge window.  One might guess that this version offers relatively
little to complain about, but experience suggests that one might easily
guess incorrectly when it comes to scheduler patches.  Once the scheduler
developers have a chance to look at this code, we'll have a better idea of
whether it's likely to get into the mainline in its current form.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
It would seem that a long-running saga in kernel development may be coming 
to a close.  Stacking (also composing or chaining) of Linux Security
Modules (LSMs) has 
 been discussed, debated, and developed in kernel security circles for many
 years; we have <a
 href="/Articles/315974/">looked</a> at the issue from a number of angles
 starting in 2009 (and <a
 href="/Articles/316940/">here</a>), but <a
 href="/Articles/109713/">patches</a> go back to at least 2004.  After
 multiple fits and starts, it looks like something might finally make its
 way into the mainline kernel.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the problem is that any security enhancements that are
suggested for the kernel are inevitably <a
href="/Articles/393008/">pushed</a> toward the LSM API.  But 
there can only be one LSM active in a given kernel instance and most
distributions already have that slot filled.  
Linux capabilities would logically be implemented in an LSM, but that would
conflict with any other module that was loaded.  To get around that
problem, capabilities have been
hardwired into each LSM, so that the capability checks are done as needed by
those modules.  The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt">Yama LSM</a> has
also been manually stacked, if it is configured into the kernel, by calling
its four hooks before the hooks from the 
active LSM are called.  These are <i>ad hoc</i> solutions that cannot
really be used for additional modules that might need to all be active, so a better 
way has been sought.

<p>
The last time we <a href="/Articles/569861/">looked in on the issue</a> was
after the 2013 Linux Security Summit (LSS).  Smack creator Casey Schaufler, who
has been 
the most recent one to push stacking, presented his solution to attendees;
he was
looking for feedback on his approach.  Schaufler's <a href="/Articles/560802/">proposal</a> was a complex solution that
attempted to solve "all" of the stacking problems at once.  In particular,
it allowed using more than one of the LSMs that provide a full security model
(the so-called "monolithic" LSMs: SELinux, Smack, TOMOYO, and AppArmor), which
is a bit hard to justify in 
some eyes.  For most, the pressing need for stacking is to support several single-purpose
LSMs atop one of those monolithic security models, much like is done with Yama. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, Schaufler's patches tried to handle network packet labeling for
multiple LSMs (to the extent possible) and added to the user-space interface
under <tt>/proc/PID/attr</tt>.   Each active LSM would have a subdirectory
under <tt>attr</tt>
with its attributes, while one LSM, chosen through a configuration
option, would present its attributes in the main <tt>attr</tt> directory.
These additions also added complexity, so the consensus that emerged
from the 2013 LSS attendees was to go back to the basics. 
</p>

<p>
Schaufler has been working on that simplification.  The 21st version of the
patch set was <a href="/Articles/636056/">posted</a> on March&nbsp;9,
though the changes in this round are mostly just tweaks.  The <a
href="/Articles/634622/">previous version</a> picked 
 up an ack from Yama developer Kees Cook, was tested by SELinux developer
Stephen Smalley, and got a "<q>this version looks almost perfect</q>"
from TOMOYO developer Tetsuo Handa.  It looks like it could get into
security maintainer James
Morris's branch targeting the -next tree, which might mean we will see it
in 4.1.
</p>

<p>
The approach this time is a return to a much simpler world.  Gone are the
thoughts of stacking more than one monolithic LSM; this proposal creates a
mechanism to stack the LSM hooks and to consult them when trying to decide
on access requests.  
The interface for a given LSM used to be a <tt>struct security_operations</tt> that
was filled out with pointers for each of the hooks to be called when making
access decisions. That has been replaced with a union
(<tt>security_list_options</tt>) that can hold a pointer to each of the
different hook functions.  That union is meant to allow for a single list
type that can hold any of 
the hook functions, but still provide type checking. 


<p>
Instead of filling in the sparse
<tt>security_operations</tt> structure, LSMs
now initialize an array that contains each of their hooks.  That gets handed off
to the <tt>security_add_hooks()</tt> function that adds the hooks to the
lists for each hook that the LSM infrastructure maintains internally.
Those lists are initialized with the capabilities hooks; Yama hooks are
then added if that LSM is configured for the kernel.  For the rest of the
LSMs, all of which are monolithic, only one can be chosen at boot time to
have its hooks added to the list.

<p>
When an access decision needs to be made, the hooks are called in
the order that they were added.  Unlike some previous iterations, the access
checking will terminate when any of the hooks on the list denies access.  If none do,
then the access is allowed. 
</p>

<p>
That puts all of the machinery in place to provide stacking, but it doesn't
allow choosing more than one of the monolithic LSMs on any given kernel
boot. 
Multiple monolithic LSMs can be configured into the kernel, and one
be specified as the default, but that can be overridden with the
<tt>security=</tt> kernel boot 
parameter.  New LSMs could be added to the kernel code,
like Yama has been, but those will presumably be configured into the kernel
at build time. 

<p>
Currently, Yama is the only smaller LSM in the tree and it is chosen (or
not) at build time; the
others are either not optional (capabilities) or can only have a single
chosen representative added into the hook list at kernel initialization
time.  Essentially, Schaufler's patches avoid 
multiple monolithic modules that are active in a given boot by not providing a
mechanism to choose more 
than one.  That avoids the conflicts and complexity that earlier attempts
had run aground on.  As he noted:
<div class="BigQuote">
The stacking of modules that use the security blob pointers
cred-&gt;security, inode-&gt;i_security, etc has not been addressed.
That is future work with a delightful set of issues.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Another change that Schaufler has made is to split the <tt>security.h</tt>
header file for LSMs 
in two: one for the internal, common LSM-handling mechanism (which stays in
<tt>security.h</tt>) and one that defines
the hooks and macros that will be used by LSMs (which is contained in the
new <tt>lsm_hooks.h</tt> file).  While that change is large in terms of
lines of code, it is largely janitorial, but it will make the interface
boundaries clearer.
</p>

<p>
If Schaufler's patches make it into the mainline, that may spur some of the
smaller out-of-tree LSMs to "come in from the cold" and get submitted to
the mainline.  It may also help to remove the "single LSM" barrier that crops up
when new security protections are proposed for the kernel.  Providing a
mechanism to support these kinds of protections, while steering clear of core kernel
code, could lead to more of those protections in the mainline and,
eventually, available in distributions. It will be interesting to see what
<i>that</i> leads.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm assuming that all the end user will see is EACCES/EPERM.  The critical issue to me is that we get more detailed debug when a permission check fails, and ideally from the kernel instead of having to dig around in separate SELinux/AppArmor/other tools and log files.<br>

For every failed access decision, generate a random token (e.g. a UUID), record that token both in the LSM's audit logs and return it to the calling process, which then logs it using its usual mechanisms (e.g. print to stderr, write to some log file etc). Provide a utility which requires elevated privileges to run (e.g. root, membership of some group, etc), which when given such a token, scans the LSM's audit logs, and generates the detailed information on why the access attempt was rejected. That way, there is no information leak - you need to be privileged to find out why the access attempt failed - but for those with privilege it should be easier than it is at present.<br>

Among other things, there are a lot of academic works. Of course, as many prototypes from the academy, they're not actively maintained but if it's possible to stack LSM hooks, this may be an incentive for companies to have a look at them, maintain them and push them to the official kernel.<br>

      I did a quick check at my file <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/misc/stacker.c">stacker.c</a> - and its last version dates back to 2002-09-04.  That file was not ready for production use (as noted in the comments), but still, it shows that people have been interested in stacking for easily more than a decade.  I'm really glad to see LSM stacking finally in the Linux kernel.  Congrats to all involved!

<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
There are a handful of extensions to the "new" mount API that Christian
Brauner wanted to discuss as part of a filesystem session at 
the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  In the session, though,
the only one that he got to was a followup to last year's <a
href="/Articles/932648/">discussion on mount-operation monitoring</a>.
There is a need for user-space programs to be able to follow mount
operations (e.g. mount and unmount) that happen in the system, especially
for tools like container
managers or systemd.
</p>

<p>
He began by briefly listing the potential topics in his <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SJb0T1vpXN2wP61OwC729WcBEI9MMdOPwLW-OWhp-VI/">slides</a>,
but noted that he was doubtful that he would get far into the list—or even
past the first.  He chose to focus on mount-operation monitoring (or mount notifications) as it is "the
most pressing and interesting issue for user space".  The idea is that
user-space tools can register for mount-related events, which will allow
them to track the state of the mount tree.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/980475/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/lsfmb-brauner2-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Christian Brauner]" title="Christian Brauner" width=208 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Brauner thinks the right
way forward is to use <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/filesystem-monitoring.html">fanotify</a>,
rather than the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/159645997768.1779777.8286723139418624756.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">watch-queue-based
notifications</a> that David Howells had originally proposed.
Howells clarified that his patches were meant to also provide a way for
user space to query the mount topology using a new system call; the
notification part was implemented on top of <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/watch_queue.html">watch queues</a>.
</p>

<p>
He said that fanotify has "a lot of desirable properties, such as
missed-event notifications when the queue overruns".  He said that Josef
Bacik had some experience with the problems of queue overruns for some
systems running
container workloads with events from up to 10,000 mounts that were
propagated all over the mount tree.  Brauner thinks that the overrun
problem has been solved at this point, however. Programs can use <a
href="/Articles/950569/"><tt>listmount()</tt></a> with the unique 64-bit
mount ID when they find out that they have missed events; that will give them
the mount IDs of child mounts that they can further query.
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein said that the information needed could also be part of the
event message when the mount notification happens, preferably as a <a href="/Articles/375888/">file
handle</a> for the mount.  Brauner agreed that made sense, rather than
returning an <tt>O_PATH</tt> file descriptor, which is another option.
That kind of file descriptor would allow opening any mount on the system,
so it provides "an extremely privileged interface", while a file handle
would not.
</p>

<p>
There is a need to "decide which objects we want to watch", Goldstein said;
will the watches be placed on parent mounts or on subtrees?  Brauner said
that Howells's patches could watch an entire mount namespace or subtrees.
There are use cases where you want to watch all of the mounts in a
container, Brauner said, so that is where a mount-namespace watch would
make sense; there are also services that only use a subtree so they will
want to only get events for that part of the tree. 
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Goldstein agreed that it made sense to have both, but was not sure how to
implement the subtree watches.  Brauner said that there is a potential race
condition because new mounts in the subtree do not inherit the watch, so
any mounts that happen before it is established might be lost.  He is not
sure that is a real problem, so long as there is a way to query the state
of the mount tree right after the watch is established on a new mount.  Jan
Kara said that a watch only gets informed about events for the immediate
children of a mount, which makes implementing a recursive mount watch
in user space painful.
</p>

<p>
The whole reason for adding mount notifications is to perform better than
the existing practice, which involves frequently parsing
<tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt>, so some performance numbers should be
gathered, Brauner said. It should be faster "and I'm pretty sure that it
is, but we should have some numbers".
</p>

<p>
Solving the mount-notification problem is something that filesystem
developers "should aim to get done this year", he said.  It is
longstanding and "kind of a shame that we have not correctly solved it
yet". Goldstein said that there have been performance problems with
recursive watches in the past, but those were for directories, which have a
higher volume of events than mounts; he does not see that as a real problem
for mounts.
</p>

<p>
Brauner asked about the interaction between mount notifications and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><tt>pivot_root()</tt></a>;
he wondered if any watches on the old root were copied to the new as part
of that operation.  Howells said that because the watches are associated
with the mount object, not the mount namespace directly, they would get
lost when <tt>pivot_root()</tt> is called.  The discussion seemed to
indicate that something would need to be done to maintain the watches in
that case.
</p>

<p>
The session wrapped up with a bit of discussion on implementation; Brauner
said that he had wanted to get something working for a while now.
Goldstein said that once an API was decided on, it would not be all that
hard to implement mount notifications.  Howells said that his code could be
used as a starting point.  Goldstein suggested that a simple API for
watching child mounts of a given parent would be straightforward to
develop, then additions could be made for more complicated scenarios
(presumably for things like recursive watches) based on that work.

fanotify seems to require global CAP_SYS_ADMIN permissions to do most interesting operations. Would you be able to use the suggested fanotify API to monitor for mounts in an entire unprivileged user+mount namespace where you have CAP_SYS_ADMIN only within the namespace?<br>
<p>
I see a very terse mention in the slide about permissions:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Opt-in way of getting an O_PATH fd or file handle to the mount. (File handle might be more “secure” because to turn it into an fd you need CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH /* ToDo: explore to relax to ns_capable(mountdirfd-&gt;mnt_ns-&gt;user_ns) */)</span><br>
<p>
but I am not sure what it means :) and it kind of sounds like it's talking about permissions about accessing the mounts reported in a notification event, not permissions to set up the notification in the first place.<br>

File handles are something a filesystem guarantees as unique, but you can't do anything with them unless you have CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, the permission root and typically no other user has that means "ignore file permissions".<br>

CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH doesn't mean "ignore file permissions"; that's what CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is. CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH is useful for backups for example, where you want to be able to read every file and traverse every directory (hence the name) but nothing else, like changing owner (CAP_CHOWN), changing permissions (CAP_FOWNER), etc. It does not grant you any modification privileges you did not already have.<br>

Fair enough; you're right that it only ignores read and search permissions, thank you for the correction. It's still not a permission you want to give to a random application, though. So file handles are still not useful for ordinary applications.<br>

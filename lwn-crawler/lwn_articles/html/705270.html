<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2016/">2016 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The final core-day session at the 2016 Kernel Summit, run by Steve "Batman"
Rostedt and Shuah Khan, concerned the use of tracepoints in the kernel.  It
started with a discussion of tracepoint performance issues, but quickly
came around to the perennial 
area of concern about tracepoints: whether they form part of the kernel's
user-space ABI or not.
<p>
Steve started by noting that he is seeing an "explosion" in the number of
tracepoints being added.  The problem is that, while the cost
of tracepoints has been made as low as possible, they are still not free.  Each
tracepoint hurts performance slightly.  So it may eventually become
necessary to limit the addition of tracepoints into the kernel.
<p>
David Howells noted that a number of maintainers have been seen to push
back on the addition of <tt>printk()</tt> calls to the kernel, saying that
tracepoints should be used instead.  Steve responded that they should push
back on tracepoints too.  Each tracepoint should have its own rationale

<a href="/Articles/705279/"><img

justifying its existence.  Chris Mason suggested that the best way to cut
down on tracepoints is to require developers to document them.
<p>
Mel Gorman reminded the group that tracepoints can be inserted dynamically
into a running kernel.  Mark Brown said that dynamic tracepoints require
more tooling; that may be fine for a server system, but is harder on a
phone.  But Steve said that no special tools are required to insert
tracepoints; it can all be done with <tt>echo</tt> commands.  
<p>
Shuah brought things around to the ABI issue by saying that tracepoints can
be highly effective for debugging problems on deployed systems.  But, she
asked, if we add tracepoints, do we have to maintain them forever?  Ted
Ts'o noted that the current work with eBPF makes tracepoints far easier to
use, a change with both good and bad aspects.  On the good side, the kernel
now has dynamic tracing capabilities approaching those of DTrace.  On the
other hand, that means that people are starting to use these capabilities,
and system administrators are starting to depend on them.  So the ABI issue
is no longer theoretical.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra said that there are tracepoints in the scheduler now that he
would like to remove, but fears he can't without breaking things.  Linus,
though, said that problematic tracepoints should simply be taken out,
especially if they are hindering development.  This should happen even if
the removal would break the LatencyTOP tool.  Greg Kroah-Hartman protested
that, in the past, Linus had <a href="/Articles/442113/">blocked a
tracepoint change</a> that broke the <a
href="https://01.org/powertop">PowerTOP</a> utility.  Linus's answer is 
that the community was still figuring out how to work with tracepoints
then, and that there was no actual need to break PowerTOP at that time.
<p>
But, he said, tracepoints are still a view into the kernel's internals.
They have to be able to change over time.  If the removal of a particular
tracepoint proves to be painful for user space, that removal will have to
be reconsidered, but only then.  That, he said, has always been the ABI
rule: we can change things, but, if the result is broken user space, we'll
change it back.  Additionally, he said, LatencyTOP users tend to be people
who compile their kernels anyway, while PowerTOP users are not.  So
LatencyTOP users can better adjust to a tracepoint change.
<p>
And, in the end, Linus said, if a tracepoint becomes so useful that it
becomes part of 
the ABI, there is probably a good reason for it and it likely should be
kept.  But the way to find out is to change things and see who screams.
<p>
Ted suggested that now would be a good time to look at Brendan Gregg's <a
href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools">perf-tools</a> set to see
which tracepoints it depends on.  If those tracepoints need adjustment to
be supportable in the long run, now is the time to make those changes
before the usage of those tools increases further.
<p>
Some maintainers may feel better now about allowing tracepoints in the code
they are responsible for, but others have not changed their view.  Al Viro
made it clear that his policy would not be changing, and that he would not
be allowing any tracepoints in the virtual filesystem layer.  He is worried
about how some developers may use those tracepoints, and does not want to
see a day in the future where systems are unable to boot with newer kernels
as the result of tracepoint changes.
<p>
The session concluded with Linus saying that, in the history of kernel
development, nobody has ever screamed about a change to a tracepoint.  He
allowed that this might happen as the use of tracepoints increases.  But,
he said, there is no point in making a big deal about that possibility
before it proves to be a problem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's worth noting that while you *can* add trace points by hand the UI for doing that is very much more complex than that for just turning on one that exists already.<br>

      The issue seems to be similar to that of performance monitoring events in CPUs: While CPU architects are very reluctant at changing existing architectural features, because they don't want to break programs, they have shown little restraint in changing the performance monitoring event interfaces, and which events one can monitor.  In particular, the events for specific microarchitectural features come and go as the microarchitecture changes.  However, because, e.g., instructions, branch instructions, and memory accesses are architectural features, there have always been events for that.  Events for common microarchitectural features like branch prediction and cache hits/misses have also been common.

DTrace has long had facilities for defining the stability of tracepoints (well, actually providers, but there's no reason the same thing couldn't be implemented at the tracepoint level). It sounds like the kernel needs something similar, so that tracepoints that are generic enough and seem to be widely used can be declared stable, and the rest can vanish at any time.<br>

The non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) was designed around the idea
that there are two types of memory on complex systems: local (faster) and
remote (slower).  During the memory-management track of the 2018 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Anshuman Khandual
asserted that the situation has since become rather more complicated.
Perhaps, he said, the time has come to rethink how we view NUMA systems.
<p>
On upcoming hardware, Khandual said, there are memory interfaces that can deal
with numerous types of memory, all of which ends up looking like DRAM.
Memory can vary in parameters like  bandwidth, persistence, latency, and
power consumption.

Applications may want to take advantage of this diversity by, for example, putting an
important but rarely accessed data structure in low-power memory, reserving
the faster (and more power-hungry) memory for data that must be closer to
hand.  A lot of 
this kind of control can be achieved now with <tt>mmap()</tt>, but that
approach leaves no room for integration with the memory-management
subsystem.  For example, there is no migration of pages between
different memory types in response to the system workload.  Things would
work better if the kernel had a better understanding of memory attributes.
<p>
There is, he said, an existing solution using the current NUMA abstraction:
create new nodes to hold slower memory and set the distance value
accordingly.  Applications can then map memory into those zones if they
want, but pages should not end up there by default.  Special memory should
not be used like normal memory.  Matthew Wilcox replied that this might not always
be the case; if the alternative is to put the system into an out-of-memory
panic, it might be better to allocate pages from a slow zone.  That is
what happens now, Khandual said; with sufficient memory pressure, pages
will be placed in the special zones — but, depending on the nature of those
zones, that might not be desirable.
<p>
Khandual suggested keeping more attribute information inside NUMA zones,
perhaps tagging the memory with different zone or migration types.  That would
help to prevent implicit allocations in those zones.  
Beyond unwanted spillover, the simple fact is that node distance is not
enough to capture the differences between different types of memory.
For example, Jérôme Glisse said, a system with two GPUs may have a faster
link between them; memory allocations on one GPU should fall back to the
other if need be, but there is no way to express that in the kernel now.
<p>
If some way is found to encapsulate memory attributes into NUMA nodes,
there still needs to be a way to get that information out to user space so
applications can make use of it.  There was talk of a new sysfs interface,
but there were also worries that it could grow too large on a system with a
lot of nodes. 
Perhaps what is needed, Khandual suggested, is a new API to request memory
with specific attributes.
<p>
That suggestion concerned Dave Hansen, who said that this kind of API would
require a lot of thought and is fraught with pitfalls.  The original plans
for NUMA support included a lot of options, but most of them turned out not
to be needed in the real world.  We are, he said, terrible at designing
interfaces in general; there is no way that we would get it right when the
hardware we are designing for is not even available yet.

Instead, he said, the thing to do is to find the places where the current
NUMA interface isn't working now, then build a case for small additions to
the API when they make sense.  But, to the extent that it is possible, it
would be better to rely on the existing APIs for now.
<p>
The session concluded with a warning to Khandual that, in typical
memory-management fashion, he would be invited to the next five annual LSFMM
events to give reports on how the work is progressing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>I'm reminded of the quote "<a href="http://comp.lang.asm.x86.narkive.com/jf59StvF/almost-all-programming-can-be-viewed-as-an-exercise-in-caching#post2">almost all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching</a>" (by Terje Mathisen I think).  It seems like these "levels of memory" are, at a sufficiently abstract level, just more memory layers like L1/L2/L3/... cache in a storage hierachy that ends with, eg, "spinning rust".  So possibly considering "0, 1, many" (eg, from data modelling) might be a reasonable option here -- in that view "2" (local/remote) is a rather special case implementation that will almost inevitably want to become more than 2 at some point...</p>

<p>PS: This potentially also applies to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752969/">Exposing storage devices as memory</a>, in that "another layer of abstraction" way.... :-)</p>

      Great news. The NUMA structure needs definitely a big re-thinking given the new rends related to storage class memories.

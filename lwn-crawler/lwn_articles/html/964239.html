           </div>
The kernel's memory-management subsystem is built on the concept of
"zones", which were initially added to describe the physical
characteristics of the memory pages contained within them.  Over time,
zones have taken on more of a policy-related role as well.  With a patch
set called <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20240229183436.4110845-1-yuzhao@google.com/">THP
allocator optimizations</a>, Yu Zhao has set out to better define the role
of policy-related zones on the path toward adding two more of them, with
the ultimate purpose of improving the kernel's support for transparent huge
pages (THPs).
<p>
<h4>The history zone</h4>
<p>
A bit of background might help to set the context for this patch series.
<p>
The earliest x86 systems that ran Linux talked to peripheral devices via
the ISA bus, which was only able to address 16MB of memory, using 24-bit
addresses.  Even in those days, computers often had more memory than that,
meaning that some memory could not be used by ISA devices for DMA I/O
operations.  That made life inconvenient for any device drivers that might
happen to allocate a DMA buffer in memory inaccessible by the devices they
were trying to control.
<p>
To avoid this problem, the kernel added the <tt>GFP_DMA</tt> allocation
flag in 1.1.68, in November 1994.  That flag didn't actually <i>do</i>
anything until 1.1.69, and was not used until the Buslogic SCSI driver
added support in 1.1.73.  This flag asked the memory-management subsystem
to allocate memory within the physical address range that was reachable by
ISA devices, so that driver authors no longer needed to worry when
allocating buffers.
<p>
At that time, <tt>GFP_DMA</tt> simply caused the allocator to skip over
memory that was not suitably located.  That worked, but life, as is its
wont, became more complicated.  The kernel, in the early days, could only
manage a bit less than 1GB of physical memory; the 32-bit address space, as
partitioned by the kernel, simply could not contain any more.  That nearly
1GB, of course, ought to have been enough for anybody.  But users can be
rather strident when it comes to being able to use all of the memory they
paid for, so kernel developers came under pressure to find a solution.
<p>
That solution was "high memory", which could be allocated to user-processes
but could not be directly addressed by the kernel without an explicit (and
temporary) mapping step.  High memory was added to 2.3.23pre3 in late 1999, 
adding another type of memory that had to be taken into account;
memory used by the kernel usually could not be placed there.  To deal with
these constraints, the concept of "memory types" was added to 2.3.23pre5.
That concept was then formalized into "zones" in the 2.3.27 release in
November 1999.  At that time, there were three zones: <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>,
<tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>, and <tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt>.
<p>
An important aspect of the zone system is that the zones were organized in
an order that allowed for a straightforward fallback mechanism.  Any
allocation that could be served out of <tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt> could also be
satisfied from either of the other two zones, and <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>
allocations could fall back to <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>.  That property still
holds in current kernels.
<p>
The 2.6.15 kernel, released in January 2006, saw the addition of
<tt>ZONE_DMA32</tt>, wedged between <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> and
<tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>, to meet the needs of devices that could only handle
32-bit DMA addresses.  In 2.6.23 (October 2007), <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> was
added, and <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> showed up in 4.3 (November 2015) to describe
CPU-addressable memory installed on peripheral devices.
<p>
To an extent, all of these zones describe physical characteristics of the
memory involved, mostly relating to addressability.  <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>
is a bit of an exception, though.  It describes memory where, with luck,
all of the contents can be moved elsewhere if need be.  User-space pages,
for example, can be migrated elsewhere in memory; the page-table entries
will be updated accordingly, and user space will never know that anything
changed.  This zone was added to support hotplug memory that could be added
to (or removed from) a system at any time.  If memory is to be removed from
a system, it is somewhat important to shift all of the contents of the
memory elsewhere first.
<p>
The hotplug use case still exists, but <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> has become
more of an expression of memory-management policy.  If all of the movable
pages are put in the same region of memory, it is relatively easy to
reclaim some of that memory to, for example, create large, physically
contiguous ranges.  So now <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> is used as a way of
separating movable and non-movable allocations, and provides important
support for, among other things, the <a href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous
memory allocator</a>.  The important point here is that
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> can be placed anywhere in physical memory; it is not
driven by the physical characteristics of that memory, especially on the
large majority of systems where hotplugging is not in use.
<p>
In current kernels, the zone hierarchy is:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>
<li> <tt>ZONE_DMA32</tt>
<li> <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>
<li> <tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt>
<li> <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>
<li> <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Note, though, that not all zones are present on all systems; current 64-bit
systems, for example, have no need for <tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt>.

<h4>Explicit policy zones</h4>
<p>
Zhao has come to the conclusion that more can be done with the idea of a
memory zone as an aid to allocation policy.  Specifically, he argues that
there may be a use for a couple of other policy zones (which are often
called "virtual zones" in the code itself).  To that end, his patch series
adds:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>ZONE_NOSPLIT</tt>, which is a zone where contiguous blocks of
     pages cannot be split below a given size.  It exists to help the
     system maintain large blocks of memory (to use for transparent huge
     pages, among other things) without having to go through a continual
     process of compaction.
<li> <tt>ZONE_NOMERGE</tt> also has the minimum block-size property, but
     also disallows the merging of blocks of pages into bigger groups; as a
     result, it can only hold chunks of a single size.  
</ul>
<p>
These zones, which are placed after <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>, maintain the
fallback hierarchy: a <tt>ZONE_NOMERGE</tt> allocation can also be
satisfied from <tt>ZONE_NOSPLIT</tt>, or from one of the lower zones if
that fails.  Allocations from these zones must be movable, so a fallback to
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> is possible as well.
<p>
The idea behind these zones is to make the allocation of transparent huge
pages as efficient as possible.  They will prevent the splitting of huge
pages, which will keep the kernel from having to go through the effort of
reassembling them later.  Much of the work that currently goes into
compaction could become unnecessary.
<p>
In a sense, this work can be seen as a sort of compromise between those who
would like to see Linux use a larger page size overall and those who worry
about the associated internal-fragmentation cost.  <tt>ZONE_NOMERGE</tt>
creates something close to a second native page size for the kernel, making
larger pages available in situations where they make sense while still
keeping smaller pages available.
<p>
Internal fragmentation can still be a problem with transparent huge pages,
though; a process may have such a page allocated, but only be using a small
portion of the memory within it.  Current kernels will try to respond to
this situation by splitting huge pages back into base pages, allowing the
unused parts to be reallocated elsewhere.
<p>
Splitting clearly cannot happen with pages located in (or above)
<tt>ZONE_NOSPLIT</tt>; that is exactly the policy that zone exists to
enforce.  Instead, Zhao's patch set introduces the concept of "shattering"
huge pages.  If a page is shattered, its contents are migrated (copied)
to smaller pages located in a suitable zone; once that process completes,
the original huge page, which remains intact, can be allocated to another
use.  Shattering is more expensive than splitting; Zhao sees it as an
appropriate cost for a process not properly using its memory; from <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20240229183436.4110845-3-yuzhao@google.com/">the
changelog</a>: "<q>In retail terms, the return of a purchase is charged
with a restocking fee and the original goods can be resold</q>".
<p>
Another claimed advantage of <tt>ZONE_NOMERGE</tt> is that it facilitates
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/mm/vmemmap_dedup.html">huge
vmemmap optimization (HVO)</a>, which was <a
href="/Articles/839737/">covered here</a> in 2020.  In short, this trick
allows the kernel to recover the memory used to hold <tt>page</tt>
structures for many of the pages in a huge page.  In a system where a lot
of huge pages are in use, this optimization can save a significant amount
of memory.

In current kernels, HVO can only be used with the hugetlbfs mechanism,
which is not transparent and is normally only used in specialized
situations.  <tt>ZONE_NOMERGE</tt> pages are organized in fixed blocks,
though, like hugetlbfs pages, so it becomes easy to use HVO with them.
<p>
The patch set is in an early stage; among other things, it does not have
any sort of benchmark results showing the advantages of this new machinery.
Review comments from other developers are just beginning to come in; it is
a significant chunk of work and will take some time to digest.  It is
likely to be a discussion topic at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> in May.  The new zones
will thus probably not land in the kernel in the near future, but their
advantages might prove compelling in the longer term.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The point of <code>ZONE_NOMERGE</code> is unclear.  It seems that it is intended for huge pages.  Right?  And these pages are neither going to be split nor merged.  Right?  But I would not expect huge pages to be merged into even bigger pages anyway, so if we have <code>ZONE_NOMERGE</code>, what's the practical difference from <code>ZONE_NOSPLIT</code>?

      Anymore, huge pages can take many sizes other than the PMD size, so they might well be merged.

      A little bit of search <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/mm/page_tables.html">revealed</a> that PMD means "page middle directory", which is the level of page table entries right above ordinary pages, in the common case 2MB PMD pages for 4KB small pages.

<p>Sure, there is also the next level (PUD), with (in the common case) 1GB pages (and 512GB at the next level, if that is supported by the MMU), but it seems to me that the benefits of lower TLB misses and lower page table sizes are so small compared to the cost of more internal fragmentation that those pages are not appropriate for transparent huge pages (unlike for the 4KB-to-2MB step), only for explicit huge pages.

      Sorry, I was brief this morning.  Think in terms of, for example, <a href="/Articles/937239/">large anonymous folios</a>, which are <i>smaller</i> than PMD huge pages.  I've often seen the term "huge pages" used for those as well, even though they aren't implemented as such in the page tables and are significantly less huge.

Thanks for the article and questions!<br>
<p>
A few concrete examples might help. (And sorry for not giving any in the LSF/MM proposal.)<br>
<p>
1. If client workloads like Android want to use 64KB (PTE-mapped) THPs, without ZONE_NOMERGE the buddy allocator would try to merge up to order 10, i.e., 4MB, which is far beyond what's suitable for client devices. 2MB THPs have been proven detrimental for many client workloads, e.g., Android and ChromeOS, etc. because of their relatively low memory configurations and THP overhead (allocation latency and internal fragmentation). Even server workloads like Redis don't recommend THPs [1], and this is not uncommon.<br>
<p>
2. If server workloads like Google's datacenter want to use both 2MB and 32KB THPs at the same time because of multi-tenancy, e.g., 2MB to back VMs and 32KB for Redis on the same server, both ZONE_NOSPLIT and ZONE_NOMERGE would be needed. And when ZONE_NOMERGE is full, it'd try to allocate 2MB THPs from ZONE_NOSPLIT, which covers buddy page sizes from 32KB to 4MB. And the fallback can continue until it reaches the lowest zone.<br>
<p>
3. ZONE_NOSPLIT alone would be useful if a system enables more than two sizes of (PTE-mapped) THPs, e.g., 16KB, 32KB, 64KB, etc. At the moment, this example has no concrete use cases, since (PTE-mapped) THP support is a new feature in v6.8.  At the moment, it's not ready for production systems because many pieces like (PTE-mapped) THP swap in/out are still under development/review. Hopefully client workloads can start using it in a few years.<br>

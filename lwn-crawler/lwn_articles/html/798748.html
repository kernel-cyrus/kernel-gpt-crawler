<p>Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a set of security-related
instructions for Intel processors; it allows the creation of private
regions of memory, called "enclaves". The aim of this feature is to work
like an inverted sandbox: instead of protecting the system from malicious
code, it protects an application from a compromised kernel hypervisor,
or other application. Linux support for SGX has existed out-of-tree
for years, and the effort of upstreaming it has reached an
impressive <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190903142655.21943-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/">version
22 of the patch set</a>. During the upstreaming discussion, the kernel
developers <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrV=wAsyWxtxQJ7y0xNrzkE863hTfU6Ysej48Gk9yPFJZw@mail.gmail.com/">discovered</a>
that the proposed SGX API did not play nicely with existing security
mechanisms, including Linux security modules
(LSMs). </p>

<h4>SGX and enclaves</h4>

<p>SGX allows creation of memory regions that are expected to host a
sensitive part of an application, such as the handling of private keys.
Both the sensitive data and the code that manages it live within the
enclave; except for defined entry points, they are inaccessible outside of
it. In addition, the enclave code 
and data are encrypted in memory with ephemeral keys.</p>

<p>The enclaves <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190903142655.21943-24-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/">have
their own page-protection regime</a>, as they are isolated from the rest of
the system.  The memory used by the enclave is handled separately
from main system memory and the enclave must fit into a single contiguous
linear virtual-memory range. With those constraints, loading the enclave
requires 
specific preparations, including some assembly code. Interested readers can
find an example <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190903142655.21943-21-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/">in
the SGX self-test code</a>.</p>

<p>The enclave is managed, from the Linux side, by a device driver (LWN <a
href="/Articles/786487/">looked into it</a> in April
and, in 2016, <a href="/Articles/686808/">in the
context of memory encryption</a>). It handles memory management within the
enclave.  The management API for SGX enclaves
includes a mix of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls to create an enclave, to add a
page, and to
initialize the enclave; it works along with with a few special SGX CPU
instructions.</p> 

<h4>SGX and LSMs</h4>

<p>In the discussion about the SGX security model, Greg Wettstein <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190418171059.GA20819@wind.enjellic.com/">pointed
out</a> that the SGX API did not provide verification of the enclave
code. He also mentioned an <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08719.pdf">attack [PDF]</a> using SGX
that allows malicious code running inside an enclave to steal data from an
application.  That makes the enclave code a possible security threat in its
own right.
<p>
Preventing such attacks requires that the kernel have control
over which code can be run within an enclave.
Andy Lutomirski
pointed out that software verification is already available in Linux in
the form of LSM policies and 
noted
that there might be a bigger issue as well. While security policies in many
systems do not 
allow applications to create executable memory regions with arbitrary content,
the SGX API does allow exactly that. He wrote:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    There are many, many Linux systems that enforce a policy that *all*
    executable text needs to come from a verified source.  On these systems,
    you can't mmap some writable memory, write to it, and then change it to
    executable. [...]
    Unless I'm missing it, the current SGX API is entirely incompatible
    with this model.
</div></p>

<p>This conclusion (reasonably) upset the kernel developers, adding to
the list of known issues with SGX in general (the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX
Wikipedia page</a> contains a list of other problems). Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjmT=uC1=18ZYV1CMfP_FBUEjh9_rabH0g+a0z-L0cgHg@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
that circumventing LSM policies was a fatal flaw:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    And if the current setup basically is "you have to disable reasonable
    SELinux protections that lots of distros use today", I think it's
    entirely reasonable saying "the downsides are bigger than the
    upsides".
</div></p>

<p>The consensus among the developers was that the control over  enclave
page loading must be given to the LSMs. An extensive <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CALCETrXf8mSK45h7sTK5Wf+pXLVn=Bjsc_RLpgO-h-qdzBRo5Q@mail.gmail.com/">discussion</a>
on the linux-security-module mailing list explored the interactions
between the LSMs and SGX in great detail.</p>

<h4>Details of the problem</h4>

<p>In the SGX driver implementation, all enclaves are backed by the same device
file (<tt>/dev/sgx/enclave</tt>). This allows SGX users to use ordinary system
calls (including <tt>mmap()</tt> and <tt>ioctl()</tt>) to move
pages to and from the SGX-specific hardware module called the "enclave page
cache" (EPC). The pages in the EPC differ from typical pages because of the
hardware restrictions: they are shared by processes at the hardware level
and there is one-to-one mapping between virtual and physical addresses
within an enclave. The enclaves also need specific SGX read,
write, and execute permissions to the EPC pages.</p>

<p>Without the needed LSM hooks, and with SGX active, the LSMs are unable
to apply policies with the granularity they need &mdash; they could deny
all access to SGX (by blocking access to <tt>/dev/sgx/enclave</tt>), but
could not control the mapping of pages as writable and executable, or
loading code from anonymous memory.  As the enclaves are backed by the same
file, any restrictions would apply to all enclaves.</p>

<p>The developers also found out that, because the SGX hardware bypasses
the standard page permissions, user space could use SGX to gain access it
could normally not have. The known case is the following: a hostile process
can add a read-only page backed by a file lacking execute permission to the
enclave, then call <tt>mprotect()</tt> to change the permissions in the
enclave to gain execute rights on that memory. A solution to the issue is
to require 
specifying enclave page protection in advance, allowing the kernel to apply
its policies regarding executable pages within enclaves.</p> 

<h4>Toward a solution</h4>

<p>

Sean Christopherson entered the discussion with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190531233159.30992-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com/">a
patch set</a> attempting to reconcile SGX with LSMs.
It included <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190531233159.30992-5-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com/">an
<tt>mprotect()</tt> hook</a> in the <tt>vm_ops</tt> structure meant to be
implemented by LSMs. The SGX code, when building an enclave,
would call that hook to oversee the permissions for each page.
This approach did not work, though, due to problems with auditing. The
developers
were unable to make sure that this hook would not generate false positives from
the checks made at enclave loading time. The other option was to do checks
at the 
time of <tt>mprotect()</tt>, but that could cause false alerts when the system
configuration changes. For example, alerts could result when a file is
moved between the loading of the enclave and the change of protection, or
when the LSM policy is modified.</p>

<p>The <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20190619222401.14942-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com">next
version</a> tracked the page
protection of the enclave separately from the virtual memory areas (VMAs)
mapping the source files and
from the hardware 
protections. The API requires user space to declare the protections of each
page when it is added by specifying a combination of the 
<tt>PROT_READ</tt>, <tt>PROT_WRITE</tt>, and <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt> flags. Those flags
define the maximal permissions that user space may request when mapping
the page. As a result, when a process tries to <tt>mmap()</tt> or
<tt>mprotect()</tt> on an enclave page, the call will fail if the
protections in the VMA would
be more permissive than the enclave page permissions. This tracking allows
the SGX code to call into LSMs when the enclave is being built. The LSMs can
then enforce their own policies on enclave pages.</p>

<p>During the discussion, Cedric Xing <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/cover.1561588012.git.cedric.xing@intel.com/">sent</a>
a different patch set addressing the same issue. He used a different 
method: tracking the correspondence between the enclave pages and their origin
(for example the files they were loaded from). That correspondence is kept
in the LSM data structures.</p>

<h4>The twist</h4>
<p>

<p>All the proposed solutions were complicated, hindering their acceptance.
A shift toward a consensus happened, though, when the developers came back to
the basic requirements. Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CALCETrXMAwHod_KZYPGWjTjg-fxOb1%3D02%3DQj2g1o624wOPfPZQ%40mail.gmail.com/">explained</a>
that the only real requirement for SGX LSM support is to not allow the
execution of arbitrary code, making the scope of the problem much simpler
than what had been considered before.  Jarkko Sakkinen, the original poster
of the SGX patches, <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20190705160549.tzsck5ho5kvtdhit@linux.intel.com/">proposed</a>
deferring the complexity of loading the enclaves to user space and,
in particular, splitting the roles of loading and running the enclaves.
Finally, Stephen Smalley <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/27e55a96-d5c4-69ed-a88d-7a3c26fb7f75@tycho.nsa.gov/">summarized</a>
an off-list discussion concluding that the solution only requires a
decision of the policies to be used by SELinux for SGX.



<p>Christopherson noted that there is <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20190708172930.GA20791@linux.intel.com/">still
some work to do</a>, but it can be done without affecting the SGX API,
after the new code is upstreamed. The code will <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/120cfcee-af82-83cd-fb73-a39ecddff2af@intel.com/">have
some drawbacks</a>, as Xing explained, such as the inability to support
self-modifying code in the enclaves.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>This discussion took over two months and touched the low-level details
of the kernel's memory-management and security primitives. The apparent
solution is much simpler than what was proposed in the discussion, even
though the exact details still need to be worked out. However, it seems that
the developers can now concentrate on the remaining SGX upstreaming
challenges.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As far as I know, with SMT on, SGX is almost completely broken.  With SMT off, I‚Äôm not sure.<br>
<p>
This applies equally to DRM and to more palatable use cases.<br>

The remote attestation quote covers whether SMT is on/off, so any sane client will refuse to talk to an enclave that is running on a host with SMT on.<br>
<p>
With SMT off, you've still got to be careful of spectre variants, though a bunch of micro-architectural state is flushed on enclave entry/exit, so it is a bit easier.<br>

What you're describing is literally DRM - an attempt to totally prevent the owner of a computer from examining what someone else's code running on it is doing. It's not going to work.<br>

I think you should consider a more nuanced definition of DRM. In the cloud case, one party is literally paying another to borrow their computer. In the U2F case, the owner is opting in to reducing their ability to leak their key.  Call them DRM if you like, but all of these use cases *add* value for the system‚Äôs owner and end user.<br>

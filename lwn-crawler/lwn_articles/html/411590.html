           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 27, 2010</br>
           </div>
The 2.6.36 kernel was released on October 20, and the 2.6.37 merge window
duly started shortly thereafter.  As of this writing, some 6450
changes have been merged for the next development cycle, with more surely
to come.  Some of the more significant, user-visible changes merged for
2.6.37 include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The first parts of the inode scalability patch set have been merged,
     but, as of this writing, the core locking changes have not yet been
     pushed for inclusion.  See <a href="/Articles/411929/">this
     article</a> for more information on the inode scalability work.
<p>
<li> The x86 architecture now uses separate stacks for interrupt handling
     when 8K stacks are in use.  The option to use 4K stacks has been
     removed. 
<p>
<li> The big kernel lock removal process continues; the core kernel is
     almost entirely BKL-free.  There is now a configuration option which
     may be used to build a kernel without the BKL.  File locking still
     requires the BKL, though; schemes are afoot to fix it before the
     close of the merge window, but this work is not yet complete.  If file
     locking can be cleaned up, it will be possible for many (or most)
     users to run a BKL-free 2.6.37 kernel.
<p>
<li> The "rados block device" has been added.  RBD allows the creation 
     of a special block device which is backed by objects stored in the
     Ceph distributed system.
<p>
<li> The GFS2 cluster filesystem is no longer marked "experimental."  GFS2
     has also gained support for the <tt>fallocate()</tt> system call.
<p>
<li> A new sysfs file, <tt>/sys/selinux/status</tt>, allows a user-space
     application to quickly notice when security policies have changed.
     The intended use is evidently daemons which cache the results of
     access-control decisions and need to know when those results might
     change.  A separate file, called <tt>policy</tt>, has been added for
     those simply wanting to read the current policy from the kernel.
<p>
<li> The scheduler now works harder to avoid migrating high-priority
     realtime tasks.  The
     scheduler also will no longer charge processor time used to handle
     interrupts to the process which happened to be running at the time.
<p>
<li> VMware's VMI paravirtualization support has been <a
     href="http://blogs.vmware.com/guestosguide/2009/09/vmi-retirement.html">deprecated
     by the company</a> and, as scheduled, removed from the 2.6.37 kernel. 
<p>
<li> Some hibernation improvements have been merged, including the ability
     to compress the hibernation image with LZO, 
<p>
<li> The ARM architecture has gained support for the <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332974/">seccomp</a> (secure computing)
     feature. 
<p>
<li> The block layer can now throttle I/O bandwidth to specific devices,
     controlled by the cgroup mechanism.  This is the second piece of the
     I/O bandwidth controller puzzle which allows the establishment of
     specific bandwidth limits which will be enforced even if more I/O
     bandwidth is available.
<p>
<li> The new "ttyprintk" device allows suitably-privileged user space to
     feed messages through the kernel by way of a pseudo TTY device.
<p>
<li> The kernel has gained support for the point-to-point tunneling
     protocol (PPTP); see <a href="http://accel-pptp.sourceforge.net/">the
     accel-pptp project page</a> for more information.
<p>
<li> The NFS <strike>server</strike> client has a new "idmapper" implementation for the translation
     between user and group names and IDs.  The new code is more flexible
     and performs better; see <a
     href="/Articles/411815/">Documentation/filesystems/nfs/idmapper.txt</a>
     for details.
<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>-olocal_lock=</tt> mount option for the NFS client
     which can cause it to treat either (or both) of <tt>flock()</tt> and
     POSIX locks as local.
<p>
<li> Most of the functions of the <tt>nfsservctl()</tt> system call have
     been deprecated and marked for removal in 2.6.40.  There is a new
     configuration option for those who would like to remove this
     functionality ahead of time.
<p>
<li> Simple support for the pNFS protocol has been merged.
<p>
<li> Huge pages can now be migrated between nodes like normal memory pages.
<P>
<li> There is the usual pile of new drivers:
     <p>

     <p>
     <li> The old ieee1394 stack has been removed, replaced at last by 
     	  the "firewire" drivers.

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/412072/">jump label</a>
     optimization mechanism has been merged; its initial purpose is to
     reduce the overhead of inactive tracepoints.
<p>
<li> Yet another RCU variant has been added: "tiny preempt RCU" is meant
     for uniprocessor systems.  "<q>This implementation uses but a
     single blocked-tasks list rather than the combinatorial number used
     per leaf rcu_node by TREE_PREEMPT_RCU, which reduces memory
     consumption and greatly simplifies processing.  This version also
     takes advantage of uniprocessor execution to accelerate grace periods
     in the case where there are no readers.</q>"
<p>
<li> New tracepoints have been added in the network device layer, places
     where <tt>sk_buff</tt> structures are freed, 
     <tt>softirq_raise()</tt>, workqueue operations, and
     memory management LRU list shrinking operations.
     There is also a new script for using perf to analyze network device
     events. 
<p>
<li> The wakeup latency tracer now has function graph support.  
<p>
<li> There is <a href="/Articles/411605/">a new mechanism</a> for running
     arbitrary code in hardware interrupt context.
<p>
<li> The power management layer now has a formal concept of "wakeup
     sources" which can bring the system out of a sleep state.  Among other
     things, it can collect statistics to help the user determine what is
     keeping a system awake.  Wakeup events can abort the freezing of
     tasks, reducing the time required to recover from an aborted suspend
     or hibernate operation.
<p>
<li> A new mechanism for managing the automatic suspending of idle devices
     has been added.
<P>
<li> There is a new set of functions for managing the "operating
     performance points" of system-on-chip components.  (<a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/e1f60b292ffd61151403327aa19ff7a1871820bd">commit</a>). 
<p>
<li> A long list of changes to the memblock (formerly LMB) low-level
     management code has been merged, and the x86 architecture now uses
     memblock for its early memory management.
<p>
<li> The default handling for <tt>lseek()</tt> has changed: if a driver
     does not provide its own <tt>llseek()</tt> function, the VFS layer
     will cause all attempts to change the file position to fail with an
     <tt>ESPIPE</tt> error.  All in-tree drivers which lacked
     <tt>llseek()</tt> functions have been changed to use
     <tt>noop_llseek()</tt>, which preserves the previous behavior.
<P>
<li> There is a new way to create workqueues:
     <p>
     <pre>
    struct workqueue_struct *alloc_ordered_workqueue(const char *name, 
                                                     unsigned int flags);
</pre>
     <p>
     Items submitted to the resulting workqueue will be run in order, one
     at a time.  It's meant to eventually replace the old singlethreaded
     workqueues. 
     <p>
     Also added is:
     <p>
     <pre>
    bool flush_work_sync(struct work_struct *work);
</pre>
     <p>
     This function will wait until a specific work item has completed.

<p>

<li> The ALSA ASoC API has been significantly extended to support sound
     cards with multiple codecs and DMA controllers.  (<a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/f0fba2ad1b6b53d5360125c41953b7afcd6deff0">commit</a>). 
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/356378/">stack-based
     <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt></a> patch has been merged, with an associated
     API change.  See the new <a
     href="/Articles/412065/">Documentation/vm/highmem.txt</a> file for
     details. 
<p>
<li> There are two new memory allocation helpers:
     <p>
     <pre>
    void *vzalloc(unsigned long size);
    void *vzalloc_node(unsigned long size, int node);
</pre>
     Both behave like the equivalent <tt>vmalloc()</tt> calls, but they
     also zero the allocated memory.
<p>
<li> Most of the work needed to <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/400541/">remove the concept of hard
     barriers</a> from the block layer has been merged.  This task will
     probably be completed before the closing of the merge window.
</ul>
<p>
Linus has let it be known that he expects this merge window to be shorter
than usual so that it can be closed before the 2010 Kernel Summit begins on
November&nbsp;1.  Expect patches to be merged at a high rate until the end
of October; an update next week will cover the changes merged in the last
part of the 2.6.37 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Because you don't need to run very complex stacks at all to exceed 4K. IIRC, NFS-served XFS can break the limit: it doesn't require much.<br>

Well, then they should fix the stacking happening at all, and make XFS and NFS less stack hungry, instead of pushing 8K stacks and pretending the problem doesn't exist. If there is a stack shortage then 8K might not be enough either. Or let XFS and NFS and others select 8K stacks.<br>
<p>
What I dislike is that they take away the 4K stack option altogether.<br>

      You want to see how much stack is being used in the kernel?<br>
<br>
Just run the stack_tracer (if enabled).<br>
<br>
<pre>
# mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/stack_trace_enabled
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_trace

<p>
I just about hit 4K immediately after enabling it. That first number is the stack depth (4064 bytes). That is 42 calls deep. This also shows the stack size of each function (the Size field).

Yeah, it was really libata that broke this camel's back. It pulls in the SCSI midlayer for virtually everything: a good idea, because this stuff really *is* SCSI-like, but it makes the call stacks a good bit deeper.<br>
<p>
(I stopped using 4kstacks a few years ago when I figured out that it was the cause of my hard lockups when running executables over NFS. That was pre-libata...)<br>

Well, I'd argue that a call stack of 42 is insane and should never happen, but who am I... In such cases any guarantees are off and it's time to actually detect and prevent stack shortage. And not with tracing and such, but a guard page or something.<br>

Uh, a guard page? That would make your 4K stack equivalent to 8K again, only you couldn't use half of it. Not so terribly useful, I think.<br>
<p>
Guard pages only make sense if the guarded data is generally much bigger than a page.<br>

Well, I mean reserving a guard page in the virtual address space, not allocating a physical page for it. It would cause a page fault, so I guess it can't work when interrupts are disabled, but the rest of the time it should work now interrupt handlers got their own stack. Except if I'm missing something.<br>

Hm, yeah, that would work, I think... kernel stacks are physically contiguous, but I don't see an obvious reason why they couldn't have a merely-virtually-contiguous unmapped guard page. (There probably is a reason, or they'd have done it.)<br>

Well, I'm pretty sure the kernel doesn't want a virtually mapped stack, so extending it could get a bit tricky. All in all it might be not worth the complexity compared to just using a 8kB stack.<br>
<p>
The main advantage of 4kB stack is not the saving of one page, but the added pressure of keeping bloat down. Things like 42 nested function calls are just not good to have.<br>
<p>
nevets, I think you could post that trace as a bug somewhere. :-/<br>

I thought that the big advantage of the 4K page was the ability to allocate a single page instead of needing to allocate a pair of pages (order 0 allocation instead of order 1 allocation), greatly reducing the problem of memory fragmentation.<br>

The chance that you can't allocate two contiguous pages is fairly small. we're talking about the stack page here, so it's one per task, which isn't much. Fragmentation is more a problem for bigger allocations than order 1,  for allocations that may not fail, and for very frequent allocations. The task stack is neither of those, so it's fine.<br>

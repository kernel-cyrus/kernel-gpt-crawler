At the conclusion of the 5.17 development cycle, 13,038 non-merge
changesets had found their way into the mainline repository.  That is a
lower level of activity than was seen for 5.16 (14,190 changesets) but well
above 5.15 (12,337).  In other words, this was a fairly typical kernel
release.  That is true in terms of where the work that made up the release
came from as well.
<p>
The changes in 5.17 were contributed by 1,900 developers, down from
the 1,988 seen in 5.16.  Of those developers, 268 made their first
kernel contributions in this cycle.  The most active developers this time
around were:

Christoph Hellwig continues to do extensive refactoring, mostly in the
block and filesystem layers; once again, this work has made him the top
changeset contributor.  Eric Dumazet, as always, has been busy making
the networking stack work better; he also added the <a
href="/Articles/877603/">reference-count tracking infrastructure</a> during
this cycle.  Mauro Carvalho Chehab does most of his work in the media
subsystem, Hans de Goede works mostly in the graphics layer (including
adding generic support for privacy screens this time around), and Andy
Shevchenko contributed numerous cleanups throughout the driver subsystem.
<p>
David Howells topped out the "lines changed" column by rewriting and
replacing the caching layer used by network filesystems.  Thierry Reding
contributed a lot of Tegra SoC hardware support, and Luiz Augusto von Dentz
worked extensively on the Bluetooth host-controller interface code.

the biggest change is the appearance of Andy Shevchenko, whose Reviewed-by

Once again, there are few surprises  here.
<p>

<h4>Old bugs?</h4>
<p>
While a development series like 5.17 brings a long list of new features, it
also includes fixes for older bugs.  There are various ways of calculating
just how old those bugs are, but one metric has the advantage of being
relatively easy to calculate: how many patches in 5.17 have been backported
to the stable updates for previous kernels?  The 4.19 kernel was released
in October 2018, for example, so any patches backported to the 4.19 stable
updates can be seen as being fixes for problems that are at least that old.
<p>
It's a fairly straightforward task to look at the mainline commit ID for
each commit in a stable series and see if it is a 5.17 commit or not.
Indeed, this can be done for older kernels as well; the results look like
this:
<p>

<p>
For each mainline/stable-update pair, the entries in the table show how
many patches were backported to the stable series from that mainline
release, and the percentage of all the patches in that stable series that
came from that mainline release.  Thus we see, for example, that
essentially all of the patches backported to 5.16 came from 5.17 — an
unsurprising observation.  (It is not 100% because there are always a few
patches that are not directly backported, or are just version tags).
<p>
Reading down the columns shows that, as time goes on, the number of bugs
fixed in the older stable updates does decrease, as one would expect.  But
it definitely does not drop to zero; patches were still being backported
from 5.17 to the 4.4 kernel (released over six years ago) right up until
that kernel stopped receiving support.  Reading across the columns suggests
that there is nothing special about 5.17; every mainline release is fixing
a steady stream of bugs that have been present for years.

<p>
Of course, there are any number of important caveats here.  For example,
backported patches could be fixing bugs in other backported patches, in
which case the bugs are more recent than it would seem.  As <a
href="/Articles/812231/">documented here</a> in the past, the regression
rate in stable kernels runs anywhere from about 3% to 12%, depending on how
one counts.  There is also the fact that not all backported
patches are bug fixes; some add device IDs or improve performance, for
example.
<p>
There are also fixes for hardware bugs.  For example, about 30 of the
just-backported 5.17 patches address the <a href="/Articles/887326/">branch
history injection</a> Spectre vulnerability.  It is not fair to chalk those
up as fixes for bugs in the older kernels, but they are problems that
needed to be fixed regardless.
<p>
These factors all suggest
that the above numbers could be adjusted but are not fundamentally wrong.
<p>

Overall, 5.17 was another typical, relatively boring kernel development
cycle.  The kernel-creation machine continues to crank out releases on a
predictable schedule.  As of this writing, linux-next contains over 12,800
changesets waiting to be dumped into the mainline for 5.18, so it does not
look like the process will stop anytime soon.
<p>
<h4>A postscript</h4>
<p>
Given the stability of the kernel's development process, these reports have
become increasingly uninteresting over time; there is not a lot of news to
be found here.  Given that, your editor is, once again, questioning the
value of producing them for every kernel release.  Increasingly, they seem
like a bunch of boilerplate with some side investigations tossed in to try
to make them more interesting.  Might it be more useful to discontinue
this practice in favor of, say, a full-year report on the occasion of
each long-term-stable release?  Please feel free to let us know, via the
comments or email to <tt>lwn@lwn.net</tt>, if you have an opinion on this
matter.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It is a lot of boilerplate, but I still like to peruse it to get a rough overview who is working on what. I guess I too would wonder whether it&#x27;s worth it, if I would be as deeply into the subject matter, but I am not and therefore I still find them nice to read every release.<br>

On the other hand, would you really want to fill a form with your age, gender, race, sexual preferences, (dis)abilities when submitting a patch?<br>
<p>
I know it would greatly put me off from contributing.<br>
<p>
In fact some UK university I was applying to was asking such things and I ended up not applying because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable that they thought it was ok to ask.<br>

This is a difference between countries. Here employers are strictly forbidden from asking/storing race/ethnicity/etc information about their employees (WW2 experience). Yet in the UK employers are apparently required to ask and store this information (for statistical purposes).<br>
<p>
I can sort of understand it, since how can you know if there is discrimination going on if you don&#x27;t record it. There are some health outcomes that depend on it, but as an employee it feels really weird when your employer asks for this kind of information since it&#x27;s not related to your work.<br>

But even in the UK you are free to refuse to provide it, and it should just go into the system as &quot;unknown&quot; - if an employer was caught using it to help to decide whether or not to hire you I&#x27;m sure there would be a heck of a lot of fallout.<br>
<p>
And this data should not be kept with your personnel record, but separated from it and anonymised. To the extent that employers really should re-survey their employees every year or two to see how the mix has drifted. They don&#x27;t (or rarely) bother, so they don&#x27;t have that information.<br>

I find these reports very personally interesting to keep tabs on how many people are providing the bulk of the (easily trackable) work that goes into each kernel release.  I also like to compare the stable fixes numbers for the overall kernel against the subsystem that I maintain.  That said, if time/money/$constraints are a problem, I would gladly trade larger reports less frequently for more in-depth reporting on other issues.<br>

I promise I am /not/ using this information to write me a new minivan. :P<br>

The statistics are not boring -  they provide great insight and details into the background story of the Linux kernel. The people who make it happen, the sheer work that goes into each release - these would perhaps not be as clear without a report such as this one.<br>

I definitely appreciate the work that goes in for getting these development statistics. <br>
I personally find these very interesting. Your employer&#x27;s stats also shows companies which are committed towards Linux open source upstream development. <br>
<p>
Having said that getting some insights at subsystem level too would be helpful. Like which  subsystems saw most amount of changes for a particular release (e.g. among different fs). Also to know the core developers working to improve different Linux subsystems is a valuable insight. <br>
Would you give it a try maybe for 5.18? ;)<br>

Long story short, while this information may be readily available if you know where to look (mailing lists, etc) - most people don&#x27;t know where to look and my anecdote above showed me that really no other mainstream media source is reporting on this information in an easily digestible format.<br>
<p>
For current and historical purposes I would also say there is value.<br>

One thing that would make it less boilerplate would be look at trends and note where things have changed over say a six month period, is a particular company being more active? If so, what areas are they active in and what triggered that change? <br>

There is certainly no shortage of opinions. What about an idea where the stats generation is more interactive with the LWN community? Maybe port the data processing scripts to a jupyter notebook and then putting it up on github so that anyone can crunch on the data and look for neat things.<br>

I like these, but I agree they’re a bit boilerplate - I’ve moved to skimming them looking for any of those side investigations John mentions, which I think perfectly reflects what John is talking about.<br>
<p>
Is there an option to do a short publication of the stats for those interested in it?  Or perhaps that’s just too barren to be of interest…<br>

I would say that these statistics are of interest yet they only provide a limited view on the kernel development and thus I fully understand why, dear editor, you believe they are boring. <br>
<p>
What about proposing articles that shortly present these information (you may give only the arrays and would only include a small explaination if really needed) + a focus on a subsystem or on a specific kernel arch/area. Who contributes to filesystems ? Which company focuses which subsystems? As we see in this report, Intel is again a top contributor. But how is their effort split? How many contributors do they have? and so on. <br>
<p>
I think that this would bring the novelty of information you are searching for :)<br>

The per-cycle stats are somewhat repetitive, longer trend analysis and zooming in on particular areas seems more interesting (the stable section is much more interesting than all the rest, maybe it&#x27;s just my obsession with stable.)<br>

I personally skip or maybe skim these articles.  I suspect anyone in the same boat as me may have missed the postscript and hence the question; hence you may have a rather biased sample.<br>

You may want to consider a reader survey at some point and add that as a question.<br>

I find them reasonably interesting, but you&#x27;re right about the boilerplate. Perhaps an annual round-up with a deeper dive into the occasional oddity? For example in this article you say<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; perhaps the biggest change is the appearance of Andy Shevchenko</font><br>
<p>
That&#x27;s cool - which area(s) is he reviewing, and why? Has the company he works for (if any) started some sort of more serious review initiative? Does he review code full-time? How many other people might do this? (I realise some of this may involve reaching out to people or companies who want to stay private, but of the people who want to talk, it could be interesting.)<br>

My employee uses these statistics as one of the additional metrics to get a sense if its upstream flow works as expected, both in planning and execution. The number of our patches is supposed to be steady and/or increasing at a sensible pace, any fluctuations warn us that something went wrong.<br>

These are definitely interesting. You could maybe feel better by making them more mechanical and less story-like. I get the desire to avoid writing the article with the exact same sentences as the previous one, but that&#x27;s inevitable, so you end up saying &quot;once again&quot;, &quot;as usual&quot;, &quot;still&quot; etc and feel bad about the repetition.<br>
<p>
Well that part is not necessary to write (and also not interesting to read). The article could really just be a form: here are the top blah, x did this, y did that. Here are the top bleh. There were x many this and y many that. No need for a preamble and conclusion for example.<br>
<p>
The extra analyses are cool though, and they could potentially continue to be a bit more story-like.<br>

I would definetely suggest adding a &#x27;menu bullit&#x27; for : development stats by kernel version<br>
and putting auto+generated versions there for the kernels (and possibly static - hand edited if necessary and then published)<br>
and then - when you feel there&#x27;s interesting stories (like who is this new developer - what is the company doing since he suddenly got time to do this, or other things) - and write those - with a reference to the developer stats for a specific kernel.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 27, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/951847/">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
A regular feature of the Kernel Maintainers Summit is a session where Linus
Torvalds discusses the problems that he has been encountering.  In recent
years, though, there have been relatively few of those problems, so this
year he turned things around a bit by <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/CAHk-=whGOUw=YDsPxd9o5M_JqcisE+TjcQQ-=SLYOnHd12D0Fw@mail.gmail.com/">asking
the community</a> what problems it was seeing instead.  He then addressed
them at the Summit in a session covering aspects of the development
community, including feedback to maintainers, diversity (or the
lack thereof), and more.
<p>
The first question he mentioned was a suggestion that, because he does test
builds after acting on pull requests, he is showing a distrust of his
maintainers.  These builds slowed the process down during the 6.7 merge
window, when Torvalds was traveling and doing the builds on a laptop.  He
answered that he normally does a build after each pull just as a part of
his normal workflow.  It is not a matter of not trusting maintainers —
though he does also like to verify that everything is OK.  He also does
builds to confirm any conflict resolutions he may have had to do.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/952157/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/LinusTorvalds2-sm.png" alt="[Linus Torvalds]"
title="Linus Torvalds" class="rthumb"></a>

Another question had to do with Torvalds's tendency to give mostly negative
feedback.  Maintainers quickly learn that, if Torvalds responds to a
pull-request email, it is usually bad news.  He acknowledged that he tends
to operate that way, and said that he is not proud of it.  In general, he
tries to avoid answering email if he doesn't have to.  So if a pull happens
without problems, he is happy and wants "to say 'I love you'", but he
doesn't act on that.  As a result, most of his emails are about problems.
He did not say that he would try to change that pattern.
<p>
The session was interrupted by a break at this point; on return, Torvalds
said that he is quite happy in general.  He was in Hawaii for the first
week of the merge window, which might ordinarily make things harder.  But
he got a lot of pull requests early and, despite the 6.7 merge window
bringing in the most commits of any merge window in the project's history,
it was "pain-free".  There was not a single case of a change breaking his
machine, which is rare.

</blockquote>
<p>
Another question to Torvalds mentioned that the maintainer tree is quite
flat, meaning that he pulls directly from a large number of trees rather
than from intermediate maintainers who coalesce pulls from multiple
subsystems.  He agreed that the tree is quite flat.  Sometimes that is by
his request; there have been cases where having code go through
intermediate maintainers has made things more complicated.  But the
flatness also, he said, suggests that some maintainers don't have the
support that they should and are solely responsible for getting work from
contributors into the mainline.  Some top-level maintainers do far too much
work, he said; they should find ways to delegate some of that work to
others.
<p>
There was, he said, a complaint that Thorsten Leemhuis, who has taken on
the task of tracking regressions, is pushing maintainers to get those
regressions fixed.  Torvalds found that surprising; he loves having
somebody staying on top of problems that way.  He can see that it can be
annoying to some maintainers, he said, but if Leemhuis weren't doing that
job, he would be doing it himself instead.
<p>
Another question had to do with the "bus factor" of having Torvalds in
charge of the whole community; what would happen if he were suddenly unable
or unwilling to do that work?  Torvalds said that things are working so
well in the kernel community that his disappearance would be "a momentary
distraction"; there would be "some infighting" as the new order was worked
out, then work would continue as always.  He said that maintainers should
talk to him, though, if they think he should be doing his work differently.
<p>
He noted that the kernel community as a whole has hit a
plateau in the last five years; the patch volume and number of developers
are not growing as they once did.  That may suggest, he said, that the
community has hit the limits of how far it can scale.  Adding more layers
of maintainers would help, he said, but it also would not solve all of the
issues that are impeding further growth.
<p>
<h4>Diversity</h4>
<p>
The last question to be addressed had to do with the gender imbalance in
the community and at the Maintainers Summit (which was 100% male)
specifically.  Torvalds agreed that the situation was not good and "not
going in the right direction", then quickly moved on.  Dan Williams
returned the discussion to this topic a bit later, noting that he had
recently had a discussion with the head of the <a
href="https://openjsf.org/">OpenJS Foundation</a>.  When she joined, she
was the only female member of the board; now it is much more balanced.  She
told Williams that the change was effected through direct outreach to
potential members; hoping that the problem would get better on its own was
not good enough.
<p>
Williams noted that the 2023 election for members of the Linux Foundation
Technical Advisory Board was uncontested; only the incumbents ran to keep
their seats.  That suggests, he said, that the community is missing chances
to reach out to people.  Torvalds said that Greg Kroah-Hartman used to do
that sort of outreach; Kroah-Hartman, in turn, said that Shuah Khan at the
Linux foundation is doing a good job of bringing in interns.  The problem
is that, after learning how to do kernel development, they disappear into
companies and are never seen again.
<p>
Williams said that he went to a recent <a
href="https://blackistechconference.com/">Black Is Tech conference</a>,
which featured a slate of all black developers.  This would have been a
good event for outreach, but nobody was there to recruit for Linux.
Torvalds said that the maintainers in the room were not the best people to
be doing outreach.  Kroah-Hartman again mentioned programs like Outreachy
and the Google Summer of Code, which do well at reaching out to potential
developers, but which mostly end up providing employees that disappear into
companies.  Dave Airlie said that he has been able to get a couple of
Outreachy interns working on graphics into community-oriented jobs, and
they are still contributing.
<p>
Steve Rostedt said that one problem has to do with the demands on women who
are successful in the kernel community; they are quickly "asked to join
everything" and it burns them out.  Ted Ts'o suggested thinking about the
different points in the pipeline; people invited to join panels tend to be
mid-level developers, but people are dropping out at all levels, suggesting
that there is a wider problem.  Developers at different levels have
different needs, he said.  Josef Bacik agreed that the community relies too
heavily on the few women that it has; he cited one developer who got burned
out and now prefers to just focus on one area and avoids the community.
<p>
Thomas Gleixner pointed to one end of the pipeline by saying that there are
few women in computer-science programs; Airlie said that is true of
undergraduate programs, but there are more women doing postgraduate work.
Christoph Hellwig says that he sees more women at academic events than at
community events.
<p>
Bacik said that he does a lot of recruiting for his employer; he goes to
events like the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/">Grace Hopper
Celebration</a> as a way of finding good candidates.  The Linux Foundation,
he said, could send people to events like this to let developers know that
the Linux community exists.
<p>
Konstantin Ryabitsev said that there are good reasons why developers
disappear into companies.  It is often the only path available; the Linux
Foundation is unable to hire them (it employs few developers in general).
Not everybody is able to sacrifice their evenings and weekends to do
community work, he said.  Hellwig suggested looking harder outside of the
US and Europe; there are far more women in engineering elsewhere.
Discussion on this topic ended with a suggestion from Ts'o to survey
Outreachy interns a couple of years after they complete the program and see
if they are still working in tech.  If not, it would be good to know why;
for now, he said, we are only guessing.
<p>
With that, the session (and the Maintainers Summit as a whole) came to an
end; the attendees filed off for the obligatory <a
href="/Articles/951851/">group photo</a> before taking some much-needed
rest.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This context really should be central when talking about diversity drives, you can’t recruit from a pool that’s 90% group X, 10% group Y and expect to get an even ratio without severely skewing the recruiting process. This is a systemic issue in society, which is not caused by and cannot be fixed by the organisation of Linux’s maintainer corps — a group which, as LWN coverage reflects, is made up of volunteers who do a lot of gruelling work for very little material benefit. The extreme gender imbalance is a symptom, not a cause, and it will need to be cured elsewhere.<br>

Of course, the appeal of this argument was never in it being correct in the first place, but in it's ability to absolve the person making it of responsibility.<br>

You can easily look up the gender disparity in computing undergraduates and see that the gender imbalance is around 4:1, so there clearly is a real 'pipeline problem' and I suppose that's why this page has to resort to all sorts of weird tangential gotchas to deny its existence. But it's probably pointless to argue with you given you've immediately accused me of making the whole thing up out of malice; any conversation on that basis is going to be extremely toxic.<br>

If you carefully calculate the ratio for this event, you might determine it is somewhat worse than 1:4. It is also worse than the approximately 1:10 found among people actively working in the tech industry at large. There also seem to be projects that reach numbers far above this without much real effort beyond maintaining a welcoming environment.<br>
<p>
This suggests there may perhaps be things one could do besides throwing up your hands and declaring there's nothing to do. If that is desired, of course.<br>

Well I might look back at literally the last article LWN published, called "Reducing kernel-maintainer burnout", and posit that it has something to do with underrepresented groups entering a field tending not to filter into a notoriously thankless and demanding role, particularly when, as the article notes, outreach efforts for those groups are full of large companies looking to get their diversity numbers up who can offer actual salaries.<br>

That's an interesting conjecture. I'm not sure it quite checks out, considering the ratios for linux contributors are also bad by FOSS standards and most maintainers are in fact being employed by those tech companies supposedly desperately pushing up their numbers.<br>
<p>
But given that we've now at least progressed from vague handwringing about pipelines to at least talking about concrete reasons that women might in fact be deliberately avoiding the linux community today, I think I'll leave things here.<br>

Not sure I'd go that far. You did just come back with the first deflection that popped into your head, one which makes absolutely no sense if one thinks about it for more than a few seconds. But at least it was a new bad argument.<br>

What a load of bullshit.<br>
<p>
It is actual fact that some domains have predominantly attracted subcategories of populations. Starting from then, assuming everyone *is* equal, that ratio should trickle down to other domains down the line. <br>
<p>
So yeah, telling little girls CS is not for them because of social constructs is not something people should do because, that too, is a load of bullshit. But good news, at least where I live people don't do that. We're not in the 60s anymore and it would be nice if people making decisions were not stuck there assuming that's how the world is.<br>
<p>
The 50-50 enforcement already creates a lot of backlash in companies: in mine, the sentiment women are more incompetent than men went from non-existent 10 years ago to widely shared. Why is that? We went from 30-70 to almost 50-50 in my department and the push was so big if a woman was applying she would get hired. That's not how you get competent people. And unfortunately because those people are systematically women, some of my colleagues just stop at the correlation. So now you create a generation of people who will avoid hiring women if they want to get things done, congrats!<br>

Funny enough, my understanding is that in the 60's, females were *vastly* more prevalent in "computing" jobs. Society wrecked it when computers became commodity and were classified as "for boys" and there have been shared experiences of university class professors *assuming* that one has tinkered with them in intro classes instead of…doing their job and teaching the basics.<br>
<p>
These feminine/masculine classifications of things are *strong*. I was repeatedly asked what I'd do with my childhood cars, planes, etc. if I had a daughter. My response was that if she wants to play with them, so be it. If she doesn't, so be it. Same as for a son. I find it silly that we've done things like "dinosaurs and trucks are for boys; candy and unicorns are for girls". I find that this is definitely a product of commercialization. For example, dresses used to be "for children", but this changed somewhere in the 40's and 50's. Here's a photo of Teddy Roosevelt as a child: &lt;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/auZJ1rv.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/auZJ1rv.jpg</a>&gt;.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; you can’t recruit from a pool that’s 90% group X, 10% group Y and expect to get an even ratio without severely skewing the recruiting process</span><br>
<p>
I don't think anybody's expecting an even ratio in those conditions. But if your pool were say 80-20, your community say 95-5, and other organisations recruiting from the same pool more like say 90-10, then surely it would be worth thinking about it?<br>
<p>
I agree about the issue being systemic, but the thing about social systems is they're pervasive. Most complex issues don't conveniently boil down to a single cause that would be neatly in a given community XOR in the rest of the world. Most likely there are multiple causes both inside and outside any given community.<br>
<p>
No community can fix all of the world's issues on its own, but every community can try do to its part.<br>

Yes, absolutely, and there's always a real danger of waving real problems away and saying 'it's not our fault'. But there's also a real danger of pretending you're responsible for everything and making your supposed guilt into a self-important performance, and avoiding both requires a grounded understanding of the context you're operating in and the effect your actions have, not blind ideology. It's not like there's some simple solution kernel leadership could apply if they only cared; the article clearly documents things they've been trying.<br>

I don't understand why this is such a large concern. At its best, a person or organisation consciously changing their policy or methods makes a positive change and makes it easier and more acceptable for everyone else to try to raise standards. At worst they will fail to live up to their self-declared standards but talking about it still raises awareness and makes it easier and more acceptable for everyone else to improve. Yes we all hate hypocrites, which they would be, but what's the big harm here? If lots of people do it they may not be as hypocritical?<br>
<p>
You might say we have to make sure we identify and act on the real causes here but that's true of all complex systemic problems: different people will disagree on the real root causes and thus try to fix those root causes differently. When someone tries to solve the "wrong" root cause in other complicated problems, we don't tend to wring our hands over whether their attempt is wholly or even partly performative, we just think it's misguided. It seems to me that the problem is not actually other people, the problem is us and that we tend to feel morally judged when they talk about how they are trying to be better.<br>

      <p>There's also a known pattern across multiple fields (first identified in the context of accessibility) where identifying and fixing issues that drive away a group completely is also a route to making life better for the people who aren't driven away by the problems. Or, to put it slightly differently, we all have different tolerances for different types of bad behaviour; a significant chunk of fixing an imbalance is simply making sure that bad behaviour that the desired group will not tolerate (but that the existing group will tolerate even though they dislike it) is removed from your community.
<p>This doesn't mean that you shouldn't call out cases where a "diversity" effort is making things worse; it does mean that you need to consider whether a given effort is neutral (aims to attract an under-represented group, doesn't change the community dynamics otherwise), good even if it fails (aims to attract an under-represented group, removes a negative community dynamic), or bad unless it succeeds (aims to attract an under-represented group, adds a new negative community dynamic) before objecting in principle. After all, if the long-term effect of trying to make the kernel maintainer crowd more diverse is to make Linus, Greg, Dave, Paul, Marcel, William, Thomas, Vinod, Christian, Hannes, Takashi, Peter and all the other existing maintainers happier and more productive, what's the problem with that outcome?

What you need to bear in mind, though, is if your pool is 90/10, that 10 is probably better than the top of the 90. So even if you only manage to recruit 88/12, your worst minority guy is probably way above the average of your hires. In all likelihood the worst minority applicant is better than the average of your hires.<br>

"A woman has to be twice as good, to be considered even half as good". If they've fought their way that far, chances are they're worth it. If they don't shoot themselves in the foot with "well their attitude won't go down well with the team", then hire them!<br>

That's assuming there is so much impedance that the people who stick with it must be extremely good to compensate.<br>
<p>
The problem is that no data suggests that. The law of "the strongest survives" does not apply just because it so happens you found a way to categorise a group that makes one group tiny. Look at the group of ginger people, which used to be shunned and even burnt in some places in different times. They've had it very hard. Does that make them better programmers? I'm afraid not.<br>
<p>
In my experience, males are no better nor worse that females, as groups, at hiring time. There are very good ones and very bad ones in both. As for the ratio of each, I'd say it's the same. <br>

And what you say is exactly what ou head of department said to justify going from 30-70 to 50-50. When hiring, if a woman applied (whose application didn't look as done by mistake), we would hire her.<br>
<p>
In 10 years, we went from people being very supportive, almost to a patronizing level, of women who came in the department (because most my colleagues wanted them to feel good there and stay!) to people telling me in the corridor things like "oh please don't fuck it up for: get a competent guy, we really someone who can do the job".<br>
<p>
And why is that? Sexism? Nope: what they want me to do is to find a person that is competent, whatever they have between their legs, but they've seen so many incompetent women (not because they are women but because we tapped into that 10% with the same naivety you showed) that they *now* make a (spurious) correlation.<br>

Don't assume "random" groups are better because they are underrepresented.<br>

As I put it, we need "positive anti-discrimination". What you describe seems clear positive discrimination - "hire them because they're a woman".<br>
<p>
Positive anti-discrimination, as far as I'm concerned, means "Are they competent? If so, bias in their favour".<br>
<p>
My mum gave a classic example of how women are discriminated against :-( When she retired, her job was split in two "because it's too much for one person", and the two - MEN - who replaced her were both hired at a higher salary than her leaving salary.<br>
<p>
Thing is, once you acknowledge a problem, you can (try to) deal with it. We know the problem, we know certain "fixes" backfire. Let's try and find one that really works. Sadly, from what I know of history, we fix it, but fail to learn from it, and then a generation or two later we have to fix it again ...<br>
<p>

In Norway I worked on a project in a bank. A manager there quite a few times mentioned about a pressure from the upper management to hire more female developers. But he cannot find them. The only woman on the whole team was an immigrant from China. Yet among management in the bank women were very represented, at least one third at the middle management.<br>
<p>
Then the bank outsourced quite a few things to an Indian firm. Like 50% of developers from India were female. But anybody with any position of power like team leads were men. I talked to few Indian women. They said the reason they got into IT was money. They simply had no other choices out of poverty.<br>
<p>
After that experience honestly I do not see how one can reach any other conclusion than the fact that when women have real choices, their choice is not IT, but, for example, to become a manager or a lawyer, the profession dominated by women in Norway these days and that may even pay better than IT.<br>

I think it's a huge and unjustified leap to conclude that women have an absolute preference for being lawyers over being programmers, but the fact that India has a higher proportion of women in tech (roughly 35% against 25% in the US) does indicate that pressures in the national employment environment have a huge impact. I really can't believe that the average Indian tech workplace is a lot more welcoming for women than the average American one, despite the importance placed on that in diversity narratives.<br>

Based on the stories told to me by Indian colleagues over the years, I suspect it's less "more welcoming to women" and more "equally crappy/demanding of everyone"<br>

How many women in India work in IT in management positions? And if the answer is not 35% but much smaller percent, then India statistics cannot be used to backup the claim that the diversity problem can be solved.<br>
<p>
Again, lawyers in Norway are good example when diversity happens naturally as long as women are given a chance. 70 years ago lawyers here were prestigious male-only profession. Then when society finally acknowledged that woman must have the same opportunities the situation started to change. Now over halve of lawers are female. Moreover, in cases like family lawyers there is an opposite problem, too few man.<br>
<p>
Yet in IT or few other sectors like pilots very little has changed despite explicit efforts by the government to change the situation. Is IT or being a pilot in Norway, a country with very powerful feminist movement, is so much more toxic for women than being a lawyer?<br>
<p>
I am not saying that the problem of discrimination or toxic environment for women is solved in Norway. It is not. But the fact remains that despite best efforts women do not want to join IT or few other professions. And given that I think it is time to acknowledge that outreach or similar programs are not going to solve the diversity problem. The efforts should be spend to fix other issues like better pay for maternity leave, encouraging man to spent more time with their children etc. But that has nothing to do with Linux kernel development.<br>

IT has its own issues, in which I do think toxic attitudes - both sexist ones and just general toxicity that leaches into everything and affects men too, but possibly disproportionately affects women - play a significant part.<br>
<p>
For being a pilot, I can see there being work-life balance issues that could mean the job is intrinsically less attractive to women. Being a pilot involves regularly being away from home. This is likely less attractive for women once they (want to) have kids. <br>
<p>
Historically, there are other physiological factors which could be argued to very slightly bias piloting towards males. Though, not an issue in even semi-modern planes. Then there is the extant, heavy male bias in piloting, which is rooted in most of the civilian pilot pool having come from military flying in earlier days, which would have affected culture *cough* - which took a long time to change.<br>

This year's Nobel Memorial Prize in economics was awarded to Claudia Goldin who talked about "Greedy Jobs". A "Greedy Job" is one that takes priority over everything else. Being the primary care-giver for children is a "Greedy Job". Senior positions are often "Greedy Jobs". But you can only hold one "Greedy Job". So being the primary care giver and holding a senior job are mutually exclusive.<br>

That may be so, but I am willing to bet women remain the primary carers, in the majority of families. (For whatever definition of "primary" sufficient to explain that such a carer would not wish to have a job that regularly being away from the children).<br>
<p>
I'm not here to say that women /should/ be the primary carers, just that - for whatever reasons (which for some may be that it is their preference) - in majority of cases, even in modern societies with strong social support for women and families with children, they are.<br>

      <p>The devil is in the detail, though; what is the pay rate during parental leave in your country?
<p>Mine says that fathers get to take parental leave at the equivalent pay rate of 15 hours minimum wage per week, while women get 6 weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and the rest of their parental leave at 15 hours minimum wage per week (or 90% of their average weekly earnings if lower). With pre-existing gender disparities in pay, this works out as a bigger hit to household budgets if men take the parental leave than if women take it. And while the law says that men and women must be paid the same rate for the same work, there's very little enforcement of this unless people in the same job share their pay information with each other; as a result, companies do things like employ men as "warehouse associates" and women as "warehouse assistants", where associates are technically asked to do more, and are paid more as a result, but where the jobs are close enough to qualify as the same for the purposes of equality laws.
<p>On top of that, medical advice is that you should aim to exclusively breastfeed a baby until they are 28 weeks old, with feeds at 28 weeks old being every 2 to 4 hours during the working day.  For most families, this is incompatible with mother returning to work before then, and results in women doing things like pumping milk and hoping that they can leave enough for their baby at home, if they go back to work at all - while facing parental guilt for putting their job before their baby.
<p>This all militates against women returning to work when their baby is young; and with "greedy jobs" (a lovely term that I'll remember, so thanks <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/953030/">pwfxq for introducing it to this discussion</a>) demanding that you dedicate your time to work, it pushes women out of that part of the workforce.

Likewise doctors in the UK. The complaint now is a lack of male GPs (although a lot of other roles are still heavily male dominated).

A common pain point to women in their career is the lack of understanding, process and coping mechanisms when giving birth and raising children, a task that is more often than not landing with women, and is one of the general factors that contribute to their lack of career movement around this age, also thought to contribute significantly to their lower salaries because they are not in the right time and place when career is supposed to happen.<br>
<p>
A key value that companies that recruit women stress is that they offer good part-time opportunities and parental leave terms. (For example startups that expect you to work 24/7 and sleep under your desk does not look very appealing in this aspect, whereas big corporations where people are redundant and replaceable often will.)<br>
<p>
Our community expectations of people being available pretty much always (or at least such is the behaviour of some of us) isn't a good fit for family time planning.<br>
<p>
The kernel co-maintainer and group maintainership models work better with this, and it something we should try to emphasize, so that female and male contributors alike are empowered to scale their community engagement up and down as family life permits.<br>

Do people really expect that?  It is completely unreasonable for anyone.<br>
I personally delight in the fact that my timezone (UTC+11) is incompatible with most of the world so I never need to feel any urgency to reply - any reply is unlikely to be read before I finish work for the day.<br>
<p>
But I've never had anyone give any hint of complaint that I didn't respond sooner.<br>

<p>
Yes people do expect it, and yes it is unreasonable. It's a symptom of the "me me me" culture that seems so prevalent nowadays. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, as mentioned elsewhere, when so often stuff gets ignored people tend to demand attention - "the squeaky wheel gets the most oil".<br>
<p>
It's a hard problem to solve.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Discussion on this topic ended with a suggestion from Ts'o to survey Outreachy interns a couple of years after they complete the program and see if they are still working in tech.</span><br>
<p>
I've had the same thought about programs like Outreachy for several years now: without hard data to evaluate the effectiveness, and, if effectiveness turns out to be low, the reasons behind it, we're effectively blind. Science favours double-blind studies, but not blind research.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; The problem is that, after learning how to do kernel development, they disappear into companies and are never seen again.</span><br>
<p>
If numbers back this statement, we need to know what the interns do inside those companies. Do they still work on the kernel, but without being given enough time to contribute upstream ? It's tempting to believe so, given how the same issue seems to also cause burn-out in the community.<br>

My gut feeling is that demand for actual kernel development is relatively low compared to demand for the advanced systems programming skills involved in kernel development, so there's a real risk that these programmes may be effectively operating as pro-bono training donated by kernel devs to tech giants.<br>

FWIW I tend to agree with this, although I think the reason they "disappear" isn't related to the individual so much as the decoupled nature of mainlining something versus getting something into good enough shape to ship for a product -- the former taking a lot more time and effort than a marketing-driven schedule would nominally allow.  And "what's in it for us to make upstream better?" is still a _very_ common attitude amongst those controlling budgets/salaries.<br>
<p>
Perhaps another way of expressing this distinction is one of being _sponsored_ by $company to work on the kernel, as opposed to working _for_ $company on (specific) kernel-related tasks.<br>

      <p>There are plenty of people who may organize a kernel release and do all that technical work that Linus does.</p>

<p>The <b>real</b> role Linus plays is social, not technical: he catches things that may become a problem for kernel development year or five years down the road… and that's not something you may easily teach and, worse, it's not something you may check if someone knows how to do.</p>

Men and women use language differently. There's almost certainly other subtle clues. Like all things, it's not perfect, but anybody who studies the subject (and probably a fair few who don't) would achieve a result well outside the bounds of "good luck".<br>

You might be right, but I think, we can agree that nobody says data, everyone pronounces it data.<br>

Italians certainly don't pronounce it the english way, in general.<br>
<p>
For example italians usually pronounce C++ with the C in italian and the ++ in english, for some reason. I've also heard HDMI pronounced mixed italian-english.<br>

There has been plenty written by women on this topic. We don't have to agree with it just because it's said by women. It's an issue that affects everyone, and everyone is entitled to their say. <br>

All maintainers give mostly negative feedback, it's not just Linus.  I always explain to non-technical people that my job is to send emails all day long to people complaining about their work and pointing out mistakes.  I do tend to thank people if they redo a patch because redoing patches is horrible.<br>
<p>
We had one person who used to give positive feedback and it was kind of annoying.  The wordiness was unnecessary.<br>
<p>
One strategy for thanking people is to do it randomly.  People are always working hard so they always kind of deserve to be thanked.  But if you thank them all the time then it becomes noise they ignore.  But if it's a surprise thankfulness they think maybe they did something extra special.  (This is a life hack).<br>

And a city administration office in charge of issuing/rejecting applications for whatever permit wouldn't be all that different, now would it?<br>

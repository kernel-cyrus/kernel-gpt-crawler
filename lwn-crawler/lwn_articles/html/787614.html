Control groups are a useful mechanism for managing resource usage in the
system, but what happens when the control groups themselves become a
resource problem?  In a plenary session at the 2019 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Roman Gushchin described problems
he has been facing with deleted control groups that take their time before
actually going away.  Some of these problems have been fixed, but the issue
has not been truly resolved.

<p>
Control groups are managed using a virtual filesystem; a particular group
can be deleted just by removing the directory that represents it.  But the
truth of the matter, Gushchin said, is that while removing a control
group's directory 
hides the group from user space, that group continues to exist in the
kernel until all references to it go away.  While it persists, it continues
to consume resources.
<p>
The problem is especially acute for memory control groups, where every page
that is charged to the group holds a reference to it.  So a given control
group cannot be truly deleted until every page that was charged to it is
reclaimed, which can take a long time; if some of those pages are still

<a href="/Articles/787622/"><img

actively used, they may avoid reclaim indefinitely.  In addition, various
bugs have also had the effect of keeping deleted groups around.  It all
adds up to deleted control groups hanging around and haunting the system;
he found 1,500 of them after a week of operation.

<p>
The consequences of this problem are not huge, but still "not nice", he
said.  Each control group consumes about 200KB of memory while it exists,
which begins to add up when thousands of them are waiting to die.  All of
those groups serve to 
increase the complexity (and the cost) of traversing the control-group
hierarchy in the kernel.  That memory use can also throw off memory-management
accounting.
<p>
Some of the reasons for the persistence of removed control groups  are
easier to deal 
with than others.  There was, for example, a rounding error in the handling
of user pages that caused the final page not to be reclaimed.  This bug
showed up in both versions of the control-group subsystem; it has since been
fixed.  Another issue had to do with the accounting of kernel stacks;
it was introduced in the switch to <a href="/Articles/692208/">virtually
mapped stacks</a> in 2016.  These stacks were charged to the process (and
its group) that first allocated them; when a stack was reused for a new
process, the charging was not updated.  This problem, too, has been fixed.
<p>
A problem that is not yet fixed has to do with kernel memory obtained from
the slab allocators.  Many cached objects, such as dentry structures, are
obtained from the slab allocator and charged to the appropriate control
group; they, too, must be cleaned up before that group can be truly
deleted.  But when there is not a lot of memory pressure, the shrinkers do
not run aggressively and those objects can persist for a long time.
Gushchin tried a patch to apply some extra pressure, but it caused
performance regressions in the XFS filesystem and was subsequently
reverted.  So now he is working on a different approach: reparenting slab
caches on control-group removal.  There is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190423213133.3551969-1-guro%40fb.com/">a patch
set</a> in review, so hopefully this problem will be resolved in the near
future.
<p>
With those fixes, the problems that he has observed have been addressed,
but there are other potential problems out there.  Pages obtained with
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> and per-CPU pages are one possible trouble area.  In
general, though, he said that it is easy to create hidden references to
control groups that can impede their removal; this is an area where
regressions are likely to happen.
<p>
At the end of the session, Michal Hocko said that the part of the problem
is simply the size of structure used to represent a memory control group.
Perhaps things could be made a little better by splitting that structure in
two and only keeping the core parts when the group is removed.  But
Johannes Weiner replied that memory pressure is the only thing that is
trimming back these deleted groups now; if they are made smaller, they will
just pile up more deeply.  So, while some manifestations of this problem
have been dealt with, the issue of dying control groups will, like the
groups themselves, be with us for some time yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

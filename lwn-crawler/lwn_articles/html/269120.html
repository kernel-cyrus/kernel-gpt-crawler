           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 13, 2008</br>
           </div>
The kernel development process operates at a furious pace, merging
on the order of 10,000 changesets over the course of a 2-3&nbsp;month
release cycle.  There have been many changes over the last few years which
have helped to make this level of patch flow possible, and the process has
been optimized significantly.  An ongoing discussion on the kernel mailing
list has made it clear, though, that a truly optimal solution has not yet
been found.
<p>

It started with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/268881/">the announcement
of the linux-next tree</a>.  This tree, to be maintained by Stephen
Rothwell, is intended to be a gathering point for the patches which are
planned to be merged in the next development cycle.  So, since we are
currently in the 2.6.25 cycle, linux-next will accumulate patches for
2.6.26.  The idea is to solve the patch integration issues there and reduce
the demands on Andrew Morton's time.
<p>

The question which was immediately raised was this: how do we deal with big
API changes which require changes in multiple subsystems?  These changes
are already problematic, often requiring maintainers to rework their trees
in the middle of the merge window.  Trying to integrate such changes
earlier, in a separate tree, could bring a new set of problems.  There will
be a lot of conflicts between patches done before and after the API change,
and somebody is going to have to put the pieces back together again.
Andrew does some of that now, but the problem is big enough that not even
Andrew can solve it all the time.  The bidirectional SCSI patches merged
for 2.6.25 were <a href="/Articles/269175/">held up as an example</a>; that
change required coordinated SCSI and block layer patches, and it never was
possible to get the whole thing working in -mm.
<p>

Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/269182/">asserted</a> that the only way
to make large API changes work is to merge them first, at the beginning of
the merge window.  The merged patch would fix all in-tree users of the
changed API, as is
the usual rule.  Maintainers of all other trees could then merge with the
updated mainline, fixing any new code which might be affected by the API
change.  This is, essentially, the approach which was taken for the big
device model changes in 2.6.25; they hit the mainline at the beginning of
the merge window, then everybody else got to adapt to the new way of doing
things.
<p>

Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/269187/">worries that this approach
is not sufficient</a>, especially when live trees are being merged.  If an
API change in one tree forces a change to a separate tree, the coordination
issues just get hard.  Keeping the secondary changes in the primary tree
risks conflicts with patches in the proper subsystem tree.  Patches which
reach across trees are also, increasingly, being discouraged as making life
harder for everybody.  But the fixup patch will not apply to its nominal subsystem
tree as long as the API change itself is not there.  In the -mm tree, this
sort of problem is glued together by a series of fixup patches maintained
by Andrew; Greg says that the linux-next tree would need something similar.
<p>

David Miller's <a href="/Articles/269201/">suggestion</a> was to resolve
this sort of conflict through frequent rebasing of the -next tree.
Rebasing is an operation (supported by git and other code management tools)
which takes a set of patches against one tree and does what's required to
make them apply to a different version of the tree.  It can be quite useful
for maintaining patches against a moving target - which kernel trees tend
to be.  David talked about how he rebases his (networking subsystem) trees
frequently as a way of eliminating conflicts with the mainline and, in the
process, cleaning some cruft out of the development history.
<p>

It turns out, though, that this frequent rebasing is not popular with the
developers who are downstream of David.  Rebasing the tree forces all
downstream contributors to do the same thing, and to deal with any merge
conflicts that result.  It makes it much harder to prepare trees which can
be pulled upstream and creates extra work.
<p>

This was where Linus <a href="/Articles/269208/">jumped into the
conversation</a> and expressed his dislike of rebasing.  He echoed the
complaints from downstream developers that a constantly-rebased tree is
hard to prepare patches against.  It also confuses the development history,
making changes to other developers' patches in silent ways.  After
somebody's patch set has been rebased, it is no longer the patches that
were sent.  So, <a href="/Articles/269210/">says Linus</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So there's a real reason why we strive to *not* rewrite
	history. Rewriting history silently turns tested code into totally
	untested code, with absolutely no indication left to say that it
	now is untested.
</div>
<p>
It is about here that Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/269212/">commented</a> that git does not appear to be
matching entirely well with the way that kernel developers work.  Some of
the solution may be found in tools more oriented toward the management of
patch queues - such as quilt.  There may be a renewed push to get more
quilt-like functionality built into git (along the lines of the <a
href="http://procode.org/stgit/">stacked git</a> project) in the near
future.
<p>

Linus is also <a href="/Articles/269214/">not entirely pleased</a> with how
the integration of patches only happens in the mainline:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm also a bit unhappy about the fact you think all merging has to
   	go through my tree and has to be visible during the two-week merge
   	period. Quite frankly, I think that you guys could - and should -
   	just try to sort API changes out more actively against each other,
   	and if you can't, then that's a problem too.
</div>
<p>
His suggestion is that a separate git tree should be created to contain a
large API change - and nothing else.  Affected subsystem maintainers could
then merge that tree and develop against the result.  In the end, all of
the pieces should merge nicely in the mainline.
<p>
This approach raises a number of interesting issues.  The API-change tree
has to be agreed upon by everybody, and it must be quite stable - lots of
changes at that level will create downstream trouble.  There must also be a
high degree of confidence that this API-change tree will, in fact, get
merged into the mainline; should Linus balk, everybody else's trees will no
longer be applicable to the mainline.  Replacing the current "tree of
trees" patch flow with something messier could create a number of
coordination issues.  And there are fears that a mainline tree built from
this process would fail to build in many of its intermediate states, which
would make tools like "git bisect" much harder to use.  Even so, it could
be part of the long-term solution.
<p>

Linus also took the opportunity to complain about large-scale API changes
in general:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Really. I do agree that we need to fix up bad designs, but I
   	disagree violently with the notion that this should be seen as some
   	ongoing thing. The API churn should absolutely *not* be seen as a
   	constant pain, and if it is (and it clearly is) then I think the
   	people involved should start off not by asking "how can we
   	synchronize", but looking a bit deeper and saying "what are we
   	doing wrong?"
</div>
<p>
He also <a href="/Articles/269219/">stated</a> that the costs of big API
changes are high enough that we should, more often, stay with older
interfaces, even if they are not as good as they could be.  Others <a
href="/Articles/269220/">disagreed</a>, claiming that Linux must continue
to evolve if it is to stay alive and relevant.  
<p>

The rate of change seems unlikely to fall in the near future.  There may be
some changes to how big changes are done, though.  As <a
href="/Articles/269222/">suggested</a> by Ted Ts'o, more changes could be
done by creating entirely new interfaces rather than breaking old ones.
With Ted's scheme, the old interface would be marked "deprecated" at the
beginning of the merge window.  Developers would then have the entire
development cycle to adjust to the change, and the deprecated interface
would be removed before the final release.
<p>

There is resistance to this approach, based on the observation that getting
rid of deprecated interfaces tends to be harder than one would expect.
But, still, it is a relatively painless way of making changes.  The current
transition (in the memory management area) from the <tt>nopage()</tt> VMA
operation to <tt>fault()</tt> is an example of how it can work.  Nick
Piggin has been slowly changing in-tree users with the eventual goal of
removing <tt>nopage()</tt> altogether.  For now, though, both interfaces
coexist in the tree and nothing has been broken.
<p>

Like the kernel itself, its development process is undergoing constant
change and (hopefully) improvement.  As the development community and the
rate of change continues to grow, the process will have to adjust
accordingly.  What changes come out of this discussion remain to be seen.
But it's worth noting that Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/269225/">fears</a> that the biggest problem - regressions
and bugs - will be relatively unaffected.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

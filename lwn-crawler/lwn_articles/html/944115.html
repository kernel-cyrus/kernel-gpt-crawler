           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 18, 2023</br>
           </div>
Processes in a Linux system run within their own virtual address spaces.
Their virtual addresses map to physical pages provided by the hardware, but
the kernel takes pains to hide the physical addresses of those pages;
processes normally have no way of knowing (and no need to know) where their
memory is located in physical memory.  As a result, the system calls for
memory management also deal in virtual addresses.  Gregory Price is
currently trying to create an exception to this rule with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230907075453.350554-1-gregory.price@memverge.com/">a
proposal</a> for a new system call that would operate on memory using physical
addresses.
<p>
<h4>When physical placement matters</h4>
Most of the time, user space is entirely happy to let the kernel worry
about where memory should be mapped; all physical pages are alike, so it
really does not matter which ones are used by a given process.  That
situation can change, though, in situations where all physical pages are
<i>not</i> alike.  Non-uniform memory-access (NUMA) machines are a case in
point; these machines are split into multiple nodes, each of which normally
contains one or more CPUs and some physical memory.  For a process
executing on a given node, memory attached to that same node will be faster
than memory on other nodes, so the placement of memory matters.
<p>
Kernel developers have been working on the NUMA problem for years, and have
developed a number of mechanisms to try to keep processes and their memory
together.  System calls can be used to bind processes to specific nodes, to
ask that memory be allocated on specific nodes, and to move pages of memory
from one node to another when needed.  There is always room for
improvement, but NUMA systems work well most of the time.
<p>
Hardware engineers are creative folks, though, and they have been busily
working on other ways to create different types of memory.  Contemporary
systems still have traditional RAM, but memory might also be located on a
peripheral device, in a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory">non-volatile
RAM</a> array, in a bank of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">high-bandwidth
memory</a>, or in an external <a href="/Articles/894598/">CXL device</a>.
In each of those cases, the memory involved will have different performance
characteristics than ordinary RAM, once again making the physical placement
of a process's pages into an important concern.
<p>
Since the NUMA concept already exists and is able to represent different
classes of memory, it has been extended to handle these newer memory types
as well.  Each bank of "different" memory is normally organized into its
own CPU-less NUMA node.  The existing system calls controlling memory
allocation can then be used to locate pages within these special nodes.
That solves the management problem at a low level, but it is really only
the beginning.
<p>
In many cases, the desired result for systems with multiple memory types is
some form of memory tiering, where pages are migrated between memory types
depending on how heavily they are used.  Ideally, heavily used pages should
be located in the system's fastest memory, while rarely used pages can be
put out to pasture in slower memory.  Finding an optimal way to move pages
between memory tiers is <a href="/Articles/931421/">an area of active
development</a>, and a number of questions remain open.
<p>

<h4>Tiering in user space</h4>
<p>
In this context, Price is seeking to add a new system call to allow some of
those migration decisions to be made in user space.  There are some
existing interfaces that can be used to determine which physical pages are
(or are not) in active use; devices providing memory can also, sometimes,
provide this information.  Using this data, a user-space management process
could decide to move pages into the type of memory that is best suited to
their current usage profile.
<p>
There is a problem, though.  That information, being tied to physical
pages, lacks any connection to the processes using those pages.  A
user-space program wanting to force page migrations based on this
information would first have to convert the physical page addresses into
(process, virtual-address) pairs for use with the existing system calls.
That is a non-trivial and expensive task.  Price is looking for a way to
move pages between memory types without the need for an awareness of which
processes are using those pages.
<p>
The result is a new system call, <tt>move_phy_pages()</tt>, that is
patterned after the existing <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/move_pages.2.html"><tt>move_pages()</tt></a>
call (which uses virtual addresses); it is otherwise completely
undocumented at this point.  The interface appears to be:
<p>
<pre>
    int move_phy_pages(unsigned long count, void **pages, int *nodes,
    		       int *status, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attempt to move <tt>count</tt> pages, the physical addresses
of which are stored in the <tt>pages</tt> array; each page will be moved to
the NUMA node indicated by the appropriate entry in <tt>nodes</tt>.  The
<tt>status</tt> array will be filled in with information about what
happened to each page; on success, the <tt>status</tt> entry will contain
the page's new node number.  The only relevant <tt>flags</tt> value appears
to be <tt>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL</tt>, which instructs the call to move pages
that are mapped by multiple processes; otherwise only singly mapped pages
are moved.
<p>
If the <tt>nodes</tt> array is <tt>NULL</tt>, the system call will,
instead, just store the status of each of the indicated <tt>pages</tt> in
<tt>status</tt>.  There are limits to how useful that is, since the node
number of physical pages is already described by their physical address and
does not normally change over time.
<p>
In reviewing the patch, Arnd Bergmann <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f73d0495-f575-4b97-bc74-a57bd427df98@app.fastmail.com/">questioned</a>
the use of the <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> type for the <tt>pages</tt> array.  The
values provided there are not actually pointers that can be dereferenced in
any context; instead, they are used by the kernel to obtain the page-frame
numbers (PFNs) for the pages of interest.  Since, in some 32-bit
configurations, full physical addresses may not fit within a normal pointer
type, Bergmann <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/2fe03345-01a2-4cfe-9648-ae088493d1af@app.fastmail.com/">suggested</a>
using the <tt>__u64</tt> type instead.
<p>
That conversation also raised the question of whether, instead, user space
should be providing PFNs to <tt>move_phy_pages()</tt>.  As Bergmann pointed
out, there are no system calls that accept PFNs now, so that would be
breaking new ground.  That, though, reflects the fact that, until now,
system calls do not normally deal with physical addresses at all.  If this
work goes forward, finding a consensus on the best way to refer to such
addresses, for <tt>move_phy_pages()</tt> and anything that might follow —
will be important.
<p>
Whether this work will actually move forward remains to be seen.  It is,
almost by definition, an interface to move pages around without knowing
which processes are using them; otherwise, <tt>move_pages()</tt> could be
used instead.  Perhaps the information regarding physical memory and its
utilization that is available to user space (Price provided a list of
information sources in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZPrRcJCjRBvJ9c3N@memverge.com/">this message</a>) is
sufficient to make useful decisions, but that would probably need to be
demonstrated somehow.  This patch provides access to functionality that is
normally kept deeply within the memory-management subsystem; developers
will want to see that the benefits it provides justify that intrusion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I am confident that there would be many eyes on all patches resulting from this conversation, and my ignorance is vast, but this would seem to open the "attack surface" of the kernel wider. Wouldn't you have to worry more about unauthorized attempts to access memory allocated to other processes? Or devices driver mapped memory?<br>
<p>
And what about subtle interactions between the mechanisms used for virtual mappings and physical mapping by the kernel? If these subsystems are not "aware" of each other, could new bugs be introduced that would be hard to test for?<br>
<p>
I'm not saying I believe one path or the other are better, but the security angle seems interesting here.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

      Another potential security issue is that moving pages to a slower memory tier can help attackers using timing side channels.

Why can't the process wanting to migrate the page just mmap it, even use the virtual memory APIs? How does it know what the right PFN even is? This API seems bad.<br>

It seems BPF should be more suitable for this kind of management decision than a user space application.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, if the app knows so much about physical memory, can kernel just disable virtual memory or at least make it map 1-to-1to physical memory for an app running exclusively on some Numa node?<br>

I'm just missing "Rust" for bingo.  We are at the writing numbers on the table stage now ...<br>

Given that the original motivation is<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; For a process executing on a given node, memory attached to that same node will be faster than memory on other nodes, so the placement of memory matters. </span><br>
<p>
But the proposed implementation is trying to<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; move pages between memory types without the need for an awareness of which processes are using those pages.</span><br>
<p>
I seriously doubt success will be achieved.<br>
<p>
If user-space detects a fast tier is under utilised but does not want to analyse process by process which one would benefit from a relocation, surely an API prompting the kernel to fill the fast tier, looking itself for the processes that would benefit most would be more appropriate ?<br>

For whatever reason, this patch set never made it to the linux-mm mailing list, which may be why it has had so little feedback.<br>
<p>
It's an ugly design that solves the wrong problem in the wrong way.<br>

      FWIW, there is <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230919230909.530174-1-gregory.price@memverge.com/">a V2 patch set</a> out there now, without feedback so far.

I know about CXL, but I fail to see why one would want "profiling mechanisms" to live outside the kernel and move physical pages around. What am I missing ?<br>

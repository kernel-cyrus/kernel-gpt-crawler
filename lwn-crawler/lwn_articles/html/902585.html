           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 29, 2022</br>
           </div>
As a general rule, virtualization mechanisms are designed to provide strong
isolation between a host and the guest systems that it runs.  The guests
are not trusted, and their ability to access or influence anything outside
of their virtual machines must be tightly controlled.  So a patch series
allowing guests to execute arbitrary system calls in the host context might
be expected to be the cause of significantly elevated eyebrows across the
net.  Andrei Vagin has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220722230241.1944655-1-avagin@google.com/">such a
series</a> with the expected results.
<p>
The use case for Vagin's work is <a href="https://gvisor.dev/">gVisor</a>,
a container-management platform with a focus on security.  Like a full
virtualization system, gVisor runs
containers within a virtual machine (using KVM), but the purpose is not to
fully isolate those containers from the system.  Instead, KVM is used to
provide address-space isolation for processes within containers, but the
resulting virtual machines do not run a normal operating-system kernel.  Instead,
they run a special gVisor kernel that handles system calls made by the
contained processes, making security decisions as it goes.
<p>
That kernel works in an interesting way; it maps
itself into each virtual machine's address space to match its layout on the
host, then switches between the two as needed.  The function to go to the
virtual-machine side is called, perhaps inevitably, <tt>bluepill()</tt>.
The execution environment is essentially the same on either side, with the
same memory layout, but the guest side is constrained by the
boundaries placed on the virtual machine.
<p>
Many of the application's system calls can be executed by gVisor within the
virtual machine, but some of them must be handled in the less-constrained
context of the host.
It certainly works for gVisor to simply perform a
virtual-machine exit to have the controlling process on the host side
execute the call, then return the result back into the virtual machine, but
exits are slow.  Performing a lot of exits can badly hurt the performance
of the workload overall; since part of the purpose of a system like gVisor
is to provide better performance than pure virtualization, that is seen as
undesirable.
<p>
The proposed solution is to provide a new hypercall (<tt>KVM_HC_HOST_SYSCALL</tt>)
that the guest kernel can use to run a system call directly on the host.
It takes two parameters: the system-call number and a <tt>pt_regs</tt>
structure containing the parameters for that system call.  After executing
the call in the host context (without actually exiting from the
virtual machine), this hypercall will return the result back to the caller.
This interface only works if the guest knows enough about the host's memory
layout to provide sensible system-call parameters; in the gVisor case,
where the memory layout is the same on both sides, no special attention is
required. 

<p>

Internally, this functionality works by way of a new helper called <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220722230241.1944655-2-avagin@google.com/"><tt>do_ksyscall_64()</tt></a>,
which can invoke any system call from within the kernel.  Given that
invoking system calls in this way is generally frowned upon, this
functionality seems sure to be a lightning rod for criticism and, indeed,
Thomas Gleixner duly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87a68vtvhf.ffs@tglx/">complained</a>: "<q>this
exposes a magic kernel syscall interface to random driver
writers. Seriously no</q>".  While he acknowledged that the series overall
is "<q>a clever idea</q>", he made it clear that exposing system calls in
this way was not going to fly.
<p>
Meanwhile, the ability to invoke host-side system calls directly from a KVM
guest pokes a major hole in the isolation between virtual 
machines and the host.  Indeed, the cover letter describes it as "<q>a
backdoor for regular virtual machines</q>".  Thus, as one would expect,
the direct system-call feature is disabled by default; processes that want
to use it must enable it explicitly when creating a virtual machine.  Most
hypervisors, it is to be expected, will not do that.
<p>
The kernels running deep within companies like Google often contain
significant changes that are not found in the upstream code; this patch set
gives a hint of what one of those changes looks like:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In the Google kernel, we have a kvm-like subsystem designed
	especially for gVisor. This change is the first step of integrating
	it into the KVM code base and making it available to all Linux
	users.
</blockquote>
<p>
That led Sean Christopherson to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yts1tUfPxdPH5XGs@google.com/">ask</a> about what the
following steps would be.  "<q>It's practically impossible to review this
series without first understanding the bigger picture</q>".  Merging this
first step could be a mistake if the following steps turn out not to be
acceptable; at that point, the kernel community could find itself
supporting a partial feature that is not actually being used.  As it turns
out, Vagin <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAEWA0a4hrRb5HYLqa1Q47=guY6TLsWSJ_zxNjOXXV2jCjUekUA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>,
this is the 
only feature that is needed.  gVisor works on top of KVM now, he said; the
current patch series just improves its performance.
<p>
Christopherson also asked about alternatives, noting that "<q>making
arbitrary syscalls from within KVM is mildly terrifying</q>".  Vagin
provided a few, starting with the current scheme where a virtual-machine
exit is used to (slowly) handle each system call.
Another approach is to run <i>all</i> of gVisor on the host side, exiting from the
virtual machine for every system call.  Executing a system call in this
mode takes about 2.1µs; the direct system-call mechanism reduces that to
about 1.0µs.  Or gVisor could use BPF to handle the system calls; that
provides similar performance, Vagin said, but would require some
questionable changes, like providing BPF programs with the ability to
invoke arbitrary system calls.  Yet another possibility is to use the
once-proposed <a href="/Articles/852662/"><tt>process_vm_exec()</tt> system
call</a>, but that can perform poorly in some situations.
<p>
KVM maintainer Paolo Bonzini <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/69b45487-ce0e-d643-6c48-03c5943ce2e6@redhat.com/">said</a>
that his largest objection is the lack of address translation between the
guest and the host.  In its current form, this mechanism depends on the
memory layout being the same on both sides; otherwise any addresses in an
argument to a system call would not make sense on the host side.  As a
result, the new mechanism is highly specialized for gVisor and seems
unlikely to be more widely useful.  It is not clear that everybody sees
that specialization as a disadvantage, though.
<p>
All told, gVisor in this mode represents an interesting shift in the
security boundary between a host and the containers it runs.  Much of the
security depends on code that is within the virtual machine, with the host
side trusting that code at a fairly deep level.  It is a different view of
how virtualization with KVM is meant to work, but it seems that the result
works well — within Google at least.  Whether this mechanism will make it
into the mainline remains an open question, though.  Making holes in the
wall between host and guest is not something to be done lightly, so the
developers involved are likely to want to be sure that no better
alternatives exist.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Interesting; for a while I&#x27;ve wondered if there are possible gains in using virtualization hardware to harden regular process/namespace/container isolation, maybe also useful for things like PTI.<br>
<p>
One could imagine a system where each systemd slice (substitute your preferred cgroup managing tool here) is totally isolated not just from the kernel address space but other ring-3 processes. The mainframe crowd&#x27;s probably had this sort of thing for decades, mind...<br>

Prior to the heavy containerization and namespaces being available on everything and dog there was a lot of projects using essentially low-level KVM just to package an individual process in a similar way. I think Firecracker would be one of the most well known surviving example of that approach these days.<br>

For general use, I like from the multi layer security approach, something like:<br>
- Use liburing mechanism (shared ring buffer between host and guest) to avoid context switches. Preferred: avoid pinned memory pitfalls.<br>
- KVM host kernel has security checks enabled, and small attack surface (against KVM guest Kernel) via liburing.<br>
- KVM guest kernel has the same via liburing.<br>
- Keep power consumption low (no unnecessary Kernel side CPU thread busy looping by default).<br>

This reminds me a LOT of QEMU&#x27;s user-mode emulation, where it runs a single binary (not an OS) and translates syscalls between CPU architectures. It&#x27;s a real shame that good documentation on this mode seems few and far between.<br>

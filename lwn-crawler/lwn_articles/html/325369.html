<h1>Union file systems: Implementations, part I</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="GAByline">
           <p>March 25, 2009</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Valerie Aurora</p>
           </div>
In <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">last week's article</a>,
I reviewed the use cases, basic concepts, and common design problems
of unioning file systems.  This week, I'll describe several
implementations of unioning file systems in technical detail.  The
unioning file systems I'll cover in this article are Plan 9 union
directories, BSD union mounts, Linux union mounts.  The next article
will cover unionfs, aufs, and possibly one or two other unioning file
systems, and wrap up the series.
<p>

For each file system, I'll describe its basic architecture, features,
and implementation.  The discussion of the implementation will focus
in particular on whiteouts and directory reading.  I'll wrap up with
a look at the software engineering aspects of each implementations;
e.g., code size and complexity, invasiveness, and burden on file system
developers.

<p>

Before reading this article, you might want to check out Andreas
Gruenbacher's just published write-up of
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325126/">union mount workshop</a>
held last November.  It's a good summary of the unioning file systems
features which are most pressing for distribution developers.  From
the introduction: "<q>All of the use cases we are interested in basically
boil down to the same thing: having an image or filesystem that is
used read-only (either because it is not writable, or because writing
to the image is not desired), and pretending that this image or
filesystem is writable, storing changes somewhere else.</q>"
<p>

<h3>Plan 9 union directories</h3>

The <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan 9 operating
system</a>
(<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/">browseable
source code here</a>) implements unioning in its own special Plan&nbsp;9
way.  In Plan&nbsp;9 union directories, only the top-level directory
namespace is merged, not any subdirectories.  Unconstrained by UNIX
standards, Plan&nbsp;9 union directories don't implement whiteouts and
don't even screen out duplicate entries - if the same file name
appears in two file systems, it is simply returned twice in directory
listings.
<p>

A Plan 9 union directory is created like so:
<pre>
    bind -a /home/val/bin/ /bin
</pre>

This would cause the directory <code>/home/val/bin</code> to be union
mounted "after" (the <code>-a</code> option) <code>/bin</code>; other
options are to place the new directory before the existing directory,
or to replace the existing directory entirely. (This seems an odd
ordering to me, since I like commands in my personal <code>bin/</code>
to take precedence over the system-wide commands, but that's the
example from the Plan&nbsp;9 documentation.) Brian Kernighan
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/2nd_edition/README">explains one
of the uses of union directories</a>: "<q>This mechanism of union
directories replaces the search path of conventional UNIX shells. As
far as you are concerned, all executable programs are in /bin.</q>"  Union
directories can theoretically replace many uses of the fundamental
UNIX building blocks of symbolic links and search paths.
<p>

Without whiteouts or duplicate elimination, <code>readdir()</code> on
union directories is trivial to implement.  Directory entry offsets
from the underlying file system correspond directly to the offset in
bytes of the directory entry from the beginning of the directory.  A
union directory is treated as though the contents of the underlying
directories are concatenated together.
<p>

Plan 9 implements an alternative to <code>readdir()</code> worth
noting, <code><a href="http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/2/dirread">dirread()</a></code>.
<code>dirread()</code> returns structures of type <code>Dir</code>,
described in the <a href="http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/2/stat">stat()
man page</a>.  The important part of the <code>Dir</code> is
the <code>Qid</code> member.  A <code>Qid</code> is:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
...a structure
containing <tt>path</tt> and <tt>vers</tt> fields: <tt>path</tt> is
guaranteed to be unique among 
all path names currently on the file server, and <tt>vers</tt> changes each
time the file is modified.  The <tt>path</tt> is a long long (64 bits, <tt>vlong</tt>)
and the <tt>vers</tt> is an unsigned long (32 bits, <tt>ulong</tt>).
</div>
<p>
So why is this interesting?  One of the
reasons <code>readdir()</code> is such a pain to implement is that it
returns the <code>d_off</code> member of <code>struct dirent</code>, a
single <code>off_t</code> (32 bits unless the application is compiled
with large file support), to mark the directory entry where an
application should continue reading on the next <code>readdir()</code>
call.  This works fine as long as <code>d_off</code> is a simple byte
offset into a flat file of less than 2<sup>32</sup> bytes and existing directory
entries are never moved around - not the case for many modern file
systems (XFS, btrfs, ext3 with htree indexes).  The
96-bit <code>Qid</code> is a much more useful place marker than the 32
or 64-bit off_t.  For a good summary of the issues involved in
implementing <code>readdir()</code>,
read <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/btrfs-devel/2008-January/000463.html">Theodore
Y. Ts'o's excellent post</a> on the topic to the btrfs mailing list.
<p>

From a software engineering standpoint, Plan 9 union directories are
heavenly.  Without whiteouts, duplicate entry elimination, complicated
directory offsets, or merging of namespaces beyond the top-level
directory, the implementation is simple and easy to maintain.
However, any practical implementation of unioning file systems for
Linux (or any other UNIX) would have to solve these problems.  For our
purposes, Plan&nbsp;9 union directories serve primarily as inspiration.
<p>

<h3>BSD union mounts</h3>

BSD implements two forms of unioning: the <code>"-o union"</code>
option to the <code>mount</code> command, which produces a union
directory similar to Plan&nbsp;9's, and the <code>mount_unionfs</code>
command, which implements a more full-featured unioning file system
with whiteouts and merging of the entire namespace.  We will focus on
the latter.
<p>

For this article, we use two sources for specific implementation
details: the original BSD union mount implementation as described in
the 1995 USENIX paper
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/neworl/full_papers/mckusick.ps">Union
mounts in 4.4BSD-Lite [PS]</a>, and
the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_unionfs&sektion=8&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+7.1-RELEASE+and+Ports">FreeBSD
7.1 <code>mount_unionfs</code> man page</a> and source code.  Other
BSDs may vary.
<p>

A directory can be union mounted either "below" or "above" an existing
directory or union mount, as long as the top branch of a writable
union is writable.  Two modes of whiteouts are supported: either a
whiteout is always created when a directory is removed, or it is only
created if another directory entry with that name currently exists in
a branch below the writable branch.  Three modes for setting the
ownership and mode of copied-up files are supported.  The simplest is
<code>transparent</code>, in which the new file keeps the same owner
and mode of the original.  The <code>masquerade</code> mode makes
copied-up files owned by a particular user and supports a set of
mount options for determining the new file mode.
The <code>traditional</code> mode sets the owner to the user who ran
the union mount command, and sets the mode according to the umask at
the time of the union mount.
<p>

Whenever a directory is opened, a directory of the same name is
created on the top writable layer if it doesn't already exist.  From
the paper:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
By creating shadow directories aggressively during lookup the union
filesystem avoids having to check for and possibly create the chain of
directories from the root of the mount to the point of a copy-up.
Since the disk space consumed by a directory is negligible, creating
directories when they were first traversed seemed like a better
alternative.
</div>
<p>
As a result, a <code>"find /union"</code> will result in copying every
directory (but not directory entries pointing to non-directories) to
the writable layer.  For most file system images, this will use a
negligible amount of space (less than, e.g., the space reserved for
the root user, or that taken up by unused inodes in an FFS-style file
system).
<p>

A file is copied up to the top layer when it is opened with write
permission or the file attributes are changed. (Since directories are
copied over when they are opened, the containing directory is
guaranteed to already exist on the writable layer.) If the file to be
copied up has multiple hard links, the other links are ignored and the
new file has a link count of one.  This may break applications that
use hard links and expect modifications through one link name to show
up when referenced through a different hard link.  Such applications
are relatively uncommon, but no one has done a systematic study to see
which applications will fail in this situation.
<p>

Whiteouts are implemented with a special directory entry
type, <code>DH_WHT</code>.  Whiteout directory entries don't refer to
any real inode, but for easy compatibility with existing file system
utilities such as <code>fsck</code>, each whiteout directory entry
includes a faux inode number, the <code>WINO</code> reserved whiteout
inode number.  The underlying file system must be modified to support
the whiteout directory entry type.  New directories that replace a
whiteout entry are marked as opaque via a new "opaque" inode attribute
so that lookups don't travel through them (again requiring minimal
support from the underlying file system).
<p>

Duplicate directory entries and whiteouts are handled in the userspace
<code>readdir()</code> implementation.  At <code>opendir()</code>
time, the C library reads the directory all at once, removes
duplicates, applies whiteouts, and caches the results.
<p>

BSD union mounts don't attempt to deal with changes to branches below
the writable top branch (although they are permitted).  The
way <code>rename()</code> is handled is not described.
<p>

An example from the <code>mount_unionfs</code> man page:
<p>

<pre>
    The commands

        mount -t cd9660 -o ro /dev/cd0 /usr/src
        mount -t unionfs -o noatime /var/obj /usr/src

    mount the CD-ROM drive /dev/cd0 on /usr/src and then attaches /var/obj on
    top.  For most purposes the effect of this is to make the source tree
    appear writable even though it is stored on a CD-ROM.  The -o noatime
    option is useful to avoid unnecessary copying from the lower to the upper
    layer.
</pre>

Another example (noting that I believe source control is best
implemented outside of the file system):
<p>

<pre>
    The command

        mount -t unionfs -o noatime -o below /sys $HOME/sys

    attaches the system source tree below the sys directory in the user's
    home directory.  This allows individual users to make private changes to
    the source, and build new kernels, without those changes becoming visible
    to other users.
</pre>

<h3>Linux union mounts</h3>
<p>
Like BSD union mounts, Linux union mounts implement file system
unioning in the VFS layer, with some minor support from underlying
file systems for whiteouts and opaque directory tags.  Several
versions of these patches exist, written and modified by Jan Blunck,
Bharata B. Rao, and Miklos Szeredi, among others.
<p>

One version of this code is merges the top-level directories only,
similar to Plan&nbsp;9 union directories and the BSD <code>-o union</code>
mount option.  This version of union mounts, which I refer to as union
directories, are described in some detail in a
recent <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/312641/">LWN article by
Goldwyn Rodrigues</a> and
in <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308920/">Miklos Szeredi's recent
post of an updated patch set</a>.  For the remainder of this article,
we will focus on versions of union mount that merge the full
namespace.
<p>

Linux union mounts are currently under active development.  This
article describes the version released by Jan Blunck against Linux
2.6.25-mm1, util-linux 2.13, and e2fsprogs 1.40.2.  The patch sets, as
quilt series, can be downloaded from Jan's ftp site:

<p>

I have created a web page with links to git versions of the above
patches and some HOWTO-style documentation
at <a
href="http://valerieaurora.org/union">http://valerieaurora.org/union</a>.

<p>

A union is created by mounting a file system with
the <code>MS_UNION</code> flag
set. (The <code>MS_BEFORE</code>, <code>MS_AFTER</code>,
and <code>MS_REPLACE</code> are defined in the <code>mount</code> code
base but not currently used.) If the <code>MS_UNION</code> flag is
specified, then the mounted file system must either be read-only or
support whiteouts.  In this version of union mounts, the union mount
flag is specified by the "<code>-o&nbsp;union</code>" option
to <code>mount</code>.  For example, to create a union of two loopback
device file systems, /img/ro and /img/rw, you would run:
<p>

<pre>
    # mount -o loop,ro,union /img/ro /mnt/union/
    # mount -o loop,union /img/rw /mnt/union/
</pre>

Each union mount creates a <code>struct union_mount</code>:

<pre>
    struct union_mount {
	atomic_t u_count;		/* reference count */
	struct mutex u_mutex;
	struct list_head u_unions;	/* list head for d_unions */
	struct hlist_node u_hash;	/* list head for searching */
	struct hlist_node u_rhash;	/* list head for reverse searching */
	struct path u_this;		/* this is me */
	struct path u_next;		/* this is what I overlay */
    };
</pre>

As described
in <code>Documentation/filesystems/union-mounts.txt</code>, "All
union_mount structures are cached in two hash tables, one for lookups
of the next lower layer of the union stack and one for reverse lookups
of the next upper layer of the union stack."
<p>

Whiteouts and opaque directories are implemented in much the same way
as in BSD.  The underlying file system must explicitly support whiteouts
by defining the <code>.whiteout</code> inode operation for directories
(currently, whiteouts are only implemented for ext2, ext3, and tmpfs).
The ext2 and ext3 implementations use the whiteout directory entry
type, <code>DT_WHT</code>, which has been defined
in <code>include/linux/fs.h</code> for years but not used outside of
the Coda file system until now.  A reserved whiteout inode
number, <code>EXT3_WHT_INO</code>, is defined but not yet used;
whiteout entries currently allocate a normal inode.  A new inode
flag, <code>S_OPAQUE</code>, is defined to mark directories as opaque.
As in BSD, directories are only marked opaque when they replace a
whiteout entry.
<p>

Files are copied up when the file is opened for writing.  If
necessary, each directory in the path to the file is copied to the top
branch (copy-on-demand of directories).  Currently, copy up is only
supported for regular files and directories.
<p>

<code>readdir()</code> is one of the weakest points of the current
implementation.  It is implemented the same way as BSD union mount
<code>readdir()</code>, but in the kernel.  The <code>d_off</code>
field is set to the offset within the current underlying directory,
minus the sizes of the previous directories.  Directory entries from
directories underneath the top layer must be checked against previous
entries for duplicates or whiteouts.  As currently implemented,
each <code>readdir()</code> (technically, <code>getdents()</code>)
system call reads all of the previous directory entries into an
in-kernel cache, then compares each entry to be returned with those
already in the cache before copying it to the user buffer.  The end
result is that <code>readdir()</code> is complex, slow, and
potentially allocates a great deal of kernel memory.
<p>

One solution is to take the BSD approach and do the caching, whiteout,
and duplicate processing in userspace.  Bharata B. Rao
is <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2008-03/msg00032.html">designing
support for union mount <code>readdir()</code> in glibc</a>.
(The POSIX standard permits <code>readdir()</code> to be implemented
at the libc level if the bare kernel system call does not fulfill all
the requirements.) This would move the memory usage into the
application and make the cache persistent.  Another solution would be
to make the in-kernel cache persistent in some way.
<p>

My suggestion is to take a technique from BSD union mounts and extend
it: proactively copy up not just directory entries for directories,
but all of the directory entries from lower file systems, process
duplicates and whiteouts, make the directory opaque, and write it out
to disk.  In effect, you are processing the directory entries for
whiteouts and duplicates on the first open of the directory, and then
writing the resulting "cache" of directory entries to disk.  The
directory entries pointing to files on the underlying file systems
need to signify somehow that they are "fall-through" entries (the
opposite of a whiteout - it explicitly requests looking up an object
in a lower file system).  A side effect of this approach is that
whiteouts are no longer needed at all.
<p>

One problem that needs to be solved with this approach is how to
represent directory entries pointing to lower file systems.  A number
of solutions present themselves: the entry could point to a reserved
inode number, the file system could allocate an inode for each entry
but mark it with a new <code>S_LOOKOVERTHERE</code> inode attribute,
it could create a symlink to a reserved target, etc.  This approach
would use more space on the overlying file system, but all other
approaches require allocating the same space in memory, and generally
memory is more dear than disk.
<p>

A less pressing issue with the current implementation is that inode
numbers are not stable across boot
(see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">the previous unioning
    file systems article for details on why this is a problem</a>).
If "fall-through" directories are implemented by allocating an inode
for each directory entry on underlying file systems, then stable inode
numbers will be a natural side effect.  Another option is to store a
persistent inode map somewhere - in a file in the top-level directory,
or in an external file system, perhaps.
<p>

Hard links are handled - or, more accurately, not handled - in the
same way as BSD union mounts.  Again, it is not clear how many
applications depend on modifying a file via one hard-linked path and
seeing the changes via another hard-linked path (as opposed to symbolic
link).  The only method I can come up with to handle this correctly is
to keep a persistent cache somewhere on disk of the inodes we have
encountered with multiple hard links.
<p>

Here's an example of how it would work: Say we start a copy up for
inode 42 and find that it has a link count of three.  We would create an
entry for the hard link database that includes the file system id, the
inode number, the link count, and the inode number of the new copy on
the top level file system.  It could be stored in a file in CSV
format, or as a symlink in a reserved directory in the root directory
(e.g., "<code>/.hardlink_hack/&lt;fs_id&gt;/42</code>", which is a
link to "<code>&lt;new_inode_num&gt; 3</code>"), or in a real
database.  Each time we open an inode on an underlying file system, we
look it up in our hard link database; if an entry exists, we decrement
the link count and create a hard link to the correct inode on the new
file system.  When all of the paths are found, the link count drops to
one and the entry can be deleted from the database.  The nice thing
about this approach is that the amount of overhead is bounded and will
disappear entirely when all the paths to the relevant inodes have been
looked up.  However, this still introduces a significant amount of
possibly unnecessary complexity; the BSD implementation shows that
many applications will happily run with not-quite-POSIXLY-correct hard
link behavior.
<p>

Currently, <code>rename()</code> of directories across branches
returns <code>EXDEV</code>, the error for trying to rename a file
across different file systems.  User space usually handles this
transparently (since it already has to handle this case for
directories from different file systems) and falls back to copying the
contents of the directory over one by one.  Implementing
recursive <code>rename()</code> of directories across branches in the
kernel is not a bright idea for the same reasons as rename across
regular file systems; probably returning <code>EXDEV</code> is the
best solution.
<p>

From a software engineering point of view, union mounts seem to be a
reasonable compromise between features and ease of maintenance.  Most
of the VFS changes are isolated into <code>fs/union.c</code>, a file
of about 1000 lines.  About 1/3 of this file is the
in-kernel <code>readdir()</code> implementation, which will almost
certainly be replaced by something else before any possible merge.
The changes to underlying file systems are fairly minimal and only
needed for file systems mounted as writable branches.  The main
obstacle to merging this code is the <code>readdir()</code>
implementation.  Otherwise, file system maintainers have been
noticeably more positive about union mounts than any other unioning
implementation.
<p>

AFAICT, the fall-through idea is really interesting but may get <br>
problematic when the lower-level file system is modified. The original <br>
union mount code should be able to handle readdir (after a new opendir) <br>
and lookup even if the lower file system is bind-mounted to another <br>
location and updated concurrently.<br>
<p>
If you duplicate the entire directory structure in the top level of the <br>
union, this would not even easily work in the case where you unmount the <br>
top level, modify the lower level and then recreate the union mount.<br>

I think the key to getting a maintainable unioning file system is limiting the feature set.  Okay, Linux union mounts won't slice, dice, AND puree your files - but they will cover many common cases.<br>
<p>
If you don't agree, just wait for the aufs article - it is almost certain to implement any feature you want.<br>

I absolutely agree that the feature set needs to be limited, and that's <br>
what makes the Plan9 way of union mounts so beautiful (thanks for <br>
describing it here, I didn't know how it works before).<br>
<p>
Limiting the implementation so that you can never change the underlying <br>
file system any more may be worth it but is still quite drastic, so I <br>
thought it should be mentioned more explicitly.<br>

Not only that but since you cache the consolidated directory entries on disk, you will not be able to union mount your top layer later on any other lower layer filesystem. <br>
<p>
I know that supporting all sorts of corner cases and features has caused major pains for union mount, but this restriction sounds a bit too restrictive to me :)<br>

This also will cause problems if you want to use union mount in server consolidation environments where you have multiple servers working out of a common base distribution as their lower layer. With your scheme, I will not be able to do updates (like security updates) to the base distribution and see it getting effected in all the servers.<br>

Userspace whiteouts -- what about security? Doesn't that mean (at the very least) that I could see the names of deleted files? Or even maybe be able to open them? That doesn't seem to work -- there are too many things that will assume that once a file is deleted, it's deleted...<br>

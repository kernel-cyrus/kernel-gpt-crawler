<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 18, 2020</br>
           </div>
The discussion started out as a <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20200914204209.256266093@linutronix.de/">straightforward
patch set</a> from Thomas Gleixner making a minor change to how preemption
counting is handled.  The resulting discussion quickly spread out to cover
a number of issues relevant to core-kernel development in surprisingly few
messages; each of those topics merits a quick look, starting with how the
preemption counter itself works.  Sometimes a simple count turns out to not
be as simple as it seems.

<p>
<h4>preempt_count()</h4>
<p>
In a multitasking system like Linux, no thread of execution is guaranteed exclusive
access to the processor for as long as it would like to run; the kernel can
(almost) always preempt a running thread in favor of one that has a higher
priority.  That new thread might be a different process, but it might also
be a hardware interrupt or other outside event.  In order to properly
coordinate the running of all of a system's tasks, the kernel must keep
track of the current execution state, including anything that has been
preempted or which might prevent a thread from being preempted.
<p>
One piece of the infrastructure for that tracking is the preemption
counter that is stored with every task in the system.  That counter is
accessed via the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.9/source/include/asm-generic/preempt.h#L9"><tt>preempt_count()</tt>
function</a> which, in its generic form, looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    static __always_inline int preempt_count(void)
    {
	return READ_ONCE(current_thread_info()-&gt;preempt_count);
    }
</pre>
<p>
The purpose of this counter is to describe the current state of whatever
thread has been running, whether it can be preempted, and whether it is
allowed to sleep.  To do so, it must track a number of different states, so 
it is split into several sub-fields:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/preempt-count.svg" class="photo"
width=450px alt="[preempt_count]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
The least-significant byte tracks the nesting of <tt>preempt_disable()</tt>
calls — the number of times that preemption has been disabled so far.  The
next three fields track the number of times the running thread has been
interrupted by software, hardware, and non-maskable interrupts; they are
all probably oversized for the number of interruptions that is likely to
ever happen in real execution, but bits are not in short supply here.
Finally, the most-significant bit indicates whether the kernel has decided
that the current process needs to be scheduled out at the first
opportunity.
<p>
A look at this value tells the kernel a fair amount about what is going on
at any given time.  For example, any non-zero value for
<tt>preempt_count</tt> indicates that the current thread cannot be
preempted by the scheduler; either preemption has been disabled explicitly
or the CPU is currently servicing some sort of interrupt.  In the same way,
a non-zero value indicates that the current thread cannot sleep, since it
is running in a context that must be allowed to run to completion.  The
"reschedule needed" bit tells the kernel that there is a higher-priority
process that should be given the CPU at the first opportunity.  This bit 
cannot be set unless <tt>preempt_count</tt> is
non-zero; otherwise the kernel would have simply preempted the process
rather than setting the bit and waiting.
<p>
Code throughout the kernel uses <tt>preempt_count</tt> to make decisions
about which actions are possible at any given time.  That, as it turns out,
can be a bit of a problem for a few reasons.
<p>
<h4>Misleading counts</h4>
<p>
It is worth noting that <tt>preempt_disable()</tt> only applies when a
thread is running within the kernel; user-space code is always
preemptible.  In the distant past, the kernel did not support preemption of
kernel-space code at all; when that feature was added (as a way of
improving latency), it was also made configurable.  There are, as a result,
still systems out there that are running without kernel preemption at all;
it is a configuration that might make sense for some throughput-oriented
workloads.
<p>
If kernel code cannot be preempted, there is little value in tracking calls
to <tt>preempt_disable()</tt>; preemption is always disabled.  So the
kernel doesn't waste its time maintaining that information; in such kernels,
the preempt-disable count portion of <tt>preempt_count</tt> is always
zero.  The <tt>preemptible()</tt> function will always return false, since
the kernel is indeed not preemptible.  It all seems to make sense.
<p>
There are some problems that result from this behavior, though.  One is
that functions like 
in_atomic(), which indicates whether the 
kernel is currently running in atomic context, do not behave in the same
way.  On a kernel with preemption configured in, calling
<tt>preempt_disable()</tt> will cause <tt>in_atomic()</tt> to return true;
if preemption is configured out, <tt>preempt_disable()</tt> is a no-op and
<tt>in_atomic()</tt> will return false.  This can cause
<tt>in_atomic()</tt> to return false when, for example, spinlocks are held
— a situation that is indeed an atomic context.
<p>
Gleixner, in his patch set, points out some other problems that result from
this inconsistency and says that it is a problem overall:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The lack of such indicators which work on all kernel configurations
	is a constant source of trouble because developers either do not
	understand the implications or try to work around this
	inconsistency in weird ways.
</div>
<p>
His solution is to remove the conditional compilation for the
preemption-disable tracking, causing that counter to be maintained even in
kernels that do not support kernel preemption.  There is a cost in terms of
increased execution time and code size on machines running those
configurations, but Gleixner says that his benchmark testing "<q>did not
reveal any measurable impact</q>" from the change.
<p>
Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=win80rdof8Pb=5k6gT9j_v+hz-TQzKPVastZDvBe9RimQ@mail.gmail.com/">was
not convinced</a> about the value of this change, noting that the code
generation for spinlocks is indeed better when preemption is not possible.
Gleixner <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/871rj4owfn.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">reiterated</a>
that the effect is not measurable, and Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wj0eUuVQ=hRFZv_nY7g5ZLt7Fy3K7SMJL0ZCzniPtsbbg@mail.gmail.com/">conceded</a>
that the patch set does make the code simpler and "<q>has its very clear
charm</q>".

<h4>Using preempt_count</h4>
<p>

Torvalds's larger complaint, though, was about code that uses
<tt>preempt_count</tt> to change its behavior depending on the context.
Such code, he <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wht7kAeyR5xEW2ORj7m0hibVxZ3t+2ie8vNHLQfdbN2_g@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>,
is "<q>always simply fundamentally wrong</q>".  Code that changes its
behavior depending on the context should have that context passed in as a
parameter, he said, so that callers know what to expect.  Thus, the
<tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> flag to the memory-allocation functions is acceptable,
but changing behavior based on the return value from <tt>in_atomic()</tt>
is not.
<p>
To an extent, there is general agreement with this position.  Gleixner's
patch posting included a section with future plans to audit and fix callers of
functions like <tt>in_atomic()</tt> where, he says, "<q>the number of
buggy users is clearly the vast majority</q>".  Daniel Vetter <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAKMK7uHAk9-Vy2cof0ws=DrcD52GHiCDiyHbjLd19CgpBU2rKQ@mail.gmail.com/">added</a>
that, in his experience, "<q>code that tries to cleverly adjust its
behaviour depending upon the context it's running in is harder to
understand and blows up in more interesting ways</q>".
<p>
Paul McKenney, instead, <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20200916152956.GV29330@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72/">argued</a>
that some code has to be able to operate properly in different contexts;
the alternative would be an explosion of the API:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Now perhaps you like the idea of call_rcu() for schedulable
	contexts, call_rcu_nosched() when preemption is disabled,
	call_rcu_irqs_are_disabled() when interrupts are disabled,
	call_rcu_raw_atomic() from contexts where (for example) raw
	spinlocks are held, and so on.  However, from what I can see, most
	people instead consistently prefer that the RCU API instead be
	consolidated.
</div>
<p>
In response, Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wjsMycgMHJrCmeetR3r+K5bpSRtmVWfd8iaoQCYd_VYAg@mail.gmail.com/">clarified</a>
that he sees core-kernel code as having different requirements than the
rest.  Core code has to deal with multiple contexts and should always do
the right thing; code in drivers, instead, should not be changing its
behavior based on its view of the context.
<p>
No hard conclusions were reached in this branch of the discussion.  It does
seem likely, though, that code with context-dependent behavior will be
looked at more closely in the future.

<h4>Questioning high memory</h4>
<p>
One example of questionable use of <tt>preempt_count</tt>, in the crypto
code, was pointed out early in the discussion by Gleixner; it changes a memory
allocation mode in strange ways if it thinks that it's not currently
preemptible.  After some discussion, it <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAMj1kXHrDU50D08TwLfzz2hCK+8+C7KGPF99PphXtsOYZ-ff1g@mail.gmail.com/">turned
out</a>, according to Ard Biesheuvel, that the real purpose had been to
avoid using <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> if possible.
<p>
For those who are not immediately familiar with <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt>, a
look at <a href="/Articles/813201/">this article on high memory</a> might
be helpful.  In short: 32-bit machines can only map a limited amount of
memory into the kernel's address space; that amount is a little under 1GB
on most architectures and configurations.  Any memory that is not directly
mapped is deemed "high memory"; any page in high memory must be explicitly
(and temporarily) mapped into the kernel before the kernel can access its
contents.  The functions <tt>kmap()</tt> and <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> exist
to perform this mapping.
<p>
There are a few differences between those two functions, starting with the
fact that only <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> is callable in atomic context.
Beyond that, though, <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> is more efficient and is thus
seen as being strongly
preferable in any situation where it can be used, regardless of whether the caller
was running in atomic context before the call (the CPU will always be
running in atomic context while the mapping is in place).  As Biesheuvel
pointed out, though, the documentation doesn't reflect this preference and
encourages the use of <tt>kmap()</tt> instead, so that is what he did.
<p>
There is another reason to prefer <tt>kmap()</tt>, he added; a call
to <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> disables preemption even on 64-bit architectures,
where high memory does not exist and no temporary mapping need be made.
Using it would have resulted in much of 
the WireGuard VPN code running with preemption disabled, entirely
unnecessarily.  Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wir6LZ=4gHt8VDdASv=TmEMjEUONuzbt=s+DyXPCvxaBA@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a> that there is a reason for this behavior: it is there to cause code to fail on
64-bit machines if it does things that would not work on 32-bit machines
where high memory does exist.  It is essentially a debugging aid that is
making up for the fact that few developers run on 32-bit machines.
<p>
One way to optimize <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> on 64-bit systems, Gleixner <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/87een35woz.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">said</a>, would
be to make <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> sections be preemptible — no longer
atomic, in other words.  This approach has been taken in the realtime
kernels, he said, and "<q>it's not that horrible</q>".  The cost
would be to make <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> a little slower on systems where
high memory is in use.
<p>
That, it seems, is a cost that the development community is increasingly
willing to pay; Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wg_koVS=8bYurGCZ8zs=zDH5cOKVzFdoj4AkUWEW9mKjA@mail.gmail.com/">replied</a>
that he would like to start removing <tt>kmap()</tt> support entirely.
32-Bit systems will be around for some time yet, but they are increasingly
unlikely to be used in situations where lots of memory is needed.  Or, as
Torvalds put it: "<q>It's not that 32-bit is irrelevant, it's that
32-bit with large amounts of memory is irrelevant</q>".  Every time that
the cost of supporting high memory (which adds a significant amount of
complexity to the memory-management subsystem) makes itself felt, the
desire to take it out grows.
<p>
That said, nobody will be removing high-memory support right away.  But a
change that penalizes high-memory systems in favor of the systems that are being deployed
now, such as making <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> no longer be atomic, is
increasingly likely to be accepted.  Meanwhile, the other issues around
<tt>preempt_count</tt> remain mostly unresolved, but it seems likely that,
in the end, changes that bring correctness and reduce complexity will
probably win out.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As Daniel succinctly stated, using in_interrupt(), in_irq(), or preemptible() in device drivers is either a symptom of horrible locking design or laziness. Usually it is both.<br>

      Small correction about the <i>"reschedule needed"</i> bit. At least on x86. It starts out set, and is cleared when we need a schedule.
<p>
Why?
<p>
Because if an interrupt comes in and detects a schedule is needed but sees that the other bits in <i>preempt_count</i> are set, it clears this bit and returns.
<p>
Back on the task that is running, when it does a preempt_enable() the code there can do a dec and test on <i>preempt_count</i>. If it is zero, then it should call the scheduler.
<p>
<pre>
   if (dec_and_test(preempt_count))
        schedule();
</pre>
<p>
This lets us do a single test in preempt_enable() to know if it should schedule or not. Otherwise we need to do:
<pre>
  if (dec_and_test(preempt_count) &amp;&amp; need_resched_set())
    schedule();
</pre>

I do wish 32-bit systems with a quantity of memory appropriate for running Windows XP through 7 weren&#x27;t considered a weird niche that requires highmem voodoo until the end of time. Is that really the best option?<br>

As I remember things from the Old Days, Linux is limited to about 1 GB of RAM in 32 bit modes. Unless you use that voodoo.<br>
<p>
I remember needing to do kernel rebuilds or picking the correct Redhat kernels to get 3 GB userspace.<br>

      32-bit systems suitable for old Windows versions are also suitable for old Linux versions. Newer Linux versions may well assume they are a weird niche.

The problem is those old versions did too. Memory between 896MB-4GB has always been a kludge under x86 Linux.<br>

Why does preempt_count need to be maintained for every thread? Since a non-preemptible thread can never be scheduled away, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to track preempt_count per-CPU instead?<br>

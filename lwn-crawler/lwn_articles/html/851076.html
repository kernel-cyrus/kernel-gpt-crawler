<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>March 31, 2021</br>
           </div>
<p>
A problem reported when attaching GDB to programs that use <a
href="/Articles/810414/">io_uring</a> has led to a flurry of potential
solutions, and one that was merged into Linux 5.12-rc5.  The problem
stemmed from a change made in the&nbsp;<a href="/Articles/847451/">5.12
merge window</a> to
how the threads used by io_uring were created, such that they became associated
with the process using io_uring.  Those "I/O threads" were treated
specially in the kernel, but that led to the problem with GDB (and likely other <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>-using
programs).  The solution is to treat them like other threads because it
turned out that trying to make
them special caused more problems than it solved. 
</p>

<p>
Stefan Metzmacher <a
href="/ml/io-uring/d1a8958c-aec7-4f94-45f8-f4c2f2ecacff@samba.org/">reported</a>
the problem to the io-uring mailing list on March&nbsp;20.  He tried to
attach GDB to the process of a program using io_uring, but the
debugger went "<q>into an endless loop because it can't attach to the
io_threads</q>".  
<tt>PF_IO_WORKER</tt> threads are used by
io_uring for operations that might block; 
he followed up the bug report with two patch sets that would hide these
threads in various ways.
The idea behind hiding them is that if GDB cannot
see the threads, it will not attempt 
to attach to them.  Prior to&nbsp;5.12, the threads existed but were not
associated with the io_uring-using process, so GDB would not see them.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, less than desirable for developers to be unable to run
a debugger on code that uses io_uring, especially since io_uring
support in their application is likely to be relatively new, thus it may need more in the way of
debugging.  The maintainer of the io_uring subsystem, Jens Axboe, quickly
stepped in to help Metzmacher solve the problem. Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210320153832.1033687-1-axboe%40kernel.dk/">posted</a>
a patch set that included a way to hide the <tt>PF_IO_WORKER</tt> threads, along with
some tweaks to the signal handling for these threads;
in particular, he removed the ability for them to receive signals at all.
</p>

<p>
That made Eric W. Biederman somewhat uncomfortable; he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/m1eeg9bxyi.fsf@fess.ebiederm.org/">asked</a> why the
io_uring threads could not take signals, and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/m1sg4paj8h.fsf@fess.ebiederm.org/"><tt>SIGSTOP</tt> in
particular</a>.  In order to attach to a running process, <tt>ptrace()</tt>
uses <tt>SIGSTOP</tt>, but the I/O threads lack much of the normal
user-space context that would allow handling signals.
Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjLMy+J20ZSBec4iarw2NeSu5sWXm6wdMH59n-e0Qe06g@mail.gmail.com/">explained</a>
that signal handling is done when a thread returns to user space, but that
does not happen for kernel threads; he 
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whyL6prwWR0GdgxLZm_w-QWwo7jPw_DkEGYFbMeCdo8YQ@mail.gmail.com/">described</a>
that further in another message:
<blockquote class="bq">
SIGSTOP handling is fundamentally done at signal handling time, and
signal handling is fundamentally done at "return to user space" time.
<p>
End result: you cannot send kernel threads any signals at all, unless
it _explicitly_ handles them manually.  SIGSTOP isn't different from
user space delivery of an "actual" signal handler in this respect.
<p>
And practically speaking, the only signal a kernel thread generally
can handle is SIGKILL (and exit on it).
<p>
[...] I really think IO threads need to not participate, because they simply
cannot handle signals in any sane manner.
</blockquote>

<p>
A few days later, 
Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210325164343.807498-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">posted</a>
another version of the patch set with a longer description of the problem
and the proposed solution:
<blockquote class="bq">
Stefan reports that attaching to a task with io_uring will leave gdb
very confused and just repeatedly attempting to attach to the IO threads,
even though it receives an -EPERM every time. This patchset proposes to
skip PF_IO_WORKER threads as same_thread_group(), except for accounting
purposes which we still desire.
<p>
We also skip listing the IO threads in /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/task/ so that gdb
doesn't think it should stop and attach to them. This makes us consistent
with earlier kernels, where these async threads were not related to the
ring owning task, and hence gdb (and others) ignored them anyway.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
But it seems those patches went a bit too far; Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/m1ft0j3u5k.fsf@fess.ebiederm.org/">pointed out</a>
that the threads would no longer show up in <tt>/proc</tt> at all, which
would hide them from <tt>top</tt> and other diagnostic tools.  Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjOXiEAjGLbn2mWRsxqpAYUPcwCj2x5WgEAh=gj+o0t4Q@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>
that it also hides them from <tt>ps</tt>, which makes him "<q>think that
hiding them is the wrong model</q>". 
There was some <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wg1XpX=iAv=1HCUReMbEgeN5UogZ4_tbi+ehaHZG6d==g@mail.gmail.com/">discussion</a>
of putting the threads under a different name in the <tt>/proc</tt>
hierarchy, but Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/3a1c02a5-db6d-e3e1-6ff5-69dd7cd61258@kernel.dk/">thought</a>
it might work for some utilities but would likely "<q>mess up
_something_</q>".  Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/m1zgyr2ddh.fsf@fess.ebiederm.org/">said</a> that
there needed to be some mechanism to tell GDB (and other debuggers) that
these threads are special: "<q>I suspect getting -EPERM (or possibly a
different error code) when 
attempting attach is the right [way] to know that a thread is not
available to be debugged.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Axboe mentioned in the patch cover letter that the underlying problem might
really be a GDB bug and Biederman seemed to agree, but
Oleg Nesterov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210325204014.GD28349@redhat.com/">took
exception</a> to that:
"<q>The kernel changed the rules, and this 
broke gdb.</q>"  But Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/m135wj0xj8.fsf@fess.ebiederm.org/">argued</a> that
it was not strictly a regression; "<q>It is gdb not
handling new functionality.</q>"  Though, even if it was a GDB bug, Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/27a54fc2-865a-d90b-2429-d91170be5873@kernel.dk/">said</a>,
it simply takes too long for updates to GDB to make their way to users to
fix things that way; beyond that,
"<q>I doubt that gdb is the only thing 
that'd fall over, not expecting threads in there that it cannot attach
to.</q>"
</p>

<p>
So, some kind of solution where everything "just works" was desired—and
that is seemingly exactly what Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgUcVeaKhtBgJO3TfE69miJq-krtL8r_Wf_=LBTJw6WSg@mail.gmail.com/">came
up with</a>:
<blockquote class="bq">
Actually, maybe the right model is to simply make all the io threads
take signals, and get rid of all the special cases.
<p>
Sure, the signals will never be delivered to user space, but if we
<ul class="spacylist">
 <li>just made the thread loop do "get_signal()" when there are pending signals

 <li>allowed ptrace_attach on them
</ul>
<p>
they'd look pretty much like regular threads that just never do the
user-space part of signal handling.
<p>
The whole "signals are very special for IO threads" thing has caused
so many problems, that maybe the solution is simply to _not_ make them
special?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ad21da2b-01ea-e77c-70b2-0401059e322b@kernel.dk/">agreed</a>
that it made more sense to "<q>just
embrace the signals, and have everything just work by default</q>".  To
that end, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f9bc0bac-2ad9-827e-7360-099e1e310df5@kernel.dk/">tried</a>
attaching GDB after making changes along those lines and was successful.
That led to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210326003928.978750-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">version&nbsp;1</a>
of the "<q>allow signals for IO threads</q>" patch set

on March&nbsp;25 and, after a few fixes, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210326155128.1057078-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">version&nbsp;2</a>
on March&nbsp;26.  The latter was promptly <a
href="/Articles/850986/">picked up for 5.12-rc5</a> on March&nbsp;28; it
also reverts some of the earlier attempts at fixes that had been picked up for 5.12-rc4 a
week earlier.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that the I/O threads simply take signals like other threads and
processes rather than be a special case, which cleans things up
substantially.  As Axboe put it in the cover letter of the first version, it is
plain to see in
hindsight:
<blockquote class="bq">
As with most other good ideas, it's
obvious once you hear it. The fact that we end up with _zero_ special
cases with this is a clear sign that this is the right way to do it
indeed. The fact that this series is 2/3rds revert further drives that
point home.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In the end, it would seem that a much better solution came about; at least
in part by Torvalds stepping back and reconsidering some of the
assumptions.  While <tt>PF_IO_WORKER</tt> threads cannot really do anything
with signals that get sent to them, there is no real need to reject them
either.  Once that was recognized, the patches were fairly straightforward
it seems.  And, meanwhile, an unpleasant situation for developers of
io_uring-using code was avoided.

Suppose that userland has enqueued a large number of operations into the io_uring queue, and you send SIGSTOP to the process.<br>
<p>
Presumably it won&#x27;t freeze any operations that have already been dequeued and are in progress.  But with this change in place, will the kernel eventually stop dequeueing *new* operations?  Or will it just ignore the signal?<br>

It&#x27;s my understanding that the signals effectively just are ignored. The article says that signals are processed at the userspace boundary - which these threads never reach.... <br>

The I/O worker when it reaches the top level of it&#x27;s loops and processes signals it will join in the stop of the entire process.<br>
<p>
No additional work will be dequeued.<br>
<p>
<p>
Signals with signal handlers must be processed by modifying the userspace process to execute the handlers.<br>
<p>
STOP signals and fatal signals without handlers (such as SIGKILL and SIGSTOP) are processed without<br>
returning to userspace.  So the io workers can and do process then whenever they check for signals.<br>

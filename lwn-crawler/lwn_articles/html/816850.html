<p>
The <a href="/Articles/793253/">first</a> installment of the
"big bad" series described how a compiler can optimize your concurrent
program into oblivion, while the <a
href="/Articles/799218/">second</a> installment introduced
a tool to analyze small litmus tests for such problems.  Those two
articles can be especially helpful for training, design
discussions, and checking small samples of code.  Although such
automated training and design tools are welcome, automated code
inspection that could locate even one class of concurrency bugs would be
even better.  In this two-part article, we look at a tool to do that kind
of analysis.

<p>
This article focuses on the <a
href="https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/KCSAN">Kernel Concurrency
Sanitizer</a> (KCSAN)—also covered in an earlier <a
href="/Articles/802128/">LWN article</a>—which can locate
data races across the entire Linux kernel. This wide scalability does not
come for free: KCSAN relies on compiler instrumentation and performs its
analysis at runtime, which slows down the kernel considerably. In addition,
it can only report data races that actually happen or almost happen during
code execution.
Nevertheless, KCSAN has already pointed out
numerous problems, many of which have now been <a
href="https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/KCSAN#upstream-fixes-of-data-races-found-by-kcsan">fixed</a>. 

<p> Although KCSAN follows the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt">Linux-Kernel
Memory Consistency Model</a> (LKMM), KCSAN can be told to ignore certain
classes of data races depending on the preferences
of the developers and maintainers, as will be described in
part&nbsp;2. Such forgiveness is helpful to 
developers who wish to focus on data races that are not exacerbated by
current compilers. Furthermore, KCSAN allows developers to specify certain
types of concurrency rules that it also checks for. In this mode KCSAN acts
as a thorough concurrency-aware code reviewer, thus providing a
much-needed service to the kernel community.

<a name="Why should we care about data races?"></a>
<h4>Why care about data races?</h4>

<p> The C language evolved independently of concurrency. Consequently,
C compilers are permitted to assume that if there is nothing special about a
given variable or access, the variable will change only in response to a
store by the current thread. Compilers therefore can and do use a variety
of optimizations involving load fusing, code reordering, and many
others—described in the first installment—that can cause
concurrent algorithms to malfunction.
 
<p> By <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt#n1922">definition</a>,
data races occur when there are concurrent conflicting accesses from
multiple threads (or tasks or CPUs), at least one of which is a plain
(unmarked) C-language access; accesses conflict if  they all access the
same memory location and at least one performs a
write. While KCSAN can enforce that strict definition, by default it treats
all aligned writes up to word size, whether marked or not, as atomic, so it is only looking for
unmarked reads that race with those writes.

<p>
The wide variety of
optimizations used by modern compilers makes it extremely difficult to
predict all possible outcomes for all compilers on all architectures.
Worse yet, long experience indicates that optimizers will continue becoming
increasingly aggressive. In fact, the C11
memory consistency model (described in section 5.1.2.4 of this <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2478.pdf">specification
[PDF]</a>) allows maximal optimizer aggression by stating
that data races invoke undefined behavior.</p>

<div class="tlr">
<a name="qq1"></a><b>Quick quiz 1</b>:
Why can't the Linux kernel just use the C11 memory model?
<br><a href="#qq1answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p> For code that does not follow the C11 memory model, the situation is
even less clear.  In the case of the Linux kernel, the LKMM specifies the
expected behavior of concurrent kernel code given production compilers and
systems. To this end, LKMM relies on special marked operations
(<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, etc.) that tell the compiler
which accesses are expected to race, thus preventing the compiler from
applying harmful optimizations. For a summary please see the second
installment in the series, "Calibrating your fear of big bad
optimizing compilers".</p>

<div class="tlr">
<a name="qq2"></a><b>Quick quiz 2</b>:
What's the difference between "data races" and "race conditions"?
<br><a href="#qq2answer">Answer</a>
	</div>

<p>
However, if a data race results in unexpected system behavior then this
data race is also a race-condition bug, and it is likely to also be a
symptom of a bug in the system's higher-level logic. One common example of
such a bug is access to lock-protected shared variables from threads that
have failed to acquire the corresponding lock. Developers and maintainers
who have appropriately marked their accesses to shared variables will find
that KCSAN's reports point to such logic bugs. Furthermore, KCSAN
allows developers some control over the warnings issued, which in turn
allows those developers to focus KCSAN's automated review on the race
conditions of interest.

<a name="The Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer"></a>
<h4>The Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer</h4>

<p>
KCSAN is a tool that detects data races as defined by the LKMM, but with
control over exactly what sorts of data races are reported. KCSAN is aware
of all marked atomic operations that the LKMM defines, as well as
operations not yet mentioned by the LKMM, such as <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.5/core-api/atomic_ops.html#atomic-bitmask">atomic
bitmask operations</a>. KCSAN also extends the LKMM, for example by providing
the <tt>data_race()</tt> marking, which denotes intentional data races and
a possible lack of atomicity. 

<p>
KCSAN is nothing more or less than a way of carrying out an extremely
detailed automated concurrency-aware code inspection. In this way, KCSAN
augments the "10,000 eyes" with a set of eyes that do not get tired, and
which has been running continuously on a <a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md">syzbot</a> instance since
October&nbsp;2019. To get a peek at some of the data races being found, without
having to run KCSAN yourself, have a look at this <a
href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream?manager=ci2-upstream-kcsan-gce">dashboard</a>. 

<p>
KCSAN relies on observing that two accesses happen concurrently. Crucially,
there is a desire to (a) increase the chances of observing races (especially for
races that manifest rarely), and (b) be able to actually observe
them. Those things can be accomplished (a) by injecting various delays, and (b) by using address
watchpoints (or breakpoints). 

<p>
If memory accesses are deliberately stalled, while a watchpoint is active for
that address, then if the watchpoint is observed to fire, two accesses
to the same address just raced.  This is the
approach taken in <a
href="http://usenix.org/legacy/events/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Erickson.pdf">DataCollider
[PDF]</a> using hardware watchpoints.
KCSAN does not use hardware watchpoints, but instead relies on compiler
instrumentation and "soft watchpoints". 

<p>
In KCSAN, watchpoints are implemented using an efficient encoding that
stores access type, size, and address in a long integer; the benefits of using
"soft watchpoints" are portability and greater flexibility. KCSAN then
relies on the compiler instrumenting plain memory accesses. For each
instrumented plain access, KCSAN will: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Check if a matching watchpoint exists; if yes, and at least one
	access is a write, then a racing access has been encountered.</li> 

	<li>Periodically, if no matching watchpoint exists, set up a
	watchpoint and stall for a small randomized delay.</li> 

	<li>Also check the data value before the delay, and re-check the
	data value after delay; if the values mismatch, a race of
	unknown origin is inferred.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
To detect data races where some (but not all) accesses have been marked
with an annotation like <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, KCSAN also
instruments marked accesses, but only to check if a watchpoint exists;
i.e. KCSAN never sets up a watchpoint on marked accesses. So if all accesses to a variable that is
accessed concurrently are properly marked, KCSAN will never trigger a
watchpoint, since it never set one up, and therefore will never report the accesses. 

<a name="How to use KCSAN?"></a>
<h4>How to use KCSAN</h4>

<p>
The best use of KCSAN depends on the maintainers, developers, and the code
in question. This section covers different classes of code and how KCSAN
can best help find potential concurrency bugs, then looks at ways of
organizing KCSAN reports. 
But if you remember only one thing from this section, let it be "Do NOT
respond to KCSAN reports by mindlessly adding <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>,
<tt>data_race()</tt>, and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>."  The following sections (and part&nbsp;2)
will give a few reasons why this rule is so important. 

<p>
Recent Linux installations provide everything needed to build the 
kernel with KCSAN, though KCSAN itself has not been merged to the mainline
as yet; it is available in linux-next at this point. A compiler upgrade is required for older Linux
installations with GCC prior to version 7.3.0 or with Clang prior to
version 7.0.0. 
Given a KCSAN-capable compiler, running your kernel built with
<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN=y</tt> might result in the following report: 

<pre>
    ==================================================================
    BUG: KCSAN: data-race in rcu_torture_reader / run_timer_softirq

     ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40

    Reported by Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer on:
    ...
    ==================================================================
</pre>

<p>
This shows an eight-byte data race between the functions
<tt>rcu_torture_reader()</tt> and <tt>run_timer_softirq()</tt>, with
<tt>rcu_torture_reader()</tt> having done a marked read ("<tt>read (marked)
to ...</tt>") and <tt>run_timer_softirq()</tt> having done an unmarked write
("<tt>write to ...</tt>"), which by the strict LKMM definition constitutes a
data race. 

<p>
However, in this case, the data race is not immediately apparent from the
source code of these two functions.  One approach would be to attempt to
work out which data structure resides at address <tt>0xffff9ea500543e98</tt>
and another approach is to examine the assembly language at
<tt>rcu_torture_reader+0x2cb</tt> and <tt>run_timer_softirq+0x63c</tt>.
However, both of these time-honored approaches are labor-intensive and
uncertain, not least due to the aggressive inlining and code-motion
optimizations practiced by today's compilers. 

<p>
A much nicer approach is to build your kernel with
<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y</tt>, thus providing debug information that can be
used by a variety of tools, for example, <tt>gdb</tt> (alternatives to
<tt>gdb</tt> include <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh"><tt>scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh</tt></a>
and <a 
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/tree/master/tools/syz-symbolize"><tt>syz-symbolize</tt></a>):  

<pre>
    (gdb) l*rcu_torture_reader+0x2cb
    0xffffffff8114a2bb is in rcu_torture_reader (./include/linux/list.h:784).
    779      * to avoid potential load-tearing.  The READ_ONCE() is paired with the
    780      * various WRITE_ONCE() in hlist helpers that are defined below.
    781      */
    782     static inline int hlist_unhashed_lockless(const struct hlist_node *h)
    783     {
    784             return !READ_ONCE(h-&gt;pprev);
    785     }
    786
    787     /**
    788      * hlist_empty - Is the specified hlist_head structure an empty hlist
</pre>

<p>
The first of the conflicting accesses is the <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> in
<tt>hlist_unhashed_lockless()</tt>, which was apparently inlined into
<tt>rcu_torture_reader()</tt>.  This fact might have been difficult to
glean from the assembly language.  Given this information, the location of
the other conflicting access is unsurprising: 

<pre>
    (gdb) l*run_timer_softirq+0x63c
    0xffffffff81169aec is in run_timer_softirq (./include/linux/list.h:931).
    926     static inline void hlist_move_list(struct hlist_head *old,
    927                                        struct hlist_head *new)
    928     {
    929             new-&gt;first = old-&gt;first;
    930             if (new-&gt;first)
    931                     new-&gt;first-&gt;pprev = &amp;new-&gt;first;
    932             old-&gt;first = NULL;
    933     }
    934
    935     #define hlist_entry(ptr, type, member) container_of(ptr,type,member)
</pre>

<p>
The unmarked write on line 931 is the conflicting access, again according
to the strict LKMM definition of data race.  However, a kernel built with
the default KCSAN <tt>Kconfig</tt> options would not report this data race
because unmarked writes are considered to be atomic.
By default, and at a high level, KCSAN looks for unmarked
	reads that run concurrently with any sort of write to that
	same variable. This is less strict than LKMM, which would in addition look for
	unmarked writes that run concurrently with any sort of read from
	or write to that same variable.
If you want reports
according to the strict LKMM definition (as Paul McKenney does when applying KCSAN
to RCU), build your kernel with the following additional
<tt>Kconfig</tt> options: 

<pre>
    CONFIG_KCSAN_ASSUME_PLAIN_WRITES_ATOMIC=n
    CONFIG_KCSAN_REPORT_VALUE_CHANGE_ONLY=n
    CONFIG_KCSAN_INTERRUPT_WATCHER=y
</pre>

These options are discussed in more detail in part&nbsp;2. A summary
of various options is also available in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/Documentation/dev-tools/kcsan.rst"><tt>Documentation/dev-tools/kcsan.rst</tt></a>.

<a name="Summarizing KCSAN Reports"></a>
<h4>Summarizing KCSAN reports</h4>

<p>
It is not unusual for a moderate-length test to produce thousands of KCSAN
reports, which does not necessarily generate enthusiasm for working on
fixes.  However, most of these reports will be duplicates.  One way to
reduce the number of duplicates is to build your kernel with KCSAN's
<tt>KCSAN_REPORT_ONCE_IN_MS</tt> <tt>Kconfig</tt> parameter set to a large
value.  For example, building with
<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_REPORT_ONCE_IN_MS=10000</tt> will collapse any duplicate
reports that occur within a ten-second interval.  This can greatly reduce
the number of duplicates from a given run; for example, on a 90-minute
TREE05 rcutorture scenario, using this <tt>Kconfig</tt> option value reduced the
number of KCSAN reports from 6,413 to 3,050. 

<p>
However, by default rcutorture runs 16 scenarios, ten of which are SMP,
thus potentially producing KCSAN diagnostics.  It is sometimes useful to
collapse the reports from all of these scenarios and summarize them by function
names, for example, using a script like the following: 

<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    grep "BUG: KCSAN: " "$@" | \
            sed -e 's/^\[[^]]*] //' | \
            sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr
</pre>

<p>
Given the console logs ("<tt>$@</tt>" above) collected during an rcutorture
run in which each scenario ran for 90 minutes, this script reduced 29,312
KCSAN reports to only 56 lines of output.  This is a much more manageable
number of reports.  Of course, much detail is lost, but this detail can be
recaptured by searching the console output for the KCSAN reports of
interest. 

<p>
By default, KCSAN operates globally, which means that only a small fraction
of the reports will normally pertain to the subsystem at hand.  In general,
it is quite difficult to identify which reports pertain to which subsystem
due to inlining and the possibility that a report in a called
function is because of the failure of the caller to provide proper
synchronization. One of the following approaches might be useful: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Deduplicate as discussed above, and then look at one report
	from each of the resulting categories.  This works well, though it
	can miss cases where a pair of functions have data races on more
	than one variable.</li> 

	<li>Deduplicate as discussed above, but look only at reports from
	categories containing a function defined in the subsystem at hand.
	This works best when there are a large number of reports even after
	deduplication, but risks missing important reports due to
	inlining.</li> 

	<li>Decode the stack traces (for example, using
	<tt>scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh</tt> or <tt>syz-symbolize</tt>),
	and look at any report having a stack trace containing a function
	defined in the subsystem at hand.  This is the most thorough
	approach, but can require looking into a huge number of
	reports.</li> 

	<li>If only a specific set of known functions defined in the
	subsystem at hand are of interest, it is possible to tell KCSAN to
	only report races in those at runtime using its whitelist
	feature.  The next section discusses this in
	more detail.</li> 
</ul>

<a name="Interacting with KCSAN at Runtime"></a>
<h4>Interacting with KCSAN at runtime</h4>

<p>
It is possible to control KCSAN at runtime, which can help to respond to
changes in workload or debugging aims by tweaking KCSAN's parameters and by
controlling which data races are reported. 

<p>
 The file <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcsan</tt>
provides the following interface to KCSAN: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Reading <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcsan</tt> returns various
	runtime statistics, such as the number of data races detected.</li> 

	<li>Writing "on" or "off" to <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcsan</tt>
	allows turning KCSAN on or off, respectively.</li> 

	<li>Writing <tt>!some_func_name</tt> to
	<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcsan</tt> adds <tt>some_func_name</tt> to
	the report filter list, which (by default) blacklists reporting
	data races where either one of the top stack frames are a function
	in the list.</li> 

	<li>Writing either <tt>blacklist</tt> or <tt>whitelist</tt> to
	<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcsan</tt> changes the report filtering
	behavior. For example, the blacklist feature can be used to
	silence frequently occurring data races; the whitelist feature can
	help with reproduction and testing of fixes.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The default configuration parameters are chosen
to be conservative, providing overall good performance and race-detection
abilities on smaller systems (desktops, workstations, virtual
machines). However, large systems, such as servers with more than 64
hardware threads, may require adjustment. 

<p>
The core parameters that affect KCSAN's overall performance and bug
detection ability are exposed as kernel command-line arguments whose
defaults can also be changed via the corresponding <tt>Kconfig</tt>
options. All of these arguments and options are related to KCSAN's
watchpoint handling.

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li><tt>kcsan.skip_watch</tt> (<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_SKIP_WATCH</tt>):
	Number of per-CPU memory operations to skip before setting up another
	watchpoint. Setting up watchpoints more frequently will
	result in the likelihood of races to be observed to increase. This
	parameter has the most significant impact on overall system
	performance and race detection ability.</li> 

	<li><tt>kcsan.udelay_task</tt> (<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_UDELAY_TASK</tt>):
	For tasks, the microsecond delay to stall execution after a
	watchpoint has been set up. Larger values increase the window in
	which a race may be observed.</li> 

	<li><tt>kcsan.udelay_interrupt</tt>
	(<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_UDELAY_INTERRUPT</tt>): For interrupts, the
	microsecond delay to stall execution after a watchpoint has been
	set up. Interrupts have tighter latency requirements, and their
	delay should generally be smaller than the one chosen for
	tasks.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
On a new system, one may either set the corresponding <tt>Kconfig</tt>
option or set them as a boot parameters. For example, on a large
system with 64 hardware threads, we would recommend starting with
<tt>kcsan.skip_watch=64000</tt>. Then, once the system has booted, the
parameter can be tweaked further via
<tt>/sys/module/kcsan/parameters/skip_watch</tt>. 

<h4>Next up</h4>

<p>
This part has provided an overview of the basic usage of KCSAN and ideas on
how to apply it to find data races.
In part 2, we will look deeper into KCSAN and how it can be used on various
types of code.  It will also cover using KCSAN in looking at other types of
problems, beyond just those governed by the LKMM.  Some strategies,
alternative approaches, and known limitations will be covered as well.

<h4>Answers to quick quizzes</h4>

<b>Quick quiz 1</b>:
Why can't the Linux kernel just use the C11 memory model?
</p>
	<p>
	<b>Answer:</b> In many cases, the kernel's requirements <a
	href="/Articles/691128/">cannot easily be cast</a>
	into the C11
	memory model. While for some parts of the kernel, it could be
	conceivable to do so, the engineering efforts and resulting
	inconsistencies make this proposition unattractive today. Note
	that, the LKMM is still defined at the C-language level, and
	embedded in the variant of C that the Linux kernel uses today.

<b>Quick quiz 2</b>:
What's the difference between "data races" and "race conditions"?

<p>
	<b>Answer:</b> Race conditions occur if concurrently executing
	operations result in unexpected system behavior. On the other
	hand, data races are <a
	href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt#n1922">defined</a>
	at the C-language level. Data races can manifest as race-condition
	bugs either through compiler transformations, or if the high-level
	logic of the code is buggy to begin with (such as failing to
	acquire a lock). 

	<p>
	However, not all race conditions are data races, for example if a
	racing access is incorrectly marked (how KCSAN can also find these
	is discussed in part&nbsp;2). For a moment, imagine that we marked every
	memory access: at this point, there are no more data races and no
	more KCSAN complaints.  However, we may still have race conditions,
	many of which, such as failing to acquire the necessary locks, can
	cause the system to misbehave despite the lack of KCSAN
	complaints. 

	<p>
	Also note that, not all references to "race conditions" imply buggy
	behavior. Many low-level synchronization mechanisms are meant to
	resolve race conditions; for example, the reads in race conditions
	due to unsuccessful sequence-lock reader critical sections will
	simply be discarded and retried. However, most <a
	href="http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/paradyn/papers/what-are-races.pdf">definitions</a>
	and uses of "race condition" imply buggy behavior; unless
	otherwise specified, our use of "race condition" follows this
	notion.

<h1>Kernel headers and user space</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted November 30, 2004 by corbet]

The use of kernel headers in user space has long been discouraged.  The
kernel headers are not written with user space in mind, and they can change
at any time.  The proper way for user-space applications to interface with
the kernel is by way of the C library, which provides its own structures
and, when necessary, translates them into whatever the current kernel
expects.  This separation helps to keep user-space programs from breaking
when the kernel changes.
<p>

Unfortunately, things do not always work that way, and some user-space
programs still end up including kernel headers directly.  These programs
may simply be old, or they may need access to declarations which are not
available in the C library include files - strange <tt>ioctl()</tt> codes,
for example.  So the kernel code still tries to make it possible for user
space to include some header files.  In these files, kernel-specific code
is contained within <tt>#ifdef&nbsp;__KERNEL__</tt> blocks and hidden from
user space.  This technique works, but it is brittle and adds extra cruft
to the kernel code base.  Intermixing internal kernel definitions with
those needed by user space also makes it easy to break the user-space API.
<p>

The kernel developers have, for years, wanted to improve this situation.  The
latest attempt came in the form of <a href="/Articles/113006/">this RFC</a>
from David Howells.  This proposal would create some new directories in the
kernel source tree: <tt>include/user</tt> and some architecture-specific
variations (such as <tt>include/user-i386</tt>).  When a portion of a
kernel header file is found to be needed by user space, it would be placed
into a separate file in one of those directories, and the new file would be
included into the old one.  At this point, the definitions needed by user
space will have been separated out, but no visible changes will have been
made; user space can still include the old file and get what it needs.
<p>

At some future point, when user space is deemed to have been fixed, all of
the <tt>__KERNEL__</tt> references could be removed from the old files.  At
that point, any application still including the internal header files would
break. 
<p>

One part of the idea which did not get very far was using standard C types
(such as <tt>uint16_t</tt> and such) for the user-kernel interface.  The
problem with that idea is that the kernel cannot count on those types being
consistently defined for all configurations, and cannot create its own
definitions for the standard types.  So the kernel/user interface must
continue to be defined using kernel-specific types (<tt>__u16</tt> and
such).
<p>

Linus was <a href="/Articles/113367/">not all that enthusiastic</a> about
the idea in general.  To him, it looks like an exercise in rearranging
things without specific goals and with the possibility of breaking things
which work now:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We undeniably have existing users of kernel headers. That's just a
	fact.  If we break them, it doesn't _matter_ how the kernel headers
	look, and then "existing practice" is about as good an organization
	as anything, and breaking things just to break things is not
	something I'm in the least interested in. "Beauty" comes secondary
	to "usefulness".
</div>
<p>

What he would like to see is more specific discussions which identify
specific, problematic header files and what will be done to fix them.  In
the end, the header files might just get split up in the way described by
Mr. Howells.  It is more likely to happen as a long and slow process,
however, and not as a massive, coordinated reorganization.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>I hate ifdef __KERNEL__.  But I hate even more the proposition that a user space program should not include a kernel header file.  The C library is itself a user space program, so the rule that a user space program has to go through the C library obviously isn't logical.  And the GNU C library is an optional tool, not an official part of the kernel interface (if it were the latter, I would expect to see it packaged with the kernel).
<p>
It's common practice in C programming to declare as much of an interface as possible in a header file and have the code at both ends of the interface use the same file to ensure that they agree on the interface.  That Linux has never had an identifiable set of interface header files to declare its system call interface seems to me to be a major engineering weakness.
<p>
I thought Howell's proposal was a natural.

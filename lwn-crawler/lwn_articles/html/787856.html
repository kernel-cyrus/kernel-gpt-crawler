<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 9, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
The 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit differed
somewhat from its predecessors in that it contained a fourth track
dedicated to the BPF virtual machine.  LWN was unable to attend most of
those sessions, but a couple of BPF-related talks were a part of the
broader program.  Among those was a plenary talk by Dave Miller, described
as "a wholistic view" of why BPF is successful, its current state, and
where things are going.
<p>
Years ago, Miller began, Alexei Starovoitov showed up at a netfilter
conference promoting his ideas for extending BPF.  He described how it
could be used to efficiently implement various types of switching fabric —
<i>any</i> type, in fact.  Miller said that he didn't understand the power
of this idea until quite a bit later.
<p>
<h4>What's good now</h4>
<p>
BPF, he said, is well defined and useful, solving real problems and
allowing users to do what they want with their systems.  It is increasingly
possible to look at what is going on inside the kernel or to modify its
behavior without having to change the source or reboot the system.  BPF
provides strict limits on what programs can do, running them inside the
kernel but in a sandboxed mode.  BPF programs operate on a specific

<a href="/Articles/787859/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/DaveMiller-sm.jpg" alt="[Dave Miller]"
title="Dave Miller" class="rthumb"></a>

object (called the "context"), and there are many places to attach them.
They execute in finite time; something that is assured because
they are not currently allowed to contain loops (though that will change to
some extent eventually).  BPF maps provide data structures for programs and
can be used to share access to data.
<p>
The BPF verifier, Miller said, is "the only thing between us and extreme
peril".  It is the last line of defense preventing dangerous code from
getting into the system.  It is so good, he said, that it often frustrates
BPF authors, who have to massage their programs to get them to a point
where the verifier will accept them.
<p>
The real value of BPF lies in the fact that "we are all arrogant".  System
designers tend to think that they know what their users want to do, so they
make boxes to enable that one thing.  But users don't want to be in a box;
those users
are a constant source of new ideas, and developers often don't know what they
want.  BPF allows users to escape the box created by system designers, who
may be sad about that, but they'll get over it.
<p>
BPF has been growing slowly, by word of mouth, Miller said, because there
is no "advertising machine" for this technology.  Users are still learning
about it.  The good news is that, once technical people get into a new
technology, they tend to spread it around.  That has happened with BPF, to
the point that people are now writing books about it.
<p>
<h4>What's improving</h4>
<p>
BPF is mostly useful now for solving simple problems, Miller said, but it
is rapidly gaining the ability to deal with "real programs".  One step in
that direction is increasing the size limit for BPF programs from its
current value of 4096 instructions to 1&nbsp;million.  The prohibition on
loops forces 
developers to unroll loops in their programs, which is unfortunate; the
in-development <a 
href="/Articles/773605/">support for bounded loops</a> will fix that
problem someday.
<p>
BPF programs can perform tail calls now; they function a lot like
continuations.  Tail calls are a great way to build an execution pipeline,
where each step in the pipeline performs a tail call to the next.  But now
BPF is able to support real function calls as well, but a given program
still cannot use both due to limitations in the verifier.
<p>
One area where BPF has seen some improvement is introspection; it can be
hard for developers to understand why their program is not doing what they
want.  Indeed, in current kernels, it's hard even to determine which BPF
programs have been loaded into the system, or to verify that a loaded
program is the one that is wanted.  The <tt>bpftool</tt> utility is
improving in its introspection support, as is the BTF format for describing
data types, which will help to <a href="/Articles/773198/">increase
the portability</a> of BPF programs.  BTF turns out to be good for
annotating BPF programs and how they work.  The <tt>perf</tt> utility is
also gaining the ability to drill down into BPF programs.  Users cannot
complain, Miller said, that visibility into BPF is not being provided.
<p>
<h4>What's needed</h4>
<p>
There is no shortage of opportunities for improvement still, he said.  For
example, BPF does not currently support code reuse all that well; there are
a lot of people out there writing their own Ethernet header parsers.  There are
systems with thousands of redundant BPF programs loaded into them; that is
not the way to do software development.  Support for function calls will
help, but BPF needs libraries, and it will need access control for those
libraries once 
they can be loaded.  BTF will help, since it will make it easy to see
which libraries are available in a given system.
<p>
BPF development is still harder in general than it should be; Miller would
like to see the development of a "type and go" environment that makes
writing and loading a BPF program as easy as on the Arduino.  Unskilled
people should be able to get stuff done; that is part of the goal of
wresting control away from arrogant system developers.
<p>
BPF programs should have "trivial debuggability", he continued.  It should
be possible to single-step through programs and examine context data.  He
would like the ability to record a program's execution or state so that it
could be stepped through outside of the kernel.  Perhaps even live,
in-kernel single-stepping could be supported in development environments.
The most important thing for the near future, though, is the ability to
snapshot the current state of a BPF program.
<p>
Finally, he said, BPF needs better access control.  Almost all BPF
functionality is root-only now, but things will not be that way forever.
Much more granular control to BPF functionality is required — or we could
always control access to BPF with a BPF program, he said.  A file like
<tt>/dev/bpf</tt> could be used for access control, but that's still pretty
coarse; perhaps what is needed is a hierarchy of files describing the
different program types and their access permissions.  BPF also needs
better memory accounting, since maps can get quite large.
<p>
At this point, Miller concluded his talk and accepted questions.  Matthew
Wilcox started things off by saying that he will not be impressed by BPF
until it becomes possible to play <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a> in the kernel.  The
original Zork was less than 1&nbsp;million instructions, Wilcox said, so
that should be possible.
<p>
<h4>ABI compatibility</h4>
<p>
The first actual question was about whether there are any inherent limits
on what BPF will 
eventually be able to do.  Early on, Miller answered, it was used for tasks
like packet analysis, and current usage still reflects that.  BPF will not
be usable to implement a proprietary TCP stack in the kernel, for example;
that is not a goal.  Among other things, there are no timers available to
BPF programs and no plans to add them.
<p>
Some people do try to push the limits, Miller said.  Steve Hemminger tried
to convert a packet scheduler to BPF, for example, but eventually ran into
the timer issue.  Somebody else, though, managed to create a complete
implementation of OpenVSwitch, but that sort of project really misses the
point of BPF.  The real value is not in doing everything, but in being able
to do exactly what you need and no more.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that he did not expect to see device drivers in BPF, but
Miller responded that those already exist.  He was referring to the ability
to <a href="/Articles/759188/">perform infrared protocol decoding</a> in a
BPF program.  That eliminates the need to support hundreds of infrared
devices in a kernel driver and allows support for new devices to be easily
added to older kernels.  Ts'o conceded that point, but said that it was
unlikely that there would be an NVIDIA GPU driver written in BPF anytime
soon.
<p>
Another attendee asked about ABI compatibility; will the kernel have to
support existing BPF programs forever?  Miller responded that BPF exists in
an "ambiguous plane" between kernel ABI and the "wild west" of the kernel's
internals.  Tools like BTF will help to make things more compatible over
time.  Meanwhile, the BPF developers have taken liberties to break things
in the early stages; the community is still learning how all of this stuff
should work.  But that should happen less often over time.  That said,
he doesn't think it will ever be possible to write a BPF program and expect
that it will work on every future kernel.
<p>
The discussion turned to the <a href="/Articles/442113/"><tt>powertop</tt>
episode</a>, where a change to a tracepoint broke the <tt>powertop</tt> utility and
had to be reverted.  As a result of that, some maintainers still refuse to
allow the addition of tracepoints in their subsystems.  The problem is that
<tt>powertop</tt> was useful, so users complained when it broke.  BPF programs, too,
will be useful, and are likely to suffer from the same problems.  Brendan
Gregg may have <a href="/Articles/787131/">said</a> earlier in the week
that occasional breakage was OK, but someday some user will complain and
Linus Torvalds will revert a BPF-visible change.  Miller responded that,
whenever a 
new facility like this is added, there is always a period in which things
break.  We'll never get away from that, but it will get a lot better.
<p>
Ts'o worried about how bad the ABI pain would be; some BPF interfaces will
not be changeable, he said.  At least, it will not be possible to change
them without a ten-year deprecation period while old programs are fixed.
Miller said that, with BPF, users are often happy when things break,
because it usually indicates that new information is available for them to
work with.
<p>
Gregg said that, in the absence of tracepoints, current BPF tools are using
a lot of kprobes.  There are a lot of kernel-version checks that go with
them, but they still break with every kernel release.  If the kernel moves
to tracepoints that only break once every five years, that will be
fantastic.  Ts'o wondered whether the breakage of a kprobe-based tool that
is seen as being as useful as <tt>powertop</tt> would cause Torvalds to revert a
change.  He does not know the answer to that.
<p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
Dave Hansen asked about security and side channels; BPF was one way in
which the Spectre vulnerabilities could be exploited early on.  These
issues have been mitigated one at a time as they are found, but has any
thought been given to broader mitigations?  Miller acknowledged that
programs can be written to exploit speculative execution vulnerabilities;
the verifier can often detect and block such attempts.  On the other hand,
BPF can also improve security.  He mentioned an episode where a bug in a
custom hash computation could be exploited to crash the kernel; it was
possible to move the computation to BPF and block exploits until the kernel
was fixed.  Hansen continued, saying that the kernel-hardening efforts are
trying to address problems proactively; work in the BPF area, he said, is
more reactive.  Miller conceded that point, but said that, hopefully, the
kernel is becoming sufficiently hardened that it will no longer be
necessary to worry about these issues all the time.
<p>
The final question came from Ts'o, who wondered about how BPF will interact
with Linux security modules.  With the advent of <a
href="/Articles/635771/">stackable security modules</a>, it should be
possible to implement more flexible access control for BPF programs.  He
also suggested that perhaps some verifier policies should include
interaction with the security-module subsystem.
<p>
Miller answered that the verifier has a set of operations specific to each
program type; it should be possible to add a security-module hook there
somehow.  He also observed, with amusement, that SELinux is using classic
BPF now for a few things.  It would be great, he said, to use BPF to create
new security policies; it could be the "universal security policy engine".
That would allow for the immediate addition of new policies without the
need to wait for the next kernel release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

“The inputs” Hmm,  BPF programs measure in kernel state, that’s one of their main purposes.  That state changes, obviously.<br>
<p>
So this seems impossible?  Recording the full execution might work, but I think nothing short of that would be sufficient, because “the inputs” are more than what the user provides.<br>

I assume roc is thinking of <a href="https://rr-project.org/">https://rr-project.org/</a> , so "the inputs" means all data the program receives from its environment through any channel. For BPF I guess that means the initial context structure, plus the return values and BPF-memory side-effects of functions like bpf_probe_read (which copies kernel memory into BPF memory), but nothing more than that. Once you record those inputs, you should be able to deterministically replay the BPF program in a debug environment with identical behaviour.<br>
<p>
For any code that's even vaguely timing-sensitive (which I assume includes nearly everything running in a kernel that's full of timers and timeouts and hardware interfaces), that's much more useful than a debugger that pauses the program while it's running.<br>

Jon, just a note for clarification with regards to ABI compatibility: The context with regards to ""ambiguous plane" between kernel ABI and the "wild west" of the kernel's internals" is on tracing where things can occasionally break due to kprobes nature or tracepoints getting potentially removed etc etc. BTF will for example help here since structure layout can be figured out for a running kernel by a loader or verifier and therefore member offsets adjusted automatically in future to a certain degree so that a tracing program can run on different kernels without a need for recompilation. For other types like networking programs, it's the same rules as syscall ABI meaning programs will keep running on newer kernels. Perhaps this can be clarified a bit better.<br>

This is a great roundup of BPF session, that frankly i've not seen anywhere else...i'm particularly interested though in how groups like Cilium are (or aren't) contributing to help out with the missing bits...<br>

Has anyone involved got a vision for what BPF will look like in ten years? Is it going to be a full-fledged bytecode and VM for executing arbitrary code, i.e. like Webassembly with some extensions and some restricted modes? If so, in ten years are people going to be asking why both BPF and WebAssembly need to exist?<br>

Is there some reason why sysfs is not the obvious answer?   Maybe /sys/kernel/debug/bpf, or /sys/kernel/bpf?  That would certainly clarify the ABI stability question!  The solution would be to keep new BPF interfaces in staging branch until we're sure we'll keep them.<br>

Yeah, either way a hierarchy of objects instead of a device node (and then having to use ioctl to lookup an object by name or something uglier) is a much nicer model (and one could argue should have been for a lot of other kernel interfaces), as it helps to use the descriptor to select the object in question, and access control can be done through the filesystem itself.<br>

There is one thing I want added to the BPF library. <br>
<p>
I would like to have a range of user memory mapped, and directly accessible, to an eBPF program in such a way that eBPF code can initiate block writes to that memory without any permission checks or translation steps beyond a simple range check.<br>
<p>
In other words, I want to pre-clear an unlimited number of writes to a mapped user buffer. In use, this will be a multi-GB ring buffer, mapped as some thousands of hugepages. The hugepages need not appear consecutive to the eBPF code, so long as I can  learn at startup where each hugepage is mapped in user space.<br>
<p>
In actual use, the eBPF code would be executing inside the NIC, and the writes would amount to DMA operations over the PCI bus.<br>

What about a FORTRAN-style loop?<br>
<p>
For those who don't remember them, the FORTRAN spec explicitly said that the index could be kept in read-only (as far as the programmer is concerned) memory. Modifying the loop index didn't necessarily affect the loop.<br>
<p>
So a "DO II = 1 to 10" is guaranteed to execute ten times, with a monotically increasing II, even if the code inside the loop tries to modify II. (I think some implementations actually separated the loop index from the variable so the programmer could modify II but the new version wasn't used for the loop.) You could always add a statement like "SKIP II 5", which would move 5 loops closer to termination but wouldn't move backwards.<br>
<p>
That shouldn't be too hard to verify.<br>

Cheers,<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that was added to
the Linux kernel in October of 2002.
RCU improves scalability
by allowing readers to execute concurrently with writers.
In contrast, conventional locking primitives require that readers
wait for ongoing writers and vice versa.
RCU ensures read coherence by
maintaining multiple versions of data structures and ensuring that they are not
freed up until all pre-existing read-side critical sections complete.
RCU relies on efficient and scalable mechanisms for publishing
and reading new versions of an object, and also for deferring the collection
of old versions.
These mechanisms distribute the work among read and
update paths in such a way as to make read paths extremely fast. In some
cases (non-preemptable kernels), RCU's read-side primitives have zero
overhead.
RCU updates can be expensive, so RCU is in general best-suited to
read-mostly workloads.

<P>Although Classic RCU's memory footprint has been acceptable,
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/305782/">hierarchical RCU</A>
has a memory footprint that is considerably larger.
I was surprised to find that this additional memory consumption
did not greatly concern the embedded Linux people I talked to,
but then again,
I certainly do not know everyone in the embedded Linux community,
and the complexity of both
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/305782/">hierarchical RCU</A>,
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/253651/">preemptable RCU</A>,
and
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/279077/">the dynticks interface</A>
made the thought of a near-minimal kernel-capable RCU with a classic RCU
API more interesting.
In addition, a recent <a href="http://paulmck.livejournal.com/2280.html">
show of hands</a> at <a href="http://linux.conf.au">linux.conf.au</a>
indicated that there is still interest in running Linux on small-memory
single-CPU systems.
Discussions with Josh Triplett identified an attractive optimization
for the uniprocessor case, and so
&ldquo;RCU: The Bloatwatch Edition&rdquo; was born.

</p><h3><a name="Review of RCU Fundamentals">
Review of RCU Fundamentals</a></h3>

<P>This section is quite similar to its counterpart in the
description of
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/305782">hierarchical RCU</A>.
People familiar with RCU semantics may wish to proceed directly to the
<a href="#Design of Tiny RCU">next section</a>.

<P>In its most basic form, RCU is a way of waiting for things to finish.
Of course, there are a great many other ways of waiting for things to
finish, including reference counts, reader-writer locks, hashed locks,
events, and so on.
The great advantage of RCU is that it can wait for each of
(say) 20,000 different things without having to explicitly
track each and every one of them, and without having to worry about
the performance degradation, scalability limitations, complex deadlock
scenarios, and memory-leak hazards that are inherent in schemes
using explicit tracking.

<P>In RCU's case, the things waited on are called
"RCU read-side critical sections".
An RCU read-side critical section starts with an
<code>rcu_read_lock()</code> primitive, and ends with a corresponding
<code>rcu_read_unlock()</code> primitive.
RCU read-side critical sections can be nested, and may contain pretty
much any code, as long as that code does not explicitly block or sleep.
If you abide by these conventions, you can use RCU to wait for pretty
much any desired piece of code to complete.

</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 1"><b>Quick Quiz 1</b>:</a>
But what if I need my RCU read-side critical section to sleep and block?

<P>RCU accomplishes this feat by indirectly determining when these
other things have finished, as has been described elsewhere for
<A HREF="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/whatisRCU.html">
Classic RCU</A> and
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/253651/">realtime RCU</A>.

<P>In particular, as shown in the following figure, RCU is a way of
waiting for pre-existing RCU read-side critical sections to completely
finish, including memory operations executed by those critical sections.

<P><blockquote>
<P><IMG SRC="/images/ns/kernel/brcu/GracePeriodGood.png" WIDTH="497"
ALT="Grace periods extend to contain pre-existing RCU read-side critical
sections." height="263" border=0> 
</blockquote>

<P>However, note that RCU read-side critical sections
that begin after the beginning
of a given grace period can and will extend beyond the end of that grace
period.

<P>The following section gives a very high-level view of how
the Tiny RCU implementation operates.

</p><h3><a name="Design of Tiny RCU">
Design of Tiny RCU</a></h3>

<P>The key restriction that enables a smaller and simpler RCU
implementation is <code>CONFIG_SMP=n</code>, which means that
any time the sole CPU passes through a quiescent state, a
grace period has elapsed.
In principle, the scheduler could simply invoke all pending RCU callbacks
on each context switch, but in practice it is wise to maintain a degree
of isolation between the scheduler and RCU.
An arms-length relationship allows RCU callbacks to invoke appropriate
scheduler functions (e.g., <code>wake_up()</code>) without potential
deadlock issues.
Therefore, the RCU core runs in softirq context.

<p>This uniprocessor approach also simplifies the data structure, so
that each flavor of RCU (<code>rcu_ctrlblk</code> and
<code>rcu_bh_ctrlblk</code>) has the following structure:

<PRE>
  1 struct rcu_ctrlblk {
  2   long completed;
  3   struct rcu_head *rcucblist;
  4   struct rcu_head **donetail;
  5   struct rcu_head **curtail;
  6 };
</PRE>

<p>The <code>-&gt;completed</code> field is required only for the
<code>rcu_batches_completed()</code> and
<code>rcu_batches_completed_bh()</code> interfaces used by the
RCU torture tests.
The <code>-&gt;rcucblist</code> field is the header for the list
of RCU callbacks (<code>rcu_head</code> structures), the
<code>-&gt;donetail</code> field references the <code>next</code>
pointer of the last <code>rcu_head</code> structure in the list
whose grace period has completed, and the <code>-&gt;curtail</code>
field references the <code>next</code> pointer of the last
<code>rcu_head</code> structure in the list.

<p>The following figure shows a sample callback list that has two callbacks
ready to invoke and a third callback still waiting for a grace
period (or, equivalently on a uniprocessor system, for a quiescent
state):

<P><blockquote>
<P><IMG SRC="/images/ns/kernel/brcu/TinyRCUCallbacks.png" HEIGHT="223"
WIDTH="423" ALT="Tiny RCU callback list" border=0>
</blockquote>

<p>
</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 2"><b>Quick Quiz 2</b>:</a>
But we should be able to simply execute <i>all</i> callbacks at each
quiescent state!
So why bother with separate <code>-&gt;donetail</code> and
<code>-&gt;curtail</code> sublists?

<p>
<IMG SRC="/images/ns/kernel/brcu/RCUbweBlock-sm.png" HEIGHT="531"
WIDTH="244" ALT="Schematic of Tree RCU" border=0 hspace=2 align="right">

A block diagram of tiny RCU appears to the right; see <a
href="/Articles/323939/">this page</a> for a full-size version.


<p>The blue rectangles in this diagram represent functions making up
tiny RCU, the blue rectangles with rounded corners represent
data structures within tiny RCU, and the red rectangles represent
other parts of the Linux kernel.
Solid arrows represent function-call interfaces, while dashed arrows
represent indirect invocation.
The RCU read-side and list-manipulation primitives are not shown,
nor are the interfaces specific to the "rcutorture" test module.

<p>Like classic and hierarchical RCU, tiny RCU's grace-period detection
is driven by context switches, the scheduling-clock interrupt
(<code>scheduler_tick()</code>), and the idle loop.
The scheduling-clock interrupt handler and idle loops contain code as follows:

<PRE>
    if (rcu_pending(cpu))
	rcu_check_callbacks(cpu, 0);
</PRE>

<p>So if <code>rcu_pending()</code> indicates that the RCU core has
any work to do,
<code>rcu_check_callbacks()</code> is invoked, which in turn checks to see if
the CPU is currently in a quiescent state, invoking either or both
of <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> and <code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code>
as appropriate.
These in turn invoke <code>rcu_qsctr_help()</code>, which, if there are
RCU callbacks present, updates the callback lists to indicate that
their grace period has elapsed and returns 1 to tell the caller to
invoke <code>raise_softirq()</code>.
At some later time, <code>rcu_process_callbacks()</code> will be invoked
from softirq context, which, via <code>__rcu_process_callbacks()</code>,
invokes all callbacks in <code>rcu_ctrlblk</code> and
<code>rcu_bh_ctrlblk</code>.

<p>Tiny RCU also interfaces to dynticks, albeit in a slightly different way than
do the classic, preemptable, and hierarchical RCU implementations.
Because there is but a single CPU, entering dynticks-idle mode is both
a quiescent state and a grace period, allowing <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> to
directly invoke <code>raise_softirq()</code>.  This direct invocation in turn
means that <code>rcu_needs_cpu()</code> can simply return zero, since any
callbacks are processed on the way into dynticks-idle state.

<p>The <code>call_rcu()</code> and <code>call_rcu_bh()</code>
interfaces queue callbacks
via the <code>__call_rcu()</code> helper function.
The <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> interface is a special case that will be
described in the code walkthrough in the next section.

<p>Interestingly enough, the general shape of the above block diagram
applies to all RCU implementations.
Of course, the processing is more complex in the <code>CONFIG_SMP</code>
case, particularly in the <code>__rcu_process_callbacks()</code> area.

</p><h3><a name="Tiny-RCU Code Walkthrough">
Tiny-RCU Code Walkthrough</a></h3>

<p>This code walkthrough starts with tiny RCU's update-side API, then discusses
the grace-period machinery, and finally the dynticks interface.

</p><h4>Update-Side API</h4>

<p>The code for <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> is as follows:

<PRE>
  1 void synchronize_rcu(void)
  2 {
  3   unsigned long flags;
  4 
  5   local_irq_save(flags);
  6   rcu_ctrlblk.completed++;
  7   local_irq_restore(flags);
  8 }
</PRE>

<p>This code merely increments the <code>-&gt;completed</code> field
with interrupts disabled.
This works because <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> may only be invoked
when it is legal to block, in other words, <code>synchronize_rcu()</code>
cannot be called from within an RCU read-side critical section.
Therefore, anywhere <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> may legally
be invoked is guaranteed to be a quiescent state.
Because quiescent states are also grace periods on uniprocessor systems,
as noted by Josh Triplett,
any call to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> is automatically a grace
period.

</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 3"><b>Quick Quiz 3</b>:</a>
If all calls to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> are automatically
grace periods, why isn't <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> simply
an empty function?

</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 4"><b>Quick Quiz 4</b>:</a>
If all calls to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> are automatically
grace periods, why doesn't <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> process
any pending RCU callbacks?

<p>The following shows the code for the <code>call_rcu()</code> group
of functions:

<PRE>
  1 static void __call_rcu(struct rcu_head *head,
  2            void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rcu),
  3            struct rcu_ctrlblk *rcp)
  4 {
  5   unsigned long flags;
  6 
  7   head-&gt;func = func;
  8   head-&gt;next = NULL;
  9   local_irq_save(flags);
 10   *rcp-&gt;curtail = head;
 11   rcp-&gt;curtail = &amp;head-&gt;next;
 12   local_irq_restore(flags);
 13 }
 14 
 15 void call_rcu(struct rcu_head *head,
 16         void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rcu))
 17 {
 18   __call_rcu(head, func, &amp;rcu_ctrlblk);
 19 }
 20 
 21 void call_rcu_bh(struct rcu_head *head,
 22      void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rcu))
 23 {
 24   __call_rcu(head, func, &amp;rcu_bh_ctrlblk);
 25 }
</PRE>

<p>Lines&nbsp;1-13 show the code for <code>__call_rcu()</code>, which is a
common-code helping function.
Lines&nbsp;7-8 initialize the specified <code>rcu_head</code>
structure.
Line&nbsp;9 disables interrupts (and line&nbsp;12 restores them),
so that lines&nbsp;10-11 can enqueue the callback undisturbed by
interrupt handlers that might also invoke <code>call_rcu()</code>.

<p>Lines&nbsp;15-19 and lines&nbsp;21-25 are simple wrappers
implementing <code>call_rcu()</code> (which enqueues the callback
to <code>rcu_ctrlblk</code>) and <code>call_rcu_bh()</code>
(which enqueues the callback to <code>rcu_bh_ctrlblk</code>),
respectively.
The callbacks are enqueued to the last segment of the queue, in other
words, to the portion still waiting for a grace period to end.

</p><h4>Grace-Period Machinery</h4>

<p>The lowest-level grace-period machinery is supplied by
the <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> family of interfaces that
report passage through a quiescent state.
These functions are implemented as follows:

<PRE>
  1 static int rcu_qsctr_help(struct rcu_ctrlblk *rcp)
  2 {
  3   if (rcp->rcucblist != NULL &amp;&amp;
  4       rcp-&gt;donetail != rcp-&gt;curtail) {
  5     rcp-&gt;donetail = rcp-&gt;curtail;
  6     return 1;
  7   }
  8   return 0;
  9 }
 10 
 11 void rcu_qsctr_inc(int cpu)
 12 {
 13   if (rcu_qsctr_help(&amp;rcu_ctrlblk) ||
 14       rcu_qsctr_help(&amp;rcu_bh_ctrlblk))
 15         raise_softirq(RCU_SOFTIRQ);
 16 }
 17 
 18 void rcu_bh_qsctr_inc(int cpu)
 19 {
 20   if (rcu_qsctr_help(&amp;rcu_bh_ctrlblk))
 21         raise_softirq(RCU_SOFTIRQ);
 22 }
</PRE>

<p>Lines&nbsp;1-9 show <code>rcu_qsctr_help()</code>, which is a
common-code helper function for <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code>
(lines&nbsp;11-16) and <code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code>
(lines&nbsp;18-22), which in turn report ``rcu'' and ``rcu_bh''
quiescent states, respectively.

<p>Within <code>rcu_qsctr_help</code>,
lines&nbsp;3-4 check to see if there are any RCU callbacks
within the specified <code>rcu_ctrlblk</code> structure that are still
waiting for their grace period to complete, and, if so,
line&nbsp;5 updates the pointers so as to mark them as being ready to
invoke, and line&nbsp;6 returns non-zero in order to tell the caller
to cause the callback-processing code to start running.
Otherwise, line&nbsp;8 returns zero to tell the caller that it is not necessary
to process callbacks.

<p>The <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> function
invokes <code>rcu_qsctr_help()</code>
twice, once for rcu and once again for rcu_bh, and, if either indicates
that callback processing is required, it also invokes
<code>raise_softirq(RCU_SOFTIRQ)</code> to cause callback processing
to be performed.

</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 5"><b>Quick Quiz 5</b>:</a>
Why not simply directly call <code>rcu_process_callbacks()</code>?

<p>The <code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code> function
invokes <code>rcu_qsctr_help()</code>, but only for rcu_bh.
If the return value indicates that callback processing is required,
<code>raise_softirq(RCU_SOFTIRQ)</code> is invoked to make this happen.

</p><h4>Dynticks Interface</h4>

The tinyrcu dynticks interface is refreshingly simple, because uniprocessor
systems need not worry about the dynticks-idle state of the nonexistent
other CPUs.
The code is as follows:

<PRE>
  1 void rcu_enter_nohz(void)
  2 {
  3   if (--dynticks_nesting == 0)
  4     rcu_qsctr_inc(0);
  5 }
  6 
  7 void rcu_exit_nohz(void)
  8 {
  9   dynticks_nesting++;
 10 }
 11 
 12 void rcu_irq_enter(void)
 13 {
 14   rcu_exit_nohz();
 15 }
 16 
 17 void rcu_irq_exit(void)
 18 {
 19   rcu_enter_nohz();
 20 }
 21 
 22 void rcu_nmi_enter(void)
 23 {
 24 }
 25 
 26 void rcu_nmi_exit(void)
 27 {
 28 }
</PRE>

<p>The <code>rcu_enter_nohz()</code> function is shown on
lines&nbsp;1-5.
Line&nbsp;3 decrements the <code>dynticks_nesting</code> global variable,
and, if the result is zero, the CPU has entered dynticks-idle
mode, which is a quiescent state.
(The <code>dynticks_nesting</code> global variable is initialized to 1.)

</p><p><a name="Quick Quiz 6"><b>Quick Quiz 6</b>:</a>
Why is only <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> invoked?
What about <code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code>?

<p>The <code>rcu_exit_nohz()</code> function is shown on lines&nbsp;7-10.
This function simply increments the <code>dynticks_nesting</code> global
variable.

<p>As can be seen on lines&nbsp;12-20, the <code>rcu_irq_enter()</code>
and <code>rcu_irq_exit()</code> functions are simple wrappers around
<code>rcu_exit_nohz()</code> and <code>rcu_enter_nohz()</code>,
respectively.
Please note that entering an interrupt handler exits dynticks-idle
mode from an RCU viewpoint, and vice versa.
This often-confusing relationship is maintained in the names of these
functions.

<p>Lines&nbsp;22-28 show <code>rcu_nmi_enter()</code> and
<code>rcu_nmi_exit()</code>, both of which are empty functions.
Because we are running on a uniprocessor, we can safely ignore
NMI handlers.
The reason this is safe is that there cannot be any quiescent states
on this CPU within an NMI handler, and there are no other CPUs to
execute concurrent quiescent states.

<p>Finally, the <code>rcu_needs_cpu</code> function (not shown)
simply returns non-zero,
indicating that RCU is always prepared for a given CPU to go into
dynticks-idle mode.

</p><h3><a name="Testing">
Testing</a></h3>

<p>Running the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/305787/">script</a>
included in the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/305782/">hierarchical RCU article</a>
shows that the <code>CONFIG_NO_HZ</code> kernel config parameter
is important, and further
investigation identifies the <code>CONFIG_PREEMPT</code> parameter
as well.

<p>This results in a nice small set of testing scenarios:

<ol>

<p>Tiny RCU is about twice as small as Classic RCU (almost 900 bytes
saved), and more
than three times smaller than Hierarchical RCU (more than 2KB saved).

</p><h3><a name="Conclusion">
Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>As RCU's capabilities have grown, so has its code size.
This Bloatwatch edition of RCU forces this trend in reverse,
producing a very small
implementation via the <code>!CONFIG_SMP</code> restriction.
This implementation also provides a minimal Linux-kernel-capable
implementation that may provide a good starting point for people wishing
to learn about RCU implementations.

Answers to Quick Quizzes</a></h3>

<p><b>Quick Quiz 1</b>:
But what if I need my RCU read-side critical section to sleep and block?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
A special form of RCU called
"<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/202847/">SRCU</A>"
does permit general sleeping in SRCU read-side critical sections.
However, it is usually better to rework your RCU read-side critical
section to avoid sleeping and blocking.
One other exception is
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/253651/">preemptable RCU</a>,
which allows RCU read-side
critical sections to be preempted and to block while acquiring
what in non-RT kernels would be spinlocks.

<p><b>Quick Quiz 2</b>:
But we should be able to simply execute <i>all</i> callbacks at each
quiescent state!
Why to we need to separate <code>-&gt;donetail</code> and
<code>-&gt;curtail</code> sublists?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Recall that the callbacks are not invoked directly from the scheduler,
but rather from softirq context.
It would be illegal to invoke callbacks that were registered
after the quiescent state but before softirq commenced execution.
Such callbacks could be registered from within irq handlers by
invoking <code>call_rcu()</code>, and these irq handlers could be
invoked between the time that the quiescent state occurred and the
time that the softirq handler started executing.

</p><p><a href="#Quick%20Quiz%202"><b>Back to Quick Quiz 2</b>.</a>


</p><p><b>Quick Quiz 3</b>:
If all calls to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> are automatically
grace periods, why isn't <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> simply
an empty function?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>: If <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> were an
empty function, then rcutorture would incorrectly conclude that
RCU was not working, as it would appear to rcutorture that grace
periods were never ending.
Furthermore, <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> must at least prevent
the compiler from reordering code across the call to
<code>synchronize_rcu()</code>.

</p><p><a href="#Quick%20Quiz%203"><b>Back to Quick Quiz 3</b>.</a>


</p><p><b>Quick Quiz 4</b>:
If all calls to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> are automatically
grace periods, why doesn't <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> process
any pending RCU callbacks?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Because there currently appears to be no need to do so, given that
callbacks will be processed on the next context switch or the next
scheduling-clock interrupt from either user-mode execution or from
the idle loop.
Should experience demonstrate that these are insufficient, then
one approach would be to add a <code>raise_softirq(RCU_SOFTIRQ)</code>
statement to <code>synchronize_rcu()</code>.

</p><p><a href="#Quick%20Quiz%204"><b>Back to Quick Quiz 4</b>.</a>


</p><p><b>Quick Quiz 5</b>:
Why not simply directly call <code>rcu_process_callbacks()</code>?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Deferring execution to the softirq environment disentangles RCU callback
invocation from the scheduler, permitting the callbacks to freely
invoke things like <code>wake_up()</code>.
In addition, for rcu_bh, quiescent states might occur with locks
held, and the RCU callbacks might well need to acquire these locks,
potentially resulting in deadlock.
In both cases, deferring to the softirq environment ensures a clean
state for the callback.

</p><p><a href="#Quick%20Quiz%205"><b>Back to Quick Quiz 5</b>.</a>


</p><p><b>Quick Quiz 6</b>:
Why is only <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> invoked?
What about <code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code>?

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Because <code>rcu_qsctr_inc()</code> includes an implicit
<code>rcu_bh_qsctr_inc()</code>, as can be seen from the code
in the previous section.

If rcu_qsctr_help(&amp;rcu_ctrlblk) returns 1 when called by rcu_qsctr_inc, rcu_qsctr_help(&amp;rcp_bh_ctrlblk) won't be called and, as a result, if rcu_bh_ctrlblk.donetail != rcu_bh_ctrlblk.curtail, rcu_bh_ctrlblk.donetail won't be updated.

Good catch!!!  I need to use "+" or "|" in place of the "||".  Or did you have something else in mind?<br>
<p>
I checked rcuclassic.c and rcutree.c, and they avoid this problem because they simply call rcu_qsctr_inc() and rcu_bh_qsctr_inc() in sequence.<br>

Excuse my ignorance. I am somwehat reluctant to learn about RCU technology for the reason that i do not know what exactly is covered by patents and what is not covered. Does anyone know which RCU things are covered by patents and what are the implications of implementing some RCU technology in own proprietary or free code. <br>

My understanding is that you are free to use technology derived from IBM's RCU contributions in GPL-licensed free-software projects that use either GPLv2 or later.  The most prominent special case of this is of course the Linux kernel.<br>

<p>
Mounting a filesystem is typically an operation restricted to the root user
(or a process with <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>).  There are ways to allow
regular users to mount certain filesystems (e.g. removable devices like CDs
or USB sticks), but that needs to be set up in advance by an administrator.
In addition, <a href="http://docs.1h.com/Bind_mounts">bind mounts</a>,
which mount a portion of an already-mounted 
filesystem in another location, always require privileges.  <a
href="/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> will allow 
any user to be 
root inside their own namespace—thus be able to mount files and filesystems
in (currently) unexpected ways.  As might be guessed, that can lead to some
surprising behavior that a patch set from Eric W. Biederman is trying to
address. 
</p>

<p>
The problem crops up when someone tries to delete or rename a file or directory
that has 
been used as a mount point elsewhere.  A user only needs read access to a
file (and execute permissions to the directories in the path) to be able to
use it as a mount point, which means that users can mount filesystems
over files they don't own.  When the owner of the file (or directory) goes
to remove it, they get an <tt>EBUSY</tt> error—for no obvious reason.
Biederman has <a href="/Articles/569672/">proposed</a> changing that with a
set of patches that would allow the unlink or rename to proceed and to
quietly unmount 
anything mounted there.
</p>

<p>
For example, if two users were to set up new mount and user namespaces
("user1" creates "ns1", "user2" creates "ns2"), the existing kernel would
give the following behavior:
<pre>
    ns1$ ls foo
    f1   f2
    ns1$ mount foo /tmp/user2/bar
</pre>
Over in the other namespace, user2 tries to remove their temporary
directory:
<pre>
    ns2$ ls /tmp/user2/bar
    ns2$ rmdir /tmp/user2/bar
    rmdir: failed to remove ‘bar’: Device or resource busy
</pre>

<p>
The visibility of mounts in other mount namespaces is part of the problem.
A user getting an <tt>EBUSY</tt> when they attempt to remove their own
directory may not even be able to determine <i>why</i> they are getting the
error. 
They may not be able to see the mount on top of their file because it was made in
another namespace. Coupled with user namespaces, this would allow
unprivileged users to perform a denial of 
service attack against other users—including those more privileged.
</p>

<p>
Biederman's patches first add mount tracking to the virtual filesystem (VFS)
layer.  That will allow the later patches to find any mounts associated
with a particular mount point.  Using that, all of the mounts for a given
directory entry (dentry) can be unmounted, which is exactly what is done
when a mount point is deleted or renamed. 
</p>

<p>
The idea was generally greeted favorably, but Linus Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/570476/">raised an issue</a>: some programs are written to
expect that <tt>rmdir()</tt> on a non-empty directory has no side effects,
as it just returns <tt>ENOTEMPTY</tt>.  The existing behavior is to return
<tt>EBUSY</tt> if the directory is a mount point, but under Biederman's patches, any mount on
the directory would be unmounted before determining whether the directory
is empty and can be removed.  That essentially adds a side effect to
<tt>rmdir()</tt> even if it fails.  

<p>
In addition,
depending on the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt">mount
propagation</a> settings, the mount in another namespace might be visible.
So, a user looking at "their" directory may actually be seeing files that
were mounted by another user.  But if they try to delete the directory (or
some program does), it might succeed because the underlying mount point
directory is empty, which may violate the principle
of least surprise.  
</p>

<p>
Torvalds was not at all sure that any application cares, but was concerned
that it made the change to the semantics larger than needed.  He also had a
suggestion for a way forward:
<div class="BigQuote">
That said, I like the _concept_ of being able to remove a mount-point
and the mount just goes away. But I do think that for sanity sake, it
should have something like "if one of the mounts is in the current
namespace, return -EBUSY". IOW, the patch-series would make the VFS
layer _able_ to remove mount-points, but a normal rmdir() when
something is mounted in that namespace would fail in order to give
legacy behavior.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Biederman agreed and proposed another <a href="/Articles/570478/">patch</a>
that would cause <tt>rmdir()</tt> to fail with an <tt>EBUSY</tt> if there
is a mount on the directory in the current mount namespace.  Mounts in
other mount namespaces would continue to be unmounted in that case.  But there
were some questions raised about whether renaming mount points (or
<tt>unlink()</tt>ing file mount points) should get the same treatment.  
</p>

<p>
Serge E. Hallyn <a href="/Articles/570479/">asked</a>: "<q>Do you think we should do the same thing for over-mounted file at
vfs_unlink()?</q>"  In other words: if the mount is atop a <i>file</i>
that is removed (<tt>unlink()</tt>ed), rather than a 
directory, should the same rule be applied?  The question was eventually
broadened to include <tt>rename()</tt> as well.
At first, Biederman thought the rules should only apply to
<tt>rmdir()</tt>, believing that 
the permissions in the enclosing directories should be sufficient to
avoid any problems with the other two operations. But 
after some 
discussion with  Miklos Szeredi and Andy Lutomirski, he <a
href="/Articles/570480/">changed his mind</a>.  For consistency, as well as
alleviating a race condition in earlier (pre-<tt>UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW</tt>)
versions of the <tt>fusermount</tt> command, "<q>the most practical path
I can see is to block unlink, 
rename, and rmdir if there is a mount in the local namespace</q>". 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>fusermount</tt> race comes about because of its attempt to ensure
that the mount point it is unmounting does not change out from under it.  A
malicious user could replace the mount point with a symbolic link to some
other filesystem, which the root-privileged <tt>fusermount</tt> would
happily unmount.
Earlier, Biederman had <a href="/Articles/570481/">seen</a> that problem as
an insurmountable hurdle to his approach for 
fixing 
the <tt>rmdir()</tt> problem.  But, not allowing mount point renames
eliminates 
most of 
the concern with the <tt>fusermount</tt> race condition.  There are still
unlikely scenarios where an older 
<tt>fusermount</tt> binary and a newer kernel could be subverted to unmount
any filesystem, but 
Szeredi, who is the FUSE maintainer, is <a href="/Articles/570482/">not
overly worried</a>. It should be noted that there are other ways to "win" that
race even in existing kernels (by renaming a parent directory of the mount
point, for example).
</p>

<p>
New <a href="/Articles/570482/">patches</a> reflecting the changes
suggested by various reviewers were posted on October&nbsp;15.  Biederman
is targeting the
3.13 kernel, so there is some more time for reviewers to weigh in.
It is a change that interested folks should be paying attention to, as it
does subtly change the longtime behavior of the kernel.  

<p>
It is, in some ways,
another example of the unintended consequences of user namespaces.  
If user namespaces are not enabled, the problem is essentially just a
source of potential confusion;
it only becomes a denial of service when they are enabled. But,
if distributions are to ever enable user namespaces, these  
kinds of problems need to be found and fixed.

This is a problem independent of user namespaces.<br>
<p>
linux-user-chroot[1] allows you to run commands in a separate mount<br>
namespace, since it's a privileged suid helper.<br>
<p>
I have a build tool that prevents builds from messing with my system,<br>
by making most of my rootfs read-only.<br>
<p>
Currently I hit this mount point removal problem if I try to build two<br>
different things at once.<br>

I do not know how you are hitting this problem but it sounds like even with my changes you will have a problem.  Aka one build environment killing a file or directory the other build environment is using for a mount point.<br>
<p>
That said I agree, that this can be a problem already.<br>
<p>
One of the points of user namespaces is to take a bunch of kernel functionality we have been allowing non-root users to use for a long time and remove the need for the suid root helpers.  Much like what happened with ptys with the introduction of /dev/ptmx.<br>

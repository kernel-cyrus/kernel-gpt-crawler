<h1>Reorganizing the address space</h1>

hspace=4 alt="[memory layout diagram]" align="right">
The traditional organization of the virtual address space (as seen from
user space, on x86 systems) is as shown in the diagram to the right.  The
very bottom part of the address space is unused; it is there to catch NULL
pointers and such.  Starting at 0x8000000 is the program text - the
read-only, executable code.  The text is followed by the heap region, being
the memory obtainable via the <tt>brk()</tt> system call.  Typically
functions like <tt>malloc()</tt> obtain their memory from this area;
non-automatic program data is also stored there.  
<p>
The heap differs from the first two regions in that it grows in response to
program needs.  A program like <tt>cat</tt> will not make a lot of demands
on the heap (one hopes), while running a <tt>yum update</tt> can grow the
heap in a truly disturbing way.  The heap can expand up to 1GB
(0x40000000), at which point it runs into the mmap area; this is where
shared libraries and other regions created by the <tt>mmap()</tt> system
call live.  The mmap area, too, grows upward to accommodate new mappings.
<p>
Meanwhile, the kernel owns the last 1GB of address space, up at
0xc0000000.  The kernel is inaccessible to user space, but it occupies that
portion of the address space regardless.  Immediately below the kernel is
the stack region, where things like automatic variables live.  The stack
grows downward.  On a really bad day, the stack and the mmap area can run
into each other, at which point things start to fail.
<p>
This organization has worked for some time, but it does have a couple of
disadvantages.  It fragments the address space, such that neither the heap
nor the mmap area can make use of the entire space.  If one program makes
heavy use of the heap, it could run out of memory, even though a large
chunk of space is available between the mmap area and the stack.  Normally,
not even <tt>yum</tt> can occupy that much heap, but there are other
applications out there which are up to that challenge.
<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/mmap2.png" width=181 height=349 border=0
hspace=4 alt="[revised memory layout]" align="left">
As a way of making life safer for the true memory hogs out there, Ingo
Molnar has posted <a href="/Articles/90311/">a patch</a> which rearranges
user space along the lines of the revised diagram on the left.  The mmap area has been
moved up to the top of the address space, and it now grows downward toward
the heap.  As a result, the bulk of the address space is preserved in a
single, contiguous chunk which can be allocated to either the heap or mmap,
as the application requires.
<p>
As an added bonus, this organization reduces the amount of kernel memory
required to hold each process's page tables, since the fragment at
0x40000000 is no longer present.
<p>
There are a couple of disadvantages to this approach.  One is that the
stack area is rather more confined than it used to be.  The actual size of
the stack area is determined by the process's stack size resource limit,
with a sizable cushion added, so problems should be rare.  The other
problem is that, apparently, a very small number of applications get
confused by the new layout.  Any application which is sensitive to how
virtual memory is laid out is buggy to begin with; <a
href="/Articles/91848/">according to Arjan van de Ven</a>, the most common
case is applications which store pointers in integer variables and then do
the wrong thing when they see a "negative" value.
<p>

The fact is that most users will never notice the change; for a
demonstration, consider that Fedora kernels have been shipping with this
patch for some time.  Even a vanilla Fedora Core&nbsp;1 system has it; a
command like "<tt>cat /proc/self/maps</tt>" will show the new layout at
work.  The patch is currently part of the -mm kernel, and will probably
find its way into the mainline before too long.

      <p>Such applications are already broken. There's never been any guarantee that the the specified <i>start</i> address would be honored, and the <i>mmap</i> documentation has always been clear on that.

      There's a difference between non-portable and broken.  For example, I've used the mmap start address specification to do emulation and testing (on my desktop machine) of a flash filesystem that would run on an embedded device (and that was located at a certain address on that device).  While the mmap call wasn't guaranteed to work, it did, and saved me a few weeks of effort re-writing the filesystem.<p>If this change broke my program (it didn't) I wouldn't have cause to yell too loud; it was not guaranteed to continue to work.  But I still wouldn't call the program &quot;broken&quot;.<p>-Bill

      The default .text base on x86 is 0x08048000, chosen by the default linker script for static binding (which is revealed by <tt>ld --verbose</tt>).  I believe that the value 0x08048000 originates in early Unix-like software for x86 from Santa Cruz.  The value 0x40000000 is the kernel symbol TASK_UMAPPED_BASE.  Another reason to avoid the address range 0 to 0x110000 (1MB + 64KB) is for use by vm86 mode.  Fedora Core 1 and 2 also have features <tt>exec-shield</tt> and <tt>exec-shield-randomize</tt>, which default to 1 ("on") in <tt>/proc/sys/kernel</tt>.  Exec-shield tries to put an mmap() that specifies PROT_EXEC (and not MAP_FIXED) into the range 1MB to 16MB, because the return address to a CALL from that range has a high byte of 0.  This tends to limit damage by malware that overwrites the stack (and hence return addresses) with strings, because <tt>'\0'</tt> occurs infrequently in the new data.  Exec-shield-randomize also varies the base address of such an mmap(), which tends to improve the chance of avoiding a malware attack that depends on fixed addresses.  Preference for low addresses with PROT_EXEC also enhances the effectiveness of setting the segment limit for the <tt>cs</tt> code segment to the least upper bound of pages having PROT_EXEC.  This is another [partial] defense against malware.
<p>The details of kernel policy on mmap() are more important than they should be, partly because Linux lacks a binary structure interface to <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</tt>.  It is tedious and painful to have to parse variable-length character data that contains non-quoted literal strings.  Nothing prevents a filename from having a path component that looks like a line from <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</tt>.  Win32 has a binary structure interface VirtualQuery() which is concise, fast, and easy to decode.  With such an interface, it is easy for the user to manage placement policy for all the pages of the address space.  On Linux, it requires a dirty hack: <a href="http://www.BitWagon.com/tub.html">http://www.BitWagon.com/tub.html</a>

      <cite> I believe that the value 0x08048000 originates in early Unix-like software for x86 from Santa Cruz</cite><p>

IIRC, the value 0x08048000 was chosen to accomodate the stack <em>below</em> the .text section (i.e., in the unused black space in the illustrations), growing downward. The 0x48000 bytes could be mapped by the same page table already required by the .text section (thus saving a page table in most cases), while the remaining 0x08000000 would allow more room for stack-hungry applications. <p>
I have always wondered why the stack ended up in the upper portion of the address space. Is there any technical reason, or only historical? Anybody knows?

      I really thought the layout of the address space had more to do with /usr/lib/crt0.o and ELF <br>headers than the kernel.  Am I hopelessly mistaken?

      When you call mmap(2) without specifying a preferred memory address, then the kernel's defaults kick in.  <p>Since moste mmap()s do not specify any address, the kernel's defaults determine the amount of contiguous virtual memory available to pretty much every application. This is what's fixed by Ingo's patch.

      While the ELF headers don't affect where the program's mmaps and mallocs get memory, they do determine where the program itself gets loaded.  That means all the stuff that's in the ELF file - the text section, data section, etc.
<p>
Note that the layout change here doesn't affect where the program gets loaded.

      Hmm, I wonder what stack size is reserved for a process' stack size resource limit of 'unlimited' (I assume it is picked up from the 'ulimit -s' setting).<p>From observation, I believe that malloc() will suballocate memory from the mmap() region if it needs / wants to, anyway.<p>So the distinction between the &quot;heap&quot; and &quot;mmap&quot; sections are less distinct than that presented, I believe. Only &quot;statically&quot; allocated memory (eg. for the data for static &amp; global variables in C), is allocated &quot;exclusively&quot; from the &quot;heap&quot; section.<p>The general run of applications don't particularly care how memory is laid out, and therefore shouldn't be adversely effected by any change.<p>However, the category of application that this change is probably trying to address (the &quot;memory hogs&quot; referred to above) are probably precisely those that take special measures to try and achieve the best results from the existing memory layout.<p>They are also, therefore, most liable to (arguably) &quot;legitimate&quot; breakage when the layout scheme is changed, and most impacted if the ramifications of any such change are not fully thought through.

      It's sbrk(2) vs. mmap(2).  Calling malloc(3) usually results in a call<br>to sbrk(2) if there is not enough free space, but sometimes, in some<br>implementations, it can result in a call to mmap(2).

      Is there still a gap between stack and mmap? I'd rather there is as it will catch stack overflow.

      Great explanation, thank you.<br>
<p>
Just one thing that makes me curious... beforehand, some words on the situation. I've developed a highly specific, thread-safe allocator for a CAD-Kernel not using the OS-malloc utility. Originally designed on Win32, this allocator is using the Virtual* functions for allocation. As a post further down stated, those functions are highly straightforward. On my way to LINUX one question pains me: do I have to care for sbrk() at all or may I exclusively use the mmap() functions (and by-the-way gain POSIX conformance)? More precisely, by giving a start address to mmap(), can I force mmap() to go below the sbrk() threshold? The latter figure somewhat supposes that this is possible...<br>
<p>
Further information is gratefully appreciated.<br>
<p>
Christian.<br>

</div>
<p>
At the inaugural <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/vault">Vault</a> conference,
Sasha Levin gave a presentation on filesystem fuzzingâ€”deliberately
providing random bad input to the kernel to try to find bugs.  He described
different kinds of 
fuzzing, along with giving examples of some security bugs that
were found. 

The conference itself focused on Linux
storage and filesystems and was held March&nbsp;11-12 in Boston.  It
attracted around 400 attendees, which has led the Linux Foundation to
schedule another 
Vault for next year in Raleigh, North Carolina.
</p>

<p>
Levin started by saying that Linux has a problem with "shitty code".  That's
not because the developers are not skilled, nor is it that code review is
going by the wayside.  The biggest problem is that the code does not get
all that much testing until after it is merged into the mainline.  At that
point, users get their hands on it and start to find bugs.
</p>

<h4>Kernel testing</h4>

<p>
Testing the kernel is done by multiple groups in the ecosystem.  Developers
will run some tests against their code; for filesystems those tests might
include xfstests.  Quality assurance (QA) groups will also run tests, but
those are typically limited to existing test suites with a known set of
tests.  The kernel is a "big, scary machine", he said, and it needs more
testing. 
</p>

<p>
There are two different kinds of testing: manual and automated.  Manual tests
are typically run by developers based on the code they changed.  If a
developer changes the <tt>open()</tt> call, for example, they "poke it a
little bit" to 
see if anything is broken.  That kind of testing is slow and requires a
human to create, run, and interpret the tests.  It doesn't really scale so
that multiple testers could get involved, either.
</p>

<p>
Automated tests essentially perform the manual tests automatically.  Once a
test suite covers the basics, though, people stop adding tests except to
check for regressions.  There is not much done with these test suites
(such as the Linux Test Project, xfstests, Filebench, IOzone, and others)
to find new bugs.  In addition, there is no real effort to test new
features.
</p>

<p>
Users test the code by doing their normal work.  They may have a technical
background, but they did not review the patches and are not working on the
filesystem.  They are just trying to get their work done and have not
set out to test anything.
</p>

<p>
There are some things missing from today's testing.  Test developers don't
try to 
guess what users will or won't do so that tests cover the corner cases.
Test suites 
generally just check for regressions.  In addition, there is little
imagination that goes into test development, since creating new features is
much more interesting to developers than creating new tests.

<p>
For example, he mentioned
the <a href="/Articles/636797/"><tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> issues</a> that have
been discussed in kernel forums (including the <a
href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory
Management (LSFMM) Summit</a>) recently.  Dave Chinner added tests to xfstests to
observe 
that problem, but only after the problems had been hit.  That means that
someone ran into those problems and ended up with a corrupted filesystem.
It would be nice to find those kinds of problems <i>before</i> someone hits
them and ends up complaining about a "shitty kernel", he said.
</p>

<h4>Fuzzing</h4>

<p>
Fuzzing is a technique that effectively creates new tests on the fly.  Some
of those tests are stupid, but others may find bugs.  In addition, fuzzing
frameworks tend to be heavily threaded which puts a different kind of load
on filesystems.  The existing test suites do put a load on the filesystem,
but it is basically the same load over and over again.  So fuzzing can help
test concurrency in the filesystem as well.
</p>

<p>
"Structure fuzzing" simply takes a filesystem image, makes some changes to
it, and then tries to mount it.  Some of those tests have found kernel crashes
or panics at mount time.  But not every corruption can or will be found at
mount time because that is too expensive to check.  Testing with other
operations will show whether the corruption is handled appropriately
post-mount. 
</p>

<p>
But just flipping every bit in the filesystem image doesn't really make too
much sense as a test.  That's where "smart structure fuzzing" comes into
play.  This kind of testing is filesystem-specific as it must have some
knowledge of the structure of the filesystem.  Since that structure can't
really change often (it resides on-disk), this kind of testing does not
need to be done all of the time.  It can be run occasionally, especially
when there are changes that might affect the binary format.
</p>

<p>
"API fuzzing" is more popular, Levin said.  It typically fuzzes the virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer, so it is not necessarily filesystem-specific.
Basically, API fuzzing tries passing lots of different values to the system
calls to see if it can break something.
</p>

<p>
"Smart API fuzzing" takes that one step further by incorporating knowledge
about the kinds of values that make sense as parameters to the system
calls.  For example, <tt>chmod()</tt> takes a <tt>path</tt> and a
<tt>mode</tt>.  The first check in <tt>chmod()</tt> is to see if the
<tt>mode</tt> value is reasonable, so sending all of the 2<sup>16</sup>
possibilities doesn't make sense all of the time.  Doing that occasionally
is useful, but it is overkill to test the same error path over and over.
</p>

<p>
As an example of what this kind of fuzzing can find, Levin pointed to <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1420">CVE-2015-1420</a>.
It is an invalid memory access in <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html"><tt>open_by_handle_at()</tt></a>
that was found because the fuzzer knew what the function expects.  In a
multithreaded test, it was able to change the size in a structure between
the time it was used for allocating a buffer and the time it was used to
actually read the data.  Since the fuzzer had knowledge of the parameters
and their types, it could change them in multiple threads.
</p>

<p>
Having many threads all accessing the filesystem is a place where fuzzers
shine.  For example, simulating 10,000 users is easy, which can help catch
untested scenarios, he said.  It makes it easier to catch problems where a
lot of load is needed to hit them.
</p>

<p>
<a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4171">CVE-2014-4171</a>
was an example of a bug that needed a high load to find.  It is a local
denial of service that can happen when accessing the region around a hole
in a file using 
<tt>mmap()</tt> while that hole is being punched in another thread.  It was
easy to see in the code once it was discovered, but it was only found under
heavy load from the fuzzer. 
</p>

<p>
That is one of the benefits of fuzzing, he said, that it creates tests that
no filesystem developer would ever think of.  It will do things that are
not reasonable and don't make any sense.  For example, <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8086">CVE-2014-8086</a>
is a race condition that was discovered when switching between asynchronous
I/O and direct I/O, which is something that "no one really does".  But a
malicious user can, of course.
</p>

<p>
It is nice to know that some set of tests cover most or all of the lines of
code of 
interest, but it does not mean that the code is right.  There are multiple
paths through any code, so it is important to have lots of threads
exercising different paths from different places.  Executing rarely used
paths is useful as well.
</p>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

<p>
There are some disadvantages to fuzzing, though.  For one thing, there is
no pass/fail criteria.  Since it is random, you can't say that if it runs
for an hour it is considered a "pass".  It may miss  completely obvious
errors. As Peter Zijlstra put it, running for some length of time "doesn't
mean that the behavior is right, just that it didn't explode".  There may
be plenty of bugs lurking that just don't cause a big enough problem to
crash the test (or the kernel).
</p>

<p>
Fuzzing really needs to run continuously, Levin said.  It can't just be run
overnight and checked in the morning.  Instead it should be run
continuously and checked daily.  Fuzzing is a resource hog too, but that
actually helps testing the memory management code, especially for huge
pages.  The tests split lots of pages and make it hard to collapse them
back into huge pages, he said.
</p>

<p>
Reproducing bugs found by the fuzzer can be quite difficult.
Unfortunately, the right answer for causing the bug to happen again is
often "run 
the fuzzer and wish for the best".  It is difficult to output the results
of tests because the amount of data slows the system down.  Things like the
last system call made aren't all that helpful, he said.  Intel's <a
href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/18/processor-tracing">Processor
Trace</a> (which Levin <a href="/Articles/636549/">learned
about at LSFMM</a>) may help the situation eventually.
</p>

<p>
Levin suggested that the community should be doing more fuzzing.
Developers should be doing some fuzzing before they send in patches and QA
folks should be fuzzing continuously.  
A QA person in the audience asked about getting more information out of the
kernel when it fails from fuzzing.  Levin suggested setting up the kernel
to do a memory dump when it gets a <tt>BUG_ON()</tt>.  He will also be
working on better <tt>BUG_ON()</tt> reporting.
</p>

<p>
He uses the <a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/">Trinity
fuzz tester</a> for all of the API fuzzing and a different, unnamed tool
for filesystem structure fuzzing.  He runs Trinity in a virtual machine, while
Trinity developer Dave Jones runs it on real hardware, so they find
different kinds of bugs.  Levin has not gotten to the point where
he can run Trinity on linux-next for a week without hitting problems; so
far he has not needed to look 
anywhere else for fuzzing tests.

Even though it only targets a *single* system call, it took 2 years and 30 plus fixes to sort things to the point that the upcoming 4.0 kernel (plus two additional patches) is the first one ever that this fuzzer won't completely crash within minutes.<br>

I once tested some aspects of a C compiler being developed by a kind of fuzzer that produced semi-randomly valid program snippets that were then compiled and run both by the tested compiler and a reference compiler, and the outputs compared. Differences (or a crash) indicated there was something requiring a closer look. Unfortunately some differences were benign, resulting from different expression evaluation order, but it did help find many problems.
<p>
I wonder if some of the file system fuzzing could employ the same idea, by doing identical operations to two different file systems and comparing the effect.

This reminds of the IRON file systems work done at U. Wisconsin a few years back. A research group there did fault injection testing between the block layer and the filesystem layer. They found several bugs in ext3, reiser3, and JFS.<br>

Glad to see folks picking up these ideas.<br>

In hardware circles this kind of testing is called 'constrained random verification', it is very effective and fairly easy to deploy. Coupled with good code coverage metrics you can quickly get some idea on what code paths need special attention. It is amazing the corner cases these tools can find.<br>
<p>
On the down side, the hardware projects I've done lately end up with a 50/50 split of actual device code vs test code, and the key thing that makes this testing possible is writing every algorithm twice. Once in a very high level inefficient way, and then a second time in the highly optimized parallel version needed for hardware. The testing focuses on ensuring the two behave the same.<br>
<p>
The other down side is the tooling to do this costs about 50k$ per user :(<br>
<p>
I've always wanted a similar constraints language for normal software.. Like specify a regex pattern for a string and the constraints solver produces random strings that conform to that pattern. Or a tool that can take an ANTLR description and produce random valid strings.<br>
<p>
I continue to be amazed when people dismiss the need for static analysis (eg type checking, etc) on the basis you need to test anyhow, but then use languages have really basic test capabilities and almost no coverage capability. So people write little hand coded tests and feel good about things with no idea how the tests are actually performing.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 17, 2012</br>
           </div>
The "bufferbloat" problem is the result of excessive buffering in the
network stack; it leads to long latencies and poor reliability in the
network as a whole.  Fixing it is a matter of buffering less data in each
system between any two endpoints—a task that sounds simple, but proves to
be more challenging than one might expect.  It turns out that buffering can
show up in many surprising places in the networking stack; tracking all of
these places down and fixing them is not always easy.
<p>
A number of bloat-fighting changes have gone into the kernel over the last
year.  The <a href="/Articles/496509/">CoDel queue management algorithm</a>
works to prevent packets from building up in router queues over time.  At a
much lower level, <a href="/Articles/454390/">byte queue limits</a> put a
cap on the amount of data that can be waiting to go out a specific network
interface.  Byte queue limits work only at the device queue level, though,
while the networking stack has other places—such as the queueing discipline
level—where buffering can happen.  So there would be value in an
implementation that could limit buffering at levels above the device queue.
<p>
Eric Dumazet's <a href="/Articles/506237/">TCP small queues patch</a> looks
like it should be able to fill at least part of that gap.  It limits the
amount of data that can be queued for transmission by any given socket
regardless of where the data is queued, so it shouldn't be fooled by
buffers lurking in the queueing, traffic control, or netfilter code. That
limit is set by a new sysctl knob found at:
<p>
<pre>
    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_limit_output_bytes
</pre>
<p>
The default value of this limit is 128KB; it could be set lower on systems
where latency is the primary concern.
<p>
The networking stack already tracks the amount of data waiting to be
transmitted through any given socket; that value lives in the
<tt>sk_wmem_alloc</tt> field of <tt>struct sock</tt>.  So applying a limit
is relatively easy; <tt>tcp_write_xmit()</tt> need only look to see if
<tt>sk_wmem_alloc</tt> is above the limit.  If that is the case, the socket
is marked as being throttled and no more packets are queued.
<p>
The harder part is figuring out when some space opens up and it is possible
to add more packets to the queue.  The time when queue space becomes free
is when a queued packet is freed.  So Eric's patch overrides the normal
<tt>struct sk_buff</tt> destructor when an output limit is in effect; the
new destructor can check to see whether it is time to queue more data for
the relevant socket.  The only problem is that this destructor can be
called from deep within the network stack with important locks already
held, so it cannot queue new data directly.  So Eric had to add a new
tasklet to do the actual job of queuing new packets.
<p>
It seems that the patch is having the intended result:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Results on my dev machine (tg3 nic) are really impressive, using
	standard pfifo_fast, and with or without TSO/GSO. Without reduction of
	nominal bandwidth.
	I no longer have 3MBytes backlogged in qdisc by a single netperf
	session, and both side socket autotuning no longer use 4 Mbytes.
</div>
<p>
He also <a href="/Articles/507090/">ran some tests</a> over a 10Gb link and
was able to get full wire speed, even with a relatively small output
limit.
<p>
There are some outstanding questions, still. For example, Tom Herbert <a
href="/Articles/507095/">asked</a> about how this mechanism interacts with
more complex queuing disciplines; that question will take more time and
experimentation to answer.  Tom also suggested that the limit could be made
dynamic and tied to the lower-level byte queue limits.  Still, the patch
seems like an obvious win, so it has already been pulled into the net-next
tree for the 3.6 kernel.  The details can be worked out
later, and the feature can always be turned off by default if problems
emerge during the 3.6 development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This looks great. I have one question though: shouldn't this be made into generic infrastructure that can be used by other transport protocols?  I  imagine this would be helpful for UDP, SCTP, and DCCP sockets as well.  The limit probably doesn't even need to be per protocol.<br>

It's good that this is being worked on but I'm concerned that there may be side effects in this approach, small fixed size buffers followed by some magic auto tuning buffers. CoDel achieves its robust simplicity by not worrying about buffer sizes at all but instead by tracking latency because getting an algorithm right to pick an appropriate buffer size per flow proved impossible. It seems like they might be going down a path that is already known not to work or maybe that experience doesnt apply at this layer of the stack. <br>

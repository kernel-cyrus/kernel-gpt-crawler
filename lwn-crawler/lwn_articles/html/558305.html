<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 10, 2013</br>
           </div>
Dave Miller's networking git tree is a busy place; it typically feeds over
1,000 changesets into the mainline each development cycle.  Linus clearly
sees the networking subsystem as being well managed, though, and there are
rarely difficulties when Dave puts in his pull requests.  So it was
surprising to see Linus reject Dave's request for the big 3.11 pull.  In
the end, it came down to the <a href="/Articles/551284/">low-latency
Ethernet device polling patches</a>, which had to go through some urgent
repairs while the rest of the networking pull request waited.
<p>
The point of this patch set is to enable low-latency data reception by
applications that are willing to busy wait (in the kernel) if data is not
available when a <tt>read()</tt> or <tt>poll()</tt> operation is performed
on a socket.  Busy waiting is normally avoided in the kernel, but, if
latency matters more than anything else, some users will be willing to
accept the cost of spinning in the kernel if it allows them to avoid
the cost of context switches when the data arrives.  The hope is that
providing this 
functionality in the kernel will lessen the incentive for certain types of
users to install user-space networking stacks.
<p>
Since this patch set was covered here in May, it has seen a few changes.
As was predicted, a <tt>setsockopt()</tt> option (<tt>SO_LL</tt>) was added
so that the polling behavior could be adjusted on a per-socket basis;
previously, all sockets in the system would use busy waiting if the feature
was enabled in the kernel.  Another flag (<tt>POLL_LL</tt>) was added for
the <tt>poll()</tt> system call; once again, it causes busy waiting to
happen even if the kernel is otherwise configured not to use it.  The
runtime kernel configuration itself was split into two sysctl knobs:
<tt>low_latency_read</tt> to set the polling time for <tt>read()</tt>
operations, and <tt>low_latency_poll</tt> for <tt>poll()</tt> and
<tt>select()</tt>.  Setting either knob to zero (the default) disables busy
waiting for the associated operation.
<p>
When the time came to push the networking changes for 3.11, Dave put the
low-latency patches at the top of his list of new features.  Linus was <a
href="/Articles/558307/">not impressed</a>, though.  He had a number of
complaints, ranging from naming and documentation through to various
implementation issues and the fact that changes had been made to the core
<tt>poll()</tt> code without going through the usual channels.  He later <a
href="/Articles/558308/">retracted</a> some of his complaints, but still
objected to a number of things.  For example, he called out code like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (ll_flag &amp;&amp; can_ll &amp;&amp; can_poll_ll(ll_start, ll_time))
</pre>
<p>
saying that it "<q>should have made anybody sane go 'WTF?' and wonder
about bad drugs.</q>"  More seriously, he strongly disliked the
"low-latency" name, saying that it obscured the real effect of the patch.
That name, he said, should be changed:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The "ll" stands for "low latency", but that makes it sound all
	good. Make it describe what it actually does: "busy loop", and
	write it out. So that people understand what the actual downsides
	are. We're not a marketing group.
</div>
<p>
So, for example, he was not going to accept <tt>POLL_LL</tt> in the
user-space interface; he requested <tt>POLL_BUSY_LOOP</tt> instead.  
<p>
Beyond that, Linus disliked how the core polling code worked, saying that
it was more complicated than it needed to be.  He made a number of
suggestions for improving the implementation.  Importantly, he wanted to be
sure that polling would not happen if the <tt>need_resched</tt> flag is set
in the <tt>current</tt> structure.  That flag indicates that a
higher-priority process is waiting to run on the CPU; when it is set, the
current process needs to get out of the way as quickly as possible.
Clearly, performing a busy wait for network data would not be the right
thing to do in such a situation.  Linus did not say that the proposed patch
violated that rule, but it was not sufficiently clear to him that things
would work as they needed to.
<p>
In response to these perceived shortcomings, Linus refused the entire patch
set, putting just 
over 1,200 changes on hold.  He didn't reject the low-latency work
altogether, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	End result: I think the code is salvageable and people who want
	this kind of busy-looping can have it. But I really don't want to
	merge it as-is. I think it was badly done, I think it was badly
	documented, and I think somebody over-sold the feature by
	emphasizing the upsides and not the problems.
</div>
<p>
As one might imagine, that put a bit of pressure on Eliezer Tamir, the
author of the patches in question.  The merge window is only two weeks
long, so the requested changes needed to be made in a hurry.  Eliezer was
up to the challenge, though, producing the requested changes in short
order.  On July&nbsp;9, Dave posted <a href="/Articles/558310/">a new pull
request</a> with the updated code; Linus pulled the networking tree the
same day, though not before posting <a href="/Articles/558389/">a
complaint</a> about some unrelated issues.
<p>
In this case, the last-minute review clearly improved the quality of the
implementation; in particular, the user-visible option to <tt>poll()</tt>
is now more representative of what it really does
(<tt>SO_LL</tt> remains unchanged, but it will become <tt>SO_BUSY_WAIT</tt>
before 3.11 is released).  The cost, of course, 
was undoubtedly a fair amount of adrenaline on Eliezer's part as he
imagined Dave busy waiting for the fixes.  Better
review earlier in the process might have allowed some of these issues to be
found and fixed in a more relaxed manner.  But review bandwidth is, as
is the case in most projects, the most severely limited resource of all.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I should mention that some of the stuff that Linus asked me to remove, was added because of requests from earlier reviewers.<br>
<p>
Maybe, just like we give credit to reviewers, when we add their suggestion to the code, we should also credit them when Linus gets angry and asks to revert it. ;) <br>

Is POLL_BUSY_LOOP really a better name? Sure it does spell out the drawbacks very clearly, but it does so naming an implementation detail. Maybe at some point in the future we find another way to provide low latency device polling not using busy looping. Maybe it will be some fancy hardware feature or some new genius trick with new drawbacks. Applications probably will not care about how low latency is achieved, but the interface will then be misleading.<br>

Naming is hard, but if those are the only two choices then POLL_BUSY_LOOP is better.  The other name is too tempting and you'll always be having to explain it and why no one outside the financial industry should use it.  By naming it something scary you've cut your support costs dramatically.<br>
<p>
Honestly, there will always be people who want to busy loop, so you're right that it's an implementation detail but it's also probably not going to change.<br>

If there aren't drawbacks, the networking stack would just start using the feature regardless of what the application specifically cares about. If there are drawbacks, it might matter what they are. I mean, you can often improve latency by delivering corrupted packets instead of waiting for correct copies, but that's not a tradeoff everyone who wants low latency is willing to make.<br>

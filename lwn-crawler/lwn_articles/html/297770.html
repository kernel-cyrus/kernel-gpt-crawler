The <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">Linux Infrared Remote Control project</a>
(LIRC) provides drivers for a number of infrared receivers and
transmitters.  It is, perhaps, most heavily used by people running MythTV
and similar packages; it would, after all, completely ruin the experience
to have to get up from the couch to change channels.  Despite their
established user base, and despite the fact that a number of distributors
ship the code, the LIRC drivers have never found their way
into the mainline kernel.  In more recent times, little effort has gone
into their development and maintenance; the link to "Caldera OpenLinux" on
the project's web site would seem to make that clear.
<p>

But LIRC is useful code, and, as is the case with most out-of-tree drivers,
most people would really rather see LIRC in the mainline kernel.  Merging
into the mainline got a step closer on September&nbsp;9, when Jarod Wilson
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/297494/">posted a version of the LIRC
drivers</a> for consideration.  Jarod, it seems, has been working (with
Janne Grunau) on these drivers for some months; in the process, they have
eliminated "tens of thousands" of complaints from the checkpatch.pl script
and cleaned up a number of things.
<p>

Even after that work, though, the LIRC drivers are clearly not yet up to
normal kernel standards.  Some very strange coding conventions are used in
places.  Many of the drivers have broken (or completely absent) locking.
Duplicated code abounds.  One driver has implemented a command parser in
its <tt>write()</tt> function.  Another driver is for hardware which
already has a different driver in the mainline.  And, importantly, these
drivers do not work with the input subsystem.
<p>

<span class="PullQuote">
<span class="invisible">[PULL QUOTE: </span>
The LIRC
drivers would appear to strongly support the notion that out-of-tree code
is, almost by necessity, worse code.
<span class="invisible"> END QUOTE]</span>
</span>


In the past, Linus Torvalds (and others) have argued for merging drivers as
soon as possible.  If the code is poor, its chances of being improved get
much higher once it's in the mainline and others can fix it.  The LIRC
drivers would appear to strongly support the notion that out-of-tree code
is, almost by necessity, worse code.  These drivers have been around for
almost a decade, have been packaged by distributors, and have been used by
large numbers of people.  Despite all of that, they contain a large number
of serious problems which have never been addressed.
<p>

Now that the drivers have been posted to the linux-kernel list, quite a few
of these problems are being pointed out; Jarod and Janne have been
responding to reviews and fixing the issues.  The "merge drivers early"
philosophy would argue for pushing LIRC into 2.6.28, even if serious problems
remain.  Presence in the mainline will raise the visibility of the code,
inspiring (one hopes) more developers to work on fixing it up.  Merging
LIRC will also free distributors from the need to create separate packages
for those drivers.
<p>

One important question will have to be addressed before merging LIRC can be
seriously considered, though: its user-space API.  Once LIRC is merged, its
user-space API will be set in stone, so any problems with that API need to
be resolved first.  LIRC, being out of the mainline, did not follow the
development of the input subsystem, so it does not behave like other input
drivers - even in-tree drivers for infrared remotes.  The use of an in-kernel
command-line parser in at least one driver is sure to raise eyebrows; that
sort of interaction should really be handled via <tt>ioctl()</tt> or sysfs.
All told, it is hard to imagine this code being merged until the API
problems have been resolved.
<p>

Changing the LIRC API will, of course, lead to problems of its own.  There
is user-space code which depends on the current API; any changes will break
that code.  The kernel community will certainly understand this problem,
but is unlikely to be swayed by it.  There are a number of risks associated
with maintaining production kernel code out of the mainline tree; one of
those risks is that your established APIs will not be accepted by the
kernel development community.  So an API change may simply be part of the
cost of getting LIRC into the mainline at this late date.
<p>

It should be a cost worth paying.  Once LIRC is in the mainline, interested
developers will work to continue to bring the code up to kernel standards.
The community will maintain it going forward.  All Linux users will get the
LIRC drivers with their kernel, with no need to deal with external
packages.  Getting there may be a bit frustrating for users of remotes and
(especially) for the developers who have taken on the task of getting this
code into the mainline.  But, once it's done, remotes will just be more
normal hardware, supported by the kernel like everything else.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Wow, I remember using LIRC back in college, in the 2.2 kernel days, for a project in my "digital logic" class.  We built a circuit to read infrared signals on the RS-232 serial port, and I wrote a userspace daemon to read the LIRC signals and translate them into shell commands.  <br>
<p>
I had long since forgetten about this code.  It's almost unbelievable to me that it still hasn't been merged!<br>

Hooray for progress.  Here's to more progress, so that what gets merged is worth keeping around.  User base does not assure developer time for code fixes when something is functional, and badly-designed/sub-optimal -- but functional -- code has no better life in-tree now than it ever did.  Cf. devfs for the canonical example, albeit with what sounds like less active developer interest.  Do we have promise of active and ongoing maintainership?<br>
<p>
Haven't we been talking about raising the quality of kernel code?  Isn't this what -mm is for?  Does anyone remember the flack that Reiser4 got for bad interface paradigm and mis-features in the code?  Was that all just because Hans was an ungracious, arrogant, abrasive force in the community?  Don't we work with developers who are willing to work with us through the external patch trees to get the code to be suitable for the mainline, and then ship it?<br>

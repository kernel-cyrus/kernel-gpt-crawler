           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 5, 2018</br>
           </div>
Large data centers routinely use control groups to balance the use of the
available computing resources among competing users.  Block I/O bandwidth
can be one of the most important resources for certain types of workloads,
but the kernel's I/O controller is not a complete solution to the problem.
The upcoming <a href="/Articles/758964/">block I/O latency controller</a>
looks set to fill that gap in the near future, at least for some classes of
users.
<p>
Modern block devices are fast, especially when solid-state storage devices
are in use.  But some workloads can be even faster when it comes to the
generation of block I/O requests.  If a device fails to keep up, the length
of the request queue(s) will increase, as will the time it takes for any
specific request to complete.  The slowdown is unwelcome in almost any
setting, but the corresponding increase in latency can be especially
problematic for latency-sensitive workloads.
<p>
The kernel has <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18-rc3/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#io">a
block I/O controller</a> now, but it has a number of shortcomings.  It
regulates bandwidth usage, not latency; that can be good in settings where
users are being charged for higher bandwidth limits, but it is less useful
for workloads where latency matters.  If some groups do not use their full
bandwidth allocations, a block I/O device may go idle even though other
groups, which have hit their limits, have outstanding I/O requests.  The
block I/O controller also depends heavily on the CFQ I/O scheduler and
loses functionality in its absence.  It doesn't work at all with multiqueue
block devices — the type of devices most likely to be in use in settings
where the I/O controller is needed.
<p>
The I/O latency controller, written by Josef Bacik, addresses these
problems by regulating latency (instead of bandwidth) at a relatively low
level in the block 
layer.  When it is in use, each control group directory has an
<tt>io.latency</tt> file that can be used to set the parameters for that
group.  One writes a line to that file following this pattern:
<p>
<pre>
    major:minor target=<i>target-time</i>
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>major</tt> and <tt>minor</tt> identify the specific block device
of interest, and <tt>target-time</tt> is the maximum latency that this
group should experience (in milliseconds).
<p>
The controller tracks the actual latency seen by each group, using a
relatively short (100ms) window.  If a given group starts to miss its
target, all other peer groups with larger targets are throttled to free up
some bandwidth; the group with the tightest latency target is thus given
the highest priority for access to the device.  If all groups are meeting
their targets, no throttling is done, so no bandwidth should go to waste if
there is a need for it.
<p>
On its face, throttling block I/O seems like a straightforward task: if a
process needs to be slowed down, simply don't dispatch as many of its
requests to the device.  But block I/O is a bit strange in that much of it
is initiated outside of the context of the process that is ultimately
responsible for its creation.  One example is filesystem metadata
I/O, which is generated by the filesystem itself at a time of its own
choosing.  Slowing down that I/O may interfere with the filesystem's
ordering decisions and create locking problems — without slowing down the
target process at all.  I/O generated by swapping is another example; it is
generated when the kernel needs to reclaim memory, which may not be when
the process being swapped is actually running.  Slowing down swap I/O will
slow down the freeing of memory for other uses — not a particularly good
idea when the system is short of memory.
<p>
Kernel developers who introduce that kind of behavior have a relatively high
likelihood of needing to look for openings in the fast-food industry in the
near future.  So the latency controller does no such thing.  It <i>will</i>
delay I/O dispatch for I/O that is generated directly by a process running
inside a control group that is to be throttled.  So a process reading
rapidly from a file may find that its reads start taking longer when
throttling goes into effect, for example.
<p>
A different approach is needed for indirectly generated block I/O, though.
In such cases, the latency controller will record the amount of needed
delay in the control group itself.  Whenever a process running within that
group returns from a system call — a setting where it is known that no
locks are held — that process will be put to sleep for a period to pay back
some of that delay.  The sleep period can be as long as 250ms in
severe cases.  If I/O traffic eases up and throttling is no longer
necessary, any remaining delays will be forgotten.
<p>
In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180703151503.2549-13-josef@toxicpanda.com/">the
patch introducing the controller itself</a>, Bacik notes that using it
results in 
a slightly higher number of requests per second (RPS) overall, and a
significant reduction in variability of RPS rates over time.  There is
another interesting result, in that this controller can help to protect the
system against runaway processes:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Another test we run is a slow memory allocator in the unprotected
	group.  Before this would eventually push us into swap and cause
	the whole box to die and not recover at all.  With these patches we
	see slight RPS drops (usually 10-15%) before the memory consumer is
	properly killed and things recover within seconds.
</div>
<p>
The throttling, seemingly, slows the allocating process enough to allow the
OOM killer to do its job before the system runs completely out of memory.
<p>
This patch set has been through six revisions as of this writing, with some
significant changes in the implementation happening along the way.  That
work appears to be coming to a close, though.  It earned the elusive <a
href="/Articles/758966/"><tt>Quacked-at-by</tt> tag</a> from Andrew Morton,
and block maintainer Jens Axboe has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f2d28a6b-a4bf-f340-cf78-024fb5f3314b@kernel.dk/">indicated</a>
that it has been applied for the 4.19 development cycle.  So the latency
for the delivery of the block I/O latency controller would appear to be
three or four months at this point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sorry it's not entirely clear by my patches, but it isn't the kernel's OOM killer that kills the process, it's our OOMD service that monitors the pressure statistics in the cgroups (the pressure patches aren't upstream yet, as soon as they are I'll hook in the relevant stuff for blk-iolatency).  The in-kernel OOM killer is pretty terrible at knowing who to kill, which is why we get that stupid death spiral when we don't have cgroups in place to limit things.  OOMD is able to make smarter decisions based on the pressure numbers to know who's causing problems and kills the memory consumer when things get out of hand.<br>

      OOMD isn't released anywhere, as far as I know.  Johannes's pressure stall patches have been on my radar for a bit; I'll definitely write about those, but the current set is a bit old, so I've been waiting for a repost.

OOMD isn't open sourced yet, still waiting on the pressure patches to land upstream.  But it basically just watches the pressure statistics, waits for some threshold to be hit, murders anything that hits that threshold.  In our reproducer you'll see that the memory bomb application is spending more and more time waiting on memory, and when it passes the 80% mark it'll be killed.<br>

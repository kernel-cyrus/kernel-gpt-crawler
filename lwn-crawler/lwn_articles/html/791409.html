<h1>The TCP SACK panic</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">

<p>
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Selective_acknowledgments">Selective
acknowledgment</a> (SACK) is a technique used by TCP to help alleviate
congestion 
that can arise due to the retransmission of dropped packets.  It allows
the endpoints to describe which pieces of the data they have received,
so that only the missing pieces need to be retransmitted.  However, a bug
was recently found in the Linux implementation of SACK that allows remote
attackers to panic the system by sending crafted SACK information.
</p>

<p>
Data sent via TCP is broken up into multiple segments based on the maximum
segment size (MSS) specified by the other endpoint—or some other network
hardware in the path it traversed.  Those segments are
transmitted to that endpoint, which acknowledges that it has received
them.  Originally, those acknowledgments (ACKs) could only indicate
that it had received segments up to the first gap; so if one early
segment was lost (e.g. dropped due to congestion), the endpoint could only
ACK those up to the lost one.  The originating endpoint would have to
retransmit many segments that had actually been received in order to ensure
the data gets there; the status of the later segments is unknown,
so they have to be resent.
</p>

<p>
In simplified form, sender A might send segments 20-50, with segments 23 and 37
getting dropped along the way.  Receiver B can only ACK segments 20-22, so
A must send 23-50 again.  As might be guessed, if the link is congested
such that segments are being dropped, sending a bunch of potentially
redundant traffic is not going to help things.

<p>
Selective acknowledgment was created as a mechanism to eliminate the
redundant traffic.  It came about in 1996 from <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2018">RFC&nbsp;2018</a>.  The idea is
that receiver B can ACK 20-22, 24-36, and 38-50 so that A need only resend
23 and 37.  It seems like common sense at some level; if someone read off a
string of 30 words and you missed the third, you wouldn't ask them to
repeat the list starting at the third word.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep track of all of that, the network subsystem has some
bookkeeping to do.  It is in this record keeping that the bug was found.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1.12/source/include/linux/skbuff.h#L616"><tt>struct
sk_buff</tt></a> (typically called an SKB) is a kernel data structure that
is used to hold network data of various sorts, including for transmit
queues, receive queues, SACK queues, and more.  For reference, networking
maintainer David 
Miller has a <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html">nice
overview</a> (if somewhat dated) of how SKBs are used in the kernel.  Part
of the bookkeeping 
for TCP is to keep track of the 32KB (64KB on PowerPC) fragments that the
TCP data stream has been broken up into;  it is in the interaction between
fragments and SACK where the kernel went astray. 
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1.12/source/include/net/tcp.h#L797"><tt>struct
tcp_skb_cb</tt></a> is a control buffer that tracks various things about a
TCP packet, including the number of segments/fragments it has been broken
up into.  It does so
for the general segmentation offload (GSO) feature, which moves the
segmentation of the packets as low as it can in the network stack,
including possibly offloading it to the network hardware.  The number of
segments is stored in the <tt>tcp_gso_segs</tt> field, which
is a two-byte 
unsigned integer.  That works fine as long as the number of
segments doesn't go beyond 64K.
</p>

<p>
But that is just what can happen when SACK has been agreed upon by the
endpoints, which is done when the connection is established.  An attacker
can use a small MSS value
(perhaps the minimum of 48 bytes, which
only leaves eight bytes for actual user data) and cause an overflow of
<tt>tcp_gso_segs</tt> by carefully choosing which segments to
acknowledge.  Multiple SKBs will be coalesced by the kernel in order to
more efficiently 
process blocks of unacknowledged segments, but doing so could overflow
<tt>tcp_gso_segs</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
That overflow would cause a <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1/source/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L1299"><tt>BUG_ON()</tt> 
in <tt>tcp_shifted_skb()</tt></a> to be hit, leading to a kernel panic.
This was the most serious of four SACK-related bugs <a
href="https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001.md">found
by Jonathan Looney at Netflix</a>.  Two other Linux bugs were reported,
both leading to a SACK slowdown or excessive resource use, which could also lead
to a denial of 
service. There is also a SACK slowness problem that Looney identified in
FreeBSD&nbsp;12 when using the RACK TCP stack.  Netflix <a
href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/D15525">contributed</a> RACK to FreeBSD
just over a year ago.
</p>

<p>
The SACK panic has been designated as <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11477">CVE-2019-11477</a>;
it is clearly the most severe of the Linux problems.  <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11478">CVE-2019-11478</a>
is another denial of service; by crafting a sequence of SACKs, an attacker
can cause fragmentation of the TCP transmission queue, leading to higher
resource use.  <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11479">CVE-2019-11479</a>
points out that the MSS for Linux is set to 48, which means that a much larger
amount of CPU, memory, and bandwidth could be consumed in sending
relatively small amounts of user data.  The fix for that is to give the
administrator a sysctl knob to set the minimum value for MSS that the
kernel will accept; it is left at
48 by 
default for 
compatibility, but it can now be easily changed.
</p>

<p>
The problems have been addressed; the Netflix report has links to the
individual patches.  Those patches were released as part of the <a
href="/Articles/791289/">5.1.11, 4.19.52, 4.14.127, 4.9.182, and 4.4.182
stable updates</a> that were made on June&nbsp;17, the same day as the
embargo was lifted.  Distribution kernels have largely been updated at this
point, so those who can upgrade should probably do so.
</p>

<p>
There are various mitigations for the problems for those unable to update
on the spur of the moment.  Restricting
the MSS to a reasonable value <a
href="https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001/block-low-mss/iptables.txt">using iptables</a> or via <a
href="https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001/block-low-mss/README.md">other
means</a> will thwart these attacks, but those mitigations also require
disabling MTU 
probing by setting the
<tt>net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing</tt> sysctl to 0 for CVE-2019-11477 and
CVE-2019-11478.  Either of those CVEs can instead be thwarted by turning
off SACK 
by setting <tt>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack</tt> to 0.  To avoid
CVE-2019-11479, administrators
simply need to filter out MSS values that are too low using one of the
methods listed by Netflix.
</p>

<p>
The Red Hat <a
href="https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/tcpsack">vulnerability
report</a> has lots of useful details, as does the Netflix report mentioned
above.  A remote-control kernel crash is obviously a fairly nasty surprise
with potentially wide-ranging impact.  It is only the endpoints of a
connection that are affected, however, which limits the damage somewhat.
At least the servers and desktops <i>can</i> be updated, which may not be
true of all the gear our traffic visits on the way to its destination.

What was the fix for the panic? The article clearly laid out why the current code doesn't work, but I haven't seen what the new kernel does differently, and it seems like the LWN article would be a good place to record the post-fix behavior.<br>
<p>
As a less critical improvement, it would be great to eliminate BUG_ON from the networking subsystem. At worst, it should be possible to drop packets or close connections or bring down an interface, rather than dropping all the packets, closing all the connections, and bringing down all the interfaces, along with filesystems and userspace.<br>

The fix was to avoid coalescing queued skbs if this would cause the segment counter to overflow.<br>

<p>
BUG_ON means the programmer didn't think this error was possible (but wasn't sure) and doesn't know how to handle it. If the cause was a buffer overflow, for example, trying to clean up can make things worse.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; rather than dropping all the packets, closing all the connections, and bringing down all the interfaces, along with filesystems and userspace.</font><br>
<p>
In this case, sure, now we know how this goes wrong, it would obviously be better to kill the connection, but that probably wasn't so clear when the assertion was added.<br>

I'm really curious how Netflix happened across these vulnerabilities. Did they hit them in practice, did they find them through security testing, did they have some particular reason to be staring at this code...<br>

Notice how the security reports say FreeBSD and Linux:<br>

<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001.md">https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master...</a><br>
<p>
But FreeBSD did not release any security updates, how is that possible ?<br>
<p>
Turns out it is the FreeBSD 12 using the RACK TCP Stack:<br>

The RACK TCP Stack was created by Netflix for their FreeBSD based CDN applience:<br>

What's not clear to me is whether the overflow only occurs if segmentation offloading is enabled. According to Red Hat's advisory [1] this seems to be the case:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; When Segmentation offload is on and SACK mechanism is also enabled, due to packet loss and selective retransmission of some packets, SKB could end up holding multiple packets, counted by ‘tcp_gso_segs’.</font><br>
<p>
But neither Red Hat's nor this article mention disabling segmentation offloading as a mitigation. Hence I assume that the problematic "tcp_gso_segs" field can overflow even if segmentation offloading is disabled?<br>

So, what do you think now - if GSO turning off it will solve the problem (in linux ethtool -k ...) ?<br>
Or there is only right way to defend from this problem - turning off sack in /proc ?<br>

The old is new again. :/<br>
<p>
I remember back in late 2002 when a bug report for an Irix NFS server performance issue was nailed down to a serious SACK problem due to really small MSS windows being sent from a buggy NFS client implementation.<br>
<p>
The phrase "SACK panic" triggered my memory immediately because we used that phrase to describe what the reproducer we wrote did to the kernel. The Irix security patch release notes from early 2003 says it all:<br>
<p>
"* Denial of Service attack involving clients sending packets with very small MSS values"<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.xatrix.org/news/irix-ip-denial-of-service-fixes-and-tunings-2662/">http://www.xatrix.org/news/irix-ip-denial-of-service-fixe...</a><br>
<p>
That patch fixed a set of problems very similar to those being reported here....<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Do you think Linux should be tested against more Irix vulnerabilities?</font><br>
<p>
Actually the point I was making really has nothing to do with Irix - it was just the example that illustrated my point. i.e. that the OS networking community knew about these problems 15 years ago but that knowledge seems to have been lost and so we have repeated past mistakes....<br>
<p>
Which raises some interesting questions: where did that institutional knowledge go? Have all the network engineers of the time (like me) moved on to other things and so that knowledge has been (effectively) lost? How do we prevent the same flaw from being re-introduced and re-discovered in another 15 years?<br>
<p>
So, as much as you probably were poking fun at Irix with your comment, I'll point out that regression test suites are actually very good for retaining knowledge of flaws like this over the long term. i.e. new developers learn about them when their changes cause unexpected failures of tests that have been around for 15+ years....<br>

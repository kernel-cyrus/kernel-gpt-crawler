<p>
The stable tree was the topic for a plenary session led by Sasha Levin at
the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).
One of the main areas that needs attention is testing, according to Levin.
He wanted to discuss how to do more and better testing as well as to
address any concerns that attendees might have with regard to the stable tree.
</p>

<p>
There are two main things that Levin is trying to address with the stable
tree: that fewer regressions are released and that all of the
fixes get out there for users. In order to pick up fixes not marked for
stable, he is 
<a href="/Articles/764647/">using machine learning</a> to identify
candidate patches for the stable trees.  Those patches are reviewed
manually by him, then put on the relevant mailing list for at least a week;
if there 
are no objections, they will go into the stable tree, which is under review
for another week, then they are released.
</p>

<p>
There have been some concerns expressed that the stable kernel is growing
too much, by adding too many patches, which makes it less stable.  He strongly
disagrees with that as 
there is no magic limit on the number of patches that, if exceeded, leads
to an unstable kernel. It is more a matter of the kind of testing that is
being done on the patches proposed for the stable kernels.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Levin noted that Darrick Wong and Dave Chinner (neither of whom were
present at LSFMM this year) have expressed worries about the kind of
testing that takes place.  He has been working with them on trying to
improve the testing of stable patches for XFS and other filesystems.  
Luis Chamberlain (formerly Rodriguez) has been working on a new tool to run
<a href="https://github.com/kdave/xfstests">xfstests</a> on the stable
patches with various kernel configurations called <a
href="https://gitlab.com/mcgrof/oscheck">oscheck</a>; right  
now, it targets XFS, but 
Levin would like to see it expand to testing other filesystems and get
integrated with the <a href="https://kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a> project.
</p>

<p>
He does not have a good solution for testing I/O (or storage) and memory
management at this point, however.  There is the <a
href="https://github.com/osandov/blktests">blktests</a> framework for
storage testing, but he has not looked into it yet.  There is nothing
that he knows about for memory-management testing, however; he would be happy to
hear suggestions. 
</p>

<p>
Michal Hocko said that he was not happy with the idea of "automagic"
backports of memory-management patches for stable kernels.  He said that
the memory-management developers are quite careful to mark patches that
they think should make their way into the stable trees; adding others is
just adding risks.
</p>

<p>
There is no set of tests to detect regressions, he said; problems will not
be found until you run real workloads on top of those kernels.  There have
been several cases where dubious patches were picked up for stable, so he
does not think automatic patch selection should be used.  SUSE has found
that the stable trees are bringing in less stability and he thinks that is
because you need a human brain to evaluate each of the patches.
</p>

<p>
Levin said that he agrees that the memory-management developers do a
"great job" of marking patches for stable; there were only 26 other
memory-management patches in the last year that were proposed for the
stable tree.  Users expect that things may break a little bit in a stable
kernel, 
he said, but they are afraid of the big updates like moving to a new kernel
series.  That's why it takes months or years for users to upgrade to a new
kernel; if the changes are relatively small, it is less scary for users.
If kernel developers hide scary patches only in newer kernel series, users
simply won't upgrade—there are still users on 2.6.32, after all.
</p>

<p>
But if distributions aren't using the stable kernels, Rik van Riel asked,
who is?  Levin said that the enterprise distributions from Red Hat and SUSE
do not use them, but that Canonical, Android, and others do use the stable
kernels. 
</p>

<p>
Steve French said that there are multiple filesystems that regularly tested with
xfstests, including ext4, Btrfs, and SMB/CIFS. From his perspective it
is fine to include more patches into stable, but he wondered if there is a
mechanism to 
inform the filesystem developers that a regression test for a set of
patches needs to 
be run.  The developers could trigger such a test run if the
stable maintainers could point them at a branch, he said.
</p>

<p>
Filesystem developers are comfortable with backporting large sets of
patches when they 
are able to run their tests, but French said he does not know when the
stable kernels 
come out.  Levin said that he is happy to extend the timing of the release,
if needed; there are also ways to trigger builds and tests in other systems
based on a stable candidate.  French said that it takes around seven hours
to run the tests for SMB/CIFS; he is not sure how long it takes for ext4
and Btrfs, but suspects it is roughly the same.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that the automation piece is what is needed.  Currently, he
would need to see the stable release-candidate email, and then personally
download 
and build the kernel.  Once that has been done, running the tests is easy:
he uses nine virtual machines (VMs) and it takes about two or three hours
of wall-clock time.
Then some human needs to look at the results.  If it were automated or
someone were paid to do that work, it would happen; automating as much as
possible will help.
</p>

<p>
Levin again referred to the oscheck work that Chamberlain is doing.  Ext4
would make a nice addition to that, 
Levin said.  They are both willing to customize the process to make it easy for
additional filesystems to come on board.  It is mostly a matter of gathering
the right "expunge lists" (i.e. xfstests that should not be run) for ext4
and other filesystems.  In addition, those lists evolve as bugs are fixed,
features are added, and so on; Levin said that Chamberlain's tool has ways
to handle that.
</p>

<p>
Chris Mason wondered why the Intel <a
href="https://01.org/lkp/documentation/0-day-test-service">O-Day automated
testing</a> was not being 
used and that something new was being created instead.  Levin said that the
code for the 
Intel effort 
is only semi-open, so he has been working with KernelCI, which is all open
source; the goal is to 
integrate with that effort.  Chamberlain said that the 0-Day bot does run
xfstests, but expunge-list management is a problem area for it.
</p>

<p>
Levin said that he thinks that resources for running tests is becoming less
of an issue; KernelCI has money and resources for testing, for example.
Automated 
testing is cheaper; humans are needed to review code, but finding human
time for review is difficult in some subsystems.  Memory management is one
of those, so automated tests that could at least confirm that a stable
candidate "basically works" would be useful.
</p>

<p>
Mel Gorman said that it "will be tricky" to come up with such tests.  A
basic round of memory-management tests takes one or two days, while a
middling set takes three or four days; the full set of tests (which still
leaves some stuff out) takes two
weeks or so.  These tests require a lot of CPU time, though they are fully
automated.  Levin thought that three days for testing would be workable.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that mistakes in the memory-management subsystem manifest as
performance problems, so the tests measure performance in various ways,
Gorman said.  The results are "much more subtle" than a simple pass/fail as
other test suites have.  The full set of <a
href="https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests">MMTests</a> takes three weeks,
Gorman said.  It would be nice if there was a way to characterize whether
the tree has regressed "too much", Levin said, so that someone could start
looking at that.
</p>

<p>
Moving back to the filesystem tests, Ts'o said that managing the expunge
(or exclude) lists is going to be a major headache; it is not something
that Chamberlain can do alone.  Those files also need to be commented so
that it is clear why tests are being skipped.  Doing that kind of testing
will be an ongoing effort that requires a lot of humans, Ts'o said.
Chamberlain agreed, noting that he is currently handling XFS, but that
other people are needed for other filesystems.
</p>

<p>
The merits of an include list versus an exclude list were also discussed.
Ts'o said that an include list will never get updated when people get busy,
so new tests won't end up being run.  With an exclude list, failures are
noise that will get attention.  French said that it is important to test
with both kinds of lists, but it is equally important to collect and use
different  kernel
configurations. 
</p>

<p>
The matrix of exclude and include lists, along with local kernel
configurations, for each of the kernel series of interest is going to be
large, Levin said.  It is important to remember that most users are not
running the latest kernels, so bugs that get fixed in 5.x kernels are not
reaching users unless they are backported to older kernels, he said.  No
one is running the kernels released by Linus Torvalds other than perhaps on
their laptops, but certainly not at scale.
</p>

<p>
Experience from other test projects, such as the <a
href="https://linux-test-project.github.io/">Linux Test Project</a> (LTP),
shows that not running tests has its faults as well, Amir Goldstein said.
LTP annotates its tests with minimum kernel versions, but still runs them
expecting failure.  Chamberlain noted that he started by running all of the
tests, then documenting which failed and why.  But Ts'o said that may not
be workable in all cases; there are tests on the exclude list for xfstests
because they crash the kernel for certain configurations.  Or they take an
inordinate amount of time under certain configurations (e.g. 1KB block
size); that is why the exclude-list entries should be documented. 
</p>

<p>
As time expired for the session, Levin said he was hoping to talk to any
attendees who had thoughts about integrating tests they already use into
KernelCI.  If those tests get into the framework, the stable team can point
it at candidate trees to hopefully get better testing—and detect any
regressions—before the release.

What exactly is meant by stable here? Only the kernel trees marked as stable on kernel.org or the ones marked "longterm" as well? Are there many users for the older longterm versions? <br>
<p>
Canonical always seems to miss the LTS releases by one release with Ubuntu, 18.04 LTS uses 4.15 and also has packages for 4.18 (-edge for cloud users) and 5.0 (edge / HWE kernel). <br>

On "nobody" running the new kernel releases, this is where rolling distros like openSUSE Tumbleweed help somewhat, where at least starting with the .1 or .2 release you start getting real users on the new code. Sure, not at scale and maybe not even the ".0" or Linus release, but it's something at least.<br>

I would assume more people are running recent stable than people running vanilla LTS (or even a version of LTS). When I see old versions (usually in environments where people are conservative and generally complacent about upgrading) it's some Frankenkernel from an Enterprise distribution. <br>

I've run Rawhide before and that usually ends up being -rc0 as soon as a release is announced. That machine has been offline for quite a while now, but I doubt it has any non-rc kernels on it :) . Not sure how the Rawhide crowd size compares to Tumbleweed though.<br>

Indeed, it's very nice to have a few distros running *very* recent stable kernel.<br>
<p>
My comment was more about that no one runs *Linus's* tree, so while the process revolves around it, no one actually runs that tree, even the "cutting edge" distros wait until stable releases start popping out.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; My comment was more about that no one runs *Linus's* tree, so while the process revolves around it, no one actually runs that tree, even the "cutting edge" distros wait until stable releases start popping out.</font><br>
<p>
Hasn't it always been that way?  Previously distros were running the ac kernel from Alan Cox.  This is by design because Linus doesn't want that role.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The merits of an include list versus an exclude list were also discussed. Ts'o said that an include list will never get updated when people get busy, so new tests won't end up being run. With an exclude list, failures are noise that will get attention. French said that it is important to test with both kinds of lists, but it is equally important to collect and use different kernel configurations.</font><br>
<p>
What I've wanted to do for our setup is that it is a blacklist for failing/known "bad" tests. But each week, schedule a "run excluded tests" run. If any come back green, take them off the blacklist again.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Those files also need to be commented so that it is clear why tests are being skipped.</font><br>
<p>
Agreed. Our blacklists used to be very ad hoc and without a way to tell what's up (issue links are best), the tests just rot on that platform combination.<br>

<p>
If failing / bad tests show up as green then I think it's a good idea to investigate why that has happened.<br>
<p>
If they've genuinely been fixed then that's good, but if there has not been a targeted fix for the problem then making sure it hasn't caused a false positive is important.<br>

Of course. Our exclusion list is maintained by hand, so any removals would presumably go with an analysis of the now-passing tests and a commit message.<br>

Would be nice to see more organizations supporting KernelCI. They're currently trying to get more corporate support to fund scaling their infrastructure and coverage.<br>

The nice thing about virtual-memory systems is that the physical placement
of memory does not matter — most of the time.  There are situations,
though, where physically contiguous memory is needed; operating systems
often struggle to satisfy that need.  At the 2016 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, two brief sessions discussed
issues relating to a pair of techniques used to ensure access to physically
contiguous memory: the <a href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous memory
allocator (CMA)</a> and <a href="/Articles/368869/">compaction</a>.
<p>
<h4>CMA troubles</h4>
<p>
Aneesh Kumar started off the CMA session by bringing up a problem that
comes up when 
running virtualized guests under KVM on PowerPC systems.  The hardware page
table for such guests must be stored in a large, contiguous memory region,
which can 
be hard to come by after the system has been running for a while and memory
has become fragmented.  The solution is to use CMA, which reserves a region
of memory for these allocations, to allocate this page table.  But things
don't work quite as desired.
<p>
One problem is that, if the kernel is doing a lot of movable allocations
(those that can be relocated if need be), the kernel will go into reclaim
far earlier than it should.  By the design of CMA, the kernel should be
able to obtain movable allocations within
the CMA area, since they can be moved out
should a need for a large contiguous area arise.  The kernel tends to avoid
the CMA area, though, leading to situations where the system behaves like
it's out of memory while much of the CMA area remains free.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/633101/"><tt>ZONE_CMA</tt> patches</a> are meant to
address this problem.  They put the CMA area into a separate memory zone
that is available for movable allocations.  But, Aneesh reported, using
<tt>ZONE_CMA</tt> just replaces one set of problems with another.
Allegedly movable allocations become pinned in place when an application
places them under I/O or locks them with <tt>mlock()</tt>.  The compaction
code will not relocate compound pages (transparent huge pages, for
example).  The result is that the CMA area becomes unfixably fragmented and
CMA allocations fail, defeating the original purpose.  So users like Aneesh
are left wondering what other approaches they can try.
<p>
Mel Gorman came in at this point with a bit of a lecture; according to him,
the <tt>ZONE_CMA</tt> approach is simply not acceptable.  Memory zones exist
to deal with addressing limitations — whether the memory can be used
for DMA, for example — and should not be used for other purposes.  Like
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>, which is in the kernel now, <tt>ZONE_CMA</tt> just
brings a new set of problems with it.  <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> was a mistake,
he said, one which should not be repeated here.
<p>
The better solution, he said, would be to migrate pages out of the CMA area
prior to pinning them.  In addition, page blocks (large groups of pages
used to try to keep similar allocation types together) could gain a sticky
<tt>MIGRATE_MOVABLE</tt> bit that would prevent nonmovable allocations from
being performed there.  Finally, if problems remain, the <a href="/Articles/211505/">lumpy
reclaim mechanism</a> should be brought back to help clean up the mess.  There
was some talk about the details, but it seemed to be generally agreed that
this was the direction to go to improve the interaction between CMA and the
rest of the memory-management subsystem.
<p>
<h4>Compaction</h4>
<p>
"Compaction" is the process of shifting pages of memory around to create
contiguous areas of free memory.  It helps the system's ability to satisfy
higher-order allocations, and is crucial for the proper functioning of the
transparent huge pages (THP) mechanism.  Vlastimil Babka started off the session
on compaction by noting that it is not invoked by default for THP
allocations, making those allocations harder to satisfy.  That led to some
discussion of just where compaction should be done.
<p>
One option is the <tt>khugepaged</tt> thread, whose job is to collapse sets
of small pages into huge pages.  It might do some compaction on its own,
but it can be disabled, which would disable compaction as well.  Thus,
<tt>khugepaged</tt> cannot guarantee that background compaction will be
done.  The <tt>kswapd</tt> thread is another possibility, but Rik van Riel
pointed out that it tends to be slow for this purpose, and it can get stuck
in a shrinker somewhere waiting for a lock.  Another possibility, perhaps
the best one, is <a href="/Articles/650051/">a separate <tt>kcompactd</tt>
thread</a> dedicated to this particular task.
<p>
Michal Hocko said that he ran into compaction problems while working on the 
<a href="/Articles/668126/">out-of-memory detection</a> problem.  He found
that the compaction code 
is hard to get useful feedback from; it "does random things and returns
random information."  It has no notion of costly allocations, and makes
decisions that are hard to understand.
<p>
Part of the problem, he said, is that compaction was implemented for the
THP problem and is focused a little too strongly there.  THP requires
order-9 (i.e. "huge") pages; if the compaction code cannot create such a
page in a given area, it just gives up.  The system needs contiguous
allocations of smaller sizes, down to the order-2 (four-page) allocations needed for
<tt>fork()</tt> to work, but the compaction code doesn't care about
creating contiguous chunks of that size.  A similar problem comes from the
"skip" bits used to mark blocks of memory that have proved
resistant to compaction.  They are an optimization meant to head off
fruitless attempts at compaction, but they also prevent successful,
smaller-scale compaction.  Hacking the compaction code to ignore the skip
bits leads to better results overall.
<p>
Along the same lines, compaction doesn't even try with page blocks that
hold unmovable allocations.  As Mel pointed out, that was the right
decision for THP, since a huge page cannot be constructed from such a
block, but it's the wrong thing to do for smaller allocations.  It might be
better, he said, for the compaction code to just scan all of memory and do
the best it can.
<p>
There was some talk of adding flexibility to the compaction code so that it
will be better suited for more use cases.  If the system is trying to
obtain huge pages for THP, compaction should not try too hard or do
anything too expensive.  But if there is a need for order-2 blocks to keep
things running, compaction should try a lot harder.  One option here would
be to have a set of flags describing what the compaction code is allowed to
do, much like the "GFP flags" used for memory allocation requests.  The
alternative, which seemed to be more popular, is to have a single
"priority" level controlling compaction behavior.
<p>
The final topic of discussion was the process of finding target pages when
compaction decides to migrate a page that is in the way.  The current
compaction code works from both ends of a range of memory toward the
middle, trying to accumulate free pages at one end by migrating pages to
the other end.  But it seems that, in some settings, scanning for the
target pages takes too long; it was suggested that, maybe, those pages
should just come from the free list instead.  Mel worried, though, that
such a scheme could result in two threads doing compaction just moving the
same pages back and forth; the two-scanner approach was designed to avoid
that.  There was some talk of marking specific blocks as migration targets,
but it is not clear that work in this area will be pursued.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

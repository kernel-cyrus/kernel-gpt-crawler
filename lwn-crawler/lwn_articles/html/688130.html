<p>
Radix trees have been a part of Linux for quite some time;
an <a href="/Articles/175432/">LWN article</a> from a decade ago explained
the structure and functionality of them.  The radix tree is a general-purpose
data structure that is 
used by many different components within the kernel.  It provides an efficient
way to create a key-value store, where the key is an <tt>unsigned
long</tt>, referred to as the <tt>index</tt>, and the value is a
<tt>void&nbsp;*</tt>.  The radix tree also stores a few bits of additional
information for each entry in the form of tags.

<p>
The most common use of the radix tree is to keep track of a collection of
pages.  In <tt>struct address_space</tt>, for example, there is a radix tree
called <tt>page_tree</tt> that tracks the in-memory page-cache pages
that are associated with a given inode.  The key for <tt>page_tree</tt> is the
page offset (<tt>pgoff_t</tt>) into the file.  For normal files,
<tt>page_tree</tt> will map that key to a <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> value which is
actually the <tt>struct page&nbsp;*</tt> for the page-cache page at that file offset.
For page-cache pages, the radix-tree tags let us track
entries that are dirty and which are marked for writeback.

<p>
For inodes that take advantage of the
<a href="/Articles/610174/">DAX</a> ("direct access")
feature,
there is no page cache sitting between the user processes and the
storage.  Hence, for DAX inodes there is no need to keep track of
<tt>struct page&nbsp;*</tt> entries via the <tt>page_tree</tt>. 
Instead, for DAX inodes, this same <tt>page_tree</tt> is used to hold DAX
exceptional entries that track the state of the persistent-memory pages used by
DAX.  
  On x86_64, these exceptional entries are 64-bit values that
  store several pieces of information, such as the page size (more on that
  below), the sector offset within the persistent-memory storage, and
  some flags.
From these exceptional entries, DAX knows which dirty pages need to
be flushed from the processor cache when an <tt>fsync()</tt> is received
from user space.

<p>
For radix-tree uses where there is a one-to-one mapping between keys and
values, such as a <tt>page_tree</tt> that only tracks <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> page-cache entries and/or DAX entries, this all works perfectly.  But what about
cases where this one-to-one relationship breaks down? 

<p>
One example of this breakdown is huge pages.  On x86_64, regular pages are 4KiB
in size.  Linux x86_64 also supports "huge pages" that are 2MiB in size, and
the Linux DAX code has explicit support for these 2MiB pages.  For the
<tt>page_tree</tt> radix tree, this means that the one-to-one relationship
between keys and values may not be sufficient.

<p>
There is a desire for a 2MiB page to be tracked as a single
entity.  There would be a single pointer to the 2MiB worth of data and the
tag state would be consistent, so that the kernel can reliably track whether the
data is dirty.

<h4>Existing solutions</h4>

<p>
As of kernel 4.5, DAX successfully tracks the value and state of 2MiB pages
through 
the use of DAX exceptional radix-tree entries that reserve a few bits to record
whether the DAX entry represents a 4KiB page (<tt>RADIX_DAX_PTE</tt>) or a
2MiB page (<tt>RADIX_DAX_PMD</tt>).  2MiB page entries (referred to as
"Page Middle Directory" or PMD entries) are always inserted
at a 
2MiB boundary, so DAX is able to support huge-page entries with the following
logic:

<p>
<pre>
    pgoff_t pmd_index = DAX_PMD_INDEX(index);

    entry = radix_tree_lookup(page_tree, pmd_index);

    if (entry &amp;&amp; RADIX_DAX_TYPE(entry) == RADIX_DAX_PMD)
	    /* operate on the 2MiB 'entry' at 'pmd_index' */
    else
	    entry = radix_tree_lookup(page_tree, index);
	    /* operate on the 4KiB 'entry' at 'index' */
</pre>

<p>
This has the obvious cost that for every radix-tree operation there has to be an
extra lookup for the entry using <tt>pmd_index</tt> to first check
whether the index is covered by a 2MiB page.
  This solution is correct, but is somewhat costly in the
  <tt>RADIX_DAX_PTE</tt> case 
  where we have to do a <tt>radix_tree_lookup()</tt> at both
  <tt>pmd_index</tt> and <tt>index</tt>.  Having special-case lookups at
  multiple offsets also does not make for the cleanest code.
  When 1GiB page support is added to the DAX code, this solution
begins to look 
even worse, because there will have to be yet another special-case lookup.

<p>
Another possible alternative that would not involve an extra lookup would be to
represent the 2MiB entry via 512 redundant entries, each at a unique index.
This would have the property that any lookup for the indices in the 2MiB range
would return a copy of the data pointer, but it has the downside that the tag
tracking is no longer consistent among the 512 entries.  This would mean that
some of the 512 entries could be tagged as clean and some of them could be
tagged as dirty, even though they all had the same data pointer as their value.

<p>
There would also be a need to be sure to replicate other operations, such
as removal, 
among all 512 entries.  This solution has the additional downside that
representing a 2MiB page via 512 individual entries adds many extra nodes to
the radix tree.

<h4>Multi-order radix-tree techniques</h4>

<p>
Both of the solutions mentioned thus far for dealing with huge pages have left
the radix-tree API unchanged.  Ideally, there would be a solution where 
the one-to-one mapping between keys and values in the radix tree can be
broken.  That would allow
inserting an entry that covers multiple 4KiB-sized
indices and have operations on indices in that range, such as lookup, tag
modification, and removal, all act on the same radix-tree entry.   

Recently there have been several patch series (<a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/1/19/363">1</a>, 
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/6/718">2</a>, and 
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/14/522">3</a>)
posted to the Linux kernel mailing list that set out to accomplish this goal
via a solution that is called "the multi-order radix tree".

<p>
The basic idea is to add the  ability to insert
entries that span 2<sup>X</sup> 4KiB-sized page indices.  X is referred to as
the page's "order". Using this terminology, existing radix trees, in which every

entry is associated with a single index, are composed entirely of order-0
entries.  An order-2 entry would cover 2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 adjacent
indices.  The 
2MiB entries for the DAX huge-page example would be order-9
entries, and so on.</p>

<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/mo_radix_tree_1.png" width=213 height=137
alt="[sibling pointer]" border=0 hspace=5 align="left">

This new functionality is implemented in the multi-order radix tree using a
pair of techniques: sibling entries and elevated entries.
The smallest multi-order entry is an order-1 entry that covers two adjacent
indices.  This is implemented by inserting a special "sibling pointer" for the
second index that points back to the actual radix-tree entry.</p>

<p>
In this case, lookups, removals, and tag operations on both the base index
and on 
the index for the sibling operate on the same actual entry in a way that is
transparent to the user.  For orders greater than 1, there can simply be
multiple 
sibling entries that all point back to the actual radix-tree entry:

<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/mo_radix_tree_2.png" width=688 height=391 alt="[multi-order radix 2]" border=0>
</center>

<p>
With a multi-level radix tree, there can be up to
three different types of pointers.  The first are internal pointers, which
point from a parent radix-tree node to a child radix-tree node.  The second are 
sibling pointers, which point from one entry in a given radix-tree node to
another entry in that same node.  The third are the <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> data
pointers that are stored as part of the key-value store.

<p>
The lowest bit of the radix-tree entry,
<tt>RADIX_TREE_INTERNAL_NODE</tt>, is used to distinguish between the
<tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> 
data pointers and the two types of pointers internal to the radix-tree
implementation.  Sibling pointers and internal
node-to-node pointers are distinguished by looking at the value of the
pointer itself.  If the 
pointer points within the same node's <tt>slots</tt>
array, it is a sibling pointer.  If not, it points to a child radix-tree node.

<p>
If the fan-out of the radix tree happens to match the order of the multi-order
entry, it can be represented using an elevated entry that simply lives as a
child of one of the intermediate nodes in the tree:

<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/mo_radix_tree_3.png" width=626 height=367 alt="[multi-order radix 3]" border=0>
</center>

<p>
Elevated multi-order entries can be the children of intermediate nodes at any
level in the tree.
Combining these two techniques allows us to have elevated multi-order entries
with sibling pointers:

<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/mo_radix_tree_4.png" width=626 height=367 alt="[multi-order radix 4]" border=0>
</center>

<p>
Having both sibling entries and elevated entries allows the radix tree to
support multi-order entries of any order.

<h4>Radix-tree API changes</h4>

<p>
To use this new functionality, the multi-order radix tree has a few small API
changes where an <tt>order</tt> parameter was needed.

<p>
<pre>
    int __radix_tree_create(struct radix_tree_root *root, unsigned long index,
			    unsigned order, struct radix_tree_node **nodep,
			    void ***slotp);

    int __radix_tree_insert(struct radix_tree_root *, unsigned long index,
			    unsigned order, void *);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>__radix_tree_create()</tt> is only used in one place in
<tt>mm/filemap.c</tt>, and <tt>__radix_tree_insert()</tt> is a new API added by
the multi-order patches.  <tt>radix_tree_insert(),</tt> the old insertion API
that is used by all existing code, is now defined to be:

<p>
<pre>
    static inline int radix_tree_insert(struct radix_tree_root *root,
			    unsigned long index, void *entry)
    {
	    return __radix_tree_insert(root, index, 0, entry);
    }
</pre>

<p>
The API for operations such as node lookup, deletion, tag manipulation, etc.
remain unchanged.  This has allowed the multi-order radix tree to be
implemented with very little change to existing radix-tree users.

<h4>Integration with DAX 2MiB support</h4>

<p>
I recently posted a 
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/14/865">patch</a>
that integrates the DAX code with the new multi-order radix-tree code.  As can
be seen from that patch, the changes needed to move from the old method for
supporting 2MiB pages to the new multi-order radix-tree support are quite small.

<p>
We now insert an order-9 entry when we need to track the status of a 2MiB huge
page.  This is done as follows:

<p>
<pre>
    error = __radix_tree_insert(page_tree, index,
                    RADIX_DAX_ORDER(pmd_entry),
                    RADIX_DAX_ENTRY(sector, pmd_entry));
</pre>

<p>
<tt>RADIX_DAX_ORDER()</tt> gives us an order of 0 for 4KiB pages and an order
of 9 for 2MiB pages.

<p>
For the rest of the radix-tree operations, like lookup and tag
manipulation, there is
no longer a need to first check for a 2MiB PMD entry as a special case.  It just
operates on the radix tree using the index and the radix tree will do
the right thing if that index happens to map to a multi-order entry.

<p>
One last thing worth noting is that the multi-order radix tree API currently
does not define a way for the user to query the order of a given entry.  It is
not immediately obvious whether this API is actually needed.  The DAX code can
infer the order of a given entry by looking at its type: <tt>RADIX_DAX_PTE</tt>
or <tt>RADIX_DAX_PMD</tt>.  When multi-order <tt>struct
page</tt> entries start being inserted, their size can most likely be
understood by looking 
at the page flags.  However, if an API to query an entry's order proves useful,
it could easily be added.

<h4>In conclusion</h4>

  The multi-order radix tree patches have been present in both 
  Andrew Morton's -mm tree
  as well as
  Stephen Rothwell's linux-next tree
  for several weeks; they were pushed upstream during the
  4.7 merge 
  window.
  The integration between DAX PMD entries and the new multi-order radix-tree code 
  will be merged in 4.8 or later, and will need to take into account the
  recent <a href="/Articles/687541/">DAX page-fault-locking</a>
  patch series from Jan Kara.  The combination of the multi-order radix-tree
  patches and the locking changes will allow DAX to have locks on a per-page
  basis, regardless of the size of the page.

<p>
  DAX will most likely be the first user of the new multi-order capability of
  the radix tree, but these changes should be interesting to anyone who deals
  with multiple page sizes.  The transparent-huge-page code could probably
  make use of this new functionality, and it is likely that other users will
  spring up over time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hi Ross,<br>
<p>
Good write-up; thanks for doing this.  I'll be presenting at LinuxCon North America on the Radix Tree (not exclusively about the multi-order support, although that will be part of the talk).<br>
<p>
It's interesting that you see the radix tree as implementing a key-value store.  I think of it as being a resizable array of pointers (which merely happens to be implemented as a tree).<br>
<p>
For DAX, you're probably going to need to split 2MB entries into 4kB entries (eg on truncate).  You might also want to merge 4kB entries into 2MB entries on expansion, but that's not a correctness issue.  I have patches for the radix tree to support those two functions here: <a href="http://git.infradead.org/users/willy/linux-dax.git/shortlog/refs/heads/radix-huge-2016-04-25">http://git.infradead.org/users/willy/linux-dax.git/shortl...</a> (I have a few minor improvements to that which I haven't published yet)<br>
<p>
I hope you're talking to Kirill &amp; Hugh about their plans for file-backed THP.<br>
<p>
We have talked about other users of the radix tree using the multiorder support.  In general, anyone who's using multiple contiguous indices to return the same result might benefit.  Although they might also benefit from using a different kind of tree entirely ;-) [eg the RB tree used for mapping virtual addresses to struct vmas].<br>

Hey Matthew,<br>
<p>
Thanks! Have fun at LinuxCon North America - I'm sorry to miss your presentation.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure if I always though of the radix tree as a key-value store, but after the multi-order changes I definitely do. I see your alternate view, though.<br>
<p>
Yep, I agree on the need for 'split' and 'join' operations for multi-order entries.  I haven't yet had time to review your changes - are you planning on sending them to the list?<br>
<p>
Thanks for the comments, and hope you're well.<br>

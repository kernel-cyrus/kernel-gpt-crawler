           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 6, 2018</br>
           </div>
The kernel's staging tree is meant to be a path by which substandard code
can attract increased developer attention, be improved, and eventually find
its way into the mainline kernel.  Not every module graduates from 
staging; some are simply removed after it becomes clear that nobody cares
about them.  It is rare, though, for a project that is actively developed
and widely used to be removed from the staging tree, but that may be about
to happen with the <a href="http://lustre.org/">Lustre</a> filesystem.
<p>
The staging tree was <a href="/Articles/285594/">created</a> almost exactly
ten years ago as a response to the ongoing problem of out-of-tree drivers
that had many users but which lacked the code quality to get into the
kernel.  By 
giving such code a toehold, it was hoped, the staging tree would help it to
mature more quickly; in the process, it would also provide a relatively
safe place for aspiring kernel developers to get their hands dirty fixing
up the code.  By some measures, staging has been a great success: it has
seen nearly 50,000 commits contributed by a large community of developers,
and a number of drivers have, indeed, shaped up and moved into the
mainline.  The "ccree" TrustZone CryptoCell driver <a
href="/Articles/749676/">graduated from staging</a> in 4.17, for 
example, and the visorbus driver moved to the mainline in 4.16.
<p>
Other code has been less fortunate, though.  The gdm72xx, dgap, and
olpc_dcon drivers were all deleted in 4.6 due to a lack of
interest, and a whole set of RDMA drivers was deleted in&nbsp;4.5.  The
COMEDI driver set has received over 8,500 changes since it entered the
staging tree, but has still not managed to graduate; it has seen less than
100 patches in the last year.  Placement in the staging tree is clearly not
a guarantee that a driver will improve enough to move into the mainline.
<p>
Then there is the Lustre filesystem, which was added to the staging tree
just over five years ago for the 3.11 release.  Lustre has a rather longer
history than that, though; it was started by the prolific Peter Braam in
1999.  It was eventually picked up by Sun Microsystems, then suffered death
by Oracle in 2010.  In more recent times, its development has been managed
by <a href="http://opensfs.org/">OpenSFS</a>; it seems to have a strong
following in industries needing a high-end distributed filesystem for
high-performance computing applications.
<p>
As of 4.17, there have been 3,778 patches applied to the Lustre filesystem
in the staging tree.  A full 33% of those have come from Intel employees, and
11% from Outreachy interns.  But this work has not yet managed to make
Lustre ready to move out of the staging tree, and the associated <a
href="/Articles/756661/"><tt>TODO</tt> file</a> remains long.  It's not clear when
Lustre will be brought into shape.
<p>
Indeed, it may never happen.  Greg Kroah-Hartman, the maintainer of the
staging tree, is now <a href="/Articles/756629/">pushing</a> to remove
Lustre outright:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	While it has been an endless source of enjoyment for new kernel
	developers learning how to do basic codingstyle cleanups, as well
	as an semi-entertaining source of bewilderment from the vfs
	developers any time they have looked into the codebase to try to
	figure out how to port their latest api changes to this filesystem,
	it has not really moved forward into the "this is in shape to get
	out of staging" despite many half-completed attempts.
</div>
<p>
Removal from the mainline would, Kroah-Hartman said, allow it to proceed
forward at full speed; the project could then return once its code-quality
issues have been addressed.
<p>
One of the obvious problems with Lustre is its sheer size; at just under
200,000 lines of code, it's not something that is going to be cleaned up
quickly.  With that size comes quite a bit of complexity; highly scalable
distributed filesystems are not simple, and beginning developers cannot really
be expected to make substantive changes to them.
<p>
But the other problem, according to Kroah-Hartman, is that development of
Lustre is not actually happening in the staging tree.  Instead, the Lustre
project maintains its own external tree and makes regular releases outside
of the mainline cycle.  The <a
href="http://lustre.org/lustre-2-11-0-released/">2.11.0 release</a>, for
example, came out in early April and added a number of new features.  Some
of the work done in the Lustre repository is sporadically brought over to
the copy in the staging tree, but that tree is clearly not the focus of
development.  As Kroah-Hartman commented: "<q>This dual-tree development
model has never worked, and the state of this codebase is proof of
that</q>".
<p>
Some developers (<a href="/Articles/756631/">Christoph Hellwig</a>, for
example) applauded this move.  Unsurprisingly, the Lustre developers are
somewhat less enthusiastic.  Andreas Dilger <a
href="/Articles/756632/">argued</a> that, as a filesystem with thousands of
users, its code should be in the mainline (though Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/Articles/756633/">countered</a> that none of those users are running
the staging version of the code) and that Lustre has improved considerably
over the years.  Neil Brown, who has contributed many improvements to
Lustre, is also <a href="/Articles/756634/">against its removal</a>,
fearing that it would never return afterward.
<p>
What will happen next is unclear.  It may be that Kroah-Hartman's real
purpose was to light a fire underneath the project and force some action
rather than the actual deletion of the code.  But there is little doubt
that Lustre will eventually find itself staged out if the pace of
improvement (and perhaps its development model in general) does not
change.  Staging is meant to be an entry point into the kernel, not a
halfway house where code remains indefinitely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As I was reading this, I was thinking "removal because of slow progress on TODOs seems a bit harsh", then I got to this line:<br>

Been using Lustre for years, to finally ditch it after the tons of headaches it gave it trying to keep up with the kernel and dragging Lustre behind.<br>
<p>
Like it has been said, the staging tree has never been anything else than a poor reflection of its out-of-sync being-actively-worked-on counterpart, which itself was a pain to make work with reasonably up-to-date kernels.<br>
<p>
I would almost say «good riddance». But it's a pity such a great product - from the HPC performances point of view - failed to make it to a kernel first class citizen.<br>

"failed" has such finality to it - "has not yet succeeded" would be better.<br>
<p>
Hopefully, as Greg suggests, it can now "proceed forward at full speed".<br>

I work in staging and comedi could graduate at any point so far as I'm concerned.  No one would object.  The patch slowdown is because it's basically nice code now.  I don't know why Ian hasn't asked for it.<br>

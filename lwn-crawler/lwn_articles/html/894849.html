Memory reclaim in Linux is largely a reactive practice; the kernel tries to
find memory it can repurpose in response to the amount of free memory
falling too low.  Developers have often wondered if a proactive reclaim
mechanism might lead to better performance, for some workloads at least,
and optimal use of tiered-memory systems will likely require more active
reclamation of memory as well.  At the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Davidlohr Bueso
led a brief session on the topic.
<p>
Bueso started by suggesting the addition of a per-node knob that would
enable proactive reclaim; an administrator would write a number indicating
the amount of memory that should be reclaimed, and the kernel would attempt
to make it happen.  It might also be possible, he said, to extend the
debugfs knob added by the <a href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational
LRU patches</a> rather than adding a new knob.  Michal Hocko opposed that
latter idea, though, saying that he did not want to make anything in
debugfs into an API that would have to be maintained.

<a href="/Articles/894857/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/DavidlohrBueso-sm.png" alt="[Davidlohr Bueso]"
title="Davidlohr Bueso" class="rthumb"></a>
<p>

Instead, Hocko said, a knob of this sort should be put into sysfs.  There
are two ideas for how this control could work: there could be a single knob
that would accept a mask indicating which nodes to target for reclaim, or
there could be a per-node knob as described by Bueso.  Hocko likes the
per-node knob idea better, since it provides better control to the
administrator.  Johannes Weiner said that he has tried to add a similar
sort of knob to the control-group memory controller; it would accept a
count of pages to reclaim from a given group.  That controller does
round-robin reclaim across the processes contained within the group, which
might be good enough, he said.  He suggested testing this mechanism on
tiered-memory systems to see how it works.
<p>
Bueso asked whether that sort of interface can be counted on to work in the
future; not every system uses control groups in this way, and control at
the global level might be handled differently.  Weiner said that users want
all of the features in both the global and control-group settings, so there
should not be any divergence there.
<p>
Another attendee pointed out a couple of other use cases for proactive
reclaim.  Migration of virtual machines will go faster if there are fewer
pages to copy, so administrators would like to be able to force a virtual
machine to reclaim as much memory as possible before the migration begins.
The virtual machine can report which pages have been freed to the
hypervisor, and those pages can be left out of the copy to the new host.  A
similar use case is suspend-to-disk, which will happen more quickly if
there are a lot of free pages that need not be written to persistent
storage.
<p>
Bueso turned the topic to testing of proactive-reclaim mechanisms; there
are a lot of ideas going around, he said, but not a lot of numbers showing
how well they actually work.  For example, he likes the hot-page selection
algorithm that is part of the <a href="/Articles/893024/">tiered-memory
work</a>, but there is only one benchmark result that gives any information
on its performance.  The minimal approach to benchmarking appears to be the
standard for this kind of work, he said, and that worries him.
<p>
He continued with a request for an easier way to subject a patch set to a
variety of workloads.  He has been hacking on <a
href="https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests">MMTests</a> toward that end,
trying to get an indication of just when a workload starts to push pages
out of DRAM and into a slower memory tier.  That helps to know whether the
tiering algorithm is actually working, he said.  But he would like to find
a way to add tests that exercise the memory-management subsystem in ways
beyond just consuming lots of RAM.
<p>
As the session wound down, he also said that he would like a way to export
the kernel's view of the various memory tiers to user space.  The consensus
seemed to be that a sysfs file should be added for that purpose.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is very interesting, I remember Andrea worked something in these line some time ago:<br>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/833511/">https://lwn.net/Articles/833511/</a><br>
<p>
Not sure if Bueso&#x27;s approach would be similar or could share concepts...<br>

Thanks for the good summary!<br>

/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches sometimes is just too much, you may want to reclaim memory only partially, ideally only from certain cgroups in order to create different tiers / priorities of memory reclaiming groups in the system. <br>
<p>
For example you may want to use this feature to apply a more aggressive memory reclaim to low priority cgroups (i.e. background apps) and a less aggressive memory reclaim policy to high priority cgroups (i.e. foreground apps). The same concept can be applied to containers, cloud instances, etc.<br>
<p>
I think that having such control in user-space on a per-cgroup basis can bring some real benefits to a lot of different scenarios. <br>

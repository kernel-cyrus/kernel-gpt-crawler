           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 24, 2012</br>
           </div>
Locking and the associated possibility of deadlocks are a challenge for
developers working anywhere in the kernel.  But that challenge appears to
be especially acute in the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer, where the needs
of many collaborating subsystems all come together in one place.  The
difficulties inherent in VFS locking were highlighted recently when the
proposed <a href="/Articles/488906/">IMA appraisal extension</a> ran into
review problems.
The proposed fix shows that, while these issues can be worked around, the
solution is not necessarily simple.
<p>
The management of <tt>file</tt> structure reference counts is done with
calls to <tt>fget()</tt> and <tt>fput()</tt>.  A <tt>file</tt> structure,
which represents an open file, can depend on a lot of resources: as long as
a file is open, the kernel must maintain its underlying storage device,
filesystem, network protocol information, security-related information,
user-space notification requests, and more.  An <tt>fget()</tt> call will
ensure that all of those resources stay around as long as they are needed.
A call to <tt>fput()</tt>, instead, might result in the destruction of any
of those resources.  For example, closing the last file on an unmounted
filesystem will cause that filesystem to truly go away.
<p>
What all this means is that a call to <tt>fput()</tt> can do a lot of work,
and that work may require the acquisition of a number of locks.  The
problem is that <tt>fput()</tt> can also be called from any number of
contexts; there are a few hundred <tt>fput()</tt> and <tt>fput_light()</tt>
calls in the kernel.  Each of those call sites has its own locking
environment and, usually, no knowledge of what code in other subsystems
may be called from <tt>fput()</tt>.  So the potential for problems like
locking-order violations is real.
<p>
The IMA developers ran into exactly that sort of problem.  The IMA
appraisal cleanup code is one of those functions that can be invoked from
an arbitrary <tt>fput()</tt> call.  That code, it seems, sometimes needs to
acquire the associated inode's <tt>i_mutex</tt> lock.  But the locking
rules say that, if both <tt>i_mutex</tt> and the task's <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
are to be acquired, <tt>i_mutex</tt> must be taken first.  If somebody
calls <tt>fput()</tt> with <tt>mmap_sem</tt> held—something that happens in
current kernels—the ordering rule will be violated, possibly deadlocking
the system.  A deadlocked system is arguably secure, but IMA users might be
forgiven for complaining about this situation anyway.
<p>
To get around this problem, IMA tried to check for the possibility of
deadlock inside <tt>fput()</tt>, and, in that case, defer the underlying
<tt>__fput()</tt> call (which does the real work) to a later and safer
context.  This idea <a href="/Articles/494173/">did not impress VFS
maintainer Al Viro</a>, who pointed out that there is no way to encode all
of the kernel's locking rules into <tt>fput()</tt>.  In such situations, it
can be common for core kernel developers to say "NAK" and get back to what
they were doing before, but Al continued to ponder the problem, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If it had been IMA alone, I would've cheerfully told them where to
	stuff the whole thing.  Unfortunately, fput() *is* lock-heavy even
	without them.
</div>
<p>
After thinking for a bit, he came up with <a href="/Articles/494175/">a
plan</a> that offered a way out.  Like the scheme used by IMA, Al's idea
involves turning risky <tt>fput()</tt> calls into an asynchronous operation
running in a separate thread.  But there is no knowledge of locking rules
added to <tt>fput()</tt>; instead, the situation is avoided altogether
whenever possible, and all remaining calls are done asynchronously.
<p>
In particular, Al is looking at all callers of <tt>fget()</tt> and
<tt>fput()</tt> to see if they can be replaced with <tt>fget_light()</tt>
and <tt>fput_light()</tt> instead.  The "light" versions have a number of
additional requirements: they come close to requiring that the calling code
run in atomic context while the reference to the <tt>file</tt> structure is
held.  For a lot of situations - many system calls, for example - these
rules don't get in the way.  As the name suggests, the "light" versions are
less expensive, so switching to them whenever possible makes sense
regardless of any other issues.
<p>
Then, <tt>fput()</tt> in its current form is renamed to
<tt>fput_nodefer()</tt>.  A new <tt>fput()</tt> is added that, when
the final reference to a file is released, queues the real work to be done
asynchronously later on.  The "no defer" version will obviously be
faster—the deferral mechanism will have a cost of its own—so its use will
be preferred whenever possible.  In this case, "whenever possible" means
whenever the caller does not hold any locks.  That is a constraint that can
be independently verified for each call site; the "no defer" name should
also hopefully serve as a warning for any developer who might change the
locking environment in the future.
<p>
With luck, all of the performance-critical calls can be moved to the "no
defer" version, minimizing the performance hit that comes from the deferral
of the <tt>fput()</tt> call.  So it seems like a workable solution—except
for <a href="/Articles/494181/">one little problem</a> pointed out by
Linus: deferral can change the behavior seen by user space.  In particular,
the actual work of closing a file may not be complete by the time control
returns to user space, causing the process's environment to differ in
subtle and timing-dependent ways.  Any program
that expects that the cleanup work will be fully done by the time a
<tt>close()</tt> call returns might just break.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The "totally asynchronous deferral" literally *breaks*semantics*.
<p>
	Sure, it won't be noticeable in 99.99% of all cases, and I doubt
	you can trigger much of a test for it. But it's potential real
	breakage, and it's going to be hard to ever see. And then when it
	*does* happen, it's going to be totally impossible to debug.
</div>
<P>
That does not seem like a good outcome either.  The good news is that there
is a potential solution out there in the form of Oleg Nesterov's <a
href="/Articles/493429/"><tt>task_work_add()</tt></a> patch set.  This
patch adds a functionality similar to workqueues, but with a fundamental
difference: the work is run in the context of the process that was active
at the time the work is added.
<p>
In brief, the interface defines work to be done this way:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/task_work.h&gt;

    typedef void (*task_work_func_t)(struct task_work *);

    struct task_work {
	struct hlist_node hlist;
	task_work_func_t func;
	void *data;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>task_work</tt> structure can be initialized with:
<p>
<pre>
    void init_task_work(struct task_work *twork, task_work_func_t func, 
		        void *data);
</pre>
<p>
The work can be queued for execution with:
<p>
<pre>
    int task_work_add(struct task_struct *task, struct task_work *twork, 
		      bool notify);
</pre>

<p>
A key aspect of this interface is that it will run any queued work before
returning to user space from the kernel.  So that work is guaranteed to be
done before user space can run again; in the case of a function like
<tt>close()</tt>, that guarantee means that user space will see the same
semantics it did before, without subtle timing issues.  So, Linus
suggested, this API may be just what is needed to make the new
<tt>fput()</tt> scheme work.
<p>
There is just one final little problem: about a half-dozen architectures
lack the proper infrastructure to support <tt>task_work_add()</tt>
properly.  That makes it unsuitable for use in the core VFS layer.  Unless,
of course, you're Al Viro; in that case it's just a matter of <a
href="/Articles/494187/">quickly reviewing all the architectures</a> and
coming up with a proposed fix—perhaps in assembly language—for each one.
Assuming Al's work passes muster with the architecture maintainers, all of
this work is likely to be merged for 3.5 - and the IMA appraisal work
should be able to go in with it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

task_work_add also seems like a great way for the kernel to get work done on behalf of a given process, charging the work to that process and letting it get scheduled with the priority of that process.<br>

It does, except that it doesn't wreak havoc on synchronization primitives (APCs can be queued on processes that are waiting on a semaphore or event; if that happens, and a concurrent wakeup happens, something else will be woken up with potential for starvation or even deadlocks).

This is a general problem with finalisers, whether they're triggered by reference counting or 'real' garbage collection. Pretty much any reference-counted resource that requires non-trivial cleanup when the last reference is dropped should use deferred finalisation by default.<br>

<h1>Uninitialized blocks and unexpected flags</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 28, 2012</br>
           </div>
One often-heard complaint in the early BitKeeper era was that, by letting code
reach the mainline without going via a mailing list, BitKeeper made it easy for
maintainers to slip surprise changes in underneath the review radar.  Those
worries have mostly proved unfounded; when surprises have happened, the
response from the community has usually helped to ensure that there would
be no repeats.  But some developers are charging that the 3.7 kernel
contains exactly this type of stealth change and are demanding that it be
reverted. 
<p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
The <tt>fallocate()</tt> system call is meant to be a way for an
application to request the efficient allocation of blocks for a file.  Use
of <tt>fallocate()</tt> allows a process to verify that the required disk
space is available, helps the filesystem to allocate all of the space
in a single, contiguous group, and avoids the overhead that block-by-block
allocation 
would incur.  In the absence of an <tt>fallocate()</tt> implementation
(each filesystem must implement it independently), the
C library will emulate it by
simply writing zeroes to the requested block range; that gets the space
allocated, but is less efficient than one would like.  The implementation
of <tt>fallocate()</tt> within filesystems tries to be more efficient than
that; one way to do so is to avoid the process of writing zeroes to the
newly-allocated blocks. 
<p>
Leaving stale data in allocated blocks has obvious security implications: a
hostile application could read those blocks in the hopes of finding
confidential documents, passwords, or the missing Fedora&nbsp;18 Beta release
announcement.  To avoid this exposure, filesystems like ext4 will mark
unwritten blocks as being uninitialized; any attempt to read those blocks
will be intercepted and just return zeroes.  In the normal case, the
application will write data to those blocks before ever trying to read
them; writing obviously initializes the blocks without the need to write
zeroes first.  This implementation seems like it should be about optimal. 
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
Except that, seemingly, ext4 marks uninitialized blocks at the extent
(group of contiguous blocks) level.  So, if an application writes to one
uninitialized block, the containing extent must be split and the
newly-written block(s) added to the previous extent, if possible.  That
turns out to be more expensive than some users would like.  So a shortcut
was attempted. 
<p>
That shortcut first appeared in April, 2012, in the form of <a
href="/Articles/492959/">a new <tt>fallocate()</tt> flag</a> called
<tt>FALLOC_FL_NO_HIDE_STALE</tt>.  If <tt>fallocate()</tt> was called with
that flag, the newly-allocated blocks would be marked as being initialized
even though the old data remained untouched.  That obviously brings the old
security 
issues back; to mitigate the problem, the patch added a mount option making
the new 
functionality available only to members of a specific group.  That was
deemed to be enough, especially for settings where access to the machine as
a whole is tightly controlled. 
<p>
At least, the authors and supporters of the patch deemed the group check to
be enough.  The patch was roundly criticized by other filesystem
developers; the prevailing opinion appeared to be that it was trying to
open up a huge security hole in order to avoid fixing an ext4 performance
problem.  After that discussion, the patch went away and wasn't heard from
again. 
<p>
<h4>A surprise flag</h4>
<p>
At least, it was not heard from until recently, when some filesystem
developers were surprised to discover <a 
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/bbdd68086ca4a8976226e23efd08e2058d34dd81">this
commit</a> by Ted Ts'o which found its way into the mainline (via the ext4 tree)
during the 3.7 merge window.  The patch is small and simple; it simply
defines the <tt>FALLOC_FL_NO_HIDE_STALE</tt> flag, but adds no code to
actually implement it.  The changelog reads:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
As discussed at the Plumber's Conference, reserve the bit 0x04 in
fallocate() to prevent collisions with a commonly used out-of-tree
patch which implements the no-hide-stale feature. 
</div>
<p>
Filesystem developer Dave Chinner, at least, does not recall this
discussion.  His response was to post <a href="/Articles/527390/">a patch
reverting the change</a>, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
The lack of formal review and discussion for a syscall API change
is grounds for reverting patch, especially given the controversial
nature of the feature and the previous discussions and NAKs. The
way the change was pushed into mainline borders on an abuse of the
trust we place in maintainers and hence as a matter of principle
this change should be reverted. 
</div>

<p> 
It is true that this particular change is a bit abnormal.  It changes
the core filesystem code but came by way of a filesystem-specific tree with
no acks from any other developers.  The patch does not appear to have been
posted to any relevant mailing list, violating the rule that all patches
should go through public review before being pushed toward the mainline.
The addition of a flag with no in-kernel users is also contrary to usual
kernel practice.  It is, in summary, the sort of change that less
well-established kernel developers would never get away with making.  So it
is hard to fault other filesystem developers for being surprised and
unhappy.

<p>
On the other hand, the change just adds a flag definition; it obviously
cannot cause problems for existing code.  And there does appear to be a
real user community for this feature.  Ted <a
href="/Articles/527392/">justified</a> his action this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
It doesn't change the interface or break anything; it just reserves
a bit so that out-of-tree patches don't collide with future
allocations.  There are significant usages of this bit within
Google and Tao Bao.  It is true that there has been significant
pushback about adding this functionality on linux-fsdevel; I find
it personally frustrating that in effect, if enough people scream,
they can veto an optional feature that might only be implemented by
a single file system. 
</div>
<p>
This explanation does not appear to have satisfied anybody, though.  So we
have an impasse of sorts; some developers want a flag to control a
functionality they need, while others see it as a security problem and the
result of an abuse of the kernel's trust system. 
<p>
Alan Cox <a href="/Articles/527394/">suggested</a> that it would be
possible to, instead, reserve a set of filesystem-private flags that could
be used for any purpose by any filesystem.  Dave <a
href="/Articles/527395/">pointed out</a>, however, that a flag
bit that behaved differently from one filesystem to the next is a recipe
for trouble.  His suggestion, instead, is that this functionality should be
implemented via the <tt>ioctl()</tt> interface, which is where
filesystem-specific options usually hide.   The <tt>ioctl()</tt> approach
seems like it should be workable, but no patches to that effect have been
posted thus far. 
<p>
As of this writing, Linus has not accepted the revert, so the
<tt>FALLOC_FL_NO_HIDE_STALE</tt> flag can still be found in the 3.7
kernel.  He has also remained silent in the discussion.  He will have to
make a decision one way or the other, though, before the final 3.7 release
is made.  Once that flag is made available in a stable mainline release, it
will be much harder to get rid of, so, if that flag is going to come out,
it needs to happen soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

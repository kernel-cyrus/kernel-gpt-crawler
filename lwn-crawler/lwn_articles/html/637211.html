<p>
On day two of the 2015 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management
Summit, Chuck Lever led a discussion on NFS performance.  There are some
bottlenecks to look at, and suggestions were made on ways to avoid
some of them. 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>transport_lock</tt> is a spinlock used by the Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) layer.  It is a bit like the Big Kernel Lock (BKL), Lever said, in
that it protects all of the transport data on a per-socket basis.
It is used as a queueing mechanism to prevent RPCs from interleaving on the
wire.  He is looking for ways to break up that lock, much as the
BKL-removal work did with the BKL.

</a>

<p>
Currently, a thread is woken up to copy the received data, but it might
make more 
sense to do that work in software interrupt (softirq) context, Jeff Layton
said.  That is how 
remote DMA (RDMA) does things, Lever said.  Layton said you could start by
simply doing copies out of the socket buffer from the softirq, but
eventually using 
<tt>splice()</tt> might provide even better performance.
</p>

<p>
Lever said that there is also a proposal to make incoming data be
page-aligned.  Andreas Gruenbacher said that the idea was to use large network
frames and to receive them into page-aligned buffers.

<p>
Dave Chinner said
that will require the sending side to be aware of that setting so that it
can form 
its TCP packets in large frames.  Bruce Fields said that the networking
developers 
didn't like the change. Chinner said that he was not surprised, as
messing with segment boundaries is always tricky.
Gruenbacher noted that it required using the new huge frames to get enough
data into one packet, as doing page-aligned receives on small packets will
just waste space.
</p>

<p>
One of the two data copies that are currently being done could be saved if
the softirq code changed to look inside the RPC packets, Fields said.  By
figuring out 
what the packet contains, the RPC code could route it to the right place,
sometimes 
using <tt>splice()</tt>.  Lever said that RDMA solves the copying problem
nicely, but that it is a niche use case and likely to remain that way.
</p>

<p>
Another area of performance improvement is to use NFS compounds, which
allow multiple read and write operations in a single NFS transaction.
Lever said that Fields has been working on support for that as part of the
NFS 4.2 support in Linux.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Lever said, there is a new operation in 4.2 called
<tt>READ_PLUS</tt> that will assist when clients are reading sparse files.
That operation allows the server to report the holes optimally.  There was
concern that rematerializing the holes on the client might be expensive,
but that turned out not to be the case.
</p>

<p>
Fields said that he used <tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> and <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt> flags to
<tt>lseek()</tt> to add the holes to the files on the client side.  But
Chinner cautioned that there is no way of atomically finding holes and
returning data beyond them, as it will always race with other operations
that are happening on the file.

<p>
Lever said that <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-4555/rfsrefer-140/index.html">NFS
delegations</a>, which are a kind of file lock, would be required from the
server when the <tt>READ_PLUS</tt> operation is used.  That will only be
granted by the server if no one has the file open for writing.  However,
delegation is not enabled on all NFS servers.
And that is where the conversation kind of trailed off.

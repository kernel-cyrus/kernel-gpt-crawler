           </div>
<p>A typical computer system has numerous &quot;buses&quot; to carry data
and control from the CPU out to various peripheral devices and back.  Linux
generally supports these buses by having &quot;master&quot; drivers to
manage the hardware at the CPU end of the bus, and &quot;slave&quot;
drivers to manage the peripheral.  There is one particular bus for which
there are no slave drivers, at least not in the normal sense, but for which
there is recurring interest in supporting the creation of such drivers.  The
asynchronous character-oriented serial bus, one of the oldest bus types
that is still in wide use today, is managed quite differently from other
buses, but might soon be enhanced to better meet current needs.</p>

<p>One difficulty I have in discussing this bus is that there does not seem
to be a suitably generic name.  Once upon a time I would have called it a
&quot;serial connection&quot;, but today most connections are serial,
whether SATA, SAS (serial attached SCSI), Ethernet, or I2C.  So that
name doesn't work.  RS-232 was once a popular name, but that specifies
higher voltage levels and more wires than are normally found on the
intra-board connections that we will be interested in.  The name UART,
standing for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, is at about the
right level of generality, but really refers to the controlling hardware
rather than the bus itself.  TTY, an abbreviation for "teletype", is the name
I will largely use, not because there are any teletypewriters connected to
any computers I have used in a long time, but because it is a name that is
widely used in Unix and Linux history and in present implementations, and
it is nice and short.</p>

<p>When a computer system has some TTY ports, Linux will discover these
ports and create devices like <tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> to allow them to be
managed.  In general, Linux knows nothing about what might be connected to
the port.  One exception is that a &quot;console&quot; might be known to be
attached to one of the ports, and Linux will then send kernel messages to
that port.  In other cases, Linux needs to be explicitly told what is
attached if it is expected to handle it in any particular way.</p>

<h4>Line disciplines</h4>

<p>Linux doesn't always <em>need</em> to know what is attached to a TTY
port â€” a program in user space can open the <tt>/dev/ttyXX</tt> device and
read or write as appropriate.  Sometimes, though, it can be helpful for the
kernel to take a larger role; for those times there are <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/tty.h?id=c6935931c1894ff857616ff8549b61236a19148f">&quot;line
disciplines&quot;</a>, which is really just another name for &quot;protocol
handlers&quot;.  As an example: dial-up networking uses a modem to connect
a TTY port on 
one machine to a similar port on another machine.  Once a connection is
established over the modem, the PPP protocol is often used to allow
Internet traffic to flow between the computers.  As this requires tight
integration with the networking subsystem in the kernel, it is easiest if
the PPP protocol itself is handled directly by Linux.  To this end, there is
an <tt>N_PPP</tt> line discipline.  Once the connection is established,
<tt>pppd</tt> (the user-space daemon for managing the connection) sets the
line discipline to <tt>N_PPP</tt> and all further traffic is handled directly
by the kernel.</p>

<p>Another line discipline that was once more widely used than it is now is
the <tt>N_MOUSE</tt> protocol for communicating with serial-attached mice.
<tt>N_MOUSE</tt> passes data from the TTY port though to the
&quot;input&quot; subsystem so it appears on <tt>/dev/input/mouse0</tt> or
similar and can be easily used by your windowing system.  There are a
collection of other line disciplines for various different serial protocols.
Each one needs to be explicitly activated by a program like <tt>pppd</tt>
for <tt>N_PPP</tt>, <tt>inputattach</tt> for <tt>N_MOUSE</tt>, and
<tt>hciattach</tt> for <tt>N_HCI</tt> (the protocol for communicating with
Bluetooth transceivers).  The line discipline only remains active for as long
as that program keeps the TTY device open.</p>

<p>If line disciplines were being invented today, they would almost
certainly be drivers on a bus that would get bound to the hardware either
automatically, or by writing to a <tt>bind</tt> file in <tt>sysfs</tt>.</p>

<h4>Problematic use cases</h4>

<p>Though the mechanism for attaching a line discipline to a TTY port
allows a lot of serial-attached devices to be used quite effectively, there
are two areas where the current solution is not entirely satisfactory
thus motivating various people to seek improvements.  These areas
involve transparent discovery and sideband controls such as power
management.</p>

<p>If I have a computer system, such as a mobile device, which has, for
example, a Bluetooth transceiver permanently attached to a UART, then I
shouldn't have to tell the software running on that device about the
hardware arrangement.  The firmware on the device should <em>know</em>
about the Bluetooth device, possibly from nodes in a device-tree description
of the hardware, or possibly from information in the ACPI tables, and
something should read that description and configure the TTY port
appropriately.  It might be possible for a user-space program to extract
the information and run <tt>hciattach</tt>, but as firmware tables are
normally interpreted by the kernel, and as <tt>hciattach</tt> does little
more than request the <tt>N_HCI</tt> line discipline, it seems sensible to
have the kernel set everything up transparently.  The &quot;little
more&quot; that <tt>hciattach</tt> does might involve setting a bit rate,
performing some initialization, or uploading firmware.  All of these are
the sorts of things the kernel already does, so it would be no extra
burden.</p>

<p>Even in cases where the device can be managed without a dedicated line
discipline, there might be a need to do more than just send and receive
bytes.  Power management is important in all computer systems these days
and, while some serial-attached devices can power themselves up or down in
response to commands over the serial connection, this capability is not universal.
Were we using RS-232, the DTR (data terminal ready) line would probably be
used to manage power, but many UARTs do not have a DTR line, and asserting
a signal is not necessarily the best way to control power for an
integrated device.  Device power management in Linux is generally handled
by the device driver for the particular device, since it knows the needs and is
able to assert a GPIO output, activate a regulator, or whatever else is
needed.  But, with TTY ports, there is no slave device driver to perform
these tasks.</p>

<p>Both of these difficulties could be solved if a TTY were treated more
like a bus that could have slave devices attached as children.  The
configuring of child devices is the normal way that device information from
device tree or ACPI tables is handled, and these devices would be well placed to
select a non-default line discipline or to control the power management of
the device when it is opened or activated.</p>

<h4>Where to put the device</h4>

<p>Though I was not involved in the most recent discussions on this topic,
I have attempted to make progress in this problem space in the past; a
recurring problem is that it wasn't obvious, to me at least, what shape the
solution should take.  Above, I have described the need as being for a &quot;TTY
bus&quot; with &quot;slave devices&quot; but that understanding only came
about after several failures, and there is not yet a certainty that it is
best solution.</p>

<p>Linux has a concept of a <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/driver-model/platform.txt">&quot;platform
bus&quot;</a>, which is a &quot;pseudo-bus&quot; that is described more by
examples than by a concrete purpose.  It is contrasted with &quot;large
formally specified [buses] like PCI or USB.&quot; A driver to control a
GPIO line to manage the power of a GPS device attached to a TTY could
easily be seen as part of the &quot;platform&quot; rather than part of a
genuine bus, particularly if you didn't think of a TTY as a
&quot;bus&quot;, which I certainly didn't.  So an <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/625953/">early attempt</a> created a
platform device to handle power management and taught the TTY driver to
tell the attached platform device when it was opened or closed.  This
didn't address the auto-detection need, which did not concern me at the
time.  The patch was <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160814113513.GB21529%40kroah.com">vetoed
by Greg Kroah-Hartman</a>, both when I proposed it and when it was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/697175/">recently re-proposed</a> by
Sebastian Reichel, who is trying to make the Bluetooth transceiver on the
Nokia N950 work correctly.  As Kroah-Hartman put it: "<q>I've said
before that a &quot;serial&quot; bus should be created</q>".</p>

<p>Rob Herring <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/697534/">responded to this
challenge</a> and proposed a &quot;UART slave device bus&quot; that is not
entirely unlike <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/643878/">something I
proposed last year</a>.  Linux contains a &quot;serial core&quot; subsystem
that supports a wide range of serial character devices and which provides a
<tt>uart_port</tt> abstraction.  This is separate from the &quot;tty&quot;
subsystem, which provides a <tt>tty_port</tt>, handles all the peculiarities
of Posix TTY devices, and manages the line disciplines.  As all the devices
that anyone wanted to create a slave device for were UARTs, it seemed
natural to both Herring and myself to make changes at the
<tt>uart_port</tt> level.</p>

<p>Alan Cox <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160818152528.569eb426%40lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk">vetoed
this one</a>.  In his view, the UART isn't the right place to
attach slaves because not all serial devices use the UART code, or not in
the same way.  In particular, USB-attached serial ports do not use the UART
code at all.  Cox
recalled that: "<q>As I told you over six months ago uart_port
is not the correct abstraction. You need to be working at the tty_port
layer,</q>" and <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160819123808.05b9dc3c%40lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk">again</a>:
"<q>This again is why it needs to be at the tty_port
layer.</q>" The <tt>tty_port</tt> interface, provided by the TTY
layer, is clearly the more general interface for serial devices .... or is
it?</p>

<h4>The serio bus</h4>

<p>There are some serial character devices that don't use UARTs and don't
even interface with the TTY layer.  The most common example is the PS/2
mouse.  The over-the-wire protocol used by a PS/2 mouse is similar to that
used by serial-port mice, but is more constrained and so can be supported
with simpler hardware than a UART.  In Linux, the driver for PS/2 mouse
hardware (and PS/2 keyboards as well) is attached to the <tt>serio</tt>
(serial I/O) bus, which feeds into the <tt>input</tt> subsystem.</p>

<p>The <tt>N_MOUSE</tt> TTY line discipline mentioned earlier is really a
generic gateway from TTY devices into the <tt>serio</tt> bus.  It was
designed for use with serial mice, but could be used with any device with a
similar character-based interface.  Herring, <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=12886761.WF058qtZp8%40wuerfel">with
a little prompting from Arnd Bergmann</a>, wondered if the <tt>serio</tt>
bus could become the place to attach the slave devices that we seem to
want.  To this end, he <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160824232437.9446-1-robh%40kernel.org">prepared
some patches</a> that allow device tree configuration to direct a serio
device to attach to the HCI interface for the Bluetooth subsystem.  With
these patches it is still necessary to run <tt>inputattach</tt> to gateway
the TTY to the serio bus using the <tt>N_MOUSE</tt> line discipline.
Herring claims: "<q>Once a tty_port based serio port driver is
in place, this step will not be needed</q>".  In some ways, this
seems like an step in the right direction, in others it seems like it might
just be moving the problem to a new location.</p>

<p>While this serio approach could work well for auto-configuration of
Bluetooth devices, it isn't obvious that it works well for power management
of GPS receivers using sideband signaling.  For a GPS receiver we really
still need the TTY device, <tt>/dev/ttyXX</tt>, to exist much as it does
now.  We don't want to attach an alternate line discipline, because the
kernel doesn't understand the protocols
(such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183">NMEA</a> and various
binary protocols)
that GPS devices use. The current solution of running
<a href="http://catb.org/gpsd/"><tt>gpsd</tt></a> to interpret these
protocols is quite effective.  Though Marcel Holtmann <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=28DDAF2B-2341-403B-80D8-DA0A63F51FF1%40holtmann.org">attested</a>
that he is "<q>not convinced that GPS should be represented as
/dev/ttyS0 or similar TTY</q>" and Kroah-Hartman <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160818105521.GB7031%40kroah.com">expressed
support for this position</a>, the creation of a GPS device type seems to
be a separate need than allowing a device to be powered on when a TTY is
opened, and powered off when it is closed.</p>

<h4>Ideas for forward progress</h4>

<p>Though this recent conversation does not seem to have produced any code
that is likely to get merged, it did bring up a lot of ideas and a lot of
constructive criticism for why some of the proposals were not satisfactory.
One of the most discouraging responses one can get when submitting a patch
is to have it rejected with no clear explanation of why it was rejected.
That didn't happen here.  Of all the feedback that was provided, possibly
the most concretely useful was Cox's insistence that <tt>tty_port</tt>
should be the basis of a new bus ("<q>The basic problem is that the
bus should be tty_ports not uart, fix that and the rest starts to make
sense.</q>") and his explanation of the role of the
<tt>tty_port</tt> as the item in the device model which "<q>has the
lifetime of the hardware</q>".</p>

<p>When serial hardware is discovered, whether it is a UART, a USB-attached
serial port, or something else, a <tt>tty_port</tt> is created.  It is currently
registered as a character device so that an entry appears in <tt>/dev</tt>,
which can then be opened.  When it is opened, a <tt>tty_struct</tt> is attached,
and line disciplines can be attached to that.  The right approach seems to
be to insert a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/645810/">bus
abstraction</a> under the <tt>tty_port</tt> so that different drivers can
be bound to the port.  The default driver would register a character device
that would attach a <tt>tty_struct</tt> when it was opened.  Other drivers
might connect through to the Bluetooth subsystem, or might interpose some
power management controls and then register a TTY character device.</p>

<p>One reason this hasn't been done already is that the TTY layer is a
little complicated.  <tt>tty_port</tt> and <tt>tty_struct</tt> are closely
intertwined and separating them, as seems to be required, is not a task for
the timid.  Cox has <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&amp;q=20160822183849.6dfdb9d2%40lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk">posted
an RFC patch</a> that takes a step in this direction by allowing a
<tt>tty_port</tt> to be used without an open file handle.  There is a lot
more that would need to be done, but this is a valuable start, particularly
as it comes from someone with a deep knowledge of the TTY
layer who can probably see the end game more clearly than the rest of us.

<p>The conversation has died down for the moment.  That might mean that
people have been distracted by more urgent issues, or it could mean that
now is a time for coding rather than discussion.  This is a topic that has
arisen several times in the past and while it is generally met with
enthusiastic in-principle agreement, it does not seem have been quite
important enough to anyone to push through the various barriers to find a
solution that is broadly acceptable.  Maybe this time will be
different.</p>

<p>In a conversation on the Kernel Summit email list concerning the
different sorts of &quot;stable&quot; kernels that vendors use and how much
is being backported to them, Tim Bird <a
href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-September/003802.html">lamented</a>
that "<q>there are still significant areas where the mainline
kernel just doesn't have the support needed for shipping
product</span>.&quot; The appropriate emphasis, in the mainline kernel
community, to require well designed and fully general solutions inevitably
means that some functionality takes a while to land.  This means that
vendors with tight deadlines need to choose between staying close to
mainline or having all the functionality they want.  It is understandable
that they will often choose the latter.  Finding ways to minimize the need
for this choice is one of the ongoing challenges for the kernel community
and one that we might see playing out, in a small way, with the need for TTY
slave devices.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The only problem I have with using "TTY" is that it mixes Greek (tel- meaning at a distance) and Latin (type- meaning symbol or image).  The Latin is derived from Greek though (typos- meaning dent, impression).  Otherwise, TTY is perfect for describing its functionality (the 1904 trademark notwithstanding).<br>

When reading those threads on LKML, I had wondered why a kernel thread couldn't be responsible for examining the device tree / ACPI, opening the port, attaching the line discipline and handling PM?<br>

I think that would only be half a solution, but it isn't clear what you mean exactly by "handling PM".<br>
<p>
How would this thread detect when some process opened /dev/ttyS3 so it could power-on the widget attached to that serial port?<br>

I was under the impression that in such a case, userspace wouldn't need to open /dev/ttyS3 at all - it would be opening the bluetooth device or whatever that was associated with the line discipline.<br>
<p>
The kernel thread has a file descriptor open to the port, so the line discipline should be able to use that to inform the thread when userspace has the device open (but yes, I admit there was much handwaving accompanying "handle PM" :)<br>

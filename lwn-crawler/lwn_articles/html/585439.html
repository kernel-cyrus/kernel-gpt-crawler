<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 12, 2014</br>
           </div>
The kernel's power management code works to keep the hardware in the most
power-efficient state that is consistent with the current demands
on the system.  Sometimes, though, overly aggressive power management can
interfere with the proper functioning of the system; putting the CPU into a
sleep state might wreck ongoing DMA operations, for example.  To avoid
situations like that, the <a href="/Articles/386139/">pm_qos</a> (power
management quality of service) mechanism was added to the kernel; using
pm_qos, device drivers can describe their requirements to the
power-management subsystem.  More recently, we have seen a bit of a change
in focus in pm_qos, though, as it evolves to handle power management within
peripheral devices as well.
<p>
A partial step in that direction was taken in the 3.2 development cycle,
when per-device constraints were added.  Like the original pm_qos
subsystem, this mechanism is  a way
for devices to specify their own quality-of-service needs; it allows a
driver to specify a maximum value for how long a powered-down device can
wait to get power back when it needs to do something.  This value (called
<tt>DEV_PM_QOS_LATENCY</tt> in current kernels) is meant to be used with
the <a href="/Articles/449585/">power domains</a> feature to determine
whether (and how deeply) a particular domain on a system-on-chip could be
powered down.
<p>
The quest for lower power consumption continues, though, and, as a result,
we are seeing more devices that perform their own internal power management
based on the access patterns they observe.  Memory controllers might put
some banks into lower power states if they are not seeing much use, for
example; this 
technology seems to work well enough to take much of the wind out of the
sails of the various <a href="/Articles/568891/">memory power
management</a> patch sets out there.  Disk drives can spin themselves down,
camera sensors can turn themselves off, and so on.  Peripherals do not have
as good an idea of future access patterns as the host computer should, but,
it turns out, they can often do a good job of guessing based on the recent
past.
<p>
That said, there will certainly be times when a device will decide to take
a nap at an inopportune moment.  To help avoid this kind of embarrassing
situation, many devices that have internal power management provide a way
for the host system to communicate its latency needs to the device.  If
such a device has 
been informed by the CPU that it should respond with a latency no greater
than, say, 10ms, it will not go into any sleep states that would take
longer to come back out of.
<p>
Current kernels have no formalized way to control the latency requirements
communicated to devices, though.  That situation could change as early as
the 3.15 development cycle, though, if Rafael Wysocki's <a
href="/Articles/584541/">latency tolerance device pm_qos type patch set</a>
finds its way into the mainline.  This work uses much of the existing
pm_qos framework, but to a different end: rather than allowing drivers to
communicate their requirements to the power management core, this mechanism
carries latency requirements back to drivers.
<p>
The first step is to rename <tt>DEV_PM_QOS_LATENCY</tt>, which, it could be
argued, has an ambiguous name in the new way of doing things.  The new name
(<tt>DEV_PM_QOS_RESUME_LATENCY</tt>) may not be that much clearer to
developers reading the code from the outside, but it does make room for the
new <tt>DEV_PM_QOS_LATENCY_TOLERANCE</tt> value.  As noted above, this
pm_qos type differs from the others in that it communicates a tolerance
<i>to</i> a device; it also differs in that it is exposed to user space.
Any device that supports this feature will have a new attribute
(<tt>pm_qos_latency_tolerance_us</tt>) in its sysfs <tt>power</tt>
directory.  A specific latency value (in Âµs) can be written to this
attribute to indicate that the device must be able to respond in the given
period of time.  There are two special values as well: "<tt>auto</tt>", which
puts the device into its fully automatic power-management mode, and
"<tt>any</tt>", which does not set any specific constraints, but which
tells the hardware not to adjust its latency tolerance values in response
to other power-management events (transitions to and from a suspended
state, for example).
<p>
Device power management information is stored in <tt>struct
dev_pm_info</tt> which, in turn, is found in <tt>struct&nbsp;device</tt>.
Devices supporting <tt>DEV_PM_QOS_LATENCY_TOLERANCE</tt> need to provide a
new function in that structure:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*set_latency_tolerance)(struct device *dev, s32 tolerance);
</pre>
<p>
Whenever the latency tolerance value changes,
<tt>set_latency_tolerance()</tt> will be called with the new value.  The
special <tt>tolerance</tt> value <tt>PM_QOS_LATENCY_ANY</tt> corresponds to
the "<tt>any</tt>" value described above.  Otherwise, a negative
<tt>tolerance</tt> 
value indicates that the device should be put into the fully automatic
mode.
<p>
In many cases, driver authors will not need to concern themselves with
providing this callback, though.  Instead, it will be handled at the bus
level, perhaps in combination with the firmware.  The initial
implementation posted by Rafael takes advantage of the "latency tolerance
reporting" registers provided via ACPI by some Intel devices; for such
devices, the power management implementation exists in the ACPI code and
need not be duplicated elsewhere.
<p>
The final step is to actually make use of this feature when hardware that
supports it is available.  Such use seems most likely to show up in mobile
systems and other dedicated settings where the software can easily be
taught to tweak the latency parameters when the need arises.  Writing
applications that can tune those parameters on a general-purpose system
seems like a harder task.  But, even there, when the hardware wants to do
the wrong thing, there will be a mechanism to set it straight.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

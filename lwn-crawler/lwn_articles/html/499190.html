<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 30, 2012</br>
           </div>
Uprobes is a kernel patch with a long story and many contentious
discussions behind it.  This code has its roots in utrace, a user-space
tracing and debugging API that was first <a
href="/Articles/224772/">covered here</a> in early 2007.  Utrace ran into
various types of opposition (only partly related to its own origin in
SystemTap) and has never been merged, but a piece of it 
lives on in the form of uprobes, which is charged with the placement of
probes into user-space code.  After several mailing-list rounds of its own,
uprobes was finally merged for the 3.5 kernel development cycle.  Just how
this facility will be used remains to be seen, however.
<p>
At the core of uprobes is this function:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/uprobes.h&gt;

    int uprobe_register(struct inode *inode, loff_t offset, struct uprobe_consumer *uc);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>inode</tt> structure represents an executable file; the probe is to
be placed at <tt>offset</tt> bytes from the beginning.  The
<tt>uprobe_consumer</tt> structure tells the kernel what is to be done when
a process encounters the probe; it looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct uprobe_consumer {
	int (*handler) (struct uprobe_consumer *self, struct pt_regs *regs);
	bool (*filter) (struct uprobe_consumer *self, struct task_struct *task);
	struct uprobe_consumer *next;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>filter()</tt> function is optional; if it exists, it determines
whether <tt>handler()</tt> is called for each specific hit on the probe.
The handler returns an <tt>int</tt>, but the return value is ignored in the
current code.
<p>
Since probes are associated with files, they affect all processes that run
code from those files.  A special copy is made of the page to contain the
probe; in that copy, the instruction at the specified offset is copied and
replaced by a breakpoint.  When the breakpoint is hit by a running process,
<tt>filter()</tt> will be called if present, and <tt>handler()</tt> will be
run unless the filter said otherwise.  Then the displaced instruction is
executed (using the "execute out of line" mechanism described in <a
href="/Articles/370322/">this article</a>) and control returns to the
instruction following the breakpoint.  
<p>
Uprobes thus implements a mechanism by which a kernel function can be
invoked whenever a process executes a specific instruction location.  One
could imagine a number of things that said kernel function could do; there
has been talk, for example, of using uprobes (and, perhaps someday,
something derived from utrace) as a replacement for the much-maligned
<tt>ptrace()</tt> system call.  Tools like GDB could place breakpoints with
uprobes; it might even be possible to load simple filters for conditional
breakpoints into the kernel, speeding their execution considerably.
Uprobes could also someday be a component of a Dtrace-like dynamic tracing
functionality.  For now, though, the interfaces for that kind of feature
have not been added to the kernel; none have even been proposed.
<p>
What the current implementation <i>does</i> have is integration with the
perf events subsystem.  New dynamic "events" can be added to any file
location via an interface similar to that used for <a
href="/Articles/343766/">dynamic kernel tracepoints</a>.  In particular,
there is a new file called <tt>uprobe_events</tt> in the tracing directory
(<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/</tt> on most systems) that is used to add
and remove events.  As an example, a line like:
<p>
<pre>
    echo 'p:bashme /bin/bash:0x4245c0' &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events
</pre>
would place a new event (called "<tt>bashme</tt>") at location 0x4245c0 in
the <tt>bash</tt> executable.  The event would then appear with all other
events in <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events</tt>, in the
<tt>uprobes</tt> subdirectory.  Like other events, it is not actually
turned on until its <tt>enabled</tt> attribute is set.  See <a
href="/Articles/499286/">Documentation/trace/uprobetracer.txt</a> for
details on the interface at this level.
<p>
Placing uprobes is, by default, a privileged operation requiring the
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability.  One can remove the privilege
requirement by setting the <tt>perf_paranoid</tt> sysctl knob to
<tt>-1</tt>, but doing so will allow the placement of dynamic tracepoints
anywhere in the system, in kernel or user space.  Thus, one need not be
overly paranoid to leave <tt>perf_paranoid</tt> at its default setting.
<p>
The <tt>perf</tt> tool has been enhanced to make working with dynamic user-space
tracepoints easy.  One can, for example, set a tracepoint at the entry to
the C library's <tt>malloc()</tt> implementation with:
<p>
<pre>
    perf probe -x /lib64/libc.so.6 malloc
</pre>
<p>
That tracepoint can then be treated like any other event understood by
perf.  See <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/654443e20dfc0617231f28a07c96a979ee1a0239">the
explanatory text</a> from Ingo Molnar's pull request for examples of what
can be done.
<p>

Most kernel patches are conceived, implemented, reviewed, and merged into
the mainline over a fairly short period of time.  But some of them seem to
languish for years without making much progress.  Uprobes was such a patch
set.  It must have been frustrating for the developers to keep revising and
posting this code, only to see it shot down over and over again.  But the
kernel community can be supportive of developers who show both persistence
and a willingness to listen to criticism.  The result, in this case, is a
user-space probing mechanism that has been simplified, made more robust,
and integrated into the existing events infrastructure.  Hopefully it was
worth the wait.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hi,<br>
<p>
you might want to try out fulltrace, available at the following address:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/andreoli/fulltrace">https://github.com/andreoli/fulltrace</a><br>
<p>
Fulltrace is a complete program, library and kernel tracer. Given a command, it dynamically finds all functions invoked by it, by any library it uses and by the kernel. It only requires a recent Linux kernel (&gt;=3.5) compiled with ftrace and uprobes support. Note: this is still very experimental (consider it "proof-of-concept" code) and needs a lot of work.<br>
Any suggestion is more than welcome.<br>

"it has been simplified, made more robust, and integrated into the existing events infrastructure"<br>
<p>
While the last of those is definitely true, the first may just be due to equivalent functionality being deferred, and the second is way too early to say.<br>

Isn't using perf_paranoid for this a disastrous choice?<br>
<p>
AFAICT uprobe insertion is equivalent to root, since you can modify bytes in the middle of instructions, and thus alter the behavior of any process.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, currently perf_paranoid only gives access to PMU, which can normally only be use to DoS the system at worst.<br>

Setting a uprobe for a binary does not modify the on-disk binary file directly.<br>
It sets the probe for (inode, offset) in a kernel internal data structure, inode is the inode for the binary file, offset is the instruction offset in the binary file.<br>
Since the binary is memory mapped for execution, when the probed instruction is accessed through mmap, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/events/uprobes.c#L459">https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/eve...</a> will replace the original instruction with "0xcc" (int3).<br>
So if a uprobe is set for binary /tmp/test, then mv /tmp/test /home/test, then run /home/test, the probe still works, because the inode does not change after mv.<br>

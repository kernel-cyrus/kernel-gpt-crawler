<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 27, 2016</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/532593/">user namespaces</a> feature holds an
interesting promise for system security: users can be confined within a
namespace, given full root privileges within that namespace, and still be
unable to adversely affect the system as a whole.  The path to better
security has, perhaps predictably, proved to be a bit rocky, however.  In
response, there is now an effort to make the feature configurable by system
administrators, but this new configuration knob is proving to be a harder
sell than one might expect.
<p>
User namespaces are created by passing the <tt>CLONE_NEWUSER</tt> flag to
the <tt>clone()</tt> or <tt>unshare()</tt> system calls.  Administrators
who are nervous about allowing access to this feature currently only have
one option: configure out support at kernel build time.  That option is not
easily available to the many systems running distribution-built kernels,
though.  Kees Cook set out to create an easier way with <a
href="/Articles/673261/">this patch set</a> creating a new sysctl knob to
control access to the user-namespace feature, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There continues to be unexpected side-effects and security
	exposures via CLONE_NEWUSER. For many end-users running distro
	kernels with CONFIG_USER_NS enabled, there is no way to disable
	this feature when desired. As such, this creates a sysctl to
	restrict CLONE_NEWUSER so admins not running containers or Chrome
	can avoid the risks of this feature.
</div>
<p>
In particular, the patch adds a knob called
<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/userns_restrict</tt>. 
When it is set to the default value (zero), user namespaces are unrestricted.
Setting it to one allows only privileged users to create user namespaces;
a setting of two disables user namespaces altogether.  In that final
case, it is not possible to re-enable user namespaces without rebooting the
system.
<p>
One of the first issues to be aired had to do with naming: it turns out
that Debian currently carries a similar patch, but, on Debian systems, the
knob is called <tt>unprivileged_userns_clone</tt> and doesn't support the
"privileged users only" setting.  Ben Hutchings <a
href="/Articles/673602/">agreed</a> that the new naming was probably
better and said that, should Kees's patch go upstream, Debian would slowly
move over to it.
<p>
Some developers worried that allowing user namespaces to be turned off
would slow the process of finding and fixing any remaining security
issues.  Additionally, Serge Hallyn <a
href="/Articles/673604/">suggested</a> that, if application developers
could not count on the availability of user namespaces, they wouldn't use
them at all.  He suggested that, if the knob is accepted,  it be marked as
a short-term workaround that would eventually be removed.
<p>
The strongest opposition, though, came from Eric Biederman, the creator of
user namespaces and also the developer who has done the most work on the
sysctl code in recent times.  He <a href="/Articles/673610/">stated</a>
flat out that "<q>the code is buggy, and poorly thought through</q>"
and would not be merged.  In <a href="/Articles/673611/">another
message</a> he described his objections in detail, starting with a challenge
to the idea that user namespaces are a security risk at all:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I don't actually think there do continue to be unexpected
	side-effects and security exposures with CLONE_NEWUSER.  It takes a
	while for all of the fixes to trickle out to distros.  At most what
	I have seen recently are problems with other kernel interfaces
	being amplified with user namespaces.
</div>
<p>
Others, though, seem to think that, if problems elsewhere are being
"amplified," there is indeed a security exposure.  Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/Articles/673613/">described</a> some concerns of his own:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I consider the ability to use CLONE_NEWUSER to acquire
	CAP_NET_ADMIN over /any/ network namespace and to thus access the
	network configuration API to be a huge risk.  For example,
	unprivileged users can program iptables.  I'll eat my hat if there
	are no privilege escalations in there.
</div>
<p>
Eric echoed the point that making it possible to disable user namespaces would
be a net loss in security, since the feature would not be available on all
systems.  He cited web browsing with Chrome as a use case; Kees <a
href="/Articles/673614/">responded</a> that this patch wasn't really aimed
at desktop systems in the first place.
<p>
Next on Eric's list was a complaint that a system-wide knob was too coarse;
he suggested that perhaps the <tt>seccomp()</tt> mechanism should be used
instead if access to user namespaces must really be restricted.  Kees's
answer here is that it's not really possible to set a global
<tt>seccomp()</tt> policy, that performance would suffer in any case, and
that <tt>seccomp()</tt> is meant for developers to use rather than system
administrators.  "<q>It's an extraordinarily big hammer for wanting to
turn off a single area of the kernel with a long history of
problems.</q>"  He noted that trying to use a Linux security module to
achieve this end would have a number of similar problems.
<p>
Then, Eric said, the sysctl knob could create "<q>a false sense of
security</q>" since it would have no effect on processes that are
already running in a user namespace.  If a security issue comes to light,
just turning off the knob will not be enough to protect a system; a reboot
will also be necessary.  Eric <a href="/Articles/673618/">returned</a> to
this point later, calling the patch "<q>fatally flawed</q>" as a result of
the "<q>subtlety and nuance</q>" involved in using it.
<p>
Kees <a href="/Articles/673620/">acknowledged</a> the "corner case" in the
sysctl implementation, one that, he said, applies to a number of other,
existing knobs as well.  But, he said, it really does not matter to an
administrator who simply wants to disable the feature outright as a way of
reducing the attack surface of a system.  Even so, he allowed: "<q>I'm
open to having this sysctl kill all CLONE_NEWUSERed process trees<q>",
without noting that having a sysctl knob kill off processes might pose some
interesting "subtlety and nuance" of its own.
<p>
As a sort of postscript,
Eric suggested that, perhaps, the desired restriction could be
implemented as a resource limit controlling the number of user namespaces
that any user would be allowed to create.  Setting that number to zero
would effectively disable the feature.  Kees indicated a willingness to
look at this idea; it is the end result he wants, rather than the sysctl
knob itself.
<p>
There is an evident desire for the ability to turn off access to user
namespaces; various other developers spoke in its favor over the course of
the discussion.  But this desire is clearly not universal and, as a
result, the current
patches do not appear to have an easy path into the mainline.  It is
entirely possible that the concerns blocking this feature may eventually be
addressed and overcome, but it also seems possible that, in the end, this
knob ends up being part of the patch set carried by distributors and
users.  It seems that getting security-related changes into the kernel is
still a difficult task.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sysctls are usually set through systemd-sysctl.service, which runs in early boot, way before any users are allowed to log in. So the strategy to write a file with the setting and reboot does the job quite well.<br>
<p>
Also, I don't really buy the argument that setting the sysctl does not work retroactively and this is terrrrrrible. The same is true for most settings... If I had a setuid binary, dropping the bit only affects the future, running instances are not killed. If I change the permissions on a file, processes which had it open just continue. Etc, etc. For example kernel.modules_disabled=1 follows a similar pattern.<br>
<p>
It seems that EB doesn't like that people want to disable some feature which he deeply cares about and loses objectivity. The "shortcomings" of the patch seem like things made up post factum to justify the initial emotional response.<br>
<p>
Also a global per-user limit doesn't seem very useful. If there's a vulnerability, just one namespace is enough to exploit it. And otherwise, why would we care how many namespaced processes are running? So only two values of the limit make sense: 0 and infinity. So we're back to the original sysctl patch.<br>

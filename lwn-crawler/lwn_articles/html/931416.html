<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
Kyungsan Kim began his talk at the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> with a
claim that the Compute Express Link (CXL) technology is leading to
fundamental changes in computer architecture.  The kernel will have to
respond with changes of its own, including in its memory-management layer.
Drawing on some experience gained at Samsung, Kim had a few suggestions on
the form those changes should take — suggestions that ran into some
disagreement from other memory-management developers.
<p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>
CXL, he said, is creating real-world use cases for memory tiering, an
architecture that separates memory with different performance
characteristics and attempts to place each page in an appropriate tier.  A
classic example is placing "hot" (frequently accessed) pages in a fast,
near tier, while cold pages could be placed more remotely — in slower
memory attached via CXL, for example.  Whether any
given page is hot is, in the end, determined by its user, while the
positioning is determined by the provider.  His work has focused on the
provider side, and has led to a set of requirements and proposals.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/931432/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/KyungsanKim-sm.png" alt="[Kyungsan Kim]"
title="Kyungsan Kim" class="lthumb"></a>

The first of those requirements is that users should use NUMA node IDs to
access CXL-hosted memory.  That corresponds to how Linux has implemented
access to such memory to date — by placing it into a separate CPU-less NUMA
node.  Those node IDs themselves do not reflect the distance of any given
memory; a separate API is required for that.
<p>
Kim's second requirement is that the
system should prevent unwanted migration of pages between nodes.  As an
example, he described a system running <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/zswap.html">zswap</a>,
which "swaps" pages by compressing them and storing the result in RAM.  A
zswap configuration could reclaim pages from remote CXL memory and store
the compressed result in fast, local memory, essentially promoting those
pages.  Michal Hocko responded that the solution to that specific problem
was to fix zswap to preserve locality when compressing pages.  David
Hildenbrand added that, if pages are being put into zswap, they have
already been determined to be cold, so it would be better to just put
zswap-compressed pages in slow storage to begin with.
<p>
Kim then presented his first proposal, which was to provide an explicit API
to allocate different types of memory.  In user space, this API would use
the existing <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><tt>mbind()</tt></a>,
and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><tt>set_mempolicy()</tt></a>
system calls.  So, for example, <tt>mmap()</tt> would gain a couple of new
flags: <tt>MMAP_NORMAL</tt> to request a mapping in "normal", local memory,
and <tt>MMAP_EXMEM</tt> to map into CXL-stored, remote memory.  There would
be similar new flags for the NUMA memory-policy system calls.  Within the
kernel, the new <tt>GFP_NORMAL</tt> and <tt>GFP_EXMEM</tt> flags would be
used to explicitly request a given memory type.
<p>
Notably, the defaults are different between the user-space and kernel
interfaces.  User space allocations could be placed in CXL memory unless
the application explicitly specifies otherwise, but the kernel will only
get that memory if it asks for it.  Allowing unmovable kernel allocations
to land in CXL memory could lead to problems if an attempt is made to
unplug that memory in the future.
<p>
Unplugging was the subject of Kim's next requirement: that the ability to
unplug CXL memory must be maintained.  Avoiding kernel-space allocations in
CXL-attached memory is one step in that direction, but it does not avoid
all problems.  User-space memory, too, can end up being non-movable (and
thus block unplugging) in some situations, he said, citing pages that are
pinned for DMA as an example.  Matthew Wilcox objected that,
when user-space pages located in a movable zone are pinned, they are
automatically migrated out of that zone first, so that problem should not
actually exist.  Hocko added that CXL memory should always be configured
outside of <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt> to ensure that kernel allocations will not
be placed there; it would not do to put kernel data structures in memory
with potentially unbounded latency.
<p>
Kim started into the fourth requirement, which was to reduce the number of
CXL nodes that are visible to user space.  Managing all of those nodes can
become unwieldy.  It would be better to, somehow, aggregate CXL resources
into a single node.  There was another requirement to be presented, but at
this point the session had run over time, and the discussion came to an
end.
<p>
<h4>Zoning out</h4>
<p>
The subject was revisited in another session late in the conference, though
Kim's final requirement was never presented.  Meanwhile, it seems that some
of what <i>was</i> presented resulted in some hallway disagreements; in
response, Dan Williams stood in front of the room and proclaimed his intent
to mediate between Kim and his colleagues on one side, and the
memory-management community on the other.  The specific sticking point was
Kim's proposal to add a new <tt>mmap()</tt> flag as described above, and
especially to add a new memory zone (which wasn't covered in the earlier
session, but would be needed to implement the flag).  Neither of those
things is done lightly, he said, but it can happen; similar changes were
made for persistent memory.  Williams said that he had "risked his career"
to get <a href="/Articles/731706/"><tt>MAP_SYNC</tt></a> into the kernel.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/931556/"><img

title="Dan Williams" class="rthumb"></a>

First, though, Williams wanted to talk about the problem to be solved, and
that involved a quick overview of how CXL-attached memory looks to a
system.  On these systems, the host's physical address space is divided
into "windows"; this division is set up in the ACPI tables and does not
change over the life of the system.  Each window is a place where a CXL
host bridge can be mapped; it is possible to map resources from more than
one host bridge into a single window.
<p>
The Linux kernel does "the simple thing" with host bridges for now.
Attached memory is organized into performance classes, then a NUMA node is
created for each class.  Memory from multiple devices can be mapped into
the same node if they all have similar performance.
<p>
When it comes to using this memory, the primary need is to be able to bind
processes to memory of one or more specific performance classes.  At times,
it may also be necessary to create bindings that <i>avoid</i> a given
performance class that might, for example, be too slow for most use.
Processes would only be given memory from that class if they explicitly
request it.  The kernel also needs to avoid most CXL memory for its own
data structures.  There will also certainly be a need to migrate a process
from one performance class to another at times.
<p>
It is currently difficult to bind processes to a
specific class of memory using just the NUMA API.  The problem comes about
when a new node comes online; running applications will not know that they
are able to bind to that new node, and so will not make use of it.  The
solution, it was suggested in the room, is to bind to all <i>possible</i>
nodes, not just those that exist at the time.
<p>
Kim returned to the front of this room at this point to make the case for a
different approach.  Internally, the kernel divides memory into zones with
different characteristics.  <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt> usually contains most
memory, while <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> is meant to be restricted to
allocations that can be moved at need, for example.  Kim said that putting
CXL-attached memory into its own zone might be a better way to reflect its
performance characteristics than using NUMA nodes.  Allocation policies are
generally applied at the zone level, he said, so it is a more natural fit.
<p>
Hocko disagreed, saying that zones are an internal memory-management
concept and should not be exposed outside of the core code.  The right
place for CXL memory will be <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> most of the time.  But
Kim said that the existing zones are not well suited to CXL memory.
<tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt> is not pluggable, he said, while <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>
does not allow pinning, which should be allowed for at least some CXL
memory.  <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt>, which is for memory hosted on attached
devices, does not allow page allocation.
<p>
Kim would, thus, like to add <tt>ZONE_EXMEM</tt> to handle the
peculiarities of CXL memory, which go beyond variable performance
characteristics.  For example, there are other performance-related
concerns; CXL memory is subject to link negotiation and quality-of-service
throttling.  There can be errors caused by connection problems; these tend
not to arise with normal RAM.  CXL memory has sharing and permission
options that are not present with normal memory; it can also implement some
types of asynchronous operations ("sanitize", for example) that the host
need not wait for.
<p>
Williams answered that asynchronous operations can be managed with normal
memory as well, and that regular memory is certainly not immune to errors.
Zones would just add complexity, he said, without enabling anything new.
Kim, though, insisted that a zone-based solution would require fewer code
changes to implement.
<p>
Wilcox argued that exposing zones more widely is an idea that scares
people; zones should be hidden within the memory-management subsystem.
Nodes are sufficient, he added, to do what needs to be done.  Hocko worried
that a single zone would not suffice if that approach were taken; he
wondered how many zones would be needed in the end.  Williams added that
the memory-management developers have been working on integrating
high-bandwidth memory, which is also a whole new class of memory, but
nobody has thought about adding a new zone for it.
<p>
It was the end of the third day of the conference, and everybody was tired.
As thoughts turned toward beer, Williams summarized the current state of
the conversation.  He has not heard, he said, that anybody (other than Kim)
is convinced that nodes are not sufficient for CXL memory, but that the
community could still be convinced otherwise.  Doing so, though, would
require a well-defined use case that cannot be handled with NUMA nodes.  So
the response to adding a new zone is "no" today, but could be changed in
response to a compelling example of why that zone is needed.  That, he
said, is how <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> came about — and it took a two-year
discussion to get there.  The plan to add a new zone for CXL-attached
memory will have to clear a similar bar.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I don't understand the point of MMAP_EXMEM if it's just a single bitflag. If there are potentially an arbitrary number of NUMA nodes with wildly different access latency, it doesn't really narrow down where you want to allocate from. Seems like you either need to be able to pass an explicit node ID with every allocation or you need to change the policy right before every allocation to get that effect?<br>
<p>
When I think about high performance apps I assume they are going to be doing their own management of anticipating what will be hot and cold and determining what tier of memory to use because they will have information the kernel doesn't.<br>

I would encourage Kim to look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/713035/">https://lwn.net/Articles/713035/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/720380/">https://lwn.net/Articles/720380/</a>. We've tried this in the past, but were held back due to HMM at that time. The idea of using a new MMAP is a bit too open, using madvise() and mempolicy() as alternatives might be better suited.<br>

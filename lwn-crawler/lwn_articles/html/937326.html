           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>July 6, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
In the first of two combined BPF and filesystem sessions at the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Hou Tao introduced his BPF iterators
for filesystem information.  <a href="/Articles/926041/">Iterators for
BPF</a> are a relatively recent addition to the BPF landscape; they help
BPF programs step through kernel data structures in a loop-like manner, but
without running afoul of the BPF verifier, which is notoriously hard to
convince about loops.
</p>

<p>
In his remote presentation, Tao began with a quick overview of BPF 
iterators.  They allow users to write a special type of BPF program
that can step through 
kernel data structures in ways that would normally be handled with loops;
instead, the BPF program contains callbacks that are made from the
kernel in response to user-space reads of <a
href="/Articles/664688/">pinned BPF files</a>.   The callback is made for
each new kernel object encountered in the data structure; the code in the
callback can then present information from the object to user space in
whatever format the developer 
wants. 
</p>

<p>
As described in his LSFMM+BPF <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/0a6f0513-b4b3-9349-cee5-b0ad38c81d2e@huaweicloud.com/">topic
proposal</a>, Tao envisions BPF iterators being used for gathering mount
and filesystem information, which was <a href="/Articles/934469/">topic of
a session</a> on the previous day.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230507040107.3755166-1-houtao@huaweicloud.com/">RFC
patch set</a> he posted a few days prior to the summit contains two
iterators to extract information from specific inodes or mounts.  It also
has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230507040107.3755166-5-houtao@huaweicloud.com/">tests to exercise the iterators</a>.
</p>

<p>
He then briefly described the task-file iterator, which is a BPF selftest
shown in the 
<a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/bpf_iterators.html">kernel documentation
for BPF iterators</a>.  A user-space program can load the BPF program
containing the iterator, start the iterator with the ID of the task of
interest, then use the iterator's file descriptor to read some information
for the given task's open files.
</p>

<p>
His idea is that BPF filesystem iterators would provide much more information
than is currently available for various types of kernel objects, such as
superblocks, inodes, directory entries (dentries), mounts, and so on.  He
envisions various use cases, including things like retrieving the order of the
folios in the page cache, getting the page-cache information for files
as an alternative to the <a href="/Articles/917096/">proposed
<tt>cachestat()</tt> system call</a> (which was merged for&nbsp;6.5), and
gathering mount information in a more 
flexible manner than the proposed <tt>fsinfo()</tt> system call.
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner pointed out that a BPF filesystem iterator was not
going to be able to replace a new system call for gathering mount
information.  User-space programs may not be able to—or want to—rely on BPF
for getting that information.  He also has some reservations about exposing
mount information to BPF, in general, due  to "really intricate locking
scenarios".  Tao thought that a BPF helper could be provided that would do
the proper locking.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230507040107.3755166-5-houtao@huaweicloud.com/">mount
iterator from the patch set</a> was up next.  Aleksa Sarai asked if the
intended users were kernel developers or regular user-space programmers; it
looked to him like the iterator was meant for examining problems in the
kernel.  Tao agreed with that, noting that his examples were just trying to
show what a BPF filesystem iterator could do.  He also put up a slide
showing his <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230507040107.3755166-2-houtao@huaweicloud.com/">inode iterator</a>.
</p>

<p>
After an organizer warned that time for the session was running out, Tao
skipped ahead to the problems that need to be addressed.   One problem is
that these iterators require the <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability, so he
wondered if an unprivileged BPF iterator would make sense.  One way might
be to allow regular users to access an iterator via a file pinned in the
BPF filesystem; the permissions could be set by the administrator on the
file to allow (or 
disallow) access.  But, since the facility is targeted for debugging, it
may be fine to only allow it for privileged users, he said.
</p>

<p>
Sarai was concerned that providing that level of detail for, say, a file's
layout in memory to
regular users 
would be detrimental from a security standpoint.  He thought that even if
administrators could enable it for regular users, they should not do so.
He was adamant that it should not be done by default; "if an admin decides
to enable this, they can deal with when someone exploits it".  At that
point, time ran out for the session; one of the organizers suggested that
the conversation continue on the mailing list.

When one thinks of embedded systems, it may be natural to think of
extremely simple processors which are just barely able to perform the tasks
which are asked of them.  That view is somewhat dated, though.
Contemporary processors are often put into settings where they are expected
to manage a variety of peripherals - cameras, signal processors, radios,
etc. - while using a minimum of power.  Indeed, a reasonably capable
system-on-chip (SoC) processor likely has controllers for these peripherals
built in. The result is a processor which presents a high level of
complexity to the operating system.  This article will look at a couple of
patch sets which show how the kernel is changing to deal with these
processors.
<p>
<h4>Power domains</h4>
<p>
On a desktop (or laptop) system, power management is usually a matter of
putting the entire CPU into a low-power state when the load on the system
allows.  Embedded processors are a little different: as noted above, they
tend to contain a wide variety of functional units.  Each of these units
can be powered down (and have its clocks turned off) when it is not needed,
while the rest of the processor continues to function.  The kernel can handle the
powering down of individual subsystems now; what makes things harder is the
power dependencies between devices.
<p>
Power management was one of the motivations behind the addition of the kernel's
device model in the 2.5 development series.  It does not make sense, for
example, to power down a USB controller if devices attached to that
controller remain in operation.  The device model captures the connection
topology of the system; this information can be used to power devices up
and down in a reasonable order.  The result was much improved power
management in the 2.6 kernel.
<p>
On newer systems, though, there are likely to be dependencies between
subsystems that are not
visible in the bus topology.  A set of otherwise unrelated devices may
share the same clock or power lines, meaning that they can only be powered
up or down as a group.  Different SoC designs may feature combinations of
the same controllers with different power connections.  As a result,
drivers for specific controllers often cannot know whether it is safe to
power down their devices - or even how to do it.  This information must be
maintained at a level separate from the device hierarchy if the system is
to be able to make reasonable power management decisions.
<p>
The answer to this problem would appear to be Rafael Wysocki's <a
href="/Articles/449302/">generic I/O power domains</a> patch set.  A power
domain looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct generic_pm_domain {
	struct dev_pm_domain domain;	
	struct list_head sd_node;	
	struct generic_pm_domain *parent;
	struct list_head sd_list;
	struct list_head dev_list;
	bool power_is_off;
	int (*power_off)(struct generic_pm_domain *domain);
	int (*power_on)(struct generic_pm_domain *domain);
	int (*start_device)(struct device *dev);
	int (*stop_device)(struct device *dev);
        /* Others omitted */
    };
</pre>
<p>

Power domains are hierarchical, though the hierarchy may differ from the
bus hierarchy.  So each power domain has a parent domain (<tt>parent</tt>),
a list of sibling domains (<tt>sd_node</tt>), and a list of child domains
(<tt>sd_list</tt>); there is also, naturally, a list of devices contained
within the domain (<tt>dev_list</tt>).  When the kernel is changing a
domain's power state, it can use <tt>start_device()</tt> and
<tt>stop_device()</tt> to operate on specific devices, or
<tt>power_on()</tt> and <tt>power_off()</tt> to power the entire domain up
and down.
<p>
That is the core of the patch though, naturally, there is a lot of
supporting infrastructure to manage domains, let them participate in
suspend and resume, etc.  The one other piece is the construction of the
domain hierarchy itself.  The patch set includes one example
implementation which is added to the ARM "shmobile" subarchitecture board
file.  In the longer term, there will need to be a way to represent power
domains within device trees since board files are intended to go away.
<p>
This patch set has been through several revisions and seems likely to be
merged during the 3.1 development cycle.
<p>
<h4>Asymmetric multiprocessing</h4>
<p>
When one speaks of multiprocessor systems, the context is almost always
symmetric multiprocessing - SMP - where all of the processors are equal.
An embedded SoC may not be organized that way, though.  Consider, for
example, this description from the introduction to <a
href="/Articles/448562/">a patch set from Ohad Ben-Cohen</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	OMAP4, for example, has dual Cortex-A9, dual Cortex-M3 and a C64x+
	DSP.  Typically, the dual cortex-A9 is running Linux in a SMP
	configuration, and each of the other three cores (two M3 cores and
	a DSP) is running its own instance of RTOS in an AMP configuration.
</div>
<p>
Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) is what you get when a system consists of
unequal processors running different operating systems.  It could be
thought of as a form of (very) local-area networking, but all of those
cores sit on the same die and share access to memory, I/O controllers, and
more.  This type of processor isn't simply "running Linux"; instead, it has
Linux running on some processors trying to shepherd a mixed collection of
operating systems on a variety of CPUs. 
<p>
Ohad's patch is an attempt to create a structure within which Linux can
direct a processor of this type.  It starts with a framework called
"remoteproc" that allows the registration of "remote" processors.  Through
this framework, the kernel can power those processors up and down and
manage the loading of firmware for them to run.  Much of this code is
necessarily processor-specific, but the framework abstracts away the
details and allows the kernel to deal with remote processors in a more
generic fashion.

<p>
Once the remote processor is running, the kernel needs to be able to
communicate with it.  To that end, the patch set creates the concept of
"channels" which can be used to pass messages between processors.  These
messages go through a ring buffer stored in memory visible to both
processors; <a href="/Articles/239238/">virtio</a> is used to implement the
rings.  A small piece of processor-specific code is needed to implement a
doorbell to inform processors of when a message arrives; the rest should be
mostly independent of the actual system that it is running on.
<p>
This patch set has been reasonably well received as a good start toward the
goal of regularizing the management of AMP systems.  A complete solution is
likely to require quite a bit more work, including implementations for a
wider variety of architectures.  But, then, one could say that, after
twenty years, Linux as a whole is still working toward a complete
solution.  The hardware continues to evolve toward more complexity; the
operating system will have to keep evolving in response.  These two patch
sets give some hints of the direction that evolution is likely to take in
the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just so people know, even though the two Cortex-A9 cores run in SMP mode on the OMAP4, it is possible to switch one core off altogether if the activity is low enough.<br>

Performance regressions can be an insidious problem for kernel developers.
Individual changes may not have a serious performance impact, but thousands
of changes over a few development cycles can add up.  Chris Mason and Mel
Gorman have been paying attention to performance regressions for some time;
at the 2015 Kernel Summit, they got up to discuss their most recent
findings.  The short story seems to be that, while there is always room for
improvement, there have been few serious performance issues with recent
kernel releases.
<p>
Chris started by saying that Facebook is now running 4.0 kernels on 30% of
its (numerous) systems.  The company currently applies about 90 patches on
top of 
the latest stable update — a relatively small number — and there
appear to be no serious problems.  The size of Facebook's kernel team has
doubled in the last year, but it has only added ten
patches to the set; the rest have gone upstream.
<p>
On the storage side, Chris said, the story is "fantastic."  The <a
href="/Articles/552904/">multiqueue block layer code</a> has made a
significant difference, leading to lower latencies, less system time, and
good stability.  He noted a few starvation issues, but didn't get into
them.  He also said that multiqueue is not particularly useful on rotating
drives, but it makes a huge difference on solid-state drives.
<p>
With regard to networking, most of Facebook's internal traffic is IPv6;
some recent improvements in IPv6 performance have helped a lot there.  The
size of the routing cache has been reduced significantly, taking out a lot
of memory overhead.  The (bufferbloat-related) work to reduce the hardware

align="left"></a> 

packet queues on the interface controllers has helped.  There might be, he
said, room for some improvement with interrupt batching.
<p>
Futex performance has been improved by a patch to reduce contention on the
internal bucket lock; it led to a 1% reduction in the amount of system time
used.  That patch is now in the mainline.
<p>
For filesystems, Chris said that there have been no stability
problems experienced and no performance regressions.  Facebook runs a large
variety of workloads, but doesn't have any real issues with any of them.
<p>
The scheduler, instead, is the source of most problems that they have
experienced at Facebook.  There are problems in the wakeup code that lead
to less-than-optimal CPU use and latencies.  They have put a patch into the
4.3 kernel; it improves things for web-server workloads, but problems
remain with other workloads.
<p>
In particular, Facebook has a workload where a small number of threads run at
nearly 100% CPU time, while something on the order of 100 other threads
will occasionally wake up to do some small task.  This workload sees 10%
higher latencies and gets 2-5% less user-mode CPU time with the 4.0 kernel
than it 
did with 3.10.  Somehow processes are just not getting to the CPU quickly
when they become runnable; it seems that the scheduler is pushing the
workload onto too few CPUs, leaving others idle.  There is something in
<tt>find_busiest_group()</tt> that is making the wrong decision, he said.
<p>
At this point, Mel took over to say that, from his point of view (watching
over performance for SUSE), there have not been that many scheduler
problems.  His biggest complaint, instead, was with the Intel "pstate"
driver, which handles CPU frequency and voltage management on Intel
processors.  This driver, he said, is making poor decisions.  CPUs never
seem to go above the minimum frequency on lightly-loaded machines, with
results that <i>look</i> like a 10-20% scheduler performance regression,
but are really due to pstate.  This is, he said, a serious issue; we are at
a point where we are extremely efficient at doing nothing, but not so good
at actually doing work.  As a result, a lot of users are disabling pstate
altogether.
<p>
Mel also noted problems with client/server workloads that involve a lot of
synchronous wakeups (one process wakes the other and waits for some
result).  The kernel would once try to keep both processes on the same CPU,
which would reduce
latencies, but that no longer happens.  There are good reasons for the

<a href="/Articles/662832/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/klf-ks/MelGorman-sm.jpg" width=250 height=312
alt="[Mel Gorman]" title="Mel Gorman" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

change in behavior, he said, but there is also a cost.  Performance on
database workloads, for example, used to be smooth over time; now it is
spiky, though the average throughput is about the same.  Synchronous
wakeups, he said, have historically been a difficult problem.
<p>
Distributions are moving toward enabling multiqueue block I/O as the
default, he said, but that can lead to performance regressions on rotating
media.  Jens Axboe noted that multiqueue is currently controlled by a
single "on or off" setting.  A near-future likely change is the addition of
a flag that only enables multiqueue operation on non-rotational storage.
The alternative would be to introduce an I/O scheduler for multiqueue I/O,
but that would be a bigger step.
<p>
Another problem has surfaced within the memory-management subsystem, Mel
said.  Storage is now so fast that the kernel's memory reclaim decisions no
longer make any sense.  A lot of decisions are driven by congestion on
backing-store devices but, now, there is never any congestion.  The result
is that the system ends up thrashing.  There are a lot of assumptions in
the memory-management code that no longer hold true; fixing those could be
a long process.
<p>
Mel closed with a problem that looks like a kernel performance regression,
but isn't.  It seems systemd is configuring all system daemons into the
same control group, which causes them to all compete against each other
under the block I/O controller.  It is, he said, a user-space configuration
error that can hurt performance.  There was some talk about whether it
makes sense to put kernel threads into control groups at all, but Peter
Zijlstra pointed out that this capability is useful for people who want to
isolate some CPUs from system activity.  There may be other ways to
mitigate this problem from the kernel side, but it's not clear that they
are the best solution.  Mel warned the group that there may be a fight
about this particular issue coming in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thank you for this article. Gives a good update on what is the current status and what else is planned in the performance space.<br>
<p>
When mq was introduced, it promised a lot of improvements. But as is mentioned here, the improvements are negligible or none on rotational drives.<br>

… for some newer systems. There is plenty of rotating rust (or other relatively slow devices, like SD cards) left which still requires paying attention to storage latency.<br>

Presumably it'll get ripped out, people will complain that all non-server workloads are slow, and then some third way will get merged in 5-10 years.<br>

IIRC systemd/system.conf used to have a "ControlGroupsEnabled" (or Used or Disabled or something) and that option went away (a year or so ago). So now if I don't want to enable a particular control group for all system daemons because it has a lot of overhead, the easiest way is to configure it out of the kernel entirely...<br>

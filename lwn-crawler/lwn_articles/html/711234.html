<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 11, 2017</br>
           </div>
One of the features pulled into the mainline during the 4.10 merge window
is the ability to attach a BPF program to a control group; that program can
then filter packets received or transmitted by processes within the control
group.  The feature itself is relatively uncontroversial (though <a
href="/Articles/698073/">some would prefer</a> a different
implementation).  Until recently, the feature's interface and semantics
were also uncontroversial — or at least not closely examined.  Since the
feature was merged, however, some concerns have been raised.  The development
community will have to decide whether changes need to be made, or the
feature temporarily disabled, before the 4.10 release sets the interface in
stone.
<p>
The conversation was <a href="/Articles/711235/">started by</a> Andy
Lutomirski, who played with the new capability for a while and found a few
things that worried him.  The first of these is that the <tt>bpf()</tt>
system call is used to attach the program to the control group.  This is,
he thinks, fundamentally a control-group operation, not a BPF operation, so
it should be handled through the control-group interface.  If, in the
future, somebody adds the ability to impose other types of controls —
controls that don't 
involve BPF programs — then the use of <tt>bpf()</tt> would make no sense.
And, in any case, he said, <tt>bpf()</tt> is an increasingly unwieldy
multiplexer system call.
<p>
This objection didn't get far; there does not seem to be a large contingent
of developers interested in adding other packet-filtering mechanisms to control
groups.  BPF developer Alexei Starovoitov <a
href="/Articles/711238/">dismissed</a> the idea, suggesting that any other
mechanism could be just as easily implemented in BPF.  Networking
maintainer David Miller <a href="/Articles/711239/">agreed</a> with
Starovoitov on this issue, so it seems that little is likely to change on
this point.
<p>
The next issue runs a little deeper.  Control groups are hierarchical in
nature and, with version&nbsp;2 of the control-group interface, all
controllers are expected to behave in a fully hierarchical manner.  The BPF
filter mechanism is not a proper controller (a bit of an interface oddity
in its own right), but its behavior in control-group hierarchies is still
of interest.  Controller policies are normally composed as one moves down
the hierarchy.  For example, if a control group is configured with the CPU
controller to have 10% of the available CPU time, then a sub-group of that
group is configured to get 50%, it will end up with 50% of the 10% the
parent group has, or 5% in absolute terms.
<p>
If a process is running in a two-level control group hierarchy, where both
levels have filter programs attached, one might think that <i>both</i>
filters would be run — that the restrictions imposed by those filters would
be additive.  But that is not what happens; instead, only the filter
program at the lowest level is run, while those at higher levels are
ignored.  The upper level filter might prohibit certain kinds of traffic,
but the mere existence of a lower-level filter overrides that prohibition.
In a setting where one administrator is setting filters at all levels,
these semantics might not be a problem.  But if one wants to set up a
system with containers and user namespaces, where containers can
add filter programs of their own, this behavior would
allow the system-level policy to be circumvented.
<p>
Starovoitov <a href="/Articles/711242/">acknowledged</a> that, at a
minimum, there might be a use case for composing all the filters in a given
hierarchy.  But he also asserted that "<q>the current semantics is fine
for what it's designed for</q>" and said that different behavior can be
implemented in the future.  The problem with that approach is that changing
the semantics would be a significant ABI change that could easily break
systems that were designed around the 4.10 semantics; such a change would
not be allowed.  In the absence of a plan for how the new semantics could
be added in a compatible way, it has to be assumed that, if 4.10 is
released with the 
current behavior, nobody will be able to change it going forward.
<p>
Other developers (<a href="/Articles/711244/">Peter Zijlstra</a> and <a
href="/Articles/711245/">Michal Hocko</a>) have expressed concerns about
this behavior as well.  Zijlstra asked control-group maintainer Tejun Heo
for his thoughts on the matter, but no such thoughts have been forthcoming
as of this writing.  Starovoitov seems convinced that the current semantics
are not problematic, and that they can be changed in some (unspecified) way
without breaking compatibility in the future.
<p>
Lutomirski's final worry is a bit more nebulous.  Until now, control
groups have been concerned with resource control; the addition of BPF
filters changes the game.  These programs could be another way for an
attacker to run hostile code; they could, for example, interfere with the
input to a setUID program, leading to potential privilege escalation
issues.  The programs could also stash useful information where an attacker
could find it.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This sounds a lot like seccomp with a narrower scope but a much
	stronger ability to exfiltrate private information.
<p>
	Unfortunately, while seccomp is very, very careful to prevent
	injection of a privileged victim into a malicious sandbox, the
	CGROUP_BPF mechanism appears to have no real security model. There
	is nothing to prevent a program that's in a malicious cgroup from
	running a setuid binary.
</div>	
<p>
For now, attaching a network filter program is a privileged operation, so
exploits are not an immediate concern.  But as soon as somebody tries to
make it work within user namespaces a whole new can of worms would be
opened up.  Lutomirski put out a "<a href="/Articles/711246/">half-baked
proposal</a>" that would prevent the creation of "dangerous" control groups
(those that have filter programs attached) unless various conditions were
met to prevent privilege escalation issues in the future.
<p>
That proposal has not met with a lot of approval.
Once again, such restrictions would need to be imposed from the outset to limit
the risk of breaking systems in the future; that would imply that this
feature would need to be disabled for the 4.10 release.  But there seems to
be little interest in doing that; while Starovoitov <a
href="/Articles/711247/">agreed</a> early on that there was work to be done
in the security area, he once again said that it could be done at some
future point.
<p>
That is where the discussion stands, as of this writing.  If no action is
taken, 4.10 will be released with a new feature despite the existence of
concerns about its ABI and security.  History has some clear lessons about
what can happen when new ABIs are shipped with this kind of unanswered
question; indeed, one need not look beyond control groups for examples of
the kinds of problems that can be created.  Given the probable outcome
here, one can only hope that the BPF developers are correct that some way
can be found to address the semantic and security issues without creating
ABI compatibility problems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The mismatch with the existing per-socket BPF programs is also concerning: the cgroups one will execute on L3 packets while the per-socket ones will execute on L2 packets. The per-socket ones cannot filter egress packets while those one can.<br>

The per-socket BPF program will only execute on L2 packets if the socket is AF_PACKET. The per-socket BPF program also works on AF_INET or AF_UNIX and in those cases, it is not L2.<br>
<p>
Other kinds of BPF programs such as BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE is also very different and doesn't even run on a packet. I don't think it is a problem to have different kinds of BPF programs for different purposes.<br>

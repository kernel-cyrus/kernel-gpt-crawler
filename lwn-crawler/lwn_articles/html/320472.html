<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 24, 2009</br>
           </div>
Once upon a time, the Video4Linux (V4L) development community was seen as a
discordant group which hung out in its own playpen and which had not
managed to implement support for much of the available hardware.  Times
have changed; the V4L community is energetic and productive, disruptive
flame wars have all but disappeared from the V4L mailing lists, and Linux
now supports a large majority of the hardware which can be found on the
market.  As this community moves forward, it is reorganizing things on many
fronts; among other things, they are working on the creation of the first
true framework for video capture devices.  The V4L developers are also
having to look at their code management practices; in the process they are
encountering a number of issues which have been faced by other subsystems
as well.
<p>
The discussion started with <a href="/Articles/320473/">this RFC from Hans
Verkuil</a>.  Hans points out that the size of the V4L subsystem (as found
under <tt>drivers/media</tt> in the kernel source) has grown significantly
in recent years - it is 2.5 times larger now than it was in the 2.6.16
kernel.  This growth is a sign of success: V4L has added features and
support for a vast array of new hardware in this time.  But it has its
costs as well - that is a lot of code to maintain.
<p>
As it happens, the V4L developers make that maintenance even harder by
incorporating backward compatibility into their tree.  The tree run by V4L
maintainer Mauro Carvalho Chehab does not support just the current mainline
kernel; instead, it can be built on any kernel from 2.6.16 forward.  This
is not a small trick, considering that the majority of that code did not
exist when 2.6.16 was released.  There have been some major internal kernel API
changes over that time; supporting all those kernels requires a complicated
array of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s, compatibility headers, and more.  It takes a lot
of work to keep this compatibility structure in place.  Additionally, this
kind of compatibility code is not welcome in the mainline kernel, so it
must all be stripped out prior to sending code upstream.
<p>
The reason for this practice is relatively straightforward: the V4L
developers would like to make it possible for testers to try out new
drivers without forcing them to install a leading-edge mainline kernel.
This is the same reasoning that the DRM developers gave at the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/298842/">2008 Kernel Summit</a>: allowing
testers to build modules for older kernels makes life easier for them.  And
that, in turn, leads to more testing of current code.  But the cost of this
compatibility is high, so Hans is proposing a few changes.
<p>
One of those would be in how the subsystem tree is managed.  Currently,
this tree is maintained in a Mercurial repository which represents only the
V4L subsystem (it is not a full kernel tree), and which contains the
backward compatibility patches.  This organization makes interaction with
the kernel development process harder in a number of ways.  Beyond the
effort required to maintain backward compatibility, the separate tree makes
it harder to integrate patches written against the mainline kernel, and
there is no way for this tree to contain patches which affect kernel code
outside of <tt>drivers/media</tt>.  Life would be easier if developers
could simply work against an ordinary mainline kernel tree.
<p>
So Hans suggests moving to a tree organization modeled on the techniques
developed by the ALSA project.  The ALSA maintainers (who also keep
backward compatibility patches) use as their primary tree a clone of the
mainline git repository.  Backward compatibility changes are then
retrofitted into a separate tree which exists just for that purpose.  By
working against a mainline tree, the ALSA developers interact more smoothly
with the rest of the kernel development process.  The down side is that
creating the backward-compatible tree requires more work; a team of V4L
developers would have to commit to putting time toward that goal.
<p>
And that leads, of course, to the biggest question: what is the real value
of the backward compatibility work, and how far back should the project go?
There seems to be little interest in dropping compatibility with older
kernels altogether; the value to testers and developers both seems to be
too high.  But it is not clear that it is really necessary to support
kernels all the way back to 2.6.16.  So, asks Hans, what is the oldest
kernel that the project should support?
<p>
Hans has a clear objective here: the i2c changes which were merged for
2.6.22 create a boundary beyond which backward compatibility gets
significantly harder.  If kernels before 2.6.22 could be dropped, a lot of
backward compatibility hassles would go away.  But convenience is not the
only thing to bear in mind when dropping support; one must also consider
whether that change will significantly reduce the number of testers who can
try out the code.  It would also be good to have some sort of objective
policy on backward compatibility support so that older kernels could be
dropped in the future without the need for extensive discussions.
<p>
The proposed policy is this: V4L backward compatibility should support the
oldest kernels supported by "the three major distros" (Fedora, openSUSE,
and Ubuntu).  For the moment, that kernel, conveniently, happens to be
2.6.22, which will be supported by Ubuntu 7.10 until April, 2009.
(Interestingly, Hans seems to have skipped over the 6.06 "Dapper Drake"
release - supported until June, 2009 - which runs a bleeding-edge 2.6.15
kernel).  A quick <a href="/Articles/320489/">poll</a> run by Hans suggests
that there is little opposition to removing support for kernels prior to
2.6.22.
<p>
There is some, though: John Pilkington <a href="/Articles/320490/">points
out</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think you should be aware that the mythtv and ATrpms communities
	include a significant number of people who have chosen to use the
	CentOS_5 series in the hope of getting systems that do not need to
	be reinstalled every few months.  I hope you won't disappoint them.
</div>
<p>
CentOS 5 (like the RHEL5 distribution it is built from) shipped with a
2.6.18 kernel.  It seems, though, that <a href="/Articles/320491/">there is
little sympathy for CentOS</a> (or any other "enterprise" distribution) in
the development community.  Running a distribution designed to be held
stable for several years and wanting the latest hardware support are seen
to be contradictory goals.  So it seems unlikely that the V4L tree will be
managed with the needs of enterprise distributions in mind.
<p>
Thus far, no actual decisions have been made.  Mauro, who as the subsystem
maintainer would be expected to have a strong voice in any such decision,
has not yet shown up in the discussion.  Given the lack of any strong
opposition to the proposals, though, it would be surprising if those
proposals are not adopted in some form.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think this is another sign that someday the "no stable API" policy will have to be weakened.  I am sure that it will not be dropped, but I think it will end up as a "stablish APIs" policy, where there are occasional big breaks (hopefully timed so that big breaks in different places co-incide) and some minimal work required on the part of driver developers to work with new kernels without losing compatibility with old ones.  So that in-tree drivers will end up working on the last few kernel releases as well, possibly not in .0 kernel releases, but after a few minor releases.<br>

<p>
I wonder what the other signs are. In fact, all I can see is that the API churn is accelerating, and that out-of-tree drivers are less and less frequent - only the ones with big teams devoted to following kernel changes may hope to be constantly up-to-date.<br>

Hmm, I regarded the Ubuntu LTS releases as their equivalent of an <br>
enterprise release, so I didn't count it. In this case it is a moot <br>
point, since 2.6.15 hasn't been supported by v4l-dvb since 8 months or <br>
so.<br>

Interestingly, nobody ever complained about that, thus also confirming my <br>

<p>
End users?  What have we learned about end users, and what difference does it make?
<p>
According to the article, the goal of making V4L work on old kernels is to enable <em>testers</em>.  I don't consider those end users.  And I don't expect that community to have a strong affinity to stable systems.
<p>
And the discussion is on the linux-media mailing list, which I will bet is not subscribed to by all V4L users or even a sample -- again, subscribers are probably people who don't value stability much (i.e. they upgrade regularly).
<p>
So my guess is that 1) there are plenty of end users who will be disappointed at the loss of new V4L for old kernels; and 2) that doesn't mean you should keep producing it.

There's so much wrong with this idea, it's almost impossible to begin to address it all. But there's little point in discussing it, since someone will inevitably post Greg K-H's "Stable API Nonsense" document and claim that proves something, or tell me to just use Windows.

If your testing drivers you really should be comfortably with running<br>
more bleeding kernels. As the userspace ABI is kept pretty stable<br>
there shouldn't be a problem running your current userspace on a more<br>
modern kernel. Certainly when I've been playing with DRM I just run<br>
the current intel-next git tree kernel.<br>
<p>
Having said that I do appreciate the wireless-testing tree that<br>
allowed me to install the latest drivers for my netbook wireless while<br>
sticking to the vendor kernel. Their backwards compatibility doesn't<br>
jump through too many hoops though. However I don't really test stuff on my<br>
netbook as having working suspend/resume is more important to me. On<br>
my desktop I'll quite happily run anything from rc2 up.<br>

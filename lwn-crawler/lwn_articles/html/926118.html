           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 16, 2023</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/903855/">ublk subsystem</a> enables the creation of
user-space block drivers that communicate with the kernel using <a
href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a>.  Drivers implemented this way show
some promise with regard to performance, but there is a bottleneck in the
way: copying data between the kernel and the user-space driver's address
space.  It is thus not surprising that there is interest in implementing
zero-copy I/O for ublk.  The mailing lists have recently seen three
different proposals for how this could be done.
<p>
<h4>1: Use BPF</h4>
<p>
There are few problems in the kernel, it seems, that cannot be
addressed by throwing some BPF into the mix, and zero-copy ublk I/O would
appear to be no exception.  <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20230222132534.114574-1-xiaoguang.wang@linux.alibaba.com/">This
patch set</a> from Xiaoguang Wang adds a new program type
(<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_UBLK</tt>) that can be loaded by ublk drivers and
subsequently registered with one or more specific ublk devices.  Once that
happens, I/O requests generated by the kernel will be passed to that
program rather than being sent to the user-space driver for execution.
There is a new BPF helper function (<i>not</i> a kfunc, for unclear
reasons) called <tt>bpf_ublk_queue_sqe()</tt> that allows BPF programs to
add requests to the ring; this helper can be used to queue the I/O
operations that fulfill the original block request.
<p>
There are a few advantages to handling these requests entirely in the
kernel, starting with the ability to eliminate round trips with the
user-space daemon.  The biggest win, though, is likely to come from the
fact that the BPF program has access to the buffers provided by the kernel
and can use them directly for whatever I/O is needed to satisfy each
request, eliminating a copy of that data.  Block drivers can move quite a
bit of data, so the advantage of avoiding copies should be clear.  That
said, this patch (like all the others discussed here) lacks benchmark
results showing the performance improvement it enables.
<p>
<h4>2: Fused operations</h4>
<p>
Ming Lei, the author of the original ublk patches, has <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20230314125727.1731233-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/">a
rather different approach</a>.  Like ublk itself, this work is minimally
documented and difficult to read, so this description is the result of a
reverse-engineering effort and may well be wrong in some respects.
<p>
Operations in an io_uring ring are usually entirely separate from each
other.  There is a way to link them so that one operation must complete
before the next can be dispatched, but otherwise each operation is
distinct.  Lei's patch set provides a rather tighter link between
operations by adding the concept of "fused" operations â€” two operations
that are tied together and which can share resources between them.
<p>
When a user-space ublk driver is running, it will receive commands from the
kernel, via the ring, with instructions like "read N blocks from device D
at offset O".  With Lei's series applied, the driver will have the option
to turn that operation into a fused command that is placed back into the
ring for execution in the kernel.  A fused command is <i>two</i> io_uring
commands that are tied together; they must be submitted as a single unit.
The "master" command (Lei's terminology) is of type
<tt>IORING_OP_FUSED_CMD</tt>; it contains enough information for the ublk
subsystem to connect the command to a request sent to the user-space
driver.  The "slave" command, instead, performs the actual I/O needed to
satisfy that request.
<p>
As with the BPF solution, the key here is that the slave command has access
to the buffer associated with the master; in this case, the slave command
can access the kernel-space buffers associated with the original block I/O
request. Once again, that allows the I/O to be performed without copying
the data to or from the user-space driver.  Once the slave command
completes, the user-space driver can signal completion of the original
block I/O request to the kernel in the usual way.
<p>
The fused-command functionality is a special-purpose beast; it will not
work in any sort of general case.  The subsystem receiving the fused
command must have special support for it and, specifically, it must be able
to locate the kernel-space buffer for the slave command and make the
connection with a call to the new function
<tt>io_fused_cmd_provide_kbuf()</tt> before the slave can execute.  It is a
fair amount of change to the io_uring subsystem, and it is not entirely
clear that any other subsystem would be able to make use of it.
<p>
<h4>3: Use <tt>splice()</tt></h4>
<p>
In the discussion after <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20230307141520.793891-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/">version
2 of Lei's patch set</a> was posted, Pavel Begunkov <a
href="/ml/linux-block/7e05882f-9695-895d-5e83-61006e54c4b2@gmail.com/">observed</a>
that "<q>it all looks a bit complicated and intrusive</q>".  He thought
that it might be possible to, instead, reuse the mechanisms for the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html"><tt>splice()</tt></a>
system call.  The io_uring "registered buffer" feature would be used to
facilitate zero-copy operation.  Shortly thereafter, he posted <a
href="/ml/linux-block/ce96f7e7-1315-7154-f540-1a3ff0215674@gmail.com/">a
preliminary, proof-of-concept implementation</a>; it showed how this
approach could work but was not complete.
<p>
Lei had a number of questions about this approach, mostly focused on how
the buffer management works.  It is not clear how well the
<tt>splice()</tt> approach would work if I/O needs to be performed on a
given buffer more than once â€” for example, when writing to a mirrored block
device.  The questions kept coming, and Begunkov has not (as of this
writing) posted a complete version of the patch.  It seems likely that the
<tt>splice()</tt> approach will not go much further, though surprises can
always happen.
<p>
Wang, meanwhile, has <a
href="/ml/linux-block/fd30b561-86dd-5061-714f-e46058f7079f@linux.alibaba.com/">said</a>
that the fused-command approach seems like "<q>the right direction
to support ublk zero copy</q>".
<p>
As was noted in the original ublk article, one of the key practical
problems that has impeded the microkernel approach to operating-system
design is the cost of communication between the components.  Ublk has
managed to reduce that cost considerably, but there is more to be gained if
the cost of copying data between the kernel and user space can be
eliminated.  So chances are good that developers will continue to work on
this problem until some sort of workable solution has been found.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Another way to see the difference is to run ublk-null in zero copy mode[1], which simply<br>
bypasses data copy between io request pages and ublk server user buffer. IOPS boost can<br>
be ~5X in this way with 64k/512k block size.<br>

Hello,<br>
<p>
We did some tests on our EBPF patches. We manually let IOPS reach the bottleneck of our storage device so that we could fairly compare CPU usage between EBPF and baseline(current ublk).<br>
We noticed that the CPU usage dropped to 1%. In our product, CPU usage is much more important than IOPS because our RPC backend is so complicated that ublk cannot boost IOPS too much.<br>

Thanks for making this as one lwn document!<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; The fused-command functionality is a special-purpose beast; </span><br>
<p>
The patchset addresses zero copy between device io buffer and io uring OPs in one generic way.<br>
<p>
Any device can implement -&gt;uring_cmd() for supporting this feature, so I do not agree it is one<br>
special-purpose beast.<br>
<p>
The thing is that we don't many such requirement, and antother user is fuse FS.<br>
<p>
Also it might help net recv zero copy a bit, see the following link:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/ZBnTuX+5D8QeLPuQ@ovpn-8-18.pek2.redhat.com/T/#m0b8d0dcca5024765cef0439ef1d8ca3f7b38bd1c">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/ZBnTuX+5D8QeLPuQ@ovpn...</a><br>
<p>
BTW, given we only have kernel pages, and there can't be user space VM mapping<br>
for these pages, so exporting these pages to userspace doesn't make any sense. However,<br>
BPF might be one perfect supplement here, such as:<br>
<p>
- add one generic io_uring BPF OP, which can run one specified registered BPF program by<br>
passing bpf_prog_id<br>
<p>
- link this BPF OP as slave request of fused command, then the bpf prog can do whatever on<br>
the kernel pages, and return results into user via any bpf mapping(s)<br>
<p>
- then userspace can decide how to handle the result from bpf mapping(s), such as,<br>
submit another fused command to handle IO with part of the kernel buffer.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; splice based approach</span><br>
<p>
I don't think splice is one good solution, see details in the following doc:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/ming1/linux/blob/my_v6.3-io_uring_fuse_cmd_v4/Documentation/block/ublk.rst#zero-copy">https://github.com/ming1/linux/blob/my_v6.3-io_uring_fuse...</a><br>
<p>
The above doc also provides basic techinical requirements for ublk zero copy feature.<br>

<p>
fused command becomes more generic in V6 [1], and it models<br>
relationship between primary request and secondary requests,<br>
and sharing resource between them, one core idea is to align resource's<br>
lifetime with primary command, so provide one safe way to sharing<br>
resource among  kernel subsystems.<br>
<p>
There are more use cases mentioned in patch 3/17 [2].<br>
<p>
Now sharing/providing buffer  can be thought as one plugin of fused command,<br>
and more plugins could be added in future.<br>

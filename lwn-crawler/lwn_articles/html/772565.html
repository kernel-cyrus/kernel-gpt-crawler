           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 20, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2018-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
There has been a great deal of discussion around the kernel project's
recently adopted code of conduct (CoC), but little of that has happened in an
open setting.  That changed to an extent when a panel discussion was held
during the Kernel Summit track at the 2018 <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>.
Panelists Mishi Choudhary, Olof Johansson, Greg Kroah-Hartman, and Chris
Mason took on a number of issues surrounding the CoC in a generally
calm and informative session.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman began by apologizing for the process by which the code was
adopted.  Linus Torvalds wanted something quickly, Kroah-Hartman said, so
the process was rushed and a lot of political capital was burned to get the
code into the kernel.  He has since been trying to make up for things by
talking to a lot of people; while he apologized for how things happened, he
also insisted that it was necessary to take that path.  The "code of
conflict" that preceded the current code was also pushed into the kernel
over a period of about three weeks; "we have been here before", he said.
<p>
The current status is that we have a code of conduct and an interpretation
document that describes how the code will be viewed in the kernel
community.  There is an email alias for the reporting of problems, and work
is underway to set up a group to handle problems that is separate from the

<a href="/Articles/772570/"><img

title="The CoC panel" width=350 height=286 hspace=3 vspace=3 border=0
align="right"></a>

Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board (TAB), which is currently charged with
that task.  He noted that putting the TAB in that role is nothing new,
though; the TAB was also responsible for handling complaints under the old
code of conflict.
<p>
Mishi Choudhary has been appointed as a mediator for difficult
code-of-conduct issues.  She introduced herself by congratulating the
kernel community as a whole, saying that everybody celebrates our
way of 
creating software.  The kernel's success will lead to the continued growth of
the kernel community, meaning that we will have a lot of new people to
welcome.   She is there to help in any way she can, she said.
<p>
Though originally from India, Choudhary is now based in New York, where she
has been working with the open-source community for twelve years as a
lawyer for groups like the Free Software Foundation, the Apache Software
Foundation, and the OpenSSL project.  In her current role at the Software
Freedom Law Center, she has to deal with conduct-related issues, so she has the
experience to help.  The important thing, she said, is to be excellent and
kind to each other; fairness and due process are not in conflict with
kindness.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman jumped in with one other thing he wanted to mention: a lot of
people have ideas for how they might like to change the code of conduct.
One sentence that didn't work with our community (making maintainers
responsible for enforcing the code) has been removed but, in general, he
suggested that  it would be better to work with <a
href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">the upstream project</a> to
propose changes.  Kroah-Hartman noted that many people have complaints
about the author of the code of conduct; he responded that he, personally,
has a number of disagreements with Richard Stallman, but still uses
Stallman's license.  We don't have to agree with the author of the code, he
said, and we can expect it to improve over time.
<p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>
Frank Rowand said that any objections to the author are beside the point,
it is the political objectives behind the document that many find
objectionable.  Kroah-Hartman answered that he doesn't agree with much of
Stallman's intent either, but that is not a problem.  We are using the code
for the value it provides to us, and not to further somebody else's
political objectives.

Rowand continued by saying that the code has an intent that is antithetical
to many in the community, and that needs to be acknowledged.  In
particular, its anti-meritocracy objective does not sit well with many.
Rik van Riel responded that we need to rethink what we mean by
"meritocracy"; true merit includes working well with others.
<p>
Mel Gorman said that we should treat the code as a specification, not an
implementation.  The kernel community is creating its own implementation of
that specification, and we often deviate from specifications when it makes
sense to us; this case is no different.  Treating merit as a
black-and-white quantity is dangerous, he added; it can be exclusionary and
restrict junior developers who have the capacity to learn.  We should not
get too hung up on meritocracy, and we should not be too worried about the
code of conduct.  We just need to focus on our own implementation.  He
finished by noting that, since he is Irish, he has a way of dealing with
people that's incompatible with almost everybody else.  He has to mediate
his responses; others should be able to do the same.
<p>
Shuah Khan said that "meritocracy" means that we will not accept a
reduction in the quality of our code.  But we can reject code with polite
language; indeed, we have always done that, with just a few exceptions.
Kroah-Hartman said the biggest change is that there will be no more
exceptions.
<p>
Mauro Carvalho Chehab said that the changes that have been made — the
removal of maintainer responsibility, the interpretation document, and the
appointment of a mediator — are all important.  But he is still unsure
about how the code will interact with the law in different countries.  He
mentioned the right to be forgotten as a particular problem in this
regard.  Kroah-Hartman replied that lawyers at the Linux Foundation and
elsewhere have long since concluded that the work done in the kernel
community is public and that we cannot be expected to edit it out, so the
right to be forgotten does not apply.  Mason added that he can sympathize
with people who have legal concerns; the TAB can try to connect people with
lawyers to get answers to specific questions when the need arises.
<p>
Rowand said that the real goal is to create a better and more inclusive
community.  What else can we do to solve the real problems that we have?
Kroah-Hartman said that the Linux Foundation would be announcing some
initiatives soon.  He also mentioned the work that is being done to create
a maintainer's handbook as a step in that direction.

Laura Abbott said that, while supporting new developers is important,
experienced developers also need to treat each other well.  Kroah-Hartman
said that he "got to play Linus for a month" and that the experience was
not much fun.  Every maintainer does things differently.  There is a lot
that we all can do to make life easier for other maintainers.
<p>
Johansson said that, as a community, we have long optimized for keeping the
people we care about around; we want them to be there in the future to
support their code.  Some of that pressure is being relieved by the new set
of development tools and testing programs, though; it is easier to be sure
that code is in good shape when it goes into the kernel and should help us
to broaden the contributor base.
<p>
<h4>Maintainer responsibility</h4>
<p>
Gorman warned that the community should be wary of placing responsibility
for upholding the code of conduct on any specific individuals.  The load on
maintainers is high now; it will become worse 
if maintainers are made responsible for more tasks.  There will always be
members of our community, he said, who are not suited to mentoring
contributors.  When I see an example of somebody being "crucified" in a
review, he said, we all have the responsibility to intervene.  It is
possible to tear a patch apart without ever explaining what would make the
patch acceptable; such a review can be "very friendly" but also quite
unhelpful.  Complaining to the TAB will not help in such situations;
instead, the best thing to do is to enter the conversation and help the
contributor figure out what they need to do.  It is not fair to put that
responsibility on any one maintainer, or on the TAB.
<p>
Dan Williams said that part of the problem is that he doesn't always have
the time or ability to mentor contributors, or he doesn't know what to
suggest to them without trying to solve the problem himself.  It's not
always easy to see how you want the problem solved in the end.  Johansson
said that, if you're the only one who can review patches in your subsystem,
you have a growth opportunity for somebody else.  Try to find that person
and bring them up to speed; that is how we develop new maintainers.  Ted
Ts'o added that the only power in a volunteer organization is the ability
to say "no"; it's nearly impossible to compel people to do things.  So
telling maintainers to make something happen will not work.  The only way
is for people to improve things themselves and to recruit others to help. 
<p>
Mason said that almost all patches receive one of four possible answers:
"yes", "no", "no with reasons", and "no with reasons and a long story about
how terrible the patch is".  He would like to get rid of the last type of
answer, which is not helpful.  If the code of conduct can do that, he said,
we will be better off in the end.
<p>
Abbott said that most code-of-conduct issues are things that maintainers
and developers can handle themselves.  Escalation is not needed, good
judgment is enough.  The code is mostly a way to establish what we value
and a plan in case we have to deal with a more serious issue someday; she
hopes that we will never need it.  Choudhary also hoped that she would
never be needed.  Each community figures out how it wants to resolve these
problems, she said; the kernel community will be able to do the same.
Johansson said that the TAB isn't just there as a sort of police force;
anybody is encouraged to reach out with questions or for help.
<p>
Jes Sorensen said that, while there has been a lot of talk about how we
need to be helpful, one of our bigger problems is contributors who refuse
to listen.  Some of them are just stubborn; others are overtly trying to
provoke a reaction.  How do we cope with such people?  Kroah-Hartman said
that this problem is outside of the code of conduct.  We have dealt with
such problems in the past, with the worst offenders being banned from the
mailing lists.  Sorensen was unconvinced, though, citing problems with
contributors who have worked on a body of code for years and keep pushing
it even after it has been rejected.  Such problems will happen again, he
said.
<p>
A solution to that problem will have to wait, though, as the session ran
out of time and came to an end.  The overall feeling was one of wary
acceptance; kernel developers generally agree with the goals of the code of
conduct (as expressed within the community) and hope that the actual
outcome will consistent with those goals.

This isn't a code-of-conduct issue, but we also need to eliminate that second answer. "no" without reasons is not helpful.<br>

I think the acceptable responses are:<br>
<p>
Yes<br>
No, the idea is terrible and here's why<br>
No, the idea is good, but the implementation is bad and here are some suggestions<br>

Silence is also acceptable. We can't expect maintainers to reply to every email.<br>

Agreed. There's a bit of a spectrum there as well, in that the idea might be good (or the identified problem important) but the fundamental architecture of the solution isn't viable.<br>

And, of course, there's also "yes, and here's some more ideas".<br>

Then it just drowns in the wave of other patches, contributions, bug reports, ... and will likely just get forgotten soon - possible even by both parties (depending on how much the issue bugs one).<br>
<p>
If I get an answer stating that there's not much time, or that I should look into an approach Foo, I at least now know that someone is on the receiving end. I can then ask when a better time for this would be or even answer that I looked (already or just now) at the other approach Foo, and this may just persuade the other party that I indeed tried to do my homework and not just sending without any research if this is still an issue or no research into what approach should be used to fix it. Thus they may even get more likely to invest some precious and scarce time.<br>
<p>
So often an answer about not having time for now is better than no answer, but as with a lot of things, this isn't binary and cannot be generally said, IMO.<br>

Hm, I'd prefer a "no" which implicitly means that the other person has at least looked at my proposal.<br>
In business, I tend to "say" (=email) "no" quite often, so I personally find not giving or receiving a (negative) answer quite offensive.<br>

I think there is room for differentiation in "yes" too.<br>
<p>
- yes, this patch is good.<br>
- yes, but next time please provide a better change log<br>
- yes, but that particular feature there is a bit ugly.  Can you do something about that?<br>
<p>
I've had that last one from Linus at least twice, and the ugly bit eventually was removed.  One way that Linus built a strong team of maintainers was by accepting imperfect patches - being welcoming and trusting.<br>

I noticed something interesting when reading Postgres's CoC: they mention that, what is, in one culture, the normal way of being polite, is often, in another culture, biting sarcasm, and often what is polite in the second is brusque in the first. As such, well-meaning people interacting for the first time will sometimes offend each other, and it's useful to have a third party to contact when you get upset, who will let the other person know (out of band of the code review) that you got upset and they should make it better. As a side effect, having a trickle of minor problems to resolve is a good way of ensuring that the process is still functional if it's ever really necessary.<br>

      This is far from a US-only issue. For example, have you noticed that the proprietary software world has large numbers of Asian programmers (from India, China, Japan, Korea, etc), percentage-wise far more than almost any FLOSS project?  Did you ever wonder why?  While language is a barrier, a more major factor is that for people of many cultural backgrounds, having your work publicly insulted by a world-famous star developer is an incredibly shameful humiliation and you may never see that person again.  If you want to talk that way on the development lists, it means that you're going to drive away many good people because their temperament, culture, and background means they just can't deal with that kind of environment.  So it's very good that it is being addressed.

Yes, I believe this issue is often ignored, in favour of for lack of a better word "US identity politics", even though the impact is a lot larger than say for example the sensibilities of transgender people or American ideas about "race" (which lumps together over 2 billion people "Asian"). I think in the area of intercultural communication there could probably something be done by the community to foster more understanding and inclusiveness - without creating the often nasty debates about Western politics. <br>

Maybe in the Western world those people take up programming, who are actually interested in programming, so they might do it outside working hours. Maybe in Asia people take up programming because an authority figure tells them to do that, but they have neither the talent or the drive to actually program - and while they might get away with their lack of production in an outsourced proprietary environment, this wouldn't work in a FOSS environment (I mean if they'd be interested in programming at all)?<br>

I can certify from personal experience that a lot of people in the Western world take up programming entirely for the money, with no visible vestige of talent (but often a lot of determination). I find it very unlikely that China, Japan or India are so very different. There are *definitely* a lot of extremely talented people over there.<br>
<p>
(What may be different is the *scale*: I vaguely recall a report from one Indian consultancy that noted that there were some excellent universities teaching software development to a high standard in India... and a lot of really bad degree mills. They suggested that the number of these mills is such that only about 5% of the total output of all these institutions can write even the simplest program (which still means tens to hundreds of thousands of good programmers). However... I can't remember what the report was, where it came from, or how they determined that figure, so it's probably been corrupted into biased nonsense by my memory. It is definitely years out of date.)<br>

Given the reaction, I think perhaps he felt that if it were discussed publicly, the discussion would never end.  There is too much politics-adjacent stuff for the community to come to a simple consensus without being forced to something, I think.  I would also suggest that part of the theory is that potential contributors are being driven away, and so those who are present are those who find the current situation tolerable.  If the goal is in part to fix things that make some people uncomfortable participating, perhaps asking those who are already comfortable what they’d like changed isn’t a good way to do that.<br>
<p>
And now you run in to difficult questions like who is the community for and who should get to make decisions like this.  And then in to the deeper questions about how groups of humans should make choices (and how to get them to make the best choices and whether that goal should override other principles you may hold).<br>

<p>
This is a flawed parallel - in part because the kernel *doesn't* use Stallman's license.  Stallman's license is GPLv3.  We don't use it because we examined it and found that it didn't meet our needs.<br>
<p>
Compare with the CoC, which we examined hastily, "adopted" in a rush, found that it didn't meet our needs and then tried to doctor using an "interpretation" document which is longer than the original.<br>
<p>
When we have differences of opinion with Posix that are strong enough, we tend to ignore Posix and do what we (collectively) think is best.  Does Greg ever say "take it up with the Posix committee" ??<br>

The GPLv2 is also Stallman’s license.  I don’t see the flaw in the parallel.  We’re still taking something from someone we don’t all fully agree with, we’re just not taking another different thing they’ve created as well.<br>
<p>
Having interpretation documents along with specific instantions of rules (or code or law) is not at all uncommon or problematic.  Isn’t that kind of what documentation is?  (This doesn’t mean the CoC is perfect, and its adoption was messy, but another document about it isn’t really a big deal.)<br>
<p>
We don’t take it up with the POSIX committee because we are confident that would be an enormous waste of time.  If POSIX were a responsive, flexible organization that published easily updated and accessible documents, people would be more interested in them, and we might do that.  But they’re a horrifying bureaucracy, so we don’t bother and figure they’ll maybe figure it out later.<br>
<p>
Presumably Greg believes the CoC upstream will be more responsive.  And I’d also bet he wants people to go away, too, at least for a little bit.<br>

Some of us are confident that taking up our issues with the CoC upstream would *also* be an enormous waste of time.<br>
<p>
You can't simultaneously say "upstream's politics are irrelevant, we're just using their document" and "changes to the document need to go through upstream".  The two positions are incompatible.<br>

You take the original document from upstream as a fixed artefact, which can't be altered, and then any necessary revisions or changes happen in a separately maintained repository of explanation, clarification, specialization, exegesis, and case law.

What? We do that all the time. The Austin Group is pretty responsive -- and you'd recognize a great many of the names. To a considerable degree POSIX these days is polishing up and standardizing what Linux does, just as in the past it polished and standardized what other Unixes did (back when they were significant generators of innovation).<br>

So you're going to treat the word "management" the same way?<br>

Writing it as "Code" gives it IMHO a holy code status, which is not something I would want. For instance, when translating it to my language, I try to avoid the English term and prefer the literal translation of the term.<br>

The term 'Code of Conduct' as used in the article is a 'proper noun' in English:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proper%20noun">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proper%20noun</a><br>

Proper nouns are per usual rules of English usage capitalized.   The rules of usage do not depend on the 'holy' status of the term any more than Posix standards do.   In this particular case, capitalization makes the writing clearer and thus serves the purpose of LWN.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I have received reviews that told me in detail what's wrong with a patch, but never indicated how to improve it. That's the single most important point to improve a newbie's experience.</font><br>
<p>
The point is that, when you say, "no, because of this", the patch author will likely try a different approach and submit a version 2. If the author gets it right  the second time, it means twice the work for the maintainer, as he'll need to review the new version too. Unfortunately, when a newbie submits a patch, the second version will very likely require changes, with ends by requiring a few other interactions, until a final version gets ready to merge.<br>
<p>
Usually, it costs much less time for a maintainer to just write himself a patch, specially if he has to "indicate how to improve". On the other hand, providing reviews is actually a mentoring activity. If done well, it may end by getting more developers to the subsystem.<br>
<p>
On a perfect world, where the maintainer has infinite time and patience, he could always provide a "what's wrong/how to fix" feedback, but in practice, after a few rounds, he may accept a sub-optimal solution, an fix it later himself.<br>
<p>
From mentoring PoV, sometimes it could be good to not say "how to fix": it forces the submitter to look deeper in the question. <br>
<p>
I've seen several cases where the solution presented on a next version using a completely different "out of box" approach from what it would be expected, making the code a lot simpler or better than if the maintainer would have provided his opinion about  "how to fix".<br>

<p>
I didn't mean that maintainers should say "how to fix" a submission, but to "indicate how to improve it".<br>
<p>
Say a submitted patch contains a call to a deprecated function named old_func(). A useless review would be 'We don't use old_func() any more.' A useful review would be 'Use new_func() instead.' It tells the submitter to come back with a new version of the patch, points the submitter to the possible improvement, and separates new contributors that are really interested from those that are not. The contributors that you actually want in your project will look up new_func() and learn how to use it. There's no need to explain new_func().<br>
<p>
As a maintainer, you also have to think about how you appear to possible contributors at the technical level. At least if I receive a review that I'd call useless, the maintainer looks careless and uninterested to me. I don't bother spending more time on contributing to that software. Finding new contributors is maybe not much of a problem for the Linux kernel, but it can make a difference for many other projects.<br>

Yeah, I guess so. My point is: if is something obvious like replace deprecated foo() by bar(), it costs nothing for the maintainer to point it, but if it is something non-trivial, just providing a feedback about what's wrong is usually better, as it lets the developer to use his creativity.<br>

That's answer from vger.kernel.org postmaster, David Miller (the same netdev David Miller) about linux-kernel@ mailing list (and vger generally).<br>
<p>
Reason? My MX server was bouncing messages and he didn't like me resubscribing to kernel mailing list<br>
without contacting him first (you need to know that that you shouldn't resubscribe on your own).<br>
<p>
7 years passed and the problem is still there. It doesn't matter if you are (tiny) kernel contributor, with few patches merged for example.<br>
<p>
<p>
So question - will there be a "conduct" for kernel related infrastructure maintainers, too?<br>
<p>
ps. if there are (new/old) vger postmasters willing to help solve this - I'm here<br>

You could probably try approaching the Technical Advisory Board, seeing that they are the ones that should enforce the CoC, maybe they also care about stuff like this.<br>

But yeah, bouncing messages on LKML seem to anger the - still same - postmaster alot.<br>

Many people have corporate email systems that are incompatible with LKML. The most common workaround  is get a 3rd party mail account and use that. Resubscribing with the same mail address is definitely going to upset administrators.<br>

Historically MX servers that cannot deliver mail and instead bounce have been kicked. Why *should* the list be forced to deal with bounced traffic on top of everything else? Many mailing lists, not just LKML, will force unsubscribe an address that bounces mails and I know when I was using a University MX with amateur (i.e. student) management used to get kicked from LKML every few months. I also had to jump through the hoop of getting the list admin to resubscribe after promising that the MX is definitely going to work this time.<br>

<p>
That sounds more like a technical reason than an arbitrary decision. Maintaining a public ML while avoiding (too much) span is a hard task. While I never touched at vger infra, we have a mailman instance at linuxtv.org that has a *lot* less traffic than vger.  After trying a few things, we ended by using a subscribers-only model there, to avoid spam, and to move the main discussion list to vger, with does a lot better job than we used to do.<br>
<p>
From security PoV, commenting about what are the internal security measures is something that usually is not a good idea, as it may end by exposing some possible breach. <br>
<p>
Also, trying to force a magician to reveal his tricks will likely make him annoyed ;-)<br>
<p>
From what I see, blocking an MX server that doesn't behave well and asking people to use some other solution sounds reasonable, specially on a list like LKML where dozens of thousands of people follow and post messages (and its server probably receives a huge amount of spam that got filtered by some magic).<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; will there be a "conduct" for kernel related infrastructure maintainers, too?</font><br>
<p>
Even if there is/will be, a technical issue like that - or a non-disclosure policy about how security is implemented internally - wouldn't fit into a code of conduct.<br>

At the great risk of dragging the author of the document back into the discussion... Remember: my point is that the attributes of the author are not what I am concerned about in this discussion; my concern is with the content of the document.  However, what better reference to answer whether the document is a political document than the author?  Coraline recently tweeted:<br>
<p>

The more I read this discussion the more it seems to me that the comparison to the GPL and RMS is exactly on-target.  Not too many people seem to have a problem with Linux utilizing the GPL as a stand-alone artifact without worrying about the fact that they don't agree with the larger political and social objectives of its author.  It's not news to anyone that a large contingent of Linux folks disagree with RMS on these points.<br>
<p>
How is it that it's problematic to take the CoC at face value based on its actual wording without worrying about the political agenda of its author?<br>
<p>
In an ironic twist I have to wonder if, had Linus's decision come about a few scant weeks later, the Linux team might not have chosen RMS's "Kind Communications Guidelines" <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html</a> instead of the CoC and whether that would have gone over better...<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; However, what better reference to answer whether the document is a political document than the author? Coraline recently tweeted:</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; "Some people are saying that the Contributor Covenant is a political document, and they’re right."</font><br>
<p>
"Political" is very broad and vague so please elaborate (this tweet elaborates even... less).<br>
<p>
Some quotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics</a><br>
- "affairs of the cities" in Greek<br>
- process of making decisions that apply to members of a group<br>
- framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society<br>
<p>
... so from such a very broad perspective yes of course _any_ code of conduct will be "political", just like any other law / regulation / code / discussion about libel, harassment, power, discrimination, bias,...<br>
<p>
It's unfortunate "politics" has come to mean "dysfunctional politics". I suspect Caroline's tweet/troll consciously played on that. Only getting worse with propaganda from cable news and fakebook constantly focusing on the statistically irrelevant worst.<br>

Is this the organization that harassed SFC by trying steal its name? Does that count as a "conduct-related" issue?<br>

I should probably clarify myself here. I think SFLC's behaviour has been unreasonable or unacceptable on multiple occasions, and my feelings about Eben are pretty clear. But I have no concerns about Mishi's involvement in this role.<br>

           </div>
The merge window phase of the kernel development cycle is a hectic time.
Over a period of about two weeks, between 5,000 and 10,000
changesets find their way into the mainline git repository.  Simply
managing that many patches would be hard enough, but the job is made more
complicated by the fact that these changesets are not all independent of
each other.  The
first changes to be merged can change the code base in ways that cause
later patches to fail to apply.  So merge windows have traditionally
required maintainers to rework their queued patches to resolve 
conflicts which arise as other trees are merged.  Given the tight time constraints (patches which aren't ready
when the merge window closes generally sit out until the next cycle
starts), this integration process has been known to put a fair amount of
pressure on subsystem maintainers.
<p>

The other person feeling the stress was Andrew Morton; one of his many jobs
was to bash subsystem trees together in his -mm releases.  That took a lot
of his time and didn't really solve the problem in the end; much of the
work which shows up in -mm isn't necessarily intended for the next
development cycle.  The end result of all this is that each merge window
brought together large amounts of code which had never been integrated
before.
<p>

Back in February, the linux-next tree was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/269120/">announced</a> as a way to help ease
some of these problems.  We are now nearing the end of the first full
development cycle to use linux-next, so it's worth taking a look to see how
it is working out.
<p>

The idea behind this tree is relatively simple.  Linux-next maintainer
Stephen Rothwell keeps a <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git;a=blob;f=Next/Trees;hb=HEAD">list
of trees</a>  (maintained with git or quilt) which
are intended to be merged in the next development cycle.  As of this
writing, that list contains 95 trees, all full of patches aimed at 2.6.27.
Once a day, Stephen goes through the process of applying these trees to the
mainline, one at a time.  With each merge, he looks for merge conflicts and
build failures.  The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/268881/">original
plan for linux-next</a> stated that trees causing conflicts or build
failures would simply be dropped.  In reality, so far, Stephen usually
takes the time to figure out the problem; he'll then fix up or drop an
individual patch to make everything fit again.
<p>
When this process is done, he releases the result as the linux-next tree
for the day.  Others then grab it and perform build testing on it; some
people even boot and run the daily linux-next releases.  All this results
in a steady stream of problem reports, small fixes, patches moving from one
tree to another, and so on - various bits of integration work required to
make all of the pieces fit together nicely.
<p>

There is an interesting sort of implicit hierarchy in the ordering of the
trees.  Subsystem trees which are merged early in the process are less
likely to run into conflicts than those which come later.  When two trees
do come into conflict, it's the owner of the later tree - the one which
actually shows the conflict - who feels the most pressure to fix things
up.  The history so far, though, shows that there has been very little in
the way of finger-pointing when conflicts arise, as they do almost every
day.  All of the developers understand that they are working on the same
kernel, and they share a common interest in solving problems. 
<p>

One aspect of
this whole system remains untested, though: the movement of patches from
linux-next into the mainline.
<span class="invisible"> END QUOTE]</span>
</span>


So, thus far, linux-next appears to be functioning as intended.  It is
serving as an integration point for the next kernel and helping to get
many of the merging problems out of the way ahead of time.  One aspect of
this whole system remains untested, though: the movement of patches from
linux-next into the mainline.  As things stand now, there is no automatic
movement between the trees; instead, maintainers will send their pull
requests directly to Linus as always.  If Linus refuses to merge certain
trees, or if he merges them in an order different from their ordering in
linux-next, integration problems could return.  In the end, it seems like
linux-next will have to drive the final integration process more than is
anticipated now, but it will probably take a few development cycles to
figure out how to make it all work.
<p>

Meanwhile, anybody who is interested in 2.6.27 can, to a great extent, run
it now by grabbing linux-next.  This tree has clarified one aspect of the
development process: the 2-3&nbsp;month "development cycle" run by Linus
is, in fact, just the tip of the kernel development iceberg.  It is the
final integration and stabilization stage.  Linux-next nearly doubles the
length of the visible development cycle by assembling the next kernel long
before Linus starts working on it.  And even linux-next only comes into
play toward the end of a patch's life.
<p>

In the past, Linus has pointedly worked to avoid overlapping the
development and stabilization phases of the development cycle.  There was
no development tree at all for almost a year while 2.4 was beaten into
reasonable shape.  This separation was maintained out of a simple fear that
an open development tree would distract developers from the more important
task of finding and fixing bugs in the current stable release.
<p>

That separation is a thing of the past now; there are literally dozens of
development trees which are open for business at all times.  That can only
be worrisome to those who are concerned about the quality of kernel
releases; why should developers concern themselves with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287055/">2.6.26 bugs</a> when 2.6.27 is being
assembled and 2.6.28 is already on the radar?  Whether such concerns are
valid is likely to be a matter of ongoing debate.
<p>

Meanwhile, however, linux-next appears to have settled in as a long-term
feature of the kernel development landscape.  It is serving its purpose as
a place to find and resolve integration problems; it has also had the
effect of taking much of that integration work off of Andrew Morton's
shoulders.  And that, in turn, should free him to spend more time trying to
get developers to fix all those bugs.
<p>

A thing that would be interesting Jonathan, is a graph over the number of changesets that have
gone into linux-next over time, just like you and Greg have been doing graphs over the number
changesets that have gone into linus-2.6.

Developers need to worry about 2.6.26 bugs, presumably, because Linus won't merge your 2.6.27
changes if you didn't fix problems with your 2.6.26 changes in a timely fashion. And your
later work will probably be particularly messed up if Linus gets fed up and reverts some of
the things you did for 2.6.26 because they had problems you weren't taking care of.

I don't think there's really much risk of developers ignoring bugs (that get Linus or Andrew's
attention, anyway) in favor of working on their next thing, since their reputations are on the
line. The more rational fear is that developers won't test 2.6.26, and so bugs won't get
turned up. But I don't think that actually matters too much: I expect that people will develop
against the currently-stabilizing Linus version, and therefore hit other people's bugs, and
people don't hit their own bugs anyway (at least, those that survive to get merged).

One thing that I think would have traditionally been a problem but shouldn't be an issue with
git is the difficulty of preparing a bugfix patch for 2.6.26 when you've been working on a
post-2.6.27 feature. But that's a command or two of setup these days.

Instead of opening the merge window and making it a free-for-all in a short 2-week period,
what if the merge window rotated among the different subsystems?

E.g. for the next N weeks only accept changes to subsystem A
for the next M weeks, only subsystem B
etc...

Wouldn't that help migrate the pain?

Of course different subsystems would clamor over what the ordering and durations should be...

And once we go full-circle and end up back at the first subsystem we bump a version number
somewhere and call that a release!

That doesn't work when major changes to two subsystems are coupled (say, a 
block layer change that necessitates changes to the scsi midlayer). I 
anticipate vast pointless bickering over what precisely constitutes a 
subsystem if this were done (plus a lot of unnecessary serialization of 
work).

The kernel development community talks often about subsystems and subsystem
maintainers, but it is less than entirely clear about what a "subsystem" is in
the first place.  People wanting to understand how kernel development works
could benefit from a clearer idea of what actually comprises a subsystem
within the kernel.  In an attempt to better understand how kernel
development works, Pia Eichinger (and her colleagues
Ralf Ramsauer, Stefanie Scherzinger, and Wolfgang Maurer)
spent a lot of time looking
for the actual boundaries; Eichinger presented that work at the 2021
linux.conf.au online gathering.
<p>
This work was undertaken to develop a more formalized model of how kernel
development works.  With such an understanding, it is hoped, ways can be
found to make the process work better and to provide new tools.  The
researchers have a particular interest in safety-critical deployments of
Linux.  Safety-critical environments are highly sensitive; working software
can make a life-or-death difference there.  So safety-critical developers
have to ensure software quality by any means available.
<p>
One such means is to take a close look at the development process, on the
reasonable assumption that the process impacts the quality of the final
result.  Assuming that the process itself makes sense, a project that
adheres more closely to its defined process should 

<a href="/Articles/844547/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2021/lca/PiaEichinger-sm.png" alt="[Pia Eichinger]"
title="Pia Eichinger" class="rthumb"></a>

produce higher-quality software.  So if it can be proved that a project's
developers strictly comply with their development process, the level of
assurance is higher and certification — generally necessary for
safety-critical systems — is easier to achieve.
<p>
The Linux kernel presents some major challenges when it comes to
certification due to its open development process.  Nobody documents the
process or the degree to which it is adhered to.  But, she said, with a bit
of data mining, much of that information can be recovered after the fact.
Her focus is on 
patch integration in particular and whether patches are being merged by the
appropriate subsystem maintainers.  If patches are taking "strange paths",
that is a sign that the process is not being followed.
<p>
Eichinger ran into a little problem on the path to that goal, though: where
can one find the subsystem hierarchy that defines this process?  Where are
the documents describing these subsystems; more to the point, what
<i>is</i> a subsystem, exactly?  It may seem like a trivial question, she
said; that is what the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file is for.  But it is not
that easy; as was covered in <a href="/Articles/842415/">this article</a>
(which she cited during the talk), the information in this file is neither
complete nor 100% accurate.
<p>
First of all, many kernel subsystems do not appear in <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>
at all.  But the picture is less than clear even for those that are
present.  Consider, for example, the "media subsystem"; there is no entry
for it.  There are, however, over 100 <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> entries with
"media" in the name somewhere.  Which of those is the true media subsystem?
The answer is not clear for somebody who is not closely familiar with the
kernel community.
<p>
Eichinger and company needed a definition of a "subsystem", so they made
their own.  Entries in the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file do not clearly
describe subsystems, so they were deemed instead to be
"sections" that describe some part of the kernel code base.  Many of these
sections share files with each other; those were designated as "thematically
related".  By finding and grouping clusters of related sections, the
kernel's true subsystems could be found.
<p>
To do so, she processed all of the section entries and plotted them on an
undirected graph, where the sections themselves were the vertices and
shared lines of code make up the edges.  The initial graph looked like
this (from <a href="/images/conf/2021/lca/eichinger-lca.pdf">Eichinger's slides
[PDF]</a>):
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2021/lca/full-graph.png" alt="[Subsystem graph]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
That was, she allowed, a bit messy.  To try to create something more
useful, she cut the graph down to the largest 20% of the sections in the
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file.  The result for the aforementioned media
subsystem looked like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2021/lca/media-subsystem.png" alt="[media subsystem
graph]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
Therein one sees a number of sections for specific drivers, including a
sizeable sub-cluster in the staging directory and a small blob in
the Android drivers.  The section that ties it
all together is "media input infrastructure" — the actual media subsystem.
<p>
The picture for the direct rendering (DRM) subsystem looks a little
different:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2021/lca/drm-subsystem.png" alt="[DRM subsystem
graph]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
This subsystem appears as a large collection of related small clusters,
with a lot of overlap between them.  She described this organization as
"non-conforming" with the hierarchical subsystem model; it seems likely
that what is actually seen here is the distributed, group-maintainer model
used by the DRM developers.
<p>
At this point, she has some sort of definition of subsystems, twelve of
which were identified at the top level.  Those twelve were the Arm
architecture, drivers, crypto, USB, DRM, networking, media, documentation,
sound, SCSI, more Arm stuff (OMAP architecture code, for example), and
Infiniband.  Along with that, she has a tool
that can automate this sort of subsystem detection.  It is, she said, "just
scratching the surface" of the problem, but it is a start.
<p>
There are a number of ways this work could go in the future.  One would be
to examine historical kernel releases to build a history of how kernel
subsystems have evolved over time.  This model can also be used, of course,
for the original purpose of determining how well the actual kernel patch
flow conforms to the maintainer model.  There may be scope for applying
this technique to other projects as well.

I think the drm picture would look a lot tidier if in addition to just linking nodes using shared files, we&#x27;d group the ones in the same git repo (that&#x27;s also in MAINTAINERS) together. Most of the links across the entire subsystem should then end up within such a git repo bubble. That should also help find a bunch of things in other parts of the tree which are closely related to the drm subsystem.<br>
<p>
Which I guess is just another way to state that the graph does indeed not capture the group maintainership nature of how most things are done in drm.<br>

It&#x27;s a cultural stereotype that the Germans are obsessed with order and organization, and there is the saying that all open source projects need at least one German to keep any order. In Geert Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions surveys this is confirmed in an high above average score on the &quot;long term orientation&quot; factor, even as compared to neighbouring countries.<br>
<p>
Maybe that characteristic comes with a bit of compulsive interest in process and bureaucracy.<br>
<p>
The other factor I percieve in this is the German car industry - particularly BMW - which is strongly pushing the agenda to use Linux in mission-critical realtime systems, such as self-driving vehicles. As the ISO certification for mission-critical systems require formal process this research becomes a means to an end.<br>
<p>
These observations made it easier for me to understand this research in context. (I might be wrong.)<br>

Sorry, does this follow at all? It doesn&#x27;t seem to do so to me. This is only the case if we know that the defined process in question is a local or global maximum in terms of the process producing high-quality software. Just looking at an existing process and formalizing it does not imply in any way that sticking to that formal model will generate higher-quality software, just that it&#x27;s sticking closely to the model that the software&#x27;s development process was already following: if that process was bad, following a formal model of it will produce bad software. This seems likely to me to (at best) be a wash in terms of quality, on the average.<br>

<p>
Yes I found this a bit puzzling as well. I think the unstated assumption is that the development process is thought to be a good one, therefore following it properly is also a good thing. Given two projects A and B which both follow development process Z, then the quality of A will be &quot;better&quot; than B if A follows the process strictly whereas B only follows it haphazardly. In this situation  &quot;better&quot; is not quite true, it&#x27;s more like the quality of A would be steadier and therefore more reliable than B&#x27;s quality, which I think intuitively makes sense.<br>
<p>
I can see how this might make sense in a certification context where if the dev process is certified but the project doesn&#x27;t really follow it, then approving the process is useless. It sounds a bit like an audit for ISO 9001 compliance.<br>

As it is rather difficult to objectively measure _quality_, consistency is used instead, with process being the primary way that consistency is maintained.   But like all metrics, it ends up becoming what things are optimized for, even at the expense of actual &quot;quality&quot;.<br>

It occurs to me that this kind of analysis may be useful in mapping other large distributed communities such as debian, perhaps to identify sub-teams or find small teams that would work more efficiently together. I had a very quick look at the repo and it seems to track based on patches to the mailing list, so I&#x27;m not sure that would identify cross-package work even if using something like snapshot.debian.org as the data source.<br>

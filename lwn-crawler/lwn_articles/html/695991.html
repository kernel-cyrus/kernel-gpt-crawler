<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 3, 2016</br>

<p>
The kernel often copies data from and to user space, which makes
<tt>copy_to_user()</tt> and <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> (and friends) rather
frequently 
used kernel functions.  But if the kernel can be tricked into copying too
much data in either direction, security vulnerabilities can be the result.
Long ago, grsecurity added the PAX_USERCOPY feature (created by the PaX
team) to harden those calls, so that even poorly written code elsewhere in
the kernel cannot truly copy more than it should. Code based on
PAX_USERCOPY is now being proposed for inclusion into the mainline kernel.
</p>

<p>
Kees Cook <a href="/Articles/693745/">posted</a> the first version of his
"hardened usercopy" patches in early July.  The
patches are 
based on some earlier work that Casey Schaufler had done to port the
PAX_USERCOPY feature from 
grsecurity to the mainline.  Essentially, it tries to ensure that address ranges
used to copy data to and from user space are valid.  Cook is also working on
patches for two other parts of the
PAX_USERCOPY feature; this piece is configured into the kernel with the
<tt>CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY</tt> option.  
</p>

<p>
The main problems that can result from an errant user-space copy are either
that too much data is copied to user space, resulting in leaking the
contents of kernel
memory, or that too much data is copied from user space, which can
overwrite kernel memory.  If an attacker can influence the allocation of
objects on the kernel's heap and then overwrite some of those objects, they
may be able to escalate privileges, run 
arbitrary code, or crash the kernel.  Information leaks are generally less
dangerous, but the kernel does have critical data (e.g. keys) that could be
exposed.  Beyond that, determining the layout of kernel memory by way of an
information leak can also provide information needed to exploit other
kernel flaws.
</p>

<p>
The patches add several tests of the arguments to the
<tt>copy_*_user()</tt> functions, which have the following prototypes:

<pre>
    long copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user * from, unsigned long n);
    long copy_to_user(void __user *to, const void *from, unsigned long n);
</pre>

Each call involves a user-space pointer and a kernel-space pointer; the
user-space pointers are already checked in current kernels, so the patches
only add tests for the kernel-space pointers.
Those tests ensure that the address range doesn't wrap past the end of memory,
that the kernel-space pointer is not null, and that it does not point to a
zero-length <tt>kmalloc()</tt> allocation 
(i.e. <tt>ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR()</tt> is false).
Also, if
the address range overlaps 
the kernel text (code) segment, it is rejected.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, if the kernel-space address points into an object that has
been allocated 
from the slab allocator, the patches ensure that what is being copied fits
within the size of the object allocated.
This check is performed by calling <tt>PageSlab()</tt> on the kernel
address to see if it lies within 
a page that is handled
by the slab 
allocator; it then calls an allocator-specific
routine to determine whether the amount of data to be copied is fully
within an allocated object.  If the address range is not handled by the
slab allocator, the patches will test that it is either within a single or
compound page and that it does not span independently allocated pages.

<p>
In addition, 
for copies involving the stack, the copied range must fit within the current
process's stack.  If there is architecture support for identifying stack
frames, the copied range must fit within a single frame.
</p>

<p>
In all cases, an address range that fails the tests will generate a log
message with the pertinent information.  It will also call <tt>BUG()</tt>
to generate a kernel oops and kill the current process (i.e. the one that
was trying to exploit a kernel hole of some kind).

<p>
The patch set is broken up into three logical chunks: the main patch that
adds the tests, patches that enable the feature for specific
architectures (originally, x86, arm, arm64, ia64, powerpc, and sparc, with
s390 added in a more recent patch set), and two patches that add
heap-checking support for the SLAB  
and SLUB allocators.  Cook noted that the SLOB allocator support in
grsecurity "<q>seems entirely broken</q>", so he focused on testing
SLAB and SLUB.  In addition, stack frame checking has only been implemented
for x86.
</p>

<p>
Cook said that he "<q>couldn't detect a measurable performance change
with these features enabled</q>", when running tests like kernel builds
and <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/hackbench.8.html">hackbench</a>.  That suggested that the feature could be turned on by
default at some point, though it is turned off by default for now.  Ingo
Molnar <a href="/Articles/696051/">suggested</a> running a
system-call-heavy workload to see if that had any measurable performance
degradation, as he would also like to see the feature on by default.  Linus
Torvalds <a href="/Articles/696052/">said</a> that a
<tt>stat()</tt>-heavy workload (e.g. something like <tt>git&nbsp;diff</tt>)
would be one way to test it, but indicated that he thought the checks would
not be all that onerous.
</p>

<p>
Andy Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/696055/">wondered</a> if some of the
infrastructure to validate the objects being copied should be given a
different name, since it might be extended to more than just "usercopy"
down the road.  That set off a bit of a squabble between Molnar and PaX
Team about the feature, threat models, and "bikeshedding".  Cook, however,
successfully <a href="/Articles/696056/">tamped down</a> the flickering
flames:
<div class="BigQuote">
There's a long history of misunderstanding and miscommunication
(intentional or otherwise) by everyone on these topics. I'd love it if
we can just side-step all of it, and try to stick as closely to the
technical discussions as possible. Everyone involved in these
discussions wants better security, even if we go about it in different
ways. If anyone finds themselves feeling insulted, just try to let it
go, and focus on the places where we can find productive common
ground, remembering that any fighting just distracts from the more
important issues at hand.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The patch set is in its <a href="/Articles/696075/">fourth revision</a> at
this point; Cook has <a href="/Articles/696076/">requested</a> that it be
pulled for 4.8.  In the review process, some bugs have been fixed (notably
some arm64 fixes and additions from Laura Abbott) and changes made, but no
fundamental disagreement with the feature has emerged.  As of this writing,
the patches have not been pulled, but there were some prerequisites so it
may simply be that Torvalds just hasn't gotten to it yet.  But, if not for 4.8,
it seems likely that we will see the feature appear in the mainline fairly
soon.

<h1>Merging GFS2</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted September 7, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Andrew Morton has stated that the OCFS2 cluster filesystem is likely to be
merged for 2.6.14.  OCFS2 is not the only such filesystem under
development, however, and the developers behind the GFS2 filesystem are <a
href="/Articles/150653/">wondering</a> when it, too, might be merged - into -mm,
at least.  Much work has been done on GFS to address <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/147043/">concerns</a> which have
been raised previously; the developers think that it is getting close to
ready for wider exposure.  The resulting discussion raised a couple of
interesting questions about the kernel development process.
<p>

The first one was <a href="/Articles/150654/">asked</a> by Andrew Morton:
"why?".  Given that OCFS2 is going in, does the kernel really need another
clustered filesystem?  What, in particular, does GFS bring that OCFS2
lacks?  The answers took two forms: (1)&nbsp;Linux has traditionally hosted
a large variety of filesystems, and (2)&nbsp;since cluster filesystems are
relatively new, users should be able to try both and see which one
works better for them.  David Teigland also posted <a
href="/Articles/150655/">a list of GFS features</a>.
<p>

GFS will probably win this argument; there is a clear user community, and
filesystems tend not to have any impact on the rest of the kernel.  But,
still, some developers are starting to wonder; consider, for example, <a
href="/Articles/150657/">this message</a> from Suparna Bhattacharya:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And herein lies the issue where I tend to agree with Andrew on --
	its really nice to have multiple filesystems innovating freely in
	their niches and eventually proving themselves in practice, without
	being bogged down by legacy etc. But at the same time, is there
	enough thought and discussion about where the
	fragmentation/diversification is really warranted, vs improving
	what is already there, or say incorporating the best of one into
	another, maybe over a period of time?
</div>
<p>
The other issue which came up was the creation of a user-space API for the
distributed lock manager (DLM) used by GFS.  If nothing else, the two
cluster filesystem should have a common API so that applications can be
written for either one.  One option for this API might be "dlmfs", a
virtual filesystem used with OCFS2.  The dlmfs approach allows normal
filesystem operations to be used for lock management tasks; even shell
scripts can perform locking.  Concerns with dlmfs include relatively slow
performance and <a href="/Articles/150660/">a certain unease</a> with
aspects of the interface:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Actually I think it's rather sick.  Taking O_NONBLOCK and making it
	a lock-manager trylock because they're
	kinda-sorta-similar-sounding?  Spare me.  O_NONBLOCK means "open
	this file in nonblocking mode", not "attempt to acquire a clustered
	filesystem lock".  Not even close.
</div>
<p>
(Andrew Morton).
<p>
  It is not clear that better alternatives exist, however.
One could implement it all with a big set of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls, but
nobody really wants to do that.  Another approach would be to create a new
set of system calls specifically for lock management.  Some have argued in
favor of system calls, but others, such as Alan Cox, are <a
href="/Articles/150663/">strongly opposed</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Every so often someone decides that a deeply un-unix interface with
	new syscalls is a good idea. Every time history proves them totally
	bonkers.  There are cases for new system calls but this doesn't
	seem one of them.
</div>
<p>
Alan lists a number of reasons why a file descriptor-based approach makes
sense for this sort of operation - they mostly come down to well-understood
semantics and the fact that many things just work.
<p>

This is clearly a discussion which could go on for some time.  Daniel
Phillips <a href="/Articles/150665/">points out</a> that this is not
necessarily a problem.  There are currently no user-space users of any DLM
API beyond a few filesystem management tools, so there is no great hurry to
merge any API.  The cluster filesystems could go in without any user-space
DLM interface at all while the developers figure out what that interface
should be.  And, says Daniel, perhaps there should not be one at all.
Despite the perceived elegance of having a single lock manager on the
system, having user space rely upon its own, user-space DLM is a workable
solution which could simplify the kernel side of things.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      As the only Lustre user in the universe[1], I certainly wish I sometimes saw Lustre come up in these discussions.  Unlike OCFS2, GFS2, and StorNext, Lustre *really* *is* *different*.  It's not shared storage!  It's distributed storage!  This is very different!<br>
<p>
[1] This is untrue.  Lustre is actually used by a secret cabal of systems admins in governments and shady agencies worldwide who are in control of 92% of the planet's supercomputing power.  I'm just the only Lustre user in LWN :)<br>

      Given that their business model is based on selling access to the current version in the guise of a support contract, I can't see why they'd bother.<br>
<p>
They did try to get some of their VFS changes merged a while back - I seem to recall that some stuff that other in-tree filesystems were able to use was accepted (intents?), but nothing Lustre-specific.<br>

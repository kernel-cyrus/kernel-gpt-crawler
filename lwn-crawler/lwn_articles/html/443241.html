The control group mechanism allows an administrator to group processes
together and apply any of a number of resource usage policies to them.  The
feature has existed for some time, but only recently have we seen
significant use of it.  Control groups are now the basis for per-group CPU
scheduling (including the automatic per-session group scheduling that was
merged for 2.6.38), process management in systemd, and more.  This feature
is clearly useful, but it also has a bad reputation among many kernel
developers who often are heard to mutter that they would like to yank
control groups out of the kernel altogether.  In the real world, removing
control groups is an increasingly difficult thing to do, so it makes sense
to consider the alternative: fixing them.
<p>
One of the complaints about control groups is that they have been "bolted
on" to existing kernel mechanisms rather than properly integrated into
those mechanisms.  Given the relatively late arrival of control groups,
that is, perhaps, not a surprising outcome.  When attaching a significant
new feature to long-established core kernel code, it is natural to try to
keep to the side and minimize the intrusion on the existing code.  But
bolting code onto the side is not always the way toward an optimal solution
which can be maintained over the long term.  Some recent work with the memory
controller highlights this problem - and points toward an improvement
of the situation.
<p>
The system memory map consists of one <tt>struct page</tt> for each
physical page in the system; it can be thought of as an extensive array of
structures matching the array of pages:
<p>
<blockquote>

width=459 height=30>
</blockquote>
<p>
The kernel maintains a global least-recently-used (LRU) list to track
active pages.  Newly-activated pages are placed at the end of the list;
when it is time to reclaim pages, the pages at the head of the list will be
examined first.  The structure looks something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/memcg/memcg2.png" alt="[Active LRU]"
width=459 height=74>
</blockquote>
<p>
Much of the tricky code in the memory management subsystem has to do with
how pages are placed in - and moved within - this list.
Of course, the situation is a little more complicated than that.  The
kernel actually maintains two LRU lists; the second one holds "inactive"
pages which have been unmapped, but which still exist in the system:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/memcg/memcg3.png" alt="[Two LRUs]"
width=459 height=102>
</blockquote>
<p>
The kernel will move pages from the active to the inactive list if it
thinks they may not be needed in the near future.
Pages in the inactive LRU can be moved quickly back to the active list if
some process tries to access them.  The inactive list can be thought of as
a sort of probationary area for pages that the system is considering
reclaiming soon.
<p>
Of course, the situation is still more complicated than that.  Current kernels
actually maintain <i>five</i> LRU lists.  There are separate active and
inactive lists for anonymous pages - reclaim policy for those pages is
different, and, if the system is running without swap, they may not be
reclaimable at all.  There is also a list for pages which are known not to
be reclaimable - pages which have been locked into memory, for example.
Oh, and it's only fair to say that one set of those lists exists for each memory
zone.  Despite the proliferation of lists, this set, as a whole, is called
the "global LRU."
<p>
Creating a diagram with all these lists would overtax your editor's rather
inadequate drawing skills, though, so envisioning that structure is left as
an exercise for the reader.  
<p>
The memory controller adds another level of complexity as the result of
its need to be able to reclaim pages belonging to specific control groups.
The controller needs to track more information for each page, including a
simple pointer associating each page with the memory control group it is
charged to.  Adding that information to <tt>struct page</tt> was not really
an option; that structure is already packed tightly and there is little
interest in making it larger.  So the memory controller adds a new
<tt>page_cgroup</tt> structure for each page; it has, in essence, created a
new, shadow memory map:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/memcg/memcg4.png" alt="[The shadow page map]"
width=459 height=250>
</blockquote>
<p>
When memory control groups are active, there is another complete set of LRU
lists maintained for each group.  The <tt>list_head</tt> structures needed
to maintain these lists are kept in the <tt>page_cgroup</tt> structure.
What results is a messy structure along these lines:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/memcg/memcg5.png" alt="[Per-memcg LRUs]"
width=459 height=250>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Once again, the situation is rather more complicated than has been shown
here; among other things, there is a series of intervening structures
between <tt>struct mem_cgroup</tt> and the LRU lists.)
<p>
There are a number of disadvantages to this sort of arrangement.  Global
reclaim uses the global LRU as always, so it operates in complete ignorance
of control groups.  It will reclaim pages regardless of whether those pages
belong to groups which are over their limits or not.  Per-control-group
reclaim, instead, can only work with one group at a time; as a result, it
tends to hammer certain groups while leaving others untouched.   The
multiple LRU lists are not just complex, they are also expensive.  A
<tt>list_head</tt> structure is 16&nbsp;bytes on a 64-bit system.  If that
system has 4GB of memory, it has 1,000,000 pages, so 16&nbsp;million bytes
are dedicated just to the infrastructure for the per-group LRU lists.
<p>
This is the kind of situation that kernel developers are referring to
when they say that control groups have been "bolted onto" the rest of the
kernel.  This structure was an effective way to learn about the memory
controller problem space and demonstrate a solution, but there is clearly
room for improvement here.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/442615/">memcg naturalization patches</a> from
Johannes Weiner represent an attempt to create that improvement by better
integrating the memory controller with the rest of the virtual memory
subsystem.  At the core of this work is the elimination of the duplicated
LRU lists.  In particular, with this patch set, the global LRU no longer
exists - all pages exist on exactly one per-group LRU list.  Pages which
have not been charged to a specific control group go onto the LRU list for
the "root" group at the top of the hierarchy.  In essence, per-group
reclaim takes over the older global reclaim code; even a system with
control groups disabled is treated like a system with exactly one control
group containing all running processes.
<p>
Algorithms for memory reclaim necessarily change in this environment.  The
core algorithm now performs a depth-first traversal through the control
group hierarchy, trying to reclaim some pages from each.  There is no
global aging of pages; each group has its oldest pages considered for
reclaim regardless of what's happening in the other groups.  Each group's
hard and soft limits are considered, of course, when setting reclaim
targets.  The end result is that global reclaim naturally spreads the pain
across all control groups, implementing each group's policy in the
process.  The implementation of control group soft limits has been
integrated with this mechanism, so now soft limit enforcement is spread
more fairly across all control groups in the system.
<p>
Johannes's patch improves the situation while shrinking the code by over
400 lines; it also gets rid of the memory cost of the duplicated LRU lists.
On the down side, it makes some fundamental changes to the kernel's memory
reclaim algorithms and heuristics; such changes can cause surprising
regressions on specific workloads and, thus, tend to need a lot of scrutiny
and testing.  Absent any such surprises, this early-stage patch set looks
like a promising step toward the goal of turning control groups into a
proper kernel feature.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

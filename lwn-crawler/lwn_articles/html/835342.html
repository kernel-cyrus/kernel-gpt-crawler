Address-space isolation is the technique of removing a range of memory from
one or more address spaces as a way of preventing accidental or malicious
access to that memory.  Since the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre
vulnerabilities, the kernel has used <a href="/Articles/741878/">one form
of address-space isolation</a> to make kernel memory completely
inaccessible to user-space processes, for example.  There has been a steady
level of interest in using similar techniques to protect memory in other
contexts; two patches implementing new isolation mechanisms are getting
closer to being ready for merging into the mainline kernel.
<p>
<h4><tt>memfd_secret()</tt></h4>
<p>
The first of these is the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201026083752.13267-1-rppt@kernel.org/"><tt>memfd_secret()</tt></a>
patch set from Mike Rapoport, which has been <a
href="/Articles/812325/">covered here before</a>, so this overview will be
relatively brief; see that article for more background.  The purpose 
of this work is to allow a user-space process to create a "secret" memory area
that is as inaccessible as possible outside of the process.  Intended users
include cryptographic libraries, which can use a secret area to hold
cryptographic keys and keep them safe from prying eyes.
<p>
This functionality has, in recent revisions of the patch set, been moved
into a separate system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int memfd_secret(unsigned long flags);
</pre>
<p>
The return value will be a file descriptor that can then be passed to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
to map an actual range of memory.  For the most part, that memory will look
(to the mapping process) like any other memory area, but there will be a
couple of differences:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Pages of memory in this range will be removed from the kernel's direct
     map â€” the portion of the address space that lets the kernel access
     (almost) any physical page in the system.  This makes it much harder
     for the kernel to access this memory, either intentionally or by way
     of an exploit.
<li> If <tt>flags</tt> includes <tt>SECRETMEM_UNCACHED</tt>, then the
     memory will be mapped uncached if the underlying architecture supports
     it.  Uncached memory will be far slower to access, but it is also
     immune to disclosure via many speculative-execution vulnerabilities.
</ul>
<p>
Memory in a secret area is locked into RAM and unable to be swapped.  As
such, it is counted against the owning process's locked-memory limit.
<p>
One ongoing problem with features like this is that removal of pages from
the kernel's direct map is an expensive operation.  The direct map uses
huge pages, minimizing its impact on the system's translation lookaside
buffer (TLB).  Removing random pages from the map breaks up those huge
pages, significantly increasing TLB pressure.  In order to minimize this
impact, the <tt>memfd_secret()</tt> patch set maintains a separate cache of
physically contiguous pages to use for this purpose.
<p>
The rate of change for this patch set has been slowing for some time, so it
may be close to being ready for inclusion.  One never knows for sure
with memory-management patches, though, until the patches are actually
applied.
<p>
<h4>KVM protected memory</h4>
<p>
While memory-disclosure vulnerabilities are unwanted on any system, the
stakes are often higher on systems that are running virtualized guests.

Such machines may be running workloads from unrelated groups that are
unwilling to share their secrets with each other in ordinary circumstances;
the possibility of sharing a physical system with a guest that is under the
control of an attacker makes memory protection an even more urgent
problem. 

As a way of hardening
these systems, CPU vendors have been adding memory-encryption mechanisms
that make guest memory inaccessible to the kernel and to other guests.
These features have their own cost, though, and support in hardware is far
from universal at this point.
<p>
Kirill Shutemov has drawn an interesting conclusion from these
technologies, though: the fact that systems using them still work means
that access to that memory from the kernel or the hypervisor
is not actually needed most of the time.  So he has put together <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201020061859.18385-1-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com/">a
patch set</a> that takes a fully software-based approach.  Rather than
encrypt guest memory, systems running this code just unmap it.  Using this
feature requires support on the part of both the kernel and the guest.
<p>
Specifically, a KVM hypercall is added that allows guests to request that
their memory be made inaccessible.  The host kernel will respond 
 by removing any memory allocated to the guest from the direct
map, taking away its own ability to access that memory.  In user space the
approach is a bit different: any memory belonging to the guest remains
mapped but is marked
with <tt>PROT_NONE</tt> protections, again making it inaccessible.  This
will affect processes like the QEMU emulator, which will lose direct access
to guest memory.  The lack of mappings will naturally impede attacks coming
from other guests as well.  Within the guest, the guest kernel controls memory
permissions as usual.
<p>
The resulting isolation protects guest memory from unwanted access by way
of vulnerabilities 
in components like the kernel or QEMU.  It is not a complete protection,
though; if the host kernel is compromised to the level of arbitrary code
execution, it can remap the pages and pillage them at leisure.  For the
wide range of vulnerabilities that depend on getting the kernel to access a
stray pointer â€” or speculative-execution vulnerabilities â€” though, this
unmapping should significantly raise the bar for any exploit attempt.
<p>
Of course, there are times when the kernel must access memory within guests
to perform normal kernel functions.  A second hypercall has been added for
guests to indicate which memory they need to open up to the host kernel;
those ranges will be mapped back into the host kernel's address space.  DMA
buffers for virtualized devices are one example of the type of memory that
a guest would want to share with the host kernel in this way.
<p>
This work looks interesting, but there are a number of loose ends that need
to be tied down before it can be considered ready.  Unlike
<tt>memfd_secret()</tt>, this work has no mechanism for avoiding
direct-map fragmentation as pages are removed; since the amount of memory
involved is rather larger in this case, the fragmentation problems are
likely to be that much more severe.  Unmapped guest memory cannot be migrated,
which defeats the kernel's mechanisms for defragmenting memory.  That is
likely to cause all sorts of problems over time; Shutemov has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201020125504.xadmnhpf3pu4uva7@black.fi.intel.com/">acknowledged</a>
that this problem will need to be fixed before the patches can be merged.
It is also currently not possible to reboot a guest with protected memory;
Shutemov has suggested that this case could just be declared "unsupported",
an idea that has already <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87ft6949x8.fsf@vitty.brq.redhat.com/">drawn
complaints</a> in the discussion.
<p>
The length of this list of issues implies that the KVM protected memory
work is not 
something that will be seen in the mainline kernel in the near future.
Both of these patch sets are a likely indicator of the direction things are
going, though.  Sharing as much as possible may improve performance, but it
seems increasingly clear that the associated security problems are anything
but easy to address.  Separating address spaces as much as possible looks
like a relatively straightforward way to sidestep many of those problems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

why is memfd_secret another syscall? doesn&#x27;t it make much more sense as a flag to memfd_create?<br>

Secretmem prevents ptrace access so debuggers and core dumping won&#x27;t be able to read these pages. As for criu, in theory it could read secretmem mappings, but this would reduce the security benefits of using secretmem.<br>

<p>
*All* ptrace access, or just PTRACE_PEEKDATA? If it&#x27;s the latter then ptrace could still be used to access the &quot;secret&quot; memory by first injecting code into the process to copy the data elsewhere.<br>
<p>
I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that comfortable with the idea of handing processes rootkit-like tools to hide the contents of their memory from the system administrator, though I suppose the enforcement aspects could be patched out of the kernel easily enough without affecting the userspace ABI. This seems like something that could benefit malware (including, but not limited to, DRM) at least as much as security software.<br>

<p>
The idea behind the Linux Security Module (LSM) interface was initially
discussed as part of the "NSA Linux" session at the <a
href="http://lwn.net/2001/features/KernelSummit/">first  
Kernel Summit</a> back in 2001.  The intent was to avoid wiring a particular
security solution into the kernel; instead, multiple approaches to security
could be built on top of
a common kernel API.  Originally, as the name implies, the solutions
were built as loadable kernel modules, but eventually the "M" in LSM became
just a historical artifact as the API was no longer exported
to modules (essentially requiring security "modules" to be statically
linked into the kernel).  But it's possible that may all change again
with a recent <a href="/Articles/525729/">patch to bring back loadable LSMs</a>.
</p>

<h4>Some history</h4>

<p>
A bit of history is probably in order.  The LSM API came about specifically
because Linus Torvalds didn't want to have to choose between a number of
competing access control mechanisms for the kernel.  Instead, LSM would
provide a way for any of those mechanisms to hook into the kernel and deny
access to various kinds of resources (files, devices, 
tasks, inodes, etc.) based on the security model being implemented.
Initially, the LSMs would be implemented as kernel 
modules that could be loaded at runtime and, in some cases, unloaded.
</p>

<p>
The LSM interface was released as part of the 2.5 development kernel series
in 2002, and was part of the first 2.6 release in December 2003.  For
several years after that, there was only one in-tree user of the interface:
SELinux. That led to a 2005 <a href="/Articles/138042/">suggestion</a> to remove
the LSM API entirely, effectively just calling SELinux directly. That
would turn SELinux
into the "one true security solution" for Linux.  In 2006, James Morris <a
href="/Articles/180194/">proposed a patch</a> to 
move LSM to the "feature removal" list, scheduled for the 2.6.18 kernel,
which was roughly two months out at that point.
</p>

<p>
But, along came <a href="/Articles/244531/">Smack</a>, which implemented a
"simplified" Mandatory Access Control (MAC) scheme for the kernel.  It also
used the LSM interface, so, to a certain extent, the <a
href="/Articles/252562/">decision on whether to merge it</a> hinged on the
future of LSM.  In October 2007, Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/252589/">clearly stated</a> his intention to keep LSM in
the kernel, thus paving the way for Smack to be merged.
</p>

<p>
At more or less the same time Smack was merged, another change to LSM was
made. First <a href="/Articles/239962/">discussed</a> in mid-2007, Torvalds
merged a patch for the 2.6.24 kernel that <a
href="/Articles/255650/">switched LSM to a static interface</a> so that
security "modules" needed to be built into the kernel.  One could still
choose which security module to use with kernel command-line parameters,
but dynamic security module loading would no longer be allowed.
</p>

<p>
There were a number of reasons behind the switch. For one thing, unloading
modules was always messy (or impossible), partly because keeping a coherent
security 
state through that process is difficult.  In addition, the LSM API is very
intrusive, allowing modules to hook nearly any kernel operation, which can
be (and was) abused.  While the LSM symbols were exported as GPL-only, that
didn't stop some proprietary modules from abusing the interface.  There
were also free 
software modules that used the interface for non-security purposes (e.g. <a
href="/Articles/118785/">the realtime "security" module</a>).  Those kinds
of problems could also be used as arguments against having the LSM API at
all, but since Torvalds had already put his foot down on that particular
question, removing the ability to load LSMs was seen as a reasonable
alternative. 
</p>

<p>
At the time that Torvalds merged the patch that made that switch, he asked
for "real world" users 
of loadable security modules to step forward.  There were a few examples of
out-of-tree LSMs that were loadable (and, possibly, unloadable), but none
that actually seemed to <i>require</i> that ability.  The main users of the
feature were LSM developers, who might routinely load and unload their LSM
during development.
</p>

<p>
The next few years saw the merging of Smack (2.6.25), TOMOYO (2.6.30), and
AppArmor (2.6.38).  The latter had been long out of tree; its existence was
part of the reason that the LSM interface came about in the first place.  There have also been
periodic attempts to get smaller, single-purpose security changes into the
kernel over the years, but those were always pointed to the LSM interface.
There is a problem with that particular suggestion, though, as only one LSM
can be active at a time.
Most
distributions already have their one security module "slot" filled up.  Red
Hat and Fedora use SELinux, Ubuntu uses AppArmor, while SUSE and openSUSE
have 
both AppArmor and SELinux available.  Adding a specialized LSM for
additional security 
protections is generally not possible without removing or disabling the
distribution-supplied security solution.
</p>

<h4>Proposed LSM changes</h4>

<p>
That "one LSM at a time" problem has led to persistent (if intermittent)
calls for 
ways to stack or chain LSMs. Smack developer Casey Schaufler is the most
recent to <a href="/Articles/518345/">propose a stacking solution</a>.  His
patch set has been steadily reviewed on the LSM mailing list since it was
first posted in September; it is now up to <a
href="/Articles/525960/">version 8</a>.  That particular version came with an
interesting caveat:
<div class="BigQuote">
I have not tried to
reintroduce LSMs as loadable modules, in spite of the
vigor with which it has been requested. I see that as
work for another day, and a [separate] battle to fight.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Those requests came from the developer of the TOMOYO LSM, Tetsuo Handa.
In earlier discussion of Schaufler's stacking patch, Handa <a
href="/Articles/527227/">advocated</a>  a return to allowing loadable
LSMs.  In fact, he went further than that, proposing a set of patches that would restore the ability
to load LSMs as well as converting TOMOYO to use that feature.
</p>

<p>
Handa lists three reasons for making the change.  To start with, any
distribution that wants to allow its users to experiment with different
LSMs must build all of those LSMs statically into the kernel.  That will
not only increase the size of the kernel, it will also increase the time it
takes to load and boot the kernel.  Most of that space (and time) would be
completely 
wasted even for the users who are experimenting.  All of that makes it less
likely that 
distributions will actually build kernels that way.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, though, many distributions have their preferred LSM, so they
don't build extra LSMs into their kernels.  That leaves users to build
their own kernels, which is generally unacceptable, particularly in
enterprise settings. But even if there are other LSMs built into the
kernel, it takes a 
reboot to enable them.  Handa notes that he uses a loadable kernel module that
implements TOMOYO (called AKARI) to diagnose problems in enterprise
systems.  In order to access the LSM symbols (which are no longer
exported), AKARI must do some kind of runtime address resolution,
perhaps using <tt>/proc/kallsyms</tt> or <tt>System.map</tt>.  But, AKARI
is something he can load into running systems when needed&mdash;unlike
regular LSMs.
</p>

<p>
One could argue that Handa's use of an LSM for system troubleshooting is a
misuse of the interface, but the fact remains that changing LSMs currently
requires a reboot.  That problem potentially becomes more acute if LSM
stacking is merged.  One must decide pre-boot which LSMs to enable (and in
what order they are consulted).  Whatever else can be said, disallowing LSM
loading reduces flexibility.
</p>

<p>
Handa's third reason is a bit more philosophical: "<q>LSM is not the
tool for thought control.</q>"  Essentially, he argues, disallowing LSM
loading just makes dealing with LSMs harder for both users and developers.  It
also means 
that the more "minor" LSMs (e.g. TOMOYO and Smack) get less exposure
because fewer users can actually try them.
</p>

<p>
While there have been no comments on Handa's patches as yet, there have
been expressions of support for loadable LSMs by some.  Schaufler, for
example, does not seem opposed necessarily.  Kees Cook 
<a href="/Articles/527228/">agreed</a> with the need for loadable LSMs,
though he was concerned that combining it with the LSM stacking patches
would potentially block the progress for stacking.  Morris, who authored
the original patch to block loadable LSMs, has not yet spoken up one way or
the other.
</p>

<p>
Taking away the ability to load LSMs did not really change the picture for
the kinds of abuses that were brought up at the time the change was made.
Kernel 
modules can still abuse the interface, though it may take a bit more work.
If binary modules were willing to ignore the GPL-only export of the LSM
interface, they are probably willing to ferret out the addresses they
need instead.  Open source modules can do much the same.  At the time of the
switch to a static interface back in 2007, Torvalds seemed very open to
reverting it if there were real 
users&mdash;perhaps he can still be convinced.

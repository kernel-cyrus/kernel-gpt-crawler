ABI changes can be painful for anybody charged with the development and
maintenance of software; that can be doubly so when the changes happen
inadvertently and take people by surprise.  There is tooling out there that
can search for and report ABI changes.  At <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/">Kernel Recipes 2016</a>, 
Dodji Seketeli presented some early work he has done on a tool that
would find unexpected kernel ABI changes and asked what might seem like an
obvious question: would this functionality be useful to the development
community?
<p>
It is worth noting that he was not talking about the sort of ABI change that
kernel developers worry about the most: changes to the user-space ABI.
Instead, he is focusing on changes to the loadable-module ABI.  At
first blush, that might seem like it could reduce the level of interest in
his work.  As was 
pointed out in the talk, kernel developers are generally unwilling to talk
about the module interface as an ABI at all; at best, it's a fluid API with
no stability guarantees.  This interface is explicitly allowed to change,
so the number of developers wanting a tool to flag those changes might be
thought to be small.
<p>
Interest in this kind of tool comes mostly from distributors.  The
enterprise distributors could use it to let binary-driver vendors know when

<a href="/Articles/703897/"><img

alt="[Dodji Seketeli]" title="Dodji Seketeli" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="left"></a> 

something has changed in the module interface.  But Ben Hutchings, Debian's
kernel maintainer, said that it would be generally useful to avoid making
changes to the module interface when patching a stable kernel.
<p>
The <a
href="https://sourceware.org/libabigail/manual/abidiff.html">abidiff</a>
tool exists to provide just this kind of information.  It reads the ELF
symbol information from an object file, along with any debug information
found there.  It uses that information to build an internal representation
of the ABI, which can be saved in a special XML file.  Given ABI
representations from two different objects, abidiff can report on the
differences between the two.
<p>
Seketeli showed some example output from abidiff; it can be seen in <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/talks/would-an-abi-changes-visualization-tool-be-useful-to-linux-kernel-maintenance/">his
slides</a>.  The tool is able to detect
changes in the types of a function's parameters or its return value.
Anything that changes the size of a structure or the layout of its members
will also be reported on.  The removal of functions is noted, and so on.
There are mechanisms for reducing noise by filtering out changes that might
not be of interest; for example, changes to structures that do not appear
in a specific set of header files can be suppressed.  Other tools built on
top of abidiff can look for ABI changes in libraries stored in package
files. 
<p>
But, he pointed out, none of this works with the kernel now.  But wouldn't
it be nice if we had a tool that could look at a set of kernel modules and
exported interfaces, generating a report of what has changed from a
previous version?
<p>
Getting there requires a bit of work.  The tool would need to understand
and handle the special ELF sections used in the kernel build; the
<tt>__export_symbol</tt> and <tt>__export_symbol_gpl</tt> sections are
particularly relevant.  Kernel modules also need to be parsed properly, and
an interface description generated from the result.  The sheer size of the
kernel presents a problem as well; it will force some memory-usage
optimizations that have not been necessary thus far.  These are the sort of
issues he has been working on.
<p>
Thus far, he has added a kernel-specific mode to the <a
href="https://www.mankier.com/1/abidw">abidw</a> tool, which generates an
XML representation of an ABI from an ELF file for use with abidiff.  Some
examples of the output can be found in <a
href="https://people.redhat.com/~dseketel/kabidiff/">this page</a>.
Anybody wanting to play with this work can grab a copy of the repository by
running:
<p>
<pre>
    git clone -b dodji/kabidiff git://sourceware.org/git/libabigail.git
</pre>
<p>
The discussion of this work was wide-ranging and energetic; it is hard to
report on here.  One topic that came up was the possibility of detecting
changes in the user-space ABI instead; that is a tool that would be useful
for regression testing in general.  That, Seketeli allowed, is a rather
harder problem.  Even just looking at the system-call interface, it can be
hard for a tool to understand what a system call's parameters are supposed
to represent.
<p>
So a user-space ABI checker is probably not on the immediate horizon.  We
probably will see a tool that can find changes in the module interface,
though, and that will have its own uses.  Developers might be surprised to
learn how often the changes they make affect the interface used by
loadable modules.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Interesting stuff when you are on the vendor site of life and have to maintain an out-of-tree driver. Yes, I know, drivers should be upstream, but some are so special (or so lousy programmed ;-)  ) that they won't make into the kernel. <br>
<p>
Looks a bit like the KABI tracking that Red Hat is doing for its Driver Update Program. <br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 1, 2017</br>
           </div>
This is the season where potential topics for the upcoming <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-storage-filesystem-and-mm-summit">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit</a> are discussed; often
that discussion resolves the relevant issues before the actual event.  That
would appear to be the case with the mysterious <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt>
memory-allocation flag.  The development community now know whats it does,
but now it seems that the flag itself may turn out to be a temporary thing.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox <a href="/Articles/713152/">started the discussion</a> by
listing no less than nine different topics that he would like to see addressed at the
summit.  One of those (#8) was "<q>nailing down exactly what
GFP_TEMPORARY means</q>".  This flag was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e12ba74d8ff3e2f73a583500d7095e406df4d093">added
to the 2.6.24 kernel</a> by Mel Gorman in 2007; since then, it has picked
up a few dozen users throughout the kernel.  But, it seems, nobody has ever
documented what the flag's effects are or when it should be used.
<p>
What the flag actually does is relatively straightforward, though it took a
while for the discussion to make it clear.  Vlastimil Babka <a
href="/Articles/713156/">described it</a> this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	GFP_TEMPORARY, compared to GFP_KERNEL, adds __GFP_RECLAIMABLE,
	which tries to place the allocation within MIGRATE_RECLAIMABLE
	pageblocks - GFP_KERNEL implies MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE pageblocks, and
	userspace allocations are typically MIGRATE_MOVABLE.
</div>
<p>
All of this is driven by the need to <a href="/Articles/368869/">defragment
memory</a> so that 
multiple-page allocations can be made when needed.  Pages that are
allocated for user-space memory are relatively easy to manage in this
regard since they can be relocated elsewhere in physical memory; as long
as the page-table entries are updated accordingly, the application(s) using
those pages won't even be aware that they have moved.  The kernel groups
such pages together into regions of memory marked <tt>MIGRATE_MOVABLE</tt>
in the hopes of being able to clear large contiguous areas of memory when
the need arises.  Keeping non-movable pages out of that area minimizes the
risk of a single nailed-down page thwarting an effort to clear a range of
memory.
<p>
Memory allocated for the kernel is not so easy to relocate, though, since
the memory-management subsystem has no way to know where the references to
any given page of memory might be or even how many of them exist.  Thus, as
a general rule, kernel-space memory allocations must be assumed to be
eternally fixed in place; they cannot be put into the
<tt>MIGRATE_MOVABLE</tt> regions.  That said, some kernel-space memory has
at least the possibility of being freed when memory gets tight.  Memory
allocated from a slab allocator with an associated shrinker callback falls
into this category, for example.  If this "reclaimable" memory is grouped
together and kept separate from the completely unmovable memory, then there
is at least a chance of freeing some usable blocks of pages when the
shrinkers are run.  The <tt>__GFP_RECLAIMABLE</tt> flag indicates memory
that can (maybe) be reclaimed by the kernel in this way.
<p>
So <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> sets the <tt>__GFP_RECLAIMABLE</tt> flag, causing
allocations to be taken from the <tt>MIGRATE_RECLAIMABLE</tt> block.  That
describes what the flag does, but not how it is meant to be used.  After
some discussion, it became evident that, in fact, nobody really seemed to
know what the intended use case for <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> is.
<p>
For example, one might imagine that, from its name, <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt>
is intended for short-lived allocations — those that will be freed in the
near future.  But, <a href="/Articles/713162/">Wilcox asked</a>, what does
short-lived mean in this context?  Is it permissible for kernel code to
block while holding a <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocation, for example?  Or,
instead, should preemption be disabled while holding that allocation?
Would allocating data structures for I/O operations (which could take
30&nbsp;seconds to time out) as <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> be acceptable?  In
other words, what are the promises that a kernel developer needs to make to
perform a <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocation, and what benefits come from
making those promises?
<p>
With regard to the acceptable time period, it turns out there is no clear
answer.  In the above-linked message, Babka said: "<q>There's no simple
connection to time, it depends on the larger picture</q>". This led to
complaints from developers like <a href="/Articles/713165/">Neil Brown</a>,
who, understandably, thought that a name involving "temporary" would be
somehow related to time.  He also suggested that the whole idea is somewhat
shaky, and that, if it works at all to reduce fragmentation, that is more a
matter of luck.  His suggestion was to look, instead, at mechanisms to
render kernel-allocated objects movable so that active defragmentation
could be performed.  This is an interesting idea, but it is also less than
trivial to implement and beyond the scope of the current discussion.
<p>
Wilcox, meanwhile, <a href="/Articles/713166/">continued trying</a> to
determine the situations in which <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> should be used.  It
seems that it should not be used with <tt>kmalloc()</tt> calls, since the
slab allocators ignore it.  It is possible to hold these allocations for a
considerable period of time.  He suggested that there might be two possible
benefits from using <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt>: a higher chance of successfully
allocating the memory, and making larger allocations more likely to succeed
in general.  Babka <a href="/Articles/713167/">responded</a> that nothing
in the memory-management code makes <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> allocations more
likely to succeed, but that the general benefit for larger allocations
might exist.
<p>
In the end, nobody was able to come up with a simple answer to the question
of when <tt>GFP_TEMPORARY</tt> should be used.  So Michal Hocko <a
href="/Articles/713168/">concluded</a> that perhaps it shouldn't exist at
all:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	From the current discussion so far it really seems that it would be
	really hard to define sensible semantic for GFP_TEMPORARY with the
	current implementation so I will send a patch to simply drop this
	flag. If we want to have such a flag then we should start over with
	defining the semantic first and think this thing over properly.
</div>
<p>
Subsystems like memory management are full of heuristics intended to
improve the behavior of the system.  The nature of heuristics, though,
tends to make their use and benefits a bit fuzzy at times, especially in the
absence of focused testing (as appears to be the case here).  But even
ineffective heuristics can end up wired into the system to the point where
nobody questions their existence.  One of the good things about
free-software development is that it makes it easy for fresh eyes to come
in and generate awkward questions.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thank you for the article! I've been reading the discussion and feeling stupid because I still couldn't tease out what the difference was here. The article makes this a bit clearer. Maybe we ought to rename this to GFP_SHRINKABLE?<br>
<p>
IOW, suppose I have a set of allocations that I'm doing that have a decent chance of being freed when a shrinker runs. Would that be a clear enough guideline of when it ought to be used?<br>

A "decent chance" does mean much the same as a "good enough chance", and it is about as precise.  "good enough" for what, exactly?<br>
I was playing with words by drawing a parallel between the word "decent" used here, and the concept of "moral decency" which varies wildly from place to place, and even from person to person.  I was trying to make the point that "decent", in either usage, doesn't mean anything without a lot of context.  Is a "decent chance" 50%? or 95%? or 99.999% ?<br>
<p>
This was my main point in the discussion. "Temporary" is a context dependent term, and no clear context was given.  In the same way, "decent" is a context dependent term, and so not useful for defining an API. That is all I was trying to say.<br>

Thanks for clarification. <br>
<p>
If I understand you correctly, you make the point that "good enough" ain't an objective reason that a potential user of GFP_TEMPORARY can claim. The objective should be measurable. I can understand both viewpoints (»express explicitly« vs. »need to express my intention though it might not be precise«); AFAICS, I can endorse your's actually more than the one from the OP.<br>

Sorry to have plagued you, but as a non-native speaker I'm often wondering what I miss in conversations and learned the hard way that it's better to ask. Again, thanks for taking the time to answer me.<br>

If they are generic kmalloc() or alloc_pages*(), but their lifetime is still linked to something freed by a shrinker, then that might work and perhaps have a better defined semantics than GFP_TEMPORARY. But if these are small (&lt; PAGE_SIZE) objects allocated by kmalloc(), then it currently won't work properly, as has been said in the thread and article.<br>
<p>
So if you have such use case, please make it known in the thread :)<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 4, 2022</br>
           </div>
The kernel has thousands of configuration options, many of which can change
the kernel's behavior in subtle or surprising ways.  Among those options is
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18.8/source/drivers/android/Kconfig"><tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt></a>,
which one might expect to be relatively straightforward; its description
reads, in its entirety: "<q>Enable support for various drivers needed on
the Android platform</q>".  It turns out that this option does more than
that, to the surprise of some users.  That has led to a plan to remove this
option, but that has brought a surprise or two of its own — and some
disagreement — as well.
<p>
The discussion started when Alex Xu <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/1656357116.rhe0mufk6a.none@localhost/">reported</a>
a read-copy-update (RCU) error that was appearing on his system after
resuming from suspend.
Shortly thereafter, Xu realized that the problem was tied to the fact that
his kernel had been built with <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> enabled; among other
things, that option significantly reduces the time that can elapse before
RCU starts putting out stall warnings.  RCU maintainer Paul McKenney was
not entirely sympathetic after this was revealed:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	And let's face it, the intent and purpose of CONFIG_ANDROID=y is
	extremely straightforward and unmistakable.  So perhaps people not
	running Android devices but wanting a little bit of the Android
	functionality should do something other than setting
	CONFIG_ANDROID=y in their .config files.  Me, I am surprised that
	it took this long for something like this to bite you.
</blockquote>
<p>
This response comes from a part of the discussion that does not appear
directly in the archives, but can be seen quoted in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1656421946.ic03168yc3.none@localhost/">Xu's
answer</a>, where he points out that both Debian and Fedora ship kernels
with <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> enabled, since that is the only way to make
the binder 
module available.  Xu suggested that the intent of this option is not quite as
"<q>straightforward and unmistakable</q>" as one might think; the one-line
description mentions nothing about changing internal RCU timeout values.
"<q>If major distro vendors are consistently making this 'mistake', then
perhaps the problem is elsewhere</q>".
<p>
Christoph Hellwig was quick to show up with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220629150102.1582425-2-hch@lst.de/">a patch</a>
removing <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> altogether, describing it as "<q>obviously
a bad idea</q>".  Greg Kroah-Hartman was equally quick to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YrxvWT%2FaeQnwEv52@kroah.com/">agree</a> and queue
the patch for the next merge window.  Nobody else objected — until Jason
Donenfeld <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yrx5Lt7jrk5BiHXx@zx2c4.com/">pointed
out</a> that this option has other surprising effects, and that removing it
could create problems on Android systems.
<p>
Specifically, both the random-number generator and the <a
href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> VPN tunnel 
implementation will make changes in response to the system being
suspended.  The random-number generator will reseed itself after the system
resumes, while WireGuard will clear its key material just prior to
suspending.  Both actions are intended to improve security, but they can be
problematic on Android systems due to how power management is handled
there.  Devices running Android are narcoleptic; they will go to sleep at
any opportunity in order to save power.  Resetting the random-number
generator that frequently is inefficient at best, and clearing the
WireGuard keys that often may disrupt communications entirely.  To avoid
such problems, these actions are not taken if the kernel has been built
with <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt>.
<p>
The removal of <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> also removes that special behavior;
this is a change that, Donenfeld feared, could create regressions in the
future.  He asked Hellwig for either an assurance that these problems would
not result, or for an updated version of the patch that fixed those
problems.  There followed a not-entirely-pleasant discussion over whose
responsibility it was to fix any problems, whether that use of
<tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> was correct, whether the removal constitutes
a user-space ABI regression, and so on.
<p>
Eventually Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YryFKXsx%2FBgv%2FoBE@kroah.com/">signaled</a> his
agreement with Hellwig.  Any problems experienced by Android devices, he
said, would be long since found and fixed by the time a patched kernel
actually is shipped to such a device, but the change might fix
desktop-related problems now.  So this change appears to be headed toward
the mainline.
<p>
At the core of the debate was the use of <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> as an
indicator that the system will suspend and resume frequently.  But, as has
been seen, there are many systems with <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> enabled that
do not exhibit that behavior, but which are getting the related changes anyway.
There may also be systems that suspend
frequently and that should see that behavior, but which are not running
Android and do not have <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> enabled.  The consensus
seems to be that 
using <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt> to regulate RCU stall timeouts or
cryptographic power-management responses is a bug that is in need of
fixing.
<p>
So, for the purposes of random numbers and WireGuard, some other way to
indicate that the system will suspend frequently will be needed.  There was
talk of a new configuration option or a sysfs knob that could be written to
from user space, which would allow the behavior to be changed at run time.
Your editor's <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87a69slh0x.fsf@meer.lwn.net/">suggestion</a> that
the kernel could observe actual suspend behavior and do the right thing on
its own was fairly quickly dismissed.
<p>
What will happen instead, it seems, is the addition of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220630191230.235306-1-kaleshsingh@google.com/">a
new configuration option</a>, called <tt>CONFIG_PM_USERSPACE_AUTOSLEEP</tt>,
that prepares the kernel for a system that will suspend frequently and
enables the (formerly) Android-specific behavior.  This option has a more
extensive help text describing what it actually does and warning that it
"<q>should not be enabled just for fun</q>".  The necessary Android changes
have already been created, and this appears to be a solution that everybody
involved is happy with.
<p>
The way this solution came about could have been better, though.  The
kernel community works best when developers work together toward a common
goal rather than argue over who is doing things incorrectly.  That did
eventually happen here, but it took some time to get to 
that point.  It took multiple developers to endow <tt>CONFIG_ANDROID</tt>
with its somewhat confusing semantics; it is unsurprising that it took more
than one person to straighten it out.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Not to compound the peanut-gallery-ing, but couldn&#x27;t you achieve forward secrecy in wireguard anyway?<br>
<p>
Just do the clearing of keys before every suspend like you normally should, while tracking suspends.<br>
If the last several suspends have been happening too frequently, then do the android thing and stop clearing keys (at least for a while).<br>

It already does it on non-android systems. There&#x27;d be some interruption caused on android devices until the kernel realized it was being suspended frequently, at which point it would start ignoring the suspends (the android behavior).<br>

The one caveat to this I can think of is maybe this is a hypothetical attack vector? Like maybe an attacker could prevent key-switching by suspending the device (a laptop?) frequently?<br>

Actually, it doesn&#x27;t. It is supposed to, but as mentioned in the article, Fedora and Debian turn on CONFIG_ANDROID. So in the real world, majority of users get Android-like behaviour. Wireguard&#x27;s gimnastics with key-cleaning is not executed.<br>

It seems to me like you would then have the issue that an attacker could &quot;trick&quot; the system into the less secure mode just by causing a few short sleeps. You could try to mitigate that too, but then the odds are it would come back to bite you at some point in the future.<br>

This is the correct answer indeed.<br>
<p>
FYI, before Corbet asked about this in that thread, somebody posed the same question with a bit more thoughtfulness on the WireGuard mailing list:<br>

If various people in these comments think they have worthwhile alternative ideas for this, that might be a good thread to jump in on and propose patches or different algorithms or whatever else.<br>

I thought this was what the existing CONFIG_PM_AUTOSLEEP and wakelock system was for, but it sounds like Android doesn&#x27;t even use it, or else these codepaths would already be using it too. In that case, what&#x27;s it good for?<br>

Now that there are mobile devices running Linux based non-Android distros and people using them that probably want frequent suspends to reduce power usage there but the corresponding distros won&#x27;t be enabling CONFIG_PM_USERSPACE_AUTOSLEEP in their main builds that are used on desktops and servers, does that mean distros need a second Linux kernel build just for mobile devices that want the behaviour?<br>
<p>
It seems like runtime configuration of this behaviour, or simply the automatic handling of too-frequent suspends proposed in comments above, are the more correct solutions to this problem.<br>

I suggested a runtime configuration knob and wrote a patch for it, but the Android developers didn&#x27;t want to add new ABI and felt a compile time knob would be sufficient. It didn&#x27;t really make a difference to me, so I said okay, and wrote a sample patch for a compile time knob too. But if somebody else has an expanded use case, this is a pretty darn easy thing to change into a runtime switch later.<br>
<p>
As for your repeating of Corbet&#x27;s comment that this is handled automatically, see <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/wireguard/CAHmME9p2OYSTX2C5M0faKtw2N8jiyohvRqnAPKa=e7BWynF7fQ@mail.gmail.com/T/">https://lore.kernel.org/wireguard/CAHmME9p2OYSTX2C5M0faKt...</a> for a thread where somebody asked the same thing, and we took it to its logical conclusion which is having laptops wake up in backpacks. If you have better ideas, though, feel free to reply on that mailing list and I&#x27;d be very happy to consider good alternatives.<br>

I think you have misinterpreted the suggestion in the second last post in the thread. They were not suggesting that expiry of the time period cause wakeups, but instead that when something else caused a wakeup, then before using the keys again, check if the minimum time has passed and do the key expiry and renegotiation then. Doing it that way would not cause laptops to wake up in backpacks. This does mean that keys stay around across suspend and maybe that is not desirable though?<br>

<p>
I don&#x27;t see an issue in requiring distros that ship mobile GUI frontends to also ship their own kernel. You probably already don&#x27;t want to ship your server&#x27;s kernel (see preemption settings) and you&#x27;re going to be shipping completely different images for desktop vs. ARM handset already anyway. Asking a distro to have a second kernel package for an entirely different class of device really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, especially when said kernel likely needs certain things for powersaving and Android compatibility tuned for it.<br>
<p>
For what it&#x27;s worth, my experience in the ARM ecosystem is that we&#x27;ll never get to have one kernel that fits all use cases there simply due to all the erratas and different device requirements.<br>

We are already there for 64-bit ARM and 32-bit ARMv7, distros only ship one mainline Linux kernel image for all devices. Of course for non-mainline devices its a different situation, you need one Linux kernel image per device, but most generic distros outside the hardware-specific distros do not support non-mainline devices.<br>
<p>
I very much doubt distros would add a mobile variant just for one config option. Distros do not want to have multiple images for different use-cases, they want one Linux kernel image that boots on any hardware and works for any use-case. I think they might accept a boot-time option though if automatic behaviour selection at boottime or runtime really isn&#x27;t going to be implemented, a boot option is still a bit of a hack though.<br>
<p>
At least that is the situation for Debian arm64 and armhf. For arm64 it has a single image for devices and also a -cloud image that contains a cut-down image with only cloud related config to reduce the image size and boot time. For armhf Debian ships two &quot;multiplatform&quot; kernel flavours; with and without LPAE.  Also -rt images for both because RT isn&#x27;t able to be enabled/disabled at boot or runtime.<br>

<p>
This commentary is hyperbolic and isn&#x27;t supported by the actual timeline when you open up the thread and look at the time stamps.<br>
<p>
It begins here, &lt;<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220629150102.1582425-2-hch@lst.de/">https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220629150102.1582425-2-...</a>&gt;, Wed, 29 Jun 2022 17:01:02 +0200. I immediately asked, &quot;will this break my stuff? If not, can you mention why in the commit message?&quot; Christoph didn&#x27;t like this, and we went back in forth to the tune of &quot;please don&#x27;t intentionally break my stuff, or if you&#x27;re not, say why not; I haven&#x27;t researched it yet myself&quot;, &quot;no, your situation is BS, I&#x27;ll break what I want&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s not helpful&quot;, &quot;why should I have to explain myself&quot;, and so on. My last message to Christoph was at Wed, 29 Jun 2022 19:42:28 +0200, at which point he ducked out. That span comprised basically the entire thing related to Corbet&#x27;s statement, which you can read again:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The way this solution came about could have been better, though. The kernel community works best when developers work together toward a common goal rather than argue over who is doing things incorrectly. That did eventually happen here, but it took some time to get to that point.</font><br>
<p>
Meanwhile, my entreaties not to intentionally break my stuff and some mentions of various Android source files garnered the attention of Android developers, and Kalesh jumped in at Wed, 29 Jun 2022 12:05:23 -0700. We had a discussion on whether this should be a runtime knob or a compile time switch. I wrote inline sample patches for each method, just so there&#x27;d be something concrete to work with and discuss, and mentioned whichever one they want is fine. There was some discussion on describing a device versus describing behavior. And then by the time I woke up in the morning, we had a viable patch (based on one of my earlier inline samples) for the kernel, and then for Android, and then Greg took the patches, and the whole thing was done.<br>
<p>
So... I don&#x27;t think Corbet&#x27;s editorializing is even minutely correct:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The way this solution came about could have been better, though. The kernel community works best when developers work together toward a common goal rather than argue over who is doing things incorrectly. That did eventually happen here, but it took some time to get to that point.</font><br>
<p>
Alex raised the initial issue. Christoph wrote a patch for it. That patch broke my stuff, and Christoph didn&#x27;t want to work on that. So he ducked out, and I took the baton and worked with the Android developers. And this all happened in the span of a day or two. This sounds a lot more like kernel developers working together toward a common goal and accomplishing something in a short span of time. Yes, there was some minor argument in there. But it didn&#x27;t seem to affect anybody actually getting anything done in a swift and timely manner.<br>
<p>
So while _maybe_ there&#x27;s some minorly newsworthy content (one config knob is gone, now there&#x27;s another, interesting forward secrecy considerations in the process), the dramatization and fingerwagging in this piece seems unnecessary.<br>

Not commenting on the dramatization part but on the pure content I found it both educational and entertaining that CONFIG_ANDROID 1. existed 2. did random things totally unrelated to each other 3. is used in very popular distros.<br>

I already knew that Kconfig is a mess (less than in all other projects but still) but I really didn&#x27;t expect something that bad to exist. Now I have been warned, thanks!<br>

<p>
Last branch records (LBRs) are hardware registers on Intel CPUs that
allow sampling branches.  These registers hold a ring buffer of the most
recent branch decisions that can be used to reconstruct the program's behavior.
Last week, we examined the <a
href="/Articles/680985/">basics of LBRs</a> 
using Linux perf.  Now we look at some more advanced uses.

<h4>Transactional memory</h4>

<p>
The Transactional Synchronization Extension (TSX) is a hardware
transactional memory implementation, available in Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadwell_%28microarchitecture%29">Broadwell</a> or later,
that can improve performance for critical regions by speculatively
executing them in parallel. For tuning TSX programs, the goal is usually
to reduce unnecessary transaction aborts.
The perf <tt>--branch-history</tt> option can also be useful to see why <a href="/Articles/534758/">TSX transactions</a> aborted. Normally we
cannot see into TSX transactions because any profiling interrupt aborts the transaction.
But LBRs can log branches even inside transactions, so <tt>--branch-history</tt> can show
why the abort happened.

<p>
This is particularly useful for internal aborts that are
caused by the code inside the transaction itself, such as those caused by
transaction-aborting
instructions like system calls.  That allows seeing what led to the system call
being executed. For conflict aborts 
caused by other threads, they may be visible if the abort happens to be near the
instruction that touched the conflicting cache line. There is no guarantee
of that,  
though, as the conflict could hit at any point in the transaction.

<p>
The LBRs also have flags that show that a particular branch was in a transaction or is an abort.
This is currently not displayed by <tt>--branch-history</tt>, but can be examined manually through
<tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt> or <a
href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/perf-script"><tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt></a>.
For more details see the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/05/03/intelr-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intelr-tsx-profiling-with-linux-0">perf TSX tutorial</a>.

<h4>Branch mispredictions</h4>

<p>
In addition to the "from" and to "addresses" of branches, LBRs also provide
fine-grained information on branch misprediction. 
Modern CPUs have a long pipeline to execute instructions, and rely on accurately predicting the branch targets to keep the pipeline
filled.  This is done by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor">branch predictor</a>. When branches are
often mispredicted, performance is typically poor, as the CPU has to throw away a lot of work. 
Often code that is difficult to predict can be restructured to make it easier for the branch predictor to handle
(the <a
href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf">Intel
optimization manual [644-page PDF]</a> describes some techniques on how to do this).

<p>
Mispredicted branches can be sampled directly using CPU-performance-counter
events, but deriving them
from LBRs gives better coverage and does not require an additional
performance counter. 
<tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt> can directly display the branch misprediction state, but currently only at function level.</p>

<p>
Here is an example based on a <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-an-unsorted-array">Stack
Overflow
question</a>, asking why processing a sorted array is faster than
processing an
unsorted array. 
It fills an array with random numbers and then executes a loop with conditional jumps depending on the random data. These jumps
are random and often mispredicted.

<pre>
      1 /* mispredict.c */
      2 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
      3 #define N 200000000
      4 int main(void)
      5 {
      6 	int *data = malloc(N * sizeof(int));
      7 	int i, k;
      8 	for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
      9 		data[i] = rand() % 256;
     10 
     11 	volatile int sum;
     12 	for (k = 0; k &lt; 50; k++)
     13 		for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     14 			if (data[i] &gt;= 128)
     15 				sum += data[i];
     16 }
</pre>

<pre>
    % gcc -g -o mispredict mispredict.c
    % perf record -b perf stat ./mispredict

     Performance counter stats for './mispredict':

	23,293,062,786      branches                                                      (100.00%)
	 5,008,912,919      branch-misses             #   21.50% of all branches          (100.00%)

    % perf report --sort symbol_from,symbol_to,mispredict --stdio
    ...
    # Overhead  Source Symbol    Target Symbol       Branch Mispredicted
    # ........  ...............  ..................  ...................
    #
	53.46%  [k] main         [k] main            N                  
	27.21%  [.] main         [.] main            N                  
	17.22%  [.] main         [.] main            Y                  
</pre>

<p>
Now we know that 17% of the total branches are mispredicted in <tt>main()</tt>.
We could now attempt to fix them to speed up the program,
such as by sorting the array first to make the <tt>if</tt> statement more
predictable. 
Unfortunately, perf doesn't tell us directly on which
line they occur, at least yet.

<h4>LBR filtering</h4>

<p>
Previously we looked at all branches using LBRs, but the CPU also supports
filtering 
the branch types, so that not all branch types are logged. This can be useful to get more
context. <tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt> supports branch filtering using the
<tt>-j</tt> option with the following types:

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=4>
<tr><th align="left">Name</th><th align="left">Meaning</th></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td><tt>any_call</tt></td><td>any function call or system call</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td><tt>any_ret</tt></td><td>any function return or system call return</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td><tt>ind_call</tt></td><td>any indirect branch</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td><tt>u</tt></td><td>only when the branch target is at the user level</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td><tt>k</tt></td><td>only when the branch target is in the kernel</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td><tt>hv</tt></td><td>only when the target is at the hypervisor level</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td><tt>in_tx</tt></td><td>only when the target is in a hardware transaction</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td><tt>no_tx</tt></td><td>only when the target is not in a hardware transaction</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td><tt>abort_tx</tt></td><td>only when the target is a hardware transaction abort</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td><tt>cond</tt></td><td>conditional branches</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

For example:

<pre>
    % perf record -j any_call,any_ret ...
</pre>
would record any function calls and returns.
Note that not all filter types are supported by all CPUs. If a filter is
missing, perf will 
fall back to filtering in software (which does not increase the effective
size of the LBR) and
the hypervisor option is only supported on POWER CPUs currently.
<p>

Filtering is mostly useful when LBRs are being used for debugging. There is
an exception, which is described next, but
we usually want to see all branches.

<h4>LBR call graph</h4>

<p>
In many cases while profiling we want the function call graph for each sample (<tt>perf&nbsp;record&nbsp;-g</tt>); otherwise
it is not clear why a function was executed. Traditionally
this was implemented by using the frame pointer information set up by the
compiler that resides on the stack.
Since frame pointers can be somewhat expensive on some x86 CPUs, 64-bit binaries
often don't include them; GCC defaults to not enabling them. This results
in incomplete call graphs.

<p>
Newer perf versions also support using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF</a> unwind information to
get the call graph,
but this is quite expensive, since the stack needs to be copied for each
sample, and it also doesn't  
always work.
<p>

Since <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29">Haswell</a>,
the LBRs have a new mode where the CPU logs every call and 
return into 
the LBR and treats them as a stack. This results in the CPU keeping track
of the current 
call graph. Since version 3.19, perf supports this mode to collect this
LBR-based call graph. 
In this case, it also saves/restores the LBRs in the context switch.
<p>

<pre>
    % perf record --call-graph lbr program
    % perf report
</pre>

There are some limitations; for example, C++ exceptions or user-space
threading can corrupt 
the call stack. But for typical usage, it works quite well.
This feature is especially useful with just-in-time (JIT) compilers that
cannot generate frame 
pointers.

<h4>Timed LBR</h4>

The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake_%28microarchitecture%29">Skylake</a>
CPUs, beyond just extending the number of LBRs to 32 entries, 
also added a 
new "timed LBR"  
feature. The CPU logs how many cycles occurred between the branches logged
in the LBR. 
<p>
In an aggressive <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution">out-of-order</a>
CPU like Skylake, the time when something "occurred" can be a somewhat
fuzzy concept:  
the CPU pipeline executes many instructions in parallel, and parts of the instructions
in the basic block may have been executed before or after the branches. The LBR cycles are logged
when the branches are issued. Still, the cycles provide a useful, rough
indication how 
long the code area between the branches took.

<p>
This allows much more fine-grained accounting of cycles than what is
normally possible 
with sampling. Also, unlike manual instrumentation of programs with timing
calls, 
it has only a minor and tunable overhead — only the sampling overhead, which can be tuned by
lowering the sampling frequency.</p>

<a href="/Articles/681346/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/lbr-cycles-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Cycle annotation]" width=400 height=259>
</a>

<p>
Starting with version 4.2, perf uses the timed LBR information in <tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt> 
and in <tt>perf&nbsp;annotate</tt> to report "instructions per cycle" and the
average number of cycles for specific basic blocks.
The aggregated average cycles per basic block are reported
by <tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt> in the branch view at a function level.
The interactive version of <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/perf-annotate"><tt>perf&nbsp;annotate</tt></a> (available
when browsing samples through <tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt>) can also show
the average cycles and instructions per cycle directly with the source and
assembler code (see screen shot at right):

<pre>
    % perf record -b ./div
    % perf report
    &lt;navigate to a sample&gt;
    &lt;press right cursor key&gt;
    &lt;select annotate&gt;
</pre>

This example uses the <a href="/Articles/681389/"><tt>div.c</tt>
program</a> from last week's article. 
The first column shows the average number of cycles for a block. In this case,
the generated code 
jumps into the middle of a block, so we have an overlapping short and long
block, 
but we see that the long block, which includes the two divisions, takes ~25
cycles on average. 
The short block takes about 6 cycles.
The second column is the IPC (instructions per cycle) for the block.

<p>
This allows analysis of how long it takes to execute blocks of instructions in real
programs without having to write custom micro-benchmarks.

<h4>Virtualization</h4>

LBRs are a model-specific feature and are normally not available in virtual
machines since
most hypervisors do 
not virtualize them. There is <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/143279">some work</a> in KVM to support LBR virtualization (which has not been merged so far), but other hypervisors, such as Xen and VMware,
do not support it. That means to use LBRs the workload currently has to run
in a non-virtualized 
environment.

<p>
LBRs work great in containers, though.

<h4>Virtual LBR with Processor Trace</h4>

<p>
When using LBRs it would be often useful to have more entries than the 8-32 that 
are currently available to see more context. However, the CPU cannot
provide more than it has implemented in hardware. 
There is a way of using <a href="/Articles/648154/">Processor Trace</a> (PT) to generate virtual, arbitrary-sized LBRs.
PT records all jumps for a particular area in memory. The PT
decoder can generate virtual 
perf samples from such a stream. Unlike normal LBRs, PT has more overhead.
It requires a CPU with Processor Trace support (<tt>grep&nbsp;intel_pt&nbsp;/proc/cpuinfo</tt>), such as
Broadwell or Skylake.
<p>

<pre>
    % start program
    # capture 1 second of execution
    % perf record -e intel_pt//u -p $(pidof program) sleep 1
    % perf report --itrace=10usl60c --branch-history
</pre>

This example samples the PT stream every 10&mu;s with a call graph, and
attaches the last 60 
branches as LBR entries to each sample. Normally, the result is analyzed
using <tt>--branch-history</tt>. 
This allows seeing much longer paths.
Note that it is often not feasible to record long program executions, as it
may generate 
data faster than the disk can keep up with.
Virtual LBRs with PT have been added in perf version 4.5.

<h4>Debugging</h4>

Last branch records can be also used for debugging to find out what
happened before a crash. 
One problem is that the crash handler often "pollutes" the LBRs before
their contents 
can be logged. The perf code is able to save the LBRs on each context
switch, but there 
is currently no interface for a user-space debugger like GDB to access that
information.

<p>
Using them for system-wide debugging typically requires using LBR filtering
or custom 
kernel changes to disable and re-enable them on exceptions. They work
fairly well from JTAG debuggers 
(such as the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-system-debugger">Intel System Debugger</a>)
because the JTAG debugger does not execute branches and pollute the LBRs while executing.
Generally Processor Trace is more versatile for debugging because the
traces can provide much larger windows 
into program execution.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
LBRs are a powerful mechanism that can help with performance tuning
and debugging. They can be used to look into TSX transactions and  to get
call stacks without the need for frame pointers. On recent CPUs they
allow fine-grained timing of instruction blocks, often doing away with
the need to write custom micro-benchmarks to understand performance
at the instruction level.

<p>
Perf already has good support for many performance
tuning uses of LBRs.  Some improvements, especially better support
for resolving source lines and better display of hot paths, will
hopefully be implemented in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks for this series, great source of information!<br>

I'm especially happy about the LBR call graph support, which I didn't know about before. I've often been troubled by the call-graph support in perf, but with --call-graph lbr things look much better!<br>

           <p>February 28, 2012</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by John Stultz</p>
           </div>
<h4>Overview and Introduction</h4>

<p>
A face-to-face meeting of the  <a
href=http://elinux.org/Android_Mainlining_Project>Android mainlining
interest group</a>, which is a community interested in upstreaming the Android patch
set into the Linux kernel, was 
organized by Tim Bird (Sony/CEWG) and hosted by Linaro Connect on
February 10th.  Also in attendance were representatives from
Linaro, TI, ST-Ericsson, NVIDIA, Google's Android and ChromeOS teams, among
others.</p>

<p>The meeting was held to give better visibility into the various
upstreaming efforts going on, making sure any potential collaboration
between interested parties was able to happen.  It covered a lot of ground,
mostly discussing Android features that recently were re-added to the
staging directory and how these features might be reworked so that they can
be moved into mainline officially. But a number of features that are still
out of tree were also covered.</p>

<p>Kicking off the meeting, participants introduced themselves and their
interests 
in the group. Also some basic goals were covered just to make sure everyone
was on the same page.  Tim summarized his goals for the project as: to let
android run on a vanilla mainline kernel, and everyone agreed to this as a
desired outcome. 
<p>
Tim also articulated an important concern in achieving this
goal is the need to avoid regressions. As Android is actively shipping on a
huge number of devices, we need to take care that getting things upstream
at the cost of short term stability to users isn't an acceptable
trade-off. To this point, Brian Swetland (Google) clarified that the Google
Android developers are quite open to changes in interfaces. Since
Android releases both userland and kernel bundled together, there is
less of a strict need for backward API compatibility. Thus it's not the specific
interfaces they rely on, but the expected behavior of the functionality
provided. 
<p>
This is a key point, as there is little value in upstreaming the
Android patches if the resulting code isn't actually
usable by Android. A major source of difficulty here is that the expected
behavior of features added in the Android patch set isn't always obvious,
and there is little in the way of design documentation. Zach Pfeffer
(Linaro) suggested that one way to both improve community understanding
of the expected behavior, as well as helping to avoid regressions, would be
to provide unit tests. Currently Android is for the most part tested at a
system level, and there are very few unit tests for the kernel features
added. Thus creating a collection of unit tests would be beneficial, and
Zach volunteered to start that effort.</p>
<p>
<h4>Run-time power management and wakelocks</h4>

<p>At this point, the discussion was handed
over to Magnus Damm to talk about power domain support as well as the wakelock
implementation that the power management maintainer <a
href="/Articles/479841/">Rafael Wysocki had recently posted</a>
to the Linux kernel mailing list. The Android team said they were reviewing
Rafael's patches to establish if they were sufficient and would be
commenting on them soon.  
<p>
Magnus asked if full suspend was still necessary
now that run-time power-management has improved; Brian clarified that
this isn't an either/or sort of situation. Android has long used dynamic
power management techniques at run time, and they are very excited about using
the run-time power-management framework to further to save power, but they
also want to use suspend to further reduce power usage. They really would
like to see deep idle for minutes to hours in length, but, even with
CONFIG_NOHZ, there are still a number of periodic timers that keep them from
reaching that goal. Using the wakelocks infrastructure to suspend allows them to
achieve those goals. 
<p>
Magnus asked if Android developers could provide some
data on how effective run-time power-management was compared to suspend
using wakelocks, and to let him know if there are any particular issues that
can be addressed. The Android developers said they would look into it, and
the discussion continued on to Tim and his work with the logger.</p>
<p>
<h4>Logger</h4>

<p>Back in December, <a href="/Articles/473999/">Tim posted the
logger patches</a> to the linux-kernel list and got feedback for changes
that he wanted to 
run by the Android team to make sure there were no objections. The first of
these, which the Android developers supported, is to convert static buffer
allocation to dynamic allocation at run-time. 
<p>
Tim also shared some
thoughts on changing the log dispatching mechanism.  Currently logger
provides a separation between application logs and system logs, preventing
a noisy application from causing system messages to be lost.  In addition,
one potential security issue the Android team has been thinking about is a
poorly-written (or deliberately malicious) application dumping private
information into the log; that information could
then be read by any other application on the system.  A proposal to work
around this problem is per-application log buffers; however, with users able to
add hundreds of applications, per-application or per-group partitioning
would consume a large amount of memory.  The alternative - pushing the
logs out to the filesystem - concerns the Android team as it complicates
post-crash recovery and also creates more I/O contention, which can cause
very poor performance on flash devices. 
<p>
Additionally, the benefits from
doing the logging in the kernel rather than in user space are low overhead,
accurate tagging, and no scheduler thrashing. The Android developers are
also very hesitant to add more long-lived daemons to the system, as while
phones have gained quite a lot of memory and cpu capacity, there is still
pressure to use Android on less-capable devices.  
<p>
Another concern with some
of the existing community logging efforts going on is that Android
developers don't really want strongly structured logging, or binary
logging, because it further complicates accessing the data when the system
has crashed. With plain text logging, there is no need for special tools or
versioning issues should the structure change between newer and older
devices. In difficult situations, with plain text logging, a raw memory
dump of the device can still provide very useful information. Tim 
discussed a proposed filesystem interface to the logger to which the
Android team re-iterated their interface agnosticism, as long as access
control is present and writing to the log is cheap. Tim promised to
benchmark his prototypes to ensure performance doesn't degrade.</p>
<p>
<h4>ION</h4>

<p>From here, the discussion moved to <a
href="/Articles/480055/">ION</a> with Hiroshi Doyu (NVIDIA)
leading the discussion. There had been an earlier meeting at Linaro Connect
focusing on graphics that some of the ION developers attended, so Jesse
Barker (Linaro) summarized that discussion. The basic goal there is to make
sure the <a href="/Articles/450286/">Contiguous Memory
Allocator (CMA)</a>, <a href="/Articles/474819/">dma-buf</a>,
and other buffer sharing approaches are compatible with both general Linux
and Android Linux.  
<p>
Dima Zavin (Google) clarified that ION is focused on
standardizing the user-space interface, allowing different approaches
required by different hardware to work, while avoiding the need to
re-implement the same logic over and over for each device. The really hard
part of buffer sharing is sorting out how to allocate buffers that satisfy
all the constraints of the different hardware that will need to access
those buffers. For Android,
the constraints are constant per-device, so they can be statically decided,
but for more generic Linux systems there may need to be some run-time
detection of what devices a buffer might be shared with, possibly
converting buffer types when a incompatible buffer interacts with a
constrained bit of hardware for the first time. 
There are some conflicting
needs here as Android is very focused on constant performance, and
per-device optimizations allow that, whereas the more general proposed
solution might have occasional performance costs, requiring buffers to be
occasionally copied. 
<p>
The ION work is still under development, and hasn't
yet been submitted to the kernel mailing list, but Hiroshi pointed out that a
number of folks are actively working on integrating the dma-buf and CMA
work with ION, thus there is a need for a point where discussion and
collaboration can be done. As it seems the ION work won't move upstream or
into staging immediately, it's likely the <a
href="http://lists.linaro.org/mailman/listinfo/linaro-mm-sig">linaro-mm-sig
mailing list</a> will be the central collaboration point.</p>
<p>
<h4>Ashmem &amp; the Alarm driver</h4>

<p>The next topic, was <a href="http://elinux.org/Android_Kernel_Features#ashmem">ashmem</a>, which John Stultz (Linaro/IBM) has been
working on. He helped get the ashmem patches reworked and merged into
staging, and is now working on pulling the pinning/unpinning feature from
ashmem out of the driver and pushing it a little more deeply into the VM
subsystem via the <a href="/Articles/468896/">fadvise volatile
interface</a>. The effort is still under development, but there have been a
number of positive comments on the general idea of the feature. 
<p>
The current
discussion with the code on linux-kernel is around how to best store the
volatile 
ranges efficiently, and some of the behavior around coalescing neighboring
volatile ranges. In addition there have been requests by Andrew Morton to
find a way to reuse the range storage structure with the POSIX file locking
code, which has similar requirements. This effort wouldn't totally replace
the ashmem driver, as the ashmem driver also provides a way to get unlinked
tmpfs file descriptors without having tmpfs mounted, but it would greatly
shrink the 
ashmem code, making it more of a thin "Android compatibility driver", which
would hopefully be more palatable upstream.</p>

<p>John then covered the Android Alarm Driver feature, which he had worked
on partially upstreaming with the <a
href="/Articles/429925/">virtualized RTC and POSIX
alarm_timers</a> work last year. John has refactored the Android Alarm
driver and has submitted it for staging in 3.4; he also has a patch
queue ready which carves out chunks of the Android Alarm driver and
converts it to using the upstreamed alarm_timers. To be sure regressions
are not introduced, this conversion will likely be done slowly, so that any
minor behavioral differences between the Android alarm infrastructure and
the upstreamed infrastructure can be detected and corrected as
needed. Further, the upstream POSIX alarm user interfaces are not
completely sufficient to replace the Android Alarm driver, due to how it
interacts with wakelocks, but this patch set will greatly reduce the alarm
driver, and from there we can see if it would either be appropriate to
preserve this smaller Android specific interface, or try to integrate the
functionality into the timerfd code.</p>
<p>
<h4>Low memory killer &amp; interactive cpufreq governor</h4>
<p>
As Anton
Vorontsov (Linaro) could not attend, John covered Anton's work on improving
the low memory killer in the staging tree as well as his plans to
re-implement the low memory killer in user space using a low-memory notifier
interface to signal the Android Activity Manager. There is wider interest
in the community in a low-memory notifier interface, and a number of
different approaches have been proposed, using both control groups (with
the memory controller) or
simpler character device drivers.
<p>
The Android developers expressed concern that if the killing logic is
pushed out to the Activity Manager, it would have to be locked into memory
and the 
killing path would have to be very careful not to cause any memory
allocations, which is difficult with Dalvik applications.  Without this
care, if memory is
very tight, the killing logic itself could be blocked waiting for memory,
causing the situation to only get worse. Pushing the killing logic into its
own memory-locked task which was then carefully written not to trigger memory
allocations would be needed, and the Android developers weren't excited
about adding another long-lived daemon to the system. John acknowledged
those concerns, but, as Anton is fairly passionate about this
approach, he will likely continue his prototyping in order to get hard
numbers to show any extra costs or benefits to the user-space approach.</p>

<p>Anton had also recently pushed out the <a
href="/Articles/480010/">Android "interactive cpufreq
governor"</a> to linux-kernel for discussion.  Due to a general desire in the
community not to add any more cpufreq code, it seems the patches won't be
going in as-is.  Instead it was suggested that the P-state policy should be
in the scheduler itself, using the soon-to-land average load tracking code,
so Anton will be doing further research there. There was also a question
raised whether the ondemand cpufreq governor would not now be sufficient,
as a number of bugs relating to the sampling period had been resolved in
the last year. The Android developers did not have any recent data on
ondemand, but suggested Anton get in touch with Todd Poyner at Google as he
is the current owner of the code on their side.</p>
<p>
<h4>Items of difficulty</h4>

<p>Having covered most of the active work, folks discussed which items
might be too hard to ever get upstream.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://elinux.org/Android_Security#Paranoid_network-ing">paranoid
network interface</a>, which hard-fixes device permissions to 
specific group IDs, is clearly not generic enough to be able to go
upstream. Arnd Bergmann (Linaro/IBM) however commented that network
namespaces could be used to provide very similar functionality. The
Android developers were very interested in this, but Arnd warned that the
existing documentation is narrowly scoped and will likely be lacking to
help them do exactly what they want. The Android developers said they would
look into it.</p>

<p>The binder driver also was brought up as a difficult bit of code to
get included into mainline officially. The Android developers expressed
their sympathy as it is a large chunk of code with a long history, and they
themselves have tried unsuccessfully to implement alternatives. However,
the specific behavior and performance characteristics of binder are very
useful for their systems. Arnd made the good point that there is something
of a parallel to SysV IPC. The Linux community would never design something
like SysV IPC, and generally has a poor opinion of it, but it does support
SysV IPC to allow applications that need it to function. Something like
this sort 
of a rationale might be persuasive to get binder merged officially, once
the code has been further cleaned up.</p>

<p>At this point, after 4 hours of discussion, the focus started to
fray. John showed a demo of the benefit of the Android drivers landing in
staging, with an AOSP build of Android 4.0 running on a vanilla 3.3-rc3
kernel with only few lines of change. Dima then showed off a very cool
debugging tool for their latest devices. With a headphone plug on one end
and USB on the other, he showed off how the headphone jack on the phone
can do double duty as a serial port allowing for debug access. With this,
excited side conversations erupted. Tim finally thanked everyone for
attending and suggested we do this again sometime soon, personal and
development schedules allowing.</p>
<p>

This is more or less industry standard for many, many years.  It goes back way into feature phones, e.g. look at the Compal/Motorola C1xx phones or the "Motorola T191 cable".<br>

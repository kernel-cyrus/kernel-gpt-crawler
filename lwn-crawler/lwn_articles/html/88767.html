When a kernel development project lives outside of the mainline kernel tree
for a long time, it often picks up its own coding conventions which do not
always match well with the kernel as a whole.  One such project is the ALSA
sound system, which was developed independently for years until it reached
a state where it seemed ready to replace the old OSS drivers; it was merged
in 2.5.  Now some of the kernel developers are taking a look at the ALSA
code and finding things which would, most likely, not have survived for
long had ALSA been an in-tree development from the beginning.

<p>

One of those is the ALSA convention for dealing with driver-private data.
Many structures and callbacks in the kernel support the passing of private
data; this is accomplished by way of a <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> pointer.
Creators and users of private data passed in this way are responsible for
knowing what kind of structure is being dealt with and performing the
appropriate casts.  In general, this mechanism works well; there have been
very few bugs resulting from confusion over the type of a private data
pointer. 

<p>
Even so, 
the ALSA developers took some extra steps to ensure that errors do not
creep in when private data is passed around; their conventions are <a
href="http://www.alsa-project.org/~iwai/writing-an-alsa-driver/x254.htm#CARD-MANAGEMENT-CHIP-WHAT-ADVANTAGE">documented</a>
in the ALSA driver writing manual.  In brief, it works as follows.  The
first step is to define a structure to be used as private data, create a
type for it, and assign a magic number; the code tends to look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef struct { /* ... */ } funky_struct_t;
    #define funky_struct_t_magic 0x19980122
</pre>
<p>
The value of the magic number is arbitrary (but should be unique); the name
must match the defined type of the structure, however.
<p>
When one of these structures is to be allocated, one of the following
macros must
be used:
<p>
<pre>
    void *snd_magic_kmalloc(type, unsigned int extra-data, 
                            unsigned int flags);
    void *snd_magic_kcalloc(type, unsigned int extra-data, 
                            unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The second version simply zeroes out the memory before returning it.  Both
versions allocate some extra space to store the magic number, thus
identifying the allocated memory as holding a structure of the given type.
<p>
When one of these structures is to be obtained from a <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt>
private data pointer, the cast must be done in a special way:
<p>
<pre>
    funky_struct_t *mydata;
    mydata = snd_magic_cast(funky_struct_t, void_pointer, return -ESCREWEDUP);
</pre>
<p>
This macro will ensure that the types match; the final parameter is a line
of C code to be executed should a mismatch occur.  There is also, of
course, a <tt>snd_magic_kfree()</tt> for freeing these structures.
<p>
Attention was recently drawn to these conventions as part of an unrelated
critique of the ALSA code.  The kernel hackers, as a whole, do not like
the "<tt>snd_magic_</tt>" macros; they feel that the rest of the kernel has
gotten by just fine without that sort of infrastructure.  It has also been
noted that this kind of checking, if it is determined to be useful, should
really be part of the central memory allocator rather than being specific
to one subsystem.  
<p>
In response to the discussion, one energetic hacker has already sent out <a
href="/Articles/88778/">a set of patches</a> removing most of the ALSA
"magic" framework.  ALSA maintainer Jaroslav Kysela has <a
href="/Articles/88779/">requested</a> that they not be applied at this time, however;
the ALSA team would like to figure out how best to clean up that code on
its own.  This effort may involve simply removing it, or <a
href="/Articles/88788/">replacing it</a> with a less "magic" mechanism.
One way or another, the ALSA code in the future will likely look more like
the rest of the kernel than it does now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      In the light of recent kernel vulns:<p>How much performance does this suck, or rather, how much would it cost if the global allocator would support this scheme?<p>If it's not too expensive (might well be, I don't read lkml), wouldn't it be better to use it and get a bit more safety into the kernel?

      Private data structures are mostly allocated at driver load or open time, so I guess there's not much of a performance penalty.<br>
<p>
However, you need to keep the magic number around, too, so the kernel again gets a bit larger. You'd say this is unneeded bloat, since kernel code should be error free :-)<br>

      Consider the following interface:<p>  struct funky;  // forward decl<p>  struct funky * funky_alloc (void);<p>  void funky_dealloc (struct funky *);<p>  int funky_dowhatever (struct funky *);<p>No magic, just C.  The structure is private. All the user sees is pointers but the pointers are typed so the compiler can do the &quot;magic&quot; checking.  Keep it simple.<br>

      This adds a lot of bloat. First, you introduce an own alloc and free function for each used struct. And further more, you completely break what was intended: to check pointers that were passed along from generic subsystem code. These are shipped as void * pointers, and void * always "works" with other non-void pointers...<br>

<h1>Persistent storage for a kernel's &quot;dying breath&quot;</h1>

<p>
When Linux systems crash, there are various ways to find out what went
wrong, but generally those rely on writing to log files on
disk.  For some systems, disk may not be available, or trusted in the case
of a crash, so a way to poke some data into a platform-specific place for
use by 
a subsequent kernel boot would be useful.  That's exactly what the <a
href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.commits.head/289849">pstore
filesystem</a>, which was just added during the current 2.6.39 merge
window, will provide.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/8273/">idea
for 
pstore</a> came out of a conversation between Tony Luck and Thomas Gleixner
at last year's Linux Plumbers Conference.  Luck wanted to use the ACPI
error record serialization table (ERST) to store crash information across a
reboot. The ERST is a mechanism specified by the <a
href="http://www.acpi.info/DOWNLOADS/ACPIspec40a.pdf">ACPI specification
[PDF]</a> (in section 17.4, page 519) that allows saving and retrieving
hardware error information to and from
a non-volatile location (like flash).
<p>
 Rather than just doing something specific for the x86
architecture, he decided to create a more general framework so that other
platforms could use whatever persistent storage they had available.  It
would be, as Luck put, "<q>a generic 
layer for persistent storage usable to pass tens or hundreds
of kilobytes of data from the dying breath of a crashing
kernel to its successor</q>".

</blockquote>
<p>
There have been a number of iterations of the code since Luck first posted
it for comments back in November.  After Alan Cox's <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/8280">suggestion</a>,
pstore moved from its original firmware driver with a sysfs interface
to a more straightforward filesystem-based implementation.

<p>
The basic idea is that a platform can register the availability of a
persistent storage location with a call to <tt>pstore_register()</tt> and
pass a pointer to a <tt>struct pstore_info</tt>, which looks like:
<pre>
    struct pstore_info {
	    struct module   *owner;
	    char            *name;
	    struct mutex    buf_mutex;      /* serialize access to 'buf' */
	    char            *buf;
	    size_t          bufsize;
	    size_t          (*read)(u64 *id, enum pstore_type_id *type,
			    struct timespec *time);
	    u64             (*write)(enum pstore_type_id type, size_t size);
	    int             (*erase)(u64 id);
    };
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The platform driver needs to provide three I/O routines and a buffer. There
is also a mutex present to protect against simultaneous access to the
buffer. With that, pstore
will implement a 
filesystem that can be accessed from the kernel&mdash;or from user space once
it has been mounted. The underlying ERST storage is record oriented, and
Luck posits that other platform storage areas will be also, so the I/O
interface is record oriented as well.
</p>

<p>
 In addition to
the pstore framework, the ERST driver was <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.commits.head/289854/match=pstore">modified
to take advantage of pstore</a>; that change was also merged, so there is
an in-kernel user of pstore.  The <tt>pstore_info</tt> buffer is allocated
and managed by <tt>drivers/acpi/apei/erst.c</tt>, and is larger than the
<tt>bufsize</tt> advertised to account for the record and section headers
required by ERST.  Users of the IO interface either fill the buffer before
 calling <tt>pstore_info.write()</tt> or read the data from the buffer
 after a call to <tt>pstore_info.read()</tt>.

<p>
Each item is stored with a type, either <tt>PSTORE_TYPE_DMESG</tt> for log
messages (likely oops output), <tt>PSTORE_TYPE_MCE</tt> for hardware
errors, or <tt>PSTORE_TYPE_UNKNOWN</tt> for other undefined types.  When
stored, each item gets a record ID associated with it, which gets returned
from the <tt>pstore_info.write()</tt> call.  That ID can then be used in
<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>erase()</tt> operations, but it also appears in the
filenames in the pstore filesystem.
</p>

<p>
The filesystem can be mounted using:
<pre>
    # mount -t pstore - /dev/pstore
</pre>
Files will appear there with names based on the type, name of the storage
driver, and the id, so the first dmesg record for ERST would be
<tt>/dev/pstore/dmesg-erst-1</tt>.  The typical scenario would be for the
filesystem to be mounted at boot time, then some user-space process would
check for any files there, copy them to some more permanent place, and
delete the files with <tt>rm</tt>.  That will allow the storage facility
driver to reclaim the space in order to be ready for other crashes or
hardware errors.
</p>

<p>
By default, pstore will register a dump handler with kmsg_dump to write the
last 10K bytes of data from the kernel log to the pstore device when there
is a kernel oops or panic.  The amount of data to store can be configured
at mount time using the <tt>kmsg_bytes</tt> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Luck has also put out an <a href="/Articles/434918/">RFC patch</a> to
disable dumping information into pstore for some kinds of kmsg_dump reasons
(e.g. <tt>KMSG_DUMP_HALT</tt> or <tt>KMSG_DUMP_RESTART</tt>), but various
other developers weren't so sure.  Seiji Aguchi pointed to two use cases
(<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/17/249">1</a>, <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/23/325">2</a>) he has found for needing
to store the tail of the kernel log messages in most of those cases. In
addition, Artem Bityutskiy <a href="/Articles/434920/">pointed out</a> that
having pstore decide which kmsg_dump reasons to handle "<q>smells like
policy in the kernel</q>".  Adding more options to control that behavior
is certainly possible, but Luck seems to be of a mind to <a
href="/Articles/434921/">wait a bit</a> before making any change.
</p>

<p>
There are other persistent storage methods for kernel log messages,
notably <tt>devices/mtd/mtdoops.c</tt> and <tt>devices/char/ramoops.c</tt>.
But those are targeted at the 
embedded space where NVRAM devices are prevalent or for platforms where RAM
can be reserved that will not be cleared on a restart.  Pstore is more
flexible, as it can store more than just kernel logs, while the two
<tt>*oops</tt> devices are wired into storing the output of kmsg_dump.
</p>

<p>
Now that pstore has been merged, others will likely start using it.  David
Miller has already <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/8275/">indicated</a>
that he will use it for sparc64, where a region of memory can be set aside
to persist across reboots.  One would guess that other architectures that
have hardware support for similar mechanisms will as well.

Not reliably, no. The only persistent storage that's guaranteed on a BIOS-based PC is the real time clock, and there's not really enough space there. EFI actually helps here(!), although right now we don't implement the bits of the spec that cover this.<br>

If the vendor provided storage for ERST, then pstore would work on a normal PC.<br>
<p>
If no hardware storage is available, the next best option is to use "kexec -p" to set up a recovery kernel that uses kexec to take over on a panic.  The init scripts can then be modified to detect when they're running under the recovery kernel, and they can just dumps the original kernel memory to disk and then reboot.<br>

The article reminded me about some very old article of writing oopses to a block device, like swap. At then the conclusion was that it isn't wise since a block device might be at stage of mayhem and there is data at stake. Still I find it appealing, that there could be a block driver for pstore and it is at sysadmin's choice to use it or not. The block driver could be configured to use a USB-storage or whatever storage auxiliary to data storage. I guess the main point is that the sysadmin is very very aware to place the pstore behind some other subsystem than the system's main storage.<br>

      <p>A while ago LWN explained a proposal of <a href="/Articles/108595/">using kexec to debug crashes</a>. One prepares a crashdump kernel in some reserved memory area, and when the system crashes, it kexecs into the new kernel which can then write back a big core dump of the crashed kernel. Here are the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt">kdump docs</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like both kernels could be extended to dump and read logs in some ram area, which doesn't require hardware support and could be a fallback when there is no persistent area for pstore. Those logs can then be read without requiring kernel debug symbols or a kernel hacker to make sense of the kdump image.

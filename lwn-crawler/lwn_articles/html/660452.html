           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>October 21, 2015</br>
           </div>
<p>
Back in late September, we <a href="/Articles/658497/">looked</a> at a
patch to improve the scalability of random number generation on Linux
systems—large NUMA systems, in particular.  While the proposed change
solved the immediate scalability problem, there were some downsides to that
approach, in terms of both complexity and security.  Some more recent
discussion has come up with other possibilities for solving the problem.
</p>

<p>
The original idea came from Andi Kleen; it changed the kernel's non-blocking
random number pool into a set of pools, one per NUMA node.  That would
prevent a spinlock on a single pool from becoming a bottleneck.  But it also
made the kernel's random number subsystem more complex.   In addition, it
spread the 
available entropy over all of the pools, effectively dividing the amount
available to users on any given node by the number of pools.
</p>

<p>
But, as George Spelvin <a href="/Articles/660740/">noted</a>, the entropy
in a pool is "<q>not located in any
particular bit position</q>", but is distributed throughout the
pool—entropy is a "<q>holographic property of the pool</q>", as he
put it.  That means that multiple readers do not need to be serialized by a
spinlock as long as each gets a unique <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29">salt</a> value
that ensures
that the random numbers produced are different.  Spelvin suggested using
the CPU ID for the salt; each reader hashes the salt in with the pool to
provide a unique random number even if the pool is in the same state for
each read.
</p>

<p>
Spelvin provided a patch using that approach along with his comments.
Random number subsystem maintainer Ted Ts'o
<a href="/Articles/661422/">agreed</a> with Spelvin about how the entropy
is distributed, but had some different ideas on how to handle mixing the
random numbers generated back into the pool.  He also provided a patch and
asked
Kleen to benchmark his approach. "<q>I really hope it will be good
enough, since besides 
using less memory, there are security advantages in not spreading the
entropy across N pools.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Either approach would eliminate the lock contention (and cache-line
bouncing of the 
lock), but there still may be performance penalties for sharing the pool
among multiple cores due to cache coherency.  The non-blocking pool changes
frequently, 
either as data gets mixed in from the input pool (which is shared with the
blocking 
pool) or as data that is read from the pool gets mixed back in to make it
harder to predict its state.  The cache lines of the pool will be
bounced around between the cores, which may well be less than desirable.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, when Kleen ran his micro-benchmark, both patch sets
<a href="/Articles/661457/">performed poorly</a> in comparison to the
multi-pool approach.  In fact, for 
reasons unknown, Spelvin's was worse than the existing implementation.

<p>
Meanwhile, while the benchmarking was taking place, Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/661380/">pointed out</a> that it may just
make sense to recognize when a process is "abusing" <tt>getrandom()</tt> or
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt> and to switch it to using its own cryptographic-strength
random number generator (CSRNG or CRNG) seeded from the non-blocking pool.  That
way, uncommon—or, more likely, 
extremely rare—workloads won't force changes to the core of the Linux
random number generator.  Ts'o is hoping to not add any more complexity
into the random subsystem:
<div class="BigQuote">
At this point, I wonder if it might not be simpler to restrict the
current nonblocking pool to kernel users, and for userspace users, the
first time a process reads from /dev/urandom or calls getrandom(2), we
create for them a ChaCha20 CRNG, which hangs off of the task
structure.  This would require about 72 bytes of state per process,
but normally very few processes are reading from /dev/urandom or
calling getrandom(2) from userspace.
<p>
The CRNG would be initialized from the non-blocking pool, and is
reseeded after, say, 2**24 cranks or five minutes.  It's essentially
an OpenBSD-style arc4random in the kernel.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Spelvin was <a href="/Articles/661445/">concerned</a> that the CSRNG
solution would make long-running servers susceptible to backtracking: using
the current state of the generator to determine random numbers that have
been produced earlier.  If backtracking protection can be discarded, there
can be even simpler solutions, he said, including: "<q>just have *one* key for the kernel, reseeded more
often, and a per-thread nonce and stream position.</q>"  But Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/661454/">said</a> that anti-backtracking was not being
completely abandoned, just relaxed:  "<q>We are
discarding backtracking protection between successive reads from a
single process, and even there we would be reseeding every five
minutes (and this could be tuned), so there is *some*
anti-backtracking protection.</q>"

<p>
Furthermore, he suggested that perhaps real abusers could get their own
CSRNG output, while non-abusers would still get output from the
non-blocking pool:
<div class="BigQuote">
On the flip side, the time when you might care about anti-backtracking
protection is say, when you're generating a new session key for a new
connection.  So perhaps one approach is to use some kind of
ratelimiter algorithm so that if you're using /dev/urandom "carefully"
(say, no more than ten times a second), we'll use the non-blocking
pool.  But once a process exceeds that limit, it will switch over the
the CRNG, and then the only performance that abuser process will hurt
is its own (because it would be even faster if they were running
something like arc4random in userspace).
</div>
</p>

<p>
Spelvin had suggested adding another random "device" (perhaps
<tt>/dev/frandom</tt>) to provide the output of a CSRNG directly to user
space, because he was concerned about changing the semantics of
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt> and <tt>getrandom()</tt> by introducing the
possibility of backtracking.  But he agreed that changing the behavior for
frequent heavy readers/callers would not change the semantics since the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/random.4.html">random(4) man
page</a> explicitly warns against that kind of usage:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] so if any program reads more than 256 bits (32 bytes) from the kernel
       random pool per invocation, or per reasonable reseed interval (not
       less than one minute), that should be taken as a sign that its
       cryptography is not skillfully implemented.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Spelvin posted another <a href="/Articles/661025/">patch set</a> that
pursues his ideas on improving the scalability of generating random
numbers.  It focuses on the reducing the lock contention when the output of
the pool is mixed back into the pool to thwart
backtracking (known as a mixback operation).  If there are 
multiple concurrent readers for the non-blocking pool, Spelvin's patch set
ensures that one of them causes a mixback operation; others that come
along while a mixback lock is held simply write their data into a global
mixback buffer, which then gets incorporated into the mixback operation that
is done by the lock holder when releasing the lock.
</p>

<p>
There has been no comment on those patches so far, but one gets the sense
that Ts'o (or someone) will try to route around the whole scalability
problem with a separate CSRNG for abusers.  That would leave the current
approach intact, while still providing a scalable solution for those who
are, effectively, inappropriately using the non-blocking pool.  Ts'o seemed
strongly in favor of that approach, so it seems likely to prevail.
Kleen has
<a href="/Articles/661580/">asked</a> that his multi-pool approach be
merged, since "<q>it works and is actually scalable
and does not require any new 'cryptographic research' or other
risks</q>".  But it is not clear that the complexity and (slightly) reduced
security of that approach will pass muster.

Probably worth noting that gnupg reads quite a lot more than 256 bits from /dev/random. IIRC it reads the full size of the key it's generating.<br>

I would strongly prefer that /dev/random and /dev/urandom always provide the highest-quality randomness possible, even if it is slow.  I do not want to downgrade the security of my encryption keys to cater to the abuses of a few misbehaving programs.  If those programs run too slowly, then either add another random device for them with different sematics (e.g. /dev/prandom), or convert them to use their own userspace CSRNG.<br>

      <p>The concerns about "backtracking" (and the overall concerns about the "quality" of randomness from random/urandom/csprng) are very much overstated.</p>

<p>In particular, if ChaCha20 was vulnerable to backtracking, that would be exactly equivalent to a known-plaintext key-recovery attack, which would mean it was completely broken as a stream cipher. That's not a realistic concern.</p>

<p>(Equivalence: In a stream cipher, the keystream is XORed with the plaintext to generate the output. If the plaintext is known, it can be XORed again to recover the <em>used</em> portion of the keystream. However, using that to predict future output would be a complete break, and in any stream cipher is insufficient - you must instead use what keystream you recovered to figure out the key, which is exactly what a cipher is designed to defend against.)</p>

The main concerns with making an RNG are:
<ul>
<li>Insufficient access to <em>sources</em> of entropy</li>
<ul>
<li> This is distinct from insufficient access to <em>entropy</em> - only the kernel has access to certain data, such as disk timings. Thus, implementing an RNG in userspace is a real tradeoff, as you either sacrifice exactly the speed you sought to gain by reseeding with syscalls more frequently, or sacrifice security by not doing so.</li>
</ul>
<li>Poor implementation</li>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is hard. Secure crypto is harder. See also: Debian's changes to OpenSSL's random implementation, OpenSSL's SILENTLY falling back to a horrendously bad RNG if it can't use the system one, etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Primitive choice</li>
<ul>
<li>Choosing the correct building blocks for an RNG is important as well - in fact, the current Linux RNG, based on a very ad-hoc construction using SHA-1, half-MD4, etc, has been criticized on these grounds with <strong><em>detectable biases</em></strong> as a result. ChaCha20 is a superior primitive for deriving a stream from the pool than Linux' random currently uses, as a matter of fact: Better statistical behavior, far better security analysis, and better speed.</li>
</ul>

I'm in this camp; I would rather see the existing interfaces left alone, and then a new /dev/frandom device provided for people who need mass quantities of semi-random bits. (like for disk wiping).  <br>
<p>
I presently use urandom for that, which I have just learned today is something I'm not supposed to be doing.  That's fine, but I'd rather see a facility for doing what I'm doing (using a flood of semi-random data as a drive wiper), rather than seeing urandom weakened in any way.   <br>
<p>
Yes, I'm a urandom abuser, and probably deserve a hearty finger shake and a tsk or two, but I think trying to defend against scurrilous people like me, by changing the quality of the bits provided, could be a really severe hidden issue.  People truly depend on that stuff, and it's quite possible that predictable output from /dev/urandom could end up killing someone.  No hyperbole there....  if a repressive government known for mass surveillance is able to break into privileged communications that depended on the strength of /dev/urandom, both parties could be executed.  <br>
<p>
Further, it's going to be real hard to test from outside, and as a user of bits, you'd want some kind of signal that you were no longer getting ones with the same guarantee anymore.  I don't even know how you'd do that.  And writing test cases to make sure that it was doing what it was supposed to do, under all circumstances, would be very hard, and testing the heuristic 'only punish abusers' code would be almost impossible.  <br>
<p>
/dev/urandom is understood to not be as good as /dev/random, and people aren't *supposed* to use it for really important stuff, but they might be doing it anyway.  I'd say preserving existing guarantees is probably more important than scalability.  Rather, switch jerks like me to the ChaCha20 cipher with /dev/frandom.  I'd be perfectly happy to switch (and could probably wipe drives a fair bit faster, to boot.) <br>
<p>
That just seems safest on every front.  The random pools are NOT things to screw around with lightly.  <br>

Not quite; "abuser" is being used very loosely on the ML.<br>

<p>
Thinking that the proposed idea would weaken urandom is "correct" in the same way as thinking that because ZFS uses 128-bit sizing it's less likely to run out of space on your computer than ext4 which uses 64-bit sizing: the math is correct, but the actual expenditure needed to even approach it being _relevant_ is so unrealistic in terms of *physics* as to be laughable.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; People truly depend on that stuff, and it's quite possible that predictable output from /dev/urandom could end up killing someone.</font><br>
<p>
Considering that ChaCha20 has exactly the same weight on its shoulders, this is again true but irrelevant. (If ChaCha20 is weak in a way that affects using it in urandom, then TLS is in a lot of trouble).<br>

The *existing* Linux RNG is hard to test - incidentally, researchers did it anyway. Turns out it's an ad-hoc mess and makes *worse* guarantees than ChaCha20. Funny, that.<br>

Not only wrong, but *dead* wrong, and actively harmful, to the point of causing vulnerabilities to DOS and other attacks: see <a href="http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/02/25/safely-generate-random-numbers/">http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/02/25/safely-generate-ran...</a><br>

Cryptographers have long-since come to the conclusion that entropy estimation _doesn't work_ worth a damn, and the only difference between /dev/urandom and /dev/random is that the latter blocks based on entropy estimation.<br>

      Just this week, Google's Adam Langley <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2015/10/17/boringssl.html">described details</a> of BoringSSL&nbsp;&ndash; and it uses <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> for all of its randomness needs, without any additional CSPRNG&hellip; So now it looks like <em>all</em> of Google's servers, as well as all Android devices, will be constantly &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; the entropy pool.

Samba has now also chosen do take this approach.  We had a RC4-based PRNG we held in userspace, but chose to remove it as it was slow, complex and required tracking across fork() etc.  These risks are avoided by trusting the Kernel.  I would far rather we had one, good, kernel-based PRNG that can handle fork() without special work than 100s of poorly implemented userspace PRNG implementations looking for another Debian-OpenSSL disaster.<br>
<p>
That is, read() of /dev/urandom is really easy to audit, and a call to the new getentropy() call will be even easier, while userspace PRNG systems are really hard. <br>

<p>
Speaking of that person, they're an alluring mystery to me. "George Spelvin" is a common pseudonym used in american theater [1]. The developer has been around for a long time and is clearly of high skill. For example, this post [2] where they improve the assembly implementation of SHA1 on PPC... without access to the HW! They used to only go by their email address, linux@horizon.com.<br>
<p>
Has anyone else been intrigued, and/or have more info about this anonymous hacker?<br>

Or, better yet, we could discard the entire notion of the "entropy pool" beyond ensuring that we have enough entropy at startup to seed one or more CSPRNGs.  The CS in CSPRNG stands for "cryptographically secure".<br>

Yes, but what's not included in that acronym is *believed* secure.  A breakthrough by a sufficiently clever mathematician could change that overnight.  <br>

There probably aren't going to be any math breakthroughs that change measurements of user interactions on a microsecond scale. <br>

Just two days ago, I tried to deploy an app on a virtual server using tomcat7. It wouldn't work because not enough entropy was available. Apparently the miserable thing reads something from /dev/random, and despite the RDRAND instruction was available on the server, it still wouldn't work, I guess because it wouldn't use it. Looking at dmesg, I saw that the kernel reported collecting like 16 bits of entropy after 2 seconds, and that it took full 24 seconds to merely collect enough entropy to start urandom. The mind boggles. Here we have capability to generate literally gigabytes of perfectly random data using instruction dedicated for the purpose, and yet... we don't.<br>

If you've got RDRAND available, you should probably have rngd running to pipe it into /dev/random.<br>

RDRAND is generated by a CSPRNG running on the chip, so it's probably not suitable for that purpose.  Broadwell and newer processors add a new RDSEED instruction, which supposedly reads more or less directly from the hardware RNG.  <br>
<p>
It's probably no more trustworthy than RDRAND in terms of the NSA's influence, but if you believe that they do what Intel claims, then RDSEED would be a good source to pipe back into the kernel, where RDRAND is of much lower quality. <br>

Crypto community is scared of RDRAND. It's widely-deployed proprietary RNG hardware that NSA has a large incentive to backdoor. Anyone who knows for certain whether it has been isn't going to say anything.<br>

Also, it's a nice bonus at best if a JVM uses anything platform specific.<br>

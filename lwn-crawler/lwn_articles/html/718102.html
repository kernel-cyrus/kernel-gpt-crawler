When the transparent huge page feature was added to the kernel, it only
supported anonymous (non-file-backed) memory.  In 2016, <a
href="/Articles/686690/">support for huge pages in the page cache</a> was
added, but only the tmpfs filesystem was supported.  There is interest in
expanding support to other filesystems, since, for some workloads, the
performance improvement can be significant.  Kirill Shutemov led the only
session that combined just the filesystem and memory-management tracks at
the 2017 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit in a
discussion of adding huge-page support to the ext4 filesystem.
<p>
He started by saying that the tmpfs support works well now, so it's time to
take the next step and support a real filesystem.  <a
href="/Articles/619514/">Compound pages</a> are used to represent huge
pages in the system memory map; the first of the range of (small) pages
that makes up a huge page is the head page, while the rest are tail pages.
Most of the important metadata is stored in the head page.  Using compound
pages allows the entire huge page to be represented by a single entry in
the least-recently-used (LRU) lists, and all buffer-head structures, if
any, are tied to the head page.  Unlike DAX, he said, transparent huge
pages do not force any constraints on a file's on-disk layout.
<p>
With tmpfs, he said, the creation of a huge page causes the addition of 512
(single-page) entries to the radix tree; this cannot work in ext4.  It is
also necessary to add DAX support and to make it work consistently.  There

<a href="/Articles/718103/"><img

title="Kirill Shutemov" class="rthumb"></a>

are a few other problems; for example, readahead doesn't currently work
with huge pages.  The maximum size of the readahead window is 128KB, far
less than the size of a huge page.  He was not sure if that was a big deal
or not but, if it is, it will need to be fixed.  Huge pages also cause any
<a href="/Articles/495543/">shadow entries</a> in the page cache to be
ignored, which could worsen the system's page-reclaim decisions.
<p>
He emphasized that huge pages need to avoid breaking existing semantics.
That means that it will be necessary to fall back to small pages at times.
Page migration was one example of when that can happen.  A related problem
is that a lot of system calls provide 4KB resolution, and that can
interfere with huge-page use.  Use of encryption in ext4 will also force a
fallback to small pages.
<p>
Given all that, he asked, is there any reason not to pursue the addition of
huge-page support to ext4?  He has patches that have been circulating for a
while; his current plan is to rebase them onto the current <a
href="/Articles/712467/">page cache work</a> and repost them.
<p>
Jan Kara asked if there was a need to push knowledge of huge pages into
every filesystem, adding complexity, or if it might be possible for
filesystems to always work with small pages.  Shutemov responded that this
is not always an option.  There is, for example, a single up-to-date flag
for the entire compound page.  It makes sense to work to make the
abstractions cleaner and hide the differences whenever possible, and he has
been doing that, but the solution is not always obvious.
<p>
Kara continued, saying that there needs to be some sort of proper data
structure for tracking sub-page state.  The kernel currently uses a list of
buffer-head structures, but that could perhaps be changed.  There might be
an advantage to finer-grained tracking.  But he repeated that he doesn't
see a reason why filesystems should need to know about the size of pages as
stored in the page cache, and that teaching every filesystem about a
variably sized page cache will be a significant effort.  Shutemov agreed
with the concern, but said that the right approach is to create an
implementation for a single filesystem, get it working, then try to create
abstractions from there.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox, instead, complained that the current work only supports two
page sizes, while he would like it to handle any compound page size.
Generalizing the code to make that possible, he said, would make the whole
thing cleaner.  The code doesn't have to actually handle every size from
the outset, but it should be prepared for that.
<p>
Trond Myklebust said that he would like to have proper support for huge
pages in the page cache.  In the NFS code, he has to do a lot of looping
and gathering to get up to reasonable block sizes.  Ted Ts'o asked whether
the time had come to split the notion of a page's size (<tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt>)
and the size of data stored in the page cache (<tt>PAGE_CACHE_SIZE</tt>).
The kernel used to treat the two differently, but that distinction was
removed some time ago, resulting in cleaner code.  Wilcox responded that
the meaning of <tt>PAGE_CACHE_SIZE</tt> was never well defined in the past,
and that generalizing the handling of page-cache size is not a cleanup,
it's a performance win.  He suggested it might also make it easier to
support multiple block sizes in ext4, though Shutemov was quick to add that
he couldn't promise that.
<p>
The problem with larger block sizes, Ts'o said, comes about when a process
takes a fault on a 4KB page, and the filesystem needs to bring in a larger
block.  This has never been easy.  The filesystem people say it's a
memory-management problem, while the memory-management people point their
finger at filesystems.  This situation has stayed this way for a long time,
he said.  Wilcox said he wants it to be a memory-management problem; his
work to support variable-sized pages in the page cache should address much
of it.  
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli said that the real problem happens when larger pages are
not available for allocation.  The transparent huge pages code is careful
to never require such allocations; it will always fall back to smaller
pages.  He would not like to see that change.  Instead, he said, the real
solution is to increase the base page size.  Rik van Riel answered that, if
the page cache contains more large pages, they will be available for
reclaim and should be easier to allocate than they are now.
<p>
As the session closed, Ts'o observed that the required changes are much
larger on the memory-management side than on the ext4 side.  If the group
is happy with this work, perhaps it's time to merge it with the idea that
the remaining issues can be fixed up
later.  Or, perhaps, it's better to try to further evolve the interfaces
first.  It is, he said, more of a memory-management decision, so he will
defer to that group.  Shutemov said that the page-cache
interface is the hardest part; he will look at making the interface with
filesystems cleaner.  But, he warned, it doesn't make sense to try to
abstract everything from the outset.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

For supporting block size &gt; PAGE_SIZE, we discussed creating a new data structure that smells a lot like a struct page but represents a set of non-contiguous physical pages. If fragmentation has produced a system which cannot allocate a compound page of the correct size, one could allocate a number of order-0 pages and glue them all together with this new data structure. We would then put a pointer to this new data structure in the page cache. It would behave like a compound page under some circumstances (ie page lookup, locking, reference counts, dirty bit, writeback bit, uptodate bit) but like individual pages under other circumstances (inserting PTEs, kmap(), copy_to/from_iter()).<br>
<p>
The details here are hairy and it's far from a fully baked idea. But with this idea in mind, I think we can go ahead and start implementing arbitrary block size support in the page cache, knowing we have a filesystem-side solution if the MM really can't handle the demands of a large block size FS.<br>
<p>
I think the MM can be made to work; setting watermarks for each in-use block size can help us keep fragmentation under control. Improving our ability to defragment the slab cache is another key component. ZONE_MOVABLE will also help.<br>
<p>
Realistically we're at least a year away from this. There will be plenty to discuss at next year's conference.<br>

During the <a href="/Articles/687511">4.6 development cycle</a>, the
operating performance points (OPP) framework gained the infrastructure to
do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_voltage_scaling">dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)</a> on behalf of device
drivers. This helps in reducing the complexity of those drivers, which
can instead focus on platform-specific details. The rest of this article
discusses what has changed and how can we use it to simplify our device
drivers.
<p>
Until Linux kernel release <a href="/Articles/679931">4.5</a>, the OPP
framework was acting as a helper library that provided a table of
voltage-frequency pairs (with some additional information) for the
kernel. Kernel frameworks, like cpufreq and devfreq, used these OPP tables
to perform DVFS for the devices. The OPP framework creates this table
dynamically via platform-specific code and statically from <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt">device-tree</a>
blobs.

<h4>Operating performance points</h4>

<p>Systems on chips (SoCs)
have become increasingly complex and power-efficient. There are multiple
sub-modules within a SoC that work in conjunction, but not
all of them are required to function at their highest performance 
frequency and voltage levels at all times, as that
can be less power-efficient. Devices like 
CPUs, GPUs, and I/O
devices have the capability of working at a range of frequency and
voltage pairs.  They should stay at lower voltages and frequencies when the
system load is low and at higher levels otherwise.
<p>
The set of discrete tuples consisting of frequency
and voltage pairs that the device supports are called "operating
performance points".
For example, a CPU core that can operate at 1.0GHz at minimum voltage
1.0V, 1.1GHz at minimum voltage 1.1V, and 1.2GHz at minimum voltage 1.3V
can be represented by these OPP tuples:</p> 
<p>
<pre>
    Hz         uV
    1000000000 1000000
    1100000000 1100000
    1200000000 1300000
</pre>

<p>These tuples may contain more configurable values as well, for example voltage
levels for multiple power supplies. The example at the end of this article
shows how the OPP nodes are present in a device tree (DT) blob.</p>

<p>Before  the 4.6 kernel, the OPP framework was responsible for
creating an OPP table by parsing the device tree (or via the
platform-specific code) and providing a set of helpers to inquire about the
target 
OPPs. For example, finding the minimum or maximum OPP corresponding to the
target frequency.
The consumer drivers of the OPP library
used the helpers to find an OPP corresponding to the target frequency and
used it to configure the device's clock and power supplies (if
required).</p>

<h4>What's new</h4>

<p>For the most common configurations (with at most one power supply for the
device), all consumer drivers had pretty much identical DVFS code.  So it
made sense to let the OPP core configure the device to a particular OPP and
simplify the drivers by removing such code from them.
During the 4.6 development cycle, the OPP core thus gained the functionality
to perform DVFS on behalf of device drivers. Those drivers need
to pass a target frequency, and the OPP core will find and set the best
possible OPP corresponding to that.</p>

<p>In order to perform DVFS on behalf of device drivers, the OPP core
needs some of the device's resources. Some of them are acquired
automatically by the OPP core, while the core needs help from the driver to
get others.  It is important for driver writers to understand the
expectations of the OPP core before they try to use it to do DVFS
for their devices.</p>

<p>In order to change the frequency of a device, the OPP core needs the
pointer of the <tt>struct clk</tt> for the device. The OPP core gets this
automatically by calling <tt>clk_get()</tt> using the device's <tt>struct
device</tt> pointer.  The  driver must make sure that
the device has a valid clock registered for it with the clock framework,
otherwise the OPP core will fail to do DVFS for the device.</p>

<p>Voltage scaling isn't always required while doing frequency scaling,
so acquiring the power-supply resources is optional. But for platforms
that need to do voltage scaling, the OPP core needs some input from the
driver. The OPP core supports devices that don't need a
power supply, or that need single or multiple supplies. The 
driver needs to provide the names of all the power supplies to the OPP
core that are required to be configured to perform DVFS for the
device, using:
<p>
<pre>
    struct opp_table *dev_pm_opp_set_regulators(struct device *dev,
    						const char * const names[],
						unsigned int count);
</pre>
<p>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the pointer to the device structure,
<tt>names</tt> is the pointer to an array of power-supply names and
<tt>count</tt> is the number of entries in that array.  This routine
returns a pointer to the <tt>struct opp_table</tt> for the device on
success and an error number (using <tt>ERR_PTR()</tt>) if something goes
wrong. The order in which the names of the power supplies are present in
this array is significant. The OPP core assumes that the entries in the
<tt>opp-microvolt</tt> property in the OPP table in DT will be present in
the same order as in the array. Refer to the example at the end for more on
the <tt>opp-microvolt</tt> property. If this function
isn't called for a device, the OPP core
assumes that the device doesn't need to participate in voltage scaling and
that frequency scaling can be done independently.</p>

<p>The OPP core in turn calls <tt>regulator_get_optional()</tt> for each string
present in 
the <tt>names</tt> array. If the OPP core fails to get the regulator
corresponding
to any of the strings, it returns with an error.

<p>Once the consumer driver is done with the OPP table, it should free the
resources acquired by the OPP core using the following routine:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    void dev_pm_opp_put_regulators(struct opp_table *opp_table);
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>opp_table</tt> is the pointer to the OPP table, earlier returned by
<tt>dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()</tt>.</p>

<p>
<h4>Performing DVFS</h4></p>

<p>Once the OPP core has all the resources it needs to do DVFS for a
device, the consumer drivers can use the helpers described below to let the
OPP core perform DVFS on its behalf. DVFS methods differ a bit depending on
the number of power supplies required to be configured for the device. In
the most common cases, the OPP core either needs to do only frequency
scaling (no power supply) or needs to do voltage scaling for a single
power supply along with it. For such platforms, the driver needs
to call this helper to let the OPP core do DVFS for the device:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    int dev_pm_opp_set_rate(struct device *dev, unsigned long target_freq);
</pre>

<p>Where <tt>dev</tt> is the pointer to the device structure, and
<tt>target_freq</tt> is the frequency we need to program the device
for. This routine configures the device for the OPP 
with the lowest frequency greater than or equal to the target frequency.
This routine returns zero on success
and a negative error number otherwise.</p>

<p>If the device doesn't need to do voltage scaling at all, then
<tt>dev_pm_opp_set_rate()</tt> can be called without calling
<tt>dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()</tt> earlier. Otherwise,
<tt>dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()</tt> must be called successfully before
calling <tt>dev_pm_opp_set_rate()</tt>. If the target OPP has higher
frequency than the current OPP, then <tt>dev_pm_opp_set_rate()</tt> does
voltage scaling before doing frequency scaling.  Otherwise frequency
scaling is done before voltage scaling.</p>

<p>The handling is a bit different in the complex cases where voltage
scaling of multiple power supplies is required. The order in
which multiple power supplies need to be programmed is platform-specific
and it is difficult to come up with common code that can work in all cases.
To simplify things, the OPP core provides the capability
to provide platform-specific <tt>set_opp()</tt> callbacks, which will be
called by the OPP core from within <tt>dev_pm_opp_set_rate()</tt> at the
time of DVFS.  This callback can be registered using:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    struct opp_table *dev_pm_opp_register_set_opp_helper(struct device *dev, 
			  int (*set_opp)(struct dev_pm_set_opp_data *data));
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the pointer to the device structure, and
<tt>set_opp()</tt> is the platform-specific callback. The callback takes
<tt>struct dev_pm_set_opp_data</tt> as argument, which contains all the
configuration the callback needs to do DVFS, and returns zero on success and
negative error number otherwise. This helper returns a pointer to the
<tt>struct opp_table</tt> for the device on success and an error number
(cast as a pointer) if something went wrong.</p>

<p>The platform-specific callback should be unregistered using the following
routine after the driver is done with the OPP table:</p>

<P>
<pre>
    void dev_pm_opp_register_put_opp_helper(struct opp_table *opp_table);
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>opp_table</tt> is the pointer to the OPP table, earlier
returned by <tt>dev_pm_opp_register_set_opp_helper()</tt>.</p>

<h4>Connecting it all together</h4>

<p>Here is an example that connects the dots to explain how it all fits
together. We have two CPU devices here (that share their clock/voltage
rails) and we need to configure a single power supply to perform DVFS for
them.  The device-tree fragment describing the CPUs themselves would be:
<p>
<pre>
	cpus {
		#address-cells = &lt;1&gt;;
		#size-cells = &lt;0&gt;;

		cpu@0 {
			compatible = &quot;arm,cortex-a9&quot;;
			reg = &lt;0&gt;;
			next-level-cache = &lt;&amp;L2&gt;;
			clocks = &lt;&amp;clk_controller 0&gt;;
			clock-names = &quot;cpu&quot;;
			vdd-supply = &lt;&amp;vdd_supply0&gt;;
			operating-points-v2 = &lt;&amp;cpu_opp_table&gt;;
		};

		cpu@1 {
			compatible = &quot;arm,cortex-a9&quot;;
			reg = &lt;1&gt;;
			next-level-cache = &lt;&amp;L2&gt;;
			clocks = &lt;&amp;clk_controller 0&gt;;
			clock-names = &quot;cpu&quot;;
			vdd-supply = &lt;&amp;vdd_supply0&gt;;
			operating-points-v2 = &lt;&amp;cpu_opp_table&gt;;
		};
	};
</pre>
<p>

These definitions reference <tt>cpu_opp_table</tt>, which is a table
describing the valid operating points for these CPUs; it is also found in
the device tree:
<p>
<pre>
	cpu_opp_table: opp_table {
		compatible = &quot;operating-points-v2&quot;;
		opp-shared;

		opp@1000000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 &lt;1000000000&gt;;
			opp-microvolt = &lt;990000 1000000 1050000&gt;;
			opp-microamp = &lt;70000&gt;;
			clock-latency-ns = &lt;300000&gt;;
			opp-suspend;
		};
		opp@1100000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 &lt;1100000000&gt;;
			opp-microvolt = &lt;1090000 1100000 1150000&gt;;
			opp-microamp = &lt;80000&gt;;
			clock-latency-ns = &lt;310000&gt;;
		};
		opp@1200000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 &lt;1200000000&gt;;
			opp-microvolt = &lt;1190000 1200000 1250000&gt;;
			opp-microamp = &lt;90000&gt;;
			clock-latency-ns = &lt;290000&gt;;
			turbo-mode;
		};
	};
</pre>
<p>
The platform-specific code needed to set up DVFS would look something like:
<p>
<pre>
    const char *name[] = {&quot;vdd&quot;};
    struct opp_table *opp_table;

    opp_table = dev_pm_opp_set_regulators(dev, &amp;name, ARRAY_SIZE(name));
    if (IS_ERR(opp_table))
	dev_err(dev, &quot;Failed to set regulators: %d\n&quot;, PTR_ERR(opp_table));
</pre>
<p>
The driver responsible for voltage and frequency scaling would then do
    something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    ret = dev_pm_opp_set_rate(dev, target_freq);
    if (ret)
	dev_err(dev, &quot;Failed to set rate: %d\n&quot;, ret);
</pre>
<p>

<p>With these enhancements in the OPP core, using the standard interfaces
like clocks and regulators, the device drivers are simplified to a great
extent. Going forward we should enhance the OPP core further to keep all
future DVFS-related configurations in a single place.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

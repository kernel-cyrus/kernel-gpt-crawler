           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 16, 2021</br>
           </div>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems have an architecture that attaches
memory to "nodes" within the system.  CPUs, too, belong to nodes; memory
that is attached to the same node as a CPU will be faster to access (from
that CPU) than memory on other nodes.  This aspect of performance has
important implications for programs running on NUMA systems, and the kernel
offers a number of ways for user space to optimize their behavior.  The NUMA
abstraction is now being extended, though, and that is driving a need for
new ways of influencing memory allocation; the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1626077374-81682-1-git-send-email-feng.tang@intel.com/">multi-preference
memory policy</a> patch set is an attempt to meet that need.
<p>
<h4>Memory policies</h4>
<p>
There is no one-size-fits-all allocation policy that yields the best
performance for all workloads.  If an application can run entirely within a
single NUMA node, the best policy is often to allocate all memory on the
same node so that all accesses are local (and therefore fast).  Larger
applications may want to restrict allocations to a subset of the available
nodes.  For others, though, the best policy may be to distribute
allocations across the system so that performance is roughly uniform across
all CPUs and overall bandwidth is maximized.  As a general rule, the kernel
cannot determine what the best policy for any given process might be.
<p>
Thus, it's up to user space to help the kernel with memory-allocation
policies; there are two system calls for that purpose.  <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><tt>set_mempolicy()</tt></a>
sets the default memory policy for the calling thread, while <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><tt>mbind()</tt></a>
sets policies for specific portions of the calling process's address
space.  There are a number of options that can be used with either system
call.  For example, <tt>MPOL_PREFERRED</tt> asks the kernel to allocate
memory on a single "preferred" node if possible.  A process can, instead,
use <tt>MPOL_BIND</tt> to provide a set of nodes that must be used for all
memory allocations.  <tt>MPOL_INTERLEAVE</tt> asks the kernel to spread
allocations, page by page, across the specified set of nodes.  And so on. 
<p>
These options are generally sufficient for the needs of performance-tuned
applications â€” or, at least, they used to be.  But there is a bit of a
shift in memory technology underway.  The kernel's NUMA support was
designed in a world where all memory attached to any given system is the
same, and the only difference is the node the memory is attached to.
In that world, the only parameter of interest is how local to the CPU any
given range of memory is.
<p>
<h4>The plot thickens</h4>
<p>
Increasingly, though, systems are being built with multiple types of memory.
The most common example at the moment is systems with
persistent memory installed; while that memory can be used for long-term
storage, it can also be used as a slower form of normal RAM.  Persistent
memory has the advantage of being relatively cheap; the ability to install
lots of it may more than make up for its lower performance for many
workloads.  Meanwhile, vendors are also working on high-performance memory
that is faster than ordinary DRAM, but which is too expensive to use
exclusively.
<p>
This presents the kernel (and user space) with a decision that it didn't
have to make before: which <i>type</i> of memory should be used to satisfy
an allocation request?  The solution that has been adopted so far is to
organize exotic memory arrays into special, CPU-less NUMA nodes.  An
application that knows it wants a big chunk of slow memory can set its
memory policy to allocate from the appropriate node, and slow memory is
what it will get.
<p>
There is one little problem with using the existing NUMA infrastructure
this way, though: it doesn't quite fit the problem space.  An application
that is willing to use slower memory is like an economy-class airline
passenger; it is unlikely to be upset if it is given an upgrade at allocation
(boarding) time.  That application may suggest allocating from a
slow-memory node, but allocations should fall back to normal memory if the
slow variety is unavailable.
<p>
The semantics of <tt>MPOL_BIND</tt> do not allow for this behavior; it is a
more strict regime.  If the policy is <tt>MPOL_BIND</tt> and no memory is
available on the specified nodes, unfortunate things can happen; these
include the unleashing of the out-of-memory killer or the delivery of
unexpected <tt>SIGSEGV</tt> signals to the allocating process.  The
willingness to use slower memory does not generally extend to a willingness
to see things collapse in flames if that memory doesn't happen to be
available, so it is hard to blame users if they see <tt>MPOL_BIND</tt> as
being a little too binding.
<p>
On the other hand, <tt>MPOL_PREFERRED</tt> would appear to be the needed
option; it expresses a preference that can be bypassed if the preferred
node has no available memory.  The problem is that, for reasons known only
to the designer of that interface, <tt>MPOL_PREFERRED</tt> only allows the
specification of a single preferred node.  If the desired memory is
distributed across multiple nodes, which is not unlikely, this interface
will not allow an application to make use of all of it.
<p>
<a name="many"></a>
<h4>Multi-preference policies</h4>
<p>
The multi-preference memory policy patch set, which contains work by Feng
Tang, Dave Hansen, and Ben Widawsky, seeks to address this problem by
adding another option called <tt>MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY</tt>; it behaves like
<tt>MPOL_PREFERRED</tt> except that it allows multiple nodes to be
specified.  Programs using this option can request allocation from a set of
nodes offering the desired type of memory, but the kernel can allocate from
elsewhere if the desired nodes lack available resources.  The patch itself
is relatively simple, though it does take a little work to wire up the new
option in all of the desired places.

<p>
This work solves the immediate problem, but it does sidestep a relevant
question: is the NUMA abstraction the right tool for choosing between
different types of memory?  Arguments in favor include the facts that it
works now, doesn't require a whole new memory-type API, and often matches
the actual architecture of the underlying hardware.  On the other hand, it
does conflate two independent concerns (memory type and locality) and
forces user space to work it all out.  It feels a little awkward.
<p>
This <a href="/Articles/752977/">is not the first time</a> that this kind
of question has been raised, but the appetite for new APIs remains low.
Experience suggests that, as long as the NUMA API can be made to work for
memory-type selection, there will not be a lot of pressure to supplement it
with something else; the potential benefits probably do not justify the
considerable extra cost.  So <tt>MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY</tt> is probably the way
things will go.  The patch set appears to be about ready; this option may
appear in a mainline kernel as soon as&nbsp;5.15.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

And slower persistent Memory in DRAM slots or faster on-package (or close to it) is just the beginning. With CXL one can also attach memory further away with good bandwidth but worse latency. <br>
<p>
It may also make sense to look at this a bit like swap or for caching,  a program may prefer closer memory but would also use a more distant node in a sort of LRU manner. <br>

Anybody who has tried to figure out why a Linux system is running short of
memory can attest that the memory usage information made available by the
kernel is, at best, difficult to use.  Matt Mackall has recently been
working on <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/511881">a
set of patches</a> aimed at improving this situation.  Given the
constraints imposed by embedded Linux systems, it is not surprising that
Matt chose the Embedded Linux Conference to present his work (which, incidentally, was funded by the <a href="http://www.celinuxforum.org/">Consumer Electronics Linux Forum</a>).
<p>

<a href="/Articles/230982/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/elc2007/MattMackall-sm.jpg" width=180 height=135
alt="[Matt Mackall]" border=0 align="right"></a>

Matt pointed out that the currently-available information is confusing at
best.  The page cache muddies the situation, and the sharing of pages
between applications complicates things even more.  The result is that it
is hard to say where memory is being used; one can't even get a definitive
answer to the question of how big a specific application is.  More detailed
questions - such as which parts of an application are using the most memory
- are even harder to answer.  Trying to answer questions of interest to
embedded systems developers - how many applications can run on a specific
device without pushing it into thrashing, for example - is nearly
impossible without simply running a test.
<p>

The problem is that the numbers exported by the current kernels are nearly
meaningless.  The reported virtual size of an application is nearly
irrelevant; it says nothing about how much of that virtual space is
actually being used.  The resident set size (RSS) number is a little
better, but there is no information on sharing of pages there.  The
<tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/smaps</tt> file gives a bit of detail, but also lacks
sharing information.  And the presence of memory pressure can change the
situation significantly.
<p>

The Linux virtual memory system, in other words, is a black box which
provides too little information on what is going on inside.  Matt's project
is to open up that box and shine some light inside.
<p>

The first step is to add a new file (<tt>pagemap</tt>) in each process's
<tt>/proc</tt> directory.  It is a binary file containing the page frame
number for each page in the process's address space.  The file can be read
to see where a process's pages have been placed and, more interestingly, it
can be compared between processes to see which pages are being shared.
Matt has a little graphical tool which can display this file, showing the
patterns of which pages are present in memory and which are not.
<p>

Then, there is a file (<tt>/proc/kpagemap</tt>) which provides information
about the kernel's memory map.  For each physical page in the system,
<tt>kpagemap</tt> contains the mapping count and the page flags.  This
information can be used to learn about sharing of pages and about how each
page is being used.  There were a couple of graphical applications using
this file as well; one showed the degree to which each page is being
shared, while the other showed the use of each page as determined by its
flags.
<p>

Once this information is available, one can start to generate some useful
numbers on memory use.  Matt is proposing two new metrics.  The
"proportional set size" (PSS) of a process is the count of pages it has in
memory, where each page is divided by the number of processes sharing it.
So if a process has 1000 pages all to itself, and 1000 shared with one
other process, its PSS will be 1500.  The unique set size (USS), instead,
is a simple count of unshared pages.  It is, for all practical purposes,
the number of pages which will be returned to the system if the process is
killed.
<p>

These numbers are relatively expensive to calculate, since they required a
pass through the process's address space.  So they will not be something
which is regularly exported from the kernel.  They can be calculated in
user space using the pagemap files, though.  Matt demonstrated a couple of
tools to do these calculations.  Using "<tt>memstats</tt>" on a galeon
process, he supplemented the currently-available virtual size and resident
set size numbers (105MB and 41MB, respectively) with a PSS of 26MB and a
USS of 20MB.  There is also a "<tt>memrank</tt>" tool which lists processes
in the system sorted by decreasing PSS.  With a tool like that, finding the
memory hogs on the system becomes a trivial task.
<p>

Matt pointed out that these numbers, while useful, will change depending on
the amount of memory pressure being experienced by the system.  It would be
nice to be able to figure out how much memory a given process truly needs
before it will begin to thrash.  To this end, his patch creates a new
<tt>clear_refs</tt> file for each process; this file can be used to reset
the "referenced" flag on each page in the process's working set.  After the
process runs for a bit, one can look at which pages have had their
referenced bits set again; those are the pages it actually needed to run
during that time.
<p>

The patches are in the -mm tree currently; it's possible that they could
find their way into the mainline once the 2.6.22 merge window opens up.
Those who would like to play with Matt's scripts can find them in <a
href="http://selenic.com/repo/pagemap/">this directory</a>; the slides from
his talk are packaged there as well.  With luck,
understanding system memory usage will require far less guesswork in the
near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Having written an internal guide to "Understanding Memory Utilization" for<br>
my current employer, developed courseware and taught numerous courses in advanced Linux systems administation (including sections on vmstat, top, slaptop etc) and having found, during my career as a consultant, many occasions to explain to programmers: "No, these systems don't need more memory and they are NOT swapping no matter what that top and free seem to be saying" ... with all that under my belt I can say:<br>
<p>
Wow!<br>
<p>
I'm so looking forward to having this incorporate into the mainstream. I<br>
can scarcely imagine how much easier it will be to administer systems and<br>
monitor memory capacity issues with these.<br>
<p>
(Of course we'll still strive for a simple rule of thumb ... if you don't<br>
have about half of your RAM available for caching ... you could probably<br>
use a bit more in the system). :)<br>
<p>
(I'm also looking forward to seeing the merge of I/O stats and atop compatible kernel patches that allow us to find the I/O hogs on a per process and per channel basis; that's been a, by far, the worst gap in<br>
the performance analysis arsenal for Linux).<br>

      I've always been somewhat confused that the default kernel couldn't provide the data atop needs to display IO stats, as that's one of the most useful things I've ever seen for tuning a Linux system.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry to be somewhat redundant here, but I'd like to say a big "me too" on atop and memstats.<br>

Clearly this will all be a good thing and even though the memory stats aren't perfect, you CAN
look at memory and any other stats you want with the tool I build called collectl, which you
can get at <a href="http://collectl.sourceforge.net/">http://collectl.sourceforge.net/</a>

Collectl allows to to gather just about any of the major system performance metrics and
display then side-by-side or in more deal on multiple lines.  There's even a format that
allows you to put it in a format understandable by gnuplot.  Here's a simple example of just
looking at memory and disk

#&lt;-----------Memory----------&gt;&lt;-----------Disks-----------&gt;
#free buff cach inac slab  map KBRead  Reads  KBWrit Writes
  55M 552M   2G 532M    0    0      0      0       0      0
  55M 552M   2G 532M    0    0      0      0     220      6
  55M 552M   2G 532M    0    0      0      0       0      0

but there are far too many combinations to even try.  Check it out and see what you think.

btw - I chose to leave off time in the output above to save screen real estate but you can
easily add it in with a simple switch and if you want even more details, can include msec!
Why is this important?  Because collectl can run at sub-second intervals and if you care about
network stats and don't monitor at an interval of 0.9765 you'll lose accuracy.  If you don't
think that's true, I have a page on the website that goes into the details.

      There's also a tool called exmap &lt;<a href="http://www.berthels.co.uk/exmap/">http://www.berthels.co.uk/exmap/</a>&gt;, which does something similar, although perhaps not as comprehensively. There's also a console version for embedded applications, called exmap-console &lt;<a href="http://projects.o-hand.com/exmap-console">http://projects.o-hand.com/exmap-console</a>&gt; -- there was an interesting presentation at FOSDEM on it.<br>
<p>
I like the Proportional Set Size and Unique Set Size measurements mentioned in the article -- hopefully they will be exposed in top.<br>

I've just written coremem.go, inspired by @pixelb's ps_mem; Any comments or improvements idea are welcome here and github:<br>
<p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/crquan/coremem">https://github.com/crquan/coremem</a><br>
<p>
Improvements over pixelb's python script:<br>
<p>
1) written with Go language's concurrent model that makes it run much faster, on a server with 1400 processes running this takes 2s to print results, vs. the ps_mem.py takes 36s; Go compiler's default output is a static binary, makes it useful with hosts where there is no python.<br>
<p>
2) ignoring access permission error if run with normal user id, this is useful for desktop users, they can get core mem information for their own processes, while administrator can still run with sudo for the whole system.<br>

      It is somewhat funny how nowadays many people working with Linux seem to <br>
reinvent the same wheels, albeit of different color and size :-).<br>
<p>
Some time ago I wrote a tool that does reporting based on URES (unique <br>
residest size, RRES - SHARED in this case, which is the same as USS). For <br>
this to work, no kernel patching is required. And of course the number by <br>
itself has the same limitations as the USS.<br>
<p>
The tool (written in Python) can be found here: <br>
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://koltsoff.com/pub/meminfo">http://koltsoff.com/pub/meminfo</a> . And another page explaining URES is <br>
mentioned there as well.<br>
<p>
The idea of URES/USS has been implemented (at least in the VCS-version) <br>
of KDE ksysguard and based on short email communication will not be <br>
implemented in gnome-system-monitor.<br>
<p>
When dealing with systems that are running X server(s), it also is useful <br>
to know that GUI programs often use bitmaps (and other resources) that <br>
are actually accounted in X server at some point, and this will lead to <br>
somewhat skewed memory usage results. This will also apply to any <br>
client-server system in which part of client resources are allocated (and <br>
present in memory of) the server.<br>

to know that GUI programs often use bitmaps (and other resources) that<br>

<p>
xrestop can give some stats about those resources. However, I used to have the gut feeling that the increase in memory usage of the X server caused by client programs is bigger than the one reported by xrestop.<br>
<p>
For instance, right now ~130M (mostly for pixmaps, with 40M for Firefox with ~60 tabs in 4 windows) are allocated by client programs on my system, out of 300M  of X's RSS, and 390M of anonymous data memory (i.e. mostly heap).<br>
<p>
Time ago, I read on some blog about optimizations for OLPC that the funny thing is that those cached bitmaps are _uncompressed_ (yes, even for JPEGs), and that Firefox caches all bitmaps from all pages. That's a real pity, since decompressing them on the fly would be surely faster than swapping, and maybe even faster than loading them from memory (not sure on this, unless the graphic card supports loading JPEGs in memory).<br>

I just wanted to follow up on a comment I posted a couple of years ago <br>
about <br>
a monitoring too I wrote awhile back called collectl that can monitor just <br>
about anything any of the common linux tools do while providing a <br>
consistent <br>
user interface.  In fact, on the topic of memory, it also can show slab <br>
usage  <br>
and buddy info.  <br>
<p>
And if you really like ganglia you can pass anything to it collectl can <br>
collect, not via some whimpy shell interfaces that always have too much <br>
overhead, but via sockets for almost not overhead.  That's why the folks at <br>
PNNL use collectl on their 2300 node cluster as their ganglia monitoring <br>
agents.<br>
<p>
But that's not why I'm posting this but rather to let people know I've <br>
recently released a set of utilities that add graphics to collectl.  You <br>
can <br>
either generate plots from previously gathered data OR do it in real-time.  <br>

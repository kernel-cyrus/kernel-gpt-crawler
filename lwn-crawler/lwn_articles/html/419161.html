<h1>Pathname-based hooks for SELinux?</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>December 8, 2010</br>
           </div>
<p>
A <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/418849/">patch</a> that would add the
last path 
component as a parameter to the Linux security module (LSM) hooks for inode
creation 
raised a few eyebrows. It looked to be an attempt to add
pathname-based hooks for SELinux&mdash;after many SELinux developers took
strong stands against those kinds of hooks when they were proposed for
AppArmor and, 
later, TOMOYO.  But, this change would not add pathname-based access
controls to SELinux, and would, instead, allow it to make decisions about
the label it applies to a new inode based on the filename being created.
Still, there are questions about whether this is just an <i>ad hoc</i>
change to the LSM API for SELinux, and whether there are other hooks that
might benefit 
from similar treatment.
</p>

<p>
The patches, which were proposed by Eric Paris on the linux-security-module
mailing list, are fairly straightforward.
The first simply adds a 
<tt>struct qstr</tt> pointer to the <tt>inode_init_security()</tt> hook and
changes all the calls to it that are made, mostly in various filesystems.  A
<tt>qstr</tt> is a "quick string" object from the directory entry cache,
which contains the filename and some additional information (length and
hash).  The other <a href="/Articles/419215/">patch</a> in the set changes
SELinux so that it can use that information in its policies:
<div class="BigQuote">
Currently SELinux has rules which label new objects according to 3 criteria.
The label of the process creating the object, the label of the parent
directory, and the type of object (reg, dir, char, block, etc.)  This patch
adds a 4th criteria, the dentry name, thus we can distinguish between
creating a file in an etc_t directory called shadow and one called motd.
<p>
There is no file globbing, regex parsing, or anything mystical.  Either the
policy exactly (strcmp) matches the dentry name of the object or it doesn't.
This patch has no changes from today if policy does not implement the new
rules.

<p>
But the inclusion of path information was enough to get a <a
href="/Articles/419216/">rise</a> out of Casey Schaufler: "<q>I
see. Pathname based controls. In SELinux.</q>".  He went on to note that
AppArmor and TOMOYO had made similar arguments to Paris's and that there
are already pathname-based hooks that were added to support those two
solutions.  But Paris is quick to <a href="/Articles/419217/">point out</a>
that he is <i>not</i> implementing pathname-based access controls (which is
what AppArmor and TOMOYO implement), but is only adding additional
information for decisions about labeling new filesystem objects:
<div class="BigQuote">
 The intention is to remove some particularly gross userspace hacks
related to new object labeling (read udev/restorecond/anything to do
with /var/run, etc).  It simplifies userspace, removes numerous races,
and does so with no reduction in security (and theoretically the
possibility of a more secure system)
</div>
</p>

<p>
Schaufler <a href="/Articles/419218/">does not completely buy that
argument</a> because of the way labels 
are typically maintained in an SELinux system, i.e. using user-space
utilities like <tt>restorecond</tt> that <i>are</i> pathname-based: "<q>Yes, the kernel component of SELinux relies strictly on the labels,
but the reality is that SELinux is heavily dependent on the user space
component to maintain the proper labels on files so that the specified
policy is rational.</q>"  Stephen Smalley agreed with that to some
extent, but <a
href="/Articles/419219/">tries to clarify</a> the role of pathnames in
SELinux:
<div class="BigQuote">
 That fact that we are already
using the parent directory context as an input in computing the
security context of a new files means that our file labeling logic is
already "path-based" in a certain sense.  It isn't solely path-based
(either before or after this change), but it is already taking into
account the placement of the file when it is created.  This just
refines the granularity at which we can make such decisions.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Smalley also explains more about the kinds of race conditions that the
patch is trying to avoid: 

<div class="BigQuote">
restorecond and udev relabeling of
kernel-created dev nodes are inherently racy - the file is not created
in the desired security context initially, and must be relabeled by
some userspace component that notices that the file has been created.
Kernel support for incorporating the last component name as an
additional input enables us to label certain files correctly upon
creation and thus avoids that problem entirely.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Smalley said, the pathname-based hooks that are currently
available in the LSM API are not usable to solve this problem because they
don't address the issue of assigning labels to new inodes. The existing hooks
are "<q>about enforcing access control upon file accesses based on the
pathname used to reach the file</q>".  The SELinux community has reached
a consensus that the proposed change is needed, Smalley said, and the only
real question in his mind was whether the changes were acceptable to the
Linux virtual filesystem (VFS) and various filesystem developers. 
</p>

<p>
While Schaufler <a href="/Articles/419220/">recognizes</a> that the SELinux
community is fully behind the change, he wonders if there are other hooks
that could also benefit from the filename information:
<div class="BigQuote">
One of the concerns that has traditionally been raised when new
LSM hooks or changes to existing hooks are proposed is that of
generality. I can think of a number of ways in which the final
component of a pathname could be used to make access control
decisions, but I would not expect to be using them myself. Who
else might you expect to make use of this LSM "enhancement", or
is this something that only SELinux is ever going to want? Is
the component something the LSM should be providing in general,
or is this the only case in which it makes sense?
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to point out that the LSM API is inconsistent and arbitrary, so
it would make sense to look at the "bigger picture" before hacking in a
change specifically for SELinux.  As an example, he posits a possible access control
mechanism that uses file extensions to make decisions ("<q>only files suffixed with '.exe' can be executed and
  only files suffixed with '.so' can be mmapped</q>").  Smalley <a
  href="/Articles/419221/">believes</a> that kind of access control could
  be done with the existing pathname-based hooks, but Kyle Moffett <a href="/Articles/419223/">came up</a>
  with another place where the filename information might be useful, even
  for SELinux: 
<div class="BigQuote">
 While
you of course cannot (and should not) *change* the label of a file in
a link() or rename() operation, it would potentially be useful to deny
an operation based on the old label and the new name that is being
passed in.
</div>
<p>
The example Moffett gives would deny a compromised web application the
ability to rename 
or link to the <tt>.htaccess</tt> file in its directories.
</p>

<p>
So far, none of the VFS or filesystem hackers have spoken up one way or
another, so it is unclear whether this change will be acceptable to them.
The LSM API is something of a kernel outcast&mdash;or so it appears at
times&mdash;as no one is particularly satisfied with it, yet it is an
integral part of 
the kernel security landscape.  Sometimes that means that various "hacks"
get added for specific security solutions, without looking at the overall
picture, which is rather unfortunate.  It may well be that this change is
adopted, as is, without considering other potential users or consistency in
the API.

Somehow escaping the inode/pathname discussion, I've been using the hybrid approach in grsecurity's RBAC system since it was created and even before it had role support.  I knew since the beginning it was an important common-case situation for both usability and policy enforcement.  Good to hear people are catching up with what I was doing in 2001.<br>

From a user/admin standpoint it never made much sense to me that the same data in a file system could have multiple different permissions associated with it. It's just asking for trouble if I could have a filename that was only root readable on one hand, but have the same data world writable on the other hand just based on how they are referenced in the directory tree.<br>

This does seem like the right way to go.<br>

"SELinux very much so is and will continue to be based solely on label based controls."<br>
<p>
And I thought SELinux developers had finally decided to fix the mess and make it usable by normal people... :/<br>
<p>
(IMO SELinux would be a good example for the design pattern articles: theorically beautiful, but in practice a good part of their userspace exists to workaround problems caused by it - including a semiautomatic system to submit selinux problems to the bugzilla and get the a fedora update for the policy package!)<br>

<p>But this isn't pathname-based access controls at all.
<p>It's delegation of labeling responsibility. If you have labeling authority, either you do all the labeling yourself or you delegate the responsibility, to a human or to a computer, and to do that you must give instructions. 
<p>The security labels are applied directly to the object; its name is immediately completely irrelevant, and that's just as it should be.

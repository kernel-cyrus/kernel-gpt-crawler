<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 1, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200528201402.1708239-1-sashal@kernel.org/">FSGSBASE
patch series</a> is up to its thirteenth version as of late May.  It
enables some "new" 
instructions for the x86 architecture, opening the way for a number of
significant performance improvements.  One might think that such a patch
series would be a shoo-in, but FSGSBASE has had a troubled history;
meanwhile, the delays in getting it merged may have led to a number of
users installing root holes on their Linux systems in the hope of improving
security.
<p>
"Segments" are a holdover from ancient versions of the x86 architecture;
they once were distinct regions of memory used to get around the addressing
limitations of that era.  Virtual memory has done away with the need for
segments, but the concept persists; x86_64 processors only implement two of
the original segments (called "FS" and "GS").  In these processors, a
"segment" is really just an offset into virtual memory with little other
meaning; their remaining value comes from the segment-based addressing
mode supported by the CPU.
<p>
Historic or not, these segment registers are still used.  A common use for
FS in 
user space is thread-local storage; each thread has a unique value of the
FS base register pointing to its own storage area.  Code running in threads
can then use segment-based addressing to access local storage without
having to worry about where that storage is.  The kernel, instead, uses GS
in a similar way
for per-CPU data.  There are some relics of the kernel's one-time use of FS
to indicate the address range accessible to user space, but the kernel's <a
href="/Articles/722267/"><tt>get_fs()</tt> and <tt>set_fs()</tt>
functions</a> no longer use that segment.
<p>
Modifying the segment registers has always been a privileged operation.
There is value, though, in letting user space make use of the FS and GS
base registers, so the kernel provides that functionality via the <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/arch_prctl.2.html"><tt>arch_prctl()</tt>
system call</a>.  Since the base registers are actually set by the kernel,
privileged code can count on knowing what their contents will be (and that
said contents make sense).
<p>
<h4>FSGSBASE</h4>
<p>
Calling into the kernel to set a register is a relatively expensive
operation, though.  If the call needs to be done once to set up a
thread-local storage area, nobody will notice the cost, but code needing to
make frequent changes to the FS or GS base register will be slowed down by
the system-call overhead.  Actually setting those registers, which are
stored in x86 model-specific registers (MSRs), is somewhat costly in its own
right.  So Intel added a set of instructions to directly manipulate the FS
and GS base registers to the "Ivy Bridge" series of processors in 2012.
This set of instructions is often referred to as "FSGSBASE".
<p>
Before user space can actually use those instructions, though, the kernel
must set a special bit enabling them and, despite the time that has passed
since they became available, that bit remains unset.  Since the kernel has
always had control of those registers, it contains a number of assumptions
about their contents; just letting user space change them without preparing
the kernel first is a recipe for any of a number of easily exploited
vulnerabilities.
<p>
Avoiding those problems is conceptually fairly simple, though a bit more
complex in the implementation.  The kernel must take pains to ensure that
the FS and (especially) GS registers have correct values on every entry
into kernel space.  The handling of <a href="/Articles/795637/">certain
speculative-execution vulnerabilities</a> gets a bit more complicated.
And, of course, a control knob must be provided so that administrators can
turn FSGSBASE off if need be.
<p>
All it takes is somebody to write this code.
Intel was slow to post FSGSBASE patches â€” and nobody else stepped forward to
do that work either.  When patches were finally posted, they ran into a
number of problems in review and have required numerous revisions.  The
curious can see <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.21.1903261010380.1789@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">this
message from Thomas Gleixner</a> for an opinionated timeline of events
through March 2019.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1557309753-24073-1-git-send-email-chang.seok.bae@intel.com/">Version&nbsp;7
of the patch set</a>, posted in May 2019, got as far as being merged into
the x86 subsystem tree before various problems came to light; that merge
was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?h=x86/cpu&id=049331f277fef1c3f2527c2c9afa1d285e9a1247">subsequently
reverted</a> in a rather grumpy way after new problems came to light.  More
recently, Sasha Levin has picked
up this work (despite not being an Intel employee) and is trying to get it
across the line; he may yet succeed for the 5.9 development cycle.
<p>
<h4>Root holes enter a vacuum</h4>
<p>
The development of this seemingly simple feature has been a rather long and
fraught process; during all of this time, users have been unable to take
advantage of it.  But users, being users, have proved unwilling to wait.
One of the use cases that has created the most pressure is Intel's "<a
href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/software-guard-extensions.html">Software
Guard Extensions</a>" (SGX), which is meant to allow the creation of private
"enclaves" to protect privileged code and data.  SGX support for the kernel
has had <a
href="/Articles/786487/">its own difficult history</a> and remains unmerged,
so developers wanting to figure out how to make use
of this feature have been working entirely out of tree.
<p>
One of the most prominent projects in this area is <a
href="https://grapheneproject.io/">Graphene</a>, which describes itself as
a "library OS" for secure applications.  The web site mentions SGX this
way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Graphene runs unmodified applications inside Intel SGX. It supports
	dynamically loaded libraries, runtime linking, multi-process
	abstractions, and file authentication. For additional security,
	Graphene performs cryptographic and semantic checks at untrusted
	host interface. Developers provide a manifest file to configure the
	application environment and isolation policies, Graphene
	automatically does the rest.
</div>
<p>
Graphene got its start as a research project, but has since received a
fair amount of support from companies, including Intel.  The project has
ambitions for being the standard SGX support platform, and some cloud
providers are evidently <a
href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/protecting-go-language-applications-with-the-graphene-library-os-on-intel%C2%AE-sgx%C2%AE-secured-alibaba-cloud_594889">looking
at supporting it</a> â€” with Intel's blessing.
<p>
There is just one little problem with Graphene: working with SGX requires
the ability to modify the FS base register frequently.  To keep calls into
enclaves fast, Graphene loads <a
href="https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene-sgx-driver/blob/master/gsgx.c">a
little kernel module</a> that enables the FSGSBASE instructions.  Since the
kernel is not prepared for this, that action immediately opens up a root
hole on the system involved â€” just what one wants to see from a system that
is supposed to bring heightened security.  Graphene is not alone in this
behavior; the <a href="https://github.com/occlum/occlum">Occlum SGX
library</a> does the same thing, for example.
<p>
It is fair to say that the kernel-development community was, as a whole,
unimpressed by this approach to the problem.  Don Porter, one of the
creators of Graphene, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c5fffcd1-c262-7046-a047-67de2bbccd78@cs.unc.edu/">tried
to justify</a> enabling FSGSBASE behind the kernel's back by pointing out
that SGX projects assume that 
the host operating system is compromised; SGX exists to protect data in
just that situation, after all.  Extending that philosophy to compromising
the system from the outset, though, is still a hard sell.
<p>
In the end, kernel developers can usually understand the idea of using this
kind of 
a hack to get a problem out of the way while addressing other issues.  The
fact that there is no warning to be found in Graphene's flashy web site, or in
the papers describing Graphene, that installing the code compromises the
system is harder to swallow.  There is even, as Levin <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200518151604.GC33628@sasha-vm/">pointed out</a>, a
book called <i>Responsible Genomic Data Sharing</i> that suggests using
Graphene, which seems not entirely responsible.  After some discussion,
Porter <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/39df26f2-9d17-b0f2-6a55-48195542637b@cs.unc.edu/">came
around to the idea</a> that some high-profile warnings are needed to keep
potential users from opening up their systems in the name of "security".
<p>
Warnings are a step in the right direction, but the proper way to address
this problem is to get the 
FSGSBASE patches into the kernel so that the other hacks are no longer
necessary.  As an added benefit, these patches make the kernel faster too,
since the new instructions are faster than performing operations on MSRs.
Proper FSGSBASE support should, thus, make almost everybody happier.
<p>
As noted, that will hopefully happen soon.  This whole long affair has left
a bit of a bad taste in many developers' mouths, though; there is some
overt unhappiness with how Intel has handled the situation.

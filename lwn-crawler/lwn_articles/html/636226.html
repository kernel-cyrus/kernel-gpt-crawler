Andrea Arcangeli's <a href="/Articles/615086/"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
patch set has been in development for a couple of years now; it has the
look of one of those large memory-management changes that takes forever to
find its way into the mainline.  The good news in this case was announced
at the beginning of this session in the memory-management track of the 2015
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit: there is now the
beginning of an agreement with Linus that the patches are in reasonable
shape.  So we may see this code merged relatively soon.
<p>
The <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> patch set, in short, allows for the handling of
page faults in user space.  This seemingly crazy feature was originally
designed for the migration of virtual machines running under KVM.  The
running guest can move to a new host while leaving its memory behind,

<a href="/Articles/636228/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lsfmm/AndreaArcangeli-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Andrea Arcangeli]" title="Andrea Arcangeli" hspace=3 vspace=2
border=0 align="left"></a>

speeding the migration.  When that guest starts faulting in the missing
pages, the user-space mechanism can pull them across the net and store them
in the guest's address space.  The result is quick migration without the
need to put any sort of page-migration protocol into the kernel.
<p>
Andrea was asked whether the kernel, rather than implementing the
file-descriptor-based notification mechanism, could just use
<tt>SIGBUS</tt> signals 
to indicate an access to a missing page.  That will not work in this case,
though.  It would require massively increasing the number of virtual memory
areas (VMAs) maintained in the kernel for the process, could cause system
calls to fail, and doesn't handle the case of in-kernel page faults
resulting from <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> calls.  What's really needed is
for a page fault to simply block the faulting process while a separate
user-space process (the "monitor") is notified to deal with the issue.
<p>
Pavel Emelyanov stood up to talk about his use case for this feature, which
is the live migration of containers using the <a
href="http://criu.org/Main_Page">checkpoint-restore in user space (CRIU)</a>
mechanism.  While the KVM-based use case involves having the monitor
running as a separate thread in the same process, the CRIU case requires
that the monitor be running in a different process entirely.  This can be
managed by sending the file descriptor obtained from <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>
over a socket to the monitor process.
<p>
There are, Pavel said, a few issues that come up when
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> is used in this mode.  The user-space fault handling
doesn't follow a <tt>fork()</tt> (it remains attached to the parent process
only), so faults in the child process will just
be resolved with zero-filled pages.  If the target process moves a VMA in
its virtual address space with <tt>mremap()</tt>, the monitor will see the
new virtual addresses and be confused by them.  And, after a fork, existing
memory goes into the copy-on-write mode, making it impossible to populate
pages in both processes.  The conversation did not really get into possible
solutions for these problems, though.
<p>
Andrea talked a bit about the <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> API, which has evolved
in the past months.  There is now a set of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls for
performing the requisite operations.  The <tt>UFFDIO_REGISTER</tt> call is
used to tell the kernel about a range of virtual addresses for which faults
will be handled in user space.  Currently the system only deals with
page-not-present faults.  There are plans, though, to deal with
write-protect faults as well.  That would enable the tracking of dirtied
pages which, in turn, would allow live snapshotting of processes or the
active migration of pages back to a "memory node" elsewhere on the network.
<p>
With regard to the potential live-snapshotting feature, most of the needed
mechanism is already there.  There is one little problem in that, should
the target modify a page that is currently resident on the swap device, the
resulting swap-in fault will make the page writable.  So
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> will miss the write operation and the page will not
be copied.  Some changes to the swap code will be needed to add a
write-protect bit to swap entries before this feature will work properly.
<p>
Earlier versions of the patch introduced a <tt>remap_anon_pages()</tt>
system call that would be used to slot new pages into the target process's
address space.  In the current version, that operation has been turned into
another <tt>ioctl()</tt> operation.  Actually, there is more than one;
there are now options to either copy a page into the target process or to
remap the page directly.  Zero-copy operation has a certain naive appeal,
but it turns out that the associated translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
flush is more expensive than simply copying the data.  So the remap option
is of limited use and unlikely to make it upstream.
<p>
Andrew Lutomirski worried that this feature was adding "weird semantics" to
memory management.  Might it be better, he said, to set up
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> as a sort of device that could then be mapped into
memory with <tt>mmap()</tt>?  That would isolate the special-case code and
not change how "normal memory" behaves.  The problem is that doing things
this way would cause the affected memory range to lose access to many other
useful memory-management features, including swapping, transparent huge
pages, and more.  It would, Pavel said, put "weird VMAs" into a process
that really just "wants to live its own life" after migration.
<p>
As the discussion headed toward a close, Andrea suggested that
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> could perhaps be used to implement the
long-requested "<a href="/Kernel/Index/#Volatile_ranges">volatile
ranges</a>"  feature.  First, though, there is a need to finalize the API
for this feature and get it merged; it is currently blocking the addition
of the post-copy migration feature to KVM.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder if this could be used in UML? I guess it would be faster instead of relying on signal handling as its done currently for the "user mode processes"?<br>

I had to chuckle at the "seemingly crazy feature" phrase.<br>
<p>
When TOPS-10 first came out with paging (as opposed to swapping), the page fault handler was a bit of code mapped into the user address space and run in user mode.  The kernel ("monitor" in TOP-10-ese) had system calls to do vm-y things, but no monitor mode page fault handler.  I worked in a DEC-10 shop at the time and I remember looking at the new release with a couple other guys, all of us going "Huh???  Why???".<br>

This reminds me of the old password checking flaw in TOPS-20. The "login" (or equivalent) system was passed a user space buffer as parameter, from which it read the password one character at a time. Once it got an incorrect character, it stopped and returned "incorrect password". The trick was to place the password at a page boundary, so that one part of it was at the end of page N and the next part continued at the start of page N+1. If you got a page fault, you knew that the characters on page N were correct. This significantly reduced the amount of work to crack the password by brute force.<br>

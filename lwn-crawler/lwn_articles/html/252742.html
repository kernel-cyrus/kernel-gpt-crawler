<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>October 3, 2007</br>
           </div>
<p> The Linux Driver Project (LDP) just got a big boost, courtesy of Novell
and Greg Kroah-Hartman.  The project was <a
href="http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/free_drivers.html">announced</a> last
January to much acclaim, but has languished since, buried under
Kroah-Hartman's "day job" and Linux kernel development work.  Now, he will
be able to devote much more time to the project as his employer, Novell,
has shifted his job responsibilities to <a
href="http://driverdev.linuxdriverproject.org/pipermail/devel/2007-September/000001.html">work
full-time on the LDP</a>.  </p>

<p> The original project announcement was released in conjunction with the
Freedom HEC conference and was described by Kroah-Hartman as a "lame
publicity stunt", because it just reiterated the standard Linux driver
development model: with some hardware and some information, a driver for
your device will be written.  There was a new wrinkle, though; an arrangement
worked out with the Linux Foundation to allow driver developers to
sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with hardware vendors to get access
to documentation and other information about the device.  NDAs for driver
development are <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/203562/">controversial in
some quarters</a>, but are often required by hardware vendors.  </p>

<p> There are numerous benefits for Linux: the drivers will all be licensed
under
the GPL, will get merged into the mainline tree, and be available for all
Linux users.  Other free operating systems may be able to use the source to
write drivers for their systems, as well.  Kroah-Hartman notes that a
surprising added benefit is for new kernel developers:

<div class="BigQuote">
Another wonderful benefit that I never had imagined in the beginning is
that we are now providing a way for developers who want to write
something "real" to have a place to go.  The biggest response I got from
my first announcement was from developers wanting to help out.  I had
over 80 people sign up to help out as they wanted to be able to
contribute to Linux, but did not previously know how to do so in a
tangible manner.  This project gives them a place where they can develop
and maintain a real driver for the kernel community.
</div>
</p>

<p> Now that he has time to devote to LDP, Kroah-Hartman has put together
two <a
href="http://driverdev.linuxdriverproject.org/mailman/listinfo">mailing
lists</a> along with a <a
href="http://linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view">wiki</a> to track the
project.  There is a mailing list for each of the two main roles,
developers and project managers.  The role of a project manager will be to
facilitate the development, making sure that the driver hacker has what
they need to get the job done and keeping the company, for whom the driver
is being written, informed of the status.  In short, they will shepherd an
individual driver in much the same way that Kroah-Hartman is coordinating
the LDP as a whole.  </p>

<p>
In less than a week since the project restart, there are five <a
href="http://driverdev.linuxdriverproject.org/pipermail/devel/2007-October/000046.html">driver
projects up for grabs</a>, including a "clean-up and get merged" project
that would be suitable as a first driver for someone just starting out in
Linux driver development.  Project managers are lining up to take on the
drivers as well.  The numbers of volunteers have grown, but as
Kroah-Hartman notes, publicity is something the project still needs:
<div class="BigQuote">
We currently have over 200 people signed up to be a developer, so we
doing quite well there.  We also have over 25 people signed up to be a
project manager, so I think we are good there too.  What we do need the
most help on right now is to find more companies that need our help.
Spreading the word that this service is available and open to any company
is the biggest importance I think at this time.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Already, there are drivers for many different kinds of devices
in the pipeline:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] audio codec devices, USB timestamp devices, VOIP devices,
video camera devices, lots of different types of data acquisition
devices, as well as some custom bus interconnects and even some whole
system-on-a-chip devices.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Kroah-Hartman plans to reconnect with various companies that contacted him
since January, but fell by the wayside.  As that happens and the word gets
out about the project, there should be driver development projects suitable
for a wide range of interests and various levels of kernel experience.  By
providing a self-contained project that is targeted at inclusion in the
mainline, more developers will be exposed to that process, which should
expand the ranks of kernel hackers.
</p>

<p>
Linux already supports more hardware than any operating system has before
and the LDP will only extend that lead.  There are huge benefits for Linux,
the developers and project managers, the companies whose devices will be
supported, as well as for distributors like Novell.  There may be
complaints about signing NDAs, but the drivers will be free, not
obfuscated; once companies see how easy it is to get a high-quality driver
into the kernel, they will certainly come back for more.  This can only be
a good thing for all free software systems, not just Linux.

      This LDP abbreviation is also used for the Linux Documentation Project
(<a href="http://tldp.org/">http://tldp.org/</a>). As both projects are closely related to Linux, this will certainly cause confusion...

      So how does an NDA sit with writing proper comments in device driver code, or even choosing nice descriptive variable and constant names ? A mark of good code is that someone can understand *why* it is doing things the way that it does - it seems to me that the purpose of an NDA is the exact opposite.<br>

      The documentation necessary to build a device driver may be mixed with other things, not relevant to how the device works. For example, you might have electronics schematics, competition comparisons, or even future plans for the device. And the company might not want to devote the time needed to separate it. An NDA might specify that the developer may not divulge any information not relevant to the device driver.

      That future plans clause is the one I've seen mentioned before in this <br>
regard.  In several hardware product areas (particularly embedded, think <br>
cell phones and some of the individual components they contain), the <br>
public lifetime of a product isn't much more than six months.  This is <br>
far too short a time to get a full driver written, start to finish, and <br>
by the time it's out and stable, the product itself has long disappeared <br>
and been replaced by new generations, perhaps not entirely different, but <br>
enough different so adapting the drivers to match, then testing them, <br>
takes yet another hardware generation, and the driver never /can/ catch <br>
up with the software, even given reasonably decent support during 100% of <br>
the public life of the product.  That's especially the case considering <br>
the kernel release cycle itself is 2-3 months, so even if development <br>
started immediately and went without a hitch, it could be half the <br>
product's publicly available life cycle before drivers are available in a <br>
released kernel!<br>
<p>
Enter these NDAs and developers willing to sign them; willing to work <br>
with the company from long before the product is made public; from even <br>
before product plans are finalized.  This can be VERY competition <br>
sensitive information, and the company is right to worry about it getting <br>
into the wrong hands.  A limited time NDA, expiring on most of the <br>
technical data when the product goes public, but permanently covering <br>
business plans and the like, even including stuff such as products that <br>
never made the cut, for whatever reason, as that sort of info on the <br>
process could be very damaging should it get into the competitor's hands, <br>
can very well mean the difference in these cases between a working driver <br>
available and in the released kernel at product release (meaning <br>
development time of at least 90 days before that, time covered under NDA, <br>
even if the drivers themselves are public), and one not available at all <br>
during the actively available product lifetime.<br>
<p>

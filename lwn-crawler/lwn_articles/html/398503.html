<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 3, 2010</br>
           </div>
Linux, like most other operating systems, has long tried to keep
frequently-accessed data in main memory.  The cost of fetching a page from
disk is high, so every I/O operation which can be eliminated by keeping
data in a faster location yields a significant performance improvement.
Recently, there has been an increasing level of interest in adding more
levels of cache; the result has been patches like 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/394672/">bcache</a>,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/386090/">Cleancache/Frontswap</a>, 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/397574/">zcache</a>, and more.  The latest
contribution in this area is a set of patches aimed at enabling multi-level
caching within the Btrfs filesystem.
<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/397643/">patches</a>, posted by Ben
Chociej, are not a complete solution at this time.  This code, instead, is
meant to add the infrastructure needed to determine which data within a
filesystem is "hot"; other work, to be done in the near future, will then
be able to make use of this information to determine which data would
benefit from 
being hosted on faster media - on a solid-state storage device, perhaps.
The copy-on-write nature of Btrfs, along with its built-in volume
management code, should make the implementation of this functionality
relatively easy.  We should find out in "a few weeks," when the first of
these patches is promised; meanwhile, there is some interesting
instrumentation work to look at.
<p>
These patches work by hooking into the small number of places in Btrfs
where new I/O operations are initiated.  Each of these places gets a call
to: 
<p>
<pre>
    void btrfs_update_freqs(struct inode *inode, u64 start, u64 len, 
			    int create);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>inode</tt> is the inode for the file being operated on,
<tt>start</tt> is the beginning offset (in bytes), <tt>len</tt> is the
number of bytes being transferred, and the mildly confusing <tt>create</tt>
parameter is nonzero iff the operation is a write.
This function maintains two red-black trees; the first, which is
filesystem-wide, tracks the "hottest" inodes.  For each inode, there is 
another tree tracking the hottest parts of the file.  For each tree, the
<tt>btrfs_update_freqs()</tt> call will update the stored parameters with
the passed-in values.
<p>
The code tracks six independent parameters: the number of reads, a running
average of the time between reads, and the time since the last read - along
with the same information for writes.  In the end, that information gets
passed to a piece of deep magic called <tt>btrfs_get_temp()</tt> which
boils those numbers down to a single "temperature" value.  Your editor
would love to simply provide the formula which is used, but it's not that
simple - there's a lot of trickery with magic constants and various
provisions against integer overflow problems.  For those who would like to
figure it out for themselves, here's <a href="/Articles/398511/">the source for
<tt>btrfs_get_temp()</tt></a>. 
<p>
There are three new <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations added by the patch set.  To
get the heat information for a specific file,
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_GET_HEAT_INFO</tt> may be used.  There are also
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_GET_HEAT_OPTS</tt> and <tt>BTRFS_IOC_SET_HEAT_OPTS</tt> for
querying and setting the state of heat tracking and (someday) migration of
data based on the measured temperature data.  A debugfs interface is also
provided for those who would like to look at all of the data collected by
this instrumentation.
<p>

There has not been a huge response to this patch set so far.  The biggest
complaint should be somewhat predictable: this capability looks like
something which would be useful for many filesystems, so implementing it
just for Btrfs looks like working at the wrong level.  The virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer is well placed to track I/O operations and could
manage this kind of data collection.  The VFS could also, perhaps, use this
data to make better decisions on which pages to keep in the page cache.
But, as long as the data is locked up within Btrfs, the VFS layer cannot
use it, and it cannot be used to benefit any other filesystems.
<p>
The response to this complaint is that only Btrfs has the multiple device
support needed to make use of this data.  Dave Chinner <a
href="/Articles/398512/">finds that justification unconvincing</a>, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Why does it even need multiple devices in the filesystem? All the
	filesystem needs to know is the relative speed of regions of it's
	block address space and to be provided allocation hints.
</div>
<p>
There is often a degree of tension between those who would add features to
specific filesystems and those who would rather see that functionality done
at the VFS level.  As a general rule, widely-useful features benefit from
being done in the VFS, where they are more widely used and more closely
scrutinized.  But, often, an individual filesystem implementation can serve
as a useful proof of concept and a place where important lessons are
learned.  All of which is to say that "hot data tracking" will likely make
it into the kernel at some point, but it's not clear whether what is merged
will resemble the current patches or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Motivation is typically way higher when someone is trying to get some feature merged.  Once the feature is merged and if they developer who wrote it only cares about that feature is a confined sense, they wouldn't be as willing to make changes to benefits others broadly.  The bar to code acceptable keeps getting higher as a project tries to raise the quality and developers have an increasing pressure to care outside their immediate purview. <br>

OK, but why expect the btrfs developers to rummage around in vfs?  Surely once the idea is proven, anybody can copy the code into vfs, and then the btrfs maintainers can delete their local copy.  <br>

I don't think the patch comes from a Btrfs filesystem developer as such and even if is, it is not uncommon to ask someone trying to get a new feature into one specific area to address the general case to benefit everyone c.f.  suspend blockers or even Reiserfs4<br>

The reason for this being in btrfs is fairly obvious:<br>
<p>
1) btrfs already supports multiple devices under a single volume<br>
2) btrfs had code to figure out which devices have space on them (not just which volume has space, but which target device)<br>
3) btrfs knows which blocks go with which file<br>
<p>
There is a possibility for common code in a few places - "Heat" information (frequency counters of files etc.) could be tracked at the VFS layer although tracking which regions of a file are hot may be hard to do usefully in the VFS - unless the VFS knows file layout.  The code that does relocation of part or all of a file would need to be different for each file system though.<br>
<p>
Also note that the block level does not know file properties, layout, attributes etc. (doing caching using SSD can be done in a limited fashion at the block layer but is less efficient than at the fs layer).<br>

Completely agree.<br>
<p>
The VFS should just be a library of support routines that filesystems can use as needed.<br>
<p>
The best way to develop libraries is to write the code to fit a particular need, then cut/paste it into some other use-case and hack it to work.  Then do that again, and by this time it should be just general enough to work for all three.  Then look at what you have, choose an interface (it will be the wrong choice, but just call it v0.1 and fix it later) and make it into a library.<br>
<p>
Putting something into a library when there is only one user is premature optimisation - the rt f al evl.<br>

My long term dream setup for a higher end machine (8gb RAM, 128GB SSD, 3 TB HDs):<br>

I would like one file system for the whole shebang and I want the RAM as primary cash. The file system should keep track of how frequently files are accessed. <br>
I would like the SDD to be nearly always full with 128 GB of the most accessed files from the HDs. <br>
Most important: Once the system is booted I want the most accessed files from the SSD to be loaded into free RAM (and possibly compressed. Maybe just keeping the compressed Btrfs files)<br>
<p>
Is this something that could potentially do all these things? Is there something that could be even better than this?<br>

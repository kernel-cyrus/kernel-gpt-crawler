           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 28, 2007</br>
           </div>
Once upon a time, block device drivers implemented the same
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure used by char drivers - despite the fact
that block drivers are quite different and many of the
<tt>file_operations</tt> methods had no relevance to them.  By the 2.4
release, though, the block driver API had been significantly reworked, and
<tt>struct file_operations</tt> was no longer used.  Instead, block drivers
have a <tt>block_device_operations</tt> structure containing many of the
driver's exported operations.  "Many" because certain other operations,
including the ones which actually enqueue I/O requests, end up being stored
in the request queue structure instead.
<p>
When the move to <tt>block_device_operations</tt> was done, a number of
methods were carried over directly from the <tt>file_operations</tt>
vector with their prototypes unchanged.  Doing things this way minimized the pain
for driver maintainers, but it led to some interesting interface
artifacts.  For example, consider the <tt>open()</tt> method:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*open)(struct inode *ino, struct file *filp);
</pre>
<p>
When a char device or an actual file is being opened, <tt>filp</tt> points
to the internal <tt>file</tt> structure used by the kernel to manage the
open file.  If a user-space process opens a block device directly,
<tt>filp</tt> will be used in the same way.  Most of the time, though,
block devices are opened by the kernel as a step toward mounting a
filesystem stored there.  In that case, there is no associated <tt>file</tt>
structure.  That's why a perusal of the source reveals code like this:
<p>
<pre>
    /*
     * This crockload is due to bad choice of -&gt;open() type.
     * It will go away.
     * For now, block device -&gt;open() routine must _not_
     * examine anything in 'inode' argument except -&gt;i_rdev.
     */
    struct file fake_file = {};
    struct dentry fake_dentry = {};
    fake_file.f_mode = mode;
    fake_file.f_flags = flags;
    fake_file.f_path.dentry = &amp;fake_dentry;
    fake_dentry.d_inode = bdev-&gt;bd_inode;
</pre>
<p>
Al Viro (who is responsible for much of the current API) has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/246919/">taken a look at this problem</a> and
others.  In the case of <tt>open()</tt>,
there is very little of the information passed in the <tt>inode</tt> and
<tt>file</tt> structure pointers which is actually used by drivers.  And
some of that is used in hazardous ways - any driver which depends on
anything in <tt>fake_file</tt> lasting beyond the <tt>open()</tt> call will
find itself in trouble.  There are other issues with the API as well,
leading Al to propose some significant changes.  The result, which is
almost certain to be merged when it is ready (possibly as soon as 2.6.24),
will be a cleaner block 
driver API - at the cost of changes for every existing driver.
<p>

The first change will be to move some of the flags found in
<tt>f_flags</tt> over to <tt>f_mode</tt>, which is not subject to being
changed by <tt>fcntl()</tt> calls from user space.  As part of the move,
drivers will be expected not to change those flags - or any other part of
the <tt>file</tt> structure.  This change will enable a cleanup of some
code in the much-maligned floppy driver, which currently stores some
information in that structure at <tt>open()</tt> time.
<p>

The new <tt>open()</tt> prototype is projected to be:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*open)(struct block_device *bdev, mode_t mode);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>mode</tt> has the usual read/write flags, but also some of the
other <tt>open()</tt>-time flags like <tt>O_NDELAY</tt>.  This value will
not be changed by the drivers and will not necessarily exist in any sort of
<tt>file</tt> structure.  It will be stored safely in an undisclosed
location by the kernel and will be available at <tt>release()</tt> time,
when some drivers will need access to those flags.
<p>
Speaking of <tt>release()</tt>, that function, too, currently has an old
prototype:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*release)(struct inode *ino, struct file *filp);
</pre>
<p>
In this case, <tt>filp</tt> is often passed as <tt>NULL</tt> by the kernel,
forcing drivers to check the value and implement some sort of default
behavior in the lack of a <tt>file</tt> structure.  But, sometimes, drivers
need to know about some of the flags which were provided at <tt>open()</tt>
time.  So the new <tt>release()</tt> method will look something like:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*release)(struct gendisk *disk, mode_t mode);
</pre>
<p>
The changes do not stop there.  Al points out that there is a bit of
confusion in the <tt>ioctl()</tt> interface:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*ioctl)(struct inode *ino, struct file *filp, unsigned cmd, 
                 unsigned long arg);
    long (*unlocked_ioctl)(struct file *filp, unsigned cmd, unsigned long arg);
    long (*compat_ioctl) (struct file *filp, unsigned cmd, unsigned long arg);
</pre>
<p>
The different versions have different arguments - and even different return
types.  Once again, drivers tend not to care about most of what can be
found in the <tt>inode</tt> and <tt>file</tt> structures - even when those
structures exist.  So the new form of the <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods will be:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*ioctl)(struct block_device *bdev, mode_t mode, unsigned int cmd, 
                 unsigned long arg);
    int (*compat_ioctl)(struct block_device *bdev, mode_t mode, unsigned int cmd,
                        unsigned long arg);
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> is gone: it is arguably past time to
get rid of the big kernel lock (BKL) in the block <tt>ioctl()</tt>
implementation.  So any driver still using the locked version
(<tt>ioctl()</tt> in the old API) will be modified to take the BKL
internally.  Any block driver which still requires the BKL is probably in
need of a more serious review, though.
<p>

As of this writing, there have been no arguments against the change.  <a
href="/Articles/247100/">The word from Linus</a> is:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	From your description, I have no objections - everything sounds
	good. My only concern is how painful the patch ends up being (and a
	worry about whether this will affect a metric truck-load of
	external modules? That said, I can't really see us worrying about
	those)
</div>
<p>
Al claims to have a patch in progress and ready to be posted soon, and that
the amount of pain should be relatively small - for in-tree drivers,
anyway.  For those maintaining out-of-tree block drivers, the writing is on
the wall: a significant API change is coming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 12, 2018</br>
           </div>
Variable-length arrays (VLAs) have a non-constant size that is determined (and
which can vary) at run time; they are supported by the ISO&nbsp;C99
standard.   Use of VLAs in the
kernel has long been discouraged but not prohibited, so there are naturally
numerous VLA instances to be found.  A recent push to remove VLAs from the
kernel entirely has gained momentum, but it ran into an interesting snag on
the way.
<p>
A VLA is simply an array that is declared with a non-constant dimension.
For example, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/lib/btree.c#L639"><tt>btree_merge()</tt></a>
begins like this:
<p>
<pre>
    int btree_merge(struct btree_head *target, struct btree_head *victim,
		    struct btree_geo *geo, gfp_t gfp)
    {
	unsigned long key[geo-&gt;keylen];
	unsigned long dup[geo-&gt;keylen];
</pre>
<p>
The length of both the <tt>key</tt> and <tt>dup</tt> arrays is determined
by the value stored in the <tt>keylen</tt> field of the passed-in
<tt>geo</tt> structure.  The compiler cannot know what that value will be
at compile time, so those arrays must be allocated at run time.  For this
reason, VLAs must be automatic variables, allocated on the stack.
<p>
As an extension to the language, GCC also allows the use of VLAs within
structures.  The LLVM Clang developers have refused to add this extension,
though; that has led developers interested in building the kernel with
Clang to work to remove VLAs from structures in the kernel.  C99 VLAs are
supported by Clang, though, so developers working on Clang compatibility
have not paid much attention to them.
<p>
Since VLAs are standard C, one might wonder why there is a desire to remove
them.  One reason is that they add a bit of run-time overhead, since the size of
a VLA must be calculated every time that the function declaring it is
called.  But the bigger issue has to do with stack usage.  Stacks in the
kernel are small, so every kernel developer must be constantly aware of how
much stack space each function is using.  VLAs, since they are automatic
variables whose size is determined at run time, add a degree of uncertainty
to a function's stack usage. 
Changes in distant code might result in a VLA growing in surprising ways.
If an attacker finds a way to influence the size of a VLA, the potential
for all kinds of mischief arises.
<p>
For these reasons, Linus Torvalds recently <a
href="/Articles/749089/">declared</a> that "<q>using VLA's is actively
bad not just for security worries, but simply because VLA's are a really
horribly bad idea in general in the kernel</q>".  That added some energy
to the VLA-removal work that was already underway.  In the process, though,
Kees Cook discovered an interesting surprise: a number of VLAs in the
kernel are not actually variable in length and were never meant to be seen
as such by the compiler.
<p>
<h4>Accidental VLAs and the difficult story of max()</h4>
<p>

A useful tool in the quest to remove VLAs from the kernel is the GCC
<tt>-Wvla</tt> option, which issues warnings when VLAs are declared.  Cook
<a href="/Articles/749091/">found</a>, though, that it was issuing warnings
for arrays that were meant to be of constant size; one of them was this bit
of code from <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/lib/vsprintf.c#L741"><tt>lib/vsprintf.c</tt></a>:
<p>
<pre>
    #define RSRC_BUF_SIZE	((2 * sizeof(resource_size_t)) + 4)
    #define FLAG_BUF_SIZE	(2 * sizeof(res-&gt;flags))
    #define DECODED_BUF_SIZE	sizeof("[mem - 64bit pref window disabled]")
    #define RAW_BUF_SIZE	sizeof("[mem - flags 0x]")
	char sym[max(2*RSRC_BUF_SIZE + DECODED_BUF_SIZE,
		     2*RSRC_BUF_SIZE + FLAG_BUF_SIZE + RAW_BUF_SIZE)];
</pre>
<p>
The length of <tt>sym</tt> is clearly constant and can be determined at
compile time, but GCC warns that <tt>sym</tt> is a VLA anyway.  The problem
turns out to be the kernel's <tt>max()</tt> macro, which generates an expression
that is not recognized as constant by the compiler.
<p>
If one looks on page 87 of the original edition of <a
href="https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition"><i>The
C&nbsp;Programming Language</i></a> by Kernighan and Ritchie, one will find
the classic definition of the <tt>max()</tt> macro:
<p>
<pre>
    #define max(A, B)  ((A) &gt; (B) ? (A) : (B))
</pre>
<p>
There are some problems with this definition that make it
unsuitable for kernel use, including the double-evaluation of the arguments
and the lack of any sort of type checking.  So a lot of effort has gone
into the kernel's <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15.9/source/include/linux/kernel.h#L804">special
version of <tt>max()</tt></a>:
<p>
<pre>
    #define __max(t1, t2, max1, max2, x, y) ({		\
	t1 max1 = (x);					\
	t2 max2 = (y);					\
	(void) (&amp;max1 == &amp;max2);			\
	max1 &gt; max2 ? max1 : max2; })

    #define max(x, y)					\
	__max(typeof(x), typeof(y),			\
	      __UNIQUE_ID(max1_), __UNIQUE_ID(max2_),	\
	      x, y)
</pre>
<p>

For the curious, the outer <tt>max()</tt> macro uses <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15.9/source/include/linux/compiler-gcc.h#L189">__UNIQUE_ID()</a></tt>
to generate two unique variable names.  Those names, along with the types
of the two values and the values themselves, are passed to
<tt>__max()</tt>.  That macro declares two new variables (using the unique
names) and assigns the passed-in values to them; this is done to prevent
<tt>x</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>y</tt> from being evaluated more than once.
Pointers to those two variables are then compared while discarding the
result; this is done to force the compiler to issue an error 
if the two operands do not have compatible types.  Finally, the
two values themselves are compared to determine which one is greater.
<p>
It was initially assumed that GCC was simply not smart enough to understand
that the result of this whole mess was still constant, so it created a VLA
instead.  Torvalds eventually <a href="/Articles/749093/">figured out</a>
the real problem, though: the C&nbsp;standard makes a distinction between a
"constant value" and a "constant expression".  Array dimensions are
required to be constant expressions, but the <tt>max()</tt> macro does not
qualify as such.  As Torvalds pointed out, the warning from GCC is thus somewhat
misleading; while the compiler is emitting the VLA code for these arrays,
they are not actually variable in length, and the problem is more a matter
of syntax.
<p>
Regardless of the reason for their creation, it clearly would be a good
thing to get rid of these
"accidental" VLAs.  What followed was an effort to rewrite <tt>max()</tt>;
it was the sort of quest that the kernel community is so good at mustering.  At one
point, Cook <a href="/Articles/749095/">came up with this</a>:
<p>
<pre>
    #define __single_eval_max(t1, t2, max1, max2, x, y) ({	\
 	t1 max1 = (x);					\
 	t2 max2 = (y);					\
 	(void) (&amp;max1 == &amp;max2);			\
 	max1 &gt; max2 ? max1 : max2; })

    #define __max(t1, t2, x, y)						\
	__builtin_choose_expr(__builtin_constant_p(x) &amp;&amp;		\
			      __builtin_constant_p(y),			\
			      (t1)(x) &gt; (t2)(y) ? (t1)(x) : (t2)(y),	\
			      __single_eval_max(t1, t2,			\
						__UNIQUE_ID(max1_),	\
						__UNIQUE_ID(max2_),	\
						x, y))

    #define max(x, y)	__max(typeof(x), typeof(y), x, y)
</pre>
<p>
Essentially, this version uses more macro trickery to short out much of the
<tt>max()</tt> logic when the two operands are constants.  It worked well —
on recent compilers.  The results turned out to not be so pleasing on older
compilers, though.  Initially there was some thought of revisiting the
discussion on <a href="/Articles/748074/">deprecating support for older
compilers</a>, but then 4.8.5 was <a href="/Articles/749097/">reported</a>
to fail as well.  At that point, 
Cook <a href="/Articles/749096/">threw up his hands</a> and gave up on
creating a better <tt>max()</tt>.  The solution going forward is likely to
be what he suggested when he first discovered the problem: create a new
<tt>SIMPLE_MAX()</tt> macro that is really just the original Kernighan and
Ritchie <tt>max()</tt> with a different name.  It is good enough for
constant array dimensions.
<p>
<h4>Finishing the job</h4>
<p>
Now that this discussion has run its course, the process of eliminating all
of the non-accidental VLAs can continue.  There are just over 200 of them
in the kernel; many of them are easily replaced with
ordinary fixed-length arrays.  Several developers have posted patches
eliminating VLAs from various kernel subsystems.  Getting rid of all of
them will probably take some time; a few instances may require fairly deep
analysis to determine the real maximum length and, perhaps, internal API
changes.  Eventually, though, we will get to a point where a <tt>-Wvla</tt>
build generates no warnings.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Really? I think the kernel developers want to additionally make sure the two expressions have the same type, and cause a compile-time error if they do not.</p>
<p>My C++ is quite rusty but here’s my version:</p>

template &lt;typename T1, typename T2,

              std::is_same&lt;typename std::decay&lt;T1&gt;::type,
                           typename std::decay&lt;T2&gt;::type&gt;::value,
              T1&gt;::type&gt;
inline constexpr auto maxx(T1 a, T2 b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}

int test(void) {
  int a = maxx(12, 14);         // should compile
  int b = maxx(12ul, 14l);      // should fail
  int c[maxx(17, 19)];          // should compile

I could be wrong but that seems unnecessary. std::max will already fail to compile if you give it two different integer types. You just have to define it with a single type for both both parameters.<br>
<p>
template&lt;class T&gt;<br>
constexpr T max(const T&amp; left, const T&amp; right);<br>

Also works for pass-by-value.<br>

Yes; it's defined with one template parameter only, so if you give it two different types, you'll either need to cast one or (better) say explicitly which max() you want, e.g. std::max&lt;int&gt;(a, b).

      Not sure what your point is, but <tt>const</tt> variables are not constant expressions in C.

This creates a VLA:

<pre>
const int count = 5;
int array[count];

      The original version, annotated:

<pre>
#define __max(t1, t2, max1, max2, x, y) ({	\
    t1 max1 = (x);	\    // max1 is a non-const t1
    t2 max2 = (y);	\    // max2 is a non-const t2
    (void) (&amp;max1 == &amp;max2);	\
        // compute address of a non-const t1
        // compute address of a non-const t2
        // compare addresses
        // don't emit code for the last three lines
        // see questions below
    max1 &gt; max2 ? max1 : max2; })
 </pre>

At what point do the compiler's pointer-aliasing optimization rules kick in?  Does the compiler realize the pointers are not used, or must it assume that because these pointers exist, that max1 and max2 might be modified before the comparison?  Does the &amp; operator force the compiler to instantiate max1 and max2, then later elide the code but not forget the side-effect?  Does even asking this question cause the compiler to be unable to reduce this to a compile-time constant, and turn this into a VLA instead?

Do variable-length arrays have to go on the stack?  Could the compiler generate code to call some allocation function, and then some free function when leaving the stack frame?  These would have to be specified by the programmer somehow as compiler options, so it would be un-C-like, but might give a way to have the convenient syntax of VLAs while doing memory management the way kernel programmers like.<br>

      The kernel community tends to be less than thrilled about that kind of behind-the-curtain magic; it obscures things in a setting where developers really need to know exactly what is happening.  There's also the little issue of figuring out which GFP flags to use.   So I don't think I see anything like this happening.

if you needn't why you should use? 90% of cases you can use fixed size vectors. About 10% you can find a solid way avoiding vla. Why do kernel's devs enable warning on VLA by default? this will reduce the usage in short time avoiding wrong coding style in the future.<br>

That's UB with or without VLAs. Pointer arithmetic is only defined within the same object (or one past the end of an array).<br>

      By the way, is it allowed to have a pointer that is one past the end of a variable that isn't an array? Something like this:
<pre>
void print_ints(const int *begin, const int *end) {
  for (; begin &lt; end; ++begin) {
    printf("%d\n", *begin);
  }
}

int main() {
  int i = 42;
  print_ints(&amp;i, &amp;i + 1);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

When compiling this with -fsanitize=address, it doesn't complain, so it's probably OK… but still, i isn't technically an array, right?<br>

So it sounds to me like your code is fine.<br>

Inline functions are not compile time...isn't it ? So you can't declare global variables using max.<br>

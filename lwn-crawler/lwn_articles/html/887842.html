           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 17, 2022</br>

CPU scheduling can be a challenging task; the scheduler must ensure that
every process gets a fair share of the available CPU time while, at the
same time, respecting CPU affinities, avoiding the migration of processes
away from their cached memory contents, and keeping all CPUs in the system
busy.  Even then, users can become grumpy if specific processes do not get
their CPU share quickly; from that comes years of debates over desktop
responsiveness, for example.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220311161406.23497-1-vincent.guittot@linaro.org/">latency-nice
priority proposal</a> recently resurrected by Vincent Guittot aims to
provide a new tool to help latency-sensitive applications get their CPU
time more quickly.
<p>
Over the years, numerous approaches have been used to try to improve the
response time of important processes.  The traditional Unix "nice" value
can be used to raise a process's priority, for example.  That can work, but
a process's niceness does not directly translate into latency; it controls
how much of the available CPU time the process can consume, but not when
the process can actually run.  Using the realtime priorities <i>will</i>
cause the scheduler to run a process quickly, especially if realtime
preemption is enabled, but a process running at that priority can also take
over the system.
<p>
The latency-nice concept is a different approach that tries to address
those problems; it applies to the completely fair scheduler used for most
processes, so no 
realtime priorities are needed.  It adds a second nice value which,
mirroring the existing nice value, is a number between -20 and&nbsp;19.
The lower the number, the higher the priority, so the highest-priority
latency-nice value is&nbsp;-20.  As with traditional nice values, any process can
increase its latency-nice 
setting, but lowering it requires the <tt>CAP_SYS_NICE</tt> capability.
<p>
The traditional nice value works by regulating how much CPU time a process
may consume relative to others on the system; processes with a lower nice
value get more CPU time.  Changing the latency-nice value, instead, does
not change the amount of CPU time a process may consume.  It does, however,
make a difference in <i>when</i> that time will be made available.
Processes with lower latency-nice values are deemed to be more
latency-sensitive, and thus should not have to wait as long before being
able to use the CPU time that is available to them.
<p>
With that model, the implementation of latency nice is relatively
straightforward.  Whenever a blocked process wakes, the scheduler must
decide whether to run it immediately or to put it into a run queue and make
it wait for a CPU.  A number of factors go into that decision now; the
latency-nice mechanism adds another.  If the new process has a higher
latency-nice priority than the process that is running in a CPU, and that
new process has available CPU time in its current slice, then the new
process can preempt the running process.  The new process does not get any
more CPU time than before, but it has the right to obtain the CPU more
quickly when it has time available.
<p>
Similarly, a process with a higher latency-nice value (and thus, a lower
priority) will not preempt other running processes.  It will thus tend to
get its entire time allotment toward the end of the slice, once the
higher-priority processes have used their time.  This process, too, will
get all of the time that it is entitled to, but it will not block others
and will, because it does not preempt others,  cause fewer context switches
in general. 
<p>
Traditional nice values are set with the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/nice.2.html"><tt>nice()</tt>
system call</a>.  Latency nice, instead, is controlled with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html"><tt>sched_setattr()</tt></a>.
A new field (<tt>latency_nice</tt>) has been added to the
<tt>sched_attr</tt> structure passed to that system call, and the
<tt>SCHED_FLAG_LATENCY_NICE</tt> flag is provided to indicate that a new
latency-nice value is being requested.  Latency nice can also be managed
using the scheduler control-group controller; a new knob (<tt>latency</tt>)
has been provided for that purpose.
<p>
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220311161406.23497-6-vincent.guittot@linaro.org/">This
patch</a> in the series includes some benchmark results showing how latency
nice works.  Running the <tt>hackbench</tt> benchmark with a high
latency-nice value yields better performance due to the lower number of
preemptions that take place.  Throwing in a <tt>cyclictest</tt> run, at a
low latency-nice value, demonstrates greatly reduced latency results for
that test.  Overall, it would seem that the patch set works as intended.
<p>
Previously, this work had been developed by Parth Shah; the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200228090755.22829-1-parth@linux.ibm.com/">fifth
revision of the patch set</a> was posted in February 2020.  The work had
acquired some Reviewed-by tags by that point, but it stalled thereafter.
Interestingly, it had gotten as far as adding the infrastructure to manage
the latency-nice value, but had not actually implemented any new semantics
in the scheduler.  At that time, there were a few ideas circulating on how
the system might respond to the latency-nice settings and <a
href="/Articles/820659/">a discussion on latency nice</a> was held at the
OSPM 2020 gathering, but no seeming consensus  on the right approach emerged.
<p>
Two years later, Guittot has dusted this work off and added the wakeup
implementation described above.  As of this writing, there have been few
comments on this work.  Improving response times for important processes
has been on many developers' wishlists for a long time, though.  If further
testing shows that the latency-nice mechanism represents progress in that
direction, then this new push may well be the one that gets this work into
the mainline kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hm, I&#x27;ve actually thought GPUs running shaders/CUDA kernels/whatever similar code would actually be non-preemptable, probably at a hardware level so that while you can kill a stuck piece of code, that operation is expensive enough (something close to GPU reset) that you can&#x27;t realistically do it in a scheduler. Of course I might be completely mistaken.<br>

There&#x27;s a useful overview of NVIDIA GPU preemption at <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/10325/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review/10">https://www.anandtech.com/show/10325/the-nvidia-geforce-g...</a><br>
<p>
In older (pre-2016) architectures they only did preemption at draw call boundaries (where a draw call is a set of triangles with the same rendering state (e.g. same pixel shader), covering potentially millions of pixels, or a single compute shader running over an arbitrarily large N-dimensional grid, etc).<br>
<p>
With newer architectures they can do pixel-level preemption (i.e. pausing in the middle of an arbitrary triangle, but they still have to run each pixel shader invocation to completion), where the context switch takes around 0.1msecs (i.e. it&#x27;s pretty expensive but you can probably afford a few switches per frame). They can also do instruction-level preemption for compute shaders, but it has to copy a load of GPU state (including megabytes of register files and L1 caches) into VRAM so it&#x27;s going to be very expensive. The latter is mainly useful so compute shaders that take many seconds to execute won&#x27;t hang the whole system - Windows gets impatient after 2 seconds and thinks the GPU has crashed and resets it - and has some other niche benefits like debugging compute shaders on the same GPU that the debugger&#x27;s UI is running on.<br>

the idle scheduling that the sibling mentions is exactly what you want<br>

is a frequent setup I use when doing large or long compiles since it puts it into SCHED_IDLE, low priority, and then the io idle class also.  The job will take longer but it won&#x27;t be allowed to impact any other tasks (unless they&#x27;re also set to this same level).<br>

Is there (or could there be) a similar parameter for tuning per-thread aggressiveness of CPU migration?  I am thinking of a case where two threads with aggressive latency-nice values may contend for the same CPU.  I wonder if addressing preemption is only a part of a larger problem.<br>

I wonder if this will help Linux audio. For example, allowing DAW software to be scheduled with better latency priorities. <br>

In order to help DAWs or avoid audio drop outs, lowering the latency_nice value needs to be allowed for ordinary processes. Or simply processes that have an audio device opened.<br>
<p>
If you download a DAW AppImage, or simply compile and run an audio application as ordinary user, you cannot benefit from priority settings hidden behind suid bits or CAP_SYS_NICE.<br>
I.e. you still have to run audio applications with drop outs or huge buffers which prevents an entire class of interactive audio uses.<br>

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. If you use a sound server, eg jack/pipewire with a high priority, your sound application registers a callback that gets run in a thread which inherits that priority. You don&#x27;t need extra permissions except for the sound server.<br>
<p>
See this excerpt from jack.h :<br>
<p>
/**<br>
 * Tell the Jack server to call @a thread_callback in the RT thread.<br>
 * Typical use are in conjunction with @a jack_cycle_wait and @a jack_cycle_signal functions.<br>
 * The code in the supplied function must be suitable for real-time<br>
 * execution.  That means that it cannot call functions that might<br>
 * block for a long time. This includes malloc, free, printf,<br>
 * pthread_mutex_lock, sleep, wait, poll, select, pthread_join,<br>
 * pthread_cond_wait, etc, etc. See<br>
 * <a rel="nofollow" href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/docs/design/design.html#SECTION00411000000000000000">http://jackit.sourceforge.net/docs/design/design.html#SEC...</a><br>
 * for more information.<br>
 *<br>
 * NOTE: this function cannot be called while the client is activated<br>
 * (after jack_activate has been called.)<br>
 *<br>
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.<br>

Current state is pretty bad.  With current default settings, on a fat 64-thread box with 256GB ram even a mere kernel compile slows interactive tasks to a crawl, despite leaving a few threads unused.<br>

Honestly, that sounds odd. With that kind of fatty machine, it is highly unlikely for just a mere kernel, to compile. But, I can believe you that you probably saw something specific. What are those?? What tool did you use to figure out it is lagging behind or causing trouble? <br>
<p>
Can you please give it a shot kernelshark, a tool to see, where it clogs? I am wildly assuming you have knowledge about it. It has a CLI and GUI too. Which might help you to pinpoint where it is clogging, which spew and hinder other stuff in the system. <br>
<p>
I am sure you have looked at the spewing messages in some place in the system to figure out, what is gobbling up all the resources, so the system is on its knees.<br>
<p>
How are you compiling the kernel? From disk or in RAM?? The &quot;default&quot; means I am assuming you haven&#x27;t made any changes to the config, is that the case? Then it might eliminate other possibilities too. <br>
<p>
It is a pure hunch...I probably grossly misunderstood your problem.<br>
<p>
Last, what other program are you running simultaneously while building the kernel? Any memory specific,I meant to say, some apps are pretty memory hungry, over the ages and no improvement has done them.<br>
<p>
Sorry about the rambling. <br>

This sounds simple. I&#x27;m sure the devil is in the details (I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m complaining; I&#x27;m not doing anything very latency sensitive). Otherwise it would be nice to understand why this hasn&#x27;t existed for like 15 years. IOW, why is it not as simple as it sounds?.<br>

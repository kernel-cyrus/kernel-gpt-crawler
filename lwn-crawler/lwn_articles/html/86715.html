<h1>The merging of anon_vma and 4G/4G</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 26, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
Immediately prior to releasing 2.6.7-rc1, Linus merged the full remaining
set of virtual memory patches from Andrea Arcangeli and Hugh Dickins,
including the anon_vma code.  This action has raised eyebrows in some
quarters; some developers had been under the impression that 2.6 was a
stable kernel series.  Nobody seems to doubt that the object-based reverse
mapping code is a good idea in the long run, but merging it now strikes
some developers as 
unlikely to increase the stability of the 2.6 kernel in the near future.
<p>
Linus <a href="/Articles/86718/">defends</a> the change in this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It's not "fundamental", in that the reverse mapping is still
	done. It's just done in a slightly different way.  Going to rmap
	was a _fundamental_ change to how we did VM. In contrast, this was
	just an "implementation detail".
</div>
<p>
Most "implementation details" fit into rather less than 40 individual
patches, do not involve difficult special cases (such as making all uses of
<tt>mremap()</tt> work correctly), and avoid making significant changes to
core parts of the virtual memory subsystem.  That said, one should note
that the core <i>decision-making</i> VM code has not been changed; the
algorithm for choosing pages to move into and out of memory is the same as
before.  It is also notable that there have been almost no VM-related
problem reports since 2.6.7-rc1 was released.  This particular change may
just work out in the short term after all.
<p>

A related topic is the 4G/4G patch, which separates kernel and user space
entirely so that each can make full use of the 4G virtual address space on
32-bit systems.  This patch has been considered for merging for some time,
but has never quite found its way in.  Most developers see it as an ugly
hack (though, perhaps, a necessary one), and there is fear of the
(possibly overstated) performance overhead that the 4G/4G mode imposes.
Even so, some people wonder when this patch might be merged.
<p>

The answer seems to be "never, if at all possible."  The motivations behind
this patch are (1)&nbsp;to make more kernel-space low memory available on
large-memory systems, and (2)&nbsp;to provide a larger virtual address
space for applications.  The first reason may well have just become moot;
the anon_vma patch was merged because, among other things, it significantly
reduces the amount of low memory used by the VM subsystem.  The initial <a
href="/Articles/86723/">reports</a> suggest that the current VM code
handles 32GB of memory nicely on 32-bit systems.  Since 32-bit systems
rarely come more heavily loaded than that (so far), it is thought that the VM has
gotten as good as it needs to be on those systems.

<p>
The real hope, however, is that a serious transition to 64-bit systems will
happen before too long.  The x86 architecture has been stretched much
further than anybody would have expected it to go, and x86_64 makes the
transition so easy that there is very little reason not to do it.  The
4G/4G patch is likely to hang around (and be included by some distributors)
for some time; if nothing else, all of the currently-deployed monster x86
systems are likely to go on running for a while yet.  But the mainline
kernel may just get away with saying "switch to 64-bit" and leaving that
particular patch out.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <i>and there is fear of the (possibly overstated) performance overhead that the 4G/4G mode imposes.</i>
<p>
Where I work we have tested the 4G/4G patch in a 2.4 kernel. Our app is a network server running in an poll() based event loop; it needs a large datastructure in memory and is receiving and sending small message requests about that large data set. Bottom line, our app is VERY syscall dominated. To get more user space memory we looked into the 4G/4G patch.
<p>
The performance impact was enormous, 30-50% loss of requests per second. Swapping memory spaces for every syscall killed our app so much that it didn't even need the greater memory space.

      As a counterpoint, my employer runs farms that are overwhelmingly compute-bound.  (Actually, much of their time is spent waiting on memory bus latency, because there is no working set.)  4G/4G would have no effect on performance, but would allow us to continue using the same hosts longer, as the data set continues to grow.  Replacing those hundreds of hosts with Opterons will be a big effort and a big expense.  It will happen eventually, but certainly not all at once.  Anything that stretches the lifetime of the old hosts is a great boon.

      This is a really rare situation.  In the interest of reduced complexity, I think it makes sense for Linus to not include it in the main kernel.  Those people that need it, such as yourself, probably would not mind applying it manually...?

      Two points: <br>(a) It is no miracle that nobody complains about the memory management  <br>    in 2.6.7-rc1. A large distributor has based their 2.6 kernel <br>    on Andrea's patches and a lot of testing has happended on the <br>    kernel with various desktop and enterprise workloads. <br>    These tests have resulted in a number of bug reports, but they <br>    have been analyzed and addressed quickly. <br>    The good functioning is the result of the good design, the deep <br>    understanding of MM by Andrea and the heavy testing. <br>(b) If 4:4 can be avoided, it should. <br>    MySQL has shown some numbers at the user conference that showed <br>    75% higher performance for the small working set when comparing <br>    the RHAS smp(3:1) to the hugemem(4:4) kernels. For the large  <br>    working set, the 3:1 kernel was still 19% faster. <br>    With the objrmap, anon_vma and prio_tree work, we can now avoid 4:4.

      &gt; The real hope, however, is that a serious transition to 64-bit systems will happen before too long.<p>I'd suggest looking at the history of the PDP-11 for some idea of what &quot;too long&quot; might mean.  Despite the various efforts that DEC made (notably compatability mode on the VAX), the 11s continued for many years and continued to have to deal with the limitations of a 16 bit address space.  I certainly hope Linux doesn't ever have to deal with separate I+D or overlays, but if Linux is going to continue to keep an eye on making old and cheap hardware run fast, I would expect that the developers will be looking at how to shoehorn more into a 32 bit address space for years at least.<br>

The kernel's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/basics.html#c.printk"><tt>printk()</tt></a>
function seems like it should be relatively simple; all it does is format a
string and output it to the kernel logs.  That simplicity hides a lot of
underlying complexity, though, and that complexity is why kernel developers
are still unhappy with <tt>printk()</tt> after 28 years.  At the 2019 Linux
Plumbers Conference, John Ogness <a
href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/290/">explained</a>
where the complexity in <tt>printk()</tt> comes from and what is being done
to improve the situation.
<p>
The core problem, Ogness began, comes from the fact that kernel code must
be able to call <tt>printk()</tt> from any context.  Calls from atomic
context prevent it from blocking; calls from non-maskable interrupts
(NMIs) can even 
rule out the use of spinlocks.  At the same time, output from
<tt>printk()</tt> is crucial when the kernel runs into trouble; developers
do not want to lose any printed messages even if the kernel is crashing or
hanging.  Those messages should appear on console devices, which may be
attached to serial ports, graphic adapters, or network connections.
Meanwhile, <tt>printk()</tt> cannot interfere with the normal operation of
the system.
<p>
In other words, he summarized, <tt>printk()</tt> is seemingly simple and
definitely ubiquitous, but it has to be wired deeply into the system.
<p>
<h4>The path to the present</h4>
<p>
Ogness then launched into a detailed history of <tt>printk()</tt>; see <a
href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/290/attachments/276/463/lpc2019_jogness_printk.pdf">his
slides [PDF]</a> for all the details.  The first kernel release — v0.01 —
included a <tt>printk()</tt> implementation; it was synchronous and simply
pushed messages directly to a TTY port with a bit of assembly code.  It was
reliable, but not particularly scalable; once the kernel started supporting
multiple CPUs, things needed to change.
<p>
Version 0.99.7a added console registration; the "log level" abstraction was
added in v0.99.13k.  The <tt>bust_spinlocks()</tt> mechanism, which
prevents waiting for spinlocks when the system is crashing and "goes

<a href="/Articles/801017/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/JohnOgness-sm.jpg" alt="[John Ogness]"
title="John Ogness" class="lthumb"></a>

against everything everybody has learned", was added in 2.4.0.  With
2.4.10, big changes to <tt>printk()</tt> made it asynchronous.  By 2.6.26,
<tt>printk()</tt> was causing large latency spikes; kernel developers dealt
with this problem by ignoring <tt>printk()</tt> in the latency tracer, thus
sweeping it under the rug.  The 3.4 release added <a
href="/Articles/492125/">structured logging</a>, sequence numbers, and the
<tt>/dev/kmsg</tt> interface.  The "safe buffers" mechanism, used for
printing in NMI context, showed up in 4.10.  A problem where one CPU
could get stuck outputting messages indefinitely was (somewhat) addressed
in 4.15.  In 5.0, the concept of caller identifiers was added.
<p>
So <tt>printk()</tt> has seen a lot of development over the years, but
there are still a number of open issues.  One of them is the raw spinlock
used to protect the ring buffer; it cannot be taken in NMI context, so
<tt>printk()</tt> must output to the lockless safe buffers instead.  That
will create bogus timestamps when the messages are finally copied to the real
ring buffer, can lose messages, and cause the buffers to not be flushed when CPUs
don't go offline properly.
<p>
Then, there is the issue of the console drivers, which are slow but are
nonetheless called with interrupts disabled.  Most console devices are not
designed to work in a kernel-panic situation, so they are not reliable when
they may be needed most.
<p>
Other problems include the fact that all log levels are treated equally by
<tt>printk()</tt>; chatter treated like urgent information can create
latency problems, causing some users to restrict the levels that are
actually logged.  The problem with one CPU being stuck logging forever has
been fixed, but the last CPU to come along and take over log output can
still be saddled with a lot of work.  That makes any <tt>printk()</tt> call
potentially expensive.  The whole <tt>bust_spinlocks()</tt> mechanism can
be described as "ignoring locks and hoping for the best"; there should be a
better way, he said.
<p>
<h4>The better way</h4>
<p>
The difficulties with <tt>printk()</tt> over the years, Ogness said, come
down to the tension between non-interference and reliability.  Trying to
achieve both goals in the same place has been shown not to work, so a
better approach would be to split them apart.  Non-interference can be
addressed by making <tt>printk()</tt> fully preemptable, making the ring
buffer safe in all contexts, and moving console handling to dedicated
kernel threads.  Reliability, instead, can be achieved by providing a
synchronous channel for important messages, an "atomic consoles" concept,
and the notion of "emergency messages".
<p>
Both goals depend on support from the <tt>printk()</tt> ring buffer.  This
buffer has multiple concurrent readers and a single writer; it is stored
contiguously in memory and is protected by a special spinlock (the "CPU
lock") that can be 
acquired multiple times on the same CPU.  This lock, he said, feels a lot
like the old big kernel lock.
<p>
Like any self-respecting kernel-development project, the <tt>printk()</tt>
work starts with the creation of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190807222634.1723-1-john.ogness@linutronix.de/">a
new ring buffer</a> meant to address the problems with the current one.  It
is fully lockless, supporting multiple readers and writers in all
contexts.  Metadata has been pushed out to a separate descriptor mechanism;
it handles tasks like timestamps and sequencing.  The ring buffer has some nice
features, but it is also complicated, including no less than nine
memory-barrier pairs.  It is hard to document and hard to review; he is
also not convinced that the multiple writer support — which adds a lot of
the complexity — is really needed.
<p>
The addition of the per-console kernel threads serves to decouple
<tt>printk()</tt> calls from console handling.  Each console will now go as
fast as it can, and each can have its own log level.  Shifting the
responsibility for consoles simplifies a lot of things, but leads to some
unresolved questions about locking and whether a thread-based
implementation can be relied upon to always get the messages out.  But
reliability, Ogness said, will be handled by other mechanisms; the
per-console threads are a non-interference mechanism.
<p>
For reliability, the plan is to add an "atomic console" concept.  Consoles
with this support would have a <tt>write_atomic()</tt> method that can be
expected to work in any context.  This method is defined to operate
synchronously, meaning that it will slow down the system considerably;
it is thus only to be used for emergency messages.  The advantage is that there
is no longer any need for <tt>bust_spinlocks()</tt> or the global
<tt>oops_in_progress</tt> variable.
<p>
The challenge is creating console drivers that can actually implement
<tt>write_atomic()</tt>.  He did an implementation for consoles attached to
an 8250 UART; it was "not trivial".  There will almost certainly be a lot
of systems that never get atomic-console support, so some other sort of
solution will be needed.  He said that options include creating a special
console that fills a memory area instead, trying to print synchronously
outside of atomic context, or just "falling back to the current
craziness".
<p>
Associated with atomic consoles is the idea of "emergency messages" that
must go out right away.  The biggest problem here may be deciding which
messages are important enough to warrant that treatment.  Log levels are
"kind of a gray area" and, he said, not really the way to go.  There are
only a few situations where <tt>printk()</tt> output is really that
important; the right solution might be to hook into macros like
<tt>BUG()</tt>.
<p>
Ogness concluded by noting that this work began in February, with
the current version having been posted in August.  Most of the features
described above have been implemented, he said, giving developers
"something to play with".
<p>
<h4>Further discussion</h4>
<p>
A separate session was held later in the conference; your editor was
unfortunately unable to attend.  Ogness has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87k1acz5rx.fsf@linutronix.de/">a summary</a> of the
conclusions that were reached there, though.  He thanked the community for
its participation in this meeting, which "<q>certainly
saved hundreds of hours of reading/writing emails</q>".
<p>
From the summary, it seems that <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190704103321.10022-1-pmladek@suse.com/">an
alternative ring buffer implementation</a> posted by Petr Mladek will be
used instead; it is much simpler and thus easier to review.  Ogness has
ported the rest of his work to use this buffer and shown that it works.
The per-console kernel threads will be used.
<p>
The "emergency messages" idea seems to have been superseded by the idea of
an "emergency state" that affects the system as a whole.  When the kernel
is in that state, all messages will be flushed using the
<tt>write_atomic()</tt> callback where it is available.  Flushing to
consoles without atomic support will not be supported.  The CPU lock will
remain, but its purpose will be to synchronize the console threads when the
system is in the emergency state.
<p>
There will be other changes, including the addition of a
<tt>pr_flush()</tt> function that will wait for all messages to be sent out
to all consoles.  Patches implementing all this work have not yet been
posted, but presumably they can be expected soon.

The virtio ring buffer is most frequently used as a ring of pointers to other buffers. This wreaks havoc with performance as the virtual machine monitor is constantly having to (re) map the pointed-to buffer addresses to host-physical from guest-physical. Just something to consider. The newer virtio spec has a good solution to this (anti) feature, but it is only recently in the mainline kernel, so most distributions still have to deal with what virtio calls indirect buffers. It's easy to overlook the performance impact of "indirect" memory access and function calls.<br>

You already suggest how the story will continue: one person with a clean soul will need to be found to carry the one ring (buffer) to the source, er, I mean, the big Vulcan of evil, to finally burn it fire and free the world...<br>

At the end of October, the <a href="/Articles/738975/">KAISER</a> patch set
was unveiled; this work separates the page tables used by the kernel from
those belonging to user space in an attempt to address x86 processor bugs
that can disclose the layout of the kernel to an attacker.  Those patches
have seen significant work in the weeks since their debut, but they appear
to be approaching a final state.  It seems like an appropriate time for
another look.  
<p>
This work has since been renamed to "kernel page-table isolation" or KPTI,
but the objective remains the same: split the page tables, which are
currently shared between user and kernel space, into two sets of tables,
one for each side.  This is a fundamental change to how the kernel's memory
management works and is the sort of thing that one would ordinarily expect
to see debated for years, especially given its associated performance
impact.  KPTI remains on the fast track, though.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/64a48099b3b31568ac45716b7fafcb74a0c2fcfe">A
set of preparatory 
patches</a> was merged into the mainline after the 4.15-rc4 release — when only
important fixes would ordinarily be allowed — and the rest seems destined
for the 4.16 merge window.  Many of the core kernel developers have clearly
put a lot of time into this work, and Linus Torvalds is <a
href="/Articles/741882/">expecting</a> it to be backported to the long-term
stable kernels.
<p>
KPTI, in other words, has all the markings of a security patch being
readied under pressure from a deadline.  Just in case there are any smug
ARM-based readers out there, it's worth noting that there is <a
href="/Articles/740393/">an equivalent patch set for arm64</a> in the
works.
<p>
<h4>51 Patches and counting</h4>
<p>
As of this writing, the x86 patch series is at <a
href="/Articles/741883/">version 163</a>.  It contains 51 patches, so we
can all be grateful that most of the intervening versions were not posted
publicly.  The initial patch set, posted by Dave Hansen, has been
extensively reworked by Thomas Gleixner, Peter Zijlstra, Andy Lutomirski,
and Hugh Dickins, with suggestions from many others.  Any bugs that remain
in this work won't be there as the result of a lack of experienced eyeballs
on the code.
<p>
Page tables on contemporary systems are organized in a tree-like structure
that makes for efficient storage of a sparse memory map and supports the
huge pages feature; see <a href="/Articles/117749/">this 2005 article</a>
for more details and a diagram of how it works.  On a system with four
levels of page tables (most largish systems, these days), the top level is
the page global directory (PGD).  Below that come the page upper directory
(PUD), page middle directory (PMD), and page-table entries (PTE).  Systems
with five-level page tables insert a level (called the P4D) just below the
PGD.
<p>
Page-fault resolution normally traverses this entire tree to find the PTE of
interest, but huge pages can be represented by special entries at the
higher levels.  For example, a 2MB chunk of memory could be represented by
either a single huge-page entry at the PMD level or a full page of
single-page PTE entries.
<p>
In current kernels, each process has a single PGD; one of the first steps
taken in the KPTI patch series is to create a second PGD.  The original
remains in use when the kernel is running; it maps the full address space.
The second is made active (at the end of the patch series) when the process is
running in user space.  It points to the same directory hierarchy for pages
belonging to the process itself, but the portion describing kernel space
(which sits at the high end of the virtual address space) is mostly absent.
<p>
Page-table entries contain permission bits describing how the memory they
describe can be accessed; these bits are, naturally, set to prevent user
space from accessing kernel pages, even though those pages are mapped into
the address space.  Unfortunately, a number of hardware-level bugs allow a
user-space attacker to determine whether a given kernel-space address is
mapped or not, regardless of whether any page mapped at that address is
accessible.  That information can be used to defeat kernel address-space
layout randomization, making life much easier for a local attacker.
The core idea behind KPTI is that switching to a PGD
lacking a kernel-space mapping will defeat attacks based on these
vulnerabilities, of which we have apparently not yet seen the last.
<p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<p>
The idea is simple but, as is so often the case, there are a number of
troublesome details that turn a simple idea into a 51-part patch series.
The first of those is that, if the processor responds to a hardware
interrupt while running in user mode, the kernel code needed to deal with
the interrupt will no longer exist in the address space.  So there must be
enough kernel code mapped in user mode to switch back to the kernel PGD and
make the rest available.  A similar situation exists for traps,
non-maskable interrupts, and system calls.  This code is small and can be
isolated from the rest, but there are a number of tricky details involved
in handling that switch safely and efficiently.
<p>
Another complication comes in the form of the x86 local descriptor table
(LDT), which can be used to change how the user-space memory layout looks.
It can be tweaked with the little-known <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/modify_ldt.2.html"><tt>modify_ldt()</tt></a>
system call.  The early POSIX threads implementation on Linux used the LDT
to create a thread-local storage area, for example.  On current Linux
systems, the LDT is almost unused but some applications (Wine, for example)
still need it.  When it is used, the LDT must be available to both kernel
and user space, but it must live in kernel space.  The KPTI patch set
shuffles kernel memory around to reserve an entire entry at the PGD level
for the LDT; the space available for <tt>vmalloc()</tt> calls shrinks to a
mere 12,800TB as a result.  That allows space for a large number of LDTs,
needed on systems with many CPUs.  One result of this change is that the
location of the LDT is fixed and known to user space — a potential problem,
since the ability to overwrite the LDT is easily exploited to compromise
the system as a whole.  The final patch in the series maps the LDT
read-only in an attempt to head off any such attacks.
<p>
Another potential vulnerability comes about if the kernel can ever be
manipulated into returning to user space without switching back to the
sanitized PGD.  Since the kernel-space PGD also maps user-space memory,
such an omission could go unnoticed for some time.  The response here is to
map the user-space portion of the virtual address space as non-executable in the
kernel PGD.  Should user space ever start running with the wrong page
tables, it will immediately crash as a result.
<p>
Finally, while all existing x86 processors are seemingly affected by
information-disclosure vulnerabilities, future processors may not be.
KPTI comes with a measurable run-time cost, estimated at about&nbsp;5%.
That is a cost that some users may not want to pay, especially once they
get newer processors that lack these problems.  There will be a
<tt>nopti</tt> command-line option to disable this mechanism at boot time.
The patch series also adds a new "feature" flag
(<tt>X86_BUG_CPU_INSECURE</tt>) to indicate vulnerable CPUs; it is set on
all x86 CPUs currently, but might not be on future hardware.  In the
absence of this feature flag, page-table isolation will automatically be
turned off.
<p>
Approximately one month remains before the opening of the 4.16 merge
window.  During that time, the KPTI patch set will undoubtedly go through a
number of additional revisions as the inevitable glitches come to light.  Once
things settle down, though, it would appear that this code will be merged
and backported to stable kernels in a relative hurry.  Apparently, we can
look forward to slower — but more secure — kernels as a new-year's present.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; That allows space for a large number of LDTs, needed on systems with many CPUs</font><br>
<p>
Not quite.  The reserved space is per-process and contains at most two LDTs.  I reserved all that space because the pagetable management for that space is more like user memory than kernel memory, and mixing the two styles in the same PGD entry could lead to nasty synchronization issues.<br>
<p>
The reason that there are two LDTs per process is to keep atomic LDT switches simple.  The old and new LDTs are both mapped and then all affected CPUs are notified of the change.<br>

The comments in the linked KAISER article mentioned that SPARC and s390 already use separate address spaces for user and kernel. Do those have some hw feature that allows them to do it with less overhead (if so, what?) , or is it just a convention?<br>
<p>
And what about risc-v? Have they managed to avoid this or are they also vulnerable? I see that the privileged isa is still in draft status, so maybe they can still fix it? <br>

      <p>SPARC and S390 support "Address Space Identifiers" (ASIs). In this world, the hardware extends the address supplied to the MMU with an ASI to tell the MMU what sort of access is being made - and the only way to set your ASI is to be in privileged code.
<p>In SPARC v8, for example, there are privileged instructions to use an arbitrary 8-bit ASI; user mode instruction fetch is ASI 0x08, supervisor mode instruction fetch is ASI 0x09, user mode normal data access is ASI 0x0A, and supervisor mode normal data access is ASI 0x0B.  The MMU sees the combination of virtual address and ASI, and does translation accordingly; the normal setup to get a KAISER-like situation is to have ASIs 0x08 and 0x0A only able to access user mode memory (kernel memory is simply not mapped in ASIs 0x08 and 0x0A), while ASIs 0x09 and 0x0B can see kernel memory, too.
<p>In more complex setups, user memory is not mapped for the supervisor ASIs, and you use the advanced instructions to override ASI when you're doing to <tt>copy_(to|from)_user</tt> functions, so that an erroneous access to user memory just fails.

Replying to myself, seems they haven't. Here's a proposal by Christoph Hellwig to fix it: <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/d/msg/isa-dev/JU0M_vug4R0/YELX92fIBwAJ">https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/d/msg/isa-de...</a><br>

So forgive the ignorance of a newcomer, but the %5 appears to come from the need to flush TLBs to cross page sets. Intel (as well as AMD) have had advanced virtualization support for a while now (mainly aimed at multiple VM architectures) that allow the TLB to hold "address space identifiers" so that the TLB can, in fact, hold different working sets at the same time, even though only one is active. The idea of that feature was that different VMs could cross from one to the other without the typical TLB flush penalty. However, that feature seems ideal for anytime that two disjoint working sets need to be in use with rapid switching between them. This sounds taylor made for KPTI?<br>
<p>
The need to hold disjoint working sets for kernel and user is not a new thing. 360/VM did this, and most virtual paged processors outside of the 80x86 series would simply swap the register that holds the root page table on traps, so that you could implement any level of isolation you wanted (by mapping some, most or all of the pages jointly between page sets).<br>

For systems/loads that suffer excessively from PTI there is the nopti option that can be used in a trusted environment.  Would it make any sense and be practical to support turning it off for a specific process and its children, perhaps with an interface similar to sudo?<br>

      Per-process (or perhaps per-thread, maybe) granularity for PTI is in the works and will show up eventually.  I'll write an update early next week that will include this work.

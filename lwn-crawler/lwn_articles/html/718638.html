           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 2, 2017</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2017/">LSFMM 2017</a>

<p>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt></a>
system call tries to do too many things, Miklos Szeredi said at the start
of a filesystem-only discussion at LSFMM 2017.  He has been interested in
cleaning that up for a long time.  So he wanted to discuss some ideas he
had for a new interface to mount filesystems.
</p>

<p>
<tt>mount()</tt> is lots of operations all rolled up into one call; there
are various fields that are used in different ways depending on what needs
to be done and it is almost out of flags to be used.  It supports
regular mounts, bind mounts, remounting, moving a mount, and changing the
propagation type for a mount, but they are mutually exclusive and some
operations 
require a remount.  For example, you cannot create a read-only bind mount;
you must first do the bind mount, then remount it read-only.  Similarly,
you cannot change the propagation parameters while doing a bind mount or
changing other mount flags.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi has come up with a proposed solution with several new system calls,
starting with:
<pre>
    int fsopen(const char *fstype, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
It would be used to get a file descriptor to communicate with a filesystem
driver and might be called as follows:
<pre>
    fsfd = fsopen("ext4", 0);
</pre>
That would provide a connection to the ext4 filesystem driver so that
parameters could be set via a protocol.
</p>

align="right" alt="[Miklos Szeredi]"
title="Miklos Szeredi" width=227 height=260>
</a>

<p>
The talk of a protocol prompted Jeff Layton to ask about using a netlink
socket instead.  But Al Viro said that a netlink protocol would need to be
fully specified right from the start, which would not fit well.  Josef
Bacik said that he thought netlink would allow adding new attributes and
values after the fact.  There could a different protocol specification for
each filesystem type, perhaps based on a common set for all filesystems
with extensions for specific types.  Layton agreed but said the mechanism
for the protocol could be determined at a later point.
</p>

<p>
The protocol Szeredi is envisioning would have a set of configuration
commands, each with a NUL-delimited set of parameters.  It might look
something like:
<pre>
    SETDEV\0/dev/sda1
    SETOPTS\0seclabel\0data=ordered
    ...
</pre>
That data would be written to the filesystem file descriptor returned from
<tt>fsopen()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
Jeff Mahoney asked if there was a need for a system call at all.  Perhaps
sysfs or the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem could be used instead.  One attendee
pointed out that would mean that some other mechanism would need to be used
to mount <tt>/proc</tt> or <tt>/sys</tt>. There might also be implications
for booting, since those filesystems may not be available early enough to
mount the boot partition.
</p>

<p>
Additional system calls would be needed, Szeredi said, moving back to his
proposed interface.  Attaching a filesystem to a mount point would be done
with <tt>mountat()</tt>, changes to a mount would done using
<tt>mountupdate()</tt>, while <tt>mountmove()</tt> to move a mount and
<tt>mountclone()</tt> to clone one round out the set.  There were
suggestions that some of those could be combined into one call,
<tt>mountmove()</tt> and <tt>mountclone()</tt> in particular.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi said that he would look into using a netlink socket rather than
<tt>fsopen()</tt>.  One attendee said that netlink would make the simple
case of a straightforward mount more complicated, but Szeredi said that the
existing <tt>mount()</tt> would not be going away.

<p>
David Howells wondered
if netlink was an optional kernel component; if so, mounting using this new
mechanism would be impossible in some cases, another attendee said.  But,
again, Szeredi said that the existing <tt>mount()</tt> system call could be
used. 
There was some concern that filesystems will come to depend on these new
interfaces, so that using <tt>mount()</tt> won't work well.  
</p>

<p>
Layton noted that there have been requests for better error messages from
mounting operations; often there is not enough detail in the error code
returned.  Szeredi said that more detailed information could potentially be
read from the descriptor returned by <tt>fsopen()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
Overall, the attendees seemed interested in having a better API for
mounting filesystems, but it would seem there is a ways to go before
there is something concrete to ponder.

<p>
Both md and dm already have mechanisms for "build some kernel object using these storage devices".  While I don't claim either of them represent perfection, but it would seem sensible to use existing practice as the starting point for a discussion, rather than creating something totally different.<br>

When you want to be able to handle all POSIX-compatible file names, e.g. for loop mounting, you pretty much have to use \0 terminators or come up with escape characters. Given this alternative, I think \0 terminators are preferable, especially for C.<br>

If you want to stay with pure text then you can do length-tagged pairs, something like:<br>
<p>
12\n<br>

23\n<br>
/a/23/character/file/name\n<br>

      <strike>Shouldn't we stop reinventing the wheel and go directly for XML? (trolling)</strike><br>
<br>
You mentioned that having '\0' have some downsides, but you did not specify which ones exactly. On the other hand I see a (in my optinion) significant downside of your encoding. With known lengths of the values it is very easy to calculate the required buffer size with zero terminated strings. In your case calculating the buffer size in advance is complicated.<br>
<br>
You can appeal that we don't care about the performance of the mount system call. I would say that later the same format can be used in other places too. Making a format difficult to generate and to parse should not be based on the fact it will be rarely used.<br>

XML is way too complex (namespaces, entities, ...) but JSON (or one of its binary counterparts like BSON) would indeed be a welcome addition.<br>

Several languages make it difficult to work with \0-containing strings, like good old bash or C.<br>

<p>
I think the point is that with \0-terminated strings, you can precalculate the buffer size by summing strlen() of the parts. With a prefixed string, you have to add ceil(log10(strlen()))  + 1 or something like that to account for the length.<br>
The simplest workaround in plain old C is to use snprintf(NULL, 0, format, …) and use the return value to allocate the actual buffer.<br>

msgpack is probably the most consistent and performant binary encoded equivalent of JSON.  It would certainly be a great thing to start using a standardized data interchange format rather that using a hand rolled format for anything that isn't performance critical (i.e., called 1000+ per second).  However, I wouldn't hold my breath, the kernel community is still holding on to C90.<br>

Considering a path is allowed to contain newlines using a NUL byte does make sense. If I remember correctly the only illegal characters in a path are NUL and the path separator ("/" generally).<br>

Indeed, that sounds lovely!<br>
<p>
However, it seems like you'd effectively be implementing a second version of mount namespaces, which while possibly elegant doesn't actually sound like a great idea.  :(<br>
<p>
If I were to redesign linux (which I won't be doing for many good reasons) I'd be highly tempted to remove all the non-"at" system calls, and move the whole concept of the root directory and working directory into user space (as two file descriptors).  Things would be simpler and more elegant, and we wouldn't need special system calls like `chdir` or `pivot_root`.  But that's only a daydream...<br>

<p>
Agreed completely for working directory.  File-descriptor inheritance seems quite appropriate for that.<br>
<p>
For the root directory, that would raise some security implications.  Any setuid/setgid/privilege-raising application would need a secure way of running/loading out of its own root, so it can't get fooled by being run within a custom root.  Otherwise, you could trivially use that to become root by running a setuid program with a root that contained your own dynamic libraries.<br>
<p>
As long as we're talking about fundamental redesigns, I'd also eliminate all "raise privilege when run" mechanisms, and instead require handling that in userspace.  Make a user/group privilege something you can have 0 or more of, with the privilege token for root giving you the ability to mint more such tokens.  And then handle sudo/su/etc by running a server in userspace that can spawn more privileged processes on behalf of less privileged processes given appropriate controls.<br>

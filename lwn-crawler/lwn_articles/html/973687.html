<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 16, 2024</br>
           </div>
The merge window for the 6.10 kernel release opened on May&nbsp;12; between
then and the time of this writing, 6,819 non-merge commits were pulled into
the mainline kernel for that release.  Your editor has taken some time out
from <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a> in an attempt to keep
up with the commit flood.  Read on for an overview of the most significant
changes that were pulled in the early part of the 6.10 merge window.
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for a number of early Alpha CPUs (EV5 and earlier) has been
     removed.  As noted in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/736676f5c3ab">the merge
     message</a>, these were the only machines supported by the kernel that
     did not provide byte-level memory access, and that created
     complications for support throughout the kernel.  It is also the first
     non-x86 architecture to which the kernel was ported. Linus Torvalds
     amended the merge message to add:
     <p>
     <blockquote class="bq">
	I dearly loved alpha back in the days, but the lack of byte and word
	  operations was a horrible mistake and made everything worse -
  	  including very much the crazy IO contortions that resulted from it.
<p>
	  It certainly wasn't the only mistake in the architecture, but
  	  it's the first-order issue.
<p>
  	  So while it's a bit sad to see the support for my first alpha go
	  away, if you want to run museum hardware, maybe you should use
	  museum kernels.
     </blockquote>
<li> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32</a>
     subarchitecture now supports shadow stacks.
<li> Arm64 systems have gained support for the <a
     href="/Articles/940704/"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt> write-protect
     feature</a>.
<li> There is now a BPF just-in-time compiler for 32-bit ARCv2 processors.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Rust abstractions for time handling within the kernel have been
     added.  This work was <a href="/Articles/924746/">discussed</a> in
     early 2023 and has finally found its way in; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/48b7f4d29ac8">this commit</a> for
     the current form of this interface.
<li> BPF programs now have the ability to use wait queues in the kernel;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6e10b6350a67">this merge
     message</a> for some more information.  It is also now <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/55d30cc90fd4">possible</a> for BPF
     programs to disable and enable preemption.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>F_DUPFD_QUERY</tt> operation for <tt><a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl()</a></tt>
     allows a process to check whether two file descriptors refer to the
     same underlying file.  This functionality is also provided by
     <a href="/Articles/845448/"><tt>kcmp()</tt></a>, but in a more
     restricted form that leaks less information from the kernel and, as a
     result, should be available even on systems where
     <tt>kcmp()</tt> is disabled.
<li> The block-throttling low-limit mechanism, <a
     href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9/source/block/Kconfig#L122">described</a>
     in the <tt>Kconfig</tt> file as "<q>a best
     effort limit to prioritize cgroups</q>", has been removed.  It was
     marked as "experimental" since being introduced in 2017, does not
     appear to have acquired users, and complicated the maintenance of the
     block layer.
<li> The EROFS filesystem now supports Zstandard compression.
<li> The <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-crypt.html">dm-crypt</a>
     device-mapper target has a new <tt>high_priority</tt> 
     option that allows it to use high-priority workqueues for its
     processing.  This option can improve performance on larger systems,
     but defaults to "off" to avoid creating latency problems for other
     workloads (such as audio processing) on smaller systems.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     pin controllers using the SCMI message protocol and
     Intel Granite Rapids-D vGPIO controllers.
<li> <b>Graphics</b>:
     Samsung S6E3FA7 panels,
     ARM Mali CSF-based GPUs,
     LG SW43408 panels,
     Raydium RM69380-based DSI panels, and
     Microchip LVDS serializers.
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     Analog Devices ADP1050 power-supply controllers,
     Lenovo ThinkStation EC sensors, and
     Infineon XDP710 hot-swap controllers.
<li> <b>Input</b>:
     WinWing Orion2 throttles.
     <p>
     <b>Also:</b> the <a href="/Articles/909109/">BPF for HID drivers
     framework</a>2 is finally seeing some use with the addition of a number of
     small fixup programs to the kernel tree, <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/04b3e5ab0555">the first of
     which</a> is for the XPPen Artist 24 device.  Some <a
     href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/udev-hid-bpf">new udev
     functionality</a> is used to load these programs as needed.

<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     STMicroelectronics STM32 firewall-framework controllers,
     Arm Trusted Services secure partitions,
     NXP DCP key-storage devices,
     NVIDIA Tegra security engines, and
     Airoha SPI NAND flash interfaces.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     Airoha EN8811H 2.5 Gigabit PHYs,
     Realtek 8922AE PCI wireless network (Wi-Fi 7) adapters,
     Realtek 8723CS SDIO wireless network adapters,
     TI Gigabit PRU SR1.0 Ethernet adapters,
     Microsemi PD692x0 I2C power sourcing equipment controllers,
     TI TPS23881 I2C power sourcing equipment controllers,
     Renesas RZ/N1 Ethernet controllers, and
     Intel HCI PCIe Bluetooth controllers.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     Rockchip RK3308 audio codecs and
     Texas Instruments PCM6240 family audio chips.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The version of the Rust language used with kernel code has been moved
     up to 1.78.0.  Among other things, this change has made it possible to
     drop the kernel's forked version of the <tt>alloc</tt> crate, removing
     about 10,000 lines of code.  A number of other changes have been made
     as well; see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8f5b5f78113e">this
     merge message</a> and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/56f64b370612">this commit</a> for
     the full list.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The performance of zero-copy send operations using io_uring has been
     significantly improved.  It is also now possible to "bundle" multiple
     buffers for send and receive operations, again improving performance.
<li> The sending of file descriptors over Unix-domain sockets with
     <tt>SCM_RIGHTS</tt> messages has long been prone to the creation of
     reference-count cycles; see <a href="/Articles/779472/">this 2019
     article</a> for one description of the problem and attempts to resolve
     it.  The associated garbage-collection code has been massively
     reworked for 6.10, leading to a simpler and more robust solution; see
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/da493dbb1f2a">this merge
     message</a> for some more information.
<li> There is now basic support for setting up <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFCP">packet forwarding control
     protocol (PFCP)</a> filters, though much of the work must be done in
     user space and only IPv4 is supported.
<li> TCP sockets now support the <tt>SO_PEEK_OFF</tt> socket option in the
     same way that Unix-domain sockets do.  This allows the specification
     of an offset to be used when looking at data with <tt>MSG_PEEK</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The kernel now supports encrypted interactions with trusted platform
     module (TPM) devices; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3d2daf9d592e">this documentation
     commit</a> has more information.
<li> The "crypto usage statistics" feature, which is seemingly unused,
     has been removed from the kernel.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/29ce50e078b8">this commit</a> for a
     detailed justification for this removal.
<li> BPF programs now have access to the kernel's crypto framework.
</ul>

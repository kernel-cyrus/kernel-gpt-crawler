<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2010/">2010 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
For the last few years, Rafael Wysocki has been the main tracker of
regressions in the Linux kernel.  Avoiding regressions is important: if the
kernel is allowed to regress, there can never be any assurance that things
are getting better over time.  So it's not surprising that, as with
previous years, regressions were a topic at the 2010 Kernel Summit and that
the developers in attendance were interested.
<p>
Rafael started by pointing out that regression tracking is no longer a
one-person show.  Entries in the kernel bugzilla are now usually created by
Maciej Rutecki, while the maintenance of bug reports is done by Florian
Mickler.  Andrew Morton does the work of noticing new bug reports in the
first place, and Rafael generates and posts the lists of regressions.  All
told, the system seems to work well with less stress on any single person.
<p>
A number of tables full of numbers were posted; your editor could not
possibly have copied them all down.  The good news is that we hope to run
an article on regressions written by Rafael himself in the very near
future; that article should more than fill in any gaps in the data.
Meanwhile, here are the regression numbers for the last year or so of
kernel releases:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=2>
<tr><th rowspan=2 valign="middle">Kernel</th>
    <th colspan=2>Regressions</th></tr>
<tr><th>Reported</th><th>Unfixed</th></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.31</td><td align="right">146</td><td align="right">20</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.32</td><td align="right">133</td><td align="right">28</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.33</td><td align="right">116</td><td align="right">18</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.34</td><td align="right">119</td><td align="right">15</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.35</td><td align="right">63</td><td align="right">28</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
It may look like the situation began to improve around 2.6.33, but there's
an important thing to note: the way regressions are recorded was changed at
that time.  Prior to 2.6.33, regressions were added to the list as soon
after they were reported; starting in 2.6.33, they will only be added if
they remain unfixed for at least one week.  Rafael says there was little
point in recording regressions which vanish almost immediately.  Once this
change is taken into account, he said, the regression numbers have not
actually changed much over this time.
<p>
He put up another table showing when regressions were reported.  Through
2.6.32, the number of unfixed regressions in 2.6.n was higher when 2.6.n+1
was released than when 2.6.n came out.  After that time, the situation
reversed; the number of unfixed  regressions in a given kernel release will
be lower when the subsequent release comes out.  So, it seems, we are
getting a little better about fixing things.
<p>
How much better is not clear, though.  According to Rafael, the mean
lifetime of a reported regression is "approximately 24.5 days."  That
number has not really changed over the last two years.
<p>
Where are the regressions being found?  The direct rendering subsystem is
by far the biggest offender, with the Intel-specific DRI code, on its own,
being at the top of the list.  After that are the x86 architecture, the
filesystem code, and the network subsystem.  This information led to the
fairly obvious conclusion that regressions tend to be found in code which
(1)&nbsp;is actually used, and (2)&nbsp;is under relatively heavy
development.  Rafael also noted that code which deals closely with hardware
tends to be more prone to regressions than core kernel code.
<p>
What about regressions in the stable tree?  Those should not happen at all,
but they do anyway.  One reason for that is that code in stable releases
tends to get very good test coverage after the release.  But regressions
also happen because there is real value in aggressively pushing fixes into
the stable tree.  Rafael suggested that the stable tree needs a rule to the
effect that any patch causing a regression will be instantly reverted; Greg
Kroah-Hartman responded that there is already such a rule.  It seems,
though, that Greg isn't always being informed when stable-tree regressions
are reported.
<p>
Steve Rostedt asked how many fixes for regressions actually cause
regressions of their own.  Thomas Gleixner retorted that such things only
happen in the tracing code.  Rafael, more seriously, noted that it does
happen, but he doesn't track those occurrences.
<p>
Rafael took some time to complain about the state of the kernel bugzilla
system which, it seems, is essentially unmaintained at the moment.
Sometimes it just doesn't work, it doesn't track information he would like
to have, an account is required for anybody who would like to be on the Cc
list, etc.  So it seems that there is an opening available for somebody who
would like to volunteer to improve the kernel bugzilla; volunteers were
notably absent from the room, though.

How many of these unfixed regressions remain unfixed?  How many are fixed in point releases?  How many are fixed in the next release? <br>
<p>
Are we building a massive pool of regressions that if not fixed before release, never get fixed?<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

Usually all regressions are fixed eventually. <br>
<p>
Look at the dependency tree of bug 15790 to make yourself a picture. The amount of open regressions is somewhat related to the amount of time people spend on going through the old reports and researching if the bug is fixed or not. <br>

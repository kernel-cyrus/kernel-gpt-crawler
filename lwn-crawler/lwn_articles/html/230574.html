<h1>Schedulers: the plot thickens</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224865/">RSDL scheduler</a> (since
renamed the staircase deadline scheduler) by Con Kolivas was, for a period
of time, assumed to be positioned for merging into the mainline, perhaps as
soon as 2.6.22.  Difficulties with certain workloads made the future of
this scheduler a little less certain.  Now Con would appear to have
rediscovered one of the most reliable ways of getting a new idea into the
kernel: post some code then wait for Ingo Molnar to rework the whole thing
in a two-day hacking binge.  So, while Con has recently <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/230500/">updated the SD scheduler patch</a>,
his work now looks like it might be upstaged by Ingo's new <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/230501/">completely fair scheduler</a> (CFS),
at <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/230752/">version 2</a> as of this writing.
<p>

There are a number of interesting aspects to CFS.  To begin with, it does
away with the arrays of run queues altogether.  Instead, the CFS works with
a single <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a> to
track all processes which are in a runnable state.  The process which pops
up at the leftmost node of the tree is the one which is most entitled to
run at any given time.  So the key to understanding this scheduler is to
get a sense for how it calculates the key value used to insert a process
into the tree.
<p>

That calculation is reasonably simple.  When a task goes into the run
queue, the current time is noted.  As the process waits for the CPU, the
scheduler tracks the amount of processor time it would have been entitled
to; this entitlement is simply the wait time divided by the number of
running processes (with a correction for different priority values).  For
all practical purposes, the key is the amount of CPU time due to the
process, with higher-priority processes getting a bit of a boost.  The
short-term priority of a process will thus vary depending on whether it is
getting its fair share of the processor or not.
<p>

It is only a slight oversimplification to say that the above discussion
covers the entirety of the CFS scheduler.  There is no tracking of sleep
time, no attempt to identify interactive processes, etc.  In a sense, the
CFS scheduler even does away with the concept of time slices; it's all a
matter of whether a given process is getting the share of the CPU it is
entitled to given the number of processes which are trying to run.  The
CFS scheduler offers a single tunable: a "granularity" value which
describes how quickly the scheduler will switch processes in order to
maintain fairness.  A low granularity gives more frequent switching; this
setting translates to lower latency for interactive responses but can lower
throughput slightly.  Server systems may run better with a higher
granularity value.
<p>

Ingo claims that the CFS scheduler provides solid, fair interactive
response in almost all situations.  There's a whole set of nasty programs
in circulation which can be used to destroy interactivity under the current
scheduler; none of them, says Ingo, will impact interactivity under CFS.
<p>

The CFS posting came with another feature which surprised almost everybody
who has been watching this area of kernel development: a modular scheduler
framework.  Ingo describes it as "an extensible hierarchy of scheduler
modules," but, if so, it's a hierarchy with no branches.  It's a simple
linked list of modules in priority order; the first scheduler module which
can come up with a runnable task gets to decide who goes next.  Currently
two modules are provided: the CFS scheduler described above and a
simplified version of the real-time scheduler.  The real-time scheduler
appears first in the list, so any real-time tasks will run ahead of normal
processes.

<p>

There is a relatively small set of methods implemented by each scheduler
module, starting with the queueing functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*enqueue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    void (*dequeue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    void (*requeue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
</pre>
<p>
When a task enters the runnable state, the core scheduler will hand it to
the appropriate scheduler module with <tt>enqueue_task()</tt>; a task which
is no longer runnable is taken out with <tt>dequeue_task()</tt>.  The
<tt>requeue_task()</tt> function puts the process behind all others at the
same priority; it is used to implement <tt>sched_yield()</tt>.
<p>

A few functions exist for helping the scheduler track processes:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*task_new) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    void (*task_init) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    void (*task_tick) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
</pre>
<p>
The core scheduler will call <tt>task_new()</tt> 
when processes are created.
<tt>task_init()</tt> initializes any needed priority calculations and such;
it can be called when a process is reniced, for example.  The
<tt>task_tick()</tt> function is called from the timer tick to update
accounting and possibly switch to a different process.
<p>
The core scheduler can ask a scheduler module whether the currently
executing process should be preempted now:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*check_preempt_curr) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
</pre>
<p>
In the CFS scheduler, this check tests the given process's priority against
that of the currently running process, followed by the fairness test.  When
the fairness test is done, the scheduling granularity is taken into
account, possibly allowing a process to run a little longer than strict
fairness would allow.
<p>
When it's time for the core scheduler to choose a process to run, it will use
these methods:
<p>
<pre>
    struct task_struct * (*pick_next_task) (struct rq *rq);
    void (*put_prev_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
</pre>
<p>
The call to <tt>pick_next_task()</tt> asks a scheduler module to decide
which process (among those in the class managed by that module) should be
running currently.  When a task is switched out of the CPU, the module will
be informed with a call to <tt>put_prev_task()</tt>.

<p>
Finally, there's a pair of methods intended to help with load balancing
across CPUs:
<p>
<pre>
    struct task_struct * (*load_balance_start) (struct rq *rq);
    struct task_struct * (*load_balance_next) (struct rq *rq);
</pre>
<p>
These functions implement a simple iterator which the scheduler can used to
work through all processes currently managed by the scheduling module.
<p>
One assumes that this framework could be used to implement different
scheduling regimes in the future.  It might need some filling out; there
is, for example, 
no way to prioritize scheduling modules (or choose the default
module) other than changing the source.  Beyond that, if anybody ever wants
to implement 
modules which schedule tasks at the same general priority level, the strict
priority ordering of the current framework will have to change - and that
could be an interesting task.  But it's a start.
<p>
The reason that this development is so surprising is that nobody had really
been talking about modular schedulers.  And the reason for that silence is
that pluggable scheduling frameworks had been soundly rejected in the past
- <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/109460/">by Ingo Molnar</a>, among
others:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So i consider scheduler plugins as the STREAMS equivalent of
	scheduling and i am not very positive about it. Just like STREAMS,
	i consider 'scheduler plugins' as the easy but deceptive and wrong
	way out of current problems, which will create much worse problems
	than the ones it tries to solve.
</div>
<p>
So the obvious question was: what has changed?  Ingo has posted <a
href="/Articles/230628/">an explanation</a> which goes on at some length.
In essence, the previous pluggable scheduler patches were focused on
replacing the entire scheduler rather than smaller pieces of it; they did
not help to make the scheduler simpler.
<p>

So now there are three scheduler replacement proposals on the table: SD by
Con Kolivas, CFS by Ingo Molnar, and "nicksched" by Nick Piggin (a
longstanding project which clearly deserves treatment on this page as
well).  For the moment, Con appears to have decided to take his marbles and
go home, removing SD from consideration.  Still, there are a few options
out there, and one big chance (for now) to replace the core CPU scheduler.
While Ingo's work has been generally well received, not even Ingo is likely
to get a free pass on a decision like this; expect there to be some serious
discussion before an actual replacement of the scheduler is made.  Among
other things, that suggests that a new scheduler for 2.6.22 is probably not
in the cards.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I can certainly understand Con.<br>
<p>
But, on the other hand, runqueue handling is an issue that, so far, every scheduler has shown problem with, one time or another. The radical idea of doing away with them altogether certainly deserves a closer look.<br>

I'm interested how the single-RB-tree idea will handle on a machine with a lot of CPUs. Off to check gmane.lists.linux.kernel ...<br>

      Gah. Forgive my sloppy use of language. By "single RB tree" I meant "a single tree to replace the former run queues structure", not "a single tree on the whole system". Process migration between CPUs is, after all, not going to go away.<br>
<p>
On another front, despite Con being rather miffed by Ingo's original patch, the subsequent dialog between them is a model of mutual respect that lots of people can learn from. Myself included.<br>

<p>I'm surprised by the combination of no one doing this before and someone doing it now. 
Before reading the recent article about the scheduler, I'd only seen priority queues implemented 
as an array of plain queues in cases where there were only a handful of priorities. When there's 
one per nice level (140?) or many more (priority is a function of nice level and timeslice left), it 
seems like trees or heaps would be an obvious choice. Having a sorted structure seems much 
simpler than doing these minor and major rotations to the array, with this secondary "expired" 
array.

<p>So given that they originally did this a different way, the logical question is why. Was it so 
the time complexity could be O(p) [*] rather than O(log n)? Well, now Ingo's apparently thinking 
that's not important. How many processes was the O(1) scheduler designed to support? How long 
does Ingo's scheduler take to run in that situation?

<p>If O(log n) does turn out to be a problem, I wonder if a mostly-sorted <a rel="nofollow" href="http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_heap">soft heap</a> would be better at amortized O(1). Faster as a 
whole, and "corrupting" a fixed percentage of priorities might not be a bad way to avoid total 
starvation of low-priority processes, but amortized time might mean it'd be too jerky to be used.

<p>[*] - p = number of priorities...from skimming the description, it doesn't look like it was 
ever O(1) like the cool kids said. They just considered p to be a constant 140.

      Another important property of Ingo's scheduler is that the time is measured in nanoseconds. According to a later email, Ingo said that the earlier version without the high precision and using queues didn't work well at all. This are the two things that seem to have been limiting RSDL and other schedulers, as strange artefacts cropped up because of the queue and low granularity design.<br>
<p>
Peter William (of plugsched) also wrote a scheduler, and experience with trying out different things.<br>
<p>
William Lee Irwin III (now I understand why people call him wli ;-) is hammering on the importance of a standard test suite for schedulers, so if there are people with free time who want to help him with setting one up...<br>

      there isn't really a standard testsuite, but many of the problem cases (and the little code snippets to show 'em) are sticking around, and are used for testing new scheduler improvements/changes. Quite a few float around on the LKML and also on Dr Con's mailinglist.<br>

      The "modularity" in Ingo's queue interface would seem to lend itself toward implementing something similar to the traffic control packet scheduler framework.  IIRC, OpenVZ uses a TBF-based hierarchical fair scheduler; it would be interesting to see it ported to CFS.<br>

           </div>
Stable kernel update announcements posted on LWN have a certain tendency to be
followed by complaints about the amount of information which is made
available.  It seems that there is a desire for a description of the
changes which is more accessible than the patches themselves, and for
attention to be drawn to the security-relevant fixes.  
As an exercise in determining what kind of effort is being asked
of the kernel maintainers, your editor decided to make a pass
through the <a href="/Articles/375435/">proposed 2.6.32.9</a> update and
attempt to describe the impact of
each of the changes - all 93 of them.  The results can be found below.
<p>

Disclaimers: there is no way to review 93 patches in a finite time and
fully understand each of them.  So there are <strike>probably</strike>
certainly errors in what follows.  The simple truth of the matter is that
it is very hard to say which fixes have security implications; a determined
attacker can find a way to exploit some very obscure bugs.
<p>
Your editor would also like to discourage anybody from thinking
that this will become a regular LWN feature.  The amount of work required
is considerable; it's not something we're able to commit to doing for every
release. 
<p>
That said, here's a look at what's in this update.
<p>
<h4>Security-related fixes</h4>
<p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="/Articles/375337/">#2: futex_lock_pi() key refcnt fix</a>.
     It's possible to create dangling futex references, leading to a
     user-triggerable <tt>BUG_ON()</tt> oops.  It's thus a denial of
     service vulnerability; it has been present since 2.6.28.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375338/">#3: futex: Handle user space corruption
     gracefully</a>.  Malicious programs can cause a null pointer
     dereference or hijack somebody else's futex.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375418/">#4: futex: Handle futex value corruption
     gracefully</a>.  User-space processes can cause warning floods,
     spamming the system logs.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375339/">#5: Fix race in tty_fasync() properly</a>.
     Possible (if unlikely) deadlock, and thus denial of service.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375415/">#22: regulator: Fix display of null
     constraints for regulators</a>.  Fixes an information disclosure issue
     in the regulator code.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375417/">#23: ALSA: hda-intel: Avoid divide by zero
     crash</a>.  Papers over a user-triggerable divide-by-zero crash; the
     real cause of the problem remains unknown.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375412/">#26: cciss: Make cciss_seq_show handle
     holes in the h->drv[] array</a>.  Null pointer dereference in the
     cciss driver; probably not triggerable without privilege.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375400/">#35: NFS: Fix an Oops when truncating a
     file</a>.  User-triggerable oops when truncating a file on an NFS
     filesystem. 
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375401/">#36: NFS: Fix a umount race</a>.  Dangling
     pointer dereference on NFS filesystem unmount.  <I>Maybe</i> triggerable in
     situations where users can cause mounts and unmounts to happen.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375341/">#40: V4L/DVB: dvb-core: fix initialization
     of feeds list in demux filter</a>.  User-triggerable dereference of a
     corrupted pointer, with an oops being the best-case scenario.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375390/">#47: netfilter: nf_conntrack: per netns
     nf_conntrack_cachep</a>.  Fixes a potential leak of information
     between network namespaces.  Probably very hard to exploit in any
     useful way.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375395/">#50: netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix hash
     resizing with namespaces</a>.  Changing the conntrack hash size in one
     namespace causes that size to be incorrect for all others, leading to
     unsightly kernel oops issues.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375387/">#54: [S390] dasd: remove strings from
     s390dbf</a>.  Stale pointer dereference bugs in the S390 DASD driver. 
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375381/">#57: dell-wmi, hp-wmi, msi-wmi: check
     wmi_get_event_data() return value</a>.  Fix a potential null pointer
     dereference on memory allocation failure.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375375/">#75: ALSA: usb-audio - Avoid Oops after
     disconnect</a>.  Fixes a user-triggerable oops in the USB audio
     driver. 
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375370/">#79: USB: usbfs: only copy the actual data
     received</a>.  Usbfs was copying more data than actually existed in
     some situations, leading to a potential information disclosure problem.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375366/">#82: ACPI: Add NULL pointer check in
     acpi_bus_start</a>.  A null pointer dereference in the ACPI code.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/375357/">#92: dm log: userspace fix overhead_size
     calculations</a>.  A couple of structure-size miscalculations make both
     buffer overruns and information disclosure possible, though it's not
     at all clear that either is readily exploitable.

</ul>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>
Out of 93 patches, 18 struck your editor as having clear security
implications.  Quite a few other patches fix crashes which could possibly
be security problems; if they are not listed as such, it's because there
was no immediately evident way that a user could trigger the problem.
Doubtless people with more imagination will figure out ways to take
advantage of some of these bugs.
<p>
What it comes down to is that the identification of security problems is
often hard.  In the kernel environment, almost any bug could potentially
create some kind of vulnerability.  So it is not surprising to see developers
"silently fix" security bugs; they simply fix bugs without realizing the
implications.  It is also not surprising that some developers are reluctant
to call attention to security-related fixes.  The list above almost
certainly includes "security fixes" for bugs that nobody can exploit while
classifying true vulnerabilities as mere bug fixes.  Any list of
security-relevant patches is sure to be an incomplete and partially
deceptive thing.
<p>
That said, it may well be that fixes which are truly known to have security
implications should be marked as such.  Attackers will make the effort to
figure that out anyway; it's not clear that making life harder for
everybody else has any benefits.  Still, those who would complain about how
the stable tree is managed would do well to remember that, a few years ago,
we had no such tree.  It came into being because people stepped up to do
the work of maintaining it.  There can be no doubt that a better job could
be done here (as is the case almost everywhere else too); its just a matter
of somebody finding the time and the energy to do it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm curious why you marked '#1 Fix potential crash with sys_move_pages.' as <br>
non-security. I am not aware of any path to privilege escalation from this <br>
bug, but it's definitely a denial of service, and an impressively effective <br>
information leak attack (as demonstrated by spender's published exploit <br>

      Because I blew it, apparently.  I couldn't see any sort of reliable way to trigger it, so it just looked like a crash.  Obviously, I was unaware of the exploit or the CVE number.  Clearly, it's a security problem.

This is correct. I would add that given enough time, a determined hacker, and a convenient definition of security, any bug has the potential of having security consequences. Thus, I have to agree with Linus that time spent in assessing if a certain bug is or is not security related is time wasted. Just fix it and move on, or better yet prevent it from happening.<br>

If you are knowingly aware it is a security issue your fix may solve the bug but <br>
not the security issue and/or cause another security exploit. Just fixing bugs <br>

      That, of course, would require that developers truly understand the impact of their fixes.  Maybe someday we'll all be sufficiently aware to write lines like:
<p>
<pre>
    Impact: Stop turning machines into botnet fodder
</pre>
<p>
Most of us, though, just think "it fixed another bug."

In the present context, we only really need "impact" for something that is going in to -stable.  When it goes into -stable it is a new commit and so the commit message can be adjusted then.<br>
When a patch is being submitted the -stable, the submitter presumably can justify the request for the patch to go into stable.  If that justification were written is clear succinct text (the hard part!) and placed in an 'Impact:' line, then these release notes would be already written.<br>

How on earth would our gracious editor (or anybody else for that matter) make <em>sure</em> the fix has *no* security implications?
<p>
Besides, this being the patches vetted for inclusion in -stable, it stands to reason that most (all?) are potentially <em>very</em> serious (that is not the same as "all-around security relevant")

      By being conservative. It would always be safe to <i>leave off</i> the mark, if it marks non-security critical patches. Whereas currently many patches which are probably <i>are</i> security critical don't get marked.
A non-security-critical mark could probably only be applied to feature additions.

How is "leave off the not-sensitive mark" different from what goes on today? Just to be on the safe side, as a developer/integrator I'd leave it off always... and as a consumer I'd presume all patches in -stable are potentially security sensitive, just like today.

this seems to be a clear proof that almost any kernel bug is a security issue.... <br>
<p>
Now that we have this long list of clearly identified security issues.... are we going to see really big security updates for the distros that don't keep up with the latest kernels? (esp. the enterprise kernels)<br>
or are users of those kernels just going to keep the security issues....<br>

Yes. What I've always found missing from the stable work is a reference to the commit that introduced the bug/error condition, i.e. a tag like<br>
<p>
Bug-since: &lt;commit&gt;<br>
<p>
This should be possible to determine for the majority of patches I'd guess and it would be machine checkable for backporters.<br>

      <p>I occasionally wonder whether the "Bug-since:" pointer shouldn't just be the parent pointer....

<p>That is to say, when applying a simple bugfix, first check out the commit that introduced the bug and commit there--at least in cases where the merge into recent upstream would be easy.

As someone who has whined mildly in the past about the amount of information posted in these "the next Linux version is out" posts, let me be among the first to thank you for the tremendous amount of work you put into this! Wow!<br>
<p>
That said, I guess I should make clear that this is *way* more than I was asking for.  I would be perfectly happy to have the line "the usual security and bug fixes" which would cover 90% of this list.  What I'm hoping would be possible is to additionally try to capture some information about a couple of specific changes that a lot of folks on LWN might care about (for example, I found the ALSA divide-by-zero fix really interesting as an example of "kludge it for now") and summarize what systems were most impacted by the changes (in this release, it looks like NFS and i915 were well-represented).<br>
<p>
Maybe this is still too much work to do on every release.  But honestly, an article that just tells me to go do a git pull without other information is little better than noise; if that's the best that can be done I personally would be happy to just skip these announcements altogether.<br>
<p>
Again, though, my thanks!  That was a really interesting exercise, and I really appreciate it.<br>

Very interesting experiment, thanks for doing this!<br>
<p>
One thing I noticed that would take little effort and help improve clarity for the bugs marked as security-relevant would be to provide some context to included oops/BUG in the commit messages.  If it's for a resident device like a soundcard, did the oops occur prior to init, or was it triggered at runtime by a user?<br>
<p>
Seeing oops messages consistent with a particular exploitable bugclass always sets off alarms, but in many instances the bugs just aren't reachable by an attacker.  A few extra words of context could help.<br>
<p>
Some of the ones you missed (the move_pages() one for example that I wrote an exploit for) would have been caught if the information known by the committer (Linus in this case) had made it into the commit message.  That particular bug was reported by SuSE security and its impact was known.  It was even reported to SuSE as having security impact.  It's a good example of how deliberate obfuscation hurts the wrong people.  In this case, you didn't spot it as being security relevant, while I wrote an exploit for it.<br>

I'm sorry, but I've to side with the developers here.
<p>
Just imagine you (as developer) get a bunch of (mostly incomplete, often conflicting) problem reports, and you are at the end able to track down what seems to be the cause. You fix it, and go your merry way chasing the next bug. Or you then sit down trying to organize the whole mess to create an intelligible commit message/impact assesment. Better skip the second part, as it slows down the fixing of bugs. Besides, your assesment could very well be dead wrong (see the oversights in the article for examples), or it might even be that while researching one problem you find (and fix) a completely unrelated issue. Is the poor developer then forced to search all over the reports to check if it fixes something else? This being open source, if somebody wants accurate bug impact assesments, they are more than welcome to contribute the required expertise and manpower to compile and publish them. That this hasn't shown up (only whining that it is not out for grabs) indicates that the need really isn't there...
<p>
Bugs are bugs, they need to be fixed. Sure, we <em>know</em> by now that anything that could lead to following a bogus pointer (including NULL), or writing past allocated space, or sloppy locking, among others can lead to security problems, and such patches get priority going to stable. Other stuff can be handled with a more cavalier attitude, as long as it isn't shown that it causes (security) trouble.
<p>
I just fail to see what could be gained by labeling some bugs as security-sensitive while others aren't. The labeling won't ever be correct, so your best bet is to apply all patches. If that isn't enough for your level of paranoia, you won't trust the labels anyway, and (re)do the checking. This is quite beside the fact that what would be a mild or nonexistent problem for one configuration might be lethal in another one.

You should give your opinions some context, so that others can know if they should listen to anything you have to say.<br>
<p>
1) What distro do you use?<br>
2) How many servers do you maintain?<br>
3) How many (estimated) users are there on those servers total?<br>
4) What kind of services are provided by the systems?<br>
5) How often do you upgrade your kernels?<br>
6) How many desktops do you maintain?<br>
7) What kernel are you currently running?<br>

It's obvious you don't do anything in security, and your arguments are nothing but arguing with scenarios you imagined up to suit your own apologist view.<br>

      <I>You fix it, and go your merry way chasing the next bug. Or you then sit down trying to organize the whole mess to create an intelligible commit message/impact assesment. Better skip the second part, as it slows down the fixing of bugs.</I>
<P>
No, the job of the software developer is not only to fix bugs, but create useful commit messages, because somebody else might look at the same code a couple of years later and would like to know why that change was introduced.

<p>
There is a fundamental difference between a commit message that accurately describes what was fixed (which is not dependent on any other context than the code that was touched), and an assessment of the impact of that fix in what could be a huge range of contexts, most of which have little or nothing to do with the actual implementation.
<p>
Not knowing how and when to distinguish between these two is what makes these <strike>flamefests</strike> discussions such a waste of spacetime.

      Jonathan, thanks for writing this article. I'm glad I'm not the only one 
doing these now ;) You might want to subscribe to http://seclists.org/oss-
sec/ where we keep track of both kernel (and non-kernel) security issues in 
upstream open source projects. Of course, that includes the regular stable 
kernel updates too.

-Eugene

      There isn't one yet. It requires some effort but it shouldn't be difficult 
to do this. Just monitor the oss-security mailing list, and the two other 
links that PaXTeam posted in his reply.

Nobody ever suggested that kernel developers should do any such thing. What was suggested was that when kernel developers _already_ know that something has security implications they should tell the rest of us. And no, this does _not_ mean that other fixes are not security related, just that kernel developers don't know whether they are or not.<br>

Let them have their straw men.  People like clugstj who keep bringing up and attacking things that no one on the "complaining" side has said are people that haven't listened to a single word for the past 2 years.  I'm curious what form of Linux these anti-complainers are using -- since they act as if this issue doesn't affect Linux users at all.<br>
<p>
I'd also like to say something about the last paragraph of the article.  "Those who would complain about how the stable tree is managed" "do well to remember" a few years ago when Chris Wright was involved in the stable releases as well.  The official policy was different back then, and it's gone downhill since he stopped being involved.  As for insinuating that the complainers (which would include me) haven't stepped up to offer time/energy, I'd like to point out that in July 2008 around the time when this issue was first heavily debated, the PaX Team and myself offered our free time to do similar cursory write-ups on the stable releases.  Jake had presented the idea to us and said it would be hosted on LWN.  Nothing had ended on a sour note, but the last email we received about it was the day after the first email we received about it.  We didn't hear anything else back until we asked about it ourselves again in January of 2009.  Apparently in the meantime Jake thought "it might not be very productive" and failed to inform us that he scrapped the idea.<br>
<p>
Like Eugene mentioned, some of us are putting forth the effort to bring some honesty to the security of the kernel.  If you look at Linus' ridiculous changelog message for move_pages(), at the lengths he went through to take the accurate, useful information he was given and turn it into something pointlessly obfuscated (when the two line fix screams of fixing completely nonexistent bounds checks), you'll understand why the work of the "complainers" is important.  It's surprising, actually, given Linus' hatred for embargoes -- he wants users to have the security bugs fixed and not have to wait an arbitrary amount of time for it.  How does he expect these fixes to get back to actual users if he actively works to hide them?<br>
<p>
Seriously, look at it:<br>

I can imagine fixes for buffer overflows being worded like:<br>
"We incorrectly depended on strcpy for testing the array size, rather than checking it explicitly.  That's not reliable, even if it might often happen to work.  So do the proper explicit test."<br>

"the PaX Team and myself offered our free time to do similar cursory write-ups on the stable releases"<br>

It's not clear from this whether you merely offered (it's easy to offer) or whether you actually did it. If you did, links please? It might be interesting to see whether your attempts were any better than our esteemed editor.<br>

i can't speak for spender here but i keep my own logs on various commits here for stuff that i find relevant for myself (not necessarily security related either). but that's a private list and not what we were going to publish.<br>

it seems you're just trolling as usual. but if you want to get a taste of what was going to be published, read spender's twitter stream where he pointed out several silently fixed security bugs over the past months, many if not all of them without a CVE at the time. reminds me, did the sparc64 NX bug get a CVE already?<br>

I'm sorry, but you claim to be doing the work of travelling the patches and checking them for security relevance, and <em>do not</em> publish the results, while complaining others don't publish the very same data (which they arguably don't have at hand)?

i don't understand what is there to publish. aren't all bugs just bugs? what else do *you* want to know about them? you can't defend the coverup of security bugs and complain about their lack of disclosure at the same time. make up your mind ;). also you're welcome to follow spender's twitter stream, we often inform each other about suspicious commits and investigate together.<br>
<p>

i never complained about not disclosing security impact information they do not themselves have already. quote me back if you believe otherwise. what i did and still do complain about is when they *know* that a commit fixes a security bug but cover it up.<br>

I fail to see any problem with the changelog entry. A range test was mistakenly omited, add it. Sure, this particular missing range check can have disastrous consecuences, just as there are probably a dozen others added the same way that are "can't happen"s or have little or no impact.
The log entry describes <em>what</em> was wrong with the code, as it should.

It's not a straw man.  I'm too lazy to look it up, but nearly every time that there is a security problem in a kernel update, someone belly aches that the kernel developers should figure out for if this bug is a security problem for them.<br>

It's very hard work to do this even in the general case.  I'd much rather the kernel developers spend their time FIXING bugs than trying to imagine the possible uses a black hat could have for it.<br>

Pardon me if I don't believe your "search" - it could be a bit biased.  Why would I apologize to you?  Did I mention you or the others going bonkers in this thread by name at any point in this discussion?<br>
<p>
If you told a kernel developer that such and such a bug has this security impact, why should he automatically believe you?  Unless he very much trusts your opinion or has the time to check your findings, he would be foolish to do so.<br>
<p>
I made the original comment for two reasons:<br>

1) I have seen the kind of comment of which I speak.  I never said it was from you, nor did I have you in mind.<br>

Please stop this nonsense. If Linus (or whoever) knows about the possible security implications of, let's say, 10 or 20% of the bugs, and only marked those, the majority of security sensitive bug patches would just be ignored by would-be "experts", and the whining about the other "not reported" bugs would start whenever some box gets broken into...
<p>
A bug in the kernel is potentially <em>extremely serious</em>, go and fix it. Questions are optional, patching isn't.

stop that nonsense. you have zero evidence for it. in the previous thread a kernel developer only offered anecdotal evidence which is of course as good as mine or anyone else's. you might want to understand who patch users are too: <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/374094/">http://lwn.net/Articles/374094/</a> . also you might want to explain why file system corruption bugs are marked as such in commit messages whereas there's no guarantee that unmarked commits don't fix file system corrupting bugs.<br>

Filesystem corruption bugs are marked as such *if people realise at fix <br>

Not all filesystem-corrupting bugs are recognised as such at fix time, <br>
just like not all security bugs are recognised as such. (It is probably <br>
easier to detect a filesystem-corrupting bug than a security bug, because <br>
at least there are broad regions of the kernel where bugs are unlikely to <br>

aha. and "if people realise at fix time that they are security bugs" they... don't mark them as such. not only that, they even try to explain why that's a good thing. now you tell me why the same arguments don't apply to filesystem corruption bugs (and many others, i just picked an obvious one for this exercise). or more to the point, why the arguments for marking known filesystem corruption bugs don't apply to known security bugs. btw, i'm glad that after years of misunderstanding you're slowly getting it ;).<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; [...]because at least there are broad regions of the kernel where bugs</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; are unlikely to affect filesystems,</font><br>
<p>
anything that can result in kernel memory corruption, in those broad regions of the kernel included, has a fair chance to trash filesystem related (meta)data as well. speaking of which, by the same token if said memory corruption bugs are not marked for security, they should at least be marked for potential filesystem corruption but not even that is done.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; btw, nice to see you're vilely rude to everyone, not just me</font><br>

i wasn't rude to you, you yourself admitted that you sometimes post under the influence of drugs that you later regret. i was merely wondering if the same happened here as well because you so obviously posted crap about something that wasn't ever said (you're welcome to prove your post with quotes from us).<br>

it is as none of us made such a claim you're trying to push here, in fact every time this comes up we make a claim to the contrary: kernel devs are not expected to figure out the security impact of bugs because they're not qualified to do so. just look at Jon's effort here and how he missed #1 and mischaracterized #2.<br>

you're welcome to find a *single* post from us that makes a claim you wish to attribute to us. after all, if it was 'nearly every time' you won't have to spend more than a few seconds to find one.<br>

(sorry for the late reply, I was travelling back from SCALE)<br>

At around the same time as we were discussing the idea, there was a flamewar about the same subject going on in lkml and it seemed clear to me that the personalities involved (on both sides) would likely just perpetuate that. That's why I didn't think it would be very productive, fwiw.<br>

But I certainly don't discourage information about the known security impacts of stable tree patches (or any other patches for that matter) being published.  If it were, we would be likely to link to it.<br>

And though I listed you as "pretentious", I would not put you in the same <br>
class as PaxTroll or spender, who go out of their way to be condescending <br>
primadonnas.  And corbet would likely label me as disrespectful in these <br>
comments (it's true; I do *not* respect the above two I mentioned).<br>
<p>
The LWN comment section is not well suited to these kinds of opinionated <br>
"discussions", since there are no tools to control the threading, collapsing <br>
and rating of comments, etc.  Hence, the same points keep getting <br>
fruitlessly reargued.  Not sure its fixable, but a simple filter *might* help <br>
with signal to noise for those that want to have a novel discussion.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, I'd rather talk about things like which of these fixes actually <br>
solve an issue for people.  We have been testing #36 for a short while, <br>
since the umount bug it fixes was actually hitting us in practice.  It'd be <br>
nice to talk about something like who here is actually using and testing the <br>
2.6.32.y series, and what issues have they had?<br>

2.6.32.x has actually been by far my least problematic kernel series in <br>
ages. 2.6.31 had e1000e flow control lossage for me, and a couple of <br>

single unreproducible incident of massive ext4 filesystem corruption (well <br>
I say 'massive' but fsck fixed it completely: it just took it half an hour <br>

all, other than an obscure and hard-to-track-down intel-hda ALSA bug, <br>
exhibited only by PulseAudio complaints.<br>

Maybe you like accepting a view given to you by Linus and other kernel developers as is. I find it confusing and illogical.<br>
<p>
First, they tell us that all bugs should be considered "normal bugs": <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure">http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclo...</a>.<br>
<p>
Then in 2.6.32.8 (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/373579/">http://lwn.net/Articles/373579/</a>), just a while ago, we are told that, yes, there are security bugs. But, we cannot know which ones they are, although kernel developers already know, because they took special steps to make sure they were properly backported and tested.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, we are STRONGLY encouraged to upgrade. Why strongly? Why not just normally? After all, security bugs are just normal bugs, right?<br>
<p>
Now, please, tell me what is pretentious about asking to square up the above? I do not see how both can be true. Either security bugs are special (given that kernel developers are obviously giving them special treatment) or they are not. Also, if they already know about them, why can't we be told?<br>

I think you got that backward. It's not that security bugs are normal <br>
bugs, therefore security bugs are as unimportant as normal bugs: it's that <br>
in an unprotected environment like the kernel, almost any bug could <br>
potentially be a security bug (although it might be hard to exploit if, <br>
say, it requires module unloading to trigger). i.e., normal bugs are <br>
potentially as important as security bugs -- but it is quite impractical <br>
to consider them *actually* as important as security bugs, because so very <br>
many bugs are fixed all the time. They're merely *potential* security <br>
bugs. And this is true of most bugs when they're fixed.<br>
<p>
I don't agree with Linus that bugs that are *known* to be security bugs at <br>
the time they're fixed shouldn't be called out as such and backported. I <br>
do agree that it's impractical to expect the security implications of all <br>
bugs to be spotted by the person who fixes them at the time the fix is <br>
made: even if it is obvious to a steeped-in-security guy like spender, it <br>
may not be obvious to everyone.<br>
<p>
I'd assume that everyone involved in kernel programming knows how bad <br>
buffer overruns and wild pointer dereferences are. After the recent <br>
palaver I'd hope they'd know that NULL pointer dereferences are bad too. <br>
But there are lots of other classes, and some are rare enough that I <br>
wouldn't know them if I saw them, and might not even know them if they <br>
were pointed out to me. (This is where spender's published exploits are <br>
especially useful to whitehats, IMNHSO: for didactic purposes. He puts <br>
comprehensible comments in the damn things! You can use any random <br>
blackhat's exploit to see if your machine is vulnerable, but if you want <br>
to know how that class of exploit works, and thus why the vulnerability is <br>
a vulnerability, you need more than a pile of incomprehensible uncommented <br>
shellcode.)<br>

Not my words, actually. Directly from Linus:<br>
<p>
"I personally consider security bugs to be just 'normal bugs'. I don't cover them up, but I also don't have any reason what-so-ever to think it's a good idea to track them and announce them as something special."<br>

<p>
And that is the crux of the issue here. What is being asked is actually quite simple. If the kernel developers know it's a security issue (by determining that themselves or by being told by someone experience in security), they should tell the rest of us. No extra effort required.<br>
<p>
All other bugs, of course, can still turn out to be security issues. Such is kernel life, I guess. I'd say everyone is aware of that by now.<br>

Yeah.... I, for one, totally don't expect them to spend a bunch of extra work figuring out if something is a security problem.  But I DO expect them to pass along if it's a confirmed security issue if they already know about it.  Deliberately obfuscating that information only hurts me.  It can't possibly help. The ONLY thing it "helps" is that people get less pissed about security holes.  <br>
<p>
Having the same number of actual bugs, but being less aware of security holes, is actively dangerous.  I consider it egregious behavior to deliberately mislead people about the nature of security fixes.<br>

What is impossible to satisfy is illogical explanations about why things that were known to be security problems never got disclosed as such. The latest obfuscation by Linus is a clear case in point. The announcement of the .8 release is another.<br>

If something as implemented is nonsense, expect questions. Waving a magic wand in the hope that these questions will vanish won't work. Neither will same illogical explanations.<br>

i think it would be difficult to link to individual twitter messages about each problem as it was noted (and i don't know that twitter gives enough room for context and such), but some kind of summary in a web forum or page, mailing list posting, or whatever would (obviously) be of interest to our readers.<br>

Nobody's asking for anything of the sort; what we want is very simple.  If a bug is actively known to be a security issue, pass that information along instead of actively trying to obfuscate it. <br>

It almost makes me wish for a microkernel... but, of course, all *that* <br>
would do would be to convert a limited set of arbitrary code execution <br>
holes into DoS attacks, introduce a pile of additional complexity that <br>
would have holes of its own, and add a good bit of performance bashing.<br>
<p>
What we really need is a better language. The surface for most of these <br>
holes (null pointer dereference, integer and buffer overflow holes, at <br>
least) could be reduced to that tiny subset of the kernel implemented in <br>
assembler. Wire something like the pi calculus into the language and even <br>
races would be automatically detectable. (Obviously we can't eliminate all <br>
DoS attacks, ever, even with formally proven perfect hardware and an ideal <br>
language. That class of holes will always be with us.)<br>
<p>
But for better or worse Linux is written in C, dammit, so these holes will <br>
keep on coming. Until we find a way to avoid all mistakes I don't see a <br>
way to stop them, though sparse and friends can at least slow them down, a <br>
bit. Blaming people for introducing holes when writing in a language like <br>
this is like blaming people for tripping when walking backwards, <br>
blindfolded, over rocky ground, in a blizzard, during an earthquake.<br>

We have the notable advantage that the kernel is written in a stereotyped <br>
subset of C (as is true of any program that's not written by a frothing <br>
madman). So the tools can use that, and (as sparse and GCC do) can rely on <br>
user annotations, as well as erring on the side of paranoia.<br>

So, yes, I was being excessively depressing.<br>

I know quite a bit about process calculus, although my choice of poison is CSP. The concurrency workbench is CCS, if I remember correctly. FDR, which may be available to developers in academia, handles CSP. Do you know of anything similar for pi-calculus?<br>
<p>
You could, of course, follow my PhD thesis and prove a general result about a class of systems and limit yourself to that class of system. You can even write frameworks which make it almost impossible to do anything else. (I could say more but wont.)<br>
<p>
Unfortunately whatever you do there is the problem of arguing that the kernel code corresponds to the process calculus or has the things your general proof required.<br>
<p>
99.98% of the time concurrency just adds locking and context switches and therefore reduces system performance. The best approach the other 0.02% of the time is a more difficult question. <br>

Exactly. Without an automated prover the thing is mostly useless for 
actually reducing bug count: and when was the last time you encountered an 
automated prover for any but the most toy of languages that actually 
<i>was</i> automated? They tend to need so much assistance that they 
become far more a burden than a help, unless you're doing something 
hyper-life-critical.

I was musing on the theoretical bound when I should have been thinking 
about reality...

Yea I find it fascinating too that the code you wrote that introduced the bug was also fixed by you with a commit message missing the original details about chmod from the bug reporter (available here: <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/1/20/168">http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/1/20/168</a>) and mentioning "Resulting in overly restrictive permissions on sysfs files" yet apparently with the knowledge that it was a security issue wasn't picked up by a non-security person as a security issue.<br>
<p>
Same goes for all those sysctl vulnerabilities you claimed before that weren't fixed by anything but your sysctl rewrite.  I mean, those vulnerabilities should be utterly obvious to any backporter!<br>
<p>
I'm simply shocked.<br>

Thx for the detailed report Jon. :)<br>
<p>
I personally appreciate what Spender/PaXteam do as well, and don't give a damn that their style may not be to everyone's taste. Who cares? "You left a wheel off the 747, it's going to crash!" "Oh! How can you be so rude?" Ridiculous.<br>
<p>
That said, it would be fantastic if they could share their extensive knowledge more widely. What is preventing you guys from following up on LKMLish lists with info you appear to already have in hand? Perhaps if you called "BS" there for a number of months to individual commits a larger audience would see what was going on and things might change.<br>

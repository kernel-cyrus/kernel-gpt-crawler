coverage</a> on LWN.net.

Andrew Morton ran a session to talk about kernel regressions and the
development process in general.  As has been documented elsewhere, Andrew
feels that the quality of kernel releases is in decline and that more
attention needs to be paid to tracking down and fixing bugs.  He was not
entirely successful in convincing the other developers of this, however.
<p>
The talk began with the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/190678/">survey of
LWN readers</a> on kernel quality.  Andrew called out a few details from
the responses, including the fact that some 70% of respondents have
encountered bugs in 2.6 kernels, but only 13% went on to say that the
quality of the kernel is getting worse.  Nearly half of the people who
responded to the question feel that new features are emphasized too much
over stability and bug fixing.  Many respondents feel that problems
reported to mailing lists do not get enough attention, and the majority of
them feel that way about bugs reported via the kernel bugzilla.
<p>
The first thing to do was to try to decide whether the results from the LWN
survey actually meant anything.  Surveys can be subject to no end of
problems; is the LWN survey sane?  After some discussion, the consensus was
that perhaps the numbers make sense, but only after applying some filters.
It was suspected that people who have had problems with 2.6 kernels were
more likely to respond than those who are simply happy, so the overall
level of problems reported is likely to be too high.  In the experience of
most kernel developers, many of the things reported as bugs are, in fact,
simply unsupported hardware.  Others are in fact hardware difficulties
unique to a single system and unfixable in the kernel.
<p>
Linus noted that, given the likely existence of selection bias, the results
were relatively encouraging.  Even people who have filled out a survey
based on a bad experience tend, for the most part, to not feel too bad
about the process as a whole.  He was interested in the low vote of
confidence in the kernel bugzilla, however.  Ingo Molnar noted that fixing
problems out of bugzilla is a low-visibility process - it feels like work,
and is relatively unappealing.  A lot of developers also just don't pay
attention to it.  One change which might come out of the discussion is
automatically forwarding bugzilla reports (initial reports only) to the
appropriate subsystem-specific mailing lists.
<p>
James Bottomley, the SCSI maintainer, reported that the frequency of SCSI
bug reports has remained about the same over the last few years.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman said that USB bugs were, if anything, dropping off a bit.
Len Brown said that the number of ACPI bug reports remained about the same,
even though the number of ACPI users is growing significantly; from that,
he concludes that the code is getting better.
<p>
The bottom line is that the kernel developers feel that there is no
systemic quality problem in the development process, and that major changes
are not needed.
<p>

There are always improvements to be made, of course.  Triaging and tracking
bugs is a big job which takes too much of Andrew's time, and getting
developers to fix bugs remains a problem.  Much of the bug tracking work is
an (approximately half time) job which could be shoved off onto somebody
else, especially if said somebody else were to occupy the cubicle next to
Andrew's.  He is working on making that happen; it will be interesting to
see how he brings this change about.  There are a number of
techniques which can be used to increase attention to bugs, such as public
flaming, blocking the inclusion of other patches, etc.  But Andrew
described such measures as "childish," and not something which should be
necessary in a community of professionals.  He would, however, like to see
fewer "it's not my problem" responses.  Many bugs are hard to track down,
and not all subsystems have active maintainers; developers should look
beyond their own specific areas when helping to fix bugs.
<p>

The -mm tree was discussed for a while.  This tree is seen as perhaps
breaking too often, a result of "dubious" patches being merged by Andrew
and by subsystem maintainers.  Andrew pledged to do better, and requested
that the other developers do the same.  There was discussion of creating a
separate tree dedicated to patches intended for the next mainline merge
cycle, but that idea was shot down.  It was thought that such a tree would serve mainly to
distract attention from both -mm and the mainline -rc releases.
<p>

It was noted that developers are not spending enough time reviewing others'
code.  Beyond that, reviewers should take a more active role in helping
developers to make their code ready for inclusion.  The example raised here
was the reiser4 filesystem, which has languished in -mm for two years.
There's plenty of blame to hand out to the reiser4 developers, but they
remain people who have put in a great deal of work trying to create
interesting new functionality for the Linux kernel.  We should be helping
them to finish that job and get their code merged.
<p>

Andrew asked: who is the i386 maintainer?  According to the kernel
maintainers file, it's Linus, but he's clearly not doing that at this
point. Linus said that he sees i386 as being a legacy architecture in five
years, and that ongoing maintenance could be a problem.  His suggestion was
to merge it into x86-64 as a sort of special case - making Andi Kleen its
maintainer in the process.  Andi showed a striking lack of enthusiasm for
this idea.
<p>

The problem of code entering the mainline without review by way of
subsystem git trees was pondered for a bit.  This practice was blamed for,
among other things, the much-lamented merging of the wireless extensions
netlink interface, which, at the summit, has received a fair amount of
rather belated criticism.  Linus suggested that each git tree maintainer
should, as a stable kernel release approaches, post a textual description
of the patches queued to be merged when the next kernel cycle starts.
Others could then read those descriptions and have a good idea of what is
coming; they could also choose to further investigate anything which looks
questionable.  It seems like a good idea which may not actually be
implemented as often as one might like.
<p>

A related problem is that of half-baked kernel patches being shoved into
the mainline kernel because the only alternative is to miss the merge
window and wait a few months.  One possible outcome here might be a policy
that all patches must be in the -mm tree before a kernel cycle begins to be
considered for merging that time around.

      I've never really liked the Bugzillas. Too much "database" and too little "conversation".<br>
<p>
If you go to a mailing list with your problem and attract attention, you may get intelligent questions asked back that not only gets more information but elevates your own understanding of the problem (which may not be that great which is why you came for help in the first place).<br>
<p>
Contrast that with a Bugzilla where when you report something you get "dont' understand, can't reproduce, wontfix". Sure, nothing stops you from having an intelligent discussion on a Bugzilla, but nobody really does. It's not designed for that.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying the tool is useless, it's great to track bugs, but there's tremendous room for improvement.<br>

If you're serious about this, please come talk to the Bugzilla devs on IRC or via the mailing list (details are on <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">http://www.bugzilla.org/</a>). Better yes, file bugs in  bugzilla.mozilla.org against the Bugzilla product.<br>

<p>
This is not my experience.  If I look at my bugs in the kernel bugzilla, there are two outstanding bugs at the time of writing - 6716 and 6815.<br>
<p>
6716 is presumed to be solved in 2.6.18-rc2, but asking the submitter to check this resulted in no response.<br>
<p>
6815 currently defies logical explaination and the submitter also seems to have one to ground.<br>
<p>
You claim that it depends on developers - I disagree.  My experience has been that it depends more on users responding to developers, rather than dumping a bug in and running away.  The submitter of a bug needs to takes on a certain responsibility to assist the resolution of the bug.  Without that, developers are left out in the cold and have no option but to throw away potentially valid bug reports.<br>
<p>
Because of that, I dislike bugzilla intensely.  The tool itself is fine, but the effect it has (that I've perceived so far) is far from desirable.<br>

      I used trac as a forum for conversation (at my workplace).  I used to use the Debian bug tracking system (by e-mail).  I've never successfully had a conversation on bugzilla.  Possibly a coincidence, or possibly a flaw in the design of bugzilla.<br>

      Is that what the majority of people feel ? To me it seems inefficient to <br>
adopt x86-64 for embedded projects, and I doubt that even in five years <br>
many embedded projects will need more than 4 gigs of RAM. <br>

      embedded projects are likly to continue useing x86 for a while, but embedded only use is legacy compared to desktop/server use with all the new drivers continually appearing :-)<br>
<p>
that being said, one of the huge benifits of x86 embedded is the common development environment, if the desktop environment moves to amd64 don't be surprised to see cut-down versions of amd64 chips (same instruction sets, but much simpler, cheaper, and slower) released, targeted specificly at the embedded market.<br>

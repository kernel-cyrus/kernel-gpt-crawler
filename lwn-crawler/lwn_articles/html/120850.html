<h1>A new core time subsystem</h1>

Keeping track of the current time is one of the kernel's many jobs.  In the
Linux kernel, this task is handled in a very architecture-dependent way.
Each architecture has its own sources of high-resolution time, and each
performs its own calculations.  This system works, but it results in quite
a bit of code being duplicated across architectures, and it can be
brittle.  Patches which change time-related code often do not manage to
correctly update all architectures.
<p>

John Stultz has been working for some months on a cleaner alternative.  The
result is <a href="/Articles/120588/">a new time subsystem</a> which, he
hopes, will improve the situation.
<p>

Much of the patch can be seen as a refactoring of the time code.  Common
calculations are now performed in the timeofday core, rather than in
architecture-specific code.  The code for implementing the network time
protocol (NTP), an interesting exercise in complexity itself, has been
separated from the rest of the time code and hidden in its own file.  Most
of the core time code has been reworked to deal with time in nanoseconds, a
format which gives adequate time resolution but which, in a 64-bit
variable, is still good for centuries.  The timeofday code no longer
depends on the <tt>jiffies</tt> variable, meaning that it can work
independently of the timer interrupt, which may be disabled in some
situations.  The overall result is kernel timing code which is much easier
to read and understand.

<p>

In the end, however, the timing code must go to the hardware to actually
get high-resolution time values.  John made a couple of observations here.
One is that, while time sources are architecture-dependent, many
architectures share the same types of timing hardware.  The other was that
the code which deals with a time source is really just another device
driver.  So he isolated the time source information into its own structure:
<p>
<pre>
	struct timesource_t {
		char* name;
		int priority;
		enum {
			TIMESOURCE_FUNCTION,
			TIMESOURCE_CYCLES,
			TIMESOURCE_MMIO_32,
			TIMESOURCE_MMIO_64
		} type;
		cycle_t (*read_fnct)(void);
		void __iomem* mmio_ptr;
		cycle_t mask;
		u32 mult;
		u32 shift;
		void (*update_callback)(void);
	};
</pre>
<p>

Here, <tt>name</tt> is just a name for the source, and <tt>priority</tt> is
used to choose between multiple available sources.  The <tt>type</tt> field
tells how this source can be read.  If <tt>type</tt> is
<tt>TIMESOURCE_FUNCTION</tt>, the <tt>read_fnct()</tt> will be called to
read the source.  The two <tt>_MMIO_</tt> variants are for hardware which
can be read directly from I/O memory; in that case, the time code can just
obtain a value from the location indicated by <tt>mmio_ptr</tt> with no
need to call any outside functions.  <tt>TIMESOURCE_CYCLES</tt> indicates
that the processor's time stamp counter (TSC) is being used, so
<tt>get_cycles()</tt> is called to get the actual value.
In any of the above cases, the value returned by the time source is assumed
to be some sort of counter.  The <tt>mask</tt>, <tt>mult</tt>, and
<tt>shift</tt> values are applied to turn a delta between two such values
into a number of nanoseconds for the rest of the timekeeping code.
<p>

With this structure in place, architecture-specific code need only fill in
a <tt>timesource_t</tt> structure (possibly implementing a read function in
the process) and pass it to <tt>register_timesource()</tt>.  All the rest
is then handled in the common code.  John has provided <a
href="/Articles/120590/">a set of time source drivers</a> for a few
architectures which demonstrates how they can be written.

<p>

The discussion of the patches suggests that, while developers like the
general intent, there are some remaining concerns - especially among the
architecture maintainers.  In some architectures, the
<tt>gettimeofday()</tt> system call can be handled entirely in user space,
but the current patches do not yet support that.  The current NTP
implementation is also seen as being too expensive.  Finding a way to cut
the cost of NTP while maintaining accuracy could be a bit of a challenge,
but John is working at it.  Expect to see some more iterations on this
one.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2011/">2011 Kernel Summit</a> coverage
</div>
James Bottomley somehow drew the short straw as the person who got to lead
a session on "coming to love control groups" at the 2011 Kernel Summit.  By
the end, it became clear that love for control groups was still somewhat
short of universal; indeed, not everybody fully understands how they work
or what the problems are.  They should, though; as James pointed out, use
of control groups is reaching a point where nobody can afford to ignore
them.  If you don't care today, he warned kernel developers, one day you'll
wake up and find them in your subsystem.
<p>
There are two aspects to control groups.  The groups themselves are just a
way of grouping processes; there may be complaints about how they are
implemented, but they are not hugely expensive or intrusive.  That cannot
always be said about the controllers which, when associated with control

<a href="/Articles/464313/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lc-europe/JamesBottomley-sm.jpg" width=125

groups, enforce resource limits and provide isolation.  Thomas Gleixner was
quick to chime in that one problem is that people are "creating control
groups like crazy"; he booted a box recently and found over 70 control
groups on it.  That, he thinks, is too many.
<p>
Lennart Poettering responded that systemd only uses control groups for
process grouping, it does not need any controllers at all.  The only one it
will use is the CPU controller if it is present.  It became clear during
the session - more than once - that he wanted to talk about systemd; that
made some sense 
since systemd is one of the biggest users of control groups, but the point
of the session was really to talk about control groups in the kernel.  The
discussion had to be rescued from systemd-related fights more than once
during this session.

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that one of the big problems is the interactions between
controllers.  Each controller is tied to a specific subsystem, but they
often operate in ways that affect each other.  It was asked whether it
would make sense to name a "control group maintainer" who would have an
overall view of the situation and try to make the controllers work better
together; Ingo Molnar suggested that a developer who has worked with
control groups for a while should be found to do it.
<p>
Andrew Morton seemed to think that a control group maintainer was a good
idea; he said that the real problem is getting people to pay attention to
all the new stuff out there.  Currently he is looking at the <a
href="/Articles/463357/">timer slack</a> and task counter controllers and
trying to figure out if they are something we want or not.  He is the
"resident sitting cgroup maintainer," but would really like some input from
others.  An "architect" who understands how the controllers interact would
be very helpful.  It would also be good to create a list for control group
discussions; containers@lists.linux-foundation.org has existed for a while,
but did not see a lot of use even before the Linux Foundation lists went
down.  James said he will create a new cgroups@vger.kernel.org list.
<p>
Ted complained about the lack of widely-used applications for controllers;
most of the code out there tends to be internal company code.  There was
agreement that having more useful utilities for control groups would be a
good thing.
<p>
With regard to the controllers themselves, Paul Turner said that Google
would, based on its experience, rip apart a lot of the controllers and
rework them in a better form.  Alan Cox added that a lot of the existing
controllers are "research projects" that should never have made it into the
kernel.  There were some emphatic suggestions that controllers should have
zero overhead if they are turned off, even when they are built into the
kernel.  It was also said that controllers should default to "off" unless
the user has explicitly asked for them to be turned on.
<p>
Another problem with controllers is their interaction with namespaces.  The
two often need to be used together, but their interfaces are completely
different and the combination is awkward.  Evidently there are patches in
the works to give namespaces a more cgroup-like interface.
<p>
Linus raised a complaint about namespaces: their implementation has
required changes throughout the kernel.  But there is still a lot of code
that has not been made namespace-aware; that code works most of the time,
but can occasionally break in random places.  A lot of kernel code still
looks at process IDs without taking into account the PID namespace; that
code could end up acting on the wrong process at times.  But people rarely
notice because much of this code is still unused.
<p>
The session ended with the identification of a potential control group
maintainer.  The <strike>victim</strike> future maintainer was not in the
room to defend himself, though, so his name will be withheld for the time
being.

"There are patches in the works to give namespaces a more control group like interface."    The concept sounds completely bogus and I haven't seen any of patch posted to make control groups more like namespaces.  The control group interface has serious nesting problems and as such can not be used for namespaces without removing functionality.<br>
<p>
I propose someone fix the control group interface so it works before having control groups take over the world.<br>

Presumably you mean the kernel-internal interface, not the userspace-visible interface? As far as I know directories can be nested with no problems at all. (If there are problems, a lot of people would like to know what they are!)

In a container context to be properly abstracted from what is outside the container you need fresh mounts for the controllers you are going to use and the ability to have a different binding of control groups to hierarchies.<br>
<p>
In fairness Paul Menage has been looking at this a bit after I raised the issue with him at plumers conf.<br>
<p>
James seems a little more dense and seems to not have understood when I pointed out that control groups and namespaces were not them same thing.  I guess more repetition of the obvious is in order.<br>

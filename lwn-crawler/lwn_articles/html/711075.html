The kernel faces a number of scalability challenges resulting from the
increasing data rates that can be handled by peripherals like
storage devices and network interfaces.  Often, the key to improved
throughput is doing work in batches; in many cases, the overhead of
performing a series of related operations is not much higher than for
performing a single operation.  Memory allocation is one place where
batching offers the potential for significant performance improvements, but
there has, so far, been no agreement on how that batching should be done.
A new patch set from Mel Gorman might just show how this problem can be
solved.
<p>
Network interfaces tend to require a lot of memory; all those incoming
packets have to be put somewhere, after all.  But the overhead of
allocating that memory is high, to the point that it can limit
the maximum throughput of the system as a whole.  In response, driver
developers are resorting to workarounds like allocating (then splitting up)
high-order pages, 
but high-order page allocation can stress the system as a whole and runs
counter to 
normal kernel development practice.  It would be good to have a better way.
<p>
At the 2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit,
networking developer Jesper Dangaard Brouer <a
href="/Articles/684616/">proposed</a> the creation of a new memory
allocator designed from the beginning for batch operations.  Drivers could
use it to allocate many pages in a single call, thus minimizing the
per-page overhead.  The memory-management developers at this session
understood the problem, but disagreed with the idea of creating a new
allocator.  Doing so, they said, would make the memory-management subsystem
less maintainable.  Additionally the new allocator would tend to repeat
the mistakes of the existing allocators and, by the time it had all the
necessary features, it might not be any faster.
<p>
The right solution, from the memory-management perspective, is to modify
the existing page allocator, reducing overheads and making it more friendly
to multi-page allocations.  This has not been done so far for a simple
reason: most memory users immediately zero every page they allocate, an
operation that is far more expensive than the allocation itself.  That
zeroing is not necessary for pages that will be overwritten with incoming
packet data by a network
interface, though, so high-performance networking workloads are more
seriously affected by the overhead in the allocator.  Fixing that overhead
in the existing page allocator
would solve the problem for the networking subsystem while avoiding the
addition of a new allocator and providing improved performance for all
parts of the kernel.
<p>
The idea made sense, but only had one shortcoming: nobody had actually done
the work to improve the existing page allocator in this way.  That
situation has changed, though, with the posting of Gorman's <a
href="/Articles/711046/">bulk page allocator</a> patch set.  The patches
are relatively small, but the claimed result is a significant improvement in
page-allocator performance.
<p>
Two fundamental changes are required to support both allocations; both take
the same form.  The first of these addresses the function
<tt>buffered_rmqueue()</tt>, which removes a page from a per-CPU free list
in preparation for handing it out in response to an allocation request.
Since the list is per-CPU, there is no locking required before making
changes, but it is necessary to disable interrupts on the relevant CPU to
prevent concurrent access from an interrupt handler.  Disabling and
restoring interrupts takes some significant time, and that time adds up if
it must be done repeatedly for each page being allocated.
<p>
Gorman's patch set splits up this function in a way that is common in
kernel programming.  A new function (<tt>__rmqueue_pcplist()</tt>) removes
a page from the list but does not concern itself with disabling interrupts;
that is expected to be handled by the caller.  A call to
<tt>rmqueue_pcplist()</tt> (without the leading underscores) will disable
interrupts and allocate the page in the usual way.  But now other code can
disable interrupts once, then call <tt>__rmqueue_pcplist()</tt> multiple
times to allocate a whole set of pages.
<p>
Similarly, <tt>__alloc_pages_nodemask()</tt> spends a fair amount of time
figuring out which zone of memory should be used to satisfy a given
request, then returns a page.  Here, too, those two operations can be split
apart, so that the zone calculation can be reused for multiple page
allocations rather than being performed anew for each page.
<p>
With these two changes in place, Gorman's patch set can add a new allocation
function:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long alloc_pages_bulk(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order,
				   unsigned long nr_pages, struct list_head *list);
</pre>
<p>
This function will attempt to allocate <tt>nr_pages</tt> pages in an
efficient manner, storing them in the given <tt>list</tt>.  The
<tt>order</tt> argument suggests that any size of allocation can be done in
bulk but, in the current patch, any <tt>order</tt> other than zero (single
pages) will result in a failure return.
<p>
The result of using this interface, he says, is a "<q>roughly 50-60%
reduction in the cost of allocating pages</q>".  That should help the
networking developers in their quest to improve packet throughput rates.
They will find that some assembly is required, though; Gorman went
as far as to show that the memory-allocator overhead can be reduced, but
stopped short of creating an API with all of the features that those
developers need.  His <a href="/Articles/711164/">plan</a> is to merge the
preparatory patches without the <tt>alloc_pages_bulk()</tt> API with the
idea that the actual bulk-allocation API should be designed by the
developers who need it.  
Thus, once these changes find their way into the mainline, it
will be up to the networking crew to do something useful with them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

To be fair, the really interesting work will be Jesper's. The bulk allocator is important because it reduces overhead and means Jesper's generic page pool allocator can reuse large portions of the existing page allocator. Minimally, this will reduce some motivation for drivers to use high-order pages. Caching coherent pages is now likely to be a relatively small wrapper around the bulk allocation API which will be easier to maintain. Once that exists and some drivers are converted, there should be some real value, particularly for high-speed networks. All of that is Jesper's work as I'm not well positioned to make the changes and validate the performance is improved and it's still functionally correct. I'll just be cheering from the side lines throwing in a few reviews.<br>

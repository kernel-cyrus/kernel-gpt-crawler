<p>
Displaying an application's graphical output onto the screen requires
compositing and 
mode setting that are correctly synchronized among the various pieces,
with low overhead.
In this second and final article in the series, we will look at
those pieces of the Linux graphics stack. In the  <a
href="/Articles/955376/">first installment</a>, we 
followed the path of graphics from the application, through Mesa, while
using the 
memory-management features of the kernel's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager">Direct
Rendering Manager</a> (DRM) subsystem.
We ended up with an application's graphics data stored in an output buffer,
so now
it's time to display the image to the user.
</p>

<h4>
Compositing
</h4>

<p>
User-space applications almost never display
their output by themselves, but instruct a screen compositor to do so.
The compositor is a system service that receives each application's
output buffers and draws them to an on-screen image. The layout is up to the
to the compositor's implementation, but
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling</a>
are the most common. The compositor is also responsible for gathering user
input and forwarding it to the application in focus.
</p>

<p>
Compositing, as well
as almost everything else in the graphics stack, used to be provided by
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window
System</a>, which implements 
a network protocol for displaying graphics on the screen. Since the
everything-else part includes drawing, mode setting, screen sharing, and
even
<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R6.8.2/doc/Xprint.7.html">printing</a>,
X suffers from software bloat and is hard to adapt to changes in the graphics
hardware and Linux system; a lightweight replacement was needed. Its modern
successor is 
<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>, which is
another client-server design where each application acts as a client
to the display service provided by the compositor. Wayland's reference
compositor is
<a href="https://wayland.pages.freedesktop.org/weston/">Weston</a>,
but GNOME's
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter">Mutter</a>
or KDE's
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin">KWin</a>
are more commonly used.
</p>

<p>
There's no drawing or printing in Wayland; the <a href="https://wayland-book.com/">protocol</a> only provides the
functionality required for compositing. A Wayland surface
represents an application window; it is the application's handle to display
its output and to receive input events from the compositor. Attached to the
surface 
is a Wayland buffer that contains the displayable pixel data plus
color-format and size information. The pixel data is in the output buffer that
the 
client application has rendered to. Changing a surface's attached buffer
object or its content results in a Wayland-protocol
surface-damage message from the application to the compositor, which updates the
on-screen content; possibly with the contents of a new buffer object. The
application's 
output buffer becomes an input buffer for the Wayland compositor.
</p>

<p>
Rendering in the compositor works exactly as described for applications in
the first installment.
The compositor maintains a list of all of the Wayland surfaces that
represent application 
windows. Those windows and the compositor's interface
elements form yet another <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graph</a>. The
background contains a wallpaper 
image, background pattern, or color. On top of the background, the compositor
draws the application windows. The easiest way to implement this is by
drawing a rectangle for each window and using the application-provided
buffer object as a texture image.
</p>

<p>
On top of the application windows, the
compositor draws its own user interface, such as a taskbar where the user
can interact with the compositor itself. Finally the topmost layer is
an indicator of what the user is currently interacting with; typically
a mouse pointer on desktop systems. Like applications, the compositor
renders with the regular user-space interfaces, such as Mesa's OpenGL or Vulkan.
</p>

<p>
The final building block to make all of this possible is the transfer mechanism
for buffer objects. In contrast to X, Wayland applications always run on the
same host as their compositor. Implementations are thus free to optimize for
this case: there's no network encoding, buffer compression, and so on
involved.
</p>

<p>
For transferring a buffer object that resides in system memory, the application
creates a file descriptor that refers to the buffer's memory, sends it over
the connection's stream socket (in a single, low-cost message),
and lets the compositor map the file descriptor's memory pages into its address
space. Both the application and the compositor have now established a
low-overhead channel for exchanging pixel data. 
The application draws into the shared-memory region and the compositor
renders from it. In practice it's also common to use multiple buffer
objects for double buffering. Wayland's surface-damage messages serve as
a synchronization method with low overhead.
</p>

<p>
Transferring data via shared memory is good enough for software rendering
but, for 
high-performance hardware rendering, it is insufficient. The application
would have to render on the graphics hardware and read back the result over
the slow hardware bus into the region of shared memory.
</p>

<p>
To avoid that penalty,
the graphics buffer has to remain in graphics memory. Wayland provides a
protocol 
extension to share buffer objects via a Linux <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/dma-buf.html">dma-buf</a>,
which represents a memory buffer that is shareable among 
hardware devices, drivers, and 
user-space programs.
An application renders its  scene graph via the
Mesa interfaces using hardware acceleration as described in part&nbsp;1, but,
instead of transferring a reference to shared memory, the application sends
a dma-buf object that references the buffer object while it is
still located in graphics memory. The Wayland compositor uses the stored pixel
data without ever reading it over the hardware bus.
</p>

<p>
Hardware-accelerated rendering is inherently asynchronous and therefore
requires synchronization. After the application has sent the current frame's
final rendering command to Mesa, it is not guaranteed that the hardware has
finished rendering. This is intentional and required for high performance.
But having the compositor display the content of a buffer object before the
hardware has completed rendering results in distorted output.
To avoid this from happening, the hardware signals when it has completed
rendering. This is called
fencing and the associated data structure is called a
fence. The fence is attached to the dma-buf object that the
application transfers to the
compositor. The compositor waits for the fence to signal completion
before it uses the resulting data for generating its own output.
</p>

<h4>
Pixels to the monitor
</h4>

<p>
After rendering the on-screen image, the compositor has to display it to
the user.
DRM's mode-setting code
controls all aspects of reading pixel data from graphics memory
and sending it to an output device. To do so, each driver
sets up a pipeline that models the pixel data's flow through the
graphics hardware. Each pipeline stage represents a piece of hardware
functionality that processes pixel data on its way to the monitor.
</p>

<p>
The minimum stages necessary are the framebuffer, plane, CRTC, encoder,
and connector, each of which is described below. For a working display
output, there has to be at least 
one active instance of each. But most hardware provides more than the minimum
functionality and allows for enabling and disabling pipeline stages
at will. The DRM framework comes with software abstractions for each
stage upon which drivers can build.
</p>


<p>
The pipeline's first stage is the DRM framebuffer. It is the buffer object
that stores the compositor's on-screen image, plus information about the image's
color format and size. Each DRM driver programs the hardware with this
information and points the hardware to the first byte of the buffer object,
so that the hardware knows where to find the pixel data.
</p>

<p>
Fetching the
pixel data 
is called scanout, and the pixel data's buffer object is called the scanout
buffer. The number of scanout buffers per framebuffer depends on the
framebuffer's color format. Many formats, such as the common <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>-based ones,
store all pixel data in a single buffer. With other formats, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%E2%80%B2UV">YUV</a>-based ones,
the pixel data might need to be split up into multiple buffers. 
</p>

<p>
Depending on the hardware's capabilities, the framebuffer can be larger or
smaller than the output's display mode. For example, if the monitor is set
to 1920x1080 pixels, it might only show a section of a much larger framebuffer.
Or, if the framebuffer is smaller than the display mode, it might only cover
a small area of the monitor, leaving some areas blank.
Hence, the pipeline's next stage locates the scanout buffer within the overall
screen.
In DRM terminology, this is called a plane. It sets the scanout
buffer's position, orientation, and scaling factors. Depending on the
hardware, there can be multiple active planes using different framebuffers.
All active planes feed their pixel output into the pipeline's third stage,
which is called
the cathode-ray tube controller (CRTC) for historical reasons.
</p>

<p>
The CRTC controls everything related to display-mode settings. The DRM
driver programs the CRTC hardware with a display mode and connects it with
all of its active planes and outputs. There can also be multiple 
CRTCs with different settings programmed to them. The exact 
configuration is only limited by hardware features.
</p>

<p>
Planes are stacked, so
they can 
overlap each other or cover different parts of the output. According to the
programmed 
display mode and each plane's location, the CRTC hardware fetches pixel
data from 
the planes, blends overlapping planes where necessary, and forwards the
result to 
its outputs. 
</p>

<p>
Outputs are represented by encoders and connectors. As its name 
suggests, the encoder is the hardware component that encodes pixel data
for an output.  An encoder is associated with a specific connector, which
represents the 
physical connection to an output device, such as
HDMI or VGA ports with a connected
monitor. The connector also provides information on the output device's
supported display modes, physical resolution, color space, and the
like. Outputs 
on the same CRTC mirror the CRTC's screen on different output devices.
</p>

<p>
The image below shows a simple mode-setting pipeline with an additional
plane for the mouse pointer, plus the buffer objects that act as scanout
buffers. Arrows indicate the logical flow of pixel data from buffer objects
to a VGA connector. This is a typical mode-setting pipeline for an older,
discrete graphics card.

</blockquote>

<h4>
Pipeline setup
</h4>

<p>
Deciding on policies for connecting and configuring the individual stages
of the mode-setting pipeline is not the DRM driver's job. This is left to
user-space programs, which brings us back to the compositor.
As 
part of its initial setup, the compositor opens the device file under
<tt>/dev/dri</tt>, such as <tt>/dev/dri/card1</tt>, and invokes the
respective <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls to program the display pipeline.
It also fetches the available
display modes from a connector and picks a suitable one.
</p>

<p>
After the 
compositor has finished rendering the first on-screen image, it programs 
the mode-setting pipeline for the first time. To do so, it creates a
framebuffer 
for the on-screen image's buffer object and attaches the framebuffer to
a plane. It then sets the display mode for its on-screen buffer on the
CRTC, connects all of the pipeline stages, from framebuffer
to connector, and enables the display.
</p>

<p>
To change the displayed image in
the next frame, no full mode setting is required. The compositor only
has to replace the current framebuffer with a new one. This is called
page flipping.
</p>

<p>
The individual stages of the mode-setting pipeline can be connected in a
variety of ways. A CRTC might mirror to multiple encoders, or a
framebuffer might be scanned out by multiple CRTCs. While this offers
flexibility, it also means that not all combinations of pipeline stages
are supported.
</p>

<p>
A naive implementation would apply each stage's settings
individually. It would first program the display mode in the CRTC, then
upload all buffer objects into graphics memory, then set up the
framebuffers and planes for scanout, and finally enable the encoders
and connectors. If anything fails during this procedure, the screen
remains off or (even worse) in a distorted state.
For example, with
limited device memory, it might not be possible to store the framebuffers
for more than one plane at a time. Switching modes, or even simple page
flips, might fail. Failing display updates have been a common problem
of graphics stacks ever since.
</p>

<p>
DRM's atomic mode setting solves this problem to some extent. The
mode-setting code tracks the complete state of all elements of the
pipeline in a compound data structure called <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/drm/drm_atomic.h#L348"><tt>drm_atomic_state</tt></a>, 
plus a sub-state for each stage in the pipeline.
This mode setting is
atomic in the sense that it either applies the full compound state
of all pipeline stages, or none of it. To make this work, mode-setting
involves two phases: first a check of the complete new atomic state
and second, if successfully checked, a commit of the same.
</p>

<p>
For checking, the DRM core, its helpers, and the DRM driver test the
proposed state against the limitations and constraints of the available
graphics hardware. For example, a plane has to verify that the attached
framebuffer is of a compatible color format and the CRTC has to verify
that the given display resolution is supported by the hardware. If
checking succeeds, the DRM driver programs the new state to hardware
during the commit phase. If state checking fails for one or more of the
stages, DRM stops the mode-setting operations and returns an error to the
user-space program.
</p>

<p>
So, when our compositor intends to program a display mode, it sets the atomic
state of all pipeline stages and applies them all at once. If successful,
the display output changes accordingly. For successive page flipping
operations, the compositor duplicates the current state, changes the
framebuffers to the new ones, and applies the new state.
Applying the page flip again results in an atomic-check/atomic-commit
sequence within the kernel's DRM code, but with less overhead than a
full mode-setting operation.
</p>

<p>
DRM's state-checking phase is independent of the hardware's state and
does not modify it. If checking an atomic state fails, the compositor
receives an error code, but the display output remains unchanged. It is
also possible for the compositor to verify atomic states without committing
them. This allows building a list of supported configurations beforehand.
</p>

<p>
For further reading, the inner workings of atomic mode
setting have been covered in detail on LWN back in&nbsp;2015:
<a href="/Articles/653071/">part&nbsp;1</a>
and
<a href="/Articles/653466/">part&nbsp;2</a>.
</p>

<h4>
Additional features
</h4>

<p>
In the discussion of planes, it has been assumed that all of the hardware's
planes are the same. But that's not always the case. There is usually a
plane, called the primary
plane, for RGB-like color formats, which covers the
whole display.
The compositor sets up the primary plane to display its on-screen image.
</p>

<p>
But most hardware provides an additional plane for the mouse pointer,
called the
cursor plane. This plane only covers a small area and floats above the
primary plane. As the name suggests, the compositor uses the cursor plane
to display the mouse-pointer image, which can now be moved around without
changing the primary plane's on-screen image at all.
<p>

<p>
Between the
primary and cursor plane are overlay planes, which are of
various sizes and often support YUV-like color formats. This makes them
suitable for displaying streams of video data with low CPU overhead. For
that, the 
video-player application provides the compositor with buffer objects
that contain the YUV-based pixel data.
</p>

<p>
The compositor sets up the overlay
plane with a framebuffer of the pixel data. The plane scans out
the YUV pixel data and performs the color conversion to RGB in hardware.
Using dma-buf, the video player can forward individual
YUV frames from a hardware video decoder directly to the compositor, thus
leaving the entire video processing
to hardware. 
</p>

<p>
If latency of the display update is of critical concern, it can be helpful to
hand over mode-setting capabilities to a single application. The compositor
therefore leases the functionality to the application. While an application
holds an active DRM lease, it has full control over the mode-setting pipeline.
This is useful for 3D headsets, which need to tightly coordinate the output
frequency and latency of their internal displays to make the 3D illusion work.
DRM leases expire or can be revoked, so the compositor ultimately
remains in control of mode setting.
</p>

<p>
While modern compositors use Wayland as their protocol, applications
for the X Window System are still common. Xwayland is an X server that
runs within a Wayland session. It lets X applications participate in
the Wayland sessions transparently by translating between Wayland and X
protocols. This works for most use cases.
</p>

<p>
The common use case Xwayland
cannot emulate is screen capturing and screen sharing. X applications
have access to the X session's whole window tree, which makes screen
capturing easy. For security purposes, the Wayland protocol does not allow
applications to read the screen or other application's windows. Wayland
compositors therefore provide dedicated implementations for capturing or
sharing the screen's content.
<a href="https://www.pipewire.org/">PipeWire</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a>,
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>
are commonly used for this functionality.
</p>

<p>
If no compositor is active, Linux displays a text console. DRM supports
the kernel's framebuffer console for text output. This
DRM fbdev emulation acts like a DRM client from user
space, but runs entirely within the kernel. It also provides the old
framebuffer interfaces, such as <tt>/dev/fb0</tt>. Fbdev and DRM's
fbdev emulation are on their way to retirement, though. There are <a
href="https://airlied.blogspot.com/2022/09/lpc-2022-gpu-bof-user-console-and.html">ideas</a> 
for moving much of the console functionality to user space.
</p>

<p>
At the time of writing this article, one quickly evolving topic for Linux
graphics is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-dynamic-range_rendering">High
Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering</a>,
which displays the output with more nuanced colors and lighting, thus
showing details that are often lost with traditional rendering. Support for
this  
will position Linux to fulfill the needs of professional graphics
artists.  Currently, support is still uneven, but it's possible to <a
href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1610200412854046720?t=5fb1Oi7zgMj8gOWGod8kWA">use
HDR in games</a> and Linux desktops are <a
href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/12/18/update-on-hdr-and-colormanagement-in-plasma.html">beginning
to implement HDR</a> as well.
</p>

<p>
At this point, we have followed the path of getting the
application's content onto the screen in the modern Linux graphics
stack—from rendering 
and memory management to compositing and mode setting. But we've
really just scratched the surface. The stack keeps evolving
and constantly adds support for new features and hardware.

The one thing I'm still a bit confused about is why PipeWire has anything to do with screen sharing.<br>
<p>
Could somebody explain? PipeWire is an entirely separate project from a compositor, so what does it do to get the screen data?<br>

Not an expert, but my understanding is the following:<br>
<p>
Pipewire is a thing that applications talk to to shuffle audio and video buffers around, optionally doing some extra processing. It has nothing to do with the compositor, but it's good at exposing reasonable audio/video APIs to apps.<br>
<p>
The wayland compositor is the only one with direct access the screen data. Actual implementations of the compositor are free to add their own stuff on top of the (small) base of wayland APIs, and they provide a permission system.<br>
<p>
Apps ask permissions through XDG Desktop Portals, which is a DBus API with an implementation for each desktop environment that might for instance show a pop up to the user with "X app wants to record your screen, Yay/Nay?"<br>
<p>
The implementation of the XDG portal for accessing the screen uses Pipewire for the logistics of passing buffers around, so that's why it sits in there in the middle between the compositor and the app asking for access. Pipewire asks the compositor, which pushes its data inside Pipewire, and the app gets the data from Pipewire through the portal.<br>
<p>
Pipewire and portals is just the de-facto standard in the implementation-specific world of Wayland compositors. Wayland as she is spoke.<br>

I totally get why Wayland is necessary, and applaud the work. There is a lot of obvious benefits that this series of articles helps detail.<br>
<p>
I still use Xorg on my personal systems because I still find it both cool and useful to occasionally forward X apps remotely via OpenSSH to my primary laptop. I will miss that feature when it is gone.<br>

FWIW I use waypipe at least every few days; it "feels" more bandwidth sensitive than classic X forwarding, but considerably less sensitive to connection latencies.<br>

I've seen it mentioned before but I haven't had the time to actually try it, what's the user experience with waypipe? I read the documentation and the examples but I'm still not sure.<br>
<p>
Do you need a new, dedicated SSH/waypipe session for each application or can you just connect to a remote machine, launch and close all the applications you want, even more than one at a time, and keep using the SSH session interactively for CLI tools?<br>

The latter. Waypipe works mostly the same as SSH X11 forwarding from the user PoV. Both can be active for the same SSH connection, and the user can choose Wayland or X per-application via environment variables.<br>

that may be cool too, but I don't think that X11 support in existing apps and libraries is going away anytime soon, even if the display is managed by a Wayland compositor, Xwayland is going to exist for a _loooong_ time to maintain compatibility with existing apps.  More than enough time to make a new standard default for new deployed systems and new apps out of the various ways you could forward existing apps over ssh with wayland if we wanted to deprecate X11 for new apps as it has been done for compositors/windowmanagers.<br>
<p>
Just the other day I forwarded an app over SSH/X11 onto Windows10/WSLg with Xwayland transparently and it worked the way it always has.<br>

<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2016-X.Org_Developers_Conference">X.Org Developers Conference</a>
</div>
<p>
James Jones started his 
<a
href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2016/">2016 X.Org 
Developers Conference</a> (XDC) talk by saying that he would like to make
some real progress at the conference on creating a user-space API for
allocating memory that is also accessible by various devices.  His talk on
day one of the conference set the stage for a meeting of interested
developers on day two.  By day three, he reported back in a lightning talk
on the progress made.
</p>

<p>
Jones has worked at NVIDIA on window system integration over the last decade or so,
which originally meant X11, but now also includes other
window systems.  There are some existing solutions for memory allocation,
but NVIDIA noticed some drawbacks to them when it tried to make them work
with its drivers.  So the company <a
href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2016-March/027547.html">proposed
EGLStream</a> as a solution, which was "not so well-received so far", but
it did help identify the problems that need to be solved.
</p>

<p>
That proposed patch added EGLStream to the Weston compositor, but it
launched a discussion of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(computer_graphics)#Generic_Buffer_Management">Generic
Buffer Management</a> (GBM), which Weston already uses for memory
allocation, versus EGLStream.  Many strong views were expressed in that
discussion; there has already been considerable investment in the existing
APIs, both by Mesa and Wayland developers as well as by NVIDIA, so it is not surprising
that there were differences of opinion.  But it was nice to have a civil
discussion about the memory allocation issue, he said, and many areas for
improvement were identified.  The discussion has died down and it was
suggested that XDC would be a good venue to make some progress on the issue.
</p>

<p>
The problem is how to allocate device-accessible surfaces (memory buffers for
various kinds of graphics and video data) from
user space.  The devices are things like GPUs, scanout engines, and video encoders and
decoders.  The surfaces allocated are for textures, images, and such; there
is a
need for some kind of handle for the surfaces that can be securely 
passed between user-space processes.  In addition, a way to
manage the surface
state (e.g. format, color parameters, compression) and its layout in memory
needs to be part of the API.  In order to use these buffers in different
parts of the system, some kind of synchronization mechanism is required.
The latter is not directly related to the allocation problem, but is something that
needs to be kept in mind, he said.
</p>

<p>
His goal is to get a consensus-based forward-looking API for surface
allocation, but he has "no idea" what that API will be, at least yet.  It
should be agnostic with regard to window systems, kernels, and 
graphics vendors.  So it will be able to be used for window systems like
Wayland and others, by old and new Linux kernels, and by other kernels beyond Linux,
as long as they are POSIX-like. 
It would have a "minimal but optimal driver interface" that would still be able to use
"100% of the GPU's capabilities".  While not directly related to surface
allocation, the "final destination", he said, is to have
"a completely optimized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene
graph</a>" for Weston and other scene-graph compositors. 
</p>

<h4>Prior art</h4>

<p>
Jones then went into a review of the existing solutions to this problem,
with their pros and cons—starting with GBM.  At the basic level, GBM has
the ability to allocate surfaces and to arbitrate the uses of a surface
with a set of flags.  It also provides handles to those surfaces.  It is
incorporated into many code bases at this point, so it is widely deployed
and well tested.  It has a pretty minimal API and fairly small
implementation. 
</p>

<p>
But GBM does have some shortcomings.  The handles are process-local; there
are ways to import handles from elsewhere, but not to export them to other
processes using the API.  It is
focused on GPU operations (texturing, rendering, and display), so there is
no way to specify that a surface would be used for rendering and passed to
a video encoder, for example.  Related to that is that the arbitration
for the capabilities needed by a surface is
done only in the scope of a single device, so you can't use the API to
specify surfaces that will be used with multiple devices.
</p>

<p>
The Chrome OS Freon project attempted to add surface state management
capabilities on top of GBM.  There was a lot of discussion
between vendors, but no consensus was reached on an optimal design, so
something "not ideal" was
settled on.  The
main point of contention was the level of abstraction in describing the
transitions between various uses of a surface.
</p>

<p>
Android's Gralloc has a similar feature set to GBM.  It has support for
synchronization using fence file descriptors, but passing handles between
processes requires other components from an Android system as there is no
direct support for it in Gralloc.  It has been widely deployed and is
proven in the field.  It also has an allocation-time usage specification
that has support for non-graphics usage (such as video encoders and decoders).
</p>

<p>
Many of the shortcomings of Gralloc are similar to those of GBM as well.
There is no explicit surface state management and the arbitration abilities
are flag-based.  It is open source, but the API is proprietary in some
sense, since Google controls it.
</p>

<p>
EGLStream was developed to solve the problems he described, so it is not
surprising that it provides allocation, arbitration, handles that can be
shared by different processes, state
management, and synchronization.  NVIDIA has been shipping EGLStream for
quite some time for a lot of different use cases, he said.  It has been
ported to all of the different operating systems that the company supports
and has a comprehensive feature set.
</p>

<p>
While EGLStream is an <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_stream.txt">open
standard</a>, in practice there is only a single 
vendor that has implemented it.  It does not have cross-device support and it
is EGL-based, which may complicate things by bringing OpenGL into the
picture.  It has been said that 
EGLStream does too much encapsulation and tries to do too much extra within the
API.  In addition, its behavior is loosely defined, or even undefined, in
some cases.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/474819/">DMA-BUF allocation mechanism</a> provides
handles to memory allocations 
that can be shared between drivers; it supports non-graphics devices as
well.  But it does not have a centralized user-space allocation API, is
Linux-only, and lacks any way to describe the content layout.  It also only
has a limited means to describe the planned usage of the memory at
allocation time.
</p>

<p>
The Vulkan 3D graphics and compute API is one other thing to consider,
Jones said.  It provides an allocation mechanism as well as the most
detailed allocation-time usage specification that he knows of.  It has explicit
state management and has a robust synchronization mechanism as well.
Vulkan is both
extensible and portable, but there is no support at this point for
cross-process handles or arbitration.  It is also focused only on graphics,
compute, and display operations.
</p>

<h4>Path forward</h4>

<p>
Based on the prior art and the needs going forward, a set of features needed was
identified and generally agreed upon.  Whatever the new API is, it should
be minimal—anything that is not 
needed should be eliminated.  It should also be portable to multiple
platforms and have support 
for non-graphics devices (e.g. rendering to a video encoder or texturing
from a video decoder).  It should also use the GPU optimally in the steady
state when someone is not moving windows around on the screen; X11 already
has this, so anything new should be at least as good.
</p>

<p>
To achieve that, he believes there is a need for something like what Vulkan
has in terms of an allocation-time usage specification.  So when the driver is
asked for an allocation, all of the different use cases for the surface can
be specified.  That will allow the driver to negotiate the surface
capabilities based on those use cases.  During transitions (such as moving
a window or going from a window to full screen), the performance still
needs to be good.  The idea is to allow multiple uses of the surface
without having to do reallocations.
</p>

<p>
So, there are various existing APIs and a set of more-or-less consensus
goals; what is the path forward?  He suggested focusing on solving specific 
problems that occur with the existing APIs, rather than trying to pick a
winner from those APIs.  By 
solving the problems, it will become clear what the API should look
like—what it
is called at that point is not particularly important.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, he suggested that the focus should be on how to create a
surface that is cross-driver,
cross-engine, and cross-device. Historically, that has been where
everything falls apart.  If agreement can be reached on that, other
simpler cases will just fall out naturally.
</p>

<p>
He presented a set of assumptions that he hoped would help simplify the
initial discussions.  To start with, those working on this problem should
assume they are designing an ideal allocation API.  That may not actually
be the case, but it is a good way to think about it.  Thinking in terms of
the user-space API first, while keeping both API elegance and the
capabilities of the hardware in mind, is also important.
</p>

<p>
There needs to be a standard way to describe the capabilities of different devices
(for example, devices have different tiling formats, but other drivers
won't know anything about some of those formats).  It could be similar to
the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/dataformat">Khronos data format
specification</a> but cover other types of capabilities beyond pixel data
formats.  

<p>
Capabilities could then be queried from each driver, though the
list could become quite large, so some filtering mechanism would be needed.
There would also need to be a central authority of some sort to maintain the
capability namespace.  That could simply be a file in a Git repository or,
perhaps, a group like Khronos—it simply needs to be authoritative.  The
surface allocation layer would collect up and intersect the capabilities of
all of the different drivers.
</p>

<p>
There is a question of how to filter these capabilities.  The API could
provide a way to describe the desired usage of the surface, including
things like its format, dimensions, and the operations that will be
performed using it.  The Khronos data format could again be used as a model
for how to describe this information.  Some types of data have obvious
representations (e.g. width/height) and others can be indicated using
Boolean flags like those in Gralloc.  But there would also be capabilities that
are driver-specific, so drivers would have to ignore ones that are targeted
at other devices.
</p>

<p>
Once the capabilities that are not supported by all of the involved drivers
have been eliminated, there needs to be a way to choose the optimal
remaining choice.  Sorting the remainder depends on the implementation and
usage, so it cannot be done by the common framework.  His straw-man
proposal was to let the application decide once the list has been narrowed down.
</p>

<p>
After the surface has been allocated, its chosen properties must also be
described.  That could perhaps use the same data format as the capability
information, but it must be communicated to the requester in some fashion.
</p>

<p>
He finished the presentation by noting that all of what had been discussed
thus far concerned the image-level capabilities for the requested memory.
But there are also some memory-level capabilities that may come into play,
notably whether the memory must be physically contiguous.  He thought that
the image capability concept could be generalized to cover the memory-level
requirements as well.  Extensibility to allow for tiling layouts or hardware
compression of surfaces, for example, would also be important.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
In Jones's lightning report of the meetings held on day two, he indicated that some good
progress had been made; agreement had been reached on some key points.  An
allocation request will contain some basic properties like width, height,
and format (others will be available via an extension mechanism) along with
a list of usage descriptions (e.g. render target, video encoder
input).  

<p>
The arbitration of the properties is based on intersected sets of
supported capabilities along with sets of constraints that get combined
together (e.g. a certain stride might constrain the alignment differently
between devices).  The exact
merging of the constraints may not exactly be the union of them, but the
merging algorithm will be baked
into the library, he said.  There will be a set of common capabilities, but
some can be vendor-specific; constraint definitions will be shared.
</p>

<p>
The capability sets will be reported back to the application, which can
serialize them to pass to other processes to allow for incremental
refinement.  Processes could ask that the list be filtered for specific
uses to help winnow down the choices.  Once that is done, the sorting is
handled by the drivers and the allocation takes place once a single
capability set has been chosen.   This API will be exposed via a library
that has user-space driver/vendor back-ends.
</p>

<p>
There are still plenty of things to be resolved, particularly how sorting the
capabilities is actually done.   There was a lot of discussion how that
might be handled, but no conclusion was reached.  In addition, the application may need to
be able to tell the hardware when the surface is only being used as one of
the use cases and when it transitions to one of the others, but how to do
that has not been determined.
</p>

<p>
How to specify format types is another unresolved piece and they did not
discuss the type of handle that would be used for an allocated surface.
There is a question whether devices will be enumerable using the API.
Also, which kernel interface would be used for allocation has not been
resolved.   Essentially, Jones said, it has reached a point where folks need to
go off and start doing some research and trying things out before further
progress can be made.

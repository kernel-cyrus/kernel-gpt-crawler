           </div>
The Linux directory entry ("dentry") cache is a key part of the kernel's
filename lookup mechanism.  The dentry cache speeds the process of looking
up files
considerably.  On systems with large numbers of cores, though, the dentry
cache has become a scalability problem for workloads which perform a lot of
lookups.  Nick Piggin's <a href="/Articles/419637/">dcache scalability
work</a> looks like it may be set to be merged for 2.6.38, but, according
to Nick, this work "<q>has had nowhere near enough review</q>".  The
code is complicated and tricky, which, certainly makes review harder.  Your
editor, never afraid to make a total fool of himself, will now attempt to
describe how this patch set works just in case it helps.
<p>

A dentry's core job is to represent a directory in the filesystem and to cache
the mapping between a name found within that directory and its associated
inode.  To that end, dentries are organized into a hierarchy which mirrors
the on-disk hierarchy found in the filesystem.  Each dentry looks vaguely
like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/dentry.png" alt="[dentry]" width=412
height=243>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every dentry keeps a list of children (names contained within the directory)
which can be looked up by name; each dentry also points to the inode it
represents, its parent dentry, and a number of other things.  Note that the
real situation is a bit more complicated than shown here; children are kept
in hashed lists for faster lookup, an inode with more than one link may
have more than one dentry pointing to it, and so on.  But, in a conceptual
sense, the above diagram shows what is going on.
<p>
When the VFS layer needs to turn a path provided by a program into a
pointer to the associated inode, it will perform this lookup through the
dentry cache.  The first step is to get to the starting point - which could
be the root of the filesystem (for absolute paths), the current working
directory (for relative paths), or a program-specified directory.  In the
first two cases, the associated dentries can be found by way of the
process's task structure.  The first component of the path is looked up in
the starting dentry, yielding a pointer to the next dentry in the path;
that process is repeated until the end of the path is reached.
<p>
It may be that some of the dentries in the path are not present in the
cache; there is not enough room in memory to cache the entire filesystem
hierarchy.  When that happens, the lookup code must ask the filesystem (by
way of the parent's inode operations) to perform the lookup; a dentry
structure can then be created with the result and inserted into the cache.
Of course, a lookup will fail if the file (or a component in the path) does
not exist; in that case, the VFS may insert a "negative dentry" into the
cache to speed up future failed lookups.  That optimization is important -
just run a simple command under <tt>strace</tt> to see how common failed
lookups really are.
<p>
The dentry cache is a dynamic data structure; dentries will come and go
frequently in response to filesystem changes  and the simple need to clean
out old dentries on occasion.  Clearly, some sort of protocol is needed to
prevent changes from colliding with each other; if one processor removes a
dentry while another is using it to look up a name, good things will almost
certainly not result.  Once upon a time, the global <tt>dcache_lock</tt>
was used to protect the cache during lookup operations.  The global lock
scaled poorly, so it has not been used for lookups for some time - though
it still does protect many other things.
<p>
Current kernels use <a href="/Articles/418853/">read-copy-update</a> to
manage the removal of dentries from the cache, so a lookup operation need
not worry about a specific dentry going away as long as that operation does
not block.  If a lookup has to call into the filesystem code, though,
things might indeed block; to ensure that a dentry will stay around in this
situation, a reference count is kept.  So, as a lookup works its way down
the hierarchy, it will increment the reference count of every dentry it
passes through.  Most of those references are eventually dropped, though
the reference on the final dentry must be kept as long as the file is held
open.
<p>

<span class="PullQuote">
<span class="invisible">[PULL QUOTE: </span>
Making path lookup truly scalable in a highly
parallel situation requires making no changes to the dentry structures
themselves.
<span class="invisible"> END QUOTE]</span>
</span>


The core of Nick's patch set is a new lookup algorithm called "RCU-walk." 
The key to RCU-walk is the idea that, on workloads where
pathname lookup is likely to present scalability problems, the chances are
good that most dentries will already be present in the cache.  One might
think that the current algorithm would perform well in such situations, but
there is a catch: the constant incrementing and decrementing of dentry
reference counts creates a great deal of cacheline bouncing - enough to
slow things considerably.  Making path lookup truly scalable in a highly
parallel situation requires making no changes to the dentry structures
themselves - turning the cache into a read-only data structure during the
lookup process, essentially.
<p>
So, when the new code needs to perform a path lookup, it starts with an
<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> call.  The dentry cache should then remain stable
enough for the lookup to get to the end of the path and increment the
reference count for the final dentry (only).  So lookups can be done
without locks - and, crucially, without changing any information in the
dentries passed through on the way.  That makes the lookup scalability
problems go away.
<p>
Of course, there are a few catches.  The most obvious of these is the
situation where one of the dentries in the path is not resident in the
cache.  At that point, the RCU-walk process must stop; the code will
attempt to obtain a reference on the final dentry it found, then return to
the older, reference-count-based method ("ref-walk") for the rest of the
lookup.  Sometimes, getting that mid-point reference will not be possible;
that situation will force the lookup to restart from the beginning using
ref-walk for the entire path.
<p>
More challenging, perhaps, is what happens if one of the dentries changes
while the lookup is passing through.  By normal RCU standards, that should
never happen; changing a structure requires making a copy and making the
changes there.  The dentry cache bends those rules, though; RCU is mostly
used to protect against dentry deletion there.  So, in particular, a rename
can cause a dentry to change attributes - and hashed lookup lists - while
another process is using it for a lookup.
<p>
Naturally, using a lock to protect against this possibility would wipe out
any scalability gains that would otherwise come from all of this work.  So
the RCU-walk code uses a <a href="/Articles/22818/">seqlock</a> instead.
Seqlocks do not prevent concurrent changes, but they do allow code to
detect when such a change has occurred.  Nick has added a seqlock to every
dentry which must be incremented whenever the associated name, parent, or inode
changes.  If the sequence number changes while a lookup is using a dentry, the
lookup will be restarted (with the seqlock write-locked, to prevent heavy
renaming from starving other operations indefinitely).  
For more information on the rename problem and
how it's handled, see <a href="/Articles/419826/">path-lookup.txt</a>,
which is included in the patch set.
<p>
The use of RCU has one other implication which forces a significant
change.  Directory permissions must be checked as part of every step in a
lookup operation to ensure that users don't access parts of the filesystem
which should not be available to them.  Permission checking is done by the
filesystem, by way of the <tt>permission()</tt> inode operation.  If this
checking is to happen safely during the RCU-walk process, the inode
structure must not go away while the lookup is in progress.  So, in other
words, inodes must now be freed with RCU rather than being released
directly.  The change is relatively straightforward, but it requires
tweaking every filesystem implementation in the tree, so the patch is
large.  
<p>
A number of other filesystem callbacks (<tt>d_compare()</tt> and
<tt>d_hash()</tt>, for example) have also had to be changed to support
RCU-walk.  Anybody maintaining an out-of-tree filesystem will have some
work to do if and when this patch set is merged.

<p>
While RCU-walk is perhaps the most significant change in this patch series,
it's far from the only one.  Many of the other patches are aimed at the
elimination of the global <tt>dcache_lock</tt> altogether.  There is a new
<tt>dcache_hash_lock</tt> to protect hashing operations, 
<tt>dcache_lru_lock</tt> for modifications to the dentry LRU list, and
<tt>dcache_inode_lock</tt> to protect inode dentry lists.  The scope of the
dentry <tt>d_lock</tt> spinlock has been expanded to cover changes to much
of the structure; the reference count (formerly an <tt>atomic_t</tt>) is
also covered by the lock now.  All told, it's a large set of patches making
fundamental changes to some of the core VFS code.
<p>
Interestingly, Nick also changed the dentry <tt>d_validate()</tt> callback,
which, he says, "<q>has been broken for a long time</q>".  That
function depended on a truly scary routine called
<tt>kmem_ptr_validate()</tt>, described this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This verifies that the untrusted pointer looks sane; it is _not_ a
	guarantee that the pointer is actually part of the slab cache in
	question, but it at least validates that the pointer can be
	dereferenced and looks half-way sane.
</div>
<p>
It is hard to imagine that such a function could be put to any sort of safe
use.  The only user in current kernels is <tt>d_validate()</tt>; Nick's
patch fixes that usage and gets rid of the function.  It seems unlikely to
be missed.
<p>
Given the complexity of this patch set, it is not surprising that reviews
have been relatively scarce.  Review time for VFS-related patches has
always been hard to come by, and these are trickier than most.  The ongoing
name-calling match between Nick and Dave Chinner, who has also been working
in this area, has not helped; neither has the fact that Al Viro appears to
have gone into one of his quiet periods.  Given that Linus seems fairly
well determined to merge this work, it would be good if at least some of
the inevitable glitches could be found before the 2.6.38 merge window.
Hopefully enough developers will find the time to review and/or test these
patches to make some progress in that direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That's pretty accurate! Sometimes the step crumbles before our hero gets to the next one. Sometimes the next step is missing completely.<br>
<p>
Fortunately there is a safety net at the bottom, and a less crumbly but slower staircase available.<br>
<p>
But actually operations that require a sequence count change are not so common, and path walks require sequence protection only briefly, so sequence count failure is quite rare. It's more common that the dentry is missing or some filesystem operation requires blocking, which can be handled more gracefully.<br>

While not directly related to the dcache scalability patch, one thing I have been curious is why there has never been an open relative to an open directory. It seems that would be useful for compiler type applications which have to search for files in several locations. The typical pattern is to prepend the search path to the file path and try to open. This causes the search path to have to be scanned multiple times just to get to the point of trying to open the file. If the open could be relative to a directory file descriptor, then the application could open every directory in the search path, and just open the file relative to each of those descriptors until the open succeeded. This would reduce the number of dentry cache looks which need to be done, for that specific workload.<br>
<p>
While I have no idea of the relative time savings this would provide, has there ever been a proposal to have such an alternate open call, or done any prototyping?<br>

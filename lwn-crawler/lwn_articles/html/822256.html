<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 10, 2020</br>
           </div>
<p> Kees Cook has been doing some thinking about plans for new <a
href="/Articles/656307/">seccomp</a> features to work on soon.  There were
four separate areas that he was interested in, which he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202005181120.971232B7B@keescook/">detailed</a> in a
lengthy mid-May message on the linux-kernel mailing list.  One of those
features, deep argument inspection, has been <a
href="/Articles/799557/">covered here before</a>, but it would seem that we
are getting closer to a resolution on how that all will work.  </p>

<h4>Deep arguments</h4>

<p>
Seccomp filtering (or "seccomp mode 2") allows a process to filter which
system calls can be made by it or its threads—it can be used to "sandbox" a program
such that it cannot make calls that it shouldn't.   Those filters use the "classic" BPF (cBPF)
language to specify which system calls and argument values to allow or disallow.  The <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
system call is used to enable filtering mode or to load a cBPF filtering
program.  Those programs only have access to the <i>values</i> of the
arguments passed to the system call; if those arguments are pointers, they
cannot be dereferenced by seccomp, which means that accepting or
rejecting the system call cannot depend on, for example, values in
structures that are passed to system calls via pointers—or even string values.
</p>

<p>
The reason that seccomp cannot dereference the pointers is to avoid the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">time-of-check-to-time-of-use</a>
(TOCTTOU) race condition, where  user space can change the value of what
is being pointed to between the time that the kernel checks it and the time
that the value gets used.  But certain system calls, especially newer
ones like <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone3()</tt></a>
and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html"><tt>openat2()</tt></a>,
have some important arguments passed in structures via pointers.  These new
system calls are designed with an eye toward easily adding new arguments
and flags by
redefining the structure that gets passed; in his email, Cook called these "extensible
argument" (or EA) system calls.
</p>

<p>
It does not make sense for seccomp to provide a mechanism to inspect the
pointer arguments of every system call, he said: "<q>[...] the grudging
consensus was reached that having seccomp do this for ALL syscalls was
likely going to be extremely disruptive for very little gain</q>".  But
for the EA system calls (or perhaps only a subset of those), seccomp could
copy the structure pointed to and make it available to the BPF program via its <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7.1/source/include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h#L51"><tt>struct
seccomp_data</tt></a>.  That would mean that seccomp would need to change
to perform that copy, which would require a <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> call,
and affected system calls would need to be seccomp-aware so that they can
use the cached copy if seccomp creates one.
</p>

<p>
There are some other wrinkles to the problem, of course.  The size of the
structure passed to the EA system calls may grow over time in order to add
new features. If the size is larger than expected on either side (user
space or kernel), finding or filling
zeroes in the "extra" space is specifically designed to mean that those new
features are unused (the <tt>openat2()</tt> man page linked above has some
good information on how this is meant to work).  Since user space and the
kernel do not have to be in 
lockstep, that will allow newer user-space programs to call into an older kernel and
vice versa.  But that also means that seccomp needs to be prepared to handle argument
sizes larger (or smaller) than "expected" and ensure that the zero-filling
is done correctly.
</p>

<p>
It gets even more complicated because different threads might have
different ideas of what the EA structure size is, Cook said:
<div class="BigQuote">
Since there is not really any caller-based "seccomp state" associated
across seccomp(2) calls, I don't think we can add a new command to tell
the kernel "I'm expecting the EA struct size to be $foo bytes", since
the kernel doesn't track who "I" is besides just being "current", which
doesn't take into account the thread lifetime -- if a process launcher
knows about one size and the child knows about another, things will get
confused.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He had suggestions of a few different possibilities to solve the problem,
but seemed to prefer the zero-fill option:
<div class="BigQuote">
 leverage the EA design and just accept anything &lt;= PAGE_SIZE, record
  the "max offset" value seen during filter verification, and zero-fill
  the EA struct with zeros to that size when constructing the
  seccomp_data + EA struct that the filter will examine. Then the seccomp
  filter doesn't care what any of the sizes are, and userspace doesn't
  care what any of the sizes are. (I like this as it makes the problems
  to solve contained entirely by the seccomp infrastructure and does not
  touch user API, but I worry I'm missing some gotcha I haven't
  considered.)
</div>
</p>

<p>
Others commenting also seemed to prefer that option, though Jann Horn <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez1LrQvR2RHD5-ZCEihL4YT1tVgoAJfGYo+M3QukumX=OQ@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>
that there is no need to zero-fill beyond the size that the kernel knows
about:
<div class="BigQuote">
We don't need to actually zero-fill memory for this beyond what the
kernel supports - AFAIK the existing APIs already say that passing a
short length is equivalent to passing zeroes, so we can just replace
all out-of-bounds loads with zeroing registers in the filter.
The tricky case is what should happen if the userspace program passes
in fields that the filter doesn't know about. The filter can see the
length field passed in by userspace, and then just reject anything
where the length field is bigger than the structure size the filter
knows about. But maybe it'd be slightly nicer if there was an
operation for "tell me whether everything starting at offset X is
zeroes", so that if someone compiles with newer kernel headers where
the struct is bigger, and leaves the new fields zeroed, the syscalls
still go through an outdated filter properly.
</div>
</p>

<p> Implementing that new operation would require changes to cBPF, however,
which is not going to happen, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAADnVQKRCCHRQrNy=V7ue38skb8nKCczScpph2WFv7U_jsS3KQ@mail.gmail.com/">according</a>
to BPF maintainer Alexei Starovoitov: "<q>cbpf is frozen.</q>" An
alternative would be for seccomp to switch to extended BPF (eBPF) for its
filters. Using eBPF would allow the filters to perform that operation
themselves without adding any new opcodes, but switching to eBPF is
something that Cook hopes to avoid.  As he explained in a <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAGXu5jKv3QFVKLhok1JWiPamE0b4CqLTO-hx8sP0KWED921=6w@mail.gmail.com/">message</a>
back in 2018, eBPF is something of fast-moving target, which worries him
from a security standpoint: "<q>[...] I want absolutely zero surprises
when it comes to seccomp</q>".  Beyond that, eBPF would add a lot more
code for the seccomp filter to interact with in potentially dangerous ways.  </p>

<p>
Aleksa Sarai, who is the developer behind the EA scheme, generally <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200519070929.55r3xvybjg6nnbsj@yavin.dot.cyphar.com/">agreed</a>
with Cook's plan for handling those structures, but he raised another
point.  The structures may contain pointers—those cannot be dereferenced
by seccomp either, of course. Should something be done so that the
filters can access that data as well?  When these "nested pointers" came up
in another discussion, Linus Torvalds made it abundantly clear that he
thinks that is not a problem that the kernel should deal with at all.
</p>

<h4>Less-deep arguments</h4>

<p>
A few days after his original post, Cook <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/202005200917.71E6A5B20@keescook/">posted</a> an
item on the ksummit-discuss mailing list to suggest that there be a session
at the (virtual) Kernel Summit in August to discuss these seccomp issues.
Torvalds <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/CAHk-=wierGOJZhzrj1+R18id-WdfmK=eWT9YfWdCfMvEO+jLLg@mail.gmail.com/">acknowledged</a>
that this kind of system call exists, but did not think there was much to
discuss with regard to seccomp:
<div class="BigQuote">
So I am not in the least interested in some kind of general discussion
about system calls with "pointers to pointers". They exist. Deal with
it. It's not in the least an interesting issue, and no, we shouldn't
make seccomp and friends incredibly more complicated for it.
<p>
[...] And if you have some actual and imminent real security issue, you
mention _that_ and explain _that_, and accept that maybe you need to
do that expensive emulation (because the kernel people just don't care
about your private hang-ups) or you need to explain why it's a real
issue and why the kernel should help with your odd special case.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Cook seemed somewhat relieved in his <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/202005201151.AFA3C9E@keescook/">response</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Perhaps the question is "how deeply does seccomp need to inspect?"
and maybe it does not get to see anything beyond just the "top level"
struct (i.e. struct clone_args) and all pointers within THAT become
opaque? That certainly simplifies the design.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner, who has also been doing a lot of development in these
areas, <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20200520202401.s22hstao4kzr5uma@wittgenstein/">agreed</a>
that the filters could likely live without the ability to chase pointers
any further than the top level.  Sarai would <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20200522040606.ec64dvpbldn3ufh3@yavin.dot.cyphar.com/">like
to see</a> there at least be a path forward if requirements of that sort do
arise, but seemed willing to keep things simple for now—perhaps forever.
</p>

<h4>io_uring</h4>

<p>
In his message on linux-kernel, Horn raised an interesting point for 
seccomp developers: handling <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a>.
Since its introduction in early 2019, io_uring has <a
href="/Articles/810414/">rapidly added features</a> that effectively allow
routing around the normal system-call entry path, while still performing the actions that a
seccomp filter might be trying to prevent.
<div class="BigQuote">
io_uring is growing support for more and more syscalls, including
things like openat2, connect, sendmsg, splice and so on, and that list
is probably just going to grow in the future. If people start wanting
to use io_uring in software with seccomp filters, it might be
necessary to come up with some mechanism to prevent io_uring from
permitting access to almost everything else...
</div>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the filters could simply disallow the io_uring system calls
entirely, but that may be problematic down the road.  Sarai <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200519024846.b6dr5cjojnuetuyb@yavin.dot.cyphar.com/">agreed</a>
that it is something that may need some attention.  Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202005181630.60E58CA0C5@keescook/">said</a> that he
needed to look more closely at io_uring: "<q>I thought this
was strictly for I/O ... like it's named</q>".  Trying to filter based
on the arguments to the io_uring system calls will be a difficult problem
to solve, since the actual commands and their arguments are buried inside a
ring buffer that lives in
an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
region shared between the kernel and user space.  Chasing pointers in that environment
seems likely to require eBPF—or even stronger medicine.
</p>

<p>
It would seem that a reasonable path for inspecting the first level of
structure "arguments" to <i>some</i> system calls has been identified.
<tt>clone3()</tt> and <tt>openat2()</tt> are obvious candidates, since
their flag arguments, which will help seccomp filters determine if the call
is "reasonable" under the rules of the sandbox, live in such structures.
On the other hand, complex, multiplexing system calls like <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
and <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
were specifically mentioned as system calls that would not make sense to
try to add the pointer-chasing feature.  Though Cook did not put any
timetable on his plans, one might think we will see this
feature sometime before the end of the year.

I'm not too familiar with these pointer-to-struct-to-pointer arguments, but I have to wonder if there are any structs where a given pointer field is only required to be initialized when an associated flag is set... if so, the deep copy logic would need to parse that information out, or else it would incorrectly dereference random garbage and EFAULT/SIGBUS. But that would imply that you need to know the callee's semantics, and therefore there isn't a general/declarative "recursively copy everything, and figure it out later" solution.<br>
<p>
Regardless, this is obviously a lot more complicated than a single call to (the moral equivalent of) memcpy(), which is probably why Linus doesn't want to do it.<br>

It doesn't seem to make sense to filter io_uring at the syscall level. In the most extreme case, when would seccomp enter the picture with IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL? And what would it do if one of SQEs were refused based on seccomp, but not others? Hard to see how seccomp would queue CQEs for individual commands.<br>
<p>
Seems like you'd have to have some integration at a different level, perhaps when io_uring gets SQEs from the ringbuffer. <br>

      If I may fill in some history how we ended up with esyscalls. The versioning-by-size (vbs) idea behind extensible syscalls has already been expressed in sched_setattr() and perf_event_open() for a long time (with some ABI quirks).

When I did clone3() we quickly shifted to a design that would allow for it to be easily extended or re-versioned. So I added a local and simple version of the later copy_struct_from_user() similar to what was done in other places to clone3() in 7f192e3cd316ba58c88dfa26796cf7 that implemented vbs.

<pre>+noinline static int copy_clone_args_from_user(struct kernel_clone_args *kargs,
+                                             struct clone_args __user *uargs,
+                                             size_t size)
+{
+       struct clone_args args;
+
+       if (unlikely(size &gt; PAGE_SIZE))
+               return -E2BIG;
+
+       if (unlikely(size &lt; sizeof(struct clone_args)))
+               return -EINVAL;
+
+       if (unlikely(!access_ok(uargs, size)))
+               return -EFAULT;
+
+       if (size &gt; sizeof(struct clone_args)) {
+               unsigned char __user *addr;
+               unsigned char __user *end;
+               unsigned char val;
+
+               addr = (void __user *)uargs + sizeof(struct clone_args);
+               end = (void __user *)uargs + size;
+
+               for (; addr &lt; end; addr++) {
+                       if (get_user(val, addr))
+                               return -EFAULT;
+                       if (val)
+                               return -E2BIG;
+               }
+
+               size = sizeof(struct clone_args);
+       }
+
+       if (copy_from_user(&amp;args, uargs, size))
+               return -EFAULT;</pre>

At the same time, Aleksa was working on openat2() and copied the vbs logic from clone3() at which point we realized that it would probably make sense to add a copy_struct_from_user() that would implement vbs and expose it to the kernel in general. This logic was pulled in e524d16e7e324039f2a9f82e302f0a39ac7d5812 before openat2() landed. Then all the current custom vbs implementations were replaced by this (At least the ones where it could easily be done.) and the openat2() patchset switched over to it as well.

Doesn't this mean old user-space compiled with a than smaller struct ceases to work?<br>

This used to be the code before the first extension. Now it checks fir the minimal size aka the size of the first supported struct.<br>

<h1>SCSI command filtering</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 31, 2006 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Burning data to a CD or DVD is a complicated task, involving the use of a
wide range of SCSI commands.  So, any application which burns discs must
have the ability to send special SCSI operations to the drive.  Just before
the 2.6.8 kernel came out, however, the kernel developers decided that
applications should not be able to send just <i>any</i> SCSI command.  Some
of those commands could lead the drive to rewrite its firmware, catch fire,
or replace music tracks with recordings of Richard Stallman singing.  In an
attempt to keep such undesirable things from happening, Linus <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/98379/">added a late patch</a> which blocked
unprivileged users from using
any SCSI commands  which do not appear in an
in-kernel whitelist.

<p>

It is almost certainly true that no user ever destroyed a CD drive with a
2.6.8 system.  In fact, very few of them even wrote discs; the filtering at
that stage was so severe that unprivileged users could not do anything
useful at all.  Subsequent updates made things better, however, and by
about 2.6.10 burning worked again for most users.
<p>

Not for all users, however.  As Dave Jones recently <a
href="/Articles/193518/">noted</a> on the linux-scsi list, the command
filtering still trips up some Plextor drives.  The cdrecord utility tries
to send  vendor-specific commands to those drives, but the kernel
filters them out.  Everything then comes to a halt, and the user must retry
the operation as root to get the job done.  Dave asked: might it be a good
idea to add a per-vendor exceptions capability to the filtering code?
<p>

The response which came back from a couple of block subsystem developers
was that the command filtering should simply be taken out altogether.
Evidently this topic had been discussed at the recent storage summit, and
the participants had agreed that this feature should be removed.  James
Bottomley <a href="/Articles/193519/">put it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 If we're going to allow users access to burn CDs, it's impossible
	 to police them with certainty as this case indicates.  If we allow
	 vendor specific commands down, there are bound to be some that
	 format the drive or destroy the firmware...
	 <p>
	 So I think ripping the table out and acknowledging we have no
	 security is better than giving the illusion of having it.
</div>
<p>

There are a number of complaints about the filtering code.  It is a way of
encoding policy in the kernel, which is generally frowned upon - even
though the policy, in this case, is really an attempt to enforce a
difference between access to a disc within a drive and access to the drive
itself.  The command list will never be entirely correct; it seems that
some drives must receive the appropriate, vendor-specific incantations or
they will refuse to write discs.  Some commands mean different things to
different types of devices; what's safe for a CD burner might be a
destructive operation on a different SCSI-like device.  It also doesn't
help that there are, in fact, two different SCSI command filters in the
kernel (one in <tt>drivers/scsi/sg.c</tt>, the other in
<tt>block/scsi_ioctl.c</tt>) which implement different policies.  For all of these
reasons, attendees at the storage summit apparently agreed to take the
filtering out.
<p>
There's just one little problem with this plan: Linus <a
href="/Articles/193526/">feels differently about filtering</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Put another way: you will remove that command filtering in
	block/scsi_ioctl.c only in a kernel that I don't maintain, or by
	disabling it in some way that is so hidden that I won't
	notice. Because I'm not so stupid as to think that it's ok for
	normal users to set driver passwords or rewrite the disk firmware
	just because they have write permissions to the device. That's
	pretty damn final.
</div>
<p>
This statement would appear to be pretty damn final.  That does not mean
that the situation cannot be improved, however.  The leading idea at the
moment would appear to be to allow a privileged user to make changes to the
command filter table.  Distributions could then ship tools which detect
problematic devices and modify the filtering tables accordingly; the whole
thing could be transparently integrated with the hotplug functionality.
Jens Axboe has <a
href="http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bfd0060d0feb5f3ba161c2c1e6e8082fe2f68d">a
patch</a> (originally from Peter Jones) which turns the filter list into a
per-device object, tweakable through sysfs, so each device could have its
own set of exceptions.
<p>
Just how this interface works may yet require some discussion to nail
down.  But the configurable, per-device filter looks like the way forward.
It retains the filtering of dangerous commands while moving the policy
decisions to user space.  Once the policy can be changed, distributors can
do the work to ensure that specific devices are well supported, or, if they
prefer, simply mark all commands as "allowed" and, for all practical
purposes, remove the filter altogether.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Linus is right, as usual.<br>
<p>
The kernel should definitely offer the hooks for SCSI command filtering, so that an unprivileged user can't fry the hardware. It's really no different to stopping him from oopsing the OS or corrupting the filestore.  However, the details of the filtering for each model of drive need not be the responsibility of the kernel maintainers, when they can be tweaked via a system startup script. Let ZZZ, or someone who maintains ZZZ burners, supply the necessary definitions for a ZZZ-1234 drive, if the defaults are unsafe or over-restrictive. There's an analogy with netfilter here. Who would argue for the removal of netfilter, even though its default state is to do nothing?<br>

      Its default state isn't to do nothing.  By default, for example, you can't do MODE SELECT as a normal user.  The reasoning seems good at face value; you can use it to e.g. set hard drive passwords.  But for some devices, you have to be able to do that.  Some CD drives, for example, can't be used to rip CDs without first issuing a MODE SELECT.  So it's not as black and white as one would hope.  Sometimes you don't want a user to be able to do something, and sometimes they have to be able to do it.<br>
<p>
It really is per-device.  Each device's version of the SCSI command set has some variation, and on some you need to do things which on others you do not.  The filter needs to be modifiable accordingly.<br>

           <i>Linus is right, as usual.</i>

<p>
Well... what do you do if you can't figure out how to burn CDs as ordinary user? I, for one, do it as root. Or install cdrecord suid root. My guess is that most people would do it that way. Just bypass the SCSI command filter. You know that it's bad, but being unable to burn is even worse. That's the kind of thing people do if overly repressive security measures get in their way.

<p>
If you have a large server with lots of users you can't trust, it'd be a good idea to disable write access to the CD drive for ordinary users altogether.

<p>
Or restrict writing to those users you can trust. Or use a security framework such as SELinux to allow only some trusted applications (such as cdrecord) to write to the device.

<p>
I really see no need for a kernel-based filter. If CD burning is really the only real world application in which non-priviledged users need to send special SCSI commands, as the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194106/">joey's comment</a> suggests, moving the cdrecord functionality into a kernel driver seems more approriate than filtering arbitrary commands.

      Presumably if you can rewrite the firmware, then with a bit of effort you can create some firmware which will use DMA to overwrite arbitrary sections of memory - in other words, all your security has just gone out the window on any machine with local users and an attached CD/DVD drive.<br>
<p>
Sounds like Linus is right ...<br>

<p>
Not really.  SCSI devices are connected through HBAs (i.e. SCSI cards); the HBA has DMA access but the SCSI device itself does not.  Rewriting the firmware of the SCSI device wouldn't grant arbirtary access to system memory; you would have to alter the firmware on the HBA or change the HBA driver to do that.<br>

      But the modified firmware could return something different on a read than what is on the CD, so when the sysadmin thinks that he is loading some new program he is actually loading something else.<br>

      IANAKH, but doesn't this show that there is something fundamentally wrong with needing a userspace program that knows about different drive hardware, the scsi commands each needs etc and sends raw commands to the hardware? Why arn't they considering an abstraction layer? Fer instance:<br>
<p>
cat foo.iso &gt;/dev/cd_burn<br>

Seems to me that device drivers exist to avoid exactly this kind of problem..<br>

      So, I haven't been able to use cdrecord as a non-root user since 2.6.8.1 was released. I assumed that this was intended, and that everyone changed to running cdrecord as root. Is this not the case? Should I instead file a bug against the SCSI command filtering?<br>

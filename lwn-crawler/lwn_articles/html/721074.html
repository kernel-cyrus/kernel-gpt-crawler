The Linux kernel is highly scalable but, while it runs nicely on the
world's largest computers, it is not an entirely comfortable fit on the
smallest.  The difficulties involved in running Linux on machines with 1MB
or less of memory have left an opening for other operating systems, such as
<a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>, with lower memory
needs.  Some developers have not given up on scaling Linux to the smallest
computers, but the approaches they have to take have always been a bit of a
hard sell with the rest of the development community.  Nicolas Pitre's <a
href="/Articles/718673/">minitty</a> patch set is a case in point.
<p>
The kernel's terminal (TTY) layer supports a long list of hardware and no
end of features.  It is a complex subsystem that must support decades of
Unix and Linux history; core-kernel developer Ingo Molnar once <a
href="/Articles/243968/">confessed</a> that the TTY code is "<q>one of 
the very few pieces of kernel code that scares the hell out of me</q>".
It is also quite large, weighing in at about 46KB of compiled code without
the low-level hardware drivers.  46KB is not a lot of memory on a typical
desktop system, or even on a mobile handset but, in situations where every
byte counts, it hurts.
<p>
When Pitre set out to find a way to slim down the TTY subsystem for small
systems, he ran into some problems.  The TTY code has a multi-layer design
to give it the maximum amount of flexibility; each layer adds overhead.
Line disciplines — 
modules that manage the low-level protocols used on serial lines — can be
plugged in and out, and the kernel supports about two dozen of them.  The
line disciplines themselves are easy to leave out, but the infrastructure
that allows them to be modular is not optional.  The TTY layer is designed
to support pseudoterminals, and it is able to support dozens of ports
running at full speed — an important feature in the early days of Linux.
Pitre concluded that there is no way to make this infrastructure optional
without worsening performance or functionality for those who need it.

<p>
So, instead, he went and wrote an entirely new TTY subsystem called
"minitty".  About the only thing it can do is move data over a hardware
serial port.  There are no pseudoterminals, no choice of line disciplines,
no job control, and not much of anything else.  What it does provide is the
ability to get debugging information out of the system via a serial port or
to run simple login sessions.  Minitty shares the TTY layer's low-level hardware
drivers, though, and it provides a standard (if limited) interface to user
space.  And, importantly, it does that in 8KB of memory — about 1/6 of what
is required by the standard TTY layer.
<p>
Minitty seems like a clear win for extremely small Linux deployments, but
it quickly ran into trouble on the mailing list.  Kernel developers have a
strong aversion to duplicated subsystems, and for a number of good
reasons.  This kind of duplication forces choices onto distributors and
users that they may not be in a position to make.  It can split development
effort between multiple competing implementations, bugs present in both
subsystems are often only fixed in one, and maintenance can be complicated
if changes to one subsystem can break the other.  So it is not entirely
surprising that minitty has drawn some unfavorable responses.
<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman, the current maintainer of the TTY layer, <a
href="/Articles/721081/">described</a> it as "<q>a horrid thing to
do</q>" and advised Pitre to work with the existing code instead:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So please, take what we have, refactor, and carve things up so that
	the _same_ code paths are being used for both "big and little" tty
	layers.  That way _everyone_ benefits, no need to have totally
	separate code paths, and totally different files that different
	people maintain.
</div>
<p>
Other developers also made their opposition to a separate TTY layer known.

Pitre is not so easily discouraged, though.  He <a
href="/Articles/718401/">reiterated</a> that the TTY layer simply cannot be
shrunk to the same degree: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Let's be honest here: the existing code _could_ possibly be reduced
	of course. That would require a lot of efforts to gain 50%
	reduction maybe?  What I'm looking at with my proposal here is a 6x
	reduction factor and I'm still not done with it. There is no way I
	could do that with the existing code.
</div>
<p>
Most of his message (which is worth reading in its entirety) was devoted to
explaining why he thinks a tiny TTY layer is so important.  Linux is simply
not a viable kernel for the smallest systems without the ability to make it
as small as possible.  But there is a great advantage to using Linux in
such settings.  Linux is well maintained and well debugged; security issues
are fixed (relatively) quickly there.  If a target system is running Linux,
developers can write and debug their code on an ordinary desktop Linux
system and, with a bit of care, expect it to work unmodified on the target
system.  All of the existing Linux-based development tools will be
available, and existing Linux developers already know how to develop for
such targets.
<p>
The ability to shrink the kernel in this way is, according to Pitre, a
crucial part of making Linux successful in the smallest Internet-of-things
settings.  A smaller TTY layer is only the beginning; he would eventually
like to come up with miniaturized versions of many other kernel subsystems
as well.  Accommodating these mini-subsystems will require a bit of a
change to the normal kernel development model, he said, but the rewards
will be more than worth the cost.
<p>
At least part of this message seems to have gotten through; Kroah-Hartman
<a href="/Articles/721086/">responded</a> to the most recent posting by
saying: "<q>I agree with your goal of getting Linux running on these
very tiny chips, I want that to happen too</q>".  If minitty can find
its way to acceptance, that may eventually open the door to other
tinification efforts; one should remember that this is the kernel community
we're talking about, though, so expect a lengthy discussion for each proposal.
Getting this kind of work merged will never be easy but, just
maybe, the community will be able to accept enough of it to help ensure
that the kernel is competitive in the smallest of deployments.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Indeed, duplicating the code must be a no-no.<br>
<p>
But since current TTY subsystem is a huge mess, it worth throwing it out, replacing with something equivalent but properly architected.<br>
<p>
If such an effort is started already, why stopping with minimal implementation? If designed properly, optional layers might be disabled if necessary.<br>

It does, however, have the problem of an extensive and under-specified userspace semantics, with no comprehensive test suite.<br>

The last time someone tried to significantly overhaul the TTY layer, they ran into obscure issues with bits of the interface that only emacs used, and almost nothing else.<br>

Well, indeed. That's why a tiny reimplementation for those small systems only is preferable to uglifying the existing one in an attempt to make all the abstraction layers optional. Throwing out the TTY layer wholesale and replacing it with something "properly architected" (without any evidence that what we have now is poorly architected for its intended use case, which does not include 1MiB RAM IoT boxes), as the original commenter suggested, is quite different.<br>
<p>
(A better API without all the horror shows of the existing one around job control, signal handling, ioctls etc would be nice too, but it sounds like minitty just throws most of that out since none of it is needed for its use case -- and for any other use case, the better API would have to coexist with the horrible existing one that everything uses in any case, and because that API is so ancient and widely used there really could never be a sunset period for it -- like it or not, we're stuck with SIOC* forever.)<br>

I wonder if cleaning up the TTY layer would open a path to make the framebuffer console layer less awful. Its emulation of a 1980s dumb terminal—including the redraw speed of one—is a little too accurate for my tastes. This is only getting worse as screen resolutions increase.<br>

So Pitre honourably strives to make new mini implementations of various Linux subsystems with the goal of shrinking the kernel to work on tiny IoT devices.<br>
<p>
Isn't the logical conclusion of such work essentially a _new_ kernel with some interfaces compatible with the Linux kernel (syscall, drivers, netlink etc...).<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be better to take an existing hardened RTOS or small kernel and add Linux interface compatibility?  Doesn't this just point to the unsuitability of the Linux kernel to tiny IoT devices?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Isn't the logical conclusion of such work essentially a _new_ kernel with some interfaces compatible with the Linux kernel (syscall, drivers, netlink etc...).</font><br>
<p>
That's certainly what it sounds like to me.  I don't see how you you benefit from active maintenance of the kernel if you throw huge chunks of it away.<br>

It's not all-or-nothing. For example, you might want a couple of full-scale feature-rich subsystems and to get them you just need to throw a switch in the config file. With a separate OS you'll have to actually reimplement the full-scale systems (with all the resulting bugs and issues).<br>

That is IMHO sophistry.  The same argument for an emulation layer, could have been used in the 90's for multi-cpu large memory systems.  Who runs Minix now?  Linux would have been a dead end, without scaling efforts, even in mobile phones.<br>
<p>
In the long run, who knows what parts of the kernel will become irrelevant in some deployments?<br>
<p>
Many people may not see tinification effort benefits, but making software more adaptable opens up new possibilities and can drive growth as it's deployed more widely, as well as enhancing survival characteristics.<br>

I think the ambition is to reuse the major parts, especially all device drivers, MMU and other arch code and the system call interface and just shrink down the subsystems that actually are just too bloated.<br>
<p>
Of course it is possible to fork, or maintain a separate kernel, but history tell us it is not a good idea.<br>

The impression I get from this article is that the author of the new subsystem does not want to put the effort into understanding and changing the existing TTY code, because it is large and complicated. That is understandable. It's also understandable that those responsible for long-term maintenance of the Linux kernel do not want to maintain the new code in addition to the existing TTY code. The two have different priorities: one the narrow task of providing a simplified TTY interface for low-memory computers, the other the wider task of long-term stability and maintainability of all the TTY interface code.<br>
<p>
If it is really so vital that these low-memory systems are supported, then I expect that someone will do the work to implement the new functionality in a way that works well with the existing code, not increasing the total complexity as much as a completely new and separate subsystem would.<br>

      That is not a correct impression and I apologize if the article suggested that. Nico understands the tty subsystem very well, but does not believe it can be made small without impacting other use cases.

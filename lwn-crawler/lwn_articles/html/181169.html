<h1>The splice() weekly news</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 24, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Jens Axboe sent around <a href="/Articles/181170/">a note on the status of
<tt>splice()</tt></a>.  He notes that the <tt>splice()</tt> and
<tt>tee()</tt> interfaces - on both the user and
kernel side - should be stable now, with no further changes anticipated.
The <tt>sendfile()</tt> system call has been reworked to use the
<tt>splice()</tt> machinery, though that process will not be complete until
after the 2.6.18 kernel cycle opens.
<p>

While <tt>splice()</tt> might be stable, things are still happening.  In
particular, Jens has added <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/180936/">yet
another system call</a>:
<p>
<pre>
    long vmsplice(int fd, void *buffer, size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
While the regular <tt>splice()</tt> call will connect a pipe to a file,
this call, instead, is designed to feed user-space memory directly into a
pipe.  So the memory range of <tt>len</tt> bytes starting at
<tt>buffer</tt> will be pushed into the pipe represented by <tt>fd</tt>.  The
<tt>flags</tt> argument is not currently used.
<p>
Using <tt>vmsplice()</tt>, an application which generates data in a memory
buffer can send that data on to its eventual destination in a zero-copy
manner.  With a suitably-sized buffer, the application can do easy
double-buffering; half of the buffer can be under I/O with
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> while the other half is being filled.  If the buffer is
big enough, the application need only call <tt>vmsplice()</tt> each time
half of the buffer has been filled, and the rest will simply work with no
need for multiple threads or complicated synchronization mechanisms.
<p>

Getting the buffer size right is important, however.  If the buffer is at least
twice as large as the maximum number of pages that the kernel will load
into a pipe at an given time, a successful <tt>vmsplice()</tt> of half of
the buffer can be safely interpreted by the application as meaning that the
<i>other</i> half of the buffer is no longer under I/O.  Since half of the
buffer will completely fill the space available within a kernel pipe, that
half can only be inserted when all other data has been consumed out of the
pipe - in simple situations, anyway.  So, after <tt>vmsplice()</tt>
succeeds, the application 
can safely refill the second half with new data.  If the application gets
confused, however, it could find itself overwriting data which has not yet
been consumed by the kernel.
<p>

Jens's patch adds a couple of <tt>fcntl()</tt> operations intended to help
in this regard.  The <tt>F_GETPSZ</tt> operation will return the maximum
number of pages which can be inserted into a pipe buffer, which is also the
maximum number of pages which can be under I/O from a <tt>vmsplice()</tt>
operation.  There is also <tt>F_SETPSZ</tt> for changing the maximum size,
though that operation just returns <tt>EINVAL</tt> for now.  Linus,
however, <a href="/Articles/181176/">worries</a> that this information is
not enough to know that a given page is no longer under I/O.  In situations
where there are other buffers in the kernel - perhaps just another pipe in
series -
the kernel could still have references to a page even after that page has
been consumed out of the original pipe.  Networking adds some challenges of
its own: if a page has been <tt>vmsplice()</tt>ed to a TCP socket, it will
not be reusable until the remote host has acknowledged the receipt of the
data contained within that page.  That acknowledgment will arrive long
after the page has been consumed out of the pipe buffer.
<p>

What this all means is that the <tt>vmsplice()</tt> interface probably
needs a bit more work.  In particular, there may need to be yet another
system call which will allow an application to know that the kernel is done
with a specific page.  The current <tt>vmsplice()</tt> implementation is
also unable to connect an incoming pipe to user-space memory.  Making the
read side work is a rather more complicated affair, and may not happen
anytime in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Very interesting!  Granted, it's a microbenchmark, but it still shows a place where Linux wasn't scaling as well as one would like.  (In this case, it was a pretty dramatic fall off.)<br>

      Some corrections to this article, which are excusable since it was probably done prior to 2.6.17-rc3 being released with vmsplice included:<br>
<p>
The syscall actually looks like this now:<br>
<p>
long vmsplice(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, unsigned long nr_segs, <br>
              unsigned int flags);<br>
<p>
So you can pass in several chunks and get them spliced into the pipe in one go. The fcntl() bits are removed for now, as the article mentions it isn't completely clear how we'll handle the reuse case yet.<br>

      Seems like there is a more familiar interface for saying "write this data at some point, and let me know when you are done so I can reuse (or de-mmap) this memory", namely aio_write (or lio_listio where there are several noncontiguous blocks of memory).<br>
<p>
Now, there might be various semantic differences (like whether one has to write entire pages or can write less), but I'm curious whether the two things could/should be separate or unified.<br>

      isn't so much how to notify reusability, but rather when to determine the safety of doing so. We still need to change a bit of infrastructure for this - eg, get rid of -&gt;sendpage() and actually pass the pipe_inode_info down for network transmit and only have it do the -&gt;release on the buffers when they have been sent out. The issue right now is that the -&gt;release is done as soon as we pass the page to the network stack, which is too soon of course.<br>

      Determining completion is indeed tricky, especially where remote hosts  <br>
are involved.  But there are already two good choices for the interface:   <br>
write() blocks until the buffer may be reused by the application,  <br>
aio_write() instead posts a notification.  What does vmsplice() add?  <br>
  <br>
(Changing to a vector operation changes the names of the functions, but  <br>
not the nature of the question).  <br>

      Blocking on the next vmsplice comes automatically, since you can't replace buffers that haven't been -&gt;release'd yet. So that's how it already works. As I said, the missing bit is getting the release right.<br>

      It's disappointing to see this proliferation of system calls, which will now need to be supported forever.  Couldn't we have the VM system integrated with I/O and network buffering, similar to NetBSD's UVM, and just use read() and write() with suitably page-aligned and mmapped buffers?  Or am I missing something essential?<br>

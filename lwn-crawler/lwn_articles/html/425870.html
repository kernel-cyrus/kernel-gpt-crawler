Wacom tablets are often the tool of choice for those who need accurate and
flexible input devices; they seem to be especially favored by artists.
Like a mouse, these tablets can report position and movement, but they can
also present multiple input devices to the system (one for each of several
different types of pens, for
example) and report variables like pen angle, pressure, and more.  Support
in Linux for these 
devices has not been as good as one might like, but, as Peter Hutterer
described in his talk at the linux.conf.au Libre Graphics Day miniconf, it
is getting better quickly.  How that came to be is a classic example of how
to (or how <i>not</i> to) manage kernel driver development.
<p>
Peter is the maintainer for the bulk of the graphical input drivers.  He
has, he says, rewritten most of that subsystem, so he is to blame for the
bugs which can be found there.  Most input devices are easily handled
through the evdev abstraction, but the Wacom driver is an exception.  The
things which are unique to these tablets (multiple input "devices," one
associated with each pen, the pressure, tilt, and rotation axes, and the
relatively high resolution) require a separate driver for their support.
Thus, Wacom users must have the linuxwacom driver in their systems.
<p>
There is some confusion about the linuxwacom driver, because there are
multiple versions of it, all of which can be found on <a
href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.  One version
(0.8.8) is created by Wacom itself; it is a classic vendor driver, Peter

<a href="/Articles/425882/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lca/PeterHutterer-sm.jpg" width=150 height=218
alt="[Peter Hutterer]" border=0 align="right" hspace=2></a>

said, with everything that usually implies about the development process
(code dumps) and the quality of the code itself.  This driver ships as a
tarball containing a wild set of permutations of kernel and X.org versions;
it's a mess.  But it's Wacom's mess, and the company has been resistant to
efforts to clean it up.
<p>
Peter got fed up with this situation in 2009 and forked the driver.  His
version is now the default driver in a number of distributions, and is the
only one which supports newer versions of the X server.  Looking at the
repositories, Peter found 78 commits total before the fork, all from
Wacom.  After the fork, there are 788 commits, 65% from Red Hat, and 12%
from Wacom.  Extracting the driver from its vendor-dominated situation has
definitely helped to increase its rate of development.
<p>
Surprisingly, the original vendor driver is still under development by
Wacom, despite the fact that it does not support current X servers and is
not shipped by any distributors.  The original mailing list is still in
business, but, Peter warned, one should not ask questions about the new
driver there.  Kernel development, he said, should be done on the
linux-kernel mailing list.  There is also little point in talking to him
about problems with the older driver; Wacom insists on keeping control over
that code.
<p>
<b>Update</b>: Peter tells us that there are three mailing lists (linuxwacom-announce, linuxwacom-discuss and linuxwacom-devel) which are still the place to go for general questions, including hardware-specific questions.   X driver development for the forked driver happens exclusively on linuxwacom-devel and all patches are sent there.
So the mailing lists are definitely the place to ask questions, at least in
regards to the X driver.  The kernel driver is the exception here. Kernel driver development should happen on LKML, not on linuxwacom lists.

<p>
Much of the work Peter has done so far has been toward the goal of cleaning
up the driver.  That has involved throwing out a number of features.  Some
of those needed to go - the original driver tries to track the resolution
of the screen, for example, which it has no business knowing.  Support for
the "twinview" approach to dual monitors has also been taken out.  In some
cases, the removed features are things that people want; support should
eventually be restored once it can be done in the right way.  Sometimes,
Peter said, things have to get worse before they can get better.
<p>
Also gone is the <a
href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/howto/wacomcpl">wacomcpl</a>
configuration tool.  It is, Peter said, some of the worst code that he has
ever seen.
<p>
Peter did this talk to update the graphics community on the state of
support for this driver, but he was also looking for input.  His attitude
toward development was described as "<q>if it doesn't crash the server,
it works</q>".  In other words, he is not a graphic artist, so he has no
deep understanding of how this hardware is used.  To get that
understanding, he needs input from 
the user community regarding development priorities and what does not work
as well as it should.
<p>
So artists making use of Wacom tablets should make sure that their needs
are known; the developer in charge of the driver is ready to listen.
Meanwhile, bringing a more open development process to the driver has
increased the pace of development and is improving the quality of the
code.  If the usual pattern holds, before long Linux should have support
for these tablets which is second to none.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Well... Although I personally never had real problems with using my tablet when developing Krita (I use OpenSUSE which has an admirable track record), there are always issues cropping up with wacom, the Qt tablet support and distributions. Sometimes the tablet buttons stop working, sometimes the stylus buttons stop working, sometimes there's no pressure, and sometimes there's weirdness with multi-monitor setup. Every upgrade, I Krita users come to me wailing that their tablet broke for one reason or the other. It's not just the driver, though, Qt's tablet support breaks every other version as well.

I'm confused. I use a wacom tablet (I'm not a graphic artist either - I use it instead of a mouse - I recommend trying it BTW), and I think the article got some things wrong - at least this part: "Surprisingly, the original vendor driver is still under development by Wacom".<br>
<p>
The wacom Linux programmer (Ping Chen) seems to be contributing to Peter's driver, and the old wacom driver is no longer developed  (last commit done 8 months ago): <a href="http://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linuxwacom/linuxwacom;a=shortlog">http://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=li...</a><br>

Correct, Ping contributes to the forked driver. In fact, all of Wacom's commits to the X driver so far come from Ping and given the number of commits that's actually quite an amount. It is fair to say that she's sacrificed a lot of her freetime for me to go at this development speed and I am very grateful for that.<br>
<p>
Kernel backports are still being developed in the linuxwacom and the input-wacom tarballs (the latter is kernel patches + xf86-input-wacom-&lt;newest&gt;).<br>
But Ping is also active pushing patches to upstream. Alas, this tends to take a backseat when it comes to pushing device support into linuxwacom/input-wacom backports for Wacom's customers. The Bamboos are the best example here, having support in the linuxwacom backports long before upstream got the patches. Funnily enough, IIRC both patchsets were written by community members which illustrates the need for a "kernel patches need to go to LKML" message.<br>
<p>
Re:development<br>
The last version announced on the lists is 0.8.8 in June 2010 which is later than the git repo for linuxwacom. I _think_ the git repo for linuxwacom was a once-off import that never actually replaced CVS but I can't prove that at this point since SF CVS is still offline. I do get irregular private emails from Ping where she mentions she is still working on linuxwacom, but tbh I've stopped checking linuxwacom's CVS a long time ago...<br>

The situation is actually worse on the other os. I have two wacom tablets. One a bamboo hobbyist tablet, the other one a intuous semi-pro tablet. They use two different drivers on win, and installing the pro driver on the same machine as the bamboo one makes the bamboo stop working properly (losing the pressure control, etc).<br>

Both Just Work on linux, hotplugging and mixing and matching.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 31, 2022</br>
           </div>
The Linux security module (LSM) mechanism was created as a result of the <a
href="/2001/features/KernelSummit/">first Kernel Summit</a> in 2001; it was
designed to allow the development of multiple approaches to Linux security.
That goal has been met; there are several security modules available with
current kernels.  The LSM subsystem was not designed, though, to allow
multiple security modules to work together on the same system.  Developers
have been working to rectify that problem almost since the LSM subsystem
was merged, but with limited success; some small security modules can be
stacked on top of the "major" ones, but arbitrary stacking is not possible.
Now, a full 20&nbsp;years after
security-module support went into the 2.5 development kernel series, it
looks like a solution to the stacking problem may finally be getting
closer.
<p>
<h4>The challenge</h4>
<p>
The early thinking was that an LSM would enforce a security policy on the
entire system, and that there would be only one of them.  The fact that the
only existing LSM for several years was SELinux helped to reinforce that
belief, but developers quickly realized that there could be good reasons to
run multiple LSMs on a system.  A proper stacking scheme would, for
example, make it possible to use a variety of small LSMs, each of which is
aimed at a piece of the security policy.  More recent developments, such as
containers, have increased the number of settings where even having
multiple full-system modules loaded might make sense.
<p>
There has been no shortage of attempts to solve this problem.  Some of
those that were covered here over the years include:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Serge Hallyn may have made <a href="/Articles/110432/">the first
     attempt</a> in 2004.
<li> <a href="/Articles/426921/">David Howells</a> in 2011.
<li> <a href="/Articles/518345/">Casey Schaufler</a> in 2012.
<li> <a href="/Articles/635771/">Schaufler again</a> in 2015.
<li> <a href="/Articles/804906/">Yet again</a> in 2019.
</ul>
<p>
Anybody who wants to solve this particular problem is going to have to face
a number of challenges.  One of those is deciding whether to allow an
operation if there are multiple active LSMs and they disagree with each
other.  The simplest approach there is to give any LSM veto power; all
modules that express an opinion on any specific operation must agree to
allow it, or it will be denied.  The hardest problems may well be
elsewhere.  Figuring out what the user-space interfaces should look like
when multiple LSMs are active is not straightforward; tracking down policy
problems can be painful even when there is only one module in the mix.
<p>
Another significant problem is giving LSMs the means to attach their own
metadata to objects in the system.  The original LSM patches handled this
by adding pointers to various kernel data structures, but no provision was
made for the problem of multiple modules needing to store data.  Any
solution has to allow LSMs to cooperate in this regard as well while, at
the same time, not having a measurable effect on performance.
<p>
<h4>A viable solution?</h4>
<p>
Schaufler does not lack for persistence; ten years after starting on this
project, he is still trying to get a solution for security-module stacking
that addresses these problems into the
mainline kernel.  <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20220927195421.14713-1-casey%40schaufler-ca.com/">Version&nbsp;38</a>
of his stacking patch set was posted in late September; it does not solve
the entire problem, but it does make it possible to stack the AppArmor LSM
with any other module.  After all those years and versions, it might not be
surprising to learn that Schaufler is ready to see this work merged; back
in August, he <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/791e13b5-bebd-12fc-53de-e9a86df23836@schaufler-ca.com/">asked</a>
whether that could happen during the 6.1 kernel cycle:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I would like very much to get v38 or v39 of the LSM stacking for
	Apparmor patch set in the LSM next branch for 6.1. The audit
	changes have polished up nicely and I believe that all comments on
	the integrity code have been addressed. The interface_lsm mechanism
	has been beaten to a frothy peak.
</blockquote>
<p>
This plan was complicated by an independent event, though: longtime LSM
maintainer James Morris <a 
href="/ml/linux-security-module/165731248606.335227.15503387932450699761.stgit@olly/">stepped
aside</a> and Paul Moore took over the maintainership of that subsystem.
This change arguably had both positive and negative effects with regard to
the stacking patches.  On the
positive side, Moore appears to have more time to engage with the stacking
patch set and a stronger desire to see it merged into the mainline.  Less
positive, at least with regard to a quick merging of the patches, is that
Moore <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhSF8hWg=7tbFiCrizNF61vpwJcU3793LcStiu-anW4i1g@mail.gmail.com/">felt
the need</a> to re-review the patch set from the beginning, which
inevitably led to comments and requests for changes.
<p>
Specifically, Moore was unhappy with the user-space API, which is an
extension of the existing, <tt>/proc</tt>-based interface that even
Schaufler described as "<q>hideous</q>".  Moore <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhTDGwO789t59EyOV0SwnwGrdyBhRiuJpoY7cB4MSe02BQ@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that perhaps the time had come to add a set of LSM-specific system calls
instead:
<P>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We have avoided this in the past for several reasons, but over the
	past couple of decades the LSMs have established themselves as a
	core part of Linux with many (all?) major Linux distributions
	shipping and supporting at least one LSM; I think we can justify a
	handful of well designed syscalls, and with Landlock we have some
	precedence too.
</blockquote>
<p>
Moore laid out a rough design for the system-call API that he had in mind
as well.  Schaufler was <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/e2b6ae44-1037-666f-5012-6abd4d46c0b7@schaufler-ca.com/">less
than pleased</a> with this idea, though:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I wish you'd suggested this three years ago, when I could have done
	something with it. If stacking has to go on a two year redesign
	because of this it is dead. We've spent years polishing the /proc
	interfaces.  Changed the names, the content, even bent over
	backwards to accommodate the security module that refused to adopt
	an attr/subdir strategy.
</blockquote>
<p>
User-space interfaces can be exceedingly difficult to change once they have
been included in a kernel release; if significant changes are required,
they usually need to happen before the code is merged.  So it is not
entirely surprising that Moore <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhQ+UcJw4G=VHNE8wMa+EBG-UcoZ7ox0vNqLHoSKAd9XZQ@mail.gmail.com/">was
insistent</a>, saying that he could not accept the proposed
interface; Schaufler eventually <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/9f79faa7-0d6a-c023-4561-15a261d4c60d@schaufler-ca.com/">threw
in the towel</a> and started discussing what he needed to do:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	OK, so what interfaces need to be redone? I have been polishing
	what's just become a turd for a %^&amp;*(ing long time. I need to
	know whether it is something I can address, or whether I just toss
	the entire thing in the proverbial bit bucket.
</blockquote>
<p>
<h4>The system-call API</h4>
<p>
Schaufler eventually came back with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221025184519.13231-1-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">a
proposal</a> for two new system calls.  The first of those is:
<p>
<pre>
    struct lsm_ctx {
	unsigned int		id;
	unsigned int		flags;
	__kernel_size_t		ctx_len;
	unsigned char		ctx[];
    };

    int lsm_self_attr(struct lsm_ctx *context, size_t *size, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>context</tt> is a buffer that is <tt>*size</tt> bytes in length; the
<tt>flags</tt> argument must be zero.
This call will return all of the attributes assigned to the calling process
by the security module(s) currently in force, in the buffer pointed to by
<tt>context</tt>;  <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221025184519.13231-7-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">this
patch</a> describes the format of the returned data.  The <tt>size</tt>
parameter will be updated with the actual size of the returned data.
The second system call can be used
to determine which LSMs are currently active:
<p>
<pre>
    int lsm_module_list(unsigned int *ids, size_t *size, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will fill the <tt>ids</tt> array with the ID numbers assigned to
each of the active modules.  These ID numbers are <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221025184519.13231-3-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">defined</a>
in a new header file that is intended to be a part of the user-space API;
Schaufler's Smack module, for example, is defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    #define LSM_ID_SMACK	34
</pre>
<p>
Much of this design follow Moore's initial suggestions.  It appears to be
mostly uncontroversial — with one significant exception.

Tetsuo Handa, a developer of the Tomoyo LSM, has vociferously and
repeatedly <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/a0567b10-fa83-50f4-7bf6-937e0c677e60@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/">objected</a>
to the use of integer module IDs assigned within the kernel code itself.
This practice will, he has argued, make it impossible to use run-time
loadable LSMs that are not currently part of the kernel source.  As a
result, it will be hard for developers of LSMs to test them or (especially)
get others to work with them.  That, in
turn, <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/ff43e254-0f41-3f4f-f04d-63b76bed2ccf@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/">spells</a>
a "<q>death sentence</q>" for any new LSMs in the future, he said.
<p>
As others have pointed out, there are a few problems with this argument,
starting with the fact that the kernel-development community has never gone
out of its way to make life easier for out-of-tree code.  Another is that
LSMs, whether in-tree or not, cannot be loaded at run time now.  That
capability was removed many years ago and
<a href="/Articles/526983/">seems unlikely to return</a>; among other
things, it is too easy for LSMs to 
bypass the restrictions normally applied to kernel modules.  For this
reason, Handa's request
to simply export the <tt>security_hook_heads</tt> variable to kernel modules is
unlikely to be viewed favorably.  Schaufler has also <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/cc14bbde-529e-376c-7d27-8512ec677db3@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>
repeatedly that any new mechanism for loadable LSMs would have to be treat
those modules quite differently than built-in LSMs, since loadable LSMs
would have to be
more severely restricted.  That is another big job that he personally has
no intention of taking on.
<p>
For all of these reasons, Handa's objections seem unlikely to prevail in
the end.  But this work, which has had such a turbulent history for so
long, may still not be merged immediately.  New system calls require
extensive review, and that process has just begun; it wouldn't be
surprising if more changes were called for.  Even so, the end of the
process for limited LSM stacking may be getting closer.  Then all that is
left is "universal stacking", a prospect that, <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/7d0feee1-a9e6-ac82-6962-89b17af025eb@schaufler-ca.com/">according
to Schaufler</a>, is "<q>at least a year off</q>".  There is visible
progress, but this lengthy discussion is not yet finished.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems like exposing per process information via sysfs may have been a good fit for LSM configuration?  While I'm loath to see expansion of proc interfaces, with my operator hat on I do have a strong preference for proc/sysfs over system calls as it makes it much easier to "discover" configuration.<br>

Some questions often missing from these discussions:<br>
<p>
- What are the use-cases for arbitrary stacking of AppArmor with SELinux or Smack (for example) ?<br>
- Do any such use-cases justify a large, invasive change to a core kernel security framework?<br>
- Will this improve Linux security, and Linux security usability?<br>
- Which distro or other major user will to commit to ship with all of this enabled in production, so that the code gets exercised at scale?<br>
- Will they commit to fixing any bugs found and help with long term upstream maintenance?<br>
- Is there consensus in the Linux kernel security community on any of these issues, and also the on the technical merit of all of the patches submitted?<br>
- Has all the code been reviewed by maintainers and experts in all of the subsystems impacted?<br>

AppArmor+Smack gives you the best of both path based ease-of-use and complete system MAC, without the overwhelming complexity of an SELinux policy. If you like the complexity of SELinux policy, use that instead of Smack. The "invasive" changes to the core framework are nothing more than parameter type changes. Allowing multiple security modules to have cred based attributes reduces the restrictions on what modules can work together. The single "major" module restriction prevents adding many useful additions. Ubuntu. They are already doing so. It's years since there has been an objection to stacking presented. I think that Yama put the "only one LSM at a time makes sense" argument down. It's not through lack of proposal, submission, notification and, in some cases, hounding.<br>

I tried to use Smack a couple of times and I failed to find anything that is simplified compared to SELinux.<br>
<p>
And both of them need the brain-dead "labeling".<br>

It also allows different frameworks to be used for different applications. Today, if you have an app that comes with selinux profiles and another with apparmor, you have a only use one LSM framework. This is starting to be a major "bummer" in the containerization world. <br>

So this means you need to support both AppArmor and SELinux at the same time in some meaningful way for the entire system. What does that policy look like and who is going to be able to support it?<br>

Yes, it does. <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lsseu2022/8c/2022-LSSEU-SmackReferencePolicy.pdf">https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lsseu2022/8c/2022-L...</a> <br>
Look at how much the SELinux reference policy has "evolved" over the past 20 years before demanding that the AppArmor and Smack policies be "complete" on day one.<br>

Yes, exactly, the major concern is maintenance of the security policy.  With my operator hat on, the ideal situation is that the policy configuration is provided by the upstream project. This means the policy only needs to be audited rather than written from scratch to work with the one LSM which is active on the system.<br>
<p>
A secondary concern is that the current situation requires a flag day change between LSMs, which is a high burden.<br>

Yes to a point, how much will depend on what you are trying to enable/support. f you are using AppArmor for application sandboxing instead of host level security it can make sense.<br>
<p>
For the case of a system LXD style container running Ubuntu on an SELinux host minimal support needed. AppArmor needs to be enabled in the kernel, the LSM stack needs to be setup and the container manager needs access to the AppArmor interfaces (this may require some policy changes). The container manager sets up an apparmor policy namespace and the container loads its policy into that namespace and it only affects that container.<br>
<p>
Application containers like Snap is doing can be made to work with minimal support like system style containers, but do need a little integration on the system for full confinement. In this use case AppArmor is only working to enforce container restrictions on the application, leaving host security to another LSM like SELinux.<br>
<p>
Setting up AppArmor with a full system host policy + SELinux I don't see as being useful.<br>

There is a parallel here to the RAID subthread [<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/912881/">https://lwn.net/Articles/912881/</a>], I think. To repurpose the words,<br>
<p>
The reality is that neither the user base nor commercial financial interest is present to add more detail in how local access is validated. Evidence of this is that practically $everyone is going in the direction of using virtualization/containers. (So like, less subdivision, more composition.) That container has a reduced fileset, and the task running inside is possibly the only UID in the container anyway, so Unix DAC is good enough.<br>

Virtualization technology has been around since the 1970's. It has yet to get past its overhead and resource sharing issues. Containers have much the same problem. Security models come and go. What made sense in 1985 seems bulky and somewhat silly in 2022. Do you remember Beowulf clusters? Grid computing? The cool kids aren't into "The Cloud", they've moved onto "The Edge". The primary reason for LSM stacking isn't to support the security paradigms of the past, but to enable and encourage those of today and tomorrow. That includes using existing modules in combinations to provide better protection then they would independently.<br>
<p>
So no, I don't think your parallel holds. There's no obsolete hardware involved, and even if $everone is going to virtualization/containers today (which I don't believe now any more than I believed it in 1980) they're going to go with something different in 2025.<br>

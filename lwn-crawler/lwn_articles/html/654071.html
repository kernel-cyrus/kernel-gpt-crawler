In <a href="/Articles/650299/">the July 9th edition</a>, Jonathan Corbet
said: "<q>Over time, the kernel development community has indeed
gotten better at merging code that does not require fixing later in the
development cycle.</q>"  That’s good. Now how do we accelerate this trend? One
need only look at the recent inclusion of <a
href="/Articles/608959/">kselftests</a> in the kernel or the 
ongoing development of the venerable <a
href="http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=xfs/cmds/xfstests.git;a=summary">xfstests</a>
suite to understand the 
current state of the art of Linux kernel test capabilities. However, what
becomes readily apparent when looking at these test suites is that they are
limited to tests that can be solely driven by user-space stimuli, such as
generic sysfs attributes, system calls, and on-disk metadata
formats.
<p>
Granted this is a very large test surface, but it still leaves a
coverage hole for a body of code that, to date, has only executed in the
presence of specific hardware (be it virtual or physical), makes up the
majority of the kernel source, and sees the highest rate of
change: device drivers. The <a href="/Articles/649840/">libnvdimm</a>
subsystem is one of the latest additions to the kernel's driver
infrastructure; it layers services over persistent memory to make access to
that memory safer and more reliable.  To the best of 
this author’s knowledge, libnvdimm is the first upstream device-driver
subsystem to 
integrate in-kernel interface mocking techniques in support of unit
testing. This article walks through how and why this came to pass, as well
as the challenge and promise of driver unit testing going forward.
<p>
<h4>The trouble with TRBs</h4>
<p>
While libnvdimm is the first upstream inclusion of this technique, the
first overall attempt to use mocking for driver development was part of
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=140872781311287&w=2">a patch
kit</a> for rearchitecting transfer-request-block (TRB) handling 
in the USB 3.0 host controller (XHCI) driver. It is helpful  to
understand the problem the patch kit was trying to solve to see why
mocking was proposed as a way to validate the implementation.
<p>
Like many I/O devices, XHCI controllers have a ring buffer for describing
transfers 
between memory and the device. An XHCI ring buffer entry is called a
TRB, and it describes a transfer of a contiguous range of memory. The
total set of TRBs in an XHCI ring need not be contiguous in memory as a
ring can be divided into segmented groups of TRBs. These individual ring
segments (TRB-segments) can be chained together with "link" TRBs. In the
case when a single TRB is only able to describe a subset of the full
transfer request  (i.e., when performing scatter-gather to multiple
discontiguous memory ranges), multiple TRBs can be ganged together to
form the transfer-descriptor (TD). This architecture is fairly
straightforward until one considers the pile of constraints imposed by
the I/O request, the host controller, and the attached device:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A TD may only cross a TRB-segment boundary (by way of a link-TRB) at a
device-defined boundary called the MBP (max burst payload). This means
that if the MBP is 1KB and we hit the end of a TRB segment after queuing a
512-byte TRB, things will fail; the driver should have instead enqueued an
early link-TRB rather than the 512-byte "transfer"-TRB.
<p>
<li> A single TRB may not cross a 64KB boundary in memory.
<p>
<li> Each discontiguous range to be transferred must have its own TRB
(implied since the driver is performing scatter-gather DMA in a TD).
</ul>
<p>
If you are still reading this article after that acronym soup then
perhaps you are also starting to imagine the array of USB peripherals
and contrived I/O scenarios needed to fully exercise all the corner-case
conditions presented by the these overlapping constraints. Instead,
these conditions can be explicitly tested by mocking all the interfaces
and input conditions that surround the TRB queuing implementation.
This is the approach taken in the patch titled "<a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=140872785411304&w=2">xhci: unit test ring 
enqueue/dequeue routines</a>". 
<p>
<h4>Move fast and break things</h4>

<p>
The motivation for exercising the XHCI TRB handling code with a unit
test was not driven solely by the complexities of the hardware
implementation. After all, the kernel has been quite successful in the
absence of widespread driver unit testing since its inception. However,
that success has come in part from shipping buggy code to users and
fixing it quickly when problems arise. Can this arrangement continue to
scale into the future?
<p>
While the number of new devices and platforms
increases and new developers join the kernel development community, the
number of active code reviewers remains relatively flat. A maintainer’s
most important job is to say "no" and when that "no" can be automated by
a robot like checkpatch, the 0day-kbuild infrastructure, or a unit test
suite, those limited reviewer resources can scale out to higher-order
review tasks. The power of unit tests to allow a project to scale was
made clear by this author’s time working at Facebook. The risk incurred
by onboarding new developers at a high rate was <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Facebook-Release-Process">mitigated
in part</a> 
by extensive unit tests. This discipline shifts the "break things"
aspect of "move fast" to the developer’s workstation rather than the
production environment.
<p>
<h4>From read-only to rewrite</h4>

<p>
The potential of unit testing to move bug detection earlier in the
development cycle is common knowledge. What was surprising during the
development of libnvdimm were the occasions where the process of
thinking through and developing a test resulted in early detection of
warts in the architecture. This happened several times in small ways;
early drafts of an approach that seemed suitable at first later
felt kludgy after writing the test, and these were ultimately thrown
away. A larger example was a reorganization of the
block-translation-table (BTT) implementation from a driver to a library.
<p>
First, here is a quick primer on the responsibilities of the BTT code.
Non-volatile memory devices provide persistent storage and can be used
anywhere a disk is used. Whereas disks perform I/O operations in units
of sectors (512-bytes for example) that are atomic with respect to power
loss, memory devices perform I/O in units of individual bytes.  With this
change comes an important question: what happens if a sector update is
interrupted (by a power failure, say) partway through?
<p>
Developers (and users) would like to see non-volatile devices be 
"atomic
with respect to power loss," meaning that a write to a sector completes in
full, or not at all, and software can depend on not seeing partially
updated sectors upon recovery from a crash or power failure event. The
BTT is a software mechanism to layer these atomic-sector-update
semantics on top of byte-accessible memory. The initial architecture for
BTT followed in the footsteps of other kernel drivers that layer various
storage semantics on top of another storage device. Device Mapper (DM -
volume management) and Multiple Devices (MD - RAID) use a stacked block
device arrangement for this purpose.
<p>
This stacked arrangement served the implementation well up until the
point where code was added to handle occasions when the backing memory
for a BTT is discovered to be read-only. The code gymnastics needed to
keep the block-device-read-only flags synchronized between the
"fronting" BTT block-device and the "backing" non-volatile memory
block-device received special attention during the upstream review cycle.
It became clear that the implementation would be cleaner with the
stacking removed and instead have the BTT built as an intrinsic property of
the storage device.
<p>
In the typical development model, sans unit tests,
the fact that the read-only flag for fronting and backing-device could
get out of sync may not have been caught until well after the kernel had
shipped to users. The process of developing a test highlighted the
hidden requirement, exposed a deficiency in the architecture, and
triggered significant reworking of the code, all in advance of the initial
merge of the libnvdimm subsystem into the v4.2-rc1 kernel.
<p>
<h4>Making a mockery</h4>

<p>
The unit-test infrastructure for libnvdimm lives in the
<tt>tools/testing/nvdimm</tt> directory. It compiles modified versions of the
nfit (the "firmware interface table" that enables discovery of persistent
memory arrays), libnvdimm core, and nvdimm storage drivers that consume mocked
resources for exercising the implementation.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/558106/">general method for 
inserting mock objects</a> into a C project is via the <tt>--wrap</tt> option
to the linker. In the kernel this is really only suitable for exported
symbols. See <tt>tools/testing/nvdimm/Kbuild</tt> for an example of providing
fake resources to the ACPI NFIT driver and the resulting child devices.
It is worth noting that <tt>--wrap</tt> should only ever appear in
<tt>Kbuild</tt> 
configurations for external (out-of-tree) modules — and testing modules
should always be considered out-of-tree, even when they are a part of the
kernel source. Beyond giving a visual
representation (a "taint" flag) in a kernel oops report that external
modules were loaded 
into the failing kernel, it also separates unit test implementations
that want to mock the same symbol in different ways.
<p>

Lastly, a successful unit test implementation should not render the
rest of the kernel inoperable.  For example, the libnvdimm test
modules provide a <tt>__wrap_ioremap()</tt> symbol that redirects requests to
mock memory resources for test purposes.  However, if that routine is
handed a real libnvdimm resource, <tt>__wrap_ioremap()</tt> detects it
and passes it through to the actual <tt>ioremap()</tt> in the base kernel.
<p>
I struggled with the kernel build infrastructure to use the
linker-provided method for calling "real" symbols from a wrapper.  The
linker defines a <tt>__real_ioremap()</tt> by default for this purpose, but
that symbol cannot be handed to EXPORT_SYMBOL(). Instead, the Kbuild
infrastructure can achieve the same effect as
<tt>__real_&lt;symbol&gt;()</tt> by 
placing the definition of the wrappers in their own directory.  See
<tt>tools/testing/nvdimm/test/iomap.c</tt> 
for the implementation of the fallback mechanism.
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
The addition of the unit tests was a contentious point during the review
process — a fact that is reflected in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/tools/testing/nvdimm?id=6bc756193ff6">the
changelog</a>. Although there were numerous, pleasantly
surprising occasions of early detection of bugs and architecture defects,
this approach carries risk. Mock objects by definition take shortcuts
and bend the normal rules of the objects they replace. This fact
presents a unique maintenance burden in that different test
implementations may choose to mock the same symbol in different ways —
ways that would be surprising to a typical kernel developer.
<p>
In general,
code aspects in a project that surprise a typical developer are a tax on
review resources. That said, the "tax" is overshadowed by the benefits.
The volume and pace of iteration needed to take libnvdimm, without
regressing, from its initial posting at v4.1-rc1 to its final merging
state at v4.2-rc1 could not have been achieved without this capability.
As the kernel continues to scale and attract new developers, the need
for automated code review and testing will continue to grow.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I am very much a beginner at this sort of thing, but my best results have been when I did not try to mock interfaces not designed for it (which I have done before), but designed the code to be tested to be modular enough to plug into either the real external interface (hardware or whatever) or a testing interface.  I have also occasionally even committed the sin of basically embedding unit tests into production code, to be executed every time the real code is (or at least every time it is initialised) - BIOS POST-style.  Very dubious as I am the first to admit, but it can actually make for more understandable, or at lest less surprising code if done right.<br>

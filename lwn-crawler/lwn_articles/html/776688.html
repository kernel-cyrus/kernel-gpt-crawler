<p>Hardware memory encryption is, or will soon be, available on multiple
generic CPUs.  In its absence, data is stored — and passes between the
memory chips and the processor — in the clear. Attackers may be able to
access it by using hardware probes or by directly accessing the chips, which is
especially problematic with persistent memory. One  new memory-encryption
offering is Intel's <a
href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/a5/16/Multi-Key-Total-Memory-Encryption-Spec.pdf">Multi-Key
Total Memory Encryption (MKTME) [PDF]</a>; AMD's equivalent is called <a
href="https://developer.amd.com/sev/">Secure Encrypted Virtualization
(SEV)</a>. The implementation of support for this
feature is in progress for the Linux kernel. Recently, Alison Schofield <a
href="/Articles/773972/">proposed a user-space API</a> for MKTME, provoking
a long discussion on how memory encryption should be
exposed to the user, if at all.</p>

<p>Filesystem encryption options offer a wide choice of possibilities;
their use is now standard practice in a number of settings,
protecting user data when it is at
rest. On the other hand, data stored in main memory is kept in the clear,
as are exchanges between memory chips and the
processors.

In a virtualized environment, if attackers can
find a way to read memory from neighbor virtual machines, they can access
the data from those machines.
Physical attacks are possible by removing memory chips or spying
on the memory buses. This is becoming a more serious threat with
persistent-memory technologies, where the data stays in the clear even
after power is removed. Memory-encryption technologies
are aiming to address some of those attacks.</p>

<p>Memory encryption has been available in Intel chips for some time
in the form of <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/tme">Total
Memory Encryption (TME)</a>. It uses a
single, CPU-generated key for all of memory; users can control the usage
of TME in the boot-level firmware. A new standard, which will be available
in upcoming 
chips, is MKTME, an extension of TME that supports
different encryption settings  (including disabling
encryption) at the page level, and more keys. Different keys can be used at
the same time for 
different memory regions. The main
use case for MKTME seems to be adding more protection in systems with
multiple virtual machines (see <a
href="https://schd.ws/hosted_files/lc32018/38/mktme_lc3_2018.pdf">these
slides from
LinuxCon China [PDF]</a>). The encryption algorithm supported is AES-XTS
128 with the
physical address being taken into account as a type of nonce.</p>

<p>Lower-level support for MKTME in the Linux kernel was <a
href="/Articles/764480/">submitted</a> in September
2018. Memory encryption was also one of the subjects <a
href="/Articles/752683/">discussed</a> at the 2018 Linux Storage,  
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit. The recent <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/cover.1543903910.git.alison.schofield@intel.com/">patch
set</a> from Schofield goes further, adding the user interface to set up the
encryption and (optionally) keys, assign key identifiers to memory regions;
the patch set also adds a key store to support CPU hotplug.</p>

<h4>encrypt_mprotect()</h4>

<p>Setting up MKTME requires a few steps: create a key, map a region of
anonymous memory, and enable the encryption. The key is created and added
to the kernel keyring using the <tt>add_key()</tt> helper function from the
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyutils.7.html"><tt>keyutils</tt>
library</a>. It requires the key type and key material (if the key is not to
be generated by the CPU) 
and additional, specific options. Then the user should map a region of
anonymous memory with <tt>mmap()</tt>, then use a new system call to enable
protection.</p>

<p>That new system call is <tt>encrypt_mprotect()</tt>. It
takes the same parameters as <tt>mprotect()</tt> with addition of a key
serial number. The prototype is:</p>
<pre>
    int encrypt_mprotect(unsigned long start, size_t len,
                         unsigned long prot, key_serial_t serial);
</pre>

<p>An <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/c2276bbbb19f3a28bd37c3dd6b1021e2d9a10916.1543903910.git.alison.schofield@intel.com/">example</a>
showing the use of the new system call was submitted with the patch set.</p>

<h4>API alternatives, key changes and cache state</h4>

<p>Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CALCETrUqqQiHR_LJoKB2JE6hCZ-e7LiFprEhmo-qoegDZJ9uYQ@mail.gmail.com/">expressed
a number of objections</a> to the API in its proposed form. The first point
was about the new system call, which he described as "<q>an incomplete
version of <tt>mprotect()</tt></q>" due to its lack of support for <a
href="/Articles/689395/">memory protection keys</a>.
Its only function is to change the
encryption key while, he said, the most secure usage is to stick with the
CPU-generated key.

<p> He also had doubts about the safety of swapping encrypted memory.
The kernel's direct-mapping area, which maps all of physical memory
directly into the kernel's address space, can also be the source of
cache-coherency issues.  Problems
could arise because the user's mapping and the kernel's direct mapping will
have different keys for the same memory, so data corruption may occur. He
doubted that MKTME should be used with anonymous memory (memory not backed
up by a file or a device).  As a solution, he proposed a different
approach: instead of a generic API, there should be specific interfaces for
persistent memory and virtual-machine hardening.</p>

<p>Dave Hansen <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/c610138f-32dd-a24c-dc52-4e0006a21409@intel.com/">responded</a>,
explaining the logic behind the API proposal. The goal of adding the new
system call was to allow it to stack with the generic <tt>mprotect()</tt>
and <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pkey_mprotect.2.html"><tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt></a>,
rather than replacing those other calls.  The cache-coherency issues are
expected to be avoided by careful reference counting in the VMAs before
issuing the <tt>PCONFIG</tt> instruction that changes the key. He also
promised to find out why the user-provided keys had been included.</p>

<p>Dan Williams <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAPcyv4gg5ymssw75q9k8NwwPrstDUrqmCEeU_VNU=rKEM7izGg@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a> that the persistent-memory code only needs to access the encrypted
version of the data, so it never uses the direct mapping and can safely
move blocks without considering the keys.</p>

Further in the discussion Hansen <a href="/ml/linux-security-module/7ac80308-1831-fe42-9c53-05f913cba403@intel.com/">noted</a>
that the persistent-memory use case, which requires a user-supplied key, is
reasonable, but it is not covered by the 
current patch set; he proposed to postpone it until that part is done. 
Other developers, like Jarkko Sakkinen also <a href="/ml/linux-security-module/10b900d7461d81433120e614287d6f837cea83ef.camel@intel.com/">asked
questions</a>, including about what happens if a key changes suddenly.
The answer 
is that it might result in data corruption if the right cache flushes are
missing. The discussion ended for now without a clear conclusion on either
the API or the main use case for this feature.</p>

<h4>User keys and CPU hotplug</h4>

<p>The MKTME code tries not to save any key material longer than needed, so
the kernel destroys user-supplied key data once the hardware has been
programmed. That leads to a potential problem, though: the kernel will need
those keys if a new CPU comes online.  This problem was solved by
setting up an optional storage for key data in kernel memory. When the
<tt>mktme_savekeys</tt> kernel command line option is enabled, the code
uses this store. Otherwise, new CPUs are not allowed if any user-supplied
keys are in use.</p>

<p>The saving of encryption keys caused questions; Kai Huang <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/1544148839.28511.28.camel@intel.com/">asked 
if CPU-hotplug support is that important</a> as storing the keys can make
them susceptible to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot attacks</a>.
He noted that there are configurations where the
kernel does not support CPU hotplug, and suggested that a per-socket key ID
may be a solution. Kirill Shutemov <a href="/ml/linux-security-module/20181207114709.kmrbghihyrht2l65@kshutemo-mobl1/">didn't
like the idea</a>, as it would add complexity in the MKTME code that
would need to keep track of nodes.  It would also complicate memory management,
especially in the case of memory migration. The solution has not been yet
found; the next version of the patch will have
to try to resolve the issue.</p>

<h4>The security model for virtual-machine isolation</h4>

<p>There have been multiple discussions around the security model of 
MKTME and how the feature is expected to be used, especially in 
comparison with TME. The developers concentrated on various exploits and
malicious code that might try to override the protection.</p>

<p>Lutomirski noted that MKTME <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CALCETrXsh6wAy9kE_m1L+0yW8a6bNOb6g2Tf9nwpQJnyMzdSuw@mail.gmail.com/">does
not protect</a> against malicious accesses between virtual machines, as the
memory controller does not know where any given access comes from. 
Sakkinen agreed; he <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/a19a48ae1d6434a1764b02c2376a99130ce15174.camel@intel.com/">does
not see</a> TME making virtual-machine isolation any better. Hansen <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/986544e1-ffd1-1cd2-f0d3-4b1a4e8e8f3b@intel.com/">responded</a>
that MKTME does not provide protection when the attacking code can execute
code inside the hypervisor.  Also, when the kernel keeps non-encrypted
mappings of memory that also has encrypted mappings, the attacker may be
able to read the memory via the non-encrypted mappings.  To avoid those
problems,
Lutomirski is proposing to reuse the <a href="/Articles/700647/">exclusive
page-frame ownership</a> mechanism so that the direct
mapping page is removed when memory is allocated for user space.</p>

<p>The <a href="/ml/linux-security-module/655394650664715c39ef242689fbc8af726f09c3.camel@intel.com/">discussion
on the security model</a> covered both virtual machines and CPUs.
Interested readers may also refer to a <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09604.pdf">a research paper [PDF]</a> on SEV  
subversion.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>The addition of MKTME support provoked a number of different
opinions on how to support the feature. A consensus has not been reached
yet and the final implementation may turn out to be different than what has
been proposed so far. The discussion shows how difficult it is sometimes to
create a good API. The main work the
developers have to do now is to understand the use cases better and agree
on an interface that will cover those needs. We are likely going to see
more iterations of this patch and more discussion in the near future.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder how widespread the use of CPU hotplugging is, especially on bare metal. I've always seen it as a rather obscure use case that perhaps occasionally used in mainframes or something.  If that's the case, one could simply say that at first memory encryption is not supported when cpu hotplugging is enabled.<br>

But perhaps my idea of the popularity of the cpu hotplugging functionality is wrong?<br>

The encryption hardware discussed in this article is integrated into the memory controller(s). So it only affects data as it leaves the coherent bus and heads out to off-chip memory (typically DRAM). This serves two purposes. <br>
<p>
1.  No plaintext on the DDR bus. Though I’d argue if a black hat has physical access to your DDR bus you have bigger problems ;-). <br>
<p>
2. Assuming different keys for each process (or VM) leaking memory from one process to another does not reveal user data. <br>
<p>
For inter-SMP buses only 1 is an issue. So I’d argue it’s less critical to encrypt the chip to chip busses than the chip to memory busses. Now I’d argue this holds less and less as these busses scale out so things like OpenGenCCIX might need encryption...<br>

      The Real World Tech forums <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=182253&curpostid=182253">debated inter-socket encryption last month</a>.<p>
As usual with forums, it's difficult to ensure posters are who they say they are, but someone calling himself Aaron Spink <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=182253&curpostid=182267"> said</a>:<blockquote>
The simple reality is that you aren't going to MitM any high speed link without a custom board and multiple millions of dollars of large bulky equipment. You can't just put some contacts onto the board and get a viable working signal.</blockquote><a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=182253&curpostid=182282">and</a><blockquote>AFAIK, no one actually does link level encryption in the field currently for a variety of reasons (not the least of which is that end to end is much simpler and robust).
</blockquote>
<p>
Presumably, the point is that modern point-to-point high speed connections are designed to run as fast as possible over as few wires as possible. A third device on the link would change the electrical characteristics to the point that the link just wouldn't work -- if it didn't, the link isn't going fast enough.

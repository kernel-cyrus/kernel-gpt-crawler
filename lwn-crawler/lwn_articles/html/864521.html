<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 30, 2021</br>
           </div>
The C programming language is famously prone to memory-safety problems
that lead to buffer overflows and a seemingly endless stream of security
vulnerabilities.  But, even in&nbsp;C, it is possible to improve the
situation in many cases.  One of those is the <tt>memcpy()</tt> family of
functions, which are used to efficiently copy or overwrite blocks of
memory; with a bit of help from the compiler, those functions can be
prevented from writing past the end of the
destination object they are passed.  Enforcing that condition in the kernel
is harder than one might expect, though, as <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727205855.411487-1-keescook@chromium.org/">this
massive patch set</a> from Kees Cook shows.
<p>
Buffer overflows never seem to go away, and they are a constant source of 
bugs and security problems in the 
kernel.  That said, hardening techniques have become good enough that many
types of stack-based overflows can be detected and defended against (by
killing the system if nothing else).  It is hard to overwrite the stack
without running over boundaries (which may contain a canary value) in ways
that make the problem evident.  Heap-based data lacks such boundaries,
though, making overflows in the heap space harder to detect; as a result,
attackers tend to find such vulnerabilities attractive.
<p>
<h4>Fortifying the source</h4>
<p>
The kernel's <tt>FORTIFY_SOURCE</tt> configuration option turns on a range
of checks for functions that are commonly implicated in memory problems in
the heap area (and beyond).
The <tt>strcpy()</tt> family of functions, for example, is fairly
thoroughly checked when this option is turned on.  There are also checks
for <tt>memcpy()</tt> and friends; consider the fortified version of
<tt>memset()</tt> from <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/include/linux/fortify-string.h">include/linux/fortify-string.h</a>
which, in current kernels, looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    __FORTIFY_INLINE void *memset(void *p, int c, __kernel_size_t size)
    {
	size_t p_size = __builtin_object_size(p, 0);

	if (__builtin_constant_p(size) &amp;&amp; p_size &lt; size)
	    __write_overflow();
	if (p_size &lt; size)
	    fortify_panic(__func__);
	return __underlying_memset(p, c, size);
    }
</pre>
<p>

This version asks the compiler for the size of the destination object
(<tt>p</tt>).  If the passed-in <tt>size</tt> is known at compile time (the
<tt>__builtin_constant_p()</tt> test is true), then the test can be made
right away, causing compilation to fail if an overflow is detected;
otherwise the second <tt>if</tt> test performs the check at run time.  Note
that the run-time test will 
be optimized out by the compiler in cases where the size is known to be
within bounds.
<p>
So it would seem that the kernel already has bounds checking for these
functions, but there's a catch.  The second argument to
<tt>__builtin_object_size()</tt> describes <i>which</i> object is of
interest.  This comes into play when, for example, the object of interest
is embedded within a structure.  If that second argument is zero (as in the
example above), the return size is the number of bytes to the end of the
containing structure; setting that argument to one, instead, gives only the
size of the immediate object itself.  See <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Object-Size-Checking.html">the GCC
documentation</a> for more information on <tt>__builtin_object_size()</tt>.
<p>
The end result is that the version of <tt>memset()</tt> shown above will
catch attempts to write beyond the end of a structure, but will not catch
overflows that overwrite structure fields after the intended destination.  That
leaves a lot of interesting fields for an attacker to step on if they can
find a way to influence the size passed into those functions.  One might
think that the obvious thing to do is to change the second argument to
<tt>__builtin_object_size()</tt> to one, thus checking against the correct
size, but this is the kernel and life is not so simple.
<p>
Setting or copying data across multiple structure fields is, as it turns
out, a fairly common action in the kernel, and those actions would trigger
more strict tests in the memory functions.  The result of enabling the
strict tests would be an unbuildable, unusable kernel; that would certainly
be secure, but users would still be unimpressed.  Users can be a little
funny that way.
<p>
<h4><tt>memset_after()</tt></h4>
<p>
One common use case for copying across fields is the "write zeroes from here
to the end of the structure" operation.  Consider, for example, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c#L280">this
code</a> in the AR9170 wireless network driver:
<p>
<pre>
    memset(&amp;txinfo-&gt;status.ack_signal, 0,
	   sizeof(struct ieee80211_tx_info) -
	   offsetof(struct ieee80211_tx_info, status.ack_signal));
</pre>
<p>
This code shows a case of clearing to the end of the structure; it also
shows just how awkward such code can be.  That sort of length arithmetic is
easy to get wrong, and it's subject to disruption if the layout of the
structure changes for any reason.  Indeed, the line of code <i>before</i>
the above reads:
<p>
<pre>
    	BUILD_BUG_ON(offsetof(struct ieee80211_tx_info, status.ack_signal) != 20);
</pre>
<p>
This test will cause a build failure if the offset of the first field to
overwrite is not as expected, but will not catch any changes made after
that field.  Structure members added after <tt>ack_signal</tt> will be
overwritten by this <tt>memset()</tt> call — a fact that may not be obvious
at the time.
<p>
To clarify this sort of code and to avoid false positives from stricter
checks on <tt>memset()</tt>, the patch set <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727205855.411487-38-keescook@chromium.org/">introduces
a new macro</a> for this operation:
<p>
<pre>
    memset_after(object, value, member);
</pre>
<p>
It will cause every byte of <tt>object</tt> located after <tt>member</tt> to
be set to <tt>value</tt>.  This macro can replace the above code with:
<p>
<pre>
    memset_after(&amp;txinfo-&gt;status, 0, rates);
</pre>
<p>
(The <tt>ack_signal</tt> field, being the first to be zeroed, is
immediately after <tt>rates</tt> in this structure).  
Numerous such cases have been fixed in Cook's patch set.
<p>
<h4>Grouped structure fields</h4>
<p>
There is a more complicated case, though, in which a range of fields within
a structure is overwritten in a single call.  A number of approaches have
been used within the kernel to try to do such copies safely; one of those
is the same sort of <tt>offsetof()</tt> arithmetic seen in the case above.
But there are others.  <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/include/linux/skbuff.h#L798">Deep
within the <tt>sk_buff</tt> structure</a> used to represent network packets
is this field:
<p>
<pre>
    __u32 headers_start[0];
</pre>
<p>
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/include/linux/skbuff.h#L918">A
full 120 lines later</a> is another zero-length array called
<tt>headers_end</tt>.  Those arrays clearly cannot hold any data of
interest; instead, they are used with the same sort of offset arithmetic to
copy a whole set of packet headers in a single operation.  Here, too, there
is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/net/core/skbuff.c#L974">a
set of build-time checks</a> to ensure that, at least, all of the relevant
header fields are located between the two markers.
<p>
Some developers simply add up the lengths of the fields to be written and
use the result as the length for the memory operation.
Yet another approach is to define a nested structure to hold the set of
fields to be copied.  This variant is safer, but it complicates the use of
those fields (which must be accessed by way of the intermediate structure)
and tends to lead to pollution of the namespace with macros added to
minimize those complications.
<p>
In summary, kernel developers have come up
with a number of ways of handling cross-field memory operations, but none
of them are particularly satisfying.
Cook's patch set brings a new solution (co-authored with Keith Packard) in
the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727205855.411487-5-keescook@chromium.org/">the
<tt>struct_group()</tt> macro</a>.  Taking the example from that patch,
consider a structure like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct foo {
	int one;
	int two;
	int three;
	int four;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Imagine further that the developer wants to copy over fields <tt>two</tt> and
<tt>three</tt> with a single <tt>memcpy()</tt> call.  This could be formalized
by declaring the structure this way:
<p>
<pre>
    struct foo {
	int one;
	struct_group(thing,
		     int two,
		     int three,
	);
	int four;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This macro has the effect of creating a nested structure called
<tt>thing</tt>, which can be used with functions like <tt>memcpy()</tt>
with the strict bounds checks enabled.  The individual fields can still be
referred to as <tt>two</tt> and <tt>three</tt>, though, without the need to
name the nested structure, and without any macro ugliness.  This is
accomplished this way:
<p>
<pre>
    #define struct_group_attr(NAME, ATTRS, MEMBERS) \
	union { \
	    struct { MEMBERS } ATTRS; \
	    struct { MEMBERS } ATTRS NAME; \
	}

    #define struct_group(NAME, MEMBERS)	\
	struct_group_attr(NAME, /* no attrs */, MEMBERS)
</pre>
<p>

This macro defines an intermediate structure to hold the grouped fields —
twice; one is anonymous while the other has the given <tt>NAME</tt>.  The
duplicated structures are then overlaid on top of each other within an
anonymous union.  This bit of trickery  makes it possible to use the field
names directly while also 
providing the name for the structure as a whole, which can be used with the
memory functions.
<p>
<h4>Toward a harder kernel</h4>
<p>
Much of the patch set is devoted to defining these groups within structures
throughout the kernel, then using the groups for memory operations.  With
that done, it becomes possible to enable the stricter bounds checks for
those operations — sort of.  The remaining problem is that this kind of
cross-field operation is actually kind of hard to find in the code; there
is not a pattern that can be easily grepped for.  Chances are thus good
that there are other occurrences in the kernel that have not been found
yet; as Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727205855.411487-35-keescook@chromium.org/">noted</a>
halfway through the patch series, there are over 25,000 <tt>memcpy()</tt>
calls in the kernel.  Crashing the system in response to an unfixed (but
correct)
cross-field operation would be seen as rude at best, so warnings will have
to be issued instead for the indefinite future.
<p>
There should come a time, though, when reports of warnings fall off and the
community will feel confident enough to halt the system when an
out-of-bounds copy is detected.  The value of doing so could be
significant.  Quoting the just-linked patch:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	With this it's also possible to compare the places where the known
	11 memcpy() flaw overflows happened against the resulting list of
	potential new bounds checks, as a measure of potential efficacy of
	the tightened mitigation. Much to my surprise, horror, and delight,
	all 11 flaws would have been detected by the newly added run-time
	bounds checks, making this a distinctly clear mitigation
	improvement.
</blockquote>
<p>
This mitigation seems worth having, but first the patches must find their
way into the mainline kernel.  Security-related work often has a rough path
into the kernel, though the situation has gotten better over the years.  In
this case, at least, one frequent complaint (impact on performance) should
not be an issue; the cost of an extra length check in the cases where the
answer isn't known at compile time is tiny.  But the patch set is still
large and wide-ranging; chances are that there will be some discussions to
get through before it can be merged.  The completion of that process should
herald the end of another type of unpleasant security bugs.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Explicit field copies. More to type, but no running afoul of new members added to S. gcc-11.1.1 -O3 is capable to produce the same x86_64 asm as a field-insensitive memcpy(d,s,sizeof(*s)) would on -O2.<br>

i don&#x27;t understand what &quot;running afoul of new members added to S&quot; means anyways. it seems to me that in the vast majority of cases, when new members are added, one would want them to be copied too. otherwise, write memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(*dest) - offsetof(struct S, last_member) + sizeof(dest-&gt;last_member))?<br>

replacing that with a pure memset (yes I know that your example didn&#x27;t clear all the members, but still) resulted in even less code.<br>

Yes, it will also optimize for uint8_t. You just need enough bytes overall (looks like &gt;= 8) to make it worthwhile for gcc to switch to SIMD-based copying.<br>
For bitfields there is a bit of a problem, for which I filed <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101705">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101705</a> .<br>

Of course, the kernel disables SIMD so that it doesn&#x27;t use the XMM/YMM registers, and thus they don&#x27;t have to be saved/restored at system call time.<br>

Isn&#x27;t that just for static structures full of function pointers (basically vtables)? Presumably `sk_buff` structures and other such things being `memcpy`&#x27;d to are not constant once the kernel is booted.<br>

Right, and if any __randomize_layout struct wanted to use struct_group() it could as those would be kept together. It actually makes things easier.<br>

BOS works much better in clang than gcc. I implemented those tricks in my str*/mem* variants, and clang could detect much more compile-time sizes, and it has diagnose_if to throw the same compile-time warnings as the runtime libc.<br>

      In the linked file perf_memcpy_s.c, I saw uniform weighting of chunks that are all multiples of 1 KiB.  What happens for a model that is closer to actual usage in the Linux kernel?  The kernel has obvious special cases for filesystems, network stack, and general management of pages; but what about the rest?  Measuring the task of re-compiling and re-building the kernel under the configurations "all module" and "all yes" are two interesting cases.
<p>
In user space, a very large portion of allocations by malloc() are for 100 bytes or fewer, which constrains memcpy to "small" lengths on average.  See <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.net/2016/ocw//system/presentations/3921/original/LPC%202016%20-%20linux%20and%20glibc_%20The%204.5TiB%20malloc%20API%20trace.pdf">http://www.linuxplumbersconf.net/2016/ocw//system/presentations/3921/original/LPC%202016%20-%20linux%20and%20glibc_%20The%204.5TiB%20malloc%20API%20trace.pdf</a>.

Interestingly that struct group macro is essentially recreating part of gcc&#x27;s plan9-extensions (presumably they can from plan9). I will admit that using a typedef as the indication of &quot;I want the member name and the anon-struct behavior&quot; is pretty odd. Also it turns on other stuff (like the object oriented implicit pointer casts).<br>

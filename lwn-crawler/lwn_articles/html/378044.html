           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 10, 2010</br>

The POSIX approach to realtime scheduling is based on priorities: the
highest-priority task gets the CPU.  The research community has long since
moved on from priorities, though, and has been putting a lot of effort into deadline
scheduling instead.  Deadline schedulers allow each process to provide a
"worst case execution time" and the deadline by which it must get that
time; it can then schedule all tasks so that they meet their deadlines while
refusing  tasks which would cause that promise to be broken.  There
are a few deadline scheduler patches in circulation, but the
<tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt> patch by Dario Faggioli and friends looks like the
most likely one to make it into the mainline at this time; LWN <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/356576/">looked at this patch</a> back in
October.
<p>
Recently, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/376502/">version 2 of the
<tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt> patch</a> was posted.  The changes reflect a number
of comments which were made the first time around; among other things,
there is a new implementation of the group scheduling mechanism.  Perhaps
most significant in this patch, though, is an early attempt at addressing
priority inversion problems, where a low-priority process can, by holding
shared resources, prevent a higher-priority process from running.  Priority
inversion is a hard problem, and, in the deadline scheduling area, it
remains without a definitive solution.
<p>
In classic realtime scheduling, priority inversion is usually addressed by
raising the priority of a process which is holding a resource required by a
higher-priority process.  But there are no priorities in deadline
scheduling, so a variant of this approach is required.  The new patch works
by "deadline inheritance" - if a process holds a resource required by
another process which has a tighter deadline, the holding process has its
deadline shortened until the resource is released.  It is also necessary to
exempt the process from bandwidth throttling (exclusion from the CPU when
the stated execution time is exceeded) during this time.  That, in turn,
could lead to the CPU being oversubscribed - something deadline schedulers
are supposed to prevent - but the size of the problem is expected to be
small.
<p>
The "to do" list for this patch still has a number of entries, including
less disruptive bandwidth throttling, a port to the realtime preemption
tree, truly global deadline scheduling on multiprocessor systems (another hard
problem), and more.  The code is progressing, though, and Linux can be
expected to have a proper deadline scheduler at some point in the
not-too-distant future - though no deadline can be given as the worst case
development time is still unknown.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yeah, and it is even worse since I am not (i.e., I would like very much to but I can't) working it full-time! :-P<br>

First of all, from me and all the other guys working hard on SCHED_DEADLINE, thanks to our Editor for his interest in our 'baby'! :-D<br>
<p>
If this is allowed, just a couple of things and links:<br>
* "a port to the realtime preemption tree"<br>
  This has been done, and its available at:<br>
   git://gitorious.org/sched_deadline/rt-deadline.git sched-dl<br>
<p>
* "including less disruptive bandwidth throttling"<br>
  This has been already done as well, and it is again available in project's<br>
  repos:<br>
  git://gitorious.org/sched_deadline/linux-deadline.git sched-dl<br>
  git://gitorious.org/sched_deadline/rt-deadline.git sched-dl<br>
<p>
where "sched-dl" is the name of the branch.<br>
<p>
Thanks a lot again,<br>
Dario<br>

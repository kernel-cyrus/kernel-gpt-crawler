<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 18, 2014</br>
           </div>
"Volatile ranges" is a name given to regions of user-space memory that can
be reclaimed by the kernel when memory is tight.  The classic use case is
for a web browser's image cache; the browser would like to keep that
information in memory to speed future page loads, but it can do without
that data should the memory used for the cache be needed elsewhere.
Implementations of the volatile range concept have experienced more than
the usual amount of change; that rate of change may well continue into the
future — if a developer can be found to continue the work.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/468896/">Early versions</a> of the patch set were based
on the <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> system call.  Some developers complained
that it was more of an allocation-related concept, so the patch was <a
href="/Articles/500382/">reworked</a> to use <tt>fallocate()</tt> instead.
By 2013, the plan <a href="/Articles/548111/">had shifted</a> toward the
addition of two new system calls named <tt>fvrange()</tt> and
<tt>mvrange()</tt>.  <a href="/Articles/590991/">Version&nbsp;11</a>,
released in March 2014, moved to a single system call named
<tt>vrange()</tt>.  During all of these iterations, there have also been
concerns about user-space semantics (what happens when a process tries to
access a page that has been purged, in particular) and the best way to
implement volatile ranges internally.  So nothing has ever been merged into
the mainline kernel.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/596770/">Version 14</a>, posted by John Stultz on
April&nbsp;29, changes the user-space API yet again.  Volatile ranges have
now shifted to the <tt>madvise()</tt> system call.  In particular, a call
to:
<p>
<pre>
    madvise(address, length, MADV_VOLATILE);
</pre>
<p>
Will mark the memory range of <tt>length</tt> bytes starting at
<tt>address</tt> as being volatile.  Once the memory range has been marked
in this way, the kernel is free to reclaim the associated pages and discard
their contents at any time.  Should the application need access to the
range in the future, it should mark it as being nonvolatile with:
<p>
<pre>
    madvise(address, length, MADV_NONVOLATILE);
</pre>
<p>
The return value is zero for success (the range is now nonvolatile and the
previous contents remain intact), a negative number if some sort of error
occurred, or one if the operation was successful but at least one of the
pages has been purged.
<p>
The use of <tt>madvise()</tt> had been considered in the past; it makes
sense, given that the purpose is to advise the kernel about the importance
of a particular range of memory.  Previous volatile range implementations,
though, had the property that marking a range nonvolatile could fail
partway through.  That meant that the interface had to be able to return
two values: (1)&nbsp;how many pages had been successfully marked, and
(2)&nbsp;whether any of
them had been purged.  This time around, John found a way to make the
operation atomic, in that it either succeeds or fails as a whole.  In the
absence of a need for a second return value, the <tt>madvise()</tt>
interface is adequate for the task.
<p>
What happens if user space attempts to access a volatile page that has been
purged by the kernel?  This implementation will deliver a SIGBUS signal in
that situation.  A properly-equipped application can catch the signal and
respond by obtaining the needed data from some other source; applications
that are not prepared will litter the disk with unsightly core dumps
instead.  That may seem like an unfriendly response, but one can argue that
an application should not be trying to directly access memory that,
according to instructions it gave to the kernel, does not actually need to
be kept around.
<p>
Minchan Kim <a href="/Articles/602662/">does not like</a> this
approach; he would prefer, instead, that the application simply receive a
new, zero-filled page in this situation.

He is, it turns out, thinking about a slightly different use case:
code that reuses memory and wants to tell the kernel that the old contents
need not be preserved.  In this case, the reuse should be as low-overhead
as possible; Minchan would prefer to have no need for either an
<tt>MADV_NONVOLATILE</tt> call or a SIGBUS signal handler.  John <a
href="/Articles/602663/">suggested</a> that Minchan's own <a
href="/Articles/590991/"><tt>MADV_FREE</tt> patch</a> was better suited to
that use case, but Minchan <a href="/Articles/602664/">disagreed</a>,
noting that <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> is a one-time operation, while
<tt>MADV_VOLATILE</tt> can "stick" to a range of memory through several
purge-and-reuse cycles.  John, however, worries that silently substituting
zero-filled pages could lead to data corruption or other unpleasant
surprises. 
<p>
Johannes Weiner, who joined the conversation in June, also <a
href="/Articles/602665/">prefers</a> that purged 
pages be replaced by zero-filled pages on access.  He asked if the patch
set could be reworked on top of <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> (which, he thinks, has a
better implementation internally) to provide a choice: applications could
request either the new-zero-filled-page or the SIGBUS semantics.  John <a
href="/Articles/602691/">responded</a> that he might give it a try,
someday:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'll see if I can look into it if I get some time. However, I
	suspect its more likely I'll just have to admit defeat on this one
	and let someone else champion the effort. Interest and reviews have
	seemingly dropped again here and with other work ramping up, I'm
	not sure if I'll be able to justify further work on this.
</div>
<p>
John certainly cannot be faulted for a lack of effort; this patch set has
been through fourteen revisions since 2011; it has also been the subject of
sessions at the Kernel Summit and Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory
Management Summit.  It has seen extensive revisions in response to comments
from several reviewers.  But, somehow, this feature, which has real users
waiting for it to show up in a mainline kernel, does not seem much closer
to being merged than before.
<p>
At the same time, it is hard to fault the reviewers.  The volatile ranges
concept adds new user-visible memory-management behavior with some subtle
aspects.  If the implementation and interface are not right, the pain will
be felt by developers in both kernel and user space for a long time.
Memory-management changes are notoriously hard to get into the kernel for a
good reason; user-visible changes are even worse.  This patch set crosses
two areas where, past history shows, we have a hard time getting things
right, so some caution is warranted.
<p>
Still, one can't help but wonder if merging nothing at all yields the best
kernel in the long run.  Users will end up working with out-of-tree
variants of this concept (Android's "ashmem" in particular) that the
development community has even less control over.  Unless somebody comes up
with the time to continue trying to push this patch set forward, the
mainline kernel may never acquire this feature, leaving users without a
capability that they demonstrably have a need for.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just as a minor clarification (and I can understand how this was confusing)...<br>
<p>
Minchan's objection mentioned here was somewhat tangential and short-lived. Its stems from a use-case that the Google address-sanitizer folks wanted, where volatility would be sticky and data could be purged, then rewritten and then purged again without any explicit re-marking of volatility.<br>
<p>
I *really* don't see how this use case is at all feasible. Especially as a generic implementation. My specific objections where listed here: <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/116952">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/116952</a><br>
<p>
And after that Minchan agreed and withdrew his objection:<br>
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/116952">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/116952</a><br>
<p>
Johannes' suggestion for zero-fill behavior is viable, and works more in-line with the existing VMM code by overloading the page clean/dirty state as a marker of volatility. My main objection is that this works well from the VMM perspective, but creates more surprising semantics for userspace.  <br>
<p>
Those semantics could become less surprising (but still not my ideal) to userspace with his additional suggestion of adding a SIGBUS option to MADV_FREE, so this is a potential route and I *really do* appreciate the feedback and suggestion (Johannes, Hugh and many other folks have been very kind and motivational in discussions at conferences). Its just that I've run a bit out of steam on this one and have other work I need to do.<br>
<p>
I still think its a really great and needed feature, and it shames me to feel like I've failed in pushing it upstream. But its my hope someone else might be able to pick up the torch here.<br>

Why not both? Add another flag, something like MADV_FAIL_ON_MISSING to send a SIGBUS if you want this behavior.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'd prefer a SIGBUS because it would allow to:<br>
1) Distinguish between legitimate zero-filled pages and pages that have just been evicted.<br>
2) Allow to find code that accesses the volatile regions without proper checking.<br>

Andrea Arcangeli has been working on a "userfaultfd" system call that would let you stop the faulting thread while another thread populates the page. He's using that together with anonymous memory, but perhaps this could be useful for volatile memory ranges too.<br>

Wouldn't userfaultfd just work like a modified signalfd, usable for otherwise deadly signals like SIGBUS because it blocks the signaled thread until the signal gets read?<br>

Kind of, because IIUC userfaultfd also applies to page faults in the kernel.  In the case of KVM, this means that the asynchronous page fault machinery can kick in.<br>

For many use cases, if one page of the range is freed then the rest of it becomes useless.  A simple web cache would not be able to serve a JPEG with four kilobytes missing in the middle.  Is there a way to signal to the kernel 'if you have to free one page from this range, you might as well free the rest of it at the same time'?  The alternative policy would be 'please keep as many pages as possible intact even if some are freed'.<br>

A a bit less simple web cache on the other hand should be able to handle a JPEG with a page missing in the middle. It either can load the page from the disk cache or request the missing range from the web server. No need to download the ranges it still has.<br>

      I suspect the cost of refreshing just one page from the JPEG from the 'net will tend to be almost the same as refreshing the entire image&hellip; and refreshing two (disjoint) pages will almost certainly cost more than the entire image.
<p>Of course, these are just my estimates; they may be wrong in the particular, but I've personally designed systems that did exhibit this behavior. An obvious example is when caching a compressed version of some resource&nbsp;&mdash; restarting compression from the middle is far harder than redoing it all from scratch.

remember that this is less for caching data from the net and more for caching the uncompressed images for faster display.<br>
<p>
so it's more likely to be 4K out of a uncompressed image that the app would just need to pull the appropriate range of data out of the .jpg that it has stored elsewhere.<br>

      Even for this use-case, I suspect repeating the entire decompression would still cost less (and have less bugs) than trying to reconstruct a single page from the middle of the image. And more modern formats (e.g. WebP) make the challenge even greater.

I was imagining that the image wouldn't be cached on disk.  If it were, it would probably be more efficient just to store it on disk and use the kernel's excellent disk caching to keep the pages in memory if there is room - not try to reinvent the wheel by making your own 'disk cache' using nonvolatile memory.  So the use case I was thinking of is where some JPEG image (or any other piece of data) is useful in its entirety, but not with chunks missing in the middle.  In that case if one piece has to be discarded the rest of it might as well be thrown out at the same time.  Surely there is a way to hint this to the kernel?<br>

From a (this at least) user space developer perspective, madvise() sounds like the interface that fits best the proposed behavior. <br>
<p>
But for the sake of clarity I would prefer it to be called MADV_FREEABLE (volatile is also a C keyword with very different semantics). In fact, I think the best flag names would be MADV_FREETRYREMEMBER and MADV_TRYRECALL.<br>

My personal opinion is that there are at least 2 and possibly 3 separate problems that people want to solve and no solution proposed so far solves all of them  suitably.  The problems need to be clearly separated and solved separately.  I think that latest patchset was trying to head in this direction to some extent)<br>

Thanks for the useful article.<br>
<p>
May I humbly suggest that the word “implementation” should be used more conservatively than this, especially as it relates to API design and interface specifiication.<br>
<p>
The article says “Implementations of the volatile range concept have experienced more than the usual amount of change”.  Though this is true, the way it is worded risks confusing issues around interface and implementation.  This is because (i) implementations of the concept have involved different interface designs (as nicely expounded upon in the article), with (ii) implementations of those interfaces also having been through change.  It would be nice, in a world where even advanced developers often don’t understand the value of well-specified interfaces, if we could, for clarity, reserve the word “implementation” for the latter kind of thing, marked (ii) above.<br>
<p>
This confusion also arises in a couple of other places.  We have “Previous volatile range implementations, though, had the property that marking a range nonvolatile could fail partway through. That meant that the interface had to be able to return two values”, which is using the term implementation to talk about the interface, and “This implementation will deliver a SIGBUS signal in that situation”, which is also better described in terms of being an interface thing.<br>
<p>
Later in the article, we have “If the implementation and interface are not right…”, and here the term is clearly being used in the type (ii) sense as defined above.  But, having set up use of the term “implementation” to mean either “implementation of a concept (possibly involving different interfaces)”, and “implementation of an interface”, the confusion sewn earlier is here reaped again.<br>
<p>
All this comes back to a phenomenon way too common in Linux development: hack something together that “works” locally, and whatever happens to be exposed on the outside when it’s “working” then becomes the “interface”.  This is the wrong way round, leads to low quality interface design, and wasted effort.  <br>
<p>
The article does describe thought going into the interface design.  But how much better off would we be if interface design were more widely thought of as being the preceding process to implementation, rather than something to come later if at all?  This doesn’t stop interface specification and implementation being co-iterative: the experience of actually attempting the implementation will often feed back proposed changes to the interface spec.  But viewing interface specification as the fundamentally “earlier” process would have huge benefits.  Most Linux-originated APIs are a wreck — here is part of the reason.<br>

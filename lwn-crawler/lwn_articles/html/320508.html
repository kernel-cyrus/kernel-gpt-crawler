<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>February 25, 2009</br>
           </div>
<p>
In kernel development, there is always tension between the needs of
a new feature versus the needs of the kernel as a whole.  Projects
generally want to get their code merged as early as possible, for a variety
of reasons, while the 
rest of the kernel community needs to be comfortable that the feature is
sensible, desirable, and, perhaps most importantly, maintainable.  The
current push for inclusion of a feature to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/293575/">checkpoint and restart</a> processes
highlights this tension.
</p>

<p>
In late January, Oren Laadan <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/316819/">posted</a> the latest version of his
kernel-based checkpoint and restart code with the notation: "<q>Aiming
for -mm</q>".  There are many possible uses for checkpoints, but it is
an <i>extremely</i> complex problem.  Laadan's current version is quite
minimal, implementing only a fairly small subset of the features
envisioned, but he would like to get the kind of review and testing that
goes along with pushing it towards the mainline.
</p>

<p>
After two weeks without much in the way of comments, another proponent,
Dave Hansen <a href="/Articles/320577/">asked</a> what, if anything, was
holding the patchset back from -mm inclusion.  Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/320569/">replied</a> that he had raised some concerns which
were "<q>inconclusively waffled at</q>" a few months back.  
Morton's opinion carries a fair amount of weight&mdash;not least because he
runs the targeted tree.  He is looking to the future and trying to ensure
that the patches make sense:
<div class="BigQuote">
I am concerned that this implementation is a bit of a toy, and that we
don't know what a sufficiently complete implementation will look like. 
There is a risk that if we merge the toy we either:
<p>
a) end up having to merge unacceptably-expensive-to-maintain code to
   make it a non-toy or
<p>
b) decide not to merge the unacceptably-expensive-to-maintain code,
   leaving us with a toy or
<p>
c) simply cannot work out how to implement the missing functionality.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Morton asked for answers to several questions regarding what features are
available in the current implementation, as well as information on what
needs to be added.  He also asked for indications that Laadan and Hansen
had some thoughts on the design for required, but not
yet implemented, features.  In short, he wants to avoid any of the
scenarios he outlined.  In response to further questions from Ingo Molnar,
Hansen <a href="/Articles/320592/">outlined</a> 
some of the shortcomings of the current implementation:
<div class="BigQuote">
Right now, it is good for very little.  An app has to basically be
either specifically designed to work, or be pretty puny in its
capabilities.  Any fds that are open can only be restored if a simple
open();lseek(); would have been sufficient to get it back into a good
state.  The process must be single-threaded.  Shared memory, hugetlbfs,
VM_NONLINEAR are not supported. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Hansen also had a more detailed <a href="/Articles/320593/">answer</a> to
Morton's questions, which showed a lot of work still to be done.  The
current code only works for x86 architectures, for example, and only for
basic file types, essentially just pipes and regular files.  He likened the
progress of checkpoint/restart to that of kernel scalability; it is a work
in progress, not something that will ever be complete:
<div class="BigQuote">
 We intend to make core kernel
functionality checkpointable first.  We'll move outwards from there as
we (and our users) deem things important, but we'll certainly never be
done.  
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the main concerns is not that there is a lot still to be done, but
that there may be lurking problems that either don't have solutions or can
only be solved by very intrusive kernel changes.  Matt Mackall looked at
Hansen's list of additional features needing to be implemented and <a
href="/Articles/320628/">summed up</a> the worries this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
I think the real questions is: where are the dragons hiding? Some of
these are known to be hard. And some of them are critical [for] checkpointing
typical applications. If you have plans or theories for implementing all
of the above, then great. But this list doesn't really give any sense of
whether we should be scared of what lurks behind those doors.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a free out-of-tree implementation of checkpoint/restart
in the <a href="http://openvz.org">OpenVZ</a> project.  OpenVZ is a
virtualization scheme using its own implementation of
containers&mdash;different from that 
in more recent kernels&mdash;that supports checkpointing and migrating those
containers.  But it is a large patch, which Morton looked at several years
ago and concluded that it would not be welcome in the mainline.  Hansen
<a href="/Articles/320646/">sees</a> OpenVZ as a useful example, but
"<q>with all the input from the OpenVZ folks 
and at least three other projects, I bet we can come up with something
better</q>". 
</p>

<p>
An incremental approach to implementing checkpoints is reasonable, but
Morton is <a href="/Articles/320653/">concerned</a> that by merging the
current patches, the kernel developers will be 
committed to merging something that looks a lot like&mdash;and is as
intrusive as&mdash;the OpenVZ patches.  Molnar is <a
href="/Articles/320655/">more upbeat</a>: he sees it as an important
feature without "<q>many long-term dragons</q>".  He does see one
potential problem area in the incremental approach, though:
<div class="BigQuote">
There is _one_ interim runtime cost: the "can we checkpoint or not"
decision that the kernel has to make while the feature is not complete.
<p>
That, if this feature takes off, is just a short-term worry - as
basically everything will be checkpointable in the long run.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That is one of the technical issues still to be resolved with the current
patchset: how does a process programmatically determine whether it is able
to be checkpointed?   If the process has performed some action while
running on a kernel 
that does not support checkpointing the state caused by that action, there
is a need to be able 
to decide that.  Molnar suggested overloading the LSM security checks such
that performing those actions sets a one-way "not checkpointable" flag as
appropriate. That flag
could be checked by the process or by some other program that was
interested.  Overloading the LSM hooks is not completely uncontroversial, but
it does hook the kernel in many of the right places&mdash;adding an
additional call to those same places for checkpointing is not likely to fly.
</p>

<p>
There was also some question about whether the "not checkpointable" flag
needs to be a one-way flag, as it could be cleared once the process has
returned to a state that is able to be checkpointed.  Molnar <a
href="/Articles/320680/">argued</a> that 
the one-way flag is desirable: "<q>uncheckpointable
functionality should be as  
painful as possible, to make sure it's getting fixed</q>".  Users who
run into problems checkpointing their applications will then apply pressure to
get the requisite state added to checkpoints. As a starting point,
Hansen has <a href="/Articles/320044/">posted</a> a patch that would add a
one-way flag based on the kinds of files a process had opened. 

</p>

<p>
Checkpoints are a useful feature that could be used for migrating processes
to different machines, protecting long-running processes against kernel
crashes or upgrades, system hibernation, and more.  It is a difficult
problem that may never really be completely finished and it touches a lot
of core kernel code.  For these reasons, caution is certainly justified,
but one gets the sense that some kind checkpoint/restart feature will
eventually make its way into the mainline.  Whether it is Laadan's version,
something derived from OpenVZ, or some other mechanism entirely remains to
be seen.

      From a review of the <a href="http://upc-bugs.lbl.gov/blcr/doc/html/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>, it looks kinda hacky: BLCR uses LD_PRELOAD tricks, and its build process requires access to the kernel's System.map, which implies that it uses unexported symbols.

Why does checkpointing need kernel support at all?  A process is able to dump its core to a file, along with details of file descriptors it has open.  In general, any action a process took to get into a particular state, it did by calling normal kernel APIs - so those same APIs should be usable to restore the saved state later.  There might be some missing kernel interface to query the current state ('what file descriptors do I have?') but adding those as needed seems fairly straightforward and not intrusive.<br>
<p>
Why exactly is kernel support needed?<br>

      A user space program can checkpoint itself.  Many do.  This project is about checkpointing an application that wasn't designed for checkpointing, which I suppose saves the enormous engineering effort of building application-specific checkpointing into all the applications.

      <a href="http://cryopid.berlios.de/">CyroPID</a> is a user-space application that can checkpoint other processes without any special support. It doesn't work for all cases, although it's good enough for the "D'oh! I forgot to start this application inside screen(1)" use-case.

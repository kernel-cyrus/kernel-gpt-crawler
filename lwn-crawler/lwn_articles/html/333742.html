           </div>
In an ideal world, our computers would have enough memory to run all of the
applications we need.  In the real world, our systems are loaded with
contemporary desktop environments, office suites, and more.  So, even with
the large amounts of memory being shipped on modern systems, there still
never quite seems to be enough.  Memory gets paged out to make room for new
demands, and performance
suffers.  Some help may be on the way in the form of a new <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/333489/">patch</a> by Wu 
Fengguang which has the potential to make things better, should it ever be
merged.
<p>
The kernel maintains two least-recently-used (LRU) lists for pages owned by
user processes.  One of these lists holds pages which are backed up by
files - they are the page cache; the other list holds anonymous pages which
are backed up by the swap device, assuming one exists.  When the kernel
needs to free up memory, it will do its best to push out pages which are
backed up by files first.  Those pages are much more likely to be
unmodified, and I/O to them tends to be faster.  So, with luck, a system
which evicts file-backed pages first will perform better.
<p>
It may be possible to do things better, though.  Certain kinds of
activities - copying a large file, for example - can quickly fill memory
with file-backed pages.  As the kernel works to recover those pages, it
stands a good chance of pushing out other file-backed pages which are
likely to be more useful.  In particular, pages containing executable code
are relatively likely to be wanted in the near future.  If the kernel pages
out the C library, for example, chances are good that running processes
will cause it to be paged back in quickly.  The loss of needed
executable pages is part of why operations involving large amounts of file
data can make the system seem sluggish for a while afterward.
<p>
Wu's patch tries to improve the situation through a fairly simple change:
when the page reclaim scanning code hits a file-backed, executable page which has the
"referenced" bit set, it simply clears the bit and moves on.  So executable
pages get an extra trip through the LRU list; that will happen repeatedly
for as long as somebody is making use of the page.  If all goes well, pages
running useful code will stay in RAM, while those holding less useful file
data will get pushed out first.  It should lead to a more responsive
system.

</blockquote>
<p>
The code seems to be in a relatively finished state at this point.  So one
might well ask whether it will be merged in the near future.  That is never
a straightforward question with memory management code, though.  This patch
may well make it into the mainline, but it will have to get over some
hurdles in the process.
The first of those hurdles is <a href="/Articles/333753/">a simple
question</a> from Andrew Morton:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Now.  How do we know that this patch improves Linux?
</div>
<p>
Claims like "it feels more responsive" are notoriously hard to quantify.
But, without some sort of reasonably objective way to see what benefit is
offered by this patch, the kernel developers are going to be reluctant to
make changes to low-level memory management heuristics.  The fear of
regressions is always there as well; nobody wants to learn about some large
database workload which gets slower after a patch like this goes in.  In
summary: knowing whether this kind of patch really makes the situation
better is not as easy as one might wish.
<p>
The second problem is that this change would make it possible for a sneaky
application to keep its data around by mapping its files with the
"executable" bit set.  The answer to this objection is easier: an
application which seeks unfair advantage by playing games can already do
so.  Since anonymous pages receive preferable treatment already, the sneaky
application could obtain a similar effect on current kernels by allocating
memory and reading in the full file contents.  Sites which are truly
worried about this sort of abuse can (1)&nbsp;use the memory controller to
put a lid on memory use, and/or (2)&nbsp;use SELinux to prevent
applications from mapping file-backed pages with execute permission
enabled.
<p>
Finally, Alan Cox has <a href="/Articles/333758/">wondered</a> whether this
kind of heuristic-tweaking is the right approach in the first place:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I still think the focus is on the wrong thing. We shouldn't be
	trying to micro-optimise page replacement guesswork - we should be
	macro-optimising the resulting I/O performance.  My disks each do
	50MBytes/second and even with the Gnome developers finest creations
	that ought to be enough if the rest of the system was working
	properly.
</div>
<p>
Alan is referring to some apparent performance problems with the memory
management and block I/O subsystems which crept in a few years ago.  Some
of these issues <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328363/">have been
addressed</a> for 2.6.30, but others remain
unidentified and unresolved so far.
<p>
Wu's patch will not change that, of course.  But it may still make life a
little better for desktop Linux users.  It is sufficiently simple and well
contained that, in the absence of clear performance regressions for other
workloads, it will probably find its way into the mainline sooner or later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is actually something I don't understand. When I do a "cp huge_file somewhere_else", why is it that the kernel insists on caching all that data, while evicting more useful pages. Isn't there a way to realise that "oh, I keep reading from that file descriptor, but I never seem to be re-reading anything I already read"?<br>

      There's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287086/">splice</a>, and for copies within a file system (coming soon to a 4th-generation fs near you) <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/331576/">reflink</a>.

<p>I'm not entirely sure why cp doesn't use these where applicable.  Probably it will, one day.</p>

it's also possible for the application to use madvise to tell the kernel that it doesn't intend to re-use the data.<br>
<p>
the problem is that cp is a generic tool, it doesn't know if you intend to use the data still or not.<br>
<p>
it's common to copy files and then do other things with them, as a result it frequently is the right thing to keep that data in ram.<br>

Again, would need to measure what happens... but I'd believe it isn't <em>that</em> common to look immediately at the recently copied file. At least I normally don't.
<p>
In any case, there are war stories around on "optimizing" something that wasn't used, or very rarely. Ditto for "optimizations" that made things worse.

remember that the kernel doesn't know you are copying the data. it only knows that the app ('cp' is writing a lot of data.<br>
<p>
it is _very_ common for one app to write a lot of data and then have that data used immediatly<br>
<p>
you are asking for the kernel to notice that this one app is reading data and writing the _same_ data. and then drop it from memory.<br>
<p>
what if the process is changing the data as it writes it, should it be kept around or not?<br>
<p>
if an app just reads the data, should you assume that the data will be used again soon or not?<br>
<p>
historicly it has worked pretty well for the system to assume that if one app is interested in the data (reading or writing it) other apps are fairly likely to want that data again soon.<br>
<p>
for every case that someone can raise showing that it isn't needed soon, other cases can be pointed out where it is needed soon. this is why they are reluctant to change the model.<br>

      <p>Only the most primitive caching systems today allow the cache to be swept out by a large sequential read or write.  And they don't use hints from the 'cp' level to prevent it.

<p>Though I don't keep up with Linux virtual page replacement policy, I presume it still does a version of second chance, where a page must be accessed once more after it is added to the cache to reach the "active" state where it can compete with other active pages for use of memory.  Until then, it's only competing with other stuff recently added to the cache.  So the only problem would be if new active data is coming in at the same time as this big file read/write, where Linux would never get the chance to notice that the new data is active.

<p>So there are more sophisticated, highly successful page replacement policies that are used in other OSes and block storage systems, among other places.  One I know keeps track of pages recently evicted so that it can detect when a page is frequently used without having to keep it in memory for a long time on a trial basis.  Others simply detect sequential accesses and when it's clear that the whole sequential stream won't fit in memory, give up on caching stuff from that stream.

<p>With caching papers coming out constantly, I've always wondered why Linux is so unsophisticated in that area.

madvise only works on memory pages ofcourse. I've looked for a way to avoid a program producing lots of data polluting the kernel cache. <br>
<p>
Basically, if I have a process producing say 20MB/s of data, is there a way to tell the kernel not to keep it after it's been written out? There's posix_fadvise but it seems geared to toward pages that have been read in, not pages that have been written out.<br>

When an RDBMS needs to scan through a table, if the table is bigger than available memory then it will not cache any of the pages read.  After all, by the time you got to the end of the table the beginning would have been expired out of the cache anyway, so the next sequential scan would not be any faster.<br>
<p>
It would be possible for the kernel to look at the size of the file opened, and if the file is big relative to available memory, and reading starts at the beginning and moves sequentially forward, then decide not to cache it.  How much of this should be magical heuristics in the kernel, and how much should be hints given to the kernel by the 'cp' program, is a matter of taste.<br>

Well, technically it's not just cp. There's all the system tools that run with cron and scan the whole filesystem (backup, indexing, ...). They all completely trash the interactivity of the system by not only taking up all the disk bandwidth, but also ejecting all the applications pages. I think it may be too much to ask for all these applications to be fixed, so the kernel may be where a fix should be attempted. <br>

For general-purpose utilities something like 'nice' or 'ulimit', specified in a script and operating on a process group, would perhaps be more appropriate than asking the kernel to guess what pages not to bother caching.<br>

Applications have other even simpler ways to receive preferable treatment for their file-backed pages: e.g. just keep referencing each page frequently. (Garbage collectors tend to do this already, admittedly generally for anonymous pages, but that isn't a requirement.)<br>
<p>
And Alan's disks can do 50Mb/s, but can they do that if the incoming workload is very heavily seeky, as is often the case for major faults of pages from text pages of binaries and swap? I doubt it can manage more than 1--5Mb/s in that situation. Even prefaulting neighbouring pages isn't going to help too much there.<br>

I believe that was Alan's point.  He's saying there's more to be gained by getting rid of seekiness than in getting rid of reads of executable files.
<p>
I don't know if he had any particular approach in mind, but there are lots.  For one thing, on a heavily loaded system, which is the kind on which we care most about performance, seek time disappears.  The head can move over a cylinder way faster than the cylinder can turn under the head, and the only time we have long seeks is when there isn't enough work to choose from.

You overestimate current drives. We can't hand it dozens of things and <br>
say 'give me these back in any order you please'; the most we can do is <br>
give it a lot of stuff at once, and ask it to hand them back *in order*.<br>

So under heavy load (especially heavy memory pressure or write pressure), <br>
seek time comes to dominate :(<br>

      <p>You're definitely behind the times - both SATA NCQ drives and SCSI TCQ
drives can handle commands out of order. PATA drives, SATA drives without
NCQ, and SCSI drives without TCQ can't do this; it's also rare to find USB
drives that do this.
<p>So, with a modern laptop drive, I can just shunt 31 commands at it, and
let it handle them in the order that's most sensible for the drive. In
practice, most drives I've encountered appear to have an internal elevator
to minimise seeking; combine this with the deep Linux elevator keeping the
drive fed with commands, and my laptop drive is very successfully
maintaining a high throughput despite a rather seeky pattern.

      Command queuing in the disk drive (NCQ/TCQ) isn't really an essential part of eliminating seek time.  It's main purpose is to eliminate the time you wait to generate a command, get it to the drive, and have the drive interpret it, which it does by allowing you to stream the commands in.
<p>
Linux's ability to queue hundreds of I/Os and send them to the drive in block number order is where most of the seek time elimination happens.  Even on modern drives, it's the case that seek time between to consecutively numbered blocks is usually negligible.
<p>
But even so, we're just talking about what Linux already does -- the point is that it can conceivably do even more to make the disk see sequential block number I/O, and it might be a more profitable investment than trying to make it see less I/O by caching executable pages longer.

SCSI can, sure, but I'd heard that SATA NCQ pretty much couldn't, that it <br>
was notably less capable than TCQ. Obviously I heard wrong :)<br>

In response to Alan Cox's objection, why not both? And by the way, if the system becomes more responsive to the user, so much that the user can actually notice it, it means that probably it's not too much micro as an optimization.<br>

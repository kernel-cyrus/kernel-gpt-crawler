           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 4, 2007</br>
           </div>
The network channels concept was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/169961/">first aired by Van Jacobson</a>
almost two years ago at linux.conf.au 2006.  This idea promises
much-improved networking performance by pushing processing of network data
as close to the end point as possible - perhaps even into user
space.  By getting the kernel out of the packet processing business and by
keeping that processing in a single place (on the same CPU), channel
schemes hope to minimize cache misses, context switches, and other
performance-degrading activities.  Channels have had a rough encounter with
the real world, though; when one starts to consider needs like packet
filtering, address translation, and so on, it gets hard to maintain the
simplicity upon which the performance of channels relies.  So, two years
later, there is no channels implementation which is even close to merging
into the mainline.
<p>

That does not mean that no work is happening in this area, though.  Evgeniy
Polyakov, perhaps the most discouragement-resistant hacker out there,
continues to develop his channel patches; the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260873/">22nd release</a> came out on
December&nbsp;4. 
<p>

This version of the patch has a well-defined internal structure to allow
kernel code to hook into channels.  The best-developed mode, however, is
the one which simply transfers packets to and from user space.  To that
end, there is a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int netchannel_control(struct unetchannel_control *ctl);
</pre>
<p>
The full contents of the <tt>unetchannel_control</tt> structure can be seen
in the patch.  The more important fields are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>cmd</tt>, describing the action that the calling process wishes
     to execute.  Unlike previous versions of the patch, the current code
     only supports one action: <tt>NETCHANNEL_CREATE</tt>, which makes a
     new channel.
<p>
<li> <tt>type</tt>, the type of the channel to create.  At the moment, the
     only implemented type is <tt>NETCHANNEL_COPY_USER</tt>, which copies
     packets to and from user space.
<p>
<li> <tt>unc.data</tt> which describes the channel to be created: it
     contains source and destination addresses and ports and a protocol
     number. 
</ul>
<p>

Once a network channel is created, it is added to a search tree which is
oriented toward blindingly-fast lookups.  There is a new hook in the packet
receive code which looks up each incoming packet in that tree; packets
which do not turn up a hit there are processed normally by the
kernel's networking stack.  Any packet whose addresses, ports, and protocol
are matched by an entry in the tree, however, is shunted over to the
channel code before even being queued by the network stack.
<p>
The final piece (on the receive side) is a simple <tt>read()</tt>
implementation.  A process wishing to receive a packet from a network
channel need only read the associated file descriptor and the next
available packet will be copied into the supplied buffer.  It would, of
course, be nice to do away with that copy operation, but that is a hard
trick to carry out: the packet must be received before its destination is
known.  There are network adapters which can direct packets based on their
header information, but the current netfilter does does not have the driver
API enhancements which would be required to use that capability for
zero-copy packet reception.
<p>

Similarly, a <tt>write()</tt> operation causes the associated packet to be
copied into the kernel and fed into the networking stack at a fairly low
level.  There is currently no zero-copy write support.
<p>

Evgeniy clearly has zero-copy operations in mind, though, probably using
his <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/195292/">network allocator patch</a>.
Even without that feature, though, the channel code, when used with his <a
href="http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/old/?section=projects&item=unetstack">user-space
network stack</a> appears to be quite fast.  Some posted <a
href="http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/blog/2006/12/21#2006_12_21">benchmark
results</a> claim significant improvements over the core Linux networking
stack - three times the maximum bandwidth with one-third of the CPU usage
when small packets are being transferred.  For larger (4096-byte) packets
the performance improvements essentially disappear - most likely the cost
of copying the packets into and out of the kernel is the dominating factor
there.   
<p>

Improvements in small-packet performance are welcome: there are a number of
applications, including high-end financial trading, which require large
numbers of small transfers.  The addition of zero-copy logic has the
potential to make the large-packet performance better as well.  The real
test, though, will be the addition of all of the other features expected by
contemporary networking users, most of which are currently absent from the
channels implementation.  There are hooks in the code aimed at the
insertion of per-packet processing; they could be used for filtering,
address translation, traffic control, or any of the other things that one
might want to have.  Whether those hooks can be used without killing the
performance advantages of channels remains to be seen, though.  But one
suspects that Evgeniy will not give up until he has an answer to that
question.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

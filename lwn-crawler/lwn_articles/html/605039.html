<a href="/Articles/604609/">Control groups</a>
</div>
<p>Having spent two articles exploring some background context concerning
the <a href="/Articles/603762/">grouping of processes</a> and the <a href="/Articles/604413/">challenges of hierarchies</a>, we
need to gain some understanding of control, and for that we will look
at some details of the current (Linux 3.15) cgroups implementation.  First
on the agenda is how control is exercised in cgroups, then, in later
articles, we will look at how hierarchy is used.</p>

<p>Some degree of control existed long before cgroups, of course, with the
"nice" setting to control how much CPU time each process received and
the various limits on memory and other resources that can be
controlled with the <code>setrlimit()</code> system call.  However, this control
was always applied to each process individually or, possibly, to each
process in the context of the whole system.  As such, those controls don't
really provide any hints on how grouping of processes affects
issues of control.</p>

<h4>Cgroup subsystems</h4>

<p>The cgroups facility in Linux allows for separate "subsystems" that
each independently work with the groupings that cgroups provides.
The term "subsystem" is unfortunately very generic.  It would be nicer
to use the term "resource controller" that is often applied.  However,
not all "subsystems" are genuinely "controllers", so we will stay with
the more general term.</p>

<p>In Linux 3.15, there are twelve distinct subsystems which, together, can
provide some useful insights into a number of issues surrounding
cgroups.  We will look at them roughly in order of increasing
complexity; not the complexity of what is controlled, but of how the
groups and, particularly, the hierarchy of groups, is involved in that
control.  Slightly over half will be discussed in this article with
the remainder relegated to a subsequent article.</p>

<p>Before detailing our first seven, a quick sketch of what a subsystem
can do will be helpful. Each subsystem can:</p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li>store some arbitrary state data in each cgroup</li>
<li>present a number of attribute files for each cgroup in the cgroup
   filesystem that can be used to view or modify this state data, or any other state
   details</li>
<li>accept or reject a request to attach a process to a
   given cgroup</li>
<li>accept or reject a request to create a new group
   as a child of an existing one</li>
<li>be notified when any process in some cgroup forks or exits</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, a subsystem can also interact with processes and other
kernel internals in arbitrary ways in order to implement the desired
result.  These are just the common interfaces for interacting with
the process group infrastructure.</p>

<h4>A simple debugging aid</h4>

<p>The <tt>debug</tt> subsystem is one of those that does not "control"
anything, nor does it remove bugs (unfortunately).  It does not
attach extra data to any cgroup, never rejects an "attach" or "create"
request, and doesn't care about forking or exiting.</p>

<p>The sole effect of enabling this subsystem is to make a number of
internal details of individual groups, or of the cgroup system as a
whole, visible via virtual files within the cgroup filesystem.
Details include things like the current reference count on some data
structures and the settings of some internal flags.  These details are
only likely to be at all interesting to someone working on the cgroups
infrastructure itself.</p>

<h4>Identity — the first step to control</h4>

<p>It was <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/r/robertahe137031.html">Robert Heinlein</a> who first exposed me to the idea that
requiring people to carry identity cards is sometimes a first step toward
controlling them.  While doing this to control people may be
unwelcome, providing clear identification for controlling processes can be
quite practical and useful.  This is primarily what the <code>net_cl</code> and
<code>net_prio</code> cgroup subsystems are concerned with.</p>

<p>Both of these subsystems associate a small identifying number with
each cgroup which is then copied to any socket created by a process in
that group. <code>net_prio</code> uses the sequence number that the cgroups core provides each
group with (<code>cgroup-&gt;id</code>) and stores this in the
<code>sk_cgrp_prioidx</code> attribute.  This
is unique for each cgroup.
<code>net_cl</code> allows an identifying number to be explicitly given to each
cgroup, and stores it in the <code>sk_classid</code> attribute.  This is
not necessarily unique 
for each cgroup.
These two different group identifiers are used for three different
tasks.</p>

<ol class="spacylist">
<li>
The <code>sk_classid</code> set by <code>net_cl</code> can <a href="/Articles/569678/">be used</a> with <code>iptables</code> to
   selectively filter packets based on which cgroup owns the
   originating socket.</p>
</li>
<li>
The <code>sk_classid</code> can also <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/net_cls.txt">be used</a> for packet classification during
   network scheduling.  The packet classifier can make decisions based
   on the cgroup and other details, and these decisions can affect
   various scheduling details, including setting the priority of each
   message.</p>
</li>
<li>
The <code>sk_cgrp_prioidx</code> is used purely to set the priority of network
   packets, so when used it overrides the priority set with the
   <code>SO_PRIORITY</code> socket option or by any other means.  A similar
   effect could be achieved using <code>sk_classid</code> and the packet
   classifier.  However, according to the <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5bc1421e34ecfe0bd4b26dc3232b7d5e25179144">commit</a> that introduced the
   <code>net_prio</code> subsystem, the packet classifier
   isn't always sufficient, particularly for data center bridging (DCB)
   enabled systems.</p>
</ol>

<p>Having two different subsystems controlling sockets in three different
ways, with some overlap, seems odd, though it is a little familiar from the
overlap we saw with process groups previously.  Whether subsystems
should be of lighter weight, so it is cheap to have more (one per
control element), or whether they should be more powerful, so just one
can be used for all elements, is not yet clear.  We will come across
more overlap in later subsystems and maybe that will help clarify the
issues.</p>

<p>For the moment, the important issue remaining is how these subsystems
interact with the hierarchical nature of cgroups. The answer is
that, for the most part, they don't.</p>

<p>Both the class ID set for <code>net_cl</code> and the (per-device) priorities set
for <code>net_prio</code> apply just to that cgroup and any sockets associated
with processes in that cgroup.  They do not automatically apply to
sockets in processes in child cgroups.  So, for these subsystems,
recursive membership in a group is not relevant, only immediate
membership.</p>

<p>This limitation is partially offset by the fact that newly created
groups inherit important values from their parent.  So if, for
example, a particular network priority is set for all groups in some
subtree of the cgroup hierarchy, then that priority will continue to
apply to all groups in that subtree, even if new groups are created.
In many practical cases, this is probably sufficient to achieve a
useful result.</p>

<p>This near-disregard for hierarchy makes the cgroups tree look, from
the perspective of these subsystems, more like an organizational
hierarchy than a classification hierarchy (as discussed in the hierarchies
article) — subgroups are not really
sub-classifications, just somewhere convenient that is nearby.</p>

<p>Other subsystems provide more focus on hierarchy in various ways;
three worth contrasting are <code>devices</code>, <code>freezer</code>, and <code>perf_event</code>.</p>

<h4>Ways of working with hierarchy</h4>

<p>One of the challenges of big-picture thinking about cgroups is that
the individual use cases can be enormously different and place
different demands on the underlying infrastructure.  These next three
subsystems all make use of the hierarchical arrangement of cgroups,
but differ in the details of how control flows from the configuration
of a cgroup to the effect on a process.</p>

<h5>devices</h5>

<p>The <code>devices</code> subsystem imposes mandatory access control for some or
all accesses to device-special files (i.e.  block devices and character
devices).  Each group can either allow or deny all accesses by
default, and then have a list of exceptions where access is denied or
allowed, respectively.</p>

<p>The code for updating the exception list ensures that a child never
has more permission than its parent, either by rejecting a change that
the parent doesn't allow or by propagating changes to children.  This
means that when it comes time to perform a permission check, only the
default and exceptions in one group need to checked.  There is no need
to walk up the tree checking that ancestors allow the access too, as
any rules imposed by ancestors are already present in each group.</p>

<p>There is a clear trade-off here, where the task of updating the
permissions is made more complex in order to keep the task of testing
permissions simple.  As the former will normally happen much less
often than the latter, this is a sensible trade-off.</p>

<p>The <code>devices</code> subsystem serves as a mid-point in the range of options
for this trade-off.  Configuration in any cgroup is pushed down to all
children, all the way down to the leaves of the hierarchy, but no further.
Individual processes still need to refer back to the relevant cgroup
when they need to make an access decision.</p>

<h5>freezer</h5>

<p>The <code>freezer</code> subsystem has completely different needs, so it
settles
on a different point in the range.  This subsystem presents a
"<code>freezer.state</code>" file in each cgroup to which can be written
"FROZEN" or 
"THAWED".  This is a little bit like sending <code>SIGSTOP</code> or <code>SIGCONT</code> to
one of the process groups that we met in the first article in that
the whole group of processes is stopped or restarted.  However, most of
the remaining details differ.</p>

<p>In order to implement the freezing or thawing of processes, the
<code>freezer</code> subsystem walks down the cgroup hierarchy, much like the
<code>devices</code> subsystem, marking all descendant groups as frozen or
thawed.  Then it must go one step further.  Processes do not regularly
check if their cgroup has been frozen, so <code>freezer</code> must walk beyond
all the descendant cgroups to all the member processes and explicitly
move them to the freezer or move them out again.  Freezing is arranged
by sending a virtual signal to each process, since the signal handling
code <i>does</i> check if the cgroup has been marked as frozen and acts
accordingly.  In order to make sure that no process escapes the
freeze, <code>freezer</code> requests notification when a process
forks, so it can catch newly created processes — it is the only
subsystem that does this.</p> 

<p>So the <code>freezer</code> occupies one extreme of the hierarchy management
spectrum by forcing configuration all the way down the hierarchy and
into the processes.  <code>perf_event</code> occupies the other extreme.</p>

<h5>perf_event</h5>

<p>The <code>perf</code> facility collects various performance data for some
set of processes.  This set can be all processes on the system, all
that are owned by a particular user, all that descended from some
particular parent, or, using the <code>perf_event</code> cgroup subsystem, all
that are within some particular cgroup.  The <code>perf_event</code> cgroup
subsystem interprets
"within" in a fully hierarchical sense — unlike <code>net_cl</code> which also
tests group membership but does so based on an ID number that may be
shared by some but not all groups in a subtree.</p>

<p>To perform this hierarchical "within a group" test, <code>perf_event</code> uses
the <code>cgroup_is_descendant()</code> function which simply walks up the
<code>-&gt;parent</code> links until it finds a match or the root.
While this is not an overly expensive exercise, particularly if the
hierarchy isn't very deep, it is certainly more expensive than simply
comparing two numbers.  The developers of the networking code are
famous for being quite sensitive to added performance costs,
particularly if these costs could apply to every packet.  So it is not
surprising that the networking code does not use
<code>cgroup_is_descendant()</code>.</p>

<p>The ideal, of course, would be a mechanism for testing membership that
was both fully hierarchical and also highly efficient.  Such a
mechanism is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>For <code>perf</code>, we can see that configuration is never pushed down the
hierarchy at all.  Whenever a control decision is needed (i.e. should this event
be counted?), the code
walks up the tree from a process to find the answer.</p>

<p>If we look back to <code>net_cl</code> and <code>net_perf</code> and ask exactly how they
fit into this spectrum that contrasts pushing configuration down from cgroups
with processes reaching up to receive control, they are most like
<code>devices</code>. Processes do refer back to a single cgroup when
creating a socket, but don't proceed up the hierarchy.  Their distinction
is that the pushing-down of 
configuration is left up to user space rather than being imposed by
the kernel.</p>

<h4>cpuset: where it all began</h4>

<p>The final cgroup subsystem to examine for this installment is <code>cpuset</code>,
which was the first one to be added to Linux.  In fact, the
<code>cpuset</code> mechanism for controlling process groups predates the more
generic cgroups implementation.  One reminder of this is that there is
a distinct <code>cpuset</code> virtual filesystem type that is equivalent to the
<code>cgroup</code> virtual filesystem when configured with the
<code>cpuset</code> subsystem. This subsystem doesn't really introduce anything new, but it does
serve to emphasize some aspects we have already seen.</p> 

<p>
The
<code>cpuset</code> cgroup subsystem is useful on any machine with multiple CPUs, and particularly
on NUMA machines, which feature multiple nodes and, often, wildly different speeds
for access within and between nodes.  Like <code>net_cl</code>,
<code>cpuset</code> provides two distinct, but related, controls.
It identifies a set of processors on which each process in a group may
run, and it also identifies a set of memory nodes from which processes
in a group can allocate memory.  While these sets may often be the
same, the implementation keeps them completely separate; enforcing
the sets involves two completely different approaches.  This is most
obvious when moving a process from one cgroup to another.  If the set
of allowed processors is different, the process can trivially be placed
on the run queue for a new processor on which it is permitted.  If the
set of allowed memory nodes has changed, then migrating all the memory
across from one node to another is far from trivial (consequently this
migration is optional).</p>

<p>Similar to the <code>device</code> subsystem, <code>cpuset</code> propagates any changes
made to a parent into all descendants when appropriate.  Unlike
<code>device</code>, where the cgroup contained the authoritative control
information, each process has its own CPU set that the scheduler
inspects.  Once changes are imposed on descendant groups, <code>cpuset</code>
must take the same final step as <code>freezer</code> and impose the new settings
on individual processes.  Exactly why <code>cpuset</code> doesn't request
notification of forks, while <code>freezer</code> does, will have to remain a mystery.</p>

<p>Combined with this, <code>cpuset</code> will sometimes also walk <em>up</em> the
hierarchy looking for an appropriate parent.  One such case is when a
process finds itself in a cgroup that has no working CPU in its
set, possibly due to a CPU being taken offline.  Another is when a
high-priority memory allocation finds that all nodes in the
<code>mems_allowed</code> set have exhausted their free memory.  In both these
cases, some borrowing of resources that are granted to ancestor nodes
can be used to get out of a tight spot.</p>

<p>Both of these cases could conceivably be handled by maintaining an
up-to-date set of "emergency" processors and memory nodes in each cgroup.  It is likely that the complexity of keeping this extra
information current outweighs the occasional cost of having to
search up the tree to find a needed resource.  We saw before that some
subsystems will propagate configuration down the tree while others
will search for permission up the tree.  Here we see that <code>cpuset</code>
does both, each as appropriate to a particular need.</p>

<h4>The story so far</h4>

<p>These seven cgroup subsystems have something in common that separates
them from the five we will look at in the next article, and this difference
relates to accounting.  For the most part, these seven cgroup subsystems do
not maintain any accounting, but provide whatever service they provide
with reference only to the current instant and without reference to
any recent history.</p>

<p><code>perf_event</code> doesn't quite fit this description as it does record some
performance data for each group of processes, though this data is
never used to impose control.  There is still a very clear difference
between the accounting performed by <code>perf_event</code> and that performed by
the other five subsystems, but we will need to wait until next time to
clarify that difference.</p>

<p>Despite that commonality, there is substantial variety:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">
<li>Some actually impose control (<code>devices</code>, <code>freezer</code>, <code>cpuset</code>),
   while others provide identification to enable separate control
   (<code>net_cl</code>, <code>net_prio</code>) and still others aren't involved in control
   at all (<code>debug</code>, <code>perf_event</code>).</li>
<li>Some (<code>devices</code>) impose control by requiring the core kernel code
   to check with the cgroup subsystem for every access, while others
   (<code>cpuset</code>, <code>net_cl</code>) impose settings on kernel objects (threads,
   sockets) and the relevant kernel subsystems take it from there.</li>
<li>Some handle hierarchy by walking down the tree imposing on
   children, some by walking up the tree checking on parents, some do
   both and some do neither.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is not much among these details that relates directly to the
various issues we found in hierarchies last time, though the emphasis
on using cgroups to identify processes perhaps suggests that
classification rather than an organization is expected.</p>

<p>One connection that does appear is that, as these subsystems do not
depend on accounting, they do not demand a strong hierarchy.  If there
is a need to use <code>net_prio</code> to set the priority for a number of
cgroups and they don't all have a common parent, that need not be a
problem.  The same priorities can simply be set on each group that
needs them.  It would even be fairly easy to automate this if some rule
could be given to identify which groups required the setting.  We have
already seen that <code>net_prio</code> and <code>net_cl</code> require consistent initial
settings to behave as you might expect, and this simply extends that
requirement a little.</p>

<p>So, for these subsystems at least, there is a small leaning toward
wanting a classification hierarchy, but no particular desire for
multiple hierarchies.</p>

<p>Looking further back to the issues that process groupings raised, we
see there continue to be blurred lines of demarcation, with different
subsystems providing similar services, and distinct services being
combined in the same subsystem.  We also see that naming of groups is
important, but apparently not trivial, as we potentially have two
different numeric identifiers for each cgroup.</p>

<p>Of course we haven't finished yet.  Next time we will look at the
remaining subsystems: <code>cpu</code>, <code>cpuacct</code>, <code>blkio</code>, <code>memory</code>, and
<code>hugetlb</code>, to see what they can teach us, and what sort of
hierarchies might best suit them.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<h1>How many page flags do we really have?</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 3, 2009</br>
           </div>
The recently-discussed <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/334747/">kernel
memory sanitization patch</a> was criticized on a number of points, one of
which was its use of a dedicated page flag.  Andi Kleen's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/334928/">HWPOISON patch</a> (enabling
upcoming Intel CPU features for dealing with memory errors) have run into
trouble on similar grounds.  The desperate shortage of page flags has been
an article of faith among kernel developers for years.  But, interestingly,
not everybody agrees that a problem exists, and almost nobody can answer
the simple question of how many flags are available in the first place.  So
a look at the Linux page flags issue seems in order.
<p>
"Page flags" are simple bit flags describing the state of a page of
physical memory.  They are defined in <tt>&lt;linux/page-flags.h&gt;</tt>.
Flags exist to mark "reserved" pages (kernel memory, I/O memory, or simply
nonexistent), locked pages, those under writeback I/O, those which are part
of a compound page, pages managed by the slab allocator, and more.
Depending on the target architecture and kernel configuration options
selected, there can be as many as 24 individual flags defined.
<p>
These flags live in the <tt>flags</tt> field of <tt>struct page</tt>.  This
field is declared to be an <tt>unsigned&nbsp;long</tt>, so one might think
that figuring out how much space is left for new flags would be a
straightforward task.  To a casual observer, it would look like, on a
32-bit system, 24 flags have been used, leaving eight available:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/page-flags.png" width=322 height=52 alt="[Page
flags]">
</blockquote>
In other words, the situation is starting
to get tight, but it is not a crisis quite yet.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
But little is straightforward when it comes to <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>.
One of these structures exists for every physical page in the system; on a
4GB system, there will be one&nbsp;million <tt>page</tt> structures.  Given
that every
byte added to <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> is amplified a million times,
it is not surprising that there is a strong motivation to avoid growing this
structure at any cost.  So <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> contains no less than
three unions and is surrounded by complicated rules describing which fields
are valid at which times.  Changes to how this structure is accessed must
be made with great care.
<p>
Unions are not the only technique used to shoehorn as much information as
possible into this small structure.  Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
systems need to track information on which node each page belongs to, and
which zone within the node as well.  Rather than add fields to
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, the NUMA hackers grabbed the free bits at the
top of the <tt>flags</tt> field, yielding something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/page-flags1.png" width=322 height=78 alt="[Page
flags]">

</blockquote>
<p>
So, on a 32-bit system with 24 page flags
defined (a pessimistic scenario), there are eight bits available for the
node and zone information, practically limiting 32-bit NUMA systems to
64&nbsp;nodes, which is almost certainly adequate.  But the addition of
more page flags would come at the cost of supporting fewer NUMA nodes, and
that would be unwelcome.
<p>
Things get worse on systems with complicated physical memory layouts.  On
such systems, memory is not organized into a single, continuous range of
physical addresses; instead, it is spread out with holes in the middle.
Memory management on these "sparse memory" systems requires that each page
have a "section" number associated 
with it.  That section number is stored - you guessed it - in the spare
bits at the top of the <tt>flags</tt> field.  If space gets too tight, the
kernel will move the node number into a separate array, slowing things down
in the process.  Either way, it seems clear that there is not a whole lot
of spare room in the <tt>flags</tt> field on these systems.
<p>
So the real answer to "how many page flags are free?" is, for all practical
purposes, "zero," at least on 32-bit NUMA systems.  Making room for more
would require expanding <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, which is a heavy cost to
pay.  Developers should, thus, not be surprised when proposals to use new
page flags run into stiff opposition.  It's only one bit, but that bit is
in the middle of some of the most sought-after real estate in the entire
kernel.
<p>
In the case of Andi's HWPOISON patch, this opposition has come in the form
of a number of alternative suggestions.  <a
href="/Articles/335777/">One</a> was to simply use the "reserved" bit, but
that could lead to difficulties in parts of the code where that usage is
not expected.  Then it was <a href="/Articles/335778/">suggested</a> that
the combination of the "reserved" and "writeback" flags could indicate a
poisoned page, but Andi <a href="/Articles/335779/">claims</a> that this
approach cannot work.  Andrew Morton has <a
href="/Articles/335780/">suggested</a> that HWPOISON could be made into a
64-bit-only feature; Andi allows as to how that might be possible, but he
clearly doesn't like the idea.
<p>

Instead, Andi <a href="/Articles/335781/">takes the position</a> that the page flag
shortage does not really exist.  It's not a problem at all on 64-bit
systems, where <tt>unsigned&nbsp;long</tt> is twice as wide.  The number of
32-bit systems with a large number of NUMA nodes is small and shrinking;
it's not something that the developers need be concerned about.  And, says
Andi, if things get really bad, the sparse memory section number can be
moved into a separate array like the NUMA node number.  Given this view of
the problem, worries about adding a useful new feature over concerns about
a single page flag bit seem misplaced.
<p>
Nobody has challenged Andi's view that the problem is not as severe as most
people think, though Andrew Morton has <a
href="/Articles/335783/">hinted</a> that Andi should go ahead and prove his
ideas about moving the section number out of the <tt>page</tt> structure.
That might not be a bad idea.  Even if page flags are a little more
abundant than most developers think, it still is not hard to foresee a time
when they are exhausted, at least on 32-bit systems.  Proposals involving
new page flags are not particularly rare; unless we want to restrict
features needing page flags to 64-bit systems, we'll need to make some more
flags available before too long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Andi position makes sense. In retrospect it seems the really bad idea was to put the NUMA bits on the page flags.<br>

      Why are people willing to accept 4 bytes per physical page waste on a 64 bit system, but not on a 32 bit system?

      <p>One difference is the size of lowmem. On a 32-bit system, those 4 bytes
per page all come out of the first 896MB of physical RAM. On a 64-bit
system, they come out of your total RAM. It's a <b>lot</b> easier to
accept waste when it's not in such a tightly restricted block of memory;
we already have problems with running low on lowmem on 32-bit systems with
more than around 8GB RAM, which are best solved by going to 64-bit.

Yeah, I was left wondering why the page flags are an unsigned long rather than a uint32_t? <br>
Surely in such a space constrained data structure it's best to use only as many bits as <br>

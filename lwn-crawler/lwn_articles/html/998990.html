The 6.13 merge window closed with the release of <a
href="/Articles/1000378/">6.13-rc1</a> on December&nbsp;1.  By that time,
11,307 non-merge commits had been pulled into the mainline
repository; about 9,500 of those landed after <a
href="/Articles/998623/">our first-half merge-window summary</a> was
written.  There was a lot of new material in these patches, including
architecture-support improvements, new BPF features, an efficient way to
add guard pages to an address space, more Rust support, a vast number of
new device drivers, and more.

The most interesting changes merged during the latter half of the 6.13
merge window include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for PowerPC "Maple" platforms has been removed.  According to
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/62f8f307c80e">this commit</a>:
     "<q>Sadly all those machines have passed into memory, and there's been
     no evidence for years that anyone is still using any of them</q>".
<li> The Loongarch architecture has gained support for realtime preemption
     and lazy preemption.
<li> The kernel now supports the "Smmpm", "Smnpm", and "Ssnpm" RISC-V
     pointer-masking extensions; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/09d6775f503b">this commit</a>
     contains some documentation.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new <tt>kmem_cache</tt> iterator that enables BPF programs
     to obtain information about the state of the slab allocator.  There is
     no documentation, but <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1477d31b1c9a">this merge
     message</a> gives an overview, and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a496d0cdc84d">this commit</a>
     contains a test program using this feature.
<li> The new <tt>bpf_send_signal_task()</tt> kfunc allows a BPF program to
     send a signal to another process.
<li> There is a new BPF map feature that allows threads to share some
     memory with a BPF scheduler (implemented with <a
     href="/Articles/991205/">sched_ext</a>).  The idea is to share hints
     about the workload that will let the scheduler do a better job.  The
     feature is undocumented; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c6fb8030b4ba">this merge
     message</a> for an overview, and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4579b4a4279e">this commit</a> for a
     test program.
<li> BPF programs can now have a private stack, reducing the risk of
     overflows in long call chains.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c1bc51f85cd6">This merge
     message</a> contains an overview of the feature and its motivation.
     Only x86-64 systems support this feature for now.
<li> Support has been added to allow system-call entry and exit tracepoints
     to incur page faults in order to read user-space parameters.
<li> There is a new <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
     operation, <tt>MADV_GUARD_INSTALL</tt>, that installs "guard" pages in
     the indicated address range; an attempt to access a guard page will
     result in a <tt>SIGSEGV</tt> signal.  These guard pages are a more
     efficient way to prevent code from running off the end of an
     allocation than <tt>PROT_NONE</tt> mappings (the only current way to
     do that) because it does not require the allocation of a new virtual
     memory area.  <tt>MADV_GUARD_REMOVE</tt> will remove existing guard
     pages.  See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/662df3e5c376">this
     commit</a> for a bit more information.
<li> The new <tt>transparent_hugepage_shmem=</tt> command-line parameter
     controls the policy for the allocation of transparent huge pages in
     the shmem/tmpfs filesystems; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/949042811117">this commit</a> for
     some more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The EROFS filesystem has gained support for the <tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> and
     <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt> <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html"><tt>lseek()</tt></a>
     options.
<li> As <a href="/Articles/995116/">expected</a>, the reiserfs filesystem
     has been removed from the kernel. 

<li> The F2FS filesystem has a new feature, called "device aliasing", that
     allows a portion of a block device to be set aside.  "<q>Essentially,
     this mechanism allows a portion of the f2fs area to be temporarily
     reserved and used by another filesystem or for different
     purposes. Once that external usage is complete, the device aliasing
     file can be deleted, releasing the reserved space back to F2FS for its
     own use.</q>" See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/128d333f0dff">this commit</a> for
     a documentation update.

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <a href="/Articles/992455/">Trace events in Rust code</a> are now
     supported.
<li> Rust bindings for misc devices have been added, opening the door
     to the merging of a number of drivers in future development cycles.
<li> See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b50ecc5aca4d">this merge
     message</a> for a summary of new features added to the <tt>perf</tt>
     tool.
<li> The build system has gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/995397/">optimization with AutoFDO and Propeller</a>.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Networking performance in many cases is constrained by contention on
     the RTNL lock — a problem that has been understood for years.  The
     6.13 kernel contains work turning the RTNL lock into a
     per-network-namespace lock as a way of reducing that contention in
     namespace-heavy workloads (running containers, for example).  It is
     just one step in a long process, and the regression potential is
     considered to be significant, so the per-namespace behavior is
     disabled by default.  The <tt>DEBUG_NET_SMALL_RTNL</tt> configuration
     variable can be used to turn it on.
<li> There is a new, more flexible API for the control of traffic shaping;
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/bdb5d2481a53">this merge
     message</a> gives an overview of how it works.
<li> There is a new netlink API for the control of NAPI (polling) behavior
     in network drivers; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5bedbfc16552">this merge
     message</a> provides an overview.
<li> The long-obsolete wireless extensions emulation within the kernel
     will no longer export a set of symbols to loadable modules.  No
     in-tree drivers need that feature at this point; it is possible that
     out-of-tree drivers might break.
<li> There is a new mechanism allowing network drivers to suspend
     interrupts during busy-traffic periods; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/80b6f094756f">this merge
     message</a> for more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/iommufd.html">IOMMUFD
     subsystem</a> has gained a number of new operations aimed at better
     support for virtual machines; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/341d041daae5">this merge
     message</a> for an overview.
<li> The sound subsystem has a new pass-through mode for audio-related
     accelerators; <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/04177158cf98">this
     commit</a> includes an overview document.
<li> The new virtual CPU-frequency driver allows CPU-frequency coordination
     between hosts and guests; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4fd06a5358e0">this commit</a> for a
     little more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new memory allocator for Rust code that removes the
     dependency on the external <tt>Alloc</tt> module.  Internal
     documentation for the associated <tt>Allocator</tt> trait can be found
     in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b7a084ba4fbb">this
     commit</a>.  There are also kernel-specific implementations of
     <tt>Box</tt> and <tt>Vec</tt> that use this allocator; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c8cfa8d0c0b1">this commit</a> for
     some internal <tt>Box</tt> documentation and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2aac4cd7dae3">this commit</a> for
     <tt>Vec</tt>. 
<li> There were 231 exported symbols removed in 6.13, while 443 new
     exports were added; there are also 11 new kfuncs.  See <a
     href="/Articles/1000371/">this page</a> for the full list.
</ul>
<p>
The 6.13 kernel development cycle now moves into the stabilization phase
where, with luck, the bulk of the bugs that have inevitably been introduced
will be fixed.  The 6.13 release can be expected on January&nbsp;19

      It came in as a part of the pile of GPIB stuff, so I put it there; it could have gone in either category.

GPIB in 2024 feels like a shrieking anachronism.   What's next, CAMAC crate support?   I remember well when GPIB was called "HPIB" and connected gigantic boxes in cabinet racks.<br>

In our physics labs we use GPIB.  All that old equipment is still valuable once in a while.  Having the drivers in tree is nice.<br>

+1 There are many equipment even in production today which uses GPIB. <br>
<p>
See for example Keysight 3458A 8.5 Digit Digital Multimeter<br>

<p>
Only external interface for communication is GPIB and device is on top of the class for voltage range from 0.1 to 100 V.  It is possible that there is no near alternative which can be bought from stock still. See 2019 discussion on eevBlog<br>
<p>

<p>
The Czech Technical University in Prague purchased additional two two years ago and run measurements for our ESA project. You can see the setup description on pages 17 to 19 of the report<br>

<p>
Two 3458A, B2912A, 34410A (all HP descendants) and Stanford Research Systems DS 360 has been connected by GPIB. Only climabox and our Zynq Xilinx serial/SpaceWire coded line receiver from nanoXplore have been connected by Ethernet. Python instrumentation has been run on Windows in this case<br>

<p>
But with proper drivers it could run from GNU/Linux and inclusion of drivers to mainline makes that much more easier than building out of source drivers.<br>
<p>
So I am happy that these drivers has been included.<br>

The comment by SIB that old equipment is still valuable makes sense.   I was forced to program GPIB with Visual Studio back in the day, although I was under the impression that National Instruments had Linux support for GPIB for a long time.<br>
<p>
Is there any earthly reason why one would choose GPIB over a regular network connection, given the choice?   Yes, the timeliness requirements for different kinds of data vary, but QoS can address that need.   Another possibility would be PCIe/thunderbolt, but power constraints may block that solution.  Are all the still-available-for-purpose GPIB instruments all legacy designs?  <br>

      <p>For new instruments, you'd use SCPI over Ethernet or USB instead of over GPIB parallel bus (same data framing, same content, different physical layer). But the big reason that GPIB still matters is that lab instruments are built like tanks and last a very long time - why spend $10m on equipping yourself with instruments when you can get the same quality by mixing old (GPIB) and new (Ethernet) for $1m?

GPIB is also multi-master and has provisions for triggering and synchronization.<br>
<p>
Ethernet is decent enough, but one has to jump through a lot more hoops to achieve the same result.<br>
<p>
At the end of the way GPIB works _very_ well, despite "better" technologies being available for decades.<br>
<p>
(At $dayjob-2 our lab had multiple racks running 24/7, each with about $1M worth of gear, running using a combination of  USB and GPIB.  The mostly-new instruments were all GPIB; the control plane stuff tended to be USB-to-GPIO or serial)<br>

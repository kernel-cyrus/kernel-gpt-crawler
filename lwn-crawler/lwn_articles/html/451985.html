<p>
The <tt>setuid()</tt> system call has always been something of a security
problem for Linux (and other Unix systems).  It interacts oddly with
security and other kernel features (e.g. the unfortunately named "<a
href="http://userweb.kernel.org/~morgan/sendmail-capabilities-war-story.html">sendmail-capabilities
bug</a>") and is often used incorrectly in programs. But, it is part of the
Unix legacy, and one that will be with us at least until the 2038 bug puts
Unix systems out of their misery.  A recent patch from Vasiliy Kulikov arguably shows
these kinds of problems in action: weird interactions with resource limits
coupled with misuse of the <tt>setuid()</tt> call.
</p>

<p>
There is a fair amount of history behind the problem that Kulikov is trying
to solve.  Back in 2003, programs that used <tt>setuid()</tt> to switch to
a non-root user could be used to evade the limit on the number of processes
that an administrator had established for that user
(i.e. <tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt>).  But that was fixed with a <a
href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/13/226">patch from Neil Brown</a> that
would cause the <tt>setuid()</tt> call to fail if the new user was at or above
their process limit.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, many programs do not check the return value from calls to
<tt>setuid()</tt> that are meant to reduce their privileges.  That, in
fact, was exactly the hole that sendmail fell into when Linux capabilities
were introduced, as it did not check to see that the change to a new UID
actually succeeded. Buggy programs that don't check that return
value can cause fairly serious security problems because they assume their
actions are limited by the reduced privileges of the
switched-to user, but 
are actually 
still operating with the increased privileges (often root) that they
started with.  In effect, the 2003 change made it easier for attackers to
cause <tt>setuid()</tt> to fail when <tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt> was being used.
</p>

<p>
Kulikov <a href="/Articles/452037/">described</a> the problem back in June,
noting that it was not a bug in Linux, but allowed buggy privileged
programs to wreak havoc:
<div class="BigQuote">
 I don't consider checking RLIMIT_NPROC in
setuid() as a bug (a lack of syscalls return code checking is a real
bug), but as a pouring oil on the flames of programs doing poorly
written privilege dropping.  I believe the situation may be improved by
relatively small ABI changes that shouldn't be visible to normal
programs.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In the posting, he suggested two possible solutions to the problem. The
first is to
move the check against <tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt> from <tt>set_user()</tt>
(a <tt>setuid()</tt> helper function) to <tt>execve()</tt> as most programs
<i>will</i> check the status of that call (and can't really cause
any harm if they don't).  The other suggestion is one that was <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/19/129">proposed</a> by Alexander
Peslyak (aka Solar Designer) in 2006 to cause a failed <tt>setuid()</tt>
call to send a <tt>SIGSEGV</tt> to the process,
which would presumably terminate those misbehaving programs.
<p>
The first solution is not complete because it would still allow users
to violate their process limit by using programs that do a
<tt>setuid()</tt> that is not followed by an <tt>execve()</tt>, but that is a
sufficiently rare case that it isn't considered to be a serious problem.
Peslyak's solution was seen as too big of a hammer when it was proposed,
especially for programs that <i>do</i> check the status of
<tt>setuid()</tt>, and might have proper error handling for that case.
</p>

<p>
There were no responses to his initial posting, but when he brought it back
up on July 6, he was <a href="/Articles/452047/">pleasantly surprised</a>
to get a <a href="/Articles/452178/">positive response</a> from Linus Torvalds:
<div class="BigQuote">
My reaction is: "let's just remote the crazy check from set_user()
entirely". If somebody has credentials to change users, they damn well
have credentials to override the RLIMIT_NPROC too, and as you say,
failure is likely a bigger security threat than success.
<p>
The whole point of RLIMIT_NPROC is to avoid fork-bombs. If we go over
the limit for some other reason that is controlled by the super-user,
who cares?
</div>
</p>

<p>
That led to the <a
href="/Articles/452034/">patch</a>, which changed <tt>do_execve_common()</tt> to return
an error (<tt>EAGAIN</tt>) if the user was over their process limit and
removed the check from <tt>set_user()</tt>.  The patch was generally
well-received, 
though several commenters were not convinced that it should go into the -rc
for 3.0 as Torvalds had suggested.  In fact, as Brown dug into the patch, he
<a href="/Articles/452105/">saw a problem</a> that might need addressing:
<div class="BigQuote">
Note that there is room for a race that could have unintended consequences.
<p>
Between the 'setuid(ordinary-user)' and a subsequent 'exit()' after execve()
has failed, any other process owned by the same user (and we know where are
quite a few) would fail an execve() where it really should not.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Basically, the problem is that switching the process to a new user could
now exceed the process limit, but that limit wouldn't actually be enforced
until an <tt>execve()</tt> was done (the failure of which would presumably
cause the process to exit).  In the interim, any <tt>execve()</tt> from
another of the user's processes would fail.  It's not clear how big of a
problem that is, 
though it could certainly lead to unexpected behavior.  Brown offered up
a <a href="/Articles/452112/">patch</a> that would address the problem by
adding a process flag (<tt>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED</tt>)  that would be set
if a <tt>setuid()</tt> caused the process to exceed <tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt>
and would then be checked in <tt>do_execve_common()</tt>.  Thus, only the
<tt>execve()</tt> in the offending process would fail.
</p>

<p>
Kulikov and Peslyak liked the approach, though Peslyak was not convinced it
added any real advantages over Kulikov's original patch.  He also <a
href="/Articles/452113/">pointed out</a> that there could be a
indeterminate amount of time between the <tt>setuid()</tt> and
<tt>execve()</tt>, so the <tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt> test should be repeated when
<tt>execve()</tt> is called: "<q>It would be surprising to see a process
fail on execve() because of RLIMIT_NPROC when that limit had been
reached, say, days ago and is no longer reached at the time of
execve().</q>" 
</p>

<p>
So far, Brown has not respun the patch to add that test.  There is also the
question of whether the problem that Brown is concerned about needs to be
addressed at all, and whether it is worth using up another process flag
bit (there are currently only three left) to do so.  In the end, some kind
of fix is likely to go in for 3.1 given Torvalds's interest in seeing this
problem with buggy programs disarmed.  It's unclear which approach will win
out, but either way, <tt>setuid()</tt> will not fail due to exceeding the
allowable number of processes.
</p>

<p>
As Kulikov and others noted, it is definitely <i>not</i> a bug in the
kernel that is being fixed here.  But, it is a common enough error in
user-space programs&mdash;often with dire consequences&mdash;which makes it
worthwhile to fix as a <a href="/Articles/451405/">pro-active security
measure</a>. Peslyak <a href="/Articles/452139/">listed</a> several recent
security problems that arose from programs that do not check the return
value from <tt>setuid()</tt>.  He also noted that the problem is not
limited to setuid-root programs, as other programs that try to switch to a
lesser&mdash;differently&mdash;privileged user can also cause
problems when using <tt>setuid()</tt> incorrectly.
</p>

<p>
The impact of this fix is quite small, and badly written user-space
programs&mdash;even those meant to run with privileges&mdash;abound, which
makes this change more palatable than some other pro-active fixes. As we
have seen before, <tt>setuid()</tt> is subtle and quick to anger; it can
have <a href="/Articles/368730/">surprising interactions</a> with other
seemingly straightforward security measures. Closing a hole with
<tt>setuid()</tt>, even if the problem lives in user space, will definitely
improve overall Linux security.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In part the problem is that *only* Linux can fail setuid(), since only Linux lets an untrusted user manipulate the environment to affect a security-critical trust transition of the superuser account. And not even the environment of the process itself (such as capabilities), but a restriction induced by arbitrary other processes.<br>
<p>
Software written on other OSes, where setuid() can only fail for EPERM, is not buggy on those OSes. It might not be *robust*, in being portable to unpredicted future environments, but it's not buggy either. Until it's run on Linux.<br>
<p>
Thus CVE-2011-0017 affecting Exim, fixed with 4.74 in January of this year. Exim was originally written on Solaris. When a root-started daemon, with a clean environment, fails to transition to the user which exists solely to be the unprivileged user, you have a potential privilege escalation attack, on just the one OS.<br>

I find it difficult to understand the overall interaction issues here too.<br>
<p>
RLIMIT_NPROC is here to prevent fork bombs (mostly from unprivileged accounts) and setuid() to allow a process to reduce its privileges (mostly for privileged accounts). Am I right?<br>
How do they interact?<br>

Hmm, I had hoped that I made that clear in the article, sorry that I didn't.  When a process does a setuid() to another user, it needs to "fit" in the new user's RLIMIT_NPROC (or else users can evade that limit by way of setuid programs).  So, when a privileged process changes its UID by way of setuid(), something needs to be done to enforce RLIMIT_NPROC.  Failing the setuid() itself can cause problems with badly written programs, so these patches are ways to enforce that limit without returning an error from setuid().<br>

Does that help?<br>

The classic example (the version I've seen is for a BSD, contrary to the comment at the top) is that a user comes in via SSH.<br>
<p>
SSH creates a new process to handle the connection, authenticates the user, then setuid() to the user and execs the shell.<br>
<p>
But if none of these steps enforce limits, the user can just SSH in as often as they like despite the administrator setting a limit.<br>

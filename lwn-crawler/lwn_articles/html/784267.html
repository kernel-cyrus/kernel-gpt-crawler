<p><a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt">BFQ</a>
is a proportional-share I/O scheduler available for block
devices since the 4.12 kernel release. It associates each process or group
of processes with a weight, and 
grants a fraction of the available  I/O bandwidth
proportional
to that weight. BFQ also tries
to maximize system responsiveness and to minimize latency for
time-sensitive applications. Finally, BFQ aims at boosting
throughput and at running efficiently.  A new set of changes has improved
BFQ’s performance with respect to all of these criteria. In
particular, they increase the throughput that BFQ reaches
while handling the most challenging workloads for this I/O scheduler. A
notable example is <a href="https://dbench.samba.org/">DBENCH</a>
workloads, for which BFQ now provides 150% more throughput. These
changes also improve BFQ’s I/O control — applications start about 80% more
quickly under load — and  BFQ itself now runs about 10% faster.</p>

<p>Let’s start with throughput improvements and, to introduce them, let’s
examine the main cause of throughput loss with BFQ.</p>

<h4>I/O-dispatch plugging: a necessary evil that lowers throughput</h4>

<p>In BFQ, I/O requests from each process are
directed into one of a set of in-scheduler queues, called "bfq-queues".
Multiple processes may have their requests sent to a shared bfq-queue, as
explained in more detail later. A bfq-queue is tagged as being either
synchronous or asynchronous if the I/O requests it
contains are 
blocking or non-blocking for the process that issues them, respectively.
Read requests tend to be blocking, since the reading process cannot
continue without that data; writes are often non-blocking and, thus,
asynchronous.

<p>BFQ serves each bfq-queue, one at a time, with a frequency
determined by its associated weight. If "Q" is a
synchronous bfq-queue then, to preserve Q’s allotted bandwidth,
BFQ cannot switch to serving a new bfq-queue when Q becomes
temporarily empty while in service.  Instead, BFQ must plug the
dispatching of other I/O, possibly already waiting in other bfq-queues,
until a new request arrives for Q (or until a timeout occurs).</p>

<p>With fast drives, this service scheme creates a critical
shortcoming. Only one core at a time can insert I/O
requests into a bfq-queue; a single core may easily be slower to insert
requests than a fast drive can serve the same requests. This
results in Q often becoming empty while in service. If BFQ is not allowed
to switch to another queue when Q becomes empty then, during the servicing
of Q, there will be frequent time intervals
during which Q is empty and the device can only consume the I/O already
submitted to its hardware queues (possibly even becoming idle). This easily
causes considerable loss of throughput.</p>

<p>The new changes address this issue in two ways: by improving
how BFQ tries to fill the resulting service holes and
by reducing the cases where I/O dispatching is actually plugged.
We will only look at the main new improvement concerning the second
countermeasure.</p>

<h4>Improving extra-service injection</h4>

<p>BFQ implements an I/O-injection mechanism that tries
to fill the idle times occurring during the servicing of a bfq-queue with
I/O requests taken from other, non-in-service bfq-queues. The hard part is
finding the right amount of I/O to inject so as to both boost throughput
and not break bandwidth and latency guarantees for the in-service
bfq-queue. Before the changes described in this section, the mechanism
tried to compute this amount as follows. First, it measured the
bandwidth enjoyed by a given bfq-queue when it was not subjected to any
extra-service injection. Then, while that bfq-queue was in service, BFQ
tried to inject
the maximum possible number of extra requests that did not cause the target
bfq-queue's bandwidth to decrease too much.</p>

<p>This solution had an important shortcoming: for bandwidth measurements
to be stable and reliable, a bfq-queue must remain in service for a much
longer time 
than that needed to serve a single I/O request. Unfortunately, this does
not happen with many workloads.
With the new changes, the service times of single I/O requests, rather than
the bandwidth experienced by a bfq-queue,
are measured. Injection is then tuned as a
function of how much it increases service times. Single-request service
times are
 meaningful even if a bfq-queue completes few I/O requests
while it is in service.</p>

<p>The throughput boost on SSDs is now about 50% on the hardest workloads
for BFQ: those that trick BFQ into doing a lot of
often unnecessary plugging of I/O dispatches. We’ll see this result on a
graph in a moment, combined with the throughput boost provided by the
following improvement.</p>

<h4>Disable queue merging on flash storage with internal queuing</h4>

<p>Some applications, such as QEMU, spawn a set of
processes that perform interleaved I/O. Such an I/O, taken in isolation
(per process), appears random, but it becomes sequential when merged with
that of all the other processes in the set. To boost throughput with these
processes, BFQ performs queue merging; it redirects the I/O of
these processes into a common, shared bfq-queue.</p>

<p>Since they are ordered by I/O-request position, the I/O requests in the
shared bfq-queue 
are sequential. On devices like rotational disks, serving such a sequential I/O
definitely boosts throughput compared with serving the random I/O generated
by the
processes separately. But that is not the case on flash storage devices with
internal queuing, which enqueue many I/O requests and serve them in
parallel, possibly reordering requests so as to maximize throughput. Thanks
to these optimizations and their built-in parallelism, these devices reach
the same throughput for interleaved I/O, with or without BFQ
reordering. In view of this fact, the new changes disable queue merging
altogether on these devices.</p>

<p>As counter-intuitive as it may seem, disabling queue merging actually boosts
throughput on these devices; queue merging tends to make many
workloads artificially more uneven. Consider the case where one of the
bfq-queues in a set of merged bfq-queues has a higher weight than a normal
bfq-queue, and where the shared bfq-queue inherits that high weight. I/O
dispatching must be plugged while serving the shared bfq-queue, to preserve
the higher bandwidth demands of this bfq-queue. In addition, the bfq-queue
is filled 
by several processes, so it tends to remain active for a longer
time than normal bfq-queues. In the end, it may force BFQ to perform I/O
plugging for a lot of time, hurting overall throughput.</p>

<p>To evaluate the benefits of this improvement, we measured the throughput
with DBENCH for the
configuration causing the highest throughput loss with BFQ: six
clients on a filesystem with journaling, with the journaling daemon
enjoying a higher weight than normal processes, and with all other
parameters configured as in the DBENCH test in the <a
href="https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests">MMTests</a> suite. The throughput
grew by about 50% on SSDs. The combined effect of this and
the service-injection improvement is shown below:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/bfq/dbench.png" alt="[DBENCH
    throughput]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>

This plot shows throughput on a
PLEXTOR PX-256M5 SSD, compared with the maximum throughput reached by
the mq-deadline scheduler (which, in turn achieves the highest throughput among
non-BFQ I/O schedulers).</p>

<h4>Improving responsiveness</h4>

<p>When waiting for the arrival of a new I/O request for the in-service
bfq-queue, a timeout needs to be set to avoid waiting forever if the
processes associated with the bfq-queue have stopped doing I/O. Even if the
timeout avoids infinite waiting, the drive is still not fed with new I/O
until the timer fires (in the absence of injection). This lowers throughput and
inflates latencies. For this reason, the timeout is kept relatively low;
8ms is the current default.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, such a low value may cause a violation of bandwidth
guarantees for processes that happen to issue new I/O requests just a
little too late. The higher 
the system load, the higher the probability that this will happen; it is a
problem in scenarios where service guarantees matter more than
throughput. One important case is when, for example, an application is being
started, or is performing some interactive task (such as opening a file). To
provide a high level of responsiveness to the application, its
I/O requests must be served quickly. This implies that, in the presence of
other workloads competing for storage bandwidth,
the bfq-queue for the application must be granted a 
high fraction of the available storage bandwidth. To reach this goal, BFQ
tries to 
automatically detect such queues and raise their weight. But the benefit of
this higher weight will be lost in case of late I/O arrivals.</p>

<p>To address this issue, BFQ now places a 20ms lower bound on the
dispatch-plugging 
timeout for weight-raised bfq-queues. This simple change reduces
application start-up times under load by up to 80%.  This  plot show
the start-up times of GNOME terminal on a PLEXTOR PX-256M5S drive while
ten files are being read sequentially in parallel (10r-seq), or
while five files are being read sequentially in parallel, and five more
files are being written sequentially in parallel (5r5w-seq).
<p>
<blockquote>

times]" class="photo">
</blockquote>



 As a
reference, start-up times with KYBER are reported too; they are
the second lowest start-up times after those with BFQ.</p>
<p>
<h4>Reducing execution time</h4>

<p>Handling queue merging costs CPU time, so disabling it reduced the
execution time of BFQ, by about 10%, as shown below  for an Intel Core
i7-2760QM system:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/bfq/exec-time.png" alt="[BFQ execution time]"
       class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
As a reference, the figure also shows the execution time of
mq-deadline, the simplest available I/O scheduler in the kernel.

<p>To provide more detail: the total times in the figure are the sums of the
execution times over three request-processing events: enqueue, dispatch,
and completion. So the amortized cost of BFQ, per event, decreased to about
0.6µs, against 0.2µs for mq-deadline.</p>

<p>This improvement reduced the number of CPU and drive configurations for
which BFQ cannot currently be used (but mq-deadline can) due to its
execution cost.  The remaining configurations are those in
which switches between user and kernel context, plus
0.2µs of I/O-scheduling overhead, are feasible, but for which 
an extra 0.4µs per event is not tolerable.</p>
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Thanks to these new improvements, BFQ seems now to be on par
with the other I/O schedulers in terms of throughput, even with 
workloads that previously "fooled" its heuristics. In contrast, the
execution time of BFQ is still higher 
than that of the other I/O schedulers, but it is not higher than
single-request service times on fast drives. The problem now is that
BFQ uses a single, per-device scheduler lock.  Stay tuned for future work,
which will increase parallelism within the BFQ scheduler itself.

noop no longer exists, that went away with the legacy IO stack. The equivalent now is 'none'.<br>
<p>
That aside, I do agree, it would have been prudent to have all graphs include none/mq-deadline/kyber instead of picking and choosing a particular one for each test. Selectively including a particular scheduler for each comparison can seem a bit shady.<br>

For brevity, I showed results only for the best performing other I/O schedulers. Full results for these and other tests can be found here:<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; BFQ serves each bfq-queue, one at a time, with a frequency determined by its associated weight. If "Q" is a synchronous bfq-queue then, to preserve Q’s allotted bandwidth, BFQ cannot switch to serving a new bfq-queue when Q becomes temporarily empty while in service. Instead, BFQ must plug the dispatching of other I/O, possibly already waiting in other bfq-queues, until a new request arrives for Q (or until a timeout occurs).</font><br>
<p>
I don't think I understand this. Is it that there's a time period where a queue is waiting to dispatch i/o for its processes and, if idle, the queue will block to allow the processes attached to the queue their fair slot if they need it? Why not fall to the next queue period but interleave from the idle queue if i/o resumes while you're still in the time window? (I guess it's not as simple as that -- and maybe the BFQ interleaving does some of this work already.)<br>

The reason behind this plugging is not so apparent. The problem occurs when a high-weight, sync bfq-queue does not become empty because its associated process has finished doing I/O, but just because its associated process is blocked (waiting for pending sync I/O to complete). Let's call Q this bfq-queue. If bfq switched to serving other queues, then, when Q gets new I/O a moment later, Q is likely to find the storage busy, and possibly several other I/O requests already queued in the device. So Q may have to wait for the completion of these extra requests, before finally having its own I/O served. This may easily cause Q to get less than its fair share of the device throughput. Usually, the end result is that Q gets the same bandwidth as other, lower-weight bfq-queues, instead of getting more.<br>

In your article, you didn't mention nothing about BFQ vs hibernation issues. I have enabled bfq following a great article about I/O schedulers available in ArchLinux site, but since then, wakeup from hibernation is not possible. It hangs while trying to wake up system.<br>
<p>
Any suggestion? Thank you<br>

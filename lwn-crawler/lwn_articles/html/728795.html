           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 26, 2017</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><tt>membarrier()</tt>
system call</a> is arguably one of the strangest 
offered by the Linux kernel.  It expensively emulates an operation that can be
performed by a single unprivileged barrier instruction, using an invocation
of the kernel's read-copy-update (RCU) machinery — all in the name of
performance.  But, it would seem, <tt>membarrier()</tt> is not fast enough,
causing users to fall back to complex and brittle tricks.  An attempt to
fix the problem is now under discussion, but not everybody is convinced
that the cure is better than the disease.
<p>
<h4>membarrier()</h4>
<p>
<tt>membarrier()</tt> was first <a href="/Articles/369567/">discussed</a>
in 2010.  The initial use case was to support user-space RCU, which uses a
shared-memory variable to indicate that a thread is running in an RCU
critical section.  Changes to RCU-protected objects (and, in particular,
the freeing of the old version of a changed object) cannot happen while
any thread is in an RCU critical section, so code that performs such an
operation must 
check this shared flag to ensure that the change is safe.  This scheme can
be thwarted, though, if the processor reorders operations, causing the
object to be freed <i>before</i> the variable is checked.
<p>
Processors provide memory-barrier instructions so that this kind of
scenario can be prevented.  Unfortunately, these instructions are
relatively slow, since they must serialize access across the entire
machine.  Memory barriers must also occur in pairs to function properly; in
this case, one barrier would be needed whenever a thread sets the "in RCU
critical section" flag, while the other would happen after that flag is
checked, but before any subsequent action is taken.  This symmetric pairing
of barriers works well in many situations, but it is poorly suited to the
RCU use case in particular.
<p>
The problem comes from the fact that entry into an RCU critical section is
a frequent occurrence, while changes to RCU-protected objects can be
quite rare.  So it is possible that hundreds (or more)
<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> calls will be made where no thread is trying to
change the protected objects; in such cases, all of the overhead incurred
by those memory barriers is wasted.  In situations where this sort of
asymmetrical access pattern pertains, it would be worthwhile to greatly
increase the cost of a memory-barrier operation — if that cost could
be moved entirely to the thread performing the change, allowing the 
read path to be fast.
<p>
That is where <tt>membarrier()</tt> comes in.  The initial version simply
sent an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) causing every processor to execute
a memory-barrier instruction.  That approach was not entirely popular,
since the IPIs wake every processor on the system and can cause unexpected
latencies for realtime threads.  Subsequent discussion caused the
implementation to shift to calling <tt>synchronize_sched()</tt>, a kernel
function that, among other things, ensures that every processor will have
executed a memory barrier.  At the time, the patches included an
"expedited" option that would use IPIs instead, but when <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5b25b13ab08f616efd566347d809b4ece54570d1"><tt>membarrier()</tt>
was merged</a> (many years later, in 2015), that option was not
included.
<p>
<h4>The expedited option</h4>
<p>
Recently, Paul McKenney posted <a href="/Articles/728802/">a patch</a>
adding the expedited option back to <tt>membarrier()</tt>.  This change
raised some eyebrows, since the concerns about IPIs have not gone away.
Mathieu Desnoyers, the original author of the <tt>membarrier()</tt> patch,
<a href="/Articles/728803/">asked</a> how it was possible
to offer the expedited option without impacting realtime processes, and
Peter Zijlstra <a href="/Articles/728804/">worried</a> about the 
denial-of-service attack that can be carried out by code as simple as:
<p>
<pre>
    for (;;)
        membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED_EXPEDITED, 0);
</pre>
<p>
At the moment, it would seem, there are no new answers to any of those
questions, but there is a stronger incentive to add the expedited option,
and appears that this option is not creating any problems that do not
already exist.
<p>
As McKenney <a href="/Articles/728805/">described it</a>, there are a number
of users who are finding that the existing <tt>membarrier()</tt> system
call is too slow.  That is perhaps unsurprising;
<tt>synchronize_sched()</tt> will force the calling thread to block until
every CPU in the system goes through an RCU grace period, so there is a
certain amount of latency built in.  These users have found a trick to get
the desired behavior without calling <tt>membarrier()</tt>: they make a
call to either <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html"><tt>mprotect()</tt></a>
or <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>munmap()</tt></a>
instead.
Either of those system calls will, on an x86 system, cause an IPI to be
issued to ensure that the affected address ranges are removed from each
translation lookaside buffer (TLB).  They also cause a certain amount of
useless memory-management 
overhead but, evidently, the end result is still faster than calling
<tt>membarrier()</tt>.
<p>
Besides its fundamental inelegance, this approach has a couple of problems.
One is that it could easily break in future kernels or on future hardware
if those system calls can be made to work without IPIs; if such an
optimization opportunity presents itself, the kernel developers are highly
likely to take it.  In fact, the IPIs are not necessary on all current
hardware, leading McKenney to note that this trick "<q>has the slight
disadvantage of not working at all on arm and arm64</q>".  Adding the
IPI capability to <tt>membarrier()</tt> will allow for better performance
on all architectures without the need to resort to tricks.
<p>
Since users can already create IPIs at will with the memory-management
calls, McKenney does not believe that adding that ability to
<tt>membarrier()</tt> will make things worse.  But there are, he <a
href="/Articles/728808/">said</a>, a few 
things that could be done to reduce the potential for abuse of the
expedited option.  These range from complete "<q>defanging</q>" by
disabling expedited grace periods at boot time to limiting the number of
expedited <tt>membarrier()</tt> calls that can be made in a given time
period.  Various approaches to limiting the IPIs to the processors that
actually need to receive them (those processors actually running threads
from the application calling <tt>membarrier()</tt>) are also under
consideration.
Providing a mechanism for expedited barriers will, at least, give
the kernel community the possibility of handling any abuse.
<p>
This is a patch that is likely to go through further revisions and
discussion before it makes it close to the mainline.  Among other things,
the people who have been calling for a faster <tt>membarrier()</tt> need to
verify that the expedited option solves their problem.  "<q>Obviously,
unless there are good test results and some level of user enthusiasm, this
patch goes nowhere</q>", McKenney said.
The actual code, at the moment, fits on a single screen; the
discussion around it seems unlikely to be so concise.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This seems like the ideal approach; interrupting a CPU that's already running application code seems entirely fine. The DoS concerns all relate to the ability to interrupt a CPU that *isn't* running application code.<br>

      Remember, this is interrupting <i>processors</i>, not processes.  There is an ongoing conversation about sending IPIs only to processors that might be running a process that has that memory mapped, but that appears to not be an entirely easy thing to do on all architectures.

Thanks, that is expressed better than I managed.  I can see why this could be hard (who knows what all those other processors might be up to right now, or soon?) but a pessimistic approach would fail by interrupting all, which is what they are planning anyway.<br>
<p>
It takes so long to change mappings... maybe a list of processors that already have the page of interest mapped, that are favored to run processes that have used it lately? Maybe this sounds too much like Touching The Scheduler.<br>

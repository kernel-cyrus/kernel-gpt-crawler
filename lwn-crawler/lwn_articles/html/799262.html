<a href="/Articles/799060">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
The final sessions at the 2019 Linux Kernel Maintainers Summit covered a
number of relatively quick topics, including the "pull depth" for code
going into the mainline, the handling of hardware vulnerabilities, the ABI
status of tracepoints, and more.
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h4>Pull depth</h4>
<p>
In the discussion prior to the summit, James
Bottomley <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/1559836116.15946.27.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">noted</a>
that a lot of subsystem trees are pulled directly into the mainline by
Linus Torvalds.  He wondered whether that is a good thing, or whether
it might be better to have mid-level maintainers aggregating more pull
requests to increase the "pull depth" of lower-level trees and decrease the
load at the top.  Bottomley was not at the summit 
itself, but his topic was discussed there; the answer was that things are
mostly OK as they are.  (For the curious, a graphic showing the pull paths
for the 5.1 kernel can be found on <a href="/Articles/786656/">this page</a>.)
<p>
Torvalds responded to the question by saying that he loves to get large
pull requests from maintainers he trusts implicitly; that way, he can get a
lot of work into the mainline with little effort.  There is just one little
problem: there are few maintainers that he trusts to that degree.  In the
absence of that trust, he would prefer to get more, smaller requests that
are easier to review and easier to refuse if there is something wrong.  He
mentioned some subsystems in particular that have been problematic in the
past; bypassing the maintainer and getting more focused pull requests from
lower-level maintainers has improved the situation.  He is not happy about
having to do that, but it is better than the alternative, he said.
<p>
He does not, however, feel overworked by the number of trees he is pulling
now.  He aims to act on about 25 pull requests per day during the merge
window, normally spending about ten minutes on each of those.
<p>
There are advantages to having a maintainer hierarchy, though, that go
beyond reducing the number of pull requests at the top.  Dave Airlie
pointed out that it is a good way to train others to manage the subsystem
and know that others would be able to handle it.  Torvalds said that, with
many subsystems, he is not competent to review the patches himself; it is
good to have a mid-level maintainer who understands the area looking at
things.
<p>
One thing that can reduce his workload, Torvalds said, is getting
conflict-resolution trees from maintainers with their pull requests.  He
still generally wants to resolve merge conflicts himself, but it can be
helpful to see how the maintainer would do it.  He also gave some advice
for anybody wanting to sneak a feature in via a pull request: just delete a
lot of lines of code.  That makes Torvalds happy enough that he doesn't
look closely at the rest.
<p>
Olof Johansson said that the <a href="/Articles/437162/">problems with the
Arm architecture subsystem</a> back in 2011 would not have been solved
without Torvalds "roaring" about them.  Perhaps something similar is needed
to address other problematic subsystems, he said.
<p>
The session closed with linux-next maintainer Stephen Rothwell letting it
be known that he has been having a harder time than usual, with
sixteen-hour days being required to put linux-next together.  Why it is
taking so long is not entirely clear, though; he was not able to put his
finger on a specific cause.  He also advised the group that he would be
out and unable to work on linux-next during the 5.4 merge window.

<p>
<h4>Hardware vulnerabilities</h4>
<p>
The handling of hardware vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre was a
big topic at the <a href="/Articles/769417/">2018 Maintainers Summit</a>.
One year later, Thomas Gleixner gave a quick update on how the situation
has changed.
<p>
In the past year, he said, the community has, with luck, put together a
working set of processes for dealing with hardware-related problems.  He
said that "Intel is still trying to control things" in a number of ways,
but that the community has been pushing back.  There is <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ddaedbbece90add970faeac87f7d7d40341936ce">a
new document</a> in the kernel describing how the process should work; some
vendors are still quibbling about the details but, for the most part, this
process has been accepted by the industry.
<p>
The document includes a list of "ambassadors" who serve as a liaison
between specific companies and the community for dealing with hardware
bugs.  That list is slowly filling up.  Many company lawyers evidently see
the document as being a good thing; having the ground rules set down lets
everybody know how the whole process is expected to work.
<p>
So overall it seems that the community's processes for dealing with these
problems are in relatively good shape.  That said, Gleixner hopes that we
will never have to use those processes again â€” at least not until after he
retires.  There is "not much in the pipeline", which is a welcome bit of
news.
<p>

<h4>Tracepoints as ABI</h4>
<p>
There are some topics that the attendees of the Maintainers Summit are
happy to discuss; others provoke groans as soon as they are proposed.
For an example of the latter variety, consider the question of whether
kernel tracepoints can be seen as part of the user-space ABI, as raised by
Steve Rostedt.  This is a topic that has come around many times at these
events, but which has never seemingly been fully resolved to everybody's
satisfaction.
<p>
Torvalds repeated his viewpoint, which seems clear enough: if changing an
aspect of kernel behavior will cause user space to break, then that
behavior should be seen as part of the ABI.  Alexei Starovoitov pointed out
that tracepoints have changed in the past and the users of those
tracepoints have simply adapted to the change.  Torvalds answered that, if
somebody complains to him about a change like that, the change will be
reverted.
<p>
As a (post-summit) example of how seriously he takes this policy, consider
the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/72dbcf72156641fde4d8ea401e977341bfd35a05">final
commit</a> before the release of the 5.3 kernel.  An ext4 change made its
I/O rather more efficient; that meant fewer I/O interrupts during the early
boot process, generating less entropy for the random-number generator.  A
certain user-space setup then failed to boot properly because it blocked
waiting for entropy.  The ext4 change was reverted to avoid this problem
while a real solution is worked out.
<p>
Dave Miller pointed out that it is now easy to build BPF-based tools that
make use of kprobes â€” probes attached at run time to arbitrary points in
the kernel.  Some of these tools are widely used.  Torvalds responded that,
in that case, an ABI exists.  That led to a fair amount of concern, since
kprobes are entirely outside the control of the kernel community and could
end up freezing almost any part of the kernel's behavior.
<p>
Ted Ts'o pointed out that many subsystems have avoided adding tracepoints
out of the fear of creating ABI issues.  That drives tool developers to
resort to kprobes instead, perhaps making the problem even worse.  It
might, he suggested, be better to just add a few carefully thought-out
tracepoints where they are really needed.  Miller called the situation
ironic: the community is afraid that it has created software so useful that
people are actually using it.
<p>
Torvalds closed down the topic by reiterating that these discussions have
come around for years without any real change.  Over those years, there
have been almost no real problems resulting from tracepoints.  Why, he
asked, are we still discussing this issue?  He suggested that it should be
blacklisted as a topic at future summits.
<p>
<h4>Subsystem profiles</h4>
<p>
As the 2019 Maintainers Summit approached its end, Dan Williams briefly
raised the topic of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156821692280.2951081.18036584954940423225.stgit@dwillia2-desk3.amr.corp.intel.com/">subsystem
maintainer profile patches</a> he posted recently.  The purpose of these
patches is to document how specific subsystems work, making it easier for
developers to submit patches that follow the local rules.  Torvalds said
that the patches seem OK, but he would like to see some real users â€”
subsystems that actually document their workings using the proposed
mechanism.
<p>
I felt the need to point out that some developers oppose these patches,
claiming that they provide justification for subsystem maintainers who want
to create their own special rules.  That could take the kernel further away
from having more uniform processes, which most people think would be a good
thing.  Torvalds replied that these patches aren't creating that kind of
diversity; instead, they are simply "documenting reality".  Kees Cook, who
has done a lot of cross-tree work and has run into various local customs,
said that having this documentation in place would make his job easier.
<p>
And with that note, the summit adjourned for another year.

Tracepoints should not be ABI. Advertising them as such ensures they aren't added to the kernel and gives a false sense of security to user space. Unless, or course, the goal is to minimize in-kernel tracepoints to begin with.<br>

I guess the best way to describe what Linus said is that they are not an ABI, until they are.<br>
<p>
It's even worse now that if a tool can be built on a kprobe (dynamic tracepoint defined by a user, not a kernel developer), and the internal code changes, that, according to Linus, is now an ABI breakage, and the code that changed will be reverted!<br>

Yes, I gathered that part as well regarding the kprobes part of the discussion. And that's not just "inconvenient", as is the case for in-kernel tracepoints, but rather downright scary. In fact I'm willing to bet good money this approach is going to come to bite at some point in the future TBD. What happens when such internal code that needed changing contained a bug and there's no way to revert without reintroducing the bug? What if the code had to be obsoleted? etc.<br>
<p>
As the discussion is set up, however, it looks like the only thing that's going to cause a change of MO here is reality catching up with the presently broken MO.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; As the discussion is set up, however, it looks like the only thing that's going to cause a change of MO here is reality catching up with the presently broken MO.</font><br>

Exactly. As the topic is now blacklisted from further Maintainer Summits, the only way it will come back is when a real problem happens. Linus's entire point is "We haven't had an issue yet, so stop worrying about it". We need an issue to happen so that we can then rightfully complain to Linus.<br>

Hm, maybe I said that Linus needs to roar at other subsystems, but it's not what I intended to say and I'd definitely like to take any such request back.<br>
<p>
What I was trying to express was that the ARM cleanups wouldn't have happened unless things ended up reaching a breaking point with dire consequences on the horizon, and that some of the changes that might be beneficial w.r.t. people working closer together across company/subsystem boundaries in other areas might need some external motivation.<br>
<p>
I certainly didn't mean to encourage any kind of angry outbursts or yelling at people.<br>

           </div>
<p> The abstract goal of <a href="/Articles/524952/">containers</a> is, in
effect, to provide a group of processes with the illusion that that they
are the only processes on the system.  When fully implemented, this feature
has the potential to realize many practical benefits, such as light-weight
virtualization and <a href="/Articles/524952/">checkpoint/restore</a>.

<p> In order to give the processes in a container the illusion that there
are no other processes on the system, various global system resources must
be wrapped in abstractions that make it appear that each container has its
own instance of the resources.  This has been achieved by the addition of
"namespaces" for a number of global resources. Each namespace provides an
isolated view of a particular global resource to the set of processes that
are members of that namespace.

<p> Step by step, more and more global resources have been wrapped in
namespaces, and before we look at another step in this path it's worth
reviewing the progress to date.


<h4>Namespaces so far</h4>

<p> The <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/namespaces.php3">first step</a>
in the journey was mount namespaces, which can be used to provide a group
of processes with a private view of the mount points that make up the
filesystem hierarchy. Mount namespaces first appeared in the mainline
kernel in 2002, with the release of Linux 2.4.19.  The <tt>clone()</tt>
flag used to create mount namespaces was given the rather generic name
<tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt> for "new namespace", implying that no one was then
really considering the possibility that there might be other kinds of
namespaces; at that time, of course, containers were no more than a gleam
in the eyes of some developers.

<p> However, as the concept of containers took hold, a number of other
namespaces have followed.  <a href="/Articles/219794/">Network
namespaces</a> were added to provide a group of processes with a private
view of the network (network devices, IP addresses, IP routing tables, port
number space, and so on).  <a href="/Articles/259217/">PID namespaces</a>
isolated the global "PID number space" resource, so that processes in
separate PID namespaces can have the same PIDs&mdash;in particular, each
namespace can have its own 'init' (PID&nbsp;1), the "ancestor of all
processes". PID namespaces also allow techniques such as freezing the
processes in a container and then restoring them on another system while
maintaining the same PIDs.

<p> Several other global resources have likewise been wrapped in
namespaces, so that there are also <a href="/Articles/187274/">IPC
namespaces</a> (initially implemented to isolate System&nbsp;V IPC identifiers
and <a href="/Articles/312232/">later</a> to isolate instances of the
virtual filesystems used in the implementation of POSIX message queues) and
<a href="/Articles/179345/">UTS namespaces</a> (which wrap the
<tt>nodename</tt> and <tt>domainname</tt> identifiers returned by <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html"><tt>uname(2)</tt></a>).
Work on one of the more complex namespaces, <a
href="/Articles/491310/">user namespaces</a>, was started in about Linux
2.6.23 and seems to be <a href="/Articles/525709/">edging</a> towards
completion. When complete, user namespaces will allow per-namespace mappings
of user and group IDs, so that, for example, it will be possible for a process
to be root inside a container without having root privileges in the system
as a whole. 

<p> Of course, a Linux system has a large number of global resources, each
of which could conceivably be wrapped in a namespace.  At the more extreme
end, for example, even a resource such as the system time could be wrapped,
so that different containers could maintain different concepts of the
time. (A time namespace was <a href="/Articles/180375/">once proposed</a>,
but the implementation was not merged.)  The trick is to determine the
minimum set of resources that need to be wrapped for the <i>practical</i>
implementation of containers. (Of course, this "minimum set" may well grow
over time, as people develop new uses for containers.) A related question
is how those wrappings should be grouped so as to avoid an explosion of
namespaces that would increase application complexity. So, for example,
System&nbsp;V IPC and POSIX message queues could conceivably have been
wrapped in different namespaces, but the kernel developers concluded that
it makes practical sense to group them in a single "IPC" namespace.


<h4>The global kernel log problem</h4>

<p> What is necessary for the practical implementation of containers
sometimes only becomes clear when one starts doing, well, practical
things. Thus, it was that in early 2010 Jean-Marc Pigeon <a
href="/Articles/527372/">reported</a> that he had written a small utility
to build containers using the <tt>clone()</tt> system call that worked
fine, except that "<q>HOST and all containers share the SAME /proc/kmsg,
meaning kernel syslog information are scrambled (useless)</q>".

<p> What Jean-Marc was discovering is that the kernel log is one of the
global resources that is not wrapped in a namespace. He went on to note
another ill-effect: "<q>I have in iptables, reject packet logging on the
HOST, [but as soon as] rsyslog is started on one container, I can't see my
reject packet log any more.</q>" In other words, starting a
<tt>syslog</tt> daemon on the host or any container sucks up all of the
kernel log messages produced on the host or in any container. The point
here about <tt>iptables</tt> is particularly relevant: the inability to
isolate kernel log messages from <tt>iptables</tt> is a significant
practical problem when trying to employ the network namespaces facility
that the kernel already provides.

<p> In response to Jean-Marc's question about how the problem could be
fixed, Serge Hallyn <a href="/Articles/527383/">replied</a>:

<div class="BigQuote">

Well, the results of do_syslog() should be containerized.  Kernel messages (oopses for
instance) should always go to the initial container.  Shouldn't be hard to
do, but the question is what do we tie it to?  User namespace?  Network
namespace?  &hellip; I'm tempted to say userns makes the most sense - if
you start a new userns you likely always want private syslog, whereas with
netns and pidns you may not.

</div>

<p> <tt>do_syslog()</tt> is the kernel function that encapsulates the main
logic of the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html"><tt>syslog(2)</tt></a>
system call.  That system call retrieves messages from the kernel log ring
buffer (and performs a range of control operations on the log buffer) that
is populated by messages created using the kernel's <tt>printk()</tt>
function. Thus, though discussions on this topic have tended to use the
term "syslog namespace", that is something of a misnomer: what is really
meant is wrapping the kernel log resource in a namespace.

<p> To avoid possible confusion, it is probably worth noting that the
<tt>syslog(2)</tt> system call is a quite different thing from the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html"><tt>syslog(3)</tt></a>
library function, which writes messages to the UNIX domain datagram socket
(<tt>/dev/log</tt>) from which the user-space syslog daemon
(<tt>rsyslogd</tt> or similar) retrieves messages. (Because of this
collision of names, the GNU C library exposes the <tt>syslog(2)</tt> system
call under a quite different name: <tt>klogctl()</tt>.) A picture helps
clarify things:

<blockquote>

logging primitives]">

</blockquote>


<h4>First attempts at a solution</h4>

<p> In the event, "containerizing" <tt>do_syslog()</tt> turned out to be
more difficult than Serge thought. His <a href="/Articles/527386/">first
shot</a> at addressing the problem (a "gross hack" to "<q>provide each
user namespace with its own syslog ring buffer</q>") quickly uncovered
<a href="/Articles/527388/">a further difficulty</a>: the kernel's
<tt>printk()</tt> is sometimes called in contexts where there is no way to
determine in which of the per-namespace ring buffers a message should be
logged.  For example, if the kernel is executing a network interrupt (to
process an incoming network packet) and wants to log a message, that
message should <i>not</i> be sent to the per-namespace kernel log of the
interrupted process. Rather, the message should be sent to the kernel log
associated with the network namespace for the network device; however,
the kernel data structures provide no way to obtain a reference to that
kernel log.  

<p> Jean-Marc himself also made <a href="/Articles/527406/">an attempt</a>
at implementing a solution. However, Serge <a
href="/Articles/527409/">pointed out</a> that Jean-Marc's patch suffered
some of the same problems as his own earlier attempt. Serge went on to
describe what he thought would be the correct solution, which would require
the creation of a separate syslog namespace. His proposed solution can be
paraphrased as follows:

<ol>

<p>
<li>The core of <tt>vprintk_emit()</tt> (which contains most of
implementation of the <tt>printk()</tt> function) should be moved into
a new <tt>nsvprintk_emit()</tt> function that takes an argument that specifies a
syslog namespace.

<p>
<li> <tt>vprintk_emit()</tt> would then become a wrapper around
<tt>nsvprintk_emit()</tt> that specifies the "initial" syslog namespace
(i.e., the syslog namespace of the host system).

<p> <li> A namespace-aware version of <tt>printk()</tt>, called (say)
<tt>nsprintk()</tt>, should be created. That function would take a syslog
namespace argument and pass it to <tt>nsvprintk_emit()</tt>.

<p>
<li>The kernel log ring buffer should be "containerized" as per Serge's
initial patch. Thus each syslog namespace would have its own ring buffer,
and <tt>syslog(2)</tt> would operate on the per-namespace ring buffer of
the calling process.

<p>
<li>At call sites in the kernel code where it is not appropriate to use the
syslog namespace of the currently executing process, calls to
<tt>printk()</tt> should be replaced with calls to <tt>nsprintk()</tt> that
pass a suitable syslog namespace argument. 

</ol>


<!--

<div class="BigQuote">

I think my patch is fundamentally wrong anyway: we should not
use current's context at vprintk like i did.  We should use an
optional passed-in context from those callsites where we want to,
and default to init otherwise.  That means

<p>
1. put the core of vprintk() into vnsprintk() which takes a syslog
namespace as argument

<p> 2. make vprintk() a wrapper around vnsprintk() which passes in
init_syslog_ns [a handle for the syslog namespace of the host system] to
vnsprintk().  printk can remain unchanged.

<p>
4. make nsprintk() a wrapper around vnsprintk() which takes a syslog
ns argument and pass it to vnsprintk()

<p> 
3. do_syslog() can obviously be containerized the same way it
is now.

<p>
4. take a printk call like the iptables ones you want and turn
it into nsprintk syscall.
</div>

-->

<p> Although Jean-Marc made a few more efforts to rework his patch in the
following weeks, the effort ultimately petered out without much further
comment or consensus on a solution. It seems that Serge and <a
href="/Articles/527411/">other kernel developers</a> realized that the
problem was more complex than first thought and they had neither the time
to implement a solution themselves nor to help Jean-Marc toward
implementing a solution. 

<p> The main difficulty lies in the last of the points above, and its
solution was not really elaborated in Serge's mail. The kernel data
structures and code need to be modified to add suitable hooks to handle the
"no current process context problem"&mdash;the cases where
<tt>printk()</tt> is called from a context in which the currently executing
process can't be used to identify a suitable syslog namespace to which a
message should be logged.


<h4>Restarting work on a solution</h4>

<p> Work in this area then seems to have gone quiet for more than two
years, until a few days ago when Serge proposed <a
href="/Articles/525629/">a new proof-of-concept patch set</a>, pretty much
along the lines he described two years earlier. His description of the
patch noted that:

<div class="BigQuote">

The syslog ns is tied to a user
namespace.  You must create a new user namespace before you can create a
new sylog ns.  The syslog ns is created through a new command (11) to
the __NR_syslog system call.

<p>
Once a task enters a new syslog ns, it's "dmesg", "dmesg -c" and /dev/kmsg
actions affect only itself, so that user-created syslog messages no longer
are confusingly combined in the host's syslog.

</div>

<p>
In other words, Serge's patch provides isolation for the kernel log by
implementing a new dedicated namespace for that purpose (rather than
providing the isolation by attaching the implementation to one of the
existing namespaces). Each syslog namespace instance would be tied to a
particular user namespace.

<p> Normally, new namespaces of each type are created by suitable flags to
the <tt>clone()</tt> system call. Thus, for example, there are clone flags
such as <tt>CLONE_NEWUTS</tt> and <tt>CLONE_NEWUSER</tt>.  However, a while
ago, the kernel developers realized that the flag space for
<tt>clone()</tt> was exhausted. (Providing additional flag space was one of
the motivations behind the <a href="/Articles/362371/">proposal</a> to add
an <tt>eclone()</tt> system call, a proposal that was ultimately
unsuccessful.) For this reason, Serge proposed instead to use a new command
to the <tt>syslog()</tt> system call to create syslog namespace instances.

<p>
Serge went on to note:

<div class="BigQuote">

"printk" itself always goes
to the initial syslog_ns, and consoles belong only to the initial
syslog_ns.  However printks relating to a specific network namespace, for
instance, can now be targeted to the syslog ns for the user ns which owns
the network ns, aiding in debugging in a container.

</div>

<p> Serge's patch would solve the "no current process context problem" as
follows. As noted above, this case is handled by an
<tt>nsprintk()</tt>-style function that takes an argument (of type
<tt>struct&nbsp;syslog_ns&nbsp;*)</tt> that identifies the syslog namespace
to which the log message should be sent. The value for that argument can be
obtained via the <tt>struct&nbsp;net</tt> structure for the network
namespace instance: in the current user namespace implementation (<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git">git
tree</a>), when a network namespace is created using <tt>clone()</tt>, a
pointer to the corresponding user namespace instance of the caller is
stored in the <tt>net</tt> structure. Serge's patch in turn provides a
linkage from that user namespace structure to the corresponding syslog
namespace.

<p> Eric Biederman, the maintainer of the user namespace git tree, <a
href="/Articles/527669/">agreed</a> with Serge's overall approach, but
queried one particular point:

<div class="BigQuote">

I am not a fan of how this ties into the user namespace.  I would prefer
closer or looser ties.  The recursive reference count loop where a userns
refers to a syslogns and that syslogns refers to the same userns is
unpleasant.

</div>

<p> In Serge's implementation, the syslog and user namespaces are
maintained as separate structures, but, as the recursive pointers between
the two namespace structures and the need to create a new user namespace
before creating a syslog namespace indicate, instances of each namespace
are not truly independent.  In Eric's view then, the syslog and user
namespace structures should either be more fully decoupled, or they should
be much more tightly coupled.

<p> Eric went on later to <a href="/Articles/527671/">note</a> that:

<div class="BigQuote">

There is an argument to be made that syslog messages are the kind of
security identifiers like uid, gids, and keys that should be part of a user
namespace.  I'm not fully convinced but there are some DOS attacks that
would naturally prevent.

</div>

<p> The discussion ultimately led Serge to <a
href="/Articles/527673/">conclude</a> that the syslog resource should
instead be grouped as part of the user namespace rather than as a separate
namespace:

<div class="BigQuote">

I can't really think of a good case for not putting the syslogns straight
into the userns (i.e. not having a separate syslogns), so I'd say let's go
that route.

</div>

<p> Serge's patch seems to have inspired another group to try implementing
syslog namespaces. A couple of days after Serge's patch, Rui Xiang <a
href="/Articles/525728/">posted</a> some patches that he and his colleague
Libo Chen had developed to implement similar functionality. Rui began by
noting a couple of the obvious differences in their patch set:

<div class="BigQuote">

In Serge's patch [...] syslog_namespace was tied to a user namespace. We add
syslog_ns tied to nsproxy instead, and implement ns_printk in ip_table
context.

<p> We add syslog_namespace as a part of nsproxy, and a new flag
CLONE_SYSLOG to unshare syslog area.

</div>

<p> Using <tt>nsproxy</tt> is the conventional way of dealing with the
namespaces associated with a process: it is a structure that contains
pointers to structures describing each of the namespaces that a process is
associated with.  This contrasts with Serge's original approach, which hung
the syslog namespace off the user namespace.

<p> Rui's team also took advantage of a detail that Serge perhaps
overlooked: there happens to be one spare bit in the flag space for
<tt>clone()</tt> because the <tt>CLONE_STOPPED</tt> flag was removed
several kernel releases ago. Therefore, Rui's team repurposed that
bit. Normally, it would not be safe to recycle flag bits in this way, but
the <tt>CLONE_STOPPED</tt> flag has a special history. It was initially
proposed for use specifically in the NPTL threading implementation, but the
final implementation abandoned the flag in favor of a different
approach. As such, <tt>CLONE_STOPPED</tt> is likely never to have had
serious user-space users.

<p> Unsurprisingly, the overall approaches of the two patch sets have many
similarities, but there are differences in details such as how a syslog
namespace is associated with a <tt>struct&nbsp;net</tt> in order to solve
the "no current process context problem".

<p> Although kernel flame wars between competing implementations are what
often make the biggest headlines in the online press, the subsequent
exchange between Serge, Rui, and Libo demonstrated that life on developer
mailing lists is usually more cordial. Serge <a
href="/Articles/527717/">asked</a>:

<div class="BigQuote">

I understand that user namespaces aren't 100% usable yet, but looking
long term, is there a reason to have the syslog namespace separate
from user namespace?

</div>

<p>
In response, <a href="/Articles/527718/">Rui</a> noted:

<div class="BigQuote">

Actually we don't have strong preference. We'll think more about it. Hope
we can make consensus with Eric.

</div>

<p> That in turn led Serge to <a href="/Articles/527722/">ask</a> Rui and
Libo if his patch set might suffice for their needs, with the gracious note
that:

<div class="BigQuote">

I'm not at all wedded to my patchset.  I'm happy to go with something else
entirely.  My set was just a proof of concept.

</div>

<p> There is one other notable difference in functionality between the two
patch sets. In Serge's patch set, system consoles belonged (by intention)
only to the <i>initial</i> syslog namespace, meaning that kernel log
messages from other syslog namespace instances can't be displayed on
consoles. By contrast, Rui and Libo's patches include consoles in the
syslog namespace, so that kernel messages from syslog namespaces other than
the initial namespace can be displayed on consoles. Rui and Libo would like
this functionality in order to be able to obtain kernel log messages from
containers when monitoring embedded devices that provide access to the
console over a serial port.

<p> The summary of the discussion is that there are useful pieces in
both patches. Serge <a href="/Articles/527729/">plans</a> to revise his
patch to merge the syslog namespace functionality into user namespaces, add
the console functionality desired by Rui and Libo, and add some in-kernel
uses of the namespace-aware <tt>printk()</tt> interface as a
proof-of-concept for the implementation (as was done in the patches by Rui
and Libo).


<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>

<p> The history of the work to provide syslog namespaces (or as it might
better be termed, namespace isolation for the kernel log) presents a
microcosm of work on namespaces in general. As has often been the case, the
implementation of namespaces often turns out to be surprisingly
complex. Much of that complexity hinges on detailed questions of
functionality (for example, the behavior of consoles in this case) and the
question of whether resources should be grouped inside a new namespace or
within an existing namespace.  In the case of syslog namespaces, it looks
like a number of decisions have been made; there will probably be a few
more rounds of patches, but there seems to be general consensus on the
direction forward. Thus, there is a reasonable chance that proper namespace
isolation of kernel logging will appear in the kernel sometime around Linux
3.9 or soon afterward.

It seems to me that all of this assumes only one namespace could be relevant to any given printk. I don't think that's a safe assumption -- it might be that multiple namespaces with differing user/syslog namespaces are relevant to the same printk. What should happen then?<br>

Possibly w/ multiple nsprintk() calls, specifying all of the relevant namespaces (1 in each call).  Assuming you can identify them... but hopefully that wouldn't be difficult (if it's not possible, then maybe it is a safe assumption that the message is only relevant to one namespace).<br>

Couldn't this be simpler and more flexible by combining the structured syslog messages patch and an user-space filter?<br>
<p>
Something like having a single kernel ring buffer (like now), that a single daemon would listen to, but have per namespace buffers that would be feed by  that daemon according with user-space rules.<br>

That's a really good point, if the log is a JSON structure, add a tag section that tells you all the possible namespace info, and then you can have a program filter it and distribute it to one or more destinations.<br>
<p>
I would say that this filtering should probably be happening in userspace, where the tools like rsyslog already support very extensive logic for doing this.<br>
<p>
This includes the ability to deliver to additional copies of rsyslog that are running inside your namespace containers<br>

The problem there is information disclosure - there may well be various pieces of information you don't want a container to see, and a userspace filter inside of said container can't do that.<br>

Ah, looks like I misread your statement, and you were suggesting that the initial namespace's syslog daemon would redispatch to containers. That makes more sense, but it also increases the maintenance burden - you need a way of mapping the tags to the delivery endpoint of the syslog daemon in the container, and it still will be apparent that the source is an external syslog daemon (tcp, udp, what have you) rather than fulfilling the stated goal of the container appearing to be a fully isolated system.<br>

You will already need to do that if you do it on the kernel, and it would be more difficult to modify the mapping (and puts policy on the kernel). The only difference is the kernel now doesn't need to have a default policy (it doesn't break anything because it's a new feature). The default can just be that all containers start in the same "syslog" namespace (like now).<br>
<p>
As for not being transparent, I'm talking of a ring-buffer per container, so it's fully transparent for the applications. dmesg will output the namespace ring-buffer contents.<br>
<p>
The initial namespace "syslog" daemon would dispatch messages from the unfiltered ring-buffer to the other namespaces ring-buffers. The difference would be that the syslog(2) syscall would be namespace aware and return messages only from the current namespace ring-buffer.<br>

Hi, <br>
I am currently using chroot jails and  network namespace combination. I am executing my syslog in both my root as well as in my chroot environment. In this case should the kernel logging messages be jail specific? I can sometimes see the kernel messages inside my chroot jail, and most of the times not. (for example making the interface up or down). <br>
<p>
Interfaces mapped to a namespace of a chroot jail, the kernel logging happens in the default root and not in the chroot. (Is this behaviour in conjunction to the problem mentioned in your article? ).<br>
<p>
Please let me know your views. <br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>

Kernel 3.9.4<br>
Still same problem, container iptable logs  go to host OR  container, seems to be a round robin distribution, same for HOST  iptable logs (HOST syslog reaching container! this NOT good at all). Note: openvz kernel do not have this issue for a very long time now (I would say 6 years).<br>

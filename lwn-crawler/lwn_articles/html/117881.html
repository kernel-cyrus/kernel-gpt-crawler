<h1>Faster page faulting through prezeroing</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 5, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
In early December, this page <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/114596/">covered</a> Christoph Lameter's
efforts to speed up the page fault mechanism by reducing lock contention.
That work speeds things significantly on multiprocessor systems, but is of
little help to uniprocessor users.  That is not true of Christoph's other
page fault work, which can benefit users on all systems.  
<p>

Christoph <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/117794/">notes</a> that, once
the locking issues are taken care of, the most expensive part of the page
fault handler is the code which zeroes anonymous pages before handing them
to the faulting process.  He has concluded that, in some situations,
performance can be significantly improved by clearing those pages ahead of
time and having them ready when the page fault happens.  Just zeroing pages
ahead of time is not particularly helpful - it is mostly an exercise in
moving work around to different places in the system.  But, if (1)&nbsp;the
zeroing of pages can be made more efficient, and (2)&nbsp;the workload is
of the right type, things can be made quite a bit faster.

<p>
What is the right kind of workload?  For the purposes of this patch set,
the best workload is one which allocates whole pages, but then only touches
parts of them.  If those pages are already cleared, there is no need to
load an entire page into the processor cache when it is faulted in.  The
improved cache behavior, along with the speedup in fault handling itself,
can yield big improvements.  Some figures posted by Christoph show an
almost 4x improvement in the page fault rate in the right conditions.  As
it turns out, many applications fit this profile, so "the right conditions"
should not be all that rare.
<p>

There are four parts to the prezeroing patch set.  <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/117795/">The first patch</a> extends the page
allocation mechanism to make it explicitly handle requests for zeroed
memory.  There is a new <tt>__GFP_ZERO</tt> allocation flag which tells
<tt>alloc_pages()</tt> (and thus functions like <tt>__get_free_page()</tt> and
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>) to return zeroed memory. Many places in the
kernel which clear their own pages have been fixed to request zeroed memory
instead.  With only this patch applied, the kernel's code is cleaned up a
bit, but no performance improvements result - the <tt>__GFP_ZERO</tt> flag
just causes a call to <tt>clear_page()</tt> in the page allocator.
<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/117796/">The second patch</a> changes the
prototype of the <tt>clear_page()</tt> function to:
<p>
<pre>
    void clear_page(void *page, int order);
</pre>
<p>
With the new interface, <tt>clear_page()</tt> can zero higher-order pages.
This change is an important part of the patch set: pages are most
efficiently zeroed if they can be done in larger groups.  Often, the setup
cost is a big part of the total; the value of prezeroing pages is much
reduced if it can only be done one page at a time.
<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/117797/">The kscrubd patch</a> is where
things start to get interesting.  This patch expands the <tt>zone</tt>
structure so that it can keep track of pages which are known to be clear.
Requests for zeroed pages are satisfied from this list when possible.  A
new kernel thread (actually, a set of per-node threads) wakes up
occasionally and clears pages for future allocation.  This thread does not
normally scrub zero-order (single) pages, but can be configured to do so
(via <tt>/proc</tt>) if desired.

<p>
The kscrubd patch also implements a linked list of "zero drivers," being
functions which can be called upon to zero pages efficiently.  There are no
such drivers in this patch, so all pages are zeroed with a call to
<tt>clear_page()</tt>, which, as a comment in the code notes, can be hard
on the processor's cache.  It would be nicer if pages could be zeroed
without the cache impacts.  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/117798/">The
fourth patch</a> shows how this can be done - at least, on Altix systems.
It adds a driver for the Altix block transfer engine which can zero memory
directly without the processor's involvement - at least, when relatively
large chunks of memory are involved.  Drivers for other hardware have not
yet been posted, but it would not be surprising to see them begin to appear
after the prezeroing code has been merged.
<p>
And that could happen soon: 
Linus, having been convinced by Christoph's results, has <a
href="/Articles/117888/">requested</a> that this set of patches be merged
soon.  So prezeroing could even find its way into the kernel prior to the
2.6.11 release.  (<b>Update</b>: the <tt>__GFP_ZERO</tt> patch was merged
just as LWN was being published).<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I don't get it. The what happens when kscrubd wakes up and clears the pages? Yup, it brings the memory into cache and might get evicted before someone needs it.<br>
<p>
I am not convinced this is a useful feature. It looks more like something that only works for one particular (possibly artificially designed) benchmark.<br>

<p>
  Maybe that is not the job of the processor to clear the page, for instance kscrubd function can do a IDE DMA read on the disk of a pre-zeroed area. Then the processor cache is not touched (could be marked dirty but...). That pre-zeroed area could be some reserved blocks at the end of the swap partition, or a contigous file.<br>
<p>
  Another clean solution is available on non ia32 processor, being write and invalidate instruction: when the first byte of a cache line is written (to zero), the complete cache line is not first read from memory.<br>
  IMHO, when the repeat counter (in register %ecx) is bigger than the cache line, assembly instruction "rep stosl" still do not produce a write and invalidate transaction to external memory on ia32.<br>

      I didn't the code. What I guess is that kscrubd can zero'ed a lot of pages once, then it can save some unnecessary cache eviction.<br>

      Another small thing is: when context switching between processes, anyway, the cache lines may be filled by new ones, so kscrubd will not add much cache pollution. But page fault handling is a synchronous operation and after that  you still are in the same context. In that case, cache pollution is bad.<br>

      I think the idea is not so much to prevent cache trashing, which is after all inevitable, but to make it happen less often. If kswapd pre-zeroes a big sack of pages, then that's more efficient than zeroing them one at a time. And of course if the hardware can be persuaded to zero chunks of RAM without touching the processor cache, then you've got a huge win.<br>
<p>
In a couple of years it might even be possible to buy a PCI Express "/dev/null" card to accelerate your server.<br>

      2+ years ago, I wrote: <i>In a couple of years it might even be possible to buy a PCI Express "/dev/null" card to accelerate your server.</i>
<p>
Unfortunately, this did not happen. As someone pointed out in another thread, it's possible to persuade various DMA-capable hardware to act as a /dev/null device. For example, you can stick a page full of zeroes on the swap device and then get the IDE controller to DMA it to wherever its needed. Provided the drive's cache is larger than the page size, the performance should be acceptable.
<p>
The problem being that most of the devices on the system are already busy with their intended function, like reading and writing files, and cannot expend time in the frivolous pursuit of nullage.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 28, 2022</br>
           </div>
There is a long and growing list of options for getting information out of
the kernel but, in the real world, print statements still tend to be the
tool of choice. The kernel's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/printk-basics.html?highlight=printk#c.printk"><tt>printk()</tt></a>
function 
often comes up short, despite the fact that it provides a set of
kernel-specific features, so there has, for some time,  been interest in
better APIs for textual output from the kernel.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220421234837.3629927-1-kent.overstreet@gmail.com/">"printbuf"
proposal</a> from Kent Overstreet is one step in that direction, but will
need some changes to make it work well with features the kernel already
has. 
<p>
A call to <tt>printk()</tt> works well when kernel code needs to output a
simple line of text.  It is not as convenient when there is a need for
complex formatting or when multiple lines of output must be generated.  It
is possible to use multiple <tt>printk()</tt> calls for even a single line
of text, just as it is with <tt>printf()</tt> in user space, but there is a
problem: the kernel is a highly concurrent environment, and anything can
happen between successive <tt>printk()</tt> calls, including
<tt>printk()</tt> calls from other contexts.  That results in intermixed
output, often described with technical terms like "garbled", that can be
painful to make sense of.
<p>
<h4>Printbuf</h4>
<p>
An answer to that problem is to assemble the complex output in memory, then
to print it in a single operation.  That is where printbufs come in.  A
printbuf is a simple structure containing a pointer to a <tt>char</tt>
buffer and some housekeeping information, including the length of that
buffer and how much of it contains valid data.  Kernel code can set up a
printbuf with something like:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/printbuf.h&gt;

    struct printbuf buf = PRINTBUF;
</pre>
<p>
<tt>PRINTBUF</tt> is a simple structure initializer that zeroes the entire
thing.
There is then a whole set of functions that will append text information to
the buffer, including:
<p>
<pre>
    void pr_buf(struct printbuf *buf, const char *fmt, ...);
    void pr_char(struct printbuf *buf, char c);
    void pr_newline(struct printbuf *buf);
    void pr_human_readable_u64(struct printbuf *buf, u64 v);
    void pr_human_readable_s64(struct printbuf *buf, s64 v);
    void pr_time(struct printbuf *buf, u64);
    /* ... */
</pre>
<p>
<tt>pr_buf()</tt> works like <tt>printk()</tt>, except that the resulting
text ends up in <tt>buf</tt> rather than going directly to the system log.
Many 
other functions exist for adding specific types of data to the buffer, 
some of which is shown above.  At any time, the accumulated text can be
found in <tt>buf.buf</tt>, which can be passed to <tt>printk()</tt> to output
the whole buffer in a single call.  When a printbuf is no longer needed, it
should be passed to <tt>printbuf_exit()</tt> to free its resources.
<p>
Missing from this discussion so far is any mention of memory management.
The printbuf code handles that; it allocates the string buffer, and
reallocates it to a larger size whenever it threatens to overflow.  Those
allocations are done at the <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> priority, though printbuf
can use <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> if the <tt>atomic</tt> field in the structure
is set to a true value.  If an allocation fails, the code will make a note
of it but will continue, dropping some output but preserving what it can.
<p>
When Overstreet first <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220419203202.2670193-1-kent.overstreet@gmail.com/">posted</a>
this code in mid-April, one of the first comments was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yl+T3Mx408HiC6dS@infradead.org/">a one-liner from
Christoph Hellwig</a> asking: "<q>How does this use case differ from
that of lib/seq_buf.c?</q>"  Overstreet, it seems, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220420051854.qioq4nt4dejpnip6@moria.home.lan/">was
unaware</a> of the seq_buf mechanism and, as a consequence, had
reimplemented much of it.  His response was to propose replacing seq_buf
entirely with his new implementation.
<p>
<h4>Seq_buf</h4>
<p>
Seq_buf was first <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3a161d99c43c">added
to the kernel</a> for the  3.19 release in 2014.  It is meant to
solve essentially the same problem, though the approach taken is a little
different.  A seq_buf uses a static buffer allocated by the caller;
initialization looks something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/seq_buf.h&gt;

    char buf[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    struct seq_buf seq;

    seq_buf_init(&amp;seq, buf, MY_BUFFER_SIZE);
</pre>
<p>

The process of generating output in a seq_buf is strikingly similar to the
approach used for printbuf; there is a familiar-looking series of
functions, including:
<p>
<pre>
    int seq_buf_printf(struct seq_buf *s, const char *fmt, ...);
    extern int seq_buf_puts(struct seq_buf *s, const char *str);
    extern int seq_buf_putc(struct seq_buf *s, unsigned char c);
    extern int seq_buf_putmem(struct seq_buf *s, const void *mem,
    			      unsigned int len);
    /* ... */
</pre>
<p>
Sending the contents of a seq_buf to the log is a simple matter of calling
<tt>printk()</tt> with the previously allocated buffer.  This API also
includes functions like <tt>seq_buf_to_user()</tt>, which will copy the
contents of a seq_buf into user space.  On the other hand, it lacks some of
the fancier formatting features provided by the printbuf mechanism.
Arguably, though, the biggest difference between the two interfaces is the
automatic memory management done by printbuf.  A seq_buf can run out of
space but, in the absence of allocation failures, a printbuf never will.
<p>
<h4>Reconciling the two</h4>
<p>
There would appear to be agreement that the printbuf submission brings some
useful features, but there is little
interest in having two subsystems in the kernel that do the same job.  So
it is not surprising that Overstreet was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220422042017.GA9946@lst.de/">advised</a> to set
printbuf aside and, instead, add any needed capabilities to seq_buf.
Steve Rostedt, who wrote the original seq_buf code, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220422113736.460058cc@gandalf.local.home/">offered</a>
to help with that task.
<p>
Overstreet <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220422193015.2rs2wvqwdlczreh3@moria.home.lan/">was
not thrilled</a> with that idea, though:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Printbuf is the more evolved, more widely used implementation, and
	you're asking me to discard it so the kernel can stick with its
	more primitive, less widely used implementation.
</blockquote>
<p>
The "more widely used" claim raised some eyebrows, given that printbuf is
not in the kernel and thus, with regard to the mainline, not used at all.
He was, it seems, counting uses in his own, out-of-tree, bcachefs code — an
argument that tends to carry little weight in the kernel community.
<p>
Meanwhile, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220419203202.2670193-4-kent.overstreet@gmail.com/">a
patch adding printbuf use in the memory-management subsystem</a> drew <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yl+vHJ3lSLn5ZkWN@dhcp22.suse.cz/">questions</a> from
Michal Hocko, who was not convinced of the value of the new output
that it generates.  He later also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YmKd2iHTHuzaTkE6@dhcp22.suse.cz/">raised
concerns</a> on the use of dynamic memory allocation for logging from the
memory-management subsystem.  When trying to log information about, for
example, an out-of-memory situation, attempting to allocate more memory
tends not to end well; at best it will dip into the final memory reserves
that should be dedicated to the task of freeing memory.
<p>
The conversations continued over a few different thread branches, and got
somewhat adversarial in a few of them.  Overstreet made it clear, with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220422203057.iscsmurtrmwkpwnq@moria.home.lan/">references</a>
to "not-invented-here syndrome" and such, that he was not 
pleased with the reception given to his code.
It began to look like one of those threads that
leads to the developer involved walking away from the kernel community
altogether.
<p>
Hopefully that is not how this discussion will end, though.
The memory-management logging topic will have a session at the upcoming <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">Linux Storage, Filesystem,
and Memory-Management Summit</a>.  Meanwhile, Overstreet did eventually <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220422215146.i663tn6zzn6blzo3@moria.home.lan/">come
to agree</a> that implementing his features on top of the existing seq_buf
code might be a viable path forward.  Assuming that this direction works
out, it could lead to the kind of resolution that the kernel community
normally strives for: the incorporation of useful new features without
duplicating mechanisms that the kernel already supports.  The proof will be
in the updated patch sets, if and when they are posted.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Dynamic memory allocation seems to be a bit of an overkill for such a feature. Usually users would have a rough estimate about how much buffer space will be needed. It can then often be cheaply allocated on the stack.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the seq_buf boilerplate (two variables and seq_buf_init) seems a bit verbose.<br>
That should be combined into a macro for an easy to use on-stack use case.<br>

If you have a fixed stack size with known begin and end pointers, then you&#x27;d just have to subtract SP from the end pointer.<br>

<p>
It&#x27;s even more complex than that. Depending on the architecture, if you are in interrupt context, you may be on a different stack that is even a different size than the normal context stack. This would require an architecture dependent implementation.<br>

Yeah, well. For the usual log messages you need 100? 200? bytes of temporary memory.<br>
And if you need more, then it would probably be a good idea to have dynamic allocation as a second option or use a static allocation.<br>
<p>
Just saying that I doubt dynamic allocation is a good trade off for the majority of use cases.<br>
<p>
(And wasn&#x27;t there work on getting a dynamic kernel stack? I&#x27;m not sure what state that is in.)<br>

On the other hand statically guessing a required size will probably end up wasting more memory in the vast majority of the cases that do not use the peak amount of memory used in that code-path for all the code-paths where the length of the message varies significantly.<br>

Maybe it is not too bad if you constraint your guess to the OOM management code paths. The rest of the code can still allocate dynamically.<br>

Is it possible to have an &#x27;early&#x27; set aside amount of memory, and then try to allocate more if needed and if it fails send a &#x27;truncated&#x27; set of the output in the set-aside memory? That way if you run out you can still print something as a fall back? [And from this the try_alloc() call was written.. where we try to allocate but if its not there, meh.]<br>

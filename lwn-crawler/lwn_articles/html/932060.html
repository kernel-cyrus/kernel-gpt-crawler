<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
There are some filesystems that use the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html">Filesystem
in Userspace</a> (FUSE) framework but only to provide a different view of
an underlying filesystem, such as different file
metadata, a changed directory hierarchy, or other changes of that sort.
The <a href="https://github.com/gburca/rofs-filtered">read-only filtered
filesystem</a>, which simply filters the view of which files
are available, is one example; the file data could come directly from the
underlying 
filesystem, but currently needs to traverse the FUSE user-space server
process.  Finding a way to bypass the server, so that the file I/O operations go
directly from the application to the underlying filesystem would be beneficial.
  In
a filesystem session at the <a 
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Miklos Szeredi wanted to <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/CAJfpegu6xqH3U1icRcY1SeyVh0h-CirXJ-oaCXUsLCZGQgExUQ@mail.gmail.com/">explore
different options</a> for adding such a mechanism, which was referred to as
a "FUSE passthrough"—though "bypass" might be a better alternative.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/932072/">

alt="[Miklos Szeredi]" title="Miklos Szeredi" width=218 height=300>
</a>

<p>
The mechanism needs to establish a file mapping, so that the file
descriptor used by the application connects to the file on the underlying
filesystem, in order to bypass the FUSE server.
There is a question of what the
granularity of the file mapping should be, Szeredi
said.  It could simply be the whole file, or perhaps blocks or byte
ranges.  There is also a question about what is used to reference the
underlying file; an open file descriptor passed in a FUSE message would
work, but there is a security concern regarding that.  One way around that
restriction 
would be to create an <tt>ioctl()</tt> command to establish the mapping.
</p>

<p>
Filesystem-track organizer Amir Goldstein wondered why the <tt>ioctl()</tt>
was needed.  An attendee said that there were problems because
programs can be tricked into doing a <tt>write()</tt> to the FUSE daemon
using some, perhaps privileged,  file descriptor, but that it is much
harder to trick a 
program into doing a particular <tt>ioctl()</tt> command.  Christian
Brauner said that the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html">seccomp
notifier API</a> uses <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands for the same reason.  
</p>

<p>
There
was some discussion around why the problem being solved here was not more
widespread, without reaching much of a clear conclusion; adopting the
<tt>ioctl()</tt> mechanism seems prudent, at least for now.  This <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAG48ez17uXtjCTa7xpa=JWz3iBbNDQTKO2hvn6PAZtfW3kXgcA@mail.gmail.com/">email
from Jann Horn</a>, which Szeredi referenced when he suggested the topic, may
shed further light on the problem. 
This was followed by some ... rather hard to follow ... discussion of a
grab bag of 
different things that needed to be worked out, including the lifetime of
the mapping and whether different user namespaces would create
complications.  "Namespaces are horrible", David Howells said. 
</p> 

<p>
There are
several potential solutions for ways to bypass the FUSE server
for reads and writes so that those can go directly to the underlying
filesystem.  The most recent of those solutions is <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221122021536.1629178-1-drosen@google.com/">fuse-bpf</a>,
which has a wider scope but could perhaps provide the needed functionality.  Its
developer, Daniel Rosenberg, was on hand to describe how that filesystem
might fit into the picture.  Another fuse-bpf session was held on the last
day of LSFMM+BPF, as a combined filesystem and BPF session, coverage of
which will be coming in due course.
</p>

<p>
One goal of the fuse-bpf effort is to be as easy to use as FUSE is,
Rosenberg said.  There
is a set of calls that is "mirroring what the FUSE user-space calls would
be doing".  There are two hooks available for adding BPF filtering both
before and after the filesystem operation is performed.  The pre-filter
allows changing some of the input parameters to the operation, while the
post-filter can change the output data and error code.
</p>

<p>
Howells asked if fuse-bpf could be tricked to run arbitrary BPF programs,
perhaps even from remote sources.  Rosenberg said that the BPF programs have to
be registered with FUSE ahead of time. "This is no more dangerous than any
other BPF", an attendee said, to general laughter.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of how fuse-bpf could be used for passthrough,
but the read and write paths for that are not yet fully implemented,
Rosenberg said.  Beyond the BPF filters, there are also regular FUSE
filters that can be applied; those might be used to prototype a BPF filter,
to filter on more arguments than the BPF filters currently support, or to
perform some 
operation that the BPF verifier will reject.  
With a grin, he asked if there were "any questions about this thing that I
have not 
fully explained until Wednesday", referring to his upcoming talk.  It was
agreed that the ordering of the sessions was a tad unfortunate, but that a
more cohesive overview of fuse-bpf would be forthcoming.

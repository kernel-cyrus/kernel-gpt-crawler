<a href="/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> allow an ordinary user to
set up an environment in which they appear to be running as root and have
access to all operations normally reserved to privileged users — with
exceptions where such access cannot be made safe for the system as a
whole.  One of those exceptions is mounting of filesystems with
backing store (in other words, most real filesystems as opposed to
in-memory filesystems like tmpfs).  Work on enabling
filesystem mounts in user namespaces has been underway for <a
href="/Articles/652468/">over a 
year</a>.  While these mounts are still disallowed in the 4.8 kernel, many
of the infrastructural changes needed to eventually allow them have
been merged.
<p>
There are numerous potential problems with allowing filesystem mounts in
user namespaces.  Most of these result from the fact that user and group ID
values are mapped to different values inside user namespaces; this feature
allows root access to be turned into something unprivileged outside of the
namespace, but it also creates the potential for grave confusion if objects
in the filesystem are accessed from multiple namespaces.  Additionally, a
great deal of privilege information is encoded in filesystems; this
includes setuid executables, file capabilities, and security labels.
Making filesystem mounts in user namespaces safe requires ensuring that
there are no corner cases where privilege can leak across a namespace
boundary.
<p>
<h4>Special and setuid files</h4>
<p>
As was the case a year ago, the patch set starts by adding a new
<tt>s_user_ns</tt> field to the <tt>superblock</tt> structure used to
represent a mounted filesystem.  This field allows privilege-checking code
to detect filesystems mounted inside a namespace other than the initial
namespace and adjust its privilege checking accordingly.
<p>
One obvious problem area with unprivileged filesystem mounting is device
files.  A device special file gives direct access to a device on the
system, subject to the protections applied to the file.  A filesystem
mounted in a user namespace may be fully under the control of an
unprivileged user, who could happily populate it with device files that
just happen to allow full access; that, in turn, would be a direct path to
a total compromise of the system.  Developers working on user namespaces
wisely figured out some time ago that this particular feature might be seen
as undesirable by the wider community and have put a number of defensive
mechanisms in place.
<p>
The kernel has long had the ability to block the use of device special
files on a given filesystem; it is a matter of setting the <tt>nodev</tt>
flag at mount time.  That flag is automatically set now in the few
situations (such as tmpfs) where 
filesystem mounts are allowed inside user namespaces, but it has long been
seen as a dangerous area, since there is always 
potential that the filesystem could be remounted in a way that removes that
flag.  In 4.8, the <tt>nodev</tt> flag has been moved internally from the
<tt>vfsmount</tt> structure (representing a specific mount point) to the
<tt>superblock</tt> structure, of which there is a single instance for all
points where a given filesystem is mounted.  That makes it impossible to
strip the <tt>nodev</tt> flag away once it has been set and, hopefully,
heads off attacks based on device special files.
<p>
Once a user mounts a filesystem within a user namespace, said user can
create setuid files and files with capability masks.  As long as those
files are contained within that namespace, all is well; they will not give
the user any privileges they do not already have.  But perils await if those
files can somehow be accessed from outside of that namespace and,
unfortunately, there are paths (files under <tt>/proc</tt>, for example)
where that might happen.  To avoid
excessive consumption of CVE numbers in this area, the 4.8 kernel will
refuse to respect setuid flags, setgid flags, or file capabilities on a
file if that file is accessed from anything other than the namespace in
which it was initially mounted.
<p>
The next problem area is security labels used by security modules like
SELinux or Smack.  Security labels are not mapped at namespace boundaries
like user and group IDs are, so there is potential for trouble if a process
within a user namespace is able to gain security labels that it would not
otherwise have.  Running executables can be a path by which these labels
are acquired, so, once again, the system has to be careful about what it
allows within a user namespace, where the files may be entirely under an
attacker's control.  It must also be impossible for labels created within a
namespace to be used to elevate privilege outside that namespace.
<p>
Early work in this area simply disabled security labels entirely, but that
had unfortunate effects of its own, often rendering filesystems entirely
unusable.  There seems to be agreement that the ideal solution would be to
look at the label applied to the filesystem's backing store and use it for
all files within the filesystem in a user namespace.  That would give
processes in the namespace the same access that they would have outside of
it.  Unfortunately, it seems to be difficult to obtain that information at
the points in the kernel where  labels need to be checked, so that approach
cannot be used. 
<p>
The second-best approach is to use the label of the process that mounted
the filesystem.  Once again, that will keep the process from exceeding the
privilege it has anyway.  If Smack is running, it will deny access to files
whose label does not match the mounting process's label.  For SELinux, at this
point, the label applied to the mount point applies through the entire
filesystem and the labels on individual files are simply ignored.  There
are suggestions that the SELinux approach may gain sophistication over
time.
<p>
<h4>User and group IDs</h4>
<p>
There is yet another set of potential pitfalls around user and group IDs in
general.  When a user namespace is created, a set of ID mappings is set up
along with it.  Those mappings translate in-namespace user and group IDs to
their equivalents outside of the namespace.  A user with ID 1000 may start a
user namespace where 1000 in the wider world is mapped to&nbsp;0 (root)
inside the namespace; others IDs can be mapped as well.  One result of this
mapping is a restriction in the range of valid user and group IDs.  In the
initial namespace, any ID is considered valid by the kernel; inside a user
namespace, instead, only IDs that have been explicitly mapped are valid.
That is a significant semantic change in how these IDs are handled.
<p>
When a process within a user namespace accesses a filesystem mounted
outside that namespace, its user and group IDs will be mapped accordingly
before any access decisions are made.
If the filesystem has been mounted within the namespace, though, that
mapping should not happen.  But how should the kernel respond if that
filesystem contains user and group IDs that are not considered valid within
the namespace?
The answer, in general, is that those values are mapped to the special
<tt>INVALID_UID</tt> and <tt>INVALID_GID</tt> values, both of which are
defined to be&nbsp;<tt>-1</tt>.  That change prevents unknown IDs within the
namespace from creating confusion outside the namespace, but it has a few
hazards of its own.
<p>
For example, the "protected symlinks" mechanism, if enabled, prevents a
process from following a symbolic link if the user ID of the link owner
differs from that of the directory in which the link is found.  This
restriction (along with a couple of others) is meant to thwart temporary
file vulnerabilities and related unpleasantness when a privileged process
is fooled into opening a file it was not meant to open.  But consider a
situation where the link and containing-directory owners do not match, but
where both are owned by IDs that are not valid in the namespace; they will
both be mapped to <tt>INVALID_UID</tt> and will, within the namespace,
appear to match.  The function <tt>may_follow_link()</tt>, where these
checks are made, has been duly changed to ensure that the IDs are valid.
<p>
Creating files with invalid IDs can only lead to trouble later on, so that
must be prohibited.  A more interesting problem arises when attempting to
modify a file that already has an invalid ID.  Any changes to a file will
cause its inode structure to be written back to persistent storage, but the
inode will contain the <tt>INVALID_UID</tt> and <tt>INVALID_GID</tt>
values, which should not be written back.  The solution adopted here is to
simply disallow modification of files with invalid IDs altogether, rather
than try to fix all the ways that a corrupt inode might be written.  So
such files will be read-only on filesystems mounted within a user
namespace, even if their permissions would allow modification.  There is
one exception planned, though it has not been implemented yet: changing the
IDs to valid values will be allowed; doing so will potentially make the file
writable.
<p>
<h4>Not done yet</h4>
<p>
The list of potential problems does not end there.  Disk quotas must be
handled properly and not be confused by invalid IDs.  The integrity
management subsystem must be taught to not be fooled by filesystems mounted
in user namespaces.  Access-control lists must be checked to ensure that
they do not contain invalid IDs.  And so on, including, presumably, some
special cases that nobody has thought about.  For this reason, Eric
Biederman, who took over the patch set from Seth Forshee and made it
suitable for merging, said in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a867d7349e94b6409b08629886a819f802377e91">the
pull request</a>: "<q>I am not considering even obvious relaxations of
permission checks until it is clear there are no more corner cases that
need to be locked down and handled generically.</q>"
Finding all of those cases may take a while yet, and it may take even
longer for developers to convince themselves that no traps remain.
<p>
But
there is another aspect to the problem that was extensively discussed in
2015, but which has not come up at all this time around.  Most Linux
filesystems are simply not designed to be robust in the face of
deliberately hostile on-disk filesystem images.  As long as mounting a
filesystem has been a privileged operation, that has not normally been a
problem; getting an administrator to mount a random ext4 or XFS filesystem
image can take quite a bit of social engineering.  Once filesystem mounts
are possible within user namespaces, that situation changes: any attacker
with a local account can mount malicious filesystems.  They will also be
able to change the underlying filesystem at any time, further widening the
range of potential mischief.  Said mischief undoubtedly includes a number
of opportunities to fully compromise the kernel.
<p>
Hardening filesystems against attacks from below is not a simple matter;
such hardening has never been a design goal for the filesystems in common
use.  Doing so in a way that preserves performance will be even more
difficult.  So it is not really clear when it might truly be safe to allow
unprivileged users to mount arbitrary filesystems.  Even after the kernel
reaches a point where this capability might be enabled, one might well
expect distributors and administrators to keep it disabled for a long
time.  There is clear value in this feature, but it may be some time before
it's made widely available.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
We're still working on getting our filesystem fuzzing-with-AFL code out (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/685182/">http://lwn.net/Articles/685182/</a>) but currently it does not take more than a few hours to find kernel-crashing bugs in any of the most widely used filesystems (ext4, xfs, btrfs, etc.). Several other filesystems crash in a matter of seconds under our AFL-based fuzzer.<br>
<p>
I've looked more closely at ext4 myself and trying to fix the bugs that came up (<a href="http://lists.openwall.net/linux-ext4/2016/07/14/5">http://lists.openwall.net/linux-ext4/2016/07/14/5</a>, <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg53166.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg53166.html</a>) and Bo Liu has been fixing quite a few bugs in btrfs. Other filesystems are on the roadmap but the sheer volume of issues means we don't have the manpower/bandwidth to fix everything at once.<br>
<p>
Even so, these are only the bugs found by fuzzing. I can't find the link right now but I think there was a paper where somebody deliberately inserted bugs in the code and tried to discover them with coverage-guided fuzzing and it still only found some 10% of the bugs.<br>
<p>
In light of all this, I would be extremely wary of enabling unprivileged mounts. Automatic mounting of external media (still enabled by default on most desktop distros) is already quite bad enough.<br>

The primary target for now remains fuse.<br>
<p>
We may be able to support other filesystems eventually but fuse should be supportable now.<br>
Do you have any fuzz testing with respect to fuse?<br>
<p>
The work of handling the odd cases was performed with respect to the vfs and not fuse as the necessary changes are cleaner and more obvious that way. <br>
<p>
Fuse presents a very interesting case as it allows isolating the filesystem code in userspace while still allowing that code to be used by all programs through the vfs.<br>
<p>
Fuse can support all of the popular filesystems today, and as such provides a safer alternative to mounting filesystems on usb sticks.   The user namespace mount aspect of this just this all more usable.<br>

This situation appears similar to that of network filesystems. If a filesystem is exported to the local network, anyone who is root on a box on the network can mount it and create many of the same problems described here. Perhaps some of the concepts from nfs like exports and usermappings can be used in the user namespace situation. <br>

I don't think INVALID_UID is actually -1.  UIDs are unsigned 32-bit ints.  So it's not the well-known `nobody` user ((u16) -1), but it's the equivalent for 32-bit UIDs.<br>

Nitpick: nobody is uid (u16)-2, i.e. 65534.<br>

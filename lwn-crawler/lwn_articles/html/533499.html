<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>January 23, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> <a href="/Articles/374424/">Huge pages</a> are an optimization
technique designed to increase virtual memory performance. The idea is that
instead of a traditional small virtual memory page size (4 kB on most
architectures), an application can employ (much) larger pages (e.g., 2 MB
or 1 GB on x86-64). For applications that can make full use of larger pages,
huge pages provide a number of performance benefits. First, a single page
fault can fault in a large block of memory. Second, larger page sizes
equate to shallower page tables, since fewer page-table levels are required
to span the same range of virtual addresses; consequently, less time is
required to traverse page table entries when translating virtual addresses
to physical addresses. Finally, and most significantly, since entries for
huge pages in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) span much greater
address ranges, there is an increased chance that a virtual address already
has a match in one of the limited set of entries currently cached in the
TLB, thus obviating the need to traverse page tables.

<p> Applications can explicitly request the use of huge pages when making
allocations, using either <tt>shmget()</tt> with the <tt>SHM_HUGETLB</tt>
flag (since Linux 2.6.0) or <tt>mmap()</tt> with the <tt>MAP_HUGETLB</tt>
flag (since Linux 2.6.32). It's worth noting that explicit application
requests are not needed to employ huge pages: the <a
href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge pages</a> feature merged in Linux
2.6.38 allows applications to gain much of the performance benefit of
huge pages without making any changes to application code. There is,
however, a limitation to these APIs: they provide no way to specify the
size of the huge pages to be used for an allocation.  Instead, the kernel
employs the "default" huge page size.

<p> Some architectures only permit one huge page size; on those
architectures, the default is in fact the only choice.  However, some
modern architectures permit multiple huge page sizes, and where the system
administrator has configured the system to provide huge page pools of
different sizes, applications may want to choose the page size used for
their allocation. For example, this may be useful in a NUMA environment,
where a smaller huge page size may be suitable for mappings that are shared
across CPUs, while a larger page size is used for mappings local to a single
CPU.

<p> A <a href="/Articles/533650/">patch</a> by Andi Kleen that was accepted
during the 3.8 merge window extends the <tt>shmget()</tt> and
<tt>mmap()</tt> system calls to allow the caller to select the size used
for huge page allocations. These system calls have the following
prototypes:

<pre>
    void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
               int fd, off_t offset);
    int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
</pre>

<p> Neither of those calls provides an argument that can be directly used
to specify the desired page size. Therefore, Andi's patch shoehorns the
value into some bits that are currently unused in one of the arguments of
each call&mdash;in the <tt>flags</tt> argument for <tt>mmap()</tt> and in the
<tt>shmflg</tt> argument for <tt>shmget()</tt>.

<p> In both system calls, the huge page size is encoded in the six bits
from 26 through to 31 (i.e., the bit mask <tt>0xfc000000</tt>).  The value
in those six bits is the base-two log of the desired page size. As a special case, if the value encoded in the bits is
zero, then the kernel selects the default huge page size. This provides
binary backward compatibility for the interfaces. If the
specified page size is not supported by the architecture, then
<tt>shmget()</tt> and <tt>mmap()</tt> fail with the error
<tt>ENOMEM</tt>.


<p> An
application can manually perform the required base-two log calculation and
bit shift to generate the required bit-mask value, but this is
clumsy. Instead, an architecture can define suitable constants for the huge
page sizes that it supports.  Andi's patch defines two such constants corresponding to the
available page sizes on x86-64:

<pre>
    #define SHM_HUGE_SHIFT  26
    #define SHM_HUGE_MASK   0x3f
    /* Flags are encoded in bits (SHM_HUGE_MASK << SHM_HUGE_SHIFT) */

    #define SHM_HUGE_2MB    (21 &lt;&lt; SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)   /* 2 MB huge pages */
    #define SHM_HUGE_1GB    (30 &lt;&lt; SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)   /* 1 GB huge pages */
</pre>

<p> Corresponding <tt>MAP_*</tt> constants are defined for use in
the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call.


<p>
Thus, to employ a 2 MB huge page size when calling <tt>shmget()</tt>, one
would write:

<pre>
    shmget(key, size, flags | SHM_HUGETLB | SHM_HUGE_2MB);
</pre>

<p>
That is, of course, the same as this manually calculated version:
 
<pre>
    shmget(key, size, flags | SHM_HUGETLB | (21 << HUGE_PAGE_SHIFT));
</pre>



<p> In passing, it's worth noting that an application can determine the
default page size by looking at the <tt>Hugepagesize</tt> entry in
<tt>/proc/meminfo</tt> and can, if the kernel was configured with
<tt>CONFIG_HUGETLBFS</tt>, discover the available page sizes on the system
by scanning the directory entries under <tt>/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages</tt>.



<p> One concern <a href="/Articles/533681/">raised</a> by your editor when
reviewing an earlier version of Andi's patch was whether the bit space in
the <tt>mmap()</tt> <tt>flags</tt> argument is becoming exhausted. Exactly
how many bits are still unused in that argument turns out to be a little
difficult to determine, because different architectures define the same
flags with different values. For example, the <tt>MAP_HUGETLB</tt> flag has
the values 0x4000, 0x40000, 0x80000, or 0x100000, depending on the
architecture. It turns out that before Andi's patch was applied, there were
only around 11 bits in <tt>flags</tt> that were unused across all
architectures; now that the patch has been applied, just six are left.

<p> The day when the <tt>mmap()</tt> <tt>flags</tt> bit space is exhausted
seems to be slowly but steadily approaching. When that happens, either a
new <tt>mmap()</tt>-style API with a 64-bit <tt>flags</tt> argument will be
required, or, as Andi <a href="/Articles/533682/">suggested</a>, unused
bits in the <tt>prot</tt> argument could be used; the latter option would
be easier to implement, but would also further muddy the interface of an
already complex system call. In any case, concerns about the API design
didn't stop Andrew Morton from accepting the patch, although he was
prompted to <a href="/Articles/533683/">remark</a> "<q>I can't say the
userspace interface is a thing of beauty, but I guess we'll live.</q>"

<p> The new API features will roll out in few weeks' time with the 3.8
release. At that point, application writers will be able to select
different huge page sizes for different memory allocations. However, it
will take a little longer before the <tt>MAP_*</tt> and <tt>SHM_*</tt> page
size constants percolate through to the GNU C library. In the meantime,
programmers who are in a hurry will have to define their own versions of
these constants.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Why not change the <tt>flags</tt> type from <tt>int</tt> to a new aliased data type, e.g. <tt>flagset_t</tt><sup>1</sup> (itself typedef'ed to <tt>int</tt> currently, and then later, when needed, re-typedefed to <tt>int64_t</tt>)?</p>

<p>Yes, I realize this is easier said than done, and it would require changes to both userspace and the kernel, but if the change were made now then it would get glibc and friends time to work out issues associated with the API change.  If this is too radical or ugly change to make, then I'll certainly plead guilty to being naÃ¯ve.</p>

<blockquote><font class="QuotedText">In both system calls, the huge page size is encoded in the six bits from 26 through to 31</font></blockquote>

<p>I, for one, think Andi's method of storing numeric values in the high-order bits of <tt>flags</tt> is quite elegant<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> My motivation for suggesting &quot;<tt>flagset_t</tt>&quot; was based on seeing all the <tt>*_t</tt> types contained within a <tt>struct stat</tt> (see <tt>stat(2)</tt> ).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> I've used a similar technique in storing both options flags and numeric values in a single 32-bit integer when using <tt>getopt(3)</tt>.</p>

That works on 64 bit architectures but will cause issues on 32 bit as you would need a new system call as the ABI is changed by extending flags...<br>

Hopefully there are no applications that (incorrectly) use other flags with MAP_HUGETLB that now conflict with the new use of the bits. Or was that impossible before?<br>

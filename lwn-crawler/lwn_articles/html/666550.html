<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 2, 2015</br>
           </div>
At the <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2015">2015 Kernel Summit</a>, the
assembled developers <a href="/Articles/662907/">discussed</a> the idea of
incorporating more security-hardening patches into the kernel.  As part of
that effort, it was agreed that taking another look at the out-of-tree <a
href="https://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity</a> patches made sense.  The
first fruit from this work would appear to be the <a
href="/Articles/666016/">post-init read-only memory</a> patch set from Kees
Cook.  This work has been received well, but it also highlights some of the
difficulties involved with hardening a general-purpose kernel.
<p>
The key to a successful exploit is often convincing the kernel to write to
an unintended location.  See, for example, <a
href="http://itszn.com/blog/?p=21">this recent exploit</a>, which uses a
driver bug to overwrite a portion of the <a href="/Articles/615809/">vDSO
area</a>; that, in turn, enables an attacker to run arbitrary code in
kernel mode.  One way to defend against such attacks is to minimize, to the
greatest extent possible, the memory that the kernel is allowed to write
to.  A number of techniques, from simply marking data read-only to <a
href="/Articles/517475/">supervisor-mode access prevention</a>, can be
deployed toward that end.  There is one class of data, identified by the
grsecurity developers, that current techniques overlook, however.
<p>
When the kernel boots, it sets up a vast array of data structures
describing the hardware it runs on and much more.  In many cases, those
data structures will never be changed again but, since they are resident
in writable memory, they can still be changed by an errant write
operation.  The post-init read-only memory patch set, as posted by Kees,
allows these data structures to be marked with a special
<tt>__read_only</tt> annotation.  That will cause them to be placed into a
separate ELF section ("<tt>.data..read_only</tt>").  Once the kernel has
finished the initialization process, all data found in that section will be
marked read-only, never to be changed again.  At that point, exploits like
the vDSO overwrite linked above will no longer work.
<p>
This change seems like an obvious win: unchanging data is marked read-only,
blocking known exploits and, perhaps, minimizing the impact of simple bugs
as well.  As an added bonus, read-only data will be kept together, leading
to better cache behavior.
It would appear to be an obvious candidate for merging in the
near future.  That will probably come to pass, but, first, an important
question has to be answered: what should happen when the hardware catches
an attempt by the  kernel to write
(post initialization) memory that had been marked <tt>__read_only</tt>?
<p>
<h4>When things go wrong</h4>
<p>
This question matters because there is a potential hazard whenever a data
structure is marked <tt>__read_only</tt>: the developer involved may have
overlooked the one case where, after a rare sequence of events on days with
a waxing gibbous moon, that data structure must be changed.  Or there may
be a case where data structures are modified unnecessarily, perhaps storing
data that is already there anyway.  Such cases work in current kernels, but
would break if the data being written were made read-only.  Mathias Krause <a
href="/Articles/666553/">described one such experience</a>, wherein the
system would fail during the resume sequence.  As he noted:
"<q>Debugging that kind of problem is sort of a PITA, you could
imagine.</q>"
<p>
The ideal solution would be to have the compiler catch attempts to modify
<tt>__read_only</tt> data outside of the initialization sequence, but that
is not currently possible.  Simply marking the relevant data structures
<tt>const</tt> will not work; those data structures <i>are</i> written to
during boot and, as PaX Team <a href="/Articles/666555/">pointed out</a>,
making them <tt>const</tt> opens the door to all kinds of surprising,
optimization-related behavior from the compiler.  Where compilers are
involved, surprising behavior is rarely a good thing.  As an alternative,
Mathias suggested the use of a special-purpose GCC module to detect
inappropriate writes.  There seems to be agreement that this is a good
idea, but no such module exists and it will take time to create one.
Holding this patch set until a checker module can be created seems
undesirable.
<p>
But without such a checker, there will almost certainly be situations where
the kernel tries to write to something marked <tt>__read_only</tt>, either
because it was so marked in error or as the result of some other bug.
There have been a number of ideas put forward on how such problems could be
handled.
<p>
The most obvious thing to do is to simply oops the kernel, with the usual
results for the process that was running and, perhaps, the machine as a
whole.  Andy Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/666557/">supported</a> this
approach, saying: "<q>We failed, we might be under attack, let's
oops.</q>"  The problem with this approach, of course, is that it takes
the machine out of commission, possibly with an error that is less than fun
to try to track down.  Ingo Molnar also <a
href="/Articles/666558/">worried</a> that the oops information would, in
most desktop cases, never be seen by the user and, as a result, would never
be reported to developers.  That highlights an old problem with presenting
such information on desktop systems, but that problem is unlikely to be
fixed right now.
<p>
The alternative to oopsing the system would be to log the error and somehow
try to continue.  Ingo <a href="/Articles/666560/">suggested</a> simply
skipping over the offending instruction and trying to continue, but that
idea did not go far; as PaX Team <a href="/Articles/666561/">pointed
out</a>, simply dropping an intended write operation could create no end of
strange problems further down the line and may actually help exploit
attempts.  Linus <a href="/Articles/666562/">suggested</a>, instead, that
the kernel could mark the relevant page writable and retry the
instruction.  That would, of course, remove the read-only protection from
that page, but it would allow the system to continue to operate while
generating diagnostic information for developers.  One would probably not
want things to work this way on a production system, but it could be an
invaluable option for developers.
<p>
The final piece of the puzzle might be to have a kernel command-line
operation to disable the read-only marking entirely.  That would provide an
option to users who run into a bug and need to be able to get their work
done until a proper fix is available.
<p>
Kees has <a href="/Articles/666564/">indicated</a> that his current
approach is to take the kill-the-machine approach by default.  He has
already implemented the command-line option, and said that Linus's
"mark the page writable" suggestion would not be difficult to add.  So the
next version of the patch should have addressed most of the concerns
expressed so far.  Getting it merged may prove to be the easy part, though;
the task of identifying and marking truly read-only data could be a long and
error-prone affair, even when starting with the work that the grsecurity
developers have already done.  The good news is that this work should make
the kernel more secure, provide a (perhaps imperceptible) performance
improvement, and turn up a few bugs along the way.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

A few notes:<br>
<p>
The exploit linked to was just an example of one exploit for an educational kernel vulnerability created as part of a CTF.  The linked blog links to another participant's exploit for the same vulnerability that would work regardless of the __read_only changes currently being discussed.<br>
<p>
Of note however is that that exploit would be made more difficult (even in the absence of any other grsecurity/PaX features) by RANDSTRUCT.  Both exploits also wouldn't work as-is solely due to USERCOPY (another grsecurity feature being discussed recently).<br>
<p>
Finally, the initial source of the vulnerability, an overflow in a call to krealloc, is firmly in the class of vulnerabilities PaX's size_overflow GCC plugin was designed to prevent.  So regardless of desired exploit method, catching the overflow and terminating the attacking process prevents the attacker from gaining the arbitrary read/write primitive via copy_*_user and thus prevents any exploitation of the vulnerability.<br>

Two more comments actually that I forgot to mention:<br>
<p>
The proposed patches currently don't handle the use of __read_only in modules, they'll simply still be writable.<br>
<p>
Grsecurity makes use of __read_only in many places that won't be possible with the reduced infrastructure proposed upstream.  Specifically, we are able to use __read_only on data that is writable infrequently even after init (for instance, to protect important sysctl values, or LSM's security_ops struct).  It's able to accomplish this on ARM, x86, and x64 through a feature of our KERNEXEC architecture that temporarily allows write access to read-only data for the current CPU in a race-free manner.<br>

To oops or not to oops is a policy question, right? Aren't LSMs the vector for making and enforcing security-related policy decisions? So trigger a LSM hook and let that policy make the proper decision for that organization/system/cluster/server/toaster. That allows the most flexibility, including the possibility of simultaneously using all 3 proposed actions (oops, relocate and write, and silently drop) customized for each module. <br>

FWIW, I've been taking a similar approach while working on enhancing my hibernation patch to allow the creation of incremental images. Getting a COW mechanism working has been easy. The difficult part has been figuring out _what_ in kernelspace to make read only. Too much and you can't boot, too little and there's no point in doing it.<br>
<p>
All of this is a long way of saying perhaps there's value in making something more generic that could be used for security and incremental hibernation images and whatever else might be able to use it in the future?<br>

In the D programming language, there is a type qualifier "immutable" which, once the data has been initialised, cannot be changed. The compiler can then statically check that this is not violated. If I'm not misunderstanding this, this is essentially what __read_only is, minus the static checking part.<br>
<p>
Such a qualifier might make for either a nice GCC compiler extension or an addition to the next C language specification revision, since (if I'm not mistaken) such a functionality would solve this particular case. The "initialise once, keep around read-only for a long time" paradigm is probably present in a lot of software, so while any language revisions or GCC extensions might be too far away for this Linux patch set, a lot of C code could probably benefit from it.<br>

i don't know D but if initialization is meant the C way then __read_only is not 'immutable' because a __read_only variable can be modified any number of times - provided it's all done during kernel init. also the __read_only attribute is primarily a hint to enforce a specific property at *runtime*, compile time checking is needed only to avoid false positives. as for its general usefulness, the kernel already has a notion of separating its init code from the rest, userland would need more extensive changes and also the infrastructure to enforce the runtime property (perhaps RELRO could be repurposed or extended for this, right now it's activated too early for being usable for __read_only).<br>

There's another question concerning compiler behaviour. In C, data marked volatile must be read once per evaluation, and written at most once per modification and at no other times, and that order of access (per data object, i.e. irrespective of other data) is maintained according to program source. This forbids the compiler from e.g. using a MMIO register to spill registers because it looks like memory that's either hot[0] right now, or could be warmed up for an eventual overwrite -- which a further slice of the stack might not be.<br>
<p>
So the question is: what measures are there for __read_only sections that prevent the compiler from writing the memory willy-nilly? Presumably it's not marked volatile for its performance cost.<br>

does the standard allow accessing objects with static storage duration willy-nilly?<br>

No idea, to be honest. I'm more concerned with whether the standard forbids such access (and I don't know that it does), given that this is the reading that compiler implementors are going to go by. There's a lot of stuff that's implicitly permitted to go on between points of external visibility.<br>

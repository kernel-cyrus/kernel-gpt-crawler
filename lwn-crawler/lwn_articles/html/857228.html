The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
mechanism allows a process to load a BPF program to restrict its future use
of system calls; it is a simple but flexible sandboxing mechanism that is
widely used.  Those filter programs, though, run on the "classic" BPF virtual
machine, rather than the <a href="/Articles/740157/">extended BPF
(eBPF)</a> machine used elsewhere in the 
kernel.  Moving <tt>seccomp()</tt> to eBPF has been an often-requested
change, but security concerns have prevented that from happening.  The
latest attempt to enable eBPF is <a
href="/ml/bpf/cover.1620499942.git.yifeifz2@illinois.edu/">this patch
set</a> from YiFei Zhu; whether it will succeed where others have failed
remains to be seen.
<p>
The purpose of a BPF program under <tt>seccomp()</tt> is to make a decision
about whether a given system call should be allowed; to that end, these
programs have limited access to the system-call arguments.  There is also
<a href="/Articles/756233/">a notification
mechanism</a> by which decisions can be punted to a user-space daemon if
needed.  By using a filter program, tools like browsers or
container-management systems can place limits on what they or their subprocesses
can do.
<p>
There are a number of reasons for wanting to use eBPF to write these
programs — essentially, all of the motivations that led to the creation of
eBPF in the first place.  Switching to eBPF would make a number of new
features available to <tt>seccomp()</tt> filter programs, including maps,
helper functions, per-task storage, a more expressive instruction set, and
more.  Programs for eBPF can be written in&nbsp;C, which is not possible
for classic-BPF programs — a problem that has led to the creation of
special languages like <a
href="https://github.com/giuseppe/easyseccomp">easyseccomp</a>.  There is a
whole ecosystem of tools for eBPF 
that developers using <tt>seccomp()</tt> would like to use.
<p>
Given all of that, one might think that using eBPF with <tt>seccomp()</tt> would
be uncontroversial; the roadblock in this case is security worries.
The current mechanism is relatively simple and easy to verify; eBPF brings
a whole new level of complexity to worry about.  Applying a filter program
with <tt>seccomp()</tt> is an unprivileged operation, and it would need to
stay that way, but the BPF developers have <a
href="/Articles/796328/">given up</a> on the idea of making eBPF safe for
unprivileged use.  Nobody is interested in turning <tt>seccomp()</tt> into
a security problem in its own right.
<p>
Zhu hopes to avoid this pitfall by adding a number of restrictions to eBPF
filter programs, to the point that, for the most part, users cannot do
anything with eBPF that is not already doable with classic BPF and user-space
notifiers.  The biggest exception, perhaps, is that access to maps and
the set of standard helpers is allowed; the reasoning here is that
unprivileged users can gain access to those facilities via socket-filter
programs now, so nothing new is being exposed here.  The patch set does add
a Linux security module hook controlling access to these features from
<tt>seccomp()</tt> filter programs, though, allowing them to be disabled if
desired.  There is also a patch to the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.html">Yama</a>
security module allowing easy control over this functionality.
<p>
The additional set of eBPF helpers that is provided for tracing programs
can be made available to filter
programs as well, but only if the user who loads the filter program has the
necessary privileges (<tt>CAP_BPF</tt> and <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt>) to load
tracing programs.  These helpers, among other things, provide access to
memory in ways that could be useful in the <tt>seccomp()</tt> context —
looking more deeply at system-call arguments, for example.  There is also a
mechanism for storing state within a task for use across filters, but it
requires privilege to be truly useful.
<p>
It is worth noting that the privilege checks for these features are done at
the time that a 
BPF program of the new type (<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SECCOMP</tt>) is loaded;
attachment of a filter program to a process is always unprivileged.  It is
thus possible for a privileged daemon to load a set of approved programs
and pass them to other users, who would then be able to use a more complete
set of eBPF features.
<p>
Getting a patch series like this merged will require convincing two
different sets of people — the BPF maintainers and security-oriented
developers.  The picture on the BPF side is unclear.  Alexei
Starovoitov, the creator of eBPF, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190509044720.fxlcldi74atev5id@ast-mbp/">asserted</a> in
May 2019 that "<q>seccomp needs to start using ebpf</q>".  Three
months later, instead, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190814005737.4qg6wh4a53vmso2v@ast-mbp/">his position</a>
was: "<q>I'm absolutely against using eBPF in seccomp</q>".  The
change was part of his general shift against making eBPF available to
unprivileged users; he feared that it could never be made secure at a
reasonable cost and there were few users for it in any case.  In the
discussion of Zhu's patches, though, he has only asked about details of the
implementation and has not expressed opposition to the idea overall.  So
perhaps the BPF side is ready to accept eBPF being used with
<tt>seccomp()</tt>.
<p>
Convincing the security folks might be harder.  Back in 2018, Kees Cook was
<a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAGXu5jKv3QFVKLhok1JWiPamE0b4CqLTO-hx8sP0KWED921=6w@mail.gmail.com/">strongly
opposed</a> to using eBPF in <tt>seccomp()</tt>; he said that it moves far
too quickly and has experienced too many security issues to be usable in
that setting.  In the current discussion, Andy Lutomirski has <a
href="/ml/bpf/b3a1684b-86e4-74c4-184b-7700613aa838@kernel.org/">let it be
known</a> that the patch set would encounter a "<q>very high bar
to acceptance</q>".  He worried that it would be harder to verify that
the implementation is secure if the more complex eBPF system is used, and
the resistance to properly supporting 
unprivileged use of eBPF is an ongoing problem:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The last time making eBPF work sensibly in a less- or -unprivileged
	context, the maintainers mostly rejected the idea of
	developing/debugging a permission model for maps, cleaning up the
	bpf object id system, etc.  You are going to have a very hard time
	convincing the seccomp maintainers to let any of these mechanism
	interact with seccomp until the underlying permission model is in
	place.
</div>
<p>
That part of the discussion stopped there.  This disagreement could prove
fatal to the idea of integrating eBPF with <tt>seccomp()</tt>; the BPF
developers do not want to try to support unprivileged use, while the
<tt>seccomp()</tt> developers are requiring that support.  In the absence
of some sort of solution, the current eBPF-in-<tt>seccomp()</tt> work seems
likely to end up in the same place as its predecessors — and not in the
mainline.  That is unfortunate, as this is a functionality that
<tt>seccomp()</tt> users would like to have.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

They actually run on the eBPF virtual machine (see latest update from Kees Cook on the bpf ML); the cBPF programs are just transformed into eBPF programs internally.<br>

Hmmn, instead of doing an updater (old to new), I wonder if one could simply reject all the dangerous bits, and allow authors to use the newer notation so long as they avoided a particular feature-set?<br>
<p>
That assumes, of course, that you can tell dangerous from safe syntactically.<br>

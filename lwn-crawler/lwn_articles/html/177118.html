"<q>Holy cow.</q>"
<p>

That was Andrew Morton's <a href="/Articles/177119/">reaction</a> to a
34-part patch, posted by Peter Zijlstra, which creates an abstract API for
page replacement policies.  The page replacement code is at the core of the
virtual memory system; it is, essentially, a set of heuristics which must
decide which pages should be evicted from main memory and made available
for other uses.  Page replacement is a bit of a black art; it is easy to
see when a system is managing memory poorly, but path to improvements
is often far from clear.  Memory management in Linux was a sore point
for many years, but it seems to work well for most loads now.  Given that
all this tricky code has finally been beaten into reasonably good shape,
why would anybody want to mess with it now?
<p>

The answer is that there is quite a bit of research work going into
alternative page replacement mechanisms, and Linux might just be able to
benefit from some of that work.  After all, few people would say that Linux
virtual memory works so well that there is no room for improvement.
<p>

This massive patch set creates an API for page replacement
algorithms, allowing them to be changed at will.  Or, at least, changed at
reboot; there is currently no provision for loading replacement algorithms
as modules or swapping them out on the fly.  But, by selecting a page
replacement scheme at kernel configuration time, system administrators can
choose one which best suits their workload.  Virtual memory hackers and
others can play with different algorithms to see how they work out.  And
there is no need to pick one in particular as the page replacement
algorithm for the Linux kernel.
<p>

To work with this API, a page replacement algorithm must define a set of
specific functions.  Thus, for example, there is a pair of initialization
functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void page_replace_init(void);
    void page_replace_init_zone(struct zone *zone);
</pre>
<p>
These functions, called at boot time, prepare the page replacement code to
work with the system it finds itself running on.
<p>
When the core kernel knows something about the use of specific pages, it
can tell the replacement algorithm with these calls:
<p>
<pre>
    void page_replace_hint_active(struct page *page);
    void page_replace_hint_use_once(struct page *page);
</pre>
<p>
The first is called when the kernel notes that the page is in active use,
while the second indicates that the page is unlikely to be used again in
the near future.
<p>
There are various other functions for helping with the housekeeping, but
the core of the API is this function here:
<p>
<pre>
    void page_replace_candidates(struct zone *zone, int count,
                                 struct list_head *list);
</pre>
<p>
This function must select up to <tt>count</tt> pages from the given <tt>zone</tt>
as candidates for eviction.  This is where the page replacement code will
gaze into its crystal ball to figure out which pages will not be used again
anytime soon; those are the ones which will be singled out and passed back
to the core kernel.
<p>
Quite a few other functions exist.  They deal with issues like page
migration, tracking of non-resident pages, printing out information from
the page replacement code, and more.  See <a href="/Articles/177123/">the
documentation file</a> for a full list and brief explanation of those other
functions.
<p>
The patch set also contains four different page replacement mechanisms.
One is the modified least-recently-used (LRU) code found in current
kernels, reworked to use the new API.  Another is the CLOCK-PRO
algorithm, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/147879/">covered here</a> last
August.  There is an implementation of the CART technique, discussed in <a
href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/dmodha/clockfast.pdf">this paper
[PDF]</a>.  Then there is a simple random replacement scheme, seemingly
just for the fun of it.  Actually, the <a href="/Articles/177127/">random
replacement patch</a> is, due to its simplicity, a good place to start for
somebody interested in seeing what a modularized page replacement algorithm
looks like.
<p>

This patch looks somewhat similar to the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/109458/">pluggable CPU schedulers patch</a>,
which allows the scheduling algorithm to be changed.  That patch continues
to be maintained, but, since its initial posting in 2004, it has never been
seriously considered for inclusion into the mainline kernel.  There is a
strong preference toward figuring out what's wrong - if anything - with the
current code and fixing it, rather than creating a mechanism for playing
with entirely different implementations.  Thus, Andrew Morton followed his
initial response with:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Rather than replacing the whole lot four times I'd really prefer to
	see precise descriptions of these problems, see if we can improve
	the situation incrementally rather than wholesale slash-n-burn...
</div>
<p>
Linus has <a href="/Articles/177124/">a similar opinion</a>, and,
additionally, is not convinced that page replacement is really an issue
needing a great deal of attention.  "<q>It smells like university
research to me.</q>" 
<p>
The proponents of this patch respond that there are, indeed, situations
where the current code falls apart.  Given that, the next logical step
would seem to be gathering information on the cases where Linux memory
management fails.  Then the developers can start to think about what needs
to be done to address those failures.  Even if the page replacement
framework patches are never merged, it looks like they may help to drive
forward the next phase of work in Linux memory management algorithms.
That should be a good thing regardless.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

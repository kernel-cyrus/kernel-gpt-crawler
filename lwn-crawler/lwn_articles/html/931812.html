The memory-management subsystem has the unenviable task of trying to
predict which pages of memory will be needed in the near future.  Since
predictions tend to be difficult, the code relies heavily on the heuristic
that memory used in the recent past is likely to be used again in the near
future.  However, even knowing which memory has been recently used can be a
challenge.  At the 2023 <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Aneesh Kumar and Wei Xu,
both presenting remotely,
discussed some ways to use the increasingly capable hardware counters that
are provided by current and upcoming CPUs.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931916/"><img

title="Aneesh Kumar" class="lthumb"></a>

Kumar started by talking about how these counters, which can count page
accesses, might be used to improve the <a
href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational LRU</a>; he has recently posted
<a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230402104240.1734931-1-aneesh.kumar@linux.ibm.com/">a
patch series</a> implementing this functionality.  It uses page-access
counters to help with the sorting of pages into generations.  Counters
help, but do not entirely solve the problem, he said; most architectures
can produce access counts at this point, but those are absolute numbers.
Page sorting requires a sense of <i>relative</i> activity — which pages are
seeing more activity than others now?  The code works by looking at the
counts for some pages in the oldest and youngest generations, using them to
estimate what the minimum and maximum numbers would be.  Those values are
then used to classify other pages.  He said that it might be feasible to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means
clustering</a> to classify pages instead.
<p>
The advantage of using the counters is that the kernel can skip the work of
walking through a process's page tables to find the pages that have been
accessed recently.  It also eliminates the need to store generation
information in the page flags, which are a tightly limited resource.  The
results from benchmarking this code were somewhat inconclusive, though;
some workloads regressed slightly, while others improved a little.
Optimizing the multi-generational LRU, he said, is a tricky task.
Profiling the kernel showed that the use of hardware counters reduced the
time spent checking per-page "accessed" bits, but added time spent querying
the counters.  In summary, he said, it is still not entirely clear whether
this feature is worth adding or not.
<p>
An entirely different use case is measuring the utilization of transparent
huge pages. These pages, which are often made up of 512 4KB "base" pages,
have a single bit tracking references to the whole thing.  If a single base
page within a huge page is active, it make the whole huge page look busy,
even though the other 511 base pages might be unused.  Hardware counters
exist for each base page, though, so they should be able to identify hot
and cold pages hidden within a huge page.
<p>
The approach he is working on changes the <tt>khugepaged</tt> thread, which
"collapses" base pages into huge pages behind the scenes, with the result
that it only creates a huge page if all of the base pages that it contains
have approximately equal access frequencies.  The reclaim process can look
at access patterns for the base pages within a huge page and break that
huge page apart if it is sparsely used.  Benchmarking this work was
tricky, since it is hard to find workloads that show this type of access
pattern.  With a special-purpose microbenchark, though, Kumar was able to
demonstrate that sparsely-used huge pages can be split, freeing little-used
memory for other uses.
<p>
Another potential use for hardware counters is in page promotion, which
relies on being able to detect heavily used pages that should be promoted
to faster storage.  Using hardware counters, the kernel can compare the
relative hotness of pages across NUMA nodes, which is not easily done now.
Kumar has been unable to test this idea, though, since he lacks the
hardware that it would apply to.
<p>
Assuming that there is a place for hardware counters, developers would need
to find the best way to integrate them.  One option, he said, was to add
support to <a href="/Articles/931769/">DAMON</a>, but that approach is hard
to evaluate.  One benchmark he ran showed a 12% performance improvement,
but it also showed a lot of variance.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931917/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/WeiXu-sm.png" alt="[Wei Xu]"
title="Wei Xu" class="rthumb"></a>

Xu took over at this point to return to the question of page promotion,
which he described as a key challenge for memory tiering.  There are
currently a number of ways of identifying hot pages (which are candidates
for promotion) in the kernel, he said, including page faults, accessed-bit
scans, hardware counters, and more.  It would be good to somehow unify the
kernel's approach to hardware-assisted page promotion.
The best approach there, he said, would be to create an abstraction layer
around page promotion that could use a number of back-end modules to
acquire information on page usage.
<p>
He has implemented a user-space
promotion daemon that used a combination of access bits and precise
event-based sampling (PEBS) data, with events streamed to user space by way
of a BPF interface.  In combination with a custom system call to request
the migration of physical pages, he said, it worked "well enough".
<p>
He wondered how this kind of functionality might be brought into the
kernel.  One possibility would be to extend the <a
href="/Articles/488709/">autonuma</a> mechanism to use hardware counters
but, he said, that is not a great fit.  Autonuma is based on virtual memory
areas, while the counters are tied to page-frame numbers.  A better idea,
he thought, was to extend the multi-generational LRU to make use of this
information.  It could be augmented with a per-node page-promotion thread
that works like kswapd, but in the opposition direction.
<p>
Kumar asked the gathered developers how they thought the incorporation of
hardware counters should proceed.  Dan Williams said that user space might
also want to use the system's performance counters; if the kernel grabs
them, those applications could break.  Kumar answered that this would not be
a problem on architectures, like PowerPC, that have dedicated counters for
this purpose.  Williams suggested implementing this functionality for such
hardware first.  Xu added that he had used PEBS for his work because it was
the only thing available, but that dedicated counters are a better solution
and he hoped other vendors would start to provide them.
<p>
DAMON developer SeongJae Park expressed his thanks for the DAMON
integration, which is something that he had been wanting to do himself; he
encouraged the sending of patches.  Kumar said that the patches would be
sent, but remarked that DAMON is difficult to use for generic workloads;
Park answered that he is working on automatic tuning to address that
problem.
<p>
The session closed with a suggestion from Williams that proving the value
of hardware counters in DAMON would be a good first step.  After that, if it
seems worthwhile, support for these counters could be moved into the core
memory-management code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

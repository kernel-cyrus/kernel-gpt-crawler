<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 22, 2011</br>
           </div>
Over the last week or so a number of interesting topics have come up with
regard to the low-level functioning of the block layer.  This article will
survey a few of these topics.
<p>
<b>Enforcing read-only</b>: The block layer has a mechanism by which a
driver can mark a specific device (or partition) as being read-only.  This
flag may be set if the physical device is write-locked; it can also be set
by higher-level code (the DM or MD layers, for example) when the
administrator creates a read-only device.  Tejun Heo discovered an
interesting thing, though: this flag is not enforced within the block
layer.  An attempt to open a write-protected device for write access will
succeed, and the block layer will happily issue write operations to a
read-only device.  That struck Tejun as wrong, so he put a patch for 2.6.38
which addresses part of the problem: an attempt to open a read-only device
for write access will be blocked.
<p>
It turns out, though, that this check breaks things.  Since enforcement of
read-only status has never been done, developers have been careless about
how they open block devices.  So, with this patch in place, the loop
device, device mapper, and MD all break when trying to open a read-only
device, even if the ultimate goal is read-only access.  Breaking things on
this scale is not one of the stated goals of the 2.6.38 development cycle,
so Chuck Ebbert has posted <a href="/Articles/429299/">a patch</a>
reverting the change; some version of this patch is likely to be merged
before the final 2.6.38 release.
<p>
In-kernel code which is careless about open permissions can easily be
fixed, but fixing the user-space utilities will take rather longer.  So
this check probably cannot be put into the <tt>open()</tt> path anytime
soon.  Beyond that, as <a href="/Articles/429301/">Linus pointed out</a>,
it may never really be the right thing to do; there are times when it may
be necessary to open a read-only device for write access.  Real enforcement
of read-only status, if it is to be done in the block layer, probably needs
to happen when operations are actually submitted to the device.  How many
things that would break remains to be seen.
<p>
<b>Stable pages</b>: Linux has had support for <a
href="/Articles/290141/">block data integrity checking</a> since 2008.  In
short, this feature takes advantage of suitably-equipped hardware to ensure
that data is not corrupted between the host and its destination in
persistent storage.  Before writing a block to a device, the kernel will
calculate a checksum and send it with the data; if the data, once written
by the device, no longer matches the checksum, the device will signal an
error.  This mechanism can increase overall confidence that the system is
storing data without corrupting it.
<p>
There is one little problem, though.  Imagine a sequence of events where
the kernel calculates a checksum for a specific block, issues a write
operation, then goes on to do more interesting things.  Before the block
controller gets around to acting on the request, some process comes along
and changes the contents of the block.  At this point, the checksum will no
longer match, and the operation can fail.  What is the best way to respond
to (or, better, prevent) this outcome?
<p>
Darrick Wong has addressed this problem with <a href="/Articles/429305/">a
patch</a> which takes a possibly heavy-handed approach: when integrity
checking is in use, blocks will be copied before the checksum is calculated
and the I/O operation initiated.  The rest of the system can then do
anything it wants with the original data; the data as it existed when the
write operation was queued will be written to the device.  This approach
will certainly work, but the cost is clear: an extra copy operation is
added to the write path.  That is not a cost that sits well with all
developers.
<p>
The proper way to solve this, for some value of "proper," is implementing
"stable pages" within the filesystem code.  In essence: a page which is
under writeout becomes immutable; any process trying to change that page's
contents will block until the write operation is complete.  This solution
is not universally popular either; it is said to have an adverse impact on
at least one
benchmark regardless of whether integrity checking is in use.  As Jan Kara
<a href="/Articles/429306/">noted</a>, the best-performing approach will
not be the same for everybody:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In fact what is going to be faster depends pretty much on your
	system config. If you have enough CPU/RAM bandwidth compared to
	storage speed, you're better [off] doing copying. If you can barely
	saturate storage with your CPU/RAM, waiting is probably better for
	you.
</div>
<p>
Some people also like the fact that the block-copying approach puts the
pain on users of the integrity-checking features while not hurting other
users - assuming that the cost of all those page allocations and copies
doesn't affect anybody else.  That said, stable pages look like they will
be the approach taken in the future; as Martin Petersen <a
href="/Articles/429307/">pointed out</a>, there are a number of filesystem
features - encryption, for example - which depend on it.  Work is underway
to add this capability to a number of filesystems; at the moment, only
Btrfs has proper stable page support.
<p>
<b>Comprehensive block I/O throttling coverage</b>.  Last week's Kernel
Page featured <a href="/Articles/427961/">hierarchical I/O scheduling</a>;
that work fills in an important feature, but the limitations of the (quite
new) bandwidth controller don't stop there.  One of its larger shortcomings
is that it only really works with I/O submitted directly from process
context.  When I/O is initiated by the kernel (in particular, when the
writeback code flushes dirty pages to disk), the controller is unable to
associate the pages with the process that dirtied them.  Since on
many (or most) systems most block I/O writes are generated that way, it is
easy to see that the block I/O controller's coverage is somewhat limited at
the moment.
<p>
Andrea Righi has posted <a href="/Articles/429292/">a patch set</a> which
is meant to lift that limitation by tracking the ownership of all dirty
pages in the system.  There is code in the kernel now which can do that
ownership tracking; the memory usage controller needs that information to
do its job.  So Andrea's patch generalizes the ownership tracking code and
makes it serve the I/O controller's purposes as well.  Half of the existing
<tt>flags</tt> field in <tt>struct page_cgroup</tt> are taken to hold an
index describing which control group the page belongs to.  That makes the
block controller different from how the memory controller uses this
structure - the latter stores a direct pointer to its <tt>mem_cgroup</tt>
structure - but it does have the advantage of not increasing the size of
the <tt>page_cgroup</tt> structure.
<p>
That advantage is not to be undervalued: <tt>struct page_cgroup</tt>
shadows <tt>struct page</tt>, so one can exist for almost every page in the
system.  Even a little bit of overhead adds up quickly when such large
quantities are involved.  That overhead will be the biggest disadvantage of
this new feature; anybody who wants to throttle block I/O bandwidth, and
who is not also using the memory controller, will pay a significant cost in
increased kernel memory use.  The payback is that block I/O throttling
actually works as intended; without page tracking, it can only give
approximate results.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Can't we have a compromise solution where stable pages switch to &ldquo;copy-on-write&rdquo; behavior?</p>
<p>This should permit processes to make progress when they touch pages under writeout (at the cost of a page fault + copy, which may be more acceptable than just blocking&mdash;especially if the block device is slow/busy).</p>

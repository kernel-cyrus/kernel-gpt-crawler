<p>
One thing that is known about using transparent huge pages (THPs) for
filesystems is that it is a hard problem to solve, but is there a solid first
step that 
could be taken toward that goal?  That is the question Song Liu asked to
open his combined 
filesystem and memory-management session at
the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).
His employer, Facebook, has a solid use case for using THPs on files in
the page cache, which may provide a starting point. 
</p>

<p>
THPs reduce translation lookaside buffer (TLB) misses so they provide
better performance.  Facebook is trying to reduce misses on the TLB for
instructions by putting hot functions into huge pages.  It is using the <a
href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/BOLT">Binary Optimization and
Layout Tool</a> (BOLT) to profile its code in order to identify the hot
functions.  Those functions are collected up into an 8MB region in the
generated executable.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/789161/">

</a>

<p>
At run time, the application creates an 8MB temporary buffer and
the hot section of the 
executable memory is copied to it.  The 8MB region in the executable memory
is 
then converted to a huge page (by way of an <tt>mmap()</tt> to anonymous
pages and an
<tt>madvise()</tt> to create a huge page), the data is copied back to it,
and it is made 
executable again using <tt>mprotect()</tt>.  
</p>

<p>
This results in a 5-10% performance boost without requiring any kernel
changes to support it.  But it breaks the symbol addresses and uprobe
targets in the THP region because the kernel has no idea this region is
part of the application any more.  If there were support for THPs in the
filesystem, that whole dance could be eliminated; a simple
<tt>madvise()</tt> could be used.
</p>

<p>
Liu calls making it work without the copy a "baby step" toward THP support
for filesystems. He is working on it, but there are lots of limitations and
simplifications in his approach.  For example, there is no support for
writing to the THP, thus no writeback is required.  That would prove to be
a sticking point.
</p>

<p>
An attendee asked why writing was not supported; is it a performance issue
or a complexity problem?  Johannes Weiner said that adding write support
would mean touching all of the places where a page is expected.  In
particular, all of the filesystems would need to change to support write.
Instead of a "massive patch" that would update everything at the same time,
this is simply a first step, not a permanent solution.
</p>

<p>
There were concerns expressed by Kirill Shutemov and Matthew Wilcox about
merging something that did not support writing.  For the Facebook use case,
writing is not needed at all, Chris Mason said, but that is not a general
enough solution, Wilcox said.  Rik van Riel said that everyone needed to
keep in mind that it will be impossible to merge all of the feature at
onceâ€”it will be too big of a patch set.  So there is a need to identify the
first steps to take.  But Shutemov and Wilcox were adamant that nothing
should be added to kernel unless writing to the THP was supported.
</p>

<p>
Wilcox said that some of the <a href="/Articles/787388/">changes he is
working on</a> for the page cache 
may help simplify the problem for filesystems.  In particular, eliminating
functions that return tail pages for <a href="/Articles/619514/">compound
pages</a>, so that the filesystem code only needs to deal with head pages,
will help.  He suggested waiting for that work to get finished before
proceeding further down the THP for filesystems path; Shutemov agreed with
that approach.  That may not have been quite what Liu was looking for from
the session, but Facebook will presumably keep using its approach in the
interim.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 23, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
At the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Hannes Reinecke led a plenary session
ostensibly dedicated to the "limits of development".  The actual discussion
focused on the frustrations of the kernel development process as
experienced by both developers and maintainers.  It is probably fair to say
that no problems were solved here, but perhaps the nature of some of the
challenges is a bit more clear.
<p>
Reinecke started with the topic of patch sets that are proposed by their
author, but do not end up being either applied or rejected.  Or perhaps a
patch set will be rejected after the developer has put the work into
posting numerous revisions.  Meanwhile, other patches that are seemingly
just as intrusive are accepted without problems.  This unpredictability
makes it hard for companies — even those that are relatively deeply
involved with the kernel community — to know what will happen when they
start on a development project.
<p>
Nobody wants to spend a lot of time on a project that will end up being
rejected.  He hasn't been able to come up with guidelines for these
developers other than to say that, if they approach the maintainer at the
wrong time, their work will not get in.  This seems somewhat inadequate, so
he would like to find a way to apply the brakes early for work that has
fundamental problems and will not find acceptance.
<p>
Josef Bacik said that the Btrfs community has put some effort into
addressing this problem.  As the patch counts have gone up, the community
has gotten better at figuring out how and when patches go in; this took a
lot of effort from the maintainers and technical leaders.  An effort has
been made to provide early indications of whether a project is worth doing
and, if it is, to put in the work to shepherd the project along.
<p>
A lot of kernel maintainers, he continued, see their subsystem as their
own fiefdom and don't care much about work from other developers.  Meanwhile,
drive-by authors don't know who they should be paying attention to; this is
a fundamental problem in our community.  Maintainer behavior can be erratic
and inconsistent.  We should be able to work better together, he said.
Getting there requires a more clear definition of what the maintainer's
role is.  It is not just accepting patches.  A maintainer should provide
clear indications to newcomers, provide feedback on ideas, and ensure that
patches get reviews.  The Btrfs developers get together regularly to talk
about their work, but there is no equivalent forum for the wider community.
<p>
Steve Rostedt mentioned the kernel's communication-style documentation,
which is currently being (slowly) rethought by the Linux Foundation
Technical Advisory Board.  Our documentation on how maintainers talk to
developers can stand improvement, but there is also a place for a document
on how contributors should talk to maintainers.  Reinecke answered that all
of this implies that people actually talk to each other.
<p>
Bacik said that communication style matters.  Anybody who has been in his
presence for long knows that he tends toward the use of profanity when he
speaks.  But he has made a point of not doing that on the mailing lists; he
never knows how it will be perceived, especially by people who do not know
him.  It could cause contributors to decide to stay away from the
community.  We should all make a similar effort to be more welcoming, he
said.  He also expressed unhappiness about people who continue to fight
over things that have been settled; he mentioned BPF and systemd as
examples.  We are all moving in the same direction, he said, and should
pretend that we like each other.
<p>
Reinecke asked if the problem is just one of communication.  A pattern he
has often seen is where the relevant parties enter a discussion late, then
dig in their heels.  Bacik said that it's the maintainer's job to steer a
project; that includes looking at random patch sets and giving feedback.  A
flat refusal to accept a patch is not helpful; the author had a use case in
mind and didn't write the code just for fun.  They are trying to accomplish
something, and the maintainer should make the effort to understand why.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that running the project has to be a team effort; if the onus
is put just on the maintainers, they will burn out.  Maintainers simply
cannot review all of the patches that hit the lists; they are dependent on
others to help with that work.  One cannot demand a service-level agreement
from a volunteer maintainer.  Few maintainers, he said, do that work as a
full-time job.
<p>
Kent Overstreet said that developers want quick feedback.  Reviewers often
think that every review has to be highly detailed; that is demanding and
slows down the process.  Christian Brauner answered that some patches
really do require deep review, and that just doesn't scale.  Sometimes, he
said, we just have to accept code that is not perfect.
<p>
Brauner said that he would like to see more patches with Reviewed-by tags.
In his experience, potential reviewers worry that their tag will make them
look bad if a bug is found in the patch later on.  But bugs happen, he said,
and they don't mean that a reviewer hasn't done their job.  Dan Williams
said that we are all managing our reputations in the community, and that
can cause people to hesitate; maintainers need to engage with contributors,
but the contributors also have to give the maintainers some space.
Maintainers, he said, should talk to each other more and not be afraid to
ask for help.  There is also value in having regular phone calls. Most of a
project's communication channels are public and archived; having a more
private channel can put people at ease.
<p>
James Bottomley asked whether the community is sufficiently encouraging of
reviews.  In the past there have been problems with people giving bad
advice, leading the community to clamp down somewhat.  But perhaps the
correction has gone a little too far?  Brauner said that a maintainer will
only get reviews if they encourage reviewers; if you see somebody who is
doing good work, write to them and ask them to continue.  We are good at
saying something is wrong, he said, but not so good at saying when
something is right.
<p>
As the session ran out of time, Bottomley asked how a potential reviewer
might get the "R" tag in the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file that will cause them
to be copied on patches.  In most subsystems, it seems that the reviewer
has to explicitly ask for it.
<p>
At that point, the session came to a close.  It is not clear that a whole
lot was achieved in the discussion, but it did at least give maintainers a
chance to talk about their frustrations for a bit.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In my humble opinion, I think is very ... poor behavior to invoke the uber-init/mega-OS at an unrelated convention. Seems like going out of one's way to bring up an unrelated hot topic.<br>
<p>
Unrelated to behavior norms comments: I think it would be good if subsystems had more "reviewers", maybe something like an extensions to the MAINTANERS file, and get_maintainer.pl, except that it could give you a list of people you can send to to review a patch.<br>
<p>
I know the few times I've tried sending patches, it feels like the list of destinations isn't very good (and I guess some maintainers are either no-shows or totally overwhelmed)<br>

      <p>Calling it poor behaviour is highlighting the problem that Bacik was drawing attention to; there are things that make heavy use of the kernel, and thus it's reasonable to mention them in the context of kernel changes. If some of them are deemed "too controversial" to discuss, then we have a communication problem - making people contort their examples to hide the fact that they're doing something based on the output of <tt>systemd-analyze</tt> or because they have an I/O trace from a system that's showing systemd doing something reasonable that's gone slow is problematic in itself.

<p>
I'm sorry that when I said "unrelated" I didn't get the point across. He said explicitly talking about "settled issues".<br>
<p>
I was suggesting that what user space programs peoples use... in user space can not be a "settled" issue from the kernels perspective. And attempting to assert that at a kernel convention is just throwing provocation out there, and actually detracts from constructive conversation.<br>
<p>
I would suggest that bringing up known hot-topics ... that aren't related to the issues at hand is... a communication problem.<br>
<p>
Talking about user space programs interacting when (regardless of how you feel about the specific program in question) is obviously related... however that wasn't the topic (at least far as LWN covered).<br>
<p>
The rest of the examples given seem at least unrelated. Perhaps your suggesting that that the kernel community reacts poorly to people submitting patches for problems discovered while using a systemd based system? That isn't mentioned in the article (and so talking about it becomes tangential), so I won't speculate about things which I have no knowledge of.<br>

      <p>I think you're demonstrating the exact problem Bacik is talking about - by trying to turn the use of systemd as init into a controversial issue, when to everyone else it's settled that many (if not most) Linux kernel users use systemd as init is the norm.
<p>From the kernel's point of view, that people will use systemd as their init system should be seen as a settled issue - shouting "no! bad! systemd is not a good init system!" is just derailing the conversation, even though there are people who genuinely believe that systemd isn't a good init system to use.

It's safe to say that nobody in the room blinked at the mention of systemd.  It's not controversial except amongst a handful of zealots. The conversation was not derailed.  It wasn't provocative.<br>

Are you aware that you are *perfectly* demonstrating the communication problem that was talked about?<br>

That the majority of Linux distributions use systemd *is* a settled issue -- and I say this as someone who doesn't like systemd. It's like spilled milk, get over it.<br>

My point on code review was that if developers aren't getting feedback until a super thorough line by line review is done, that's a bit of a problem.<br>
<p>
Especially if the high level "what is this approach, and is this the right approach" discussion isn't happening - we can be overly focused on details.<br>
<p>
Being too detail focused leads to maintainers being slow to give _any_ feedback - or worse, just giving vague negative feedback when they haven't had the time to look at a patch enough to be comfortable with it.<br>
<p>
Code review discussions shouldn't just (or perhaps even mainly) be about finding every last bug. They should be about talking about different approaches, understanding what people are trying to do, and making sure more junior engineers have the tools they need and are on the right track.<br>

Absolutely agree. Though in my experience outside of the FLOSS community, it's really hard to get humans to engage in that way. In my experience they either need to be interested in that exact project, or have a (rare) aptitude for bounce good ideas/approaches around<br>

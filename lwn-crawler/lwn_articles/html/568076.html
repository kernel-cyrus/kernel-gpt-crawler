Once upon a time, the standard response to scalability problems in the
kernel was the introduction of finer-grained locking.  That approach has
its problems, though: the cache-line bouncing that locking
activity creates can be a scalability problem in its own right.  So much of
the scalability work in the kernel has, in recent years, been focused on
lockless algorithms instead.  But, 
sometimes, there is little alternative to the introduction of finer-grained
locks; a current memory management patch set illustrates one of those
situations, with some additional complications.
<p>
Page tables hold the mapping between a virtual address in some process's
address space and the physical location of the memory behind that address.
It is easy to think of the page table as a simple linear array indexed by
the page frame number, but the reality is more complicated: page tables are
implemented as a sparse tree with up to four levels.  Various subfields of
a virtual address are used to progress through the tree as shown here:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/address-translation.png" width=673 height=292
alt="[Virtual address translation]">
</blockquote>
<p>
Some systems do not have all four levels; no 32-bit system has the PUD
("page upper directory") level, for example, and some 32-bit systems may
still get by with two-level page tables.  Kernel code is written to deal
with all four levels, though; the extra code will vanish in the compilation
state for configurations with fewer levels.
<p>
Changes to page tables can be made frequently; every movement of a page
into or out of RAM must be reflected there, as must changes to the virtual
address 
space (such as those made via an <tt>mmap()</tt> call).  If the page table
is not shared 
across processes, there is little potential for contention (and, thus, for
scalability problems), since only one process will be making changes
there.  Sharing of the page tables, as happens most frequently in threaded
workloads, changes the picture, though; it is not uncommon for threads to
be making concurrent page table changes.  The more concurrently running
threads there are, the higher the potential for contention becomes.
<p>
In some configurations, the entire page table is protected by a single
spinlock (called <tt>page_table_lock</tt>) in the process's
<tt>mm_struct</tt> structure.  That lock was recognized as a scalability
problem years ago; in response, locking for the lowest level of the page
table tree (the PTE — "page table entry" — pages) was made per-PTE-page for
multiprocessor 
configurations.  But all of the other layers of the page table tree are
still protected by <tt>page_table_lock</tt>; in general, changes at those
levels are rare enough that more sophisticated locking is not worth the
trouble.
<p>
There is only one problem: as Kirill A Shutemov has <a
href="/Articles/566770/">pointed out</a>, that is not always true.  When
huge pages are in use, the PTE level of the page table tree is omitted.
Instead, the entry in the next level up — the "page middle directory" or
PMD — points directly to a much larger page.  So,
in effect, huge pages prune the page table tree back to three levels, with
the PMD becoming the lowest level. The elimination of one level of
translation is one of the reasons why huge pages can improve performance,
though this effect is likely overshadowed by the large increase in the
coverage of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), which avoids a lot of
address translations altogether.
<p>
What Kirill has noted is that highly threaded workloads slow down
considerably when the <a href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge
pages</a> feature is in use.  Given that huge pages are meant to increase
performance, this result is seen as surprising and undesirable.  The
problem is contention for the <tt>page_table_lock</tt>; the use of lots of
huge pages greatly increases the number of changes made at the PMD level
and, thus, increases contention.  To address this problem, Kirill has put
together a 
patch set that pushes the locking down to the PMD level, eliminating much
of that contention.
<p>
Locks are normally embedded within the data structures they protect, so one
might be inclined to put a spinlock into the PMD.  But the PMD is a
hardware-defined structure; it is simply a page full of pointers to PTE
pages or huge pages, with some status bits.  There is no place there for an
added spinlock, so that lock must go somewhere else.  When fine-grained
locking was implemented at the PTE level, the same problem was encountered;
the solution was to shoehorn the lock into the already overcrowded
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, which is the core structure for tracking the
system's physical memory.  (See <a href="/Articles/565097/">this article</a>
for details on how <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> is put together).  Kirill's
patch replicates the approach used at the PTE level, putting the lock into
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>.
<p>
The results would appear to be reasonably convincing.  A benchmark designed
to demonstrate the problem runs in 36.5 seconds with transparent huge pages
off.  When transparent huge pages are turned on in an unmodified kernel,
the number of 
page faults drops from over 24&nbsp;million to 50,000, but the run time
increases to 49.9 seconds — not the speed improvement that one might hope
for.  Adding the patch, though, cuts the run time to 33.9 seconds,
significantly faster than an unmodified kernel without transparent huge
pages.  By getting rid of the cost of the 
locking contention at the PMD level, Kirill's patch allows the benchmark to
enjoy the performance benefits that come from using huge pages.
<p>
There is one remaining problem, as <a href="/Articles/568090/">pointed
out</a> by Peter Zijlstra: the patch as written will not work with the
realtime preemption patch set.  In the realtime world, spinlocks are
sleeping locks; that makes them bigger, to the point that they will no
longer fit into the tight space available in <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>.
That structure will grow to accommodate the larger lock, but, given that
there is one <tt>page</tt> structure for every page in the system, the
memory cost of that growth is difficult to accept.  The realtime developers
resolved this problem at the PTE level by allocating the lock separately
and putting a pointer into <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>.
<p>
Something similar can certainly be done for the PMD-level locking.  But, as
Peter pointed out, the lock allocation means that the initialization of PMD
pages is now subject to out-of-memory failures, complicating the code
considerably.  He hoped that the new code could be written with the
assumption that PMD construction could fail so that the realtime tree would
not have to carry a complicated add-on patch.  Kirill is not required to
cater to the needs of an out-of-tree patch set, but it's still nicer to
avoid making life difficult for the realtime people if it can be avoided.
So chances are, there will be another version of this set coming in the
near future.
<p>
Beyond that, though, this work appears to be mostly complete and in good
shape.  It could, thus, find its way into a mainline kernel sometime in the
relatively near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      A pointer in struct page to a mutex elsewhere makes the problem worse, unless there are many fewer mutexes than pages pointing to them.
<p>
Instead of a lock for each struct page, it should suffice to have a global, fixed-size table of mutexes, with the mutex for a particular page identified by hashing the page identifier. The mutex table just needs to be large compared to the number of CPUs, not the number of pages.  Yes, sharing a mutex among multiple pages increases contention, but that can be tuned.
<p>
Growing struct page invites apocalypse.

      <P>I had the same thought:  It must be a much smaller pool of locks that<TT> struct page </TT>points to, otherwise the indirection only bought you the cost (both time and space) of indirection.</P>
<P>This was one place I was hoping for a link to an LWN article or other thread that explained what as on the other side of that pointer.  (I admit, because I didn't want to try to decode the code myself.)</P>

      "Many fewer mutexes than pages pointing to them" is pretty much the situation.  Remember, these locks are only needed for pages holding page tables, not for pages in general.

<h1>Standardizing the BPF ISA</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Daroc Alden</b><br>May 30, 2024</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
While BPF may be most famous for its use in the Linux kernel, there is actually
a growing effort to standardize BPF for use on other systems. These include
<a href="/Articles/857215/">
eBPF for Windows</a>, but also
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf">
uBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf">
rBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rprinz08/hBPF">
hBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime">
bpftime</a>, and
others. Some hardware manufacturers are even
considering integrating BPF directly into networking hardware. Dave Thaler
led two sessions about all of the problems that cross-platform use inevitably
brings and the current status of the standardization work at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thaler opened the first session (on the first day of the summit) by discussing
the many platforms that are now capable of running BPF. With multiple compilers
and runtimes, there are inevitable compatibility problems. He defined
the goal of the
<a href="/Articles/926882">
ongoing IETF BPF standardization work</a> as trying to ensure that
any compiler can be used with any compliant runtime. He then went into a bit
more detail about what "compliant" means in this specific context, which
required first explaining a bit of background about the structure of the
standardization documents.
</p>

</a>

<p>
In his later session, Thaler would go into more detail about the exact state of
the first IETF draft from the working group; for the initial session, he merely
stated that the working group had produced
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-bpf-isa/">
a draft instruction set architecture</a>
(ISA) specification for BPF. That
draft defines the semantics of all of the BPF instructions. One wrinkle is that
different implementations may not actually care about implementing every BPF
instruction. For example, BPF started off with some instructions that are
particular to its initial use case as a packet-filtering language; those
packet-filtering instructions might not actually be useful to BPF code running in other contexts.

</blockquote>
<p>
The draft ISA splits the defined instructions into sets of "conformance groups".
A compliant runtime, then, is one that correctly implements the specified
instructions for all of the conformance groups it claims to support. Splitting
things up in this way helps runtimes (and compilers) communicate exactly what
they support, Thaler explained.
</p>

<p>
The draft ISA splits the existing instructions into
groups largely modeled after the RISC-V ISA: atomic32, atomic64, base32,
base64, divmul32, divmul64, and packet. Some of these groups include other
groups — for example, any implementation claiming to implement base64 must also
implement base32. In fact, all of the 64-bit groups include their
32-bit counterparts. Any new instructions that get added to BPF in the future will
be added to a new conformance group, so existing groups will never be modified.
That means that once an implementation has become compliant, it doesn't
necessarily need to stay up to date with new changes to BPF; it can continue
claiming compatibility with the old instruction groups and leave things there.
</p>

<p>
Thaler also described the process that the working group has settled on for
deprecations. If a group of instructions needs to be deprecated for whatever
reason, they'll be added to a separate conformance group, and then new
implementations can explicitly <em>exclude</em> that group and still be
considered compliant. A compiler processing a BPF program will need to receive a
set of conformance groups implemented by the target (either via compiler flags
or other configuration), and take care to emit only supported instructions. The
base32 group, which must be supported by all implementations, is
already fairly broad, so code generation should not be much of an issue.
Hopefully the end result for users will be seamless
compatibility.
</p>

<p>
Instructions are not the only component of BPF, however. Another area requiring
standardization is the platform-specific application binary interface (psABI),
which includes details such as which
registers are saved across a call, which register contains the frame pointer, how
large the stack is, and other details, Thaler said. This is all a lot more up in the air, because the
working group has not put together a draft of a psABI specification yet. He
also floated the possibility that there might end up being multiple psABIs, in
which case compilers would need to either choose one to support, or allow some
way to specify which one would be used for code generation.
</p>

<p>
José Marchesi objected to the idea that the frame pointer was a
choice that ought to be left to the psABI — BPF uses automatic stack allocation,
meaning that the runtime manages the frame pointer in BPF register <tt>r10</tt>.
Thaler responded that the ISA doesn't actually say that; the unwritten psABI
would need to say that. Marchesi wasn't satisfied with that explanation, since
<tt>r10</tt> is treated differently from the other registers. In particular, it
is read-only. There was some additional discussion of the point, but other
members of the audience didn't seem to agree with Marchesi that the behavior of
<tt>r10</tt> ought to be specified in the ISA.
</p>

<p>
At that point, Thaler moved on to addressing another point of compatibility
unique to BPF: the verifier. There already exist multiple BPF verifiers, notably
the one in the Linux kernel and the <a
href="https://vbpf.github.io/">PREVAIL</a>
verifier. A compiler hoping to
produce portable BPF code would need an actual description of what code is or is
not verifiable. That is something the working group has been considering, but
has not yet written any draft specifications about.
</p>

<h4>The state of the standard</h4>

<p>
In his second session, late on the last day of the summit, Thaler updated
everyone on the current state of the ISA standard. He began the session by
explaining what it is the working group is chartered to do: produce a set of
standards and informational documents on several specific topics. How the working
group does that is up to them — so they could work on these documents in
parallel, but have generally been pursuing them in priority order.
</p>

<p>
Because having an ISA is foundational to being able to discuss other topics such
as the psABI and requirements for the verifier, the ISA is the first document
the working group has been focusing on. At the time of the session, the ISA was
"almost done", with the last call for comments ending the next day. As of this
writing, the ISA is on the agenda for
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2024-iesg-13/session/iesg">
the June 13 meeting</a> of the Internet
Engineering Steering Group (IESG).
</p>

<p>
To people not well versed in IETF minutiae,
that might not provide a clear picture of what the state of the document
actually is; Thaler provided a brief overview of the remaining process as it
applies to the BPF ISA.
At the June 13 meeting, the IESG will vote on the proposed document. If it fails
to pass, any questions or comments will go
back to the working group, the document will be revised, and then it will return
to the IESG at a later date. If the vote passes, the document enters the RFC
editor's queue. The RFC editor converts the document to the specific format for
RFCs, updates any references, and assigns it a tentative RFC number. Then the
authors have a final chance to review the RFC editor's changes before it is
published, and the assigned number becomes final.
</p>

<p>
In parallel, the document also needs to be reviewed by the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA), because IANA will become responsible for managing the
official list of conformance groups. Thaler described IANA as comprised of "process people",
who are unlikely to raise any objections to the document as long as the
procedure described for registering new conformance groups does not have any problems.
</p>

<p>
All parts of that process are fairly fast, except waiting on the IESG, which
only meets every two weeks. So it is quite likely that the BPF ISA may be an
official RFC by the end of June, he said. David Vernet, the chair of the working group,
asked Thaler whether there was anything that the assembled BPF developers could
do to prevent delays. Thaler said that there was not, since it was all waiting
on the IETF — except for providing fast responses to feedback.
</p>

<p>
In particular, Thaler had already received some feedback during the last call
for comments. Since the comment period was scheduled to end the next day, he
thought that if the attendees quickly replied to these concerns, there would likely not
be any other delays. He went through the feedback, most of which was minor and
already incorporated. One piece of feedback
prompted actual discussion, however. Eric Klein had
suggested that the ISA should not define the range of registers available to BPF
programs, saying that should be moved to the (not yet written) psABI instead.
This suggestion was not well received.
</p>

<p>
Several audience members, including Marchesi, spoke up to say that the number of
registers a CPU has should always be part of the ISA. One audience member asked
how compilers are supposed to produce code for a platform without knowing how
many registers there are. Marchesi and Alexei Starovoitov separately mentioned that
there were some details of how registers were used, such as the use of
<tt>r0</tt> for return values, or the use of the frame pointer, that did not
necessarily need to be included in the ISA, but still thought the number of
valid registers was important to include. Thaler noted everyone's responses, and
intends to keep the number of registers (currently eleven — ten general purpose
and one read-only frame pointer) in the ISA.
</p>

<p>
Vernet then questioned why they should standardize on eleven registers — other than
to match the existing behavior of BPF implementations. Another member of
the audience said that was a "very good question, but not one that should affect
the standard", given that this is what all existing portable BPF programs do.
Marchesi suggested that the ISA could say that the instruction encoding has
space for up to 16 registers, but that the exact number depends on the
implementation, with a minimum of eleven.
Several other people pushed to move on with eleven as-is, noting that if this were
a real issue it would have come up at some point before the final 48 hours of
the last call for comments on the ISA.
</p>

<p>
Once the ISA is standardized, the next step (although he was clear that this was only a
rough order), will be an informational standard describing the expectations for
a BPF verifier. This might include ensuring properties like not using undefined
instructions, not dereferencing invalid pointers, or ensuring that programs
terminate. Marchesi noted that it would be convenient for compilers if the
document took the form of a numbered or named list of rules, so that compiler
error messages (and internal code) can reference them by name. Starovoitov
thought that those kinds of requirements belonged in a separate document; Thaler
concurred, noting that a compiler expectations document was later in his list.
Other upcoming tasks for the working group includes standardizing the BPF Type
Format (BTF), and informational documents on producing portable binaries —
including documenting compiler expectations for verifiable code, and the psABI.
</p>

<p>
Thaler spoke a bit about his preferred form for the psABI work, and then moved
into one last topic for the audience to help with: an ELF profile for BPF. He
has
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thaler-bpf-elf/">
a draft proposal</a>, but he has concerns about
the right way to perform the standardization. ELF is not an IETF standard —
it is defined as part of
<a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi41.pdf">
the System V specifications</a>. So, he asked, what is the right way to
register BPF-specific ELF information (like the BPF CPU identifier in the ELF headers)?
</p>

<p>
The consensus among the audience was that System V was
<a href="https://maskray.me/blog/2024-05-26-evolution-of-elf-object-file-format">
pretty much defunct</a>, and
that sending an email claiming the BPF CPU
ID to the System V mailing list should be sufficient. With that, the session came to a
close.

Is it possible to run the PREVAIL verifier (or the Linux one for that matter) without trying to load the BPF program into the kernel?   In other words, can these verifiers be run as standalone binaries, or via libraries that non-kernel applications can address?   It would be great to be able to invoke a verifier from a build rule or a test script as part of CI.  Doing so would greatly speed up code development.<br>

On Linux, Docker is a container, so it's running the host's Linux kernel (with all the security implications thereof).   Presumably therefore a Linux Docker container won't run on other hosts, but my ignorance of Windows and MacOs is total.  <br>

      <blockquote><em>Isn't "Docker on Windows or MacOS" simply a Linux VM under the hood?</em></blockquote>
<p>
On Linux, Docker containers are glorified chroot environments. On a non-Linux machine, you need to somehow bring in the underlying Linux bits that support the glorified chroot environment, and a VM is one reasonable way of doing this.

So from someone who has heard of both but used neither, if my project needs some small virtual machine for whatever reason, when and why should I choose BPF instead of WASM and vice versa?<br>

You should use the BPF VM if you are writing code inside the Linux kernel (you're not going to be able to get a WASM VM accepted there). You might also want to use a BPF VM if you would benefit from the ability to run programs originally written in BPF for the Linux kernel's BPF VM.<br>
<p>
In all other contexts, use a WASM VM.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 9, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
Two different topics concerning the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer were the
subject of a session led by VFS co-maintainer Christian Brauner at the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>.  As might be guessed, it was a
filesystem-track session; Brauner had three separate items he planned on
bringing up, but the discussion on the first two consumed the whole
half-hour—and then some.  A mechanism to avoid media-change races when
mounting loop (or loopback) and other devices was disposed of fairly
quickly, but the 
discussion around the mount-beneath feature went on at length.
</p>

<h4>Diskseq</h4>

<p>
There is an issue for container runtimes, Brauner began, because they use a
lot of loop devices, but the backing file for a device can change  without
notification to the runtime.  It is a
longstanding problem, but Christoph Hellwig came up with the idea of providing
a monotonically increasing disk sequence number, which can be used to
detect media changes.  It would also be useful to detect that a USB storage
device has been removed and a new one inserted.
</p>

<p>
The value of the sequence number would be queried using the
<tt>BLKGETDISKSEQ</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command, which means that
user-space processes could detect when loop (and other) devices have
changed their media.  There would also be entries in a new
<tt>/dev/disk/by-diskseq/</tt> directory so that disks can be referenced by
their 
sequence number.  This "eliminates a bunch of races, but not all of them",
Brauner said.  
</p>

<a href="/Articles/934249/">

height=280>
</a>

<p>
There is a kind of a time-of-check-to-time-of-use race that can
still occur, which could lead to the wrong media getting mounted.  He has
pitched an idea to Hellwig to add a "source-diskseq" property to
<tt>fsconfig()</tt>; before the actual mount occurs, the source and
the source-diskseq properties could both be verified for the block device,
ensuring that only the proper media is actually mounted.
</p>

<p>
In general, Brauner thinks that these changes are uncontroversial, but he wanted
to run them by attendees.  One implication of the changes is that
block-backed filesystems that have not yet been switched over to the <a
href="/Articles/759499/">new mount API</a>
will need to be.  He is fine with doing the work to make that happen.  Once
it is done, there is still a bit of work that needs to be done on the block
layer to support the sequence numbers. 
</p>

<p>
Josef Bacik asked how many filesystems still needed to be converted ("other
than one specific filesystem that we know about").  Brauner said that he
was not sure, he just assumed that some still exist. Bacik said that he
would be doing the conversion for Btrfs "next week, honest", which was met
with a good bit of laughter.  Brauner said he could probably do it, if
needed, but Bacik said he had multiple requests for switching Btrfs, so he
would be getting to it soon.
</p>

<p>
Lennart Poettering suggested that mounted filesystems should also be
checking the sequence number to ensure that something surprising has not
happened underneath them.  Ted Ts'o said that Hellwig has sent patches that
would provide a mechanism for the block layer to inform a filesystem that
the media has changed, so that the filesystem can simply shut down.  It is
better if the filesystem is informed about an eject (i.e. media-removed)
event, rather than having to check frequently to see if the sequence number
has changed.
</p>

<h4>Mount beneath</h4>

<p>
The second topic that Brauner wanted to discuss was the mount-beneath
(formerly <a href="/Articles/927491/">filesystem tucking</a>) operation.
It is a way to upgrade or replace a mount by mounting a new filesystem
beneath the one being replaced in the mount stack, so that the underlying
mount point is not 
exposed in the process.  There is a tricky requirement, however, he said,
in that it needs to mesh well with <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/sharedsubtree.html">mount
propagation</a>. 
</p>

<p>
One use case is for containers with a shared <tt>/usr</tt> that gets
periodically updated.  Without the new feature, each update of
<tt>/usr</tt> means that the new one gets mounted atop the existing stack of
previous versions; a system with&nbsp;1000 containers and five updates
has&nbsp;5000 mount entries.  Alternatively, unmounting the old
<tt>/usr</tt> first leaves a window in which the underlying mount point is
exposed to the services in the container.
</p>

<p>
The mount-beneath feature was the easiest way that he came up with to avoid
those problems when updating filesystems.  The kernel walks the mount stack
for a given mount point to find the topmost mount and then it inserts the
new mount just below the topmost.  Then the topmost mount can be unmounted
and users will never see any lower mounts or the mount point; they either
see the topmost mount or the new mount.  It is a way to replace a
mount without falling into all of the complexities that would come from
actually directly doing a mount-replace operation, he said.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o asked how beneath mounts interacted with <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">overlayfs</a>.
Brauner said that there should be no problems with that because the
overlayfs mount includes all of its constituent filesystems into a single
mount.  So a new overlayfs can be mounted beneath an existing one without
any difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Brauner demonstrated the feature, which is a bit hard to describe; those
interested may want to see it in the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnLOrJb02yc">YouTube video of the
session</a> (right around&nbsp;14:08).  He wanted to show that when
mounting multiple times, there is an amplification effect due to mount
propagation.  If the parent mount and the child mount are in the same peer
group, they propagate to each other.  Stacking a bunch of identical mounts
on top each other sets up something approaching a combinatorial explosion
of mounts
due to mount 
propagation.  He is unsure if these semantics were intended, but wanted to
avoid that for beneath mounts.
</p>

<p>
David Howells asked if it would be easier to have a "swap mount" operation
that would switch an existing mount for a new one.  Brauner said that is
effectively the same as the replace operation he had already mentioned.  If
a mount that is being replaced has child mounts (on subdirectories), they
would need to be 
moved to the replacement, which may or may not have the right child mount
points. Mount beneath neatly sidesteps that problem by leaving the problem
of what to do with the child mounts up to user space; before it can unmount
the old filesystem, it will need to do something with the child mounts.
</p>

<p>
Howells was concerned that inserting a mount into the stack, as proposed
for mount beneath, would cause
problems, but Brauner said that can already happen today.  There are ways
to insert a mount beneath another.  Since that does not cause a problem
today, he believes that it will not be one for beneath mounts. 
He demonstrated some of that around&nbsp;19:30 in the video as well.
</p>

<p>
Remote participant Al Viro pointed out that a child mount on, say,
<tt>/usr/local</tt> in the 
old to-be-updated filesystem could get lost when using mount beneath.  Once
a new <tt>/usr</tt> was inserted below, unmounting the old <tt>/usr</tt>
will only succeed if it is a lazy unmount but then the old
<tt>/usr/local</tt> is no longer accessible.  It is inconvenient to have to
mount <tt>local</tt> (and any other mounts on <tt>/usr</tt> subdirectories)
on the new <tt>/usr</tt> before doing the mount beneath operation, but that
is what has to be done to preserve the hierarchy.  Brauner agreed that was
the case, but he does not see it as a big problem.
</p>

<p>
Viro said that the new <tt>/usr</tt> could be mounted somewhere accessible,
each of the subdirectory mounts on the existing <tt>/usr</tt> could then be
bind-mounted to the new in the right places.  After that, the new one could
be mounted beneath the old and the old could be lazily unmounted.  Brauner
thought that all of that should work with the existing mount-beneath feature.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion between Viro and Brauner about the propagation
problem that was demonstrated.  Brauner avoids that in his patches for
mount beneath by 
simply returning an error if this mount-propagation explosion is going to
happen.  Viro did not seem to be opposed to that approach. 
</p>

<p>
Brauner struggled to describe some of the scenarios that could occur, not
because he did not understand them, but because it is difficult to do so in
words with limited examples from his computer screen.  Viro cautioned that
it would be extremely important to fully document the intended behavior,
corner cases, and such, because reconstructing them from the code "will be
unbearably hard".  Brauner said he had a&nbsp;1600-line file that describes
all of the corner cases, just for his own reference; he agreed that
comments in the code and documentation will be imperative.
</p>

<p>
Brauner also poked Howells about his promise to provide documentation for
the new mount API system calls.  Brauner said that he has been a strong
proponent of switching user-space programs to use the new API, has made the
switch 
for a few projects, and that other projects (e.g. systemd) had switched as
well; one of the main stumbling blocks is that he has to spend a lot of
time explaining how the new system calls work.  Viro apologized, though
Brauner (and Howells) seemed to think the fault lay elsewhere.  With luck,
that gentle prod will spur work to finish up the documentation and get it
merged.

<p>
Note that this was a slip of the tongue. The idea of diskseq was actually Lennart's, Matteo Croce (MSFT at the time) implemented it in the kernel (Hellwig reviewed and merged it, from whence came the confusion) and I implemented the userspace side in udev and systemd. Most likely unnecessary to cover all this in the article, but would be good to remove that reference for correctness sake.<br>

Uh, not sure what this his to do with this article, but I'll bite anyway: the great thing about unifying all vendor resources in /usr/ is that you can have a single immutable vendor supplied tree that is fully separated from the local, writable resources in /etc/, /var and the rest of the root dir. It would not be smart to make that wonderful separation go away, and lumping the whole contents into /usr/ with no clear logic anymore about who owns what.<br>

The irony here is that the word Lennartism was introduced in this thread by mezcalero, who is none other than... himself (unless I'm mistaken, in which case the joke is on me)<br>

      Not only can <code>/usr</code> be immutable, it can be an dm-verity volume that is digitally signed and whose hash is measured into the TPM.  This allows desktop systems to finally have proper verified boot, which Android and ChromiumOS have had for years.

      <code>/dev/disk/by-diskseq</code> should really be implemented as part of devtmpfs in the kernel, which avoids most of the races.  All symlinks generated by udev would target the corresponding <code>/dev/disk/by-diskseq/*</code> paths.

<h1>Containers and PID virtualization</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 17, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The folks at IBM would like to add a "container" capability to the Linux
kernel.  Containers are a way of walling a group of processes off from the
rest of the system; a process within a container will only see its fellow
inmate processes and whatever resources are made accessible to that
container.  This feature has some obvious security-related applications.
IBM's plans, evidently, also include the ability to pack up a container and
move it to another physical host without disrupting the processes trapped
inside.
<p>

The patches which have been circulating so far fall short of the final plan,
but they already disturb enough code to have attracted some skeptical
criticism.  In particular, the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/168068/">34-part PID virtualization patch</a>
creates a simple container type, and implements a separate process ID space
within containers.  But, as we'll see, doing even that much involves some
significant kernel changes.
<p>

The containers themselves are fairly simple.  The patches create a virtual
file called <tt>/proc/container</tt>.  If a process writes a string to that
file, a new container is created for that process, using the string as its
name.  The namespace is global, so every container on the system must have
a unique name.  Any child processes created by the newly-contained process
will also be trapped within the container, with no way out.
<p>

At this point, being inside a container does not affect a process's life
that much.  The one thing that does change, however, is that each container
has its own process ID (PID) space.  Processes within the container can
only see others in the same container.  There is nothing particularly
controversial about that behavior, but the developers have another
objective in mind: they want to be able to change the PIDs of contained
processes without the processes themselves noticing.  In particular, they
would like to be able to migrate a container to a different system, which
will certainly assign new PIDs to every process within the container.  Code
written for Unix-like systems does not normally expect its PID to change
over time, however; so switching PIDs underneath a process could lead to all
kinds of strange behavior.  To avoid this problem, the plan is that PIDs remain
constant within the container, even if those PIDs change in the real world.
<p>

Implementing constant PIDs (from a viewpoint inside the container) is not a
straightforward task; it involves adding a whole new virtualization layer
inside the kernel.  There are two types of PIDs now, "real" PIDs and the
virtual PIDs used by contained processes.  Any place in the kernel which
deals with PID values must become aware of which type of PID it is using,
and convert to the other type when necessary.  So, as a general rule, any
code which exchanges PIDs with user space must use the virtual variety,
while PIDs handled within the kernel are real.
<p>

The PID logic is complicated by a few little details, like: what happens
when containers are nested?  A process living within a container has a real
PID and a virtual PID associated with the container.  If that process
creates a container of its own, it will acquire yet another PID associated
with the new container.  So it is not possible to simply convert a real PID
to a virtual PID; such questions require a "context" so that the kernel
knows <i>which</i> virtual PID is wanted.
<p>

The result of all this is that PID handling within the kernel changes
significantly.  Code which used to get the current process's PID with
<tt>current-&gt;pid</tt> must now use <tt>tsk_pid(current)</tt> for the
real PID, or <tt>tsk_vpid(current)</tt> for the virtual PID - and it must
know which one it wants.  In situations where more than one virtual PID
might be appropriate, <tt>tsk_vpid_ctx()</tt> must be used to supply the
context.  Much of the patch set is concerned simply with
making these conversions; for good measure, it also renames the <tt>pid</tt>
field of <tt>struct task_struct</tt> to catch any code still trying to
access it directly.
<p>

Behind all of this is a concept called "pidspaces."  The patch carves up
the global PID space takes the upper 9 bits of the 32-bit PID value and
puts the pidspace number there.  A virtual PID as seen within a container
is turned into a real kernel PID by stuffing the pidspace number in those
upper bits.  Since the contained processes only see virtual PIDs, they
never see the pidspace number, and they will not notice if that number
changes. 
<p>

All of this code seems to work, but there is a certain amount of opposition
to merging it.  As Alan Cox <a href="/Articles/168096/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is an obscure, weird piece of functionality for some special
	case usages most of which are going to be eliminated by Xen. I
	don't see the kernel side justification for it at all.
</div>
<p>
The developers answer that the ability to checkpoint and restart process
trees, possibly moving them in between, will be highly useful.  Some other
virtualization projects also require this capability - not everybody wants
to use Xen.  So the pressure for
PID virtualization probably won't just go away.
<p>
What might happen is that the hiding of <tt>current-&gt;pid</tt> might be
taken out, greatly reducing the size of the patch.  Another idea which has
been floated is to eliminate, to the greatest degree possible, the use of
PIDs within the kernel.  Almost any in-kernel use of a PID can be replaced
with a direct pointer to the task structure.  If a PID eventually is
reduced to little more than a process-identifying cookie used for
communication with user space, it will be easier to virtualize without
complicating large amounts of kernel code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Just a curious uninformed question, what does this really offer that cannot be done with UML or Xen? Aside from possible performance enhancements and such. I mean I do understand how it's different technically, but if it's so much trouble and invasive on others, what's the real benefit?

<p>
Is UML even developed any more these days? Looking at its home page,
it seems to talk about 2.4 kernels, like here:
<a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/dl-sf.html">
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/dl-sf.html</a>
<p>
Anyway, getting these isolated containers without having many copies of the
kernel is probably a big enough performance enhancement to
be worth the trouble.

      The future part of this that would seem to be useful would be the cluster aspects. <br>
<p>
Machine A detects a system fault and is going to shutdown<br>
<p>
A tells the cluster manager(s) it has these containers that need to be moved. <br>
<p>
The cluster manager finds another machine (machine C and D) and tells Machine A<br>
<p>
Machine A and C/Cdo the needed process handover and containers start running on C/D. <br>
<p>
Machine A shutsdown.<br>
<p>
[Of course this may be possible with Xen, but it would seem to be a heavier solution with the fact that C/D would then need to instantiate and start a new sub-kernel process and every other sub-process (nfs,  etc) that was in the old Xen.]<br>

      <i>what does this really offer that cannot be done with UML or Xen?</i>
<p>
I'm hardly an expert, but I'll post my understanding here so that if I'm wrong someone can point it out to me :)
<p>
Xen, as far as I know, runs a virtual machine within the kernal (okay, it's not a virtual machine in the VMware sense, but that's the concept).
<p>
A container is a collection of processes that are aware of each other.  Basically, Xen is the kernel, and the container is the processes RUNNING on the kernel.
<p>
If you have a series of long-running processes that can grow in memory/CPU usage, conventional load-balancing techniques won't help you at all.  This would let you move some of those processes to other machines.  (or perhaps to another CPU on the same machine...LWN didn't mention anything about threads).  Heck, this could give you a "suspend-to-disk" method that would let you take your work from machine to machine.  Imagine carrying a USB drive with your work container on it, and being able to load up that container on whatever linux system you're at.  (although Xen probably can/will do something similar to that, except that it'd have to carry your whole OS with it)

      If I make a few assumptions about process migration: <br>
<p>
1.  A container cannot be divided--all of its processes move, or none.<br>
<p>
2.  Moving a container is transparent--the processes have the same open files and network sockets when they arrive at their destination<br>
<p>
then there's very little difference between a VM and a migratable process container.  A plain process container isn't sufficient--you'd need to keep file descriptors, memory maps, and a bunch of other state to make migration work.  VM's have all that, but need nothing else since they can defer the rest to their host kernel.<br>
<p>
I suspect that the cost/capability curves of "light VM" and "heavy process container" will intersect each other at some point.  The nice thing about VM's is that they start off isolated from the kernel and gradually intrude into the kernel, while process containers start out intrusive and gradually become less intrusive.<br>

      It was implemented in OpenVZ half a year already.<br>
This feature is mostly important for VPS checkpointing/restoring/migration.<br>
And not everyone wants to use Virtual Machines just for having an ability to move applications across machines.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 19, 2012</br>
           </div>
One of the (many) classic essays in <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> by
Frederick Brooks is titled "Plan to throw one away."  Our first solution to
a complex software development problem, he says, is not going to be fit for
the intended
purpose.  So we will end up dumping it and starting over.  The free
software development process is, as a whole, pretty good at the "throwing
it away" task; some would argue that we're <i>too</i> good at it.  But
there are times when throwing one away is hard; the current discussion
around control groups in the kernel shows how situation can come about.
<p>
What Brooks actually said (in the original edition) was:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In most projects, the first system built is barely usable.  It may
	be too slow, too big, awkward to use, or all three.  There is no
	alternative but to start again, smarting but smarter, and build a
	redesigned version in which these problems are solved.  The discard
	and redesign may be done in one lump, or it may be done
	piece-by-piece.  But all large-system experience shows that it will
	be done.
</div>
<p>
One could argue that free software development has taken this advice to
heart.  In most projects of any significant size, proposed changes are
subjected 
to multiple rounds of review, testing, and improvement.  Often, a
significant patch set will go through enough fundamental changes that
it bears little resemblance to its initial version.  In cases like this,
the new subsystem has, in a sense, been thrown away and redesigned.
<p>
In some cases it's even more explicit.  The 2.2 kernel, initially, lacked
support for an up-and-coming new bus called USB.  Quite a bit of work had
gone into the development of a candidate USB subsystem which, most people
assumed, would be merged sometime soon.  Instead, in May 1999, Linus
looked at the code and decided to start over; the 2.2.7 kernel included a
shiny new USB subsystem that nobody had ever seen before.  That code
incorporated lessons learned from the earlier attempts and was a better
solution â€” but even that version was eventually thrown away and replaced.
<p>
Brooks talks about the need for "pilot plant" implementations to turn up
the problems in the initial implementation.  Arguably we have those in the
form of testing releases, development trees, and, perhaps most usefully,
early patches shipped by distributors.  As our ability to test for
performance regressions grows, we should be able to do much of our
throwing-away before problems in early implementations are inflicted upon
users.  For example, the 3.6 kernel was able to avoid a 20% regression in
PostgreSQL performance thanks to pre-release testing.
<p>
But there are times when the problem is so large and so poorly understood
that the only way to gain successful "pilot plant" experience is to ship
the best implementation we can come up with and hope that things can be
fixed up later.  As long as the problems are internal, this fixing can
often be done without creating trouble for users.  Indeed, the history of
most software projects (free and otherwise) can be seen as an exercise in
shipping inferior code, then reimplementing things to be slightly less
inferior and starting over again.  The Linux systems we run today, in many
ways, look like those of ten years or so ago, but a great deal of code was
replaced in the time between when those systems were shipped.
<p>
But what happens when the API design is part of the problem?  User
interfaces are hard to design and, when they turn out to be wrong, they can
be hard to fix.  It turns out that users don't like it when things change
on them; they like it even less if their programs and scripts break in
the process.  As a result, developers at all levels of the stack work hard to
avoid the creation of incompatible changes at the user-visible levels.  It
is usually better to live with one's mistakes than to push the cost of
fixing them onto the user community.
<p>
Sometimes, though, those mistakes are an impediment to the creation of a
proper solution.  As an example, consider the control groups (cgroups) mechanism
within the kernel.  Control groups were first added to the 2.6.24 kernel
(January, 2008) as a piece of
the solution to the "containers" problem; indeed, they were initially
called "process containers."  They have since become one of the most deeply
maligned parts of the kernel, to the point that some developers routinely
threaten to rip them out when nobody is looking.  But the functionality
provided by control groups is useful and increasingly necessary, so it's
not surprising that developers are trying to identify and fix the problems
that have been exposed in the current ("pilot") control group
implementation.
<p>
As can be seen in <a href="/Articles/516954/">this cgroup TODO list</a>
posted by Tejun Heo, lot of those problems are internal in nature.  Fixing
them will require a lot of changes to kernel code, but users should not
notice that anything has changed at all.  But there are some issues that
cannot be hidden from users. In particular: (1)&nbsp;the cgroup design
allows for multiple hierarchies, with different controllers (modules that
apply policies to groups) working with possibly different views of the
process tree, and (2)&nbsp;the implementation of process hierarchies is
inconsistent from one controller to the next.  
<p>
Multiple hierarchies seemed like an interesting feature at the outset; why
should the CPU usage controller be forced to work with the same view of the
process tree as, say, the memory usage controller?  But the result is a
more complicated implementation that makes it nearly impossible for
controllers to coordinate with each other.  The block I/O bandwidth
controller and the memory usage controller really need to share a view of
which control group "owns" each page in the system, but that cannot be done
if those two controllers are working with separate trees of control
groups.  The hierarchy implementation issues also make coordination
difficult while greatly complicating the lives of system administrators
who need to try to figure out what behavior is actually implemented by each
controller.  It is a mess that leads to inefficient implementations and
administrative hassles.
<p>
How does one fix a problem like this?  The obvious answer is to force the
use of a single control group hierarchy and to fix the controllers to
implement their policies over hierarchies in a consistent manner.  But both
of those are significant, user-visible API and behavioral changes.  And,
once again, a user whose system has just broken tends to be less than
appreciative of how much better the implementation is.
<p>
In the past, operating system vendors have often had to face issues like
this.  They have responded by saving up all the big changes for a major
system update; users learned to expect things to break over such updates.
Perhaps the definitive example was the transition from "Solaris&nbsp;1"
(usually known as SunOS&nbsp;4 in those days) to Solaris&nbsp;2, which switched
the entire system from a BSD-derived base to one from ATT Unix.  Needless
to say, lots of things broke in the process.  In the
Linux world, this kind of transition still happens with enterprise
distributions; RHEL7 will have a great many incompatible changes from
RHEL6.  But community distributions tend not to work that way.
<p>
More to the point, the components that make up a distribution are typically
not managed that way.  Nobody in the kernel community wants to go back to
the pre-2.6 days when major features only got to users after a multi-year
delay.  So, if problems like those described above are going to be fixed in
the kernel, the kernel developers will have to figure out a way to do it in
the regular, approximately 80-day development cycle.
<p>
In this case, the plan seems to be to prod users with warnings of upcoming
changes while trying to determine if anybody really has difficulties with
them.  So, systems where multiple cgroup hierarchies are in use will emit
warnings to the effect that the feature is deprecated and inviting email
from anybody who objects.  Similar warnings will be put into specific
controllers whose behavior is expected to change.  Consider the memory
controller; as Tejun put it: "<q>memcg asked itself the existential
question of to be hierarchical or not and then got confused and decided to
become both</q>".  The plan is to get distributors to carry <a
href="/Articles/516956/">a patch</a> warning users of the non-hierarchical
mode and asking them to make their needs known if the change will truly be
a problem for them.  In a sense, the distributors are being asked to run a
pilot for the new cgroup API.
<p>
It is possible that the community got lucky this time around; the features
that need to be removed or changed are not likely to be heavily used.  In
other cases, there is simply no alternative to retaining the older,
mistaken design; the <tt>telldir()</tt> system call, which imposes heavy
implementation costs on filesystems, is a good example.  We can never
preserve our ability to "throw one away" in all situations.  But, as a
whole, the free software community has managed to incorporate Brooks's
advice nicely.  We throw away huge quantities of code all the time, and we
are better off for it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I keep hearing how bad telldir is, but that doesn't make it true.<br>
<p>
You really need something like it to implement NFS - or any network filesystem.<br>
<p>
And really, it isn't that hard to design a good directory structure which provides stable telldir addresses.  Unfortunately it is easier to design one that doesn't.<br>
<p>
(I agree that it is difficult to design a good directory structure which is format-compatible with ext2 and which provides stable telldir cookies, but that isn't really telldir's fault).<br>
<p>
(which doesn't answer your suggestion about user-space emulation except to observe that it wouldn't help for NFS).<br>

      <p>Because NFS is completely stateless protocol. This means that server should handle telldir correctly even if it crashed and was restarted, for example.</p>

<p>This is circular logic: you need telldir(2) to implement telldir(2) and this can not be done entirely in userspace. Duh. Of course. But why NFS is designed this way in a first place?</p>

      <h4><font color=yellow>> You never had your $HOME hosted on a original NFS server, did you ?</font></h4>

I remember the move from SunOS/3.2.x to SunOS/4.x, and the problems implementing their automounter. $HOME was <i>always</i> NFS-mounted from a remote server, as were /usr/local hierarchies with $ARCH-specific binaries, libraries, and config files.</p>

<h4><font color=yellow>> Perhaps the definitive example was the transition from "Solaris 1" (usually known as SunOS 4 in those days) to Solaris 2, which switched the entire system from a BSD-derived base to one from ATT Unix.</font></h4>

Prior to that, SMCC's move from the Motorola 68000 to their own SPARC was an even more difficult -- if not devastating -- move, one which paved the way for the subsequent SunOS->Solaris2 betrayal.</p>

It's much more fundamental than that. To implement the READDIR request, or anything like it in a stateless protocol (ignoring here hypothetical protocols which can only return the whole directory in one go, since they would have obviously terrible performance), you must be able to ask for 'the next bit of the directory from where I was readdir()ing last' even though the server has no idea where you might be in the directory because the protocol is stateless. NFS does this by handing you a cookie with each READDIR response which corresponds in some way the spec does not specify to the location of that file in a readdir() response, so you can pass it back in the next request and get the next filename.<br>
<p>
And that cookie is, of course, an (encoded) return value of telldir().<br>
<p>
Worse yet, because NFS is stateless, *any* nonpersistent telldir() cookies are going to fail with NFS: the pathological case of someone who does a telldir() and then a seekdir() much much later in a different call to opendir() is downright *common* if you've got an NFS server looking at that filesystem.<br>
<p>
Which means that every NFS-exportable fs (any serious FS, period) needs a way to encode positions in all directories, stably, into a 32-bit number, with vaguely reasonable things happening to those positions even when the directories change. It's a complete pig on a lot of filesystems: they sometimes need whole extra data structures just to make this one system call work. But, as Neil says, something like it does indeed seem to be essential if you want stateless network filesystems of any sort to work. I wish there was a better way, but I wish for a lot of impossible things.<br>

<p>I'm not so sure. You'll only have "an obviously terrible performance" if you have thousands (or maybe millions?) of files in one directory. When NFS was initially developed you had horrible performance in such a case no matter what (typically you had O(NÂ²) performance and thousands of files were not acceptable for that reason alone) and later versions are not completely stateless so in the end the whole exercise only created grief for a lot of people without any actual upside.</p>

<p>But it's obviously to late to try to fix it.</p>

While this can certainly work "fine", it still imposes on the filesystem.  It requires that the file system stores a lexically-order index of each directory.  So you would have to design (part of) your filesystem to match this interface.<br>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that, except that we already have a much more broadly used interface which you can design you filesystem to.<br>
<p>
There was at one stage a proposal before the NFSv4 working group to allow the lookup key for directories to be either an opaque fixed-sized blob, or a directory entry name.  The filesystem would somehow indicate what it wanted (Came from Hans Reiser if I remember correctly).  Unfortunately it never went anywhere.<br>

I'm not sure why you need a lexically-ordered index if you use filenames as the location token.   It would seem to me that what you need is a consistent ordering rather then a lexical one.  I'm assumming here that we are talking about a directory which is static and we just want to make sure that we see every filename at some point.<br>
<p>
BTW, are there any standards which speak to what one should see in the presence of directory changes?  Personally, the most I would hope for in the dynamic directory case is that a program would eventually see every file that existed at opendir() time before readdir() returned no more files.<br>

Agreed... but given that you need an ordering to allow you to locate where a missing arbitrary string needs to go, it must rely on an ordering property present in any arbitrary string.  Which leaves you with little other than a lexical ordering.<br>

Yes - ordering doesn't need to be strictly lexical, does need to be stable.<br>
<p>
Why would you have an ordering that isn't stable?  The obvious answer is that a hash table with chaining is commonly used and does not reliably provide a stable order (as collisions tend to be ordered based on creation order).<br>
<p>
My preferred mechanism for directory indexing is a hash table with internal chaining.  It easily provides a reliable fixed size telldir cookie, and performance should be quite good until the number of directory entries gets to about half the cookie space.<br>

I don't know. POSIX says that readdir() returns "an ordered sequence of all the directory entries in a particular directory", which surely implies that if a file is removed during readdir() you cannot skip other files -- but it never says, nor by my reading implies that you cannot repeat some of them in this situation. This means that if you're occasionally forced to restart a directory because you can't figure out where the requester was, so be it -- though it is probably best if that require multiple things to go wrong.<br>
<p>
(e.g. in the scheme I sketched above, if a readdir requester's random-cookie/filename-&gt;DIR* entry was expired by the server and the name the readdir requester passed was missing from the directory, readdir would simply start passing back filenames from the start of the directory over again. This does mean that under extreme load, so the cookies kept expiring, and seriously extreme modification rates of a sufficiently huge directory, so that at least one name was deleted while being readdir()ed and while its cookie expired on every pass through the directory, readdir() might never come to an end -- but that's possible under extreme modification rates anyway, even on local filesystems, and this is a pathological case that's unlikely to occur in practice. To be honest, given that bugs in which filenames were persistently omitted if they were in the wrong place in the directory persisted in the BSDs for something like thirty years, it seems that programs' actual requirements of readdir() are rather less extreme than the guarantees!)<br>

rename()s during readdir() can cause the renamed files to be returned twice or never. I'm not entirely sure if other non-renamed files can be returned twice. Deleting files (or at least rename()ing to another directory) can cause some files to be skipped with some filesystems (unfortunately I didn't keep more details).

Ooh, according to that lkml thread, it *is* possible to get a consistent state of a directory, on linux. You just need to allocate a buffer big enough for the whole directory to fit in.

what happens if the filesystem doesn't store the files in a nice simple list, but instead stores them in some sort of tree format, and the tree can be re-ordered significantly between one call and the next.<br>
<p>
For simple filesystems you get simple answers. for complex filesystems things get really messy.<br>

      <blockquote>NFS is completely stateless protocol.</blockquote>

<p>NFSv4 isn't stateless, and in practice though NFSv3 itself may have been stateful, it was usually run alongside NLM.

<p>And I don't see why you couldn't in theory add a little more state to the protocol and make seekdir/telldir.  Whether that would actually be a practical solution to anyone's problem, I don't know....

I was always amused by the term "stateless" as applied to NFS, because I always thought the content of files was "state"...<br>
<p>
Obviously "state" and "stateless" are relative terms which we need to be careful with.<br>
<p>
NFSv4 certainly has a lot of state, but for much of this state (not including the files!) the server it allowed to drop the state - on a reboot.  NFSv4 has a whole sub-protocol for recovering that state which essentially involves the server saying "If forgot everything, tell me what you know" and the clients saying "I had this file locked and this one open etc etc".  I.e. the clients also store the state and feed it back to the server (Bruce of course knows all of this).<br>
<p>
Were "current directory pointer" to be part of the "state" of an open file (when that file was a directory) ... how would the client reinstate that state when the server lost it?  It would need a stable cookie!<br>
<p>
I think the NFSv4 protocol does mention the possibility of the server saving some of its state to "stable storage" - there are  times (particularly relating to extended partial network partitions) where that is needed and so the cost would be justified. (a bit like /var/lib/nfs/sm).<br>
I suspect that storing directory offsets (after every readdir call!) to stable storage would be less than ideal for performance.<br>

Yeah, so I had only the two obvious ideas:<br>
<p>
1. Directory-modifying operations could be blocked during the grace period, during which clients could reclaim their previous cursors.  (Is that enough to help?)<br>
<p>
2. The existence of a directory-open might make it practical to keep readdir cursors in stable storage (since now you have to remember a limited amount of state for open directories, as opposed to remembering every cookie you've ever handed out.)<br>
<p>
I dunno.<br>

Your first option brings back horrible memories of servers locking solid blocking on downed NFS servers. Anything that blocks fs operations is dancing with the deadlock fairy. (I'd say that if someone modifies a directory on which a cookie is held, that cookie is invalidated. It's not like there are meaningful guarantees for readdir() on directories under modification even in the local case.)<br>
<p>
I don't see why the client doesn't just remember 'the last filename we readdir()ed' and hand that back, probably in addition with a crude, random, non-stable cookie generated by the server in *its* last response in the same opendir() loop. I suppose it would make the readdir request a bit bigger... but in the common case of readdir()s following each other in quick succession it need be no slower: the server could keep a bit of extremely temporary local-only state (basically a readdir() handle and the random cookie we sent back with the last response) for recently received readdir() requests, compare the incoming request with the random cookie and filename, and now we know the next name to use, expiring the pair when we hit the end of the directory. If we expire the cookie/filename pair (which should be rare enough), we just need to opendir() the directory and readdir() through it until we find the filename again.<br>
<p>
What am I missing? (Other than the fact that we can't change NFS because it's already there and doesn't work this way.)<br>

I was thinking mostly of 'core' NFSv3. NLM/lockd was always a bolt-on: suggesting that a stateful subsystem be used for something like readdir would never have flown. (A bit silly, really, because readdir(), locally, is about as stateful as anything can get.)<br>

"RHEL7 will have a great many incompatible changes from RHEL6"<br>
<p>
Except for the time when thread implementation change I don't much incompatibilities between RHEL version. At our work place we have a bunch of programs compiler on RHEL3 that still run on newer versions if the proper compatbility lib is provided, most of the time older version of shared libs.<br>

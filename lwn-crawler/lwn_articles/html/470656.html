<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 6, 2011</br>
           </div>
Control groups are used for a number of purposes, but the most important
role for many is the application of resource limits to groups of
processes.  The memory usage controller has seen a lot of development
effort in recent years, but it still has a number of shortcomings, one of
which being that it only applies to user-space memory.  Some workloads can
cause the use of large amounts of memory in the kernel, leading to overall
system memory pressure, but the memory controller is unable to place limits
on that memory usage.  A first step toward fixing that problem may yet
find its way into the 3.3 kernel, but it shows how hard the job can be.
<p>
Glauber Costa's <a href="/Articles/470689/">per-cgroup TCP memory pressure
controls patch</a> starts by adding a bit of infrastructure to the memory
controller for the tracking of kernel-space memory use.  A pair of new
knobs is added: <tt>memory.kmem.limit_in_bytes</tt> controls how much
kernel memory a control group is allowed to use, while
<tt>memory.independent_kmem_limit</tt> is a boolean controlling whether the
kernel limits are to be managed separately from the user-space limits.  If
that boolean is false, kernel memory usage is simply added to user-space
memory usage and the kernel memory limit is ignored.  There is also a new
<tt>memory.kmem.usage_in_bytes</tt> value that can be read to see what the
current memory usage is.
<p>
This infrastructure is nice, but there is one other little difficulty:
there are thousands of places in the kernel where memory is allocated and
none of them are instrumented in a way that allows those allocations to be
charged to a specific control group.  An implementation of that accounting
on a kernel-wide basis
may never happen; it certainly will not happen at the outset.  So
developers seeking to add this functionality need to focus on specific data
structures.  Some past work has been done to apply limits to the dentry
cache, but Glauber chose a different limit: buffers used in the
implementation of the TCP network protocol.
<p>
Those buffers hold packet data as it passes through a socket; in some
situations they can become quite large, so they are a logical place to try
to apply limits.  What is even better is that the networking stack already
has logic to place limits on buffer sizes when memory is tight.  In current
kernels, if the system as a whole is seen to be under memory pressure, the
networking code will do its best to help.  Its responses can include
decisions not to increase the size of TCP windows, to drop packets, or to
refuse to expand buffers for outgoing data. 
<p>
Given that this infrastructure was in place, all that Glauber needed to do
was to enhance the stack's idea of what constitutes "memory pressure."
That means instrumenting the places that allocate and free buffer memory to
charge those allocations to the owning control group.  Then, "memory
pressure" becomes a combination of the previous global value and the
current control group's status with regard to its kernel memory limit.  If
that limit has been exceeded, the stack will behave (with regard to that
control group's sockets) as if the system as a
whole were under memory pressure, even if the global state is fine.
<p>
The first patches did exactly that and seemed to be on their way toward
inclusion in the 3.2 merge window.  It ran into a bit of a snag when the
core networking developers took a look at it, though.  Networking
maintainer David Miller <a href="/Articles/470660/">rejected the patch</a>
out of hand, complaining about the overhead it adds to the networking fast
paths even in cases where the feature is not in use.  He <a
href="/Articles/470661/">added</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	People keep asking every few releases "where the heck has my
	performance gone" and it's because of creeping features like this.
	This socket cgroup feature is a prime example of where that kind of
	stuff comes from.
<p>
	I really get irritated when people go "oh, it's just one indirect
	function call" and "oh, it's just one more pointer in struct sock"
	We work really hard to _remove_ elements from structures and make
	them smaller, and to remove expensive operations from the fast
	paths.
</div>
<p>
There are a lot of important memory-allocation sites in the kernel that can
be found in relatively hot execution paths; the networking developers may
obsess about adding overhead to those paths, but they are certainly not
alone in that concern.  So a solution had to be found that did not impose
that overhead on systems where the feature is not in use.
<p>
The words "in use" are important here as well.  If kernel memory usage
limits are useful, distributors will want to enable them in the kernels
they ship.  But it may still be that most users will not actually make use
of that feature.  So it is not sufficient to remove its overhead only in
cases where it has been configured out of the kernel.  A feature like this
really needs to avoid imposing costs when it is not in use, even when it is
configured into the running kernel.
<p>
Glauber had to make some significant changes to the patch set to meet these
requirements.  TCP buffer limits are now managed separately from kernel
limits as a whole; there is a new knob (<tt>kmem.tcp.limit_in_bytes</tt>)
to control that limit.  All of the fast-path code is now contained within a
<a href="/Articles/436041/">static branch</a>, meaning that, when the code
is not enabled, it can be skipped over with almost no overhead at all.
That static branch is only turned on when a TCP buffer limit is established
for a non-root control group.  So, as required, it should not have
significant effects in kernels where the feature is configured in but not
being used.
<p>
As of this writing, no decision to merge these patches for 3.3 has been
announced, but the number of criticisms has been steadily dropping.  So it
may well get into the mainline in the next merge window.  But Glauber's
experience shows how hard it will be to add more kernel memory accounting;
the requirement that its impact be imperceptible will lead to more work and
trickier code.  For that reason alone, accounting for all kernel memory use
seems unlikely to ever happen.  Developers will focus on the few cases
where the application of limits can bring about significant changes in
behavior and not worry about the rest.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

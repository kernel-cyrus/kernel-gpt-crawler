           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 10, 2017</br>
           </div>
A hash function performs a one-way computation on a set of data, producing
a set of bytes that, one hopes, is effectively random and which cannot be
used to derive the input data.  The kernel uses hash functions in numerous
places for everything from the generation of security-sensitive sequence
numbers to the implementation of hash tables.  The security of those
functions is increasingly in doubt, and, seemingly, their performance can
be improved as well.  The process of replacing these hash functions will
begin with the 4.11 kernel, which should see the introduction of the <a
href="https://131002.net/siphash/">SipHash</a> pseudo-random function.
<p>
SipHash is the creation of Jean-Philippe Aumasson and (<a
href="/Articles/681615/">inevitably</a>) Daniel J. Bernstein; readers
interested in the details can find them in <a
href="https://131002.net/siphash/siphash.pdf">this paper [PDF]</a>.  It was
designed with a number of objectives in mind, starting with being a
cryptographically secure hash function.  In practice, what that means is
that it is computationally infeasible to derive the input data from its
corresponding hash, or to derive the secret data used in the hashing
operation even 
given the ability to see the output for a set of chosen inputs.  Another
important objective was speed, especially with smaller inputs.  Many
existing hash functions have a high setup overhead; that cost matters
little when large amounts of data are being hashed, but it hurts for the
hashing of smaller inputs.  As it happens, many of the hashing operations
in the kernel are applied to small chunks of data, so lower overhead would be
welcome.
<p>
The list of SipHash users is large and growing; many projects have adopted
it in an attempt to defend against <a
href="/Articles/474912/">hash-collision attacks</a>.  These attacks 
exploit a known hash function to cause a hash table to degrade into a
simple linear list, with potentially devastating effects on performance.
The Python language <a href="/Articles/574761/">switched to SipHash</a> in
2013; other users include various BSD distributions, Perl, Ruby, Rust, and
more.  This move is <a href="http://perl11.org/blog/seed.html">not
universally acclaimed</a>, but most seem to see it as a step in the right
direction.  Thus far, however, the kernel has lacked a SipHash implementation.
<p>
What does the kernel use instead?  As might be expected with a large body
of code like the kernel, different algorithms are employed in different
settings.  The generation of TCP sequence numbers, for example, is done
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> hash
function, which 
has been regarded as insecure for some time.  That is potentially
problematic, since an attacker who can predict sequence numbers can
interfere with or inject data into network connections.  The
<tt>get_random_int()</tt> and <tt>get_random_long()</tt> functions used
extensively throughout the kernel are also based on MD5.

The "syncookies" that can be employed to defend against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood</a> attacks are,
instead, generated with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-0">SHA-1</a> which, while more
secure than MD5, is showing its age as well.  SHA-1 is also used in the core
random-number generator, in the BPF subsystem, and elsewhere.
<p>
Use of those algorithms, however, pales next to the usage of a function
called <tt>jhash()</tt> (and its variants), a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function">Jenkins hash</a>
implementation. 
The kernel contains a lot of hash tables, and, as a general rule,
<tt>jhash()</tt> is the hash function used to place data into hash
buckets.  This function has the advantage of being quite fast, but it makes
no claims to cryptographic security.  Many in-kernel users include some
secret data of their own as a defense against collision attacks.  But if
the results of the hash are visible to a hacker (and simply listing the
contents of the table in order may suffice), then deriving that secret data
is a relatively easy task.
<p>
Jason Donenfeld set out to replace all of these hashing functions with <a
href="/Articles/710962/">an implementation of SipHash</a> inside the
kernel. SipHash uses an explicit secret key for collision defense, so the
first order of business for an in-kernel user is the generation of that
key:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/siphash.h&gt;

    siphash_key_t hash_secret;
    get_random_bytes(&amp;hash_secret, sizeof(hash_secret));
</pre>
<p>

The use of <tt>get_random_bytes()</tt> is, according to the documentation,
the only proper way to initialize this secret.  Thereafter, of course,
kernel code should take care not to expose the secret outside of the kernel
itself, or the protection against hash collisions will be lost.
<p>
The hashing of data is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    u64 siphash(const void *data, size_t len, const siphash_key_t *key);
</pre>
<p>
The return value will be a 64-bit hash of the input <tt>data</tt>.  There
are a number of optimized variants for constant-size input data, but most
developers need not worry about those since the generic version will pick
one of those at compile time if appropriate.
<p>
SipHash is significantly faster than either MD5 or SHA-1, while producing
results that are deemed to be more secure.  So the replacement of the older
algorithms with SipHash should not be a difficult decision to make.  The
same is not true for <tt>jhash()</tt>, which is much faster than SipHash.
In an attempt to convince <tt>jhash()</tt> users to make the switch,
Donenfeld added a "HalfSipHash" variant:
<p>
<pre>
    u32 hsiphash(const void *data, size_t len, const hsiphash_key_t *key);
</pre>
<p>
This version uses a reduced variant of the SipHash algorithm to produce a
smaller and less secure result.  Users of <tt>jhash()</tt> who do not want
to pay the cost of SipHash might just be convinced to use this version
instead, an outcome described by Donenfeld as "<q>a terrifying but
potentially useful possibility</q>".  Potential users will note that,
while <tt>hsiphash()</tt> is faster than <tt>siphash()</tt>, it still takes
about three times as long as <tt>jhash()</tt> to produce a result.  The
better security that comes from using it should justify the cost in many
settings, but it also seems likely that <tt>jhash()</tt> won't be going
away anytime soon.
<p>
The patch set has been through a few revisions, with some relatively small
changes being made.  The biggest complaint about it seems to have <a
href="/Articles/711205/">come from networking maintainer David Miller</a>,
who was not entirely happy about moving away from hash functions that are
implemented by the CPUs themselves:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This and the next patch are a real shame, performance wise, on cpus
	that have single-instruction SHA1 and MD5 implementations.  Sparc64
	has both, and I believe x86_64 can do SHA1 these days.
	It took so long to get those instructions into real silicon, and then
	have software implemented to make use of them as well.
</div>
<p>
The interesting thing, as a couple of participants pointed out, is that
Linux is not actually using these hashing instructions even on the hardware
that supports them.  Among other things, they require some setup cost that
takes away a lot of the performance benefit, especially for small input
data arrays.  So the existence of hardware-based implementations is, for
now, not relevant.
<p>
In any case, Miller <a href="/Articles/711206/">applied the
patches</a> on January&nbsp;9, so they should make it into the mainline
during the 4.11 merge 
window.  The process of converting at least some of those <tt>jhash()</tt>
users has not 
yet begun, though, and can be expected to take some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That's true, but each new paper about it shaves off a couple of bits from the part of the space you have to brute force, and the rate the papers get published seems to be accelerating.  So from that we can begin estimating when pre-image attacks will become available, and the conclusion is not pleasing if you're using SHA-1.<br>
<p>
Though if we all act on that now, maybe that will reduce the interest enough to slow the research down ;)<br>

      For hash tables one can combine performance in the non-attack case with performance in the under-attack case: Use a fast hash function by default, monitor the collisions, and if collisions rise significantly beyond the statistically expected number, switch to a cryptographically secure hash function.

Except the existing implementations already do exactly that.<br>
<p>
I got involved in a discussion about hashing, for some reason, and the kernel algorithms go as far as completely rebuilding the hash list if they think an attack is under way.<br>
<p>
It's not that expensive in the grand scheme of things. Either the hash list is small, or it's badly degraded. So either the cost IS minimal, or it's RELATIVELY minimal.<br>

Tell the search algorithm to search both tables.<br>
Add all new entries to the new table.<br>
Use something like RCU to copy entries from the old table to the new.<br>
<p>
So performance is still degraded for a little bit as the old table still has to be searched, but it improves rapidly as normal processing will remove a load of entries from the degraded hash, and RCU will remove the rest. Or even it doesn't bother cleaning up the old hash straight away, as it expects normal operation to reap a lot of entries pretty quickly.<br>

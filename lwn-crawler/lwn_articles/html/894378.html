</div>
The <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM) was the
first chance for Linux memory-management developers to gather in three
years.  In a session at the end of the first day led by maintainer Andrew
Morton, those developers discussed the memory-management development
process.  While the overall governance will remain the same, there are
nonetheless some significant changes in store for this subsystem.
<p>
Morton started by saying that he was finally moving part of his process to
Git â€” a change he has resisted for many years.  There will be three trees
kept on kernel.org for patches currently in development.  The "hot fixes"
tree is just what it sounds like; it will have branches for various
releases with important fixes to upstream code.  The "stable" tree holds
material destined for the mainline, probably in the next merge window,
while the "unstable" queue holds less mature material.
<p>
All three of these trees will be routinely rolled together to make the
<tt>-mm</tt> tree and fed into
linux-next.  Morton made it clear that he will still use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt_(software)">Quilt</a> as much as 
he can for his own workflow; he finds it to be much more flexible when work is still in flux.
He did say, though, that he will be willing to do Git pulls from developers
"if I have to", but he still doesn't think that model works.  There has

<a href="/Articles/894386/"><img

title="Andrew Morton" class="rthumb"></a>

never been a significant patch set, he said, that has gotten through the
memory-management tree unscathed, so Git's immutable model is a poor fit.
His management policy will be, he said,
to "stabilize forever" until patches seem ready for the stable tree, at
which point they will be merged into a branch while waiting to go upstream.
<p>
The unstable tree exists <i>only</i> as a Quilt queue for now, though it
will eventually be available in Git as well.  When that happens, probably
in the 5.19 cycle, he does not want developers to use the result as a base
for development.  Instead, all patches should be against an upstream
release, preferably the previous <tt>-rc3</tt>.  Each series will be stored
in a separate branch, even if there is 
only one patch involved.  The result will obviously be many branches with
long names; they will start with <tt>mm-unstable-</tt> and contain the
patch subject.  When developers send follow-on patches, he said, they
should include the target branch name.
<p>
The stable tree is meant to be immutable, meaning it will never
be rebased.  That is a nice idea, he said, but it only works if there is
material to put into it.  He has been looking for this material, but
nothing is ready at this point; everything is waiting for reviews and/or
updates.  If this process is going to work developers need to
nail things down more quickly.  He plans to become more active in nagging
developers, often in private, to help push things forward.
<p>
<h4>Stability and review</h4>
<p>
Michal Hocko said that it seemed like a lot of patches are entering the <tt>-mm</tt>
tree too soon; that causes developers' attention to move on to the next
shiny thing.  Morton answered that he has begun skipping the first version
of a new patch series, partly for that reason.  But, he added, anybody who
thinks that a merge into <tt>-mm</tt> means that their work is done is
showing a lack of experience.  He tries to guide such folks when he can.
<p>
David Hildenbrand suggested that Morton should push for more review of
patches before accepting them into <tt>-mm</tt>;  a lot of
patches that break things are getting through.  In general, the community seems
to have far more ability to generate code than to review it, he said.
Morton answered that he doesn't want to block patches from <tt>-mm</tt> due
to a lack of review; he would rather get the work out there and tested.  He
will not let work proceed to the mainline, though, without proper review.
<p>
Dan Williams suggested that perhaps more transparency would help; if
developers could see the state of the queue and which patches are waiting
on review, they might feel motivated to help with that.  Morton answered that
this information is available now.  But, he said, he does make the decision
to move patches into the stable tree by himself, and he would like to
change that.  This decision, he said, should be made more transparently and
sooner.  For now, his plan is to publicly post his plans and see if there
are objections; he does not intend to wait for explicit acks before moving
work to stable, though.
<p>
He would like to see more focus on the transition to stable, which he
described as "a big deal".  Patches do not need to be perfect to be
promoted; after all, there are generally still a few months (the remainder
of the development cycle and the next full cycle after a patch is merged)
to get things up to production quality.  So his criteria are whether Linux
wants the patch overall, and whether it is in good enough condition to
proceed.
<p>
Morton raised some doubts as to whether he should be publishing the stable
tree at all.  He does not want developers to base their patches on it, but
that will surely be a temptation if it's out there.
<p>
There were some questions about documenting the process (and especially the
criteria) for moving patches into the stable tree, but Mel Gorman advised
against that.  If a set of rules is posted, developers will inevitably try
to game them.  He also said that running the stable tree in a non-rebasing
mode wasn't particularly important.  Memory-management patches tend not to
conflict often, so rebasing is unlikely to create problems for developers,
especially early in the development cycle.
<p>
Changing subject, Morton said that he actually plans to create a fourth Git
tree that will contain kernel-wide patches.  It will always be generated
from a Quilt queue, and he doesn't want to have any memory-management
material there.  Morton still handles a lot of patches to unrelated
subsystems, so the reasoning behind this tree is easy to understand.
<p>
<h4>Submaintainers</h4>
<p>
Hocko brought up the question of submaintainers in the memory-management
subsystem.  There are a few areas that are handled by another developer's
Git tree and are often pushed directly into the mainline, which he doesn't
like.  It ends up balkanizing the memory-management subsystem, he said, and
makes it hard to get a coherent picture of where things stand.  Having
submaintainers may make sense, he said, but their trees should be pulled
into <tt>-mm</tt>.  Morton said that might work; he would probably pull
those trees into the unstable branch.
<p>
Vlastimil Babka asked whether his tree, which contains changes to the slab
allocators, should be going through <tt>-mm</tt>.  Morton replied that
the current process is working and Babka should keep sending pull requests
directly to Linus Torvalds.  He would not add any value to the process, he
said.  He pointed out, though, that slab patches tend to be independent of
everything else; trying to decouple core memory-management changes,
instead, would be a nightmare.
<p>
Hocko noted, though, that conflicts between areas are rare, even in the
core memory-management subsystem.  Perhaps it would be worthwhile to bring
in more submaintainers to take on specific areas.  Morton expressed a
willingness to try and see if it works better than the current process, but
he said he would like to get the current changes stabilized first.
Hildenbrand added that new developers often don't know where to send
memory-management patches, and the <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> script
doesn't normally help.  Defining submaintainers might help in this regard;
he volunteered to take on that role for memory hotplug.
<p>
At this point, the day was approaching its end and the participants were
getting tired.  There was a bit of residual conversation on some details,
but the session came quickly to a close.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

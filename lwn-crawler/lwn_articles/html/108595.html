<h1>Crash dumps with kexec</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 27, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
One of the longstanding wishlist items for the Linux kernel is a built-in
crash dump capability.  Companies providing support for Linux, such as
vendors of "enterprise" distributions, want this capability for the help it
can provide in tracking down those obnoxious problems which only happen at
the customer's site.  Numerous implementations exist, but none have made it
into the mainline kernel.  Among the reasons for this is a lack of comfort
with the crash dump code itself.  That code runs when the state of the
system is known to be compromised; people tend to worry that the kernel, in
that state, could do unpleasant things, like corrupting filesystems.  Even
code which takes pains to never touch a disk is not entirely to be trusted
when the system is reeling from a panic.
<p>

The -mm tree contains an approach to crash dumps which may inspire a bit
more trust.  The core idea is to get the failing kernel out of the way
entirely, as soon as possible, and to boot into a new kernel which can
handle the real crash dump tasks.
<p>

The mechanism used is the <a href="/Articles/15468/">kexec</a> system call,
which loads and boots directly into a new kernel.  The original goal was
simply to speed up reboots by avoiding the BIOS and the whole set of
time-consuming boot-time rituals which it performs; it's the sort of
feature which appeals to kernel developers.  Kexec patches have been
circulating for some time, though the call has yet to make its way into a
mainline kernel.  
<p>

Using kexec to perform crash dumps requires some additional work and
advance planning.  A separate kernel must be built to run when the crash
dump capability is desired.  This kernel needs to be as small as possible,
and it must be specially configured to load into a portion of memory not
used by the primary kernel.  This kernel is also set up so that it only
uses a small piece of the total system memory; it must be able to boot and
run without changing the primary kernel's memory.
<p>

When the system is running, kexec is used to preload the crash dump kernel
into its reserved portion of memory.  If all goes well, it simply sits
there, wasting memory, and never gets run.  That overhead is simply the
price one pays for running an enterprise-class kernel.
<p>

Should the system panic, however, the crash dump kernel has its day.  The
primary kernel, once it decides that something has gone drastically wrong,
must first make a copy of the very bottom part of memory (it will get
stepped on in the booting process).  Once that is done, kexec is invoked to
boot directly into the crash dump kernel.  That kernel starts up, aware of
all memory in the system, but only using the small portion which was
reserved to it before.  The result is a full, running Linux system with
complete access to the memory state of the failed kernel.
<p>

To help with debugging of kernel crashes, the crash dump kernel provides a
couple of mechanisms for inspecting the failed kernel's memory.  The file
<tt>/proc/vmcore</tt> provides the old kernel's memory as an ELF-format
core dump; it can be looked at with <tt>gdb</tt> or another debugging
tool.  If need be, a char device (<tt>/dev/oldmem</tt>) can also be set up;
it provides raw access to the old kernel's memory.

<p>
A developer might choose to work with the crash dump kernel and try to
track down the problem immediately.  In most deployed situations, instead,
the crash dump kernel may be configured to simply copy the old kernel's
memory image to a disk file somewhere, then reboot back into the primary
system.  The crash dump file can then be examined at leisure, perhaps by
remote support staff.

<p>
The end result of all this work should be a mechanism which can be used to
track down the cause of infrequent crashes at remote sites.  That should be
good for the stability of the kernel as a whole - and the bottom line of
enterprise support companies.  See <a
href="/Articles/108596/">Documentation/kdump.txt</a> from the patch for

      I'd never thought much about this issue before reading this article, but<br>
a thought occured when I did: rather than trying to save a crash dump<br>
to a disk file, why not send it over a network to a crash dump server<br>
on another (i.e., not currently not crashing!) machine?<br>
<p>
Thus the local disks need not be touched - one would need to have a<br>
working network stack though (doesn't the console logging over-the-network<br>
stuff have some useful stuff for this purpose?).<br>
<p>
The result might be small/safe enough to be in the main kernel, and hence<br>
not require all that crash-kernel memory!<br>
<p>
Just a thought!<br>

      Fedora Core 2 includes network crash dumping and a network console.  See /etc/sysconfig/netdump and "service netdump".<br>

      Crash dump to net is a good idea - much safer than writing with what might be corrupt software onto what might be a failing disk with valuable and retrievable data on it. Absolute worst it could do is a DoS on your network, and a faulty network card can do that anyway. <br>
<p>
You don't need a full IP network stack to dump over the network. You need just enough to accomplish reliable 2-way communication with a crash dump receiver across a LAN  - a "packet driver" for the network hardware plus a minimal protocol for handshaking with the receiver.<br>
<p>
This wouldn't be much baggage to carry with a crash-dump kernel, though it would have to be configured for a particular network card (by the normal kernel at normal kernel boot time? )<br>
<p>
BTW - I'm currently trying to work out what is wrong with a system that wedges hard at rare intervals, with an MTBF of about a fortnight. Crash dump would help only if there was a way to get a crash dump out of a system that appears to be responsive only to the reset switch (though maybe it's still doing something with keyboard interrupts, no way I can tell). Yes, it's probably a hardware fault (the same kernel doesn't do this on other very similar systems) - but a dump might point at what hardware. Nothing else does.<br>

      I don't think crach dump to net is much better than any other kind: a corrupt kernel can still corrupt your data.<br>
<p>
You might try a watchdog timer (even a card) to help with your system problem. There are various drivers for them. And I guess a kernel dump could well help afterwards.<br>

I strongly disagree.  If the crashdump code doesn't even TRY to access your disk drives, it's not very likely to corrupt the filesystems thereon.  Of course, the crash that lead to the invocation of the crashdump might already have done that, but you can't blame that on the crashdump code.

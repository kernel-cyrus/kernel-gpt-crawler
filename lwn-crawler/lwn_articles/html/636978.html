<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">LSFMM 2015</a>
</div>
<p>
There have been requests from certain disk drive manufacturers for the kernel to
support  
32KB block (or sector) sizes, James Bottomley said to kick off the
discussion at a 
combined storage and filesystem session at the 2015
LSFMM Summit.  He noted that the page cache could only handle 4KB
granularity, and he didn't see that changing any time soon, which means
that 32KB block 
sizes cannot be directly supported.  But he wondered if aligning and sizing
requests for 32KB boundaries most of the time would work for the disk drives. 
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner said that XFS can already handle making requests that are
aligned and sized correctly, but Bottomley asked if that included metadata
reads and writes.  Metadata is the biggest problem, Bottomley said.
Shorter writes can be supported by doing a read-modify-write (RMW) underneath the
covers, in the filesystem, block layer, or in the disk itself.
</p>

<p>
Support for 4KB disk sectors, instead of the traditional 512-byte sectors,
was <a href="/Articles/322777/">added to Linux</a> long ago, Ric Wheeler
said.  There are disk drives with 4KB logical and physical sectors out
there now, Bottomley added.  But that change matched up with the 4KB Linux page
size.  As Ted Ts'o pointed out, the page cache will need to be able to
evict 4KB pages, which means that something will need to do an RMW
operation on disks with larger block sizes.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Chris Mason pointed out that even if all filesystems
had changes made in their data paths to do all I/O in 32KB chunks, and
those changes were ready for the 4.1 kernel (which is, of course, only a
thought experiment), it will be years before the code is in the hands of
users.  It will take at least a year before the enterprise distributions
pick up the changes and at least another year before users are comfortable
switching.  Given that the disk drive makers want support now, it would
make sense for them to add emulation of  512-byte sectors, as they did with
the 4KB drives, so no changes are required of the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Christoph Hellwig agreed, noting that virtual-memory eviction has various
corner 
cases that will require page-sized writes.  Chinner was also on board with that,
saying that the "easy solution is to fix it in the drive".   That is also
true for supporting shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives, he continued.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley asked about ext4 support for doing 32KB I/O.  Ts'o said that it
would require some work but that it could be done.  The same is true for
Btrfs, Mason said.  "We're all wrong but in slightly different ways", he
said of Linux filesystem support.  Ts'o said that there would need to be
support added to the virtual-memory subsystem to support 32KB I/O.  The
filesystems could do their own RMW to ensure the full 32KB was in the cache
when doing writes.
</p>

<p>
Chinner asked about workloads that generate lots of small files.
Bottomley said those would essentially waste an additional 28KB per file.
Each would 
require an RMW operation as well, which might not perform all that well
for some workloads.
</p>

<p>
There was a suggestion that having 4KB emulation (rather than 512-byte
emulation) would be better, but Chinner called it "immaterial".  There are
all kinds of "mapping tricks" already done by SSDs, any emulation would
essentially 
be the same.  SSD makers won't even say what the sector size is for those
devices, Bottomley said.  But Chinner said that he didn't care and didn't
really want to know.  Some were concerned about the performance
implications of hiding RMW operations in the drive, however.
</p>

<p>
One way to support larger block sizes in the page cache would be to move to
larger pages throughout the kernel.
The last time the idea of larger page sizes was raised with the memory
management (MM) folks, they were not happy with the idea, Bottomley said.  He
wondered if it was worth raising the issue on day two of the summit in a
plenary session.  But Ric Wheeler said that the topic was raised in New
Orleans (in 2013) and he didn't think the MM developers were "adamantly
opposed" to the idea, just that no one was working on it.
</p>

<p>
But, as Chinner pointed out, 32KB is not likely to be the end of the line.
Even if the page size were increased to 32KB, disk drive manufacturers will
someday want 128KB or 256KB (or beyond) for the block size.  So a solution
that is not dependent on the page size of the system is needed.  Using
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> allocations rather than contiguous allocations might
help.  <a href="/Articles/619514/">Compound pages</a> might also be part of
any eventual solution.
</p>

<p>
In the end, Bottomley summed up the discussion by saying that filesystems
could "pull tricks" to make most I/O 32KB-friendly, but would need help
from the MM subsystem to have it all be aligned correctly.  Given the time
frames, it would seem
that drive makers need to do some kind of emulation for now.

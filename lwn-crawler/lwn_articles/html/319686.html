<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 17, 2009</br>
           </div>
One of the lesser-known functions supported by the kernel's memory
management code is <tt>ksize()</tt>; given a pointer to an object allocated
with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, <tt>ksize()</tt> will return the size of that
object.  This function is not often needed; callers to <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
usually know what they allocated.  It can be useful, though, in situations
where a function needs to know the size of an object and does not have that
information handy.  As it happens, there are other potential uses for
<tt>ksize()</tt>, but there are traps as well.
<p>
Users of <tt>ksize()</tt> in the mainline kernel are rare.  Until 2008, the
main user was the nommu architecture code, which was <a
href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/22/226">found to be using
<tt>ksize()</tt> in a number of situations</a> where that use was not
appropriate.  The result was a cleanup of the nommu code and the
un-exporting of <tt>ksize()</tt> in an attempt to prevent that sort of
situation from coming about again.
<p>
Happiness prevailed until recently; the 2.6.29-rc5 kernel includes <a
href="/Articles/319689/">a patch to the crypto code</a> which makes use of
<tt>ksize()</tt> to ensure that <tt>crypto_tfm</tt> structures are
completely wiped of sensitive data before being returned to the system.
The lack of an export for <tt>ksize()</tt> caused the crypto code to fail
when built as a module, so Kirill Shutemov posted <a
href="/Articles/319690/">a patch to export it</a>.  That's when the
discussion got interesting.
<p>
There was resistance to restoring the export for <tt>ksize()</tt>; the
biggest problem would appear to be that it's an easy function to use
incorrectly.  It is only really correct to call <tt>ksize()</tt> with a
pointer obtained from <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, but programmers seem to find
themselves tempted to use it on other types of objects as well.  This
situation is not helped by the fact that the SLAB and SLUB memory
allocators work just fine if any slab-allocated memory object is passed to
<tt>ksize()</tt>.  The SLOB allocator, instead, is not so accommodating.
An explanation of this situation led to <a href="/Articles/319691/">some
complaints</a> from Andrew Morton:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	OK.  This is really bad, isn't it?  People will write code which
	happily works under slab and slub, only to have it crash for those
	small number of people who (very much later) test with slob?
	<p>
	[...]
	<p>
	Gee this sucks.  Biggest mistake I ever made.  Are we working hard
	enough to remove some of these sl?b implementations?  Would it help
	if I randomly deleted a couple?
</div>
<p>
Thus far, no implementations have been deleted; indeed, it appears that the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/311502/">SLQB allocator</a> is headed for
inclusion in 2.6.30.  The idea of restricting access to <tt>ksize()</tt>
has also not gotten very far; the export of this function was restored for
2.6.29-rc5.  In the end, the kernel is full of dangerous functions - such
is the nature of kernel code - and it is not possible to defend against any
mistake which could be made by kernel developers.  As Matt Mackall <a
href="/Articles/319698/">put it</a>, this is just another basic mistake:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And it -is- a category error. The fact that kmalloc is implemented
	on top of kmem_cache_alloc is an implementation detail that callers
	should not assume. They shouldn't call kfree() on kmem_cache_alloc
	objects (even though it might just happen to work), nor should they
	call ksize().
</div>
<p>
There is another potential reason to keep this function available:  <tt>ksize()</tt>
may prove to have a use beyond freeing 
developers from the need to track the size of allocated objects.  One
poorly-kept secret about <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is that it tends to allocate
objects which are larger than the caller requests.  A quick look at
<tt>/proc/slabinfo</tt> will (with the right memory allocator) reveal a
number of caches with names like <tt>kmalloc-256</tt>.  Whenever a call to
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> is made, the requested size will be rounded up to the
next slab size, and an object of that size will be returned.  (Again, this
is true for the SLAB and SLUB allocators; SLOB is a special case).
<p>
This rounding-up results in a simpler and faster allocator, but those
benefits are gained at the cost of some wasted memory.  That is one of the
reasons why it makes sense to create a dedicated slab for
frequently-allocated objects.  There is one interesting allocation case
which is stuck with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, though, for DMA-compatibility
reasons: SKB (network packet buffer) allocations.
<p>
An SKB is typically sized to match the maximum transfer size for the
intended network interface.  In an Ethernet-dominated world, that size
tends to be 1500 bytes.  A 1500-byte object requested from
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> will typically result in the allocation a 2048-byte
chunk of memory; that's a significant amount of wasted RAM.  As it happens,
though, the network developers really need the SKB buffer to not cross page
boundaries, so there is generally no way to avoid that waste.
<p>
But there may be a way to take advantage of it.  Occasionally, the network
layer needs to store some extra data associated with a packet; IPSec, it
seems, is especially likely to create this type of situation.  The
networking layer could allocate more memory for that data, or it could use
<tt>krealloc()</tt> to expand the existing buffer allocation, but both will
slow down the highly-tuned networking core.  What would be a lot nicer
would be to just use some extra space that happened to be lying around.
With a buffer from <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, that space might just be there.
The way to find out, of course, is to use <tt>ksize()</tt>.  And that's
exactly what the networking developers intend to do.
<p>
Not everybody is convinced that this kind of trick is worth the trouble.
Some argue that the extra space should be allocated explicitly if it will
be needed later.  Others would like to see some benchmarks demonstrating
that there is a real-world benefit from this technique.  But, in the end,
kernel developers do appreciate a good trick.  So <tt>ksize()</tt> will be
there should this kind of code head for the mainline in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Couldn't krealloc() just use ksize() internally to speed up its operation?<br>

      I think <tt>krealloc()</tt> does use <tt>ksize()</tt>.  That's part of why it exists.
<p>
I don't know for sure, but my guess is that the networking folks don't like that approach because it requires copying the packet in the case where the needed room doesn't exist.  Networking hackers <i>hate</i> copying packets.  They would rather just allocated the extra space elsewhere if need be.

A quick check of mm/util.c confirms this. Initially I had no idea what the network developers are thinking. If the new size will fit in the original allocation, then no locks will be taken, no sleeping, etc.<br>
<p>
But then it occured to me that the code that needs to do the expansion may be holding locks and may be in interrupt context. Preparing to call krealloc may require releasing locks, etc, since it could take locks.<br>

So why not just a enlarge-without-copying call? Call it "krealloc_no_copy", which tries to enlarge a memory reservation if it can do it without copying, and returns null if that turned out to be impossible -- in that situation the network guys can fall back to allocating a separate metadata block.<br>

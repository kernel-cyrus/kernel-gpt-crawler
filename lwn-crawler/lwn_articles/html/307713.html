           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>November 19, 2008</br>

<p>
Arnd Bergmann pulled double duty at the recent <a
href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/">UKUUG Linux 2008
conference</a> by giving a talk on each day of the event.  His talk on
Saturday, entitled "Porting Linux to a new architecture, the right way",
looked at various problems with recent architecture ports along with a
project he has been working on to simplify that process.  By creating a
generic template for architectures, some of the mistakes of the past can be
avoided. 
</p>

<p>
This is one of Bergmann's pet projects, that "<q>I like to do for fun,
when I am hacking on the kernel, but not for IBM</q>".  The project and
talk were inspired by a few new architectures that were merged&mdash;or
were submitted for merging&mdash;in the
last few years.  In particular, the Blackfin and MicroBlaze architectures
were inspiring, with the latter architecture still not merged, perhaps due
to Bergmann's comments.  He is hoping to help that situation get better.
</p>

<p>
The biggest problem with architecture ports tends to be code duplication
because people start by copying all of the files from an existing
architecture.  In addition, "<q>most people who don't know what they are
doing copy from x86, which in my opinion is a big mistake</q>".
According to Bergmann, architecture porters seem to "<q>first copy the
header files and then change the whitespace</q>", which makes it
difficult to immediately spot duplicated code.
</p>

<p>
He points to <tt>termbits.h</tt> as an example of an include file that is
duplicated in multiple architectures unnecessarily as the code is the same
in most cases.  He also notes there is "<q>incorrect code
duplication</q>", pointing to new architectures that implement the
<tt>sys_ipc()</tt> system call, resulting in "<q>brand new architectures
supporting a broken interface for x86 UNIX from the 80s</q>".  That call
is a de-multiplexer for System V IPC calls that has the
comment&mdash;dutifully duplicated into other architectures&mdash;"This is
really 
horribly ugly".
</p>

<p>
Then there are problems with "<q>code duplication by clueless
people</q>" which 
includes a <tt>sembuf.h</tt> implementation that puts the padding in the
wrong place because of 64 vs. 32-bit confusion.  In addition, because
code is duplicated in multiple 
locations, bug fixes that are made for one architecture don't propagate to
all the places that need the fix.  As an example he noted a bug fix made by
Sparc maintainer David Miller in the x86 tree that didn't make it into the
Sparc tree.  Finally, there are ABIs that are being needlessly propagated
in new architecture ports: system calls that are implemented in terms
of newer calls are still present in new ports even though it could all be
handled in libc.
</p>

<p>
The "obvious" solution is to create a generic architecture implementation
that can be 
used as a starting point for new ports.  Bergmann has been working on that,
resulting in a 3000 line patch that "<q>should make it very easy for
people to port to new architectures</q>".   To start with, it defines a
canonical ABI that is a list of all of the system calls that need to be
implemented for a new architecture.  It puts all of the required include
files into the <tt>asm-generic</tt> directory that new ports can just
include&mdash;or copy if they need to modify them.   
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, things are not quite that simple of course, there are a number
of problem areas.  There are "<q>lots of things you simply cannot do in
a generic way</q>".  Most of these things are fairly hardware-specific
areas like MMU support, atomics, interrupts, task switching, byte order,
signal contexts, hardware probing and the like.
</p>

<p>
Bergmann decided to go ahead by defining away some of these problems in
his <tt>example</tt> architecture.  So, there is no SMP or MMU support with the
<tt>asm-generic/atomic.h</tt> and <tt>asm-generic/mmu_context.h</tt>
include files being appropriately modified.  Many of the
architecture-specific functions have been stubbed out in
<tt>arch/example/kernel/dummy.c</tt> so that he can compile the template
architecture. 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>example</tt> architecture uses an Open Firmware device tree to
describe the hardware that is available at boot time.  Open Firmware
"<q>is a bit like what you have with the new Intel EFI firmware, but
it's a lot nicer</q>".  A flattened device tree data structure is passed
to the kernel at boot time by the bootloader, so Bergmann will be able make
it to the next step: making it boot.
</p>

<p>
As one might guess, there is still more work to be done.
There are eight header files that are needed from the
<tt>asm-example</tt> directory, but Bergmann hopes to reduce that some.  He
notes that there are other architecture-specific areas that need work.  For
example, 
every single architecture has its own implementation of TCP 
checksums in assembly language, which may not be optimal
</p>

<p>
Bergmann pointed attendees at the <tt>ukuug2008</tt> branch of his
kernel.org playground git tree: <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/arnd/playground.git;a=shortlog;h=ukuug2008">git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arnd/playground.git</a>
to see the current state of his example architecture.  It looks to be a
nice addition to the kernel that will likely result in better architecture
ports down the road.

my first reaction to this is that this approach of defining a generic architecture is a really good one, it should be followed up by building a hardware emulator for this architecture.<br>
<p>
properly done this could end up being effectively the same thing as user mode linux, but without the x86 dependency.<br>

Having a master architecture that all the other architectures can derive from sounds an awful lot like branching in git.<br>

My git tree was unfortunately lost in the transition of the kernel.org infrastructure. If anyone is looking at porting a new architecture and stumbling over this article, please have a look at the latest OpenRISC source in the kernel, it looks very nice and can serve as an example.<br>

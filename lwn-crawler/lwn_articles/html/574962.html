Power management is an increasingly important responsibility of
almost every subsystem in the Linux kernel. One of the most established power
management mechanisms in the kernel is the <a
href="/Articles/384146/">cpuidle framework</a> which puts idle 
CPUs into sleeping states until they have work to do. These sleeping
states are called the "C-states" or CPU operating states. The deeper a C-state,
the more power is conserved. 
<p>
However, an interesting problem surfaces when CPUs
enter certain deep C-states.  Idle CPUs are typically woken up by their
respective local timers 
when there is work to be done, but what happens if these CPUs enter deep
C-states in which these timers stop working? Who will wake up the CPUs in time
to handle the work scheduled on them?

This is where the "tick broadcast framework" steps in.  It assigns a clock
device that is not affected by the C-states of the CPUs as the timer
responsible
for handling the wakeup of all those CPUs that enter deep C-states.

<p>
<h4>Overview of the tick broadcast framework</h4>
<p>
In the case of an idle or a semi-idle system, there could be more than one
CPU entering a deep idle state where the local timer stops. These CPUs may
have different wakeup times. How is it possible to keep track of when to
wake up the CPUs, considering a timer is merely a clock device that cannot
keep track of more information than the time at which it is supposed to
interrupt? The tick broadcast framework in the kernel provides the
necessary infrastructure to handle the wakeup of such CPUs at the right time.
<p>
Before looking into the tick broadcast framework, it is important to understand
how the CPUs themselves keep track locally of when their respective pending
events need to be run.
<p>
The kernel keeps track of the time at which a deferred task
needs to be run based on the concept of timeouts. The timeouts are
implemented using clock devices called timers which have the capacity to
raise an interrupt at a specified time. In the kernel, such devices are called
the "clock event" devices.  Each CPU is equipped with a local clock event
device that is programmed to interrupt at the time of the next-to-run
deferred task on 
that CPU, so that said task can be scheduled on the CPU. These local clock
event devices can also be programmed to fire periodically to do regular
housekeeping jobs like updating the <tt>jiffies</tt> value, checking if a
task has to be 
scheduled out, etc. These timers are therefore called the "tick devices" in the
kernel and are represented by <tt>struct&nbsp;tick_device</tt>.
<p>
A per-CPU <tt>tick_device</tt> representing the local timer is declared using the
variable <tt>tick_cpu_device</tt>. Every CPU keeps track of when its local timer
needs to interrupt it next in its copy of <tt>tick_cpu_device</tt> as <tt>next_event</tt> and
programs the local timer with this value. To be more precise, the value can be
found in <tt>tick_cpu_device-&gt;evtdev-&gt;next_event</tt>, where <tt>evtdev</tt> is an instance of
the clock event device mentioned above.
<p>
The external clock device that is required to stand in for the local timers in
some deep idle states is just another tick device, but is not normally
required to 
keep track of events for specific CPUs. This device is represented by
<tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt> (defined in
<tt>kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c</tt>), in contrast to
<tt>tick_cpu_device</tt>. 
<p>
<h4>Registering a timer as the tick_broadcast_device</h4>
<p>
During the initialization of the kernel, every timer in the system registers
itself as a <tt>tick_device</tt>. In the kernel, these timers are
associated with some 
flags which define their properties. That property which is of special
interest to us is represented by the flag <tt>CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP</tt>. This means
that in the C3 idle state, the timer stops. Although the C3 idle state is
specific to the x86 architecture, this feature flag is generally used to
convey that the timer stops in one of the deep idle states.
<p>
Any timers which do not have the flag <tt>CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP</tt> set are
potential candidates for <tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt>. Since all local
timers have 
this flag set on architectures where they stop in deep idle states, all of
them become ineligible for this role. On architectures like x86, there is an
external device called the HPET — High Precision Event Timer — which becomes a
suitable candidate. Since the HPET is placed external to the processor, the idle
power management for a CPU does not affect it. Naturally it does not
have the <tt>CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP</tt> flag set among its properties and becomes the
choice for <tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt>.
<p>
<h4>Tracking the CPUs in deep idle states</h4>
<p>
Now we'll return to the way the tick broadcast framework keeps track of when
to wake up the CPUs that enter idle states when their local timers stop.
 	Just before a CPU enters such an idle state, it calls into the tick
broadcast framework. This CPU is then added to a list of CPUs to be woken up;
specifically, a bit is set for this CPU in a "broadcast mask".
<p>
Then a check is made to see if the time at which this CPU has to be woken up is
prior to the time at which the <tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt> has been currently programmed.
If so, the time at which the <tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt> should interrupt is updated
to reflect the new value and this value is programmed into the external timer.
The <tt>tick_cpu_device</tt> of the CPU that is going to deep idle state is now put in
<tt>CLOCK_EVT_MODE_SHUTDOWN</tt> mode, meaning that it is no longer functional.
<p>
Each time a CPU goes to deep idle state, the above steps are repeated and the
<tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt> is programmed to fire at the earliest of the
wakeup times of the CPUs in deep idle states.
<p>
<h4>Waking up the CPUs in deep idle states</h4>
<p>
When the external timer expires, it interrupts one of the online CPUs, which scans
the list of CPUs that have asked to be woken up to check if any of their wakeup times have been reached. That means the current time is compared to the
<tt>tick_cpu_device-&gt;evtdev-&gt;next_event</tt> of each CPU. All those CPUs for which this
is true are added to a temporary mask (different from the broadcast mask) and
the appropriate next expiry time of the <tt>tick_broadcast_device</tt> is
set to the 
earliest wakeup time of those CPUs. What remains to be seen is how the
CPUs in the temporary mask are woken up.
<p>
Every tick device has a "broadcast method" associated with it. This method is
an architecture-specific function encapsulating the way inter-processor
interrupts (IPIs) are sent to a group
of CPUs. Similarly, each local timer is also associated with this method. The
broadcast method of the local timer of one of the CPUs in the temporary mask
is invoked by passing it the same mask. IPIs are then sent to all the CPUs that
are present in this mask. Since wakeup interrupts are sent to a group of
CPUs, this framework is called the "broadcast" framework. The broadcast is done
in <tt>tick_do_broadcast()</tt> in <tt>kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c</tt>.
<p>
The IPI handler for this specific interrupt needs to be that of the local timer
interrupt itself so that the CPUs in deep idle states wake up as if they were
interrupted by the local timers themselves. The effects of their local
timers stopping on entering an idle state is hidden away from them; they
should see the same state before and after wakeup and continue running like
nothing had happened.
<p>
While handling the IPI, the CPUs call into the tick broadcast framework so that
they can be removed from the broadcast mask, since it is known
that they have received the IPI and have woken up. Their respective tick
devices are brought out of the <tt>CLOCK_EVT_MODE_SHUTDOWN</tt> mode, indicating that
they are back to being functional.
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
As can be seen from the above discussion, enabling deep idle states cause
the kernel to have to do additional work. One would therefore
naturally wonder if it is worth going through this trouble, since it could
hamper performance in the process of saving power.
<p>
	Idle CPUs enter deep C-states only if they are predicted to remain
idle for a long time, on the order of milliseconds. Therefore, broadcast IPIs
should be well spaced in time and are not so frequent as to affect the performance of
the system. We could further optimize the tick broadcast framework by
aligning the wakeup time of the idle CPUs to a periodic tick boundary whose
interval is of the order of a few milliseconds so
that CPUs going to idle at almost the same time choose the same wakeup
time.  By looking at more such ways to
minimize the number of broadcast IPIs sent we could ensure that the overhead
involved is insignificant compared to the large power savings that the deep
idle states yield us. If this can be achieved, it is a good enough reason to
enable and optimize an infrastructure for the use of deep idle states.

Wondering if this wake-up mechanism is limited to timers only.<br>
<p>
E.g., what if you want to tie your wake-up to a video frame event, or a camera shutter, or an event indicating some sound sample consumer needs another bufferful of decompressed sound samples? Or if you want to have an arbitrary GPIO event wake you from your sleep?<br>
<p>
Another aspect: how much time does a waking CPU need for coffee and shower before it gets to work? I.e., is there a fixed latency hit that one could compensate for by requesting a slightly early wake-up signal?<br>
<p>
BTW, what happens to a CPU's cache while it is sleeping? Is it still snooping the memory bus and noting invalidated lines?<br>
<p>
Seems like being able to sleep waiting for invalidation of a particular line would make a nice hardware wait instruction to support a spin lock that could automatically convert itself to a sleeping (and potentially power saving) wait.<br>
<p>
It would also make a nice mechanism for inter-CPU signaling. All you'd have to do is write something to shared memory within the line being cached and waited for by the receiving CPU. (Just in case, please feel free to use this post for anti-patent-troll purposes if so usable ;-)<br>

On the first question: all such external IRQs are first arbitrated before arriving at a certain CPU for handling. This means a CPU-external interrupt controller decides which CPU to wake up. It is woken up by the hardware IRQ line into the CPU. The CPU will then go to an interrupt handler and after that check for pending events again before going back to idle. On some systems all hardware IRQs are routed to CPU0.<br>
<p>
If you *don't* want to be woken up by a certain hardware interrupt they are possible to mask off by letting your device driver call irq_set_wake(). The will then be masked off by the interrupt controller and not forwarded to the target CPU. If this is a level interrupt it will be handled the next time the CPU wakes up, if it is still asserted.<br>
<p>
The external interrupt controller may sometimes *also* be shut down. Then the system has some hardware bootstrapping for bringing it back online before routing and delivering the interrupt.<br>
<p>
Hope this is clear and easy to understand...<br>

      <p>All interrupts wake the CPU if needed - the framework discussed in this article is describing how Linux sets up a timer interrupt to wake a deeply sleeping CPU when there's known to be work for it to do. Thus, if you want to tie your wake-up to an external event, you just sleep waiting for the IRQ.
<p>CPUs have various latencies when waking up - deeper sleep has higher latency; if you look at drivers/idle/intel_idle.c in your favourite kernel source browser, you'll find wake up latencies (exit_latency, in units of microseconds) and target residencies (also in microsecond units) of various Intel CPUs. Wake up latency is the time it takes the CPU to go from sleeping to running, target residency is the time the CPU needs to spend in the sleep state in order to save power.
<p>A CPU's cache behaviour varies, depending on how deep the sleep actually is; in "light" sleep states, it still snoops as you'd expect, while in deeper sleep, the cache is completely flushed and powered down.
<p>Modern Intel CPUs can do the hardware wait you describe - look up the MONITOR/MWAIT instruction pair, which permit you to wait until there's a write to a given location or an external wake event.

It seems like it would be most efficient to have the tick broadcast device directly interrupt the CPU that has the next wakeup due.  In the presumably common case where that CPU ends up being the only one in the temporary mask, no IPIs will be necessary.<br>

           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The plenary day at the 2013 Kernel Summit included an hour-long block of
time for the discussion of various scalability techniques.  It was, in a
sense, a set of brief tutorials for kernel developers wanting to know more
about how to use some of the more advanced mechanisms available in the
kernel.
<p>
<h4>Memory barriers</h4>
<p>
Paul McKenney started with a discussion of memory barriers — processor
instructions used to ensure that memory operations are carried out in a

<a href="/Articles/572134/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/PaulMcKenney-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Paul McKenney]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

specific order.  Normally, Paul said, memory barriers cannot be used by
themselves; instead, they must be used in pairs.  So, for example, a
typical memory barrier usage would follow a scheme like this:
<p>
<ol>
<li> The writer side fills a structure with interesting data, then sets a
     flag to indicate that the structure's contents are valid.  It is
     important that no other processor see the "valid" flag as being set
     until the structure changes are visible there.  To make that happen,
     the writer process will execute a write memory barrier between filling
     the structure and setting the flag.
<p>
<li> The reader process knows that, once it sees the flag set, the contents
     of the structure are valid.  But that only works if the instructions
     reading the flag and the structure are not reordered within the
     processor.  To ensure that, a read barrier is placed between the
     reading of the flag and subsequent operations.
</ol>
<p>
Paul noted that memory barriers can be expensive; might there be something
cheaper?  That may not be possible in an absolute sense, but there is a
mechanism by which the cost can be shifted to one side of the operation:
read-copy-update (RCU).  RCU splits time into "grace periods"; any critical
section that begins before the start of a grace period is guaranteed to
have completed by the end of that grace period.  Code that is concerned
with concurrency can use RCU's synchronization calls to wait for a grace
period to complete in the knowledge that all changes done within that grace
period will be globally visible at the end.  
<p>
Doing things in this way
shifts the entire cost to the side making the synchronization call, which
is sufficient in many situations.  For the cases where it is not, one can
use RCU callbacks, but that leads to some other interesting situations.
But that was the subject of the next talk.
<p>
<h4>RCU-correct data structures</h4>
<p>
Josh Triplett took over to try to make the task of creating data structures
that function properly with RCU a less-tricky task.  The mental model for
ordinary locking, he said, is relatively easy for most developers to
understand.  RCU is harder, with the result that most RCU-protected data

<a href="/Articles/572135/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/JoshTriplett-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Josh Triplett]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

structures are "cargo-culted."  If the data structure looks something like
a linked list, he said, it's pretty easy to figure out what is going on.
Otherwise, the process is harder; he described it as "construct an ordering
scenario where things go wrong, add a barrier to fix it, repeat, go
insane." 
<p>
There is a simpler way, he said.  Developers should forget about trying to
get a handle on overlapping operations, possible reordering of operations,
etc., and just assume that a reader can run atomically between every pair
of writes.  That leads to a pair of relatively straightforward rules:
<p>
<ul>
<li> On the reader side: <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> should be used for 
     pointer traversal, <tt>smp_rmb()</tt> should be used to place barriers
     between independent reads, and the entire critical section should be
     enclosed within an RCU read lock.
<p>
<li> For writers, there are two possibilities.  If writes are done in the
     same order that readers will read the data, then
     <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> should be used between writes.  If they are
     done in the opposite order, use <tt>smp_wmb()</tt> or
     <tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt> to insert a write memory barrier.  There
     is no need for an expensive synchronize call in this case.
</ul>
<p>
Those two rules, Josh contends, are all that is ever needed to create safe
data structures protected by RCU.
<p>
Josh walked the group through a simple linked-list example.  Supposed you
have a simple linked list that looks like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/rcu-ll1.png" width=353 height=42
    alt="[Linked list]">
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to insert an item into the list without taking any locks, you
would start by setting the "next" pointer within the new item like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/rcu-ll2.png" width=353 height=102
    alt="[Linked list]">
</blockquote>
<p>
Once that is done, the list itself can be modified to include the new item: 
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/rcu-ll3.png" width=353 height=102
    alt="[Linked list]">
</blockquote>
<p>
Any code traversing the list concurrently will either see the new item or
it will not, but it will always see a correct list and not go off into the
weeds — as long as the two pointer assignments described above are visible
in the correct order.  To ensure that, one should apply Josh's rules.
Since these pointer assignments are done in the opposite order that a
reader will use to traverse the list, all that is needed is a memory
barrier between the writes and all will be well.
<p>
Removing an item from the list reverses the above process.  First, the list
is modified to route around the item to be taken out:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/rcu-ll4.png" width=353 height=102
    alt="[Linked list]">
</blockquote>
<p>
Once it's sure that no threads are using the to-be-removed item, it's
"next" link can be cleared:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/rcu-ll5.png" width=353 height=102
    alt="[Linked list]">
</blockquote>
<p>
...and the item itself can be freed.  In this case, the writes are
happening in the same order that the reader would use.  So it is necessary
to use <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> between the two steps to guarantee that
the doomed item is truly no longer in use before freeing it.  It is also
possible, of course, to just use <tt>call_rcu()</tt> to complete the job
and free the item asynchronously after the end of the grace period.
<p>
<a name="elision"></a>
<h4>Lock elision</h4>
<p>
Andi Kleen talked for a while about the use of transactional memory to
eliminate the taking of locks in many situations; Andi  <a
href="/Articles/534758/">described this technique in some detail</a> in an

<a href="/Articles/572136/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/AndiKleen-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Andi Kleen]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="left"></a>

LWN article last January.  Lock elision, he said, is much simpler to work
with than RCU and, if the conditions are right, it can also be faster.
<p>
Transactional memory, he said, is functionally the same as having an independent
lock on each cache line in memory.  It is based on speculative execution
within CPUs, something that they have been doing for years; transactional
memory just makes that speculation visible.  This feature is rolling out on
Intel processors now; it will be available throughout the server space
within a year.  There are a lot of potential uses for transactional memory,
but he's restricting his work to lock elision in order to keep the existing
kernel programming models.
<p>
With regard to which locks should be elided, Andi said that he prefers to
just enable it for everything.  It can be hard to predict which locks will
elide well when the kernel runs.  Ben Herrenschmidt complained that in some
cases prediction is easy: overly large critical sections will always abort,
forcing a fallback to regular locking.  Memory-mapped I/O operations will
also kill things.
<p>
Will Deacon asked whether the lock-elision code took any steps to ensure
fairness among lock users.  Andi replied that there is no need; lock
elision only happens if there is no contention (and, thus, no fairness
issue) for the lock.  Otherwise things fall back to the regular locking
code, which can implement fairness in the usual ways.
<p>
Linus said that, sometimes, lock elision can be slower than just taking the
lock, but Andi disagreed.  The only time when elision would be slower is if
the transaction aborts and, in that case, there's contention and somebody
would have blocked anyway.  Linus pointed out that Intel still has not
posted any performance numbers for lock elision within the kernel; he
assumes that means that the numbers are bad.  Andi did not address the lack
of numbers directly, but he did say that elision allows developers to go
back to coarser, faster locking.  
<p>
He concluded by suggesting that, rather than add a bunch of hairy
scalability code to the kernel, it might be better to wait a year and just
use lock elision.
<p>
<h4>SRCU</h4>
<p>
The final talk of the scalability session was given by Lai Jaingshan, who
discussed the "sleepable" variant of the RCU mechanism.  Normally, RCU
critical sections run in atomic context and cannot sleep, but there are

<a href="/Articles/572137/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/LaiJiangshan-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Lai Jiangshan]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

cases where a reader needs to block while holding an RCU read lock.  There
are also, evidently, situations where a separate RCU domain is useful, or
when code is running on an offline CPU that does not take part in the grace
period mechanism.
<p>
SRCU was introduced in 2006; Paul McKenney <a
href="/Articles/202847/">documented it on LWN</a> at that time.  It turned
out to be too slow, however, requiring a lot of expensive calls and a
per-CPU counter wait for every critical section.  So SRCU was reworked in
2012 by Paul and Lai.  Updates can happen much more quickly now, with no
synchronization calls required; it also has a new <tt>call_srcu()</tt>
primitive. 
<p>
There are about sixty users of SRCU in the 3.11 kernel, the biggest of
which is the KVM hypervisor code.  Lai provided an overview of the SRCU
API, but it went quickly and it's doubtful that many in the audience picked
up much of it.  Consulting the code and the documentation in the kernel
tree would be the best way to start working with the SRCU mechanism.

It seems optimistic to assume that everyone experiencing scalability problems will upgrade their (often huge, expensive) systems on an annual basis, in the teeth of a recession!
<p>
Intel might like things to work that way, but, uh, they don't.

      Yes but...most scalability work is aimed at the next generation of systems anyway, so it's not quite as tone-deaf as one might think.

It was suggested that we may need to find out dynamically which transactions usually fail and then stop trying to use lock elision there. The current Intel implementation does not track this, but it does report why a transaction was aborted and that may be enough to make the decision.<br>

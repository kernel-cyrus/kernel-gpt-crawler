<h1>A new version of modversions</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 26, 2024</br>
           </div>
The <tt>genksyms</tt> tool has long been buried deeply within the kernel's
build system; it is one of the two C-code parsers shipped with the kernel
(the other being <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11-rc4/source/scripts/kernel-doc">the
horrifying <tt>kernel-doc</tt> script</a>).  It is a key part of how the
kernel's module-loading infrastructure works.  While <tt>genksyms</tt> has
quietly done its job for decades, that period may soon be coming to an end.
It would seem that <tt>genksyms</tt> is not up to the task of handling Rust
code, so Sami Tolvanen is <a
href="/ml/all/20240815173903.4172139-21-samitolvanen@google.com/">proposing
a new tool</a> to handle this task going forward.
<p>
In the early days, the kernel only supported monolithic builds; there was
no concept of loadable modules.  That changed with the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=a4c5b0f7436">0.99.15
release</a> in early 1994, which added module support along with a number
of other features.  That release also was the beginning of the "code
freeze" for the 1.0 release; Linus Torvalds said at the time:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Bumping the linux version number to 1.0 doesn't mean anything more
  	than that: it's only a version number change.  More explicitly, it
  	does *NOT* mean that linux will become commercial (the copyright
  	will remain as-is), nor does it mean that development stops here,
  	and that 1.0 will be anything special in that respect.
</blockquote>
<p>
Loadable modules at that time were tied to the specific version of the
kernel they were built for.  As Linux steadily became more commercial,
though, there was an increase in interest in the ability to load a given
binary module into multiple kernel versions.  That interest was especially
strong among those who were shipping out-of-tree modules and wanted those
modules to work in as many kernels as possible.

</blockquote>
<p>
Then, as is the case now, modules hooked into the rest of the kernel by way
of exported symbols.  Only symbols (corresponding to functions or
variables) that have been explicitly exported are available to a loadable
module, and modules can export symbols of their own as well.  When a module
is compiled to use a specific symbol, it naturally incorporates the type
information associated with that symbol.  Any change to a symbol (adding a
parameter to a function prototype, for example, or rearranging the fields
in a structure definition) will break modules that use those symbols,
possibly in subtle and unpleasant ways.
<p>
<h4>The beginning of modversions</h4>
<p>
Kernel development has always moved quickly; that results in many changes
to the interface seen by loadable modules.  There was some pressure to try
to minimize such changes in the early days, but the project's policy has
always been that the kernel's internal interfaces can change at any time.
The best that maintainers of out-of-tree modules can do is to notice the
changes and update their code accordingly.
<p>
Even noticing the changes can be hard, though, since kernel developers do
not normally worry much about making changes evident to external code.  But
that is a job that computers are well suited for.  So, the 1.1.85 release
(January 1995) added the first "modversions" support, intended to allow
modules to be loaded into multiple kernel versions — and to make it clear
when that is not possible.
<p>
At the core of modversions is <tt>genksyms</tt>.  This tool reads and
parses a C source file that has been run through the preprocessor, collects
the definition of every symbol exported by that file, calculates a checksum
of each definition, and outputs the result in a form that the build process
can access.  The kernel's <tt>modpost</tt> tool then uses that information
to create a C source file that populates a special ELF section with symbols
(both exported and used) along with their checksums.  The curious can see
<a href="/Articles/986905/">an example</a> of what that file looks like.
When the time comes to load a module, the loader
compares the checksum of every symbol used by that module against the
checksums for the running kernel; if the two match, then the module can be
loaded safely.
<p>
<tt>genksyms</tt> was initially shipped separately from the kernel in the
<tt>modutils</tt> package; that <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=46bd1da672d">changed</a>
for the 2.5.64 development kernel in February 2003, when it was moved into
the kernel's <tt>scripts</tt> directory.  The tool has been maintained over
the years without huge changes; it has seen (slightly) fewer than 100
patches during the Git era.  
<p>
<tt>genksyms</tt> has been able to work for so long because the declaration
of a function or data structure in C fully describes the interface to the
resulting binary object, at least once the options passed to the compiler
are taken into account.  The compiler is not going to rearrange things into
a form that, for whatever reason, it likes better.  But, as Tolvanen
explains, the same is not true for Rust:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Unlike C, Rust source code doesn't have sufficient information
	about the final ABI, as the compiler has considerable freedom in
	adjusting structure layout for improved performance, for example,
	which makes using a source code parser like genksyms a non-starter.
</blockquote>
<p>
As a result of this problem, a kernel configuration cannot simultaneously
enable both modversions and Rust.  Naturally, this is not welcome news for
anybody who wants to enable Rust and still load binary modules into
multiple kernel versions.  Since Android falls into that category, it is
not surprising that some attention has gone toward remedying this
situation.
<p>
<h4>Tossing DWARF at Rust</h4>
<p>
Teaching <tt>genksyms</tt> how to parse Rust would not be a small job and,
as noted above, it would not be a sufficient solution in any case.  The
chosen solution, instead, is to stop parsing the code and trying to
second-guess the compiler; instead, the DWARF debugging information
produced by the compiler, which fully describes the interfaces of interest,
is used.  Taking this approach, the new <tt>gendwarfksyms</tt> tool can
conceivably do symbol versioning for code written in any language.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240617175818.58219-17-samitolvanen@google.com/">first
version of this patch set</a> used the new tool to generate checksums for
Rust code, while retaining the existing machinery for C code.  Modules
maintainer Luis Chamberlain had <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZnHjO7x9nszs9pUC@bombadil.infradead.org/">suggested</a>,
though, that it should just be used for all code, so that is what the
current series does.
<p>
This solution seems promising, but it not without its downsides.  The new
tool can only process the DWARF data if it exists, meaning that the kernel
must be compiled with full debugging information enabled.  That is not
necessarily a problem for distributors, since they typically want that
information anyway, but generating all that information slows down the
build process significantly.  Build-time regressions for the kernel get
developer attention more quickly than almost any other kind of problem, so
this change may not be universally welcomed.

<p>
While <tt>gendwarfksyms</tt> generates checksums like <tt>genksyms</tt>
does, it does not generate the <i>same</i> checksums.  Switching an
existing kernel to use <tt>gendwarfksyms</tt> will thus result in all
checksums changing, and any existing modules will no longer be loadable.
That makes this switch into a sort of flag day that would have to be
carefully managed by distributors.
<p>
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11-rc4/source/include/linux/module.h#L37"><tt>modversion_info</tt>
structure</a> used to hold symbol names and checksums is limited to names
that are no longer than 55&nbsp;characters; after all, that should be
enough for anybody.  But it is not enough for the Rust compiler, which uses
name mangling to encode type information into identifiers.  Changing that
structure would break user-space tools, and is thus not an easy option.
The first version of the series hashed longer names to make them fit into
the available space, but that behavior has been removed in the second posting;
instead, a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240806212106.617164-1-mmaurer@google.com/">separate
effort</a> by Matthew Maurer is working toward making the representation of
this information more flexible.
<p>
Another interesting challenge was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/0b2697fd-7ab4-469f-83a6-ec9ebc701ba0@suse.com/">described</a>
by Petr Pavlu.  There are distributors that try to maintain ABI
compatibility for kernel modules, even though the kernel project itself is
indifferent (or hostile) to that goal.  One trick they use is to identify
data structures that, they think, may gain additional elements over the
support life of their kernel.  Those structures will be augmented with some
placeholder fields that are compiled out when <tt>__GENKSYMS__</tt> is set,
which only happens during <tt>genksyms</tt> runs.  That allows them to, at
some future time, change the type of that field while hiding the change
from <tt>genksyms</tt>, and thus avoiding an apparent ABI change.
<p>
The first version of the series did not support this feature, but it was
added in the second.  Use of preprocessor macros will not work when dealing
with DWARF data, though; a different approach is needed.  So, instead, a
different hack was developed using the names of the symbols.  The new
mechanism is described in <a
href="/ml/all/20240815173903.4172139-37-samitolvanen@google.com">this
patch</a>; imagine a kernel structure that has been augmented in a
distribution's kernel with a
placeholder field like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct struct1 {
    	long a;
    	<b>long __kabi_reserved_0; /* reserved for future use */</b>
    };
</pre>
<p>
<tt>gendwarfksyms</tt> recognizes the <tt>__kabi_reserved_</tt> prefix,
especially when it appears in unions.  At some future time, the above
structure could be changed to something like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct struct1 {
    	long a;
    	union {
            long __kabi_reserved_0;
      	    struct {
                int b;
          	int v;
      	    };
        };
    };
</pre>
<p>
The DWARF data describing this structure will change accordingly, but
<tt>gendwarfksyms</tt> will replace the union with just the definition of
<tt>__kabi_reserved_0</tt>, with the result that the structure appears
unchanged for the purpose of checksum generation.
<p>
There was some ongoing discussion about this last trick, especially with
regard to how it would work on the Rust side.  Bare union types run counter
to the Rust way of doing things since they provide no way to ensure that the
correct field is used at any given time, so there has been talk of
providing something a bit more complex.
<p>
There is also some concern about how the overall approach will interact
with link-time optimization, which will currently slow the build process
even more; this series currently explicitly conflicts with link-time
optimization for that reason.  For the most part, though, reviewers seem
reasonably happy with the current form of the patch series.  Once a
solution to the long-name problem has been worked out, entry into the
mainline may follow soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There seems to be some overlap between this and existing tools in the Rust space like cargo-semver-checks and cargo-public-api, especially when it comes to the display of the root cause of a change (which is often an API change as well as an ABI change). Maybe it would make sense to think about developing a more general approach to this problem in the compilers directly instead of just something in the kernel project, paralleling standards like ELF and DWARF for compiler outputs so display and analysis tooling could be built on top of that and it could be enabled and disabled independently?<br>

I like the idea of more-general tooling and managed interfaces. <br>
<p>
Say if you wanted to keep the old ernel promises about compatibility but also refactor some interfaces, you could have done codegen in the compiler tobplub data sent to the compat interface to the new format, and only invoke the compat interface if a binary is run that doesn't have ELF fields to explicitly state a magic number for kernel-release-abi (say a hash of the git release tag plus the syscall ID's it requires).<br>
<p>
Say if cloud providers insist on an ELF extension that has explicit system call allow-list and will kill running programs that overstep this boundary, that's also going to need tooling that records the intended syscall lists. (It's not perfect security, but it might make rop-gadgets harder to assemble, might make stack-spraying hard to succeed ... and was probably invented first by grsec.)<br>

Some years back, I was caught in a weak moment and somehow became the
kernel documentation maintainer.  More recently, I've given a few talks on
the state of kernel documentation and the sort of work that needs to be
done to make things better.  A key part of getting that work done is
communicating to potential contributors the tasks that they might helpfully
take on — a list that was, naturally, entirely undocumented.  To that end,
a version of the following document is currently under review and headed
for the mainline.  Read on to see how you, too, can help to make the
kernel's documentation better.
<p>

<h4>How to help improve kernel documentation</h4>
<p>
Documentation is an important part of any software-development project.
Good documentation helps to bring new developers in and helps established
developers work more effectively.  Without top-quality documentation, a lot
of time is wasted in reverse-engineering the code and making avoidable
mistakes.  With good documentation, instead, the result can be a project
that is more effective and more inclusive.
<p>
Unfortunately, the kernel's documentation currently falls far short of what
it needs to be to support a project of this size and importance.
<p>
This guide is for contributors who would like to improve that situation.
Kernel documentation improvements can be made by developers at a variety of
skill levels; they are a relatively easy way to learn the kernel process in
general and find a place in the community.  
There is an endless list of tasks that need to be carried out to get our
documentation to where it should be.  This list contains a number of
important items, but is far from exhaustive; if you see a different way to
improve the documentation, please do not hold back.
<p>
<h4>Addressing warnings</h4>

<p>
The documentation build currently spews out an unbelievable number of
warnings.  When you have that many warnings, you might as well have none at all;
people ignore them, and they will never notice when their work adds new
ones.  For this reason, eliminating warnings is one of the highest-priority
tasks on the documentation to-do list.  The task itself is reasonably
straightforward, but it must be approached in the right way to be
successful.
<p>
Warnings issued by a compiler for C code can often be dismissed as false
positives, leading to patches aimed at simply shutting the compiler up.
Warnings from the documentation build almost always point at a real
problem; making those warnings go away requires understanding the problem
and fixing it at its source.  For this reason, patches fixing documentation
warnings should probably not say "fix a warning" in the changelog title;
they should indicate the real problem that has been fixed.
<p>
Another important point is that documentation warnings are often created by
problems in kerneldoc comments in C code.  While the documentation
maintainer appreciates being copied on fixes for these warnings, the
documentation tree is often not the right one to actually carry those
fixes; they should go to the maintainer of the subsystem in question.
<p>
For example, I grabbed a pair of warnings nearly
at random from a 5.5-rc7 documentation build:
<p>
<pre>
    ./drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c:1818: warning: bad line:
  	  - Resource-managed devfreq_register_notifier()
    ./drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c:1854: warning: bad line:
	  - Resource-managed devfreq_unregister_notifier()
</pre>
<p>
(The lines were split for readability).
<p>
A quick look at the source file named above turned up a couple of kerneldoc
comments that look like this:
<p>
<pre>
  /**
   * devm_devfreq_register_notifier()
	  - Resource-managed devfreq_register_notifier()
   * @dev:	The devfreq user device. (parent of devfreq)
   * @devfreq:	The devfreq object.
   * @nb:		The notifier block to be unregistered.
   * @list:	DEVFREQ_TRANSITION_NOTIFIER.
   */
</pre>
<p>
The problem is the missing "<tt>*</tt>", which confuses the build system's
simplistic idea of what C comment blocks look like.  This problem had been
present since that comment was added in 2016 — a full four years.  Fixing
it was a matter of adding the missing asterisks.  A quick look at the
history for that file showed what the normal format for subject lines in
the target subsystem is,
and <tt>scripts/get_maintainer.pl</tt> told me who should receive the patch.  The
resulting patch looked like this:
<p>
<pre>
    [PATCH] PM / devfreq: Fix two malformed kerneldoc comments

    Two kerneldoc comments in devfreq.c fail to adhere to the required format,
    resulting in these doc-build warnings:

      ./drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c:1818: warning: bad line:
    	  - Resource-managed devfreq_register_notifier()
      ./drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c:1854: warning: bad line:
	  - Resource-managed devfreq_unregister_notifier()

    Add a couple of missing asterisks and make kerneldoc a little happier.

<p>

The entire process only took a few minutes, and the fix was mailed off with
pride.  Of course, I then found that somebody else had fixed this problem
in a separate tree, highlighting another lesson: always check linux-next to
see if a problem has been fixed before you dig into it.

<p>
Other fixes will take longer, especially those relating to structure
members or function parameters that lack documentation.  In such cases, it
is necessary to work out what the role of those members or parameters is
and describe them correctly.  Overall, this task gets a little tedious at
times, but it's highly important.  If we can actually eliminate warnings
from the documentation build, then we can start expecting developers to
avoid adding new ones.
<p>
<h4>Languishing kerneldoc comments</h4>
<p>
Developers are encouraged to write kerneldoc comments for their code, but
many of those comments are never pulled into the docs build.  That makes
this information harder to find and, for example, makes Sphinx unable to
generate links to that documentation.  Adding <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/doc-guide/kernel-doc.html#including-kernel-doc-comments"><tt>kernel-doc</tt>
directives</a> to the
documentation to bring those comments in can help the community derive the
full value of the work that has gone into creating them.
<p>
The <tt>scripts/find-unused-docs.sh</tt> tool can be used to find these
overlooked comments.
<p>
Note that the most value comes from pulling in the documentation for
exported functions and data structures.  Many subsystems also have
kerneldoc comments for internal use; those should not be pulled into the
documentation build unless they are placed in a document that is
specifically aimed at developers working within the relevant subsystem.
<p>

<h4>Typo fixes</h4>

<p>
Fixing typographical or formatting errors in the documentation is a quick
way to figure out how to create and send patches, and it is a useful
service.  I am always willing to accept such patches.  That said, once you
have fixed a few, please consider moving on to more advanced tasks, leaving
some typos for the next beginner to address.
<p>
Please note that some things are <i>not</i> typos and should not be "fixed":
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Both American and British English spellings are allowed within the
   kernel documentation.  There is no need to fix one by replacing it with
   the other.

<li> The question of whether a period should be followed by one or two spaces
   is not to be debated in the context of kernel documentation.  Other
   areas of rational disagreement, such as the "Oxford comma", are also
   off-topic here.
</ul>
<p>
As with any patch to any project, please consider whether your change is
really making things better.
<p>
<h4>Ancient documentation</h4>

<p>
Some kernel documentation is current, maintained, and useful.  Some
documentation is ... not.  Dusty, old, and inaccurate documentation can
mislead readers and casts doubt on our documentation as a whole.  Anything
that can be done to address such problems is more than welcome.
<p>
Whenever you are working with a document, please consider whether it is
current, whether it needs updating, or whether it should perhaps be removed
altogether.  Little value comes from fixing typos in a document full of
obsolete information. 
There are a number of warning signs that you can pay attention
to here:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> References to 2.x kernels
<li> Pointers to SourceForge repositories or mailing lists
<li> Nothing but typo fixes in the history for several years
<li> Discussion of pre-Git workflows
<li> Internal changelogs ending in 1997
</ul>
<p>
The best thing to do, of course, would be to bring the documentation
current, adding whatever information is needed.  Such work usually requires
the cooperation of developers familiar with the subsystem in question.
Developers are often more than willing to cooperate with people
working to improve the documentation when asked nicely, and when their
answers are listened to and acted upon.
<p>
Some documentation is beyond hope; we occasionally find documents that
refer to code that was removed from the kernel long ago, for example.
There is surprising resistance to removing obsolete documentation, but we
should do that anyway.  Extra cruft in our documentation helps nobody.
<p>
In cases where there is perhaps some useful information in a badly outdated
document, and you are unable to update it, the best thing to do may be to
add a warning at the beginning.  The following text is recommended:
<p>
<pre>
    .. warning ::
  	This document is outdated and in need of attention.  Please use
	this information with caution, and please consider sending patches
	to update it.
</pre>
<p>
That way, at least our long-suffering readers have been warned that the
document may lead them astray.
<p>
<h4>Documentation coherency</h4>

<p>
The old-timers around here will remember the Linux books that showed up on
the shelves in the 1990s.  They were simply collections of various
documentation files scrounged from numerous locations across the net.  The books
have (mostly) improved since then, but the kernel's documentation is still
mostly built on that model.  It is thousands of files, almost each of which
was written in isolation from all of the others.  We don't have a coherent
body of kernel documentation; we have thousands of individual documents.
<p>
We have been trying to improve the situation through the creation of
a set of "books" that group documentation for specific readers.  These
include
the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/index.html">user-space
API guide</a>, the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/index.html">development-process
manual</a>, the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/index.html">core API
manual</a>,
the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/index.html">user's
and administrator's guide</a>, and, naturally,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/doc-guide/index.html">the
documentation manual</a>, among others.
<p>
Moving documents into the appropriate books is an important task and needs
to continue.  There are a couple of challenges associated with this work, though.
Moving documentation files creates short-term pain for the people who work
with those files; they are understandably unenthusiastic about such
changes.  There is also often resistance to organizing documentation for
the convenience of its readers rather than that of its authors.
Usually the case can be made to move a document once; we really
don't want to keep shifting them around, though.
<p>
Even when all documents are in the right place, though, we have only
managed to turn a big pile into a group of smaller piles.  The work of
trying to knit all of those documents together into a single whole has not
yet begun.  If you have bright ideas on how we could proceed on that front,
we would be more than happy to hear them.
<p>
<h4>Stylesheet improvements</h4>
<p>
With the adoption of Sphinx we have much nicer-looking HTML output than we
once did.  But it could still use a lot of improvement; Donald Knuth and
Edward Tufte would be unimpressed.  That requires tweaking our stylesheets
to create more typographically sound, accessible, and readable output.
<p>
Be warned: if you take on this task you are heading into classic bikeshed
territory.  Expect a lot of opinions and discussion for even relatively
obvious changes.  That is, alas, the nature of the world we live in.
<p>
<h4>Non-LaTeX PDF build</h4>

<p>
This is a decidedly nontrivial task for somebody with a lot of time and
Python skills.  The Sphinx toolchain is relatively small and well
contained; it is easy to add to a development system.  But building PDF or
EPUB output requires installing LaTeX, which is anything but small or well
contained.  That would be a nice thing to eliminate.
<p>
The original hope had been to use the <a
href="https://rst2pdf.org/">rst2pdf tool</a> 
for PDF generation, but it turned out to not be up to the task.
Development work on rst2pdf seems to have picked up again in recent times,
though, which is a hopeful sign.  If a suitably motivated developer were to
work with that project to make rst2pdf work with the kernel documentation
build, the world would be eternally grateful.
<p>
<h4>Write more documentation</h4>

<p>
Naturally, there are massive parts of the kernel that are severely
underdocumented.  If you have the knowledge to document a specific kernel
subsystem and the desire to do so, please do not hesitate to do some
writing and contribute the result to the kernel.  Untold numbers of kernel
developers and users will thank you.

Matches my experience trying to document all the things in drivers/gpu. You always end up with a massive patch series to clean up all the big and little warts, plus then often a few new todo entries encouraging people to move over to more modern helper functions. And finally a relatively small patch to document what's left in terms of functions and data structures ....<br>

That's one of the great benefit of documenting an API while designing it instead of after the fact. If you can't explain what the API does in reasonably terse plain English, you probably didn't get the API design right.<br>

Indeed. 18 years ago I started documenting bits of libstdc++:<br>
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=c0d88161574d43250b55dd7687ad062f5f7ca803">https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=c0d8816157...</a><br>

I've now made more than 2500 changes to GCC and I'm still not finished with the docs.<br>

I asked my wife whether the hyphen in "software-development project" was correct. She sighed. The explanation involved the word "morphology", and I stopped listening at that point.<br>

      <blockquote>Even when all documents are in the right place, though, we have only managed to turn a big pile into a group of smaller piles. The work of trying to knit all of those documents together into a single whole has not yet begun. If you have bright ideas on how we could proceed on that front, we would be more than happy to hear them.</blockquote>

I don't have absolutely brilliant ideas on how to connect the items in the pile, unfortunately. But maybe one way to *group* the piles that would be useful is the concepts introduced by Daniele Procida in <a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">what nobody tells you about documentation</a>. The distinction between "tutorials", "howto", "reference" and "discussion" absolutely changed my life and is the basic structure of all documentation I am writing since then. The gist of it is you should split up your docs so that your users don't freak out when they fall into it. Those are the basic sections:

<ul>
<li>tutorial - simple introduction tasks to get started, assumes no technical background
<li>how-to guides - show how to solve specific problems, more complex, can assume some background knowledge and interpretation
<li>reference guides - technical description of how things actually work, API docs go here
<li>discussion or "explanation" - discussion of alternatives, history and context
</ul>

Now, of course, "no technical background" in the Linux kernel has a higher bar than elsewhere: I guess it would be fair to assume people know a bit of C programming, for example. Or that the kernel holds network things into buffers while they go in transit. But maybe not <em>how</em> those network buffers are called in Linux (sbufs? skbufs? mbufs? i always forget)...

This does wonder to not only help newcomers use the documentation, but also for old-timers to not be distracted by the tutorials they don't need...

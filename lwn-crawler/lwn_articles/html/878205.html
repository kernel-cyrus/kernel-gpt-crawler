           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 13, 2021</br>
           </div>
Email is often seen as a technology with a dim future; it is slow, easily
faked, and buried in spam.  Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and
email has lost its charm with many others as well.
But many development projects are still dependent on it, and even
non-developers still cope with large volumes of mail.  While development
forges show one possible path away from email, they are not the only one.
What if new structures could be built on top of email to address some of
its worst problems while keeping the good parts that many projects depend
on?  The "lei" system recently launched by Konstantin Ryabitsev is a hint
of how such a future might look.
<p>
One of the initial motivations for creating LWN, back in 1997, was to spare
readers from the impossible task of keeping up with the linux-kernel
mailing list.  After all, that list was receiving an astounding 100
messages every day, and no rational human being would try to read such a
thing.  Some 24 years later, that situation has changed: linux-kernel now
runs over 1,000 messages per day, and there are dozens of other busy,
kernel-oriented mailing lists as well.  It is easy to miss important
messages while trying to follow that kind of traffic — and few developers
even try.
<p>
While much of the traffic that appears on any mailing list is quickly
forgettable, some of it has lasting value; that means that good
archives are needed.  For most of the kernel project's history, those
archives did not exist.  There were indeed archives for most lists, but
they were scattered, of mixed reliability, difficult to search, and usually
incomplete.  It 
is only a few years ago that Ryabitsev put together <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org">lore.kernel.org</a> to serve as a better
solution to this problem.  By using a search-friendly archiving system (<a
href="/Articles/748184/">public-inbox</a>), building complete archives from
pieces obtained from numerous sources, and archiving most kernel-oriented
lists, Ryabitsev was able to create a resource that quickly became
indispensable within the community.
<p>
Lei (which stands for "local email interface") comes out of the
public-inbox community.  It works nicely with lore, to
the point that Ryabitsev refers to the whole system as "lore+lei".  The
idea behind this combination is to create a new way of dealing with email
that allows developers to see interesting messages without having to
subscribe to an entire list.
<p>
Public-inbox is built on some interesting ideas, including the use of Git
to store the archive itself.  The real key to its usefulness, though, is
the use of <a href="https://xapian.org/">Xapian</a> to implement a fast,
focused search capability.  The "fast" part allows for nearly instantaneous
searches within the millions of messages in the email archive; <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=dromedary">this query</a>, for
example, shows immediately that the term "dromedary" has been used exactly
30 times in all of the lists archived on lore.
<p>
The search mechanism differs from that found in many email clients in that 
it implements search terms that are
useful in the context of a technical mailing 
list.  So, while searching for "dromedary" finds occurrences of that word,
"nq:dromedary", instead, only turns up occurrences that are not in quoted
text being replied to.  That <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=nq%3Adromedary">reduces
the number of hits</a> to&nbsp;13 without missing any of 
the original occurrences of the word.  It is also possible to search for
terms in a number of message headers, the names of files touched by
patches, the names of functions changed by patches, and more; see <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/_/text/help/">this page</a> for details.
<p>
The purpose of lei, in short, is to take advantage of the search features
built into public-inbox to give developers highly filtered views of
mailing-list traffic.  It takes a search query and uses it to populate a
mailbox, which can then be perused with the user's client of choice.  As an
example, take this query, which appeared in <a
href="/ml/workflows/lorelei.part1.202111051304.mdtebsxahljcrxak@meerkat.local/">Ryabitsev's
announcement of lei</a> in November:
<p>
<pre>
    lei q -I https://lore.kernel.org/all/ -o ~/Mail/floppy \
      --threads --dedupe=mid \
      '(dfn:drivers/block/floppy.c OR dfhh:floppy_* OR s:floppy \
      OR ((nq:bug OR nq:regression) AND nq:floppy)) \
      AND rt:1.month.ago..'
</pre>
<p>
The idea here is to obtain all emails that might be relevant to the
maintainer of the kernel's vitally important floppy driver.  It looks for
any of:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> patches that touches <tt>floppy.c</tt>
     (<tt>dfn:drivers/block/floppy.c</tt>)
<li> patches that change a function whose name starts with <tt>floppy_</tt>
     (<tt>dfhh:floppy_*</tt>)
<li> messages with "floppy" in the subject (<tt>s:floppy</tt>)
<li> messages that mention both "floppy" and either "bug" or "regression" in
     non-quoted text (<tt>(nq:bug OR nq:regression) AND nq:floppy</tt>)
</ul>
<p>
The search is limited
to messages sent in the last month.
The <tt>lei</tt> command will go to lore and execute this search on all
mailing lists, 
collect the matched messages, and store them in the maildir folder
<tt>~/Mail/floppy</tt>.  They can then use whichever tools are best for
working with the messages in that folder.
<p>
Lei will remember this search, so updating the folder with new messages at
a later time is a matter of a simple "<tt>lei&nbsp;up</tt>" command.  As
described in <a
href="/ml/workflows/lorelei.part2.202111121411.sznnvkvcywfbdghl@meerkat.local/">this
followup post</a>, it is also possible to instruct lei to store the
retrieved messages in a remote IMAP folder rather than a local maildir
folder.
<p>
The intent behind this work is clear: it lets kernel developers keep up
with email traffic that is of interest to them without the need to
subscribe to a set of high-volume mailing lists.  No developer can
subscribe to all lists where relevant messages might appear; with lore+lei,
they no longer have to even try.  It may also make email more
reliable for many users.  There is, for example, an ongoing low rumble of
complaints regarding problems getting email from kernel lists delivered to
Gmail users; use of lore+lei can route around such problems entirely.
<p>
In one sense, lei follows the pattern we have seen in other parts of the
Internet.  Those of us who watched the World Wide Web develop all those
years ago will remember the extensive efforts that went into trying to
index the 
whole thing.  Yahoo got started as a hierarchical directory of the web, for
example.  After a while it became clear that such efforts were hopeless and
that search was the right tool for the job of finding things on the net.
Lei is a statement that the same is true for email conversations;
organizing our discussions into a set of topic-focused lists has gotten us
far, but this approach is clearly under strain now.
<p>
Maybe, the reasoning goes, it's time to forget about all those lists and
just use searches instead.  As a step in that direction, Ryabitsev has
created <a
href="/ml/workflows/20211129215634.gydsyfyhu6rhbbe2@meerkat.local/">a
mailing list for patches</a> — all patches, regardless of which subsystem
they affect.  Developers are encouraged to copy their patch postings to
this list.  Anybody who is interested in specific patches can use tools
like Lei to filter out the rest.
<p>
What is potentially being lost here, of course, is the serendipity of
finding interesting emails that one might never think to search for.  If
lei serves to further isolate kernel developers into their own niches, there
could be an adverse effect on kernel development as a whole.
Cross-subsystem discussions could become harder, and developers could lose
awareness of what is happening elsewhere in the project.  Filter bubbles
are already a problem in the wider world; they could make it harder to
maintain the cohesiveness of a large free-software project as well.
<p>
Then again, such
a world sounds like fertile ground for news sites providing a broad view of
what's happening in the community, so perhaps it's not an entirely bad
thing.
<p>
Finally, there is one other aspect of this work that is worth thinking
about.  The functionality implemented in lore+lei is highly useful in its
own right, but one could also argue that it's really just the database
layer that will sit underneath a new generation of
collaborative-development tools.  The fact that those tools don't exist yet
is inconvenient, but hopefully there are developers out there who are
starting to think about how to fill that void.  That would, in the end,
finally provide a path for email-dependent free-software communities to, at
least on the surface 
of things, move away from email and onto something better.  The email-based
infrastructure underlying it all could become an implementation detail that
users need not worry about if it does not interest them.  That could be a
future worth working toward.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      You'd think that, after all these years of watching the public-inbox list, I would have had a better handle on that.  Sorry Eric and company!  I'll find a way to work that in.

What about people who AVOID social networks because they see this as a PROBLEM, not a solution.<br>
<p>
What about uber-developers where you are not interested in 99% of what they&#x27;re doing?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; &gt; Maybe we could lead a page from &quot;modern&quot; social networks. After all, developers are a social network, too. Imagine receiving an stream of messages/patches from the developers you are subscribed to, and resending to your subscribers those that you find interesting/relevant...</font><br>
<p>
+1, I&#x27;ve always hated this &quot;IN or OUT&quot; binary aspect of mailing list subscriptions. Memories of middle school and exclusive groups of &quot;cool kids&quot; :-)<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; What about people who AVOID social networks because they see this as a PROBLEM, not a solution.</font><br>
<p>
Whether it&#x27;s coffee machines, Twitter, LWN comments, conferences, WhatsApp groups, dinner parties or direct messaging, &quot;social networks&quot; in a very broad sense have always and will always provide plenty enough of the &quot;serendipity&quot; mentioned in the article. Humans are extremely social animals.<br>
<p>
Granted, the algorithms of some (a?)social networks are tuned to make money out of confirmation bias and irrational response but let&#x27;s not throw the baby with the bathwater. Like so many others before it, &quot;modern&quot; social network technology is neither good or bad, it&#x27;s what we make of it and in this case especially how we _pay_ for it. Funding it with our attention and brain time: now that is the bad idea.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Then again, such a world sounds like fertile ground for news sites providing a broad view of what&#x27;s happening in the community, so perhaps it&#x27;s not an entirely bad thing.</font><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>

<p>
A &quot;stream&quot; is in fact what our inboxes have already become a long time ago: a lossy medium EVEN for people not subscribing to mailing lists much. This happens because anyone can dump anything on anyone else&#x27;s TODO list without needing any sort of permission. &quot;Spam&quot; is not just what people think, there are more subtle forms. I&#x27;m sure it was fine when the Internet was created and everyone knew each other. Not that great in today&#x27;s information overload era and basically why:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and email has lost its charm with many others as well.</font><br>
<p>
Where is the big &quot;unsubscribe&quot; button? To be in control again.<br>

The b4 script is really nice.<br>
<p>
Eventually all patches will have a lore link to the discussion and that will help me know if the static checker warnings have already been addressed or not so I don&#x27;t duplicate reports.  I guess I could search for the Fixes: hash instead.<br>
<p>
Another thing that I&#x27;d like is if we could use lore to automatically create TODO lists.  It&#x27;s like your &quot;dromedary&quot; search but the results show a line of context as well as the link to the email.  So if you are reviewing someone&#x27;s patch and you think of an idea then you just add a line to your reply: &quot;TODO: subsystem/prefix: clean up leaks in foo_bar()&quot;.  Then if you need ideas, search for TODO and that line would show up in the search results.  People could click on the link and read the email for the full explanation.<br>

Hopefully because this is not quite there yet:<br>

I&#x27;m not saying there is something wrong with this search syntax, I mean it shouldn&#x27;t be required for a quick search before making a drive-by documentation or small bug fix.<br>
<p>
But I&#x27;m not optimistic because <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878263">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html...</a><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where you see a choice between complexity in data structures and complexity in code, choose the former.</font><br>

Whether email-based development infrastructure has a bright future or not, these tools seem extremely useful today.<br>

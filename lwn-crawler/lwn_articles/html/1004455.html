<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 14, 2025</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>
system call allows a suitably privileged process to modify another in a
large number of ways.  Among other things, <tt>ptrace()</tt> can intercept
system calls and make changes to them, but such operations can be fiddly
and architecture-dependent.  <a
href="/ml/all/20250107230153.GA30560@strace.io">This patch series from
Dmitry Levin</a> seeks to improve that situation by adding a new
<tt>ptrace()</tt> operation to make changes to another process's system
calls in an architecture-independent manner.
<p>
<tt>ptrace()</tt> has, since the 5.3 release in 2019, supported an
operation, <tt>PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO</tt>, that can be used when the
traced process has been stopped at a system call.  It is used by, for
example, the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html"><tt>strace</tt></a>
utility to obtain information about the system calls made by a process of
interest.  The addition of this operation made life easier for programs
like <tt>strace</tt> which, previously, had needed special code to handle
the unique way in which each architecture manages system-call arguments and
return values.  Now, the same <tt>ptrace()</tt> call works on all
architectures supported by Linux.
<p>
System calls can be intercepted — and information gathered — at three
different points: on system-call entry, on the return to user space after
the system call completes, or when a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
trace rule is executed.  The information available at each point varies; on
entry, for example, the system-call number and arguments are available.  On
exit, instead, <tt>PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO</tt> will provide the return
value from the executed system call.  This information comes back in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12.6/source/include/uapi/linux/ptrace.h#L82"><tt>ptrace_syscall_info</tt></a>
structure; the <tt>ptrace()</tt> manual page describes each of the returned
fields.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
While <tt>ptrace()</tt> can be used to obtain system-call information,
there is no equivalent way to change that information in an
architecture-independent way.  Any process that wants to mess with another
process's interactions with the kernel must, thus, resort to lower-level
means.  Levin suggests that things should have been done differently:
"<q>Ideally, PTRACE_SET_SYSCALL_INFO should have been introduced along with
PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO, but it didn't happen</q>".  Even in our less-than-ideal
reality, though, that capability can be added now.
<p>
Within the kernel, there exists a function to change a process's
system-call arguments in an architecture-independent way.  Or, at least,
there once was.  Roland McGrath <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/828c365cc8b8">added
<tt>syscall_set_arguments()</tt></a> to the 2.6.27 kernel in 2008, but that
function never acquired any users, so Peter Collingbourne <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7962c2eddbfe7">duly removed it</a>
during the 5.16 development cycle in 2021.  Levin starts by reverting that
patch — partially, at least.  The implementation of
<tt>syscall_set_arguments()</tt> on some architectures was evidently buggy
enough that it was better to just provide new versions outright.
<p>
Levin also adds an internal <tt>syscall_set_nr()</tt> function to set the
requested system-call number in an architecture-independent way; as can be
seen from <a href="/ml/all/20250107230438.GC30633@strace.io">the patch
adding this function</a>, that operation must be done differently for each
architecture.  Of course, the level of architecture-independence achieved
here is relative, since the system-call numbers themselves can vary from
one architecture to the next.
<p>
With that infrastructure in place, adding <tt>PTRACE_SET_SYSCALL_INFO</tt>
to <tt>ptrace()</tt> is a relatively straightforward task.  At system-call
entry, this call can change both the system-call number and the arguments
provided, possibly yielding a result that is rather different from what the
calling process intended.  The system-call number can also be set to
<tt>-1</tt>, which will result in the call being skipped altogether and the
<tt>errno</tt> value being set to <tt>ENOSYS</tt>.  The same changes can be
made for system calls intercepted by <tt>seccomp()</tt>.  At system-call
exit, instead, only the system call's return value can be changed.
<p>
The other values found in the <tt>ptrace_syscall_info</tt> structure,
including the instruction and stack pointers, cannot be modified with the
new operation.  That could possibly change in the future, Levin said in the
cover letter, should there be a need to modify those values.  There is a
set of three padding bytes in the structure that must be set to zero in the
current version of the patch; future versions could look there for flags
indicating other changes to be made.  The size of this structure is passed
in from user space, meaning that it could be expanded in a compatible
manner if the desire to change even more system-call-related parameters
were to arise.
<p>
For now, though, the patch set is limited to the basic operations described
above.  One thing that is missing from the submission is a description of
how this new feature might be used.  One can imagine various types of
sandboxing solutions that, among other things, limit the system calls a
process can make, with the ability to make changes (or even emulate system
calls) as needed; enhancements to <tt>seccomp()</tt> <a
href="/Articles/899281/">have been targeted at this sort of use case</a> in
the past.  The development community may want to see more information about
the intended uses this time around, but any sort of concerted opposition to
this functionality would be surprising.  In the end, it does not allow
anything that <tt>ptrace()</tt> cannot already do.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thus one could implement what is effectively a hypervisor in userspace!  because . . . I can't think of any motivation.<br>

It makes it much more convenient to implement a userspace hypervisor, for sure.<br>

For the emulation/translation space, you'd be better off using SUD if you care about performance.  This is bound to be significantly slower.<br>

Bonus: SUD doesn't require raised permissions.<br>

However, it's a nice extension and something that should already exist for sure.<br>

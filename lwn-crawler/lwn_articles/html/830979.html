<h1>Android kernel notes from LPC 2020</h1>

<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2020-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
In its early days, the Android project experienced a high-profile
disconnect with the kernel community.  That situation has since improved
considerably, but there are still
differences between Android kernels and the mainline.  As a result, it is
not possible to run Android on a vanilla kernel.  That situation continues
to improve, though; much evidence to that effect was on display during the
Android microconference at the 2020 <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>.
Several sessions there showed the progress that is being made toward
unifying the Android and mainline kernels — and the places where there is
still some work to be done.
<p>
<h4>The generic kernel image</h4>
<p>
Todd Kjos started things off by introducing the Android Generic Kernel
Image (GKI) effort, which is aimed at reducing Android's
kernel-fragmentation problem in general.  It is the next step for the
Android Common Kernel, which
is based on the mainline long-term support (LTS) releases with a number of
patches added on top.  These patches vary from Android-specific, out-of-tree
features to fixes cherry-picked from mainline releases.  The end result is
that the Android Common Kernel diverges somewhat from the LTS releases on
which it is based. 
<p>
From there, things get worse.  Vendors pick up this kernel and apply their
own changes — often significant, core-kernel changes — to create a vendor
kernel.  The original-equipment manufacturers begin with that kernel when

<a href="/Articles/830981/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/lpc/ToddKjos-sm.png" alt="[Todd Kjos]"
title="Todd Kjos" class="rthumb"></a>

creating a device based on the vendor's chips, but then add changes of
their own to create the OEM kernel that is shipped with a device to the
consumer.  The end result of all this patching is that every device has its
own kernel, meaning that there are thousands of different "Android" kernels
in use.

</blockquote>
<p>
There are a lot of costs to this arrangement, Kjos said.  Fragmentation
makes it harder to ensure that all devices are running current kernels — or
even that they get security updates.  New platform releases require a new
kernel, which raises the cost of upgrading an existing device to a new
Android version.  Fixes applied by vendors and OEMs often do not make it
back into the mainline, making things worse for everybody.
<p>
The Android developers would like to fix this fragmentation problem; the
path toward that goal involves
providing a single generic kernel in binary form (the GKI) that all devices
would use.  Any 
vendor-specific or device-specific code that is not in the mainline kernel
will need to be shipped in the form of kernel modules to be loaded into the
GKI.  That means
that Android is explicitly encouraging vendor modules, Kjos said; the
result is a cleaner kernel without the sorts of core-kernel modifications
that ship on many devices now.
<p>
This policy has already resulted in more vendors actively working to
upstream their code.  That code often does not take the form that
mainline developers would like to see; some of it is just patches exporting
symbols.  That has created some tension in the development community, he
said.
<p>
He concluded by saying that the Android 11 release requires all devices to
ship with kernels based on the Android Common Kernel; Android&nbsp;12 will
require shipping 
with the GKI instead.  Tim Bird asked how vendors plan to cope when a patch
they need isn't integrated into the mainline or the Android Common Kernel;
Kjos answered that the 
current plan is to add vendor hooks via tracepoints.  The details, though,
have not yet been worked out.
<p>
<h4>ABI enforcement</h4>
<p>
Later, Matthias Männich talked about GKI ABI enforcement, the purpose of
which is to ensure a stable ABI for modules so that GKI updates do not end
up breaking devices in the field.  This is not a simple task;
the kernel ABI is large, and it is hard to catch changes in every part of
it.  He emphasized that this work is in no way trying to stabilize the

<a href="/Articles/830982/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/lpc/MatthiasMannich-sm.png" alt="[Matthias Männich]"
title="Matthias Männich" class="rthumb"></a>

<i>mainline</i> kernel ABI, or even the ABI for LTS kernels.  It is
only intended to keep the kernel ABI stable within a specific Android
version.
<p>
While ABI changes are not welcome in GKI updates, configuration changes are
allowed as long as they don't change the interface as seen by modules.  The
kernel and modules are all built with a single toolchain using a "hermetic
build" process wherein all needed libraries are provided independently of
the system the kernel is built on.  Compiler updates are carefully examined
to ensure that they will not result in any ABI changes; Android would rather
not upgrade than risk problems, he said.
<p>
Within the ABI itself, the goal is to keep everything that is observable
stable.  That task is obviously easier if the set of observable aspects is
minimized; <a href="/Articles/760045/">kernel symbol namespaces</a> help in
that regard.  They also help to prevent kernel symbols from being used
accidentally.  The kernel-module interface is established by looking at the
symbols that are actually used by vendor modules; those naturally have to
be exported.  Everything that turns out not to be used is trimmed from the
GKI, though, 
making it unavailable.  When a vendor needs a new symbol, a request is made
to the Android Open Source Project; assuming the request makes sense, the
symbol will appear in a subsequent GKI update.

<p>
<h4>Android on mainline</h4>
<p>
Sumit Semwal talked for a while about what it takes to boot Android on a
mainline kernel.  It turns out that, in the generic case, there is only one
patch needed at this point: <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200901091901.19779-1-sumit.semwal@linaro.org/">anonymous
VMA naming</a>.

The Android kernel also requires <a
href="/Articles/717754/">inline encryption</a>, but that has been merged
for the 5.9 release.
<p>
The situation gets more complicated on real hardware, of course.  For
devices using the Snapdragon 845 system-on-chip, a number of out-of-tree
drivers are required.  One of them, the lt9611 HDMI bridge driver used on
Pixel&nbsp;3 devices, has been queued for the 5.10 merge window.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Pocophone_F1">Xiaomi
Pocophone F1</a> can run on the 5.9-rc1 kernel with just a few patches 
for the touchscreen, WiFi, and audio devices.
<p>
Android may, in theory, be able to boot with a single patch to the mainline
kernel, but the project is still carrying 485 patches on top of the 5.9-rc
kernel, he said.  About 30 of those are currently being discussed for
merging; 78 of them are intended to be upstreamed.  Another 25 are being
worked on by Linaro with the intent of getting them upstream.  There are 54
patches that will eventually be replaced by alternatives; these include the
<a href="/Articles/480055/">ION memory allocator</a>.  That leaves 260
patches currently not on a path for upstreaming; many of them have to do
with the GKI build or configuration changes.  There are ten patches that
could be considered for upstream, but they need an upstream user as well.
<p>
The most active discussions around upstreaming currently focus on features
like inline encryption (now merged) and the incremental filesystem
(discussed further below).  Anonymous VMA naming was first <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1383170047-21074-2-git-send-email-ccross@android.com/">posted
by Colin Cross</a> in 2013, but has yet to be merged; a new effort to merge
that work is underway now.  <a href="/Articles/792733/">DMA-buf heaps</a>
are moving forward as a replacement for ION.
<p>
Work that is not yet going upstream includes DRM notifiers, which lack an
in-kernel user and thus will not be considered for merging; that patch is
not being posted currently.  More DMA-buf heap providers will be needed to
fully replace ION.  These, too, lack in-kernel users; changing that will
require vendors to upstream their drivers that need those features.
<p>
<h4>Incremental filesystem</h4>
<p>

<a href="/Articles/830984/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/lpc/PaulLawrence-sm.png" alt="[Paul Lawrence]"
title="Paul Lawrence" class="rthumb"></a>

One significant Android feature that has not yet seen much discussion in
the mainline is the incremental filesystem; Paul Lawrence ran a brief
session dedicated to this work.  The goal behind the incremental
filesystem is to allow the launch of a newly downloaded app to happen
immediately, even if the process of downloading the app to the device has
not yet completed.  To make that happen, files that are being downloaded
are made to appear as if they were already present on the device.
Reads from such a file will succeed if the
relevant blocks are present; otherwise the app will have to wait until
those blocks show up.
<p>
Files on an incremental filesystem are read-only, but the filesystem itself
is not.  A file's blocks can be delivered out of order, and the filesystem
will keep track of things accordingly.  It is implemented as a stacking
filesystem, meaning that there is a "real" filesystem underneath where the
files are ultimately stored.  Most directory operations are passed through
directly to the underlying filesystem, while reads require interpreting the
file and returning the expected data (once it is available).  Writes (only
allowed when the file 
is being created) are done via a special <tt>ioctl()</tt> call.
<p>
This work was first <a href="/Articles/787606/">posted to the lists</a> in
2019, but it has not yet received much serious consideration.  Expect new
versions in the near future as the Android project works to get this
feature into the mainline kernel.

I think they&#x27;d have a hard time arguing (with a straight face) that their Android-specific kernel modifications weren&#x27;t somehow derivative of the kernel itself… How often do these components have existing support in other OS deployments that can be claimed to have been &quot;just a port&quot; (akin to nvidia&#x27;s driver argument)?<br>

On the other hand, it&#x27;s an ABI, so at least it can be instrumented to discover what the module in question is doing with the rest of the kernel. We might even be able to sandbox them. That alone is a huge improvement WRT the current state of affairs.<br>

How do you plan to sandbox Linux drivers? They access core kernel memory from everywhere, and thus normal hardware-based memory separation / address-spaces, afaict, cannot work.<br>

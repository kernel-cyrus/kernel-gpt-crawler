<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">LSFMM 2015</a>
</div>
Dave Hansen started a brief LSFMM 2015 memory-management
track session on page-reclaim performance by saying that we have a problem:
over the years, the kernel's 
memory-management and swap subsystems have been designed around the use of
slow secondary storage devices.  But now we are heading toward an era
increasingly driven by the availability of massive nonvolatile memory, and
we are not fully prepared for it.
<p>
The fundamental question, he said, was how to integrate these technologies
into the Linux kernel.  We have a number of subsystems like <a
href="/Articles/636096/">DAX</a> that can provide high-speed access to
persistent memory devices, but they require applications to be changed.  If
we run current kernels over such devices without using special interfaces,
swapping is no faster than it is with older, slower devices.  There is just
too much overhead in the memory-management layer, and, in particular, in
the manipulation of the least-recently-used (LRU) lists that track
reclaimable pages in the system.  The LRU, he said, is a fancy system to
find the best eviction candidate at any given time, but, in this situation,
perhaps it would be better to use something else?
<p>
Christoph Lameter suggested that users who care about performance should
just put their entire application into memory and be done with it.  But
Dave was not so easily deterred; he would like to find ways for existing
applications to get better performance on persistent-memory devices without
changes.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli said that we should not be worrying about memory in 4KB
units when we are dealing with devices that can hold 100GB or more.
Swapping pages in 2MB units would, he said, go a long way toward solving
the problem.  Andi Kleen agreed to a point â€” but he felt that 2MB was still
far too small.  In general, he said, we need to move toward managing memory
in larger chunks or just do away with the LRU lists altogether.
<p>
Dave suggested that there are a number of opportunities to run the LRU
lists in a more relaxed mode.  One idea, he said, was to add a third LRU
level for pages that are ready to be swapped out.  (The kernel currently
manages two levels of LRU lists, one for active pages and one for pages that
seem to be inactive and should be considered for eviction).  Perhaps some
sort of "scanaround" algorithm could be applied to that third level to
batch up pages for writing out to the swap device.  Johannes Weiner
answered that he had tried something similar a few years ago.  It didn't
work well, he said, due to disk seek issues, but it might work better on
truly random-access devices.
<p>
Hugh Dickins expressed skepticism toward the entire idea, though.  To him,
it looks like an attempt to reduce memory-management overhead by adding
even more complex algorithms to cluster things.  That is increasing the
complexity of the system rather than reducing it.  Batching things up may
help to speed things up, but you still have to deal with items individually
to make up the batches.
<p>
As things wound down, Dave said that he was going away with a couple of
interesting ideas to explore.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           </div>
As of this writing, some 6,144 non-merge changesets have been pulled into
the mainline repository for the 3.17 development cycle.  The merge window,
in other words, has just begun.  Even so, a number of interesting features
and internal changes have found their way in.  Some of the more interesting
user-visible changes include:
<p>
<ul>  

<li> The <tt>perf</tt> tool can now perform page fault tracing and generate 
     associated statistics.  Additionally, "<tt>perf timechart</tt>" can
     generate charts displaying I/O events.
<p>
<li> Four-level page tables have been added to the arm64 architecture,
     greatly expanding the amount of virtual memory that can be addressed.
     This feature will likely not be enabled in 3.17 kernels, though, due
     to the need for more work.    The arm64 architecture has also gained
     audit support.
<p>
<li> The cryptographic subsystem has gained support for the NIST-specified 
     SP800-90A deterministic random bit generator.  There is also support
     for parsing PKCS#7 signed-data messages and verifying the signatures.
<p>
<li> The netfilter "ulog" target, long deprecated, has finally been
     removed.  The "NFLOG" target should be used instead.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/600250/">Cross-thread filter setting</a> for the
     secure computing ("seccomp") facility has been added.  The interface
     has changed over time, though; there is now a new system call for
     seccomp:
     <p>
     <pre>
    int seccomp(unsigned int operation, unsigned int flag, const char *args);
</pre>
     <a href="/Articles/603321/">This man page</a> describes the new system
     call and the available commands.
<p>

<li> The security module subsystem has gained a new hook
     (<tt>kernel_fw_from_file()</tt>) that may be used to verify the
     integrity of firmware blobs before accepting them in the kernel. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/606141/"><tt>getrandom()</tt></a> system call
     has been merged.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>

     </ul>
     <p>

     It's worth noting that 14 unloved drivers were removed from the
     staging tree, eliminating some 250,000 lines of code.  Indeed, as of
     this writing, 3.17 is actually smaller than 3.16.  A kernel release
     has been smaller than its predecessor only one other time
     in kernel development history (2.6.36).

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A number of changes have been made to the timekeeping core in order
     to make it ready for the year 2038; see <a
     href="/Articles/607741/">this article</a> for details.
<p>
<li> The dma-buf fence API has been added.
     This subsystem enables cross-device synchronization and coordination,
     especially around the use of DMA buffers.  In the end, this API was
     made available to all kernel modules; <a href="/Articles/603131/">a
     push to change it to the 
     <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()</tt> mechanism</a> was not successful.
<p>
<li> The "config-bisect" mode in the <tt>ktest</tt> utility has been
     reworked to be much smarter about finding the actual configuration
     change that causes problems.
<p>
<li> The ftrace subsystem has been reworked to make things more efficient
     when multiple tracers are active, and, in particular, when function
     graph tracing is being performed.
<p>
<li> Arm64 kernels can now be built with the <tt>-fstack-protector</tt>
     option to detect stack corruption.
<p>
<li> The <tt>wait_on_bit()</tt> function (along with its variants) has been
     reworked to no longer require an "action" function since, as it
     turned out, most of those functions were duplicates of each other.
</ul>
<p>

In the <a href="/Articles/607527/">3.16 announcement</a>, Linus noted that
he will be traveling during the latter part of the 3.17 merge window.  That
may, he said, cause this merge window to be a little longer than usual.
Subsystem maintainers would be wise to not count on that when sending their
pull requests, though.  It seems likely that Linus will feel motivated to
close the merge window and get the 3.17-rc1 release out before the Kernel
Summit starts on August&nbsp;18.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Hehe, I had to think about that one for a moment.  Seems I have difficulty recognizing 3 ✕ 2<sup>n</sup>. (Perhaps that's why I was hell-bent on buying a new laptop with 8GB of RAM instead of 6GB.) :-)</p>

<p>P.S. (and going off on a tangent): Anyone remember Bill Gates' <i>non</i>-quote &quot;<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9101699/The_640K_quote_won_t_go_away_but_did_Gates_really_say_it_">640K ought to be enough for anybody</a>&quot;? That's 5 ✕ 2<sup>n</sup> (for n = 17).  A PC with five SIMM slots (or whatever the onboard memory expansion slots were called back then) would be interesting...</p>

<P>IIRC, on the PC XT, it was actually 4 rows of 9 DIPs (36 discrete chips, including parity).  2 rows of 256Kx1 chips, and 2 rows of 64Kx1 chips, as I recall.  Some were socketed and some were soldered in.</P>
<P>Why not three rows of 256Kx1?  Not sure.  If I had to venture a guess, it was probably due to the memory map they established with the original IBM PC.  The MDA and CGA adaptors started at<TT> B:0000 </TT>and<TT> B:8000</TT>, which prevents you from going to 768K of contiguous memory without moving them and breaking compatibility with the original 5150.  Given that the 5150 came with only 16K or 64K of RAM originally, I guess it wasn't a pressing concern at the time?</P>
<P>I don't miss the 640K era.</P>

<p>
exactly, it wasn't until the memory got cheap enough in larger sizes that manufacturers started installing 1M of RAM on the boards even though the system could only use 640K (because it was cheaper for them to do so then to deal with two sizes of chips) that high memory was born.<br>
<p>
and when the XT was shipped (at a price of ~$5K IIRC with two floppies and 16K of RAM, imagining that 640K would be limiting was hard.<br>

I don't miss those days either.<br>

Not really. SP800-90A defines 4 different random number generators, only one of them is the backdoored one. The other 3 have been implemented in Linux.<br>
<p>
See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=541af946fe1360ec1b45730964e87d7f93c50781">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/lin...</a><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; All three viable DRBGs defined in the standard are implemented:</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  * HMAC: This is the leanest DRBG and compiled per default</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  * Hash: The more complex DRBG can be enabled at compile time</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  * CTR: The most complex DRBG can also be enabled at compile time</font><br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The dma-buf fence API has been added. This subsystem enables cross-device synchronization and coordination, especially around the use of DMA buffers. In the end, this API was made available to all kernel modules; a push to change it to the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() mechanism was not successful. </font><br>

Hooray!<br>

Hopefully the people pushing for that have seen sense ... (because, as was pointed out in an lwn article, it would have gutted all meaning from EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL).<br>
<p>
Because, at the end of the day, that fuss was all about peoples A telling peoples B how peoples B should licence their own code. And in the Open/Free Source communities, we just don't do that ...<br>
<p>
If I want my code to be freely available and I have no intention whatsoever of suing over it, then it's damn stupid for my interface to be exported EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL (because nobody else can sue over it, and I'm not going to ...)<br>

Well, yeah. The GPL is fundamentally about telling people how to license their own code. That's kind of the point. And merely because your particular code happens to specify EXPORT_SYMBOL() instead of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), that's irrelevant - the question is whether something using that symbol is a derivative work of the *work as a whole* or not, and if it is then other copyright holders have the right to sue as well.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  then other copyright holders have the right to sue as well.</font><br>
<p>
But they would be suing over THEIR work.<br>
<p>
If my primary licence is BSD, then I can put my code in the kernel because it's GPL-compatible.<br>
<p>
But it's damn stupid me marking MY modules as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL because I can't sue because it's BSD.<br>
<p>
If someone else wants to licence and mark their code EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL then good luck to them. That's their choice, just don't expect me to take that attitude over mine.<br>

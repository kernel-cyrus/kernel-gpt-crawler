As of this writing, almost 5,400 non-merge changesets have been pulled into
the mainline repository for the 3.1 development cycle.  It's a wide-ranging
set of changes, but many of them are cleanups - almost 600 of those changes
have the word "remove" in the title, and the total growth of the kernel is
less than 5,000 lines.  A number of trees remain unpulled, though, so there
is plenty of scope for the kernel to grow yet.
<p>
User-visible changes merged for 3.1 include:
<ul>

<li> Xen has gained a couple of new guest memory management techniques 
     called "self-ballooning" and "frontswap-selfshrinking."  Both use
     transcendent memory to try to improve memory performance and smooth
     out usage spikes.
<p>
<li> The Xen PCI backend driver - allowing the kernel to export PCI devices
     to guests - has been merged.
<p>
<li> The Xen balloon driver now supports memory hotplug.
<p>
<li> There are a number of enhancements to the IPset including a mechanism
     to store network addresses and interface names together as named
     pairs, adjustable timeouts for SET targets, and more.
<p>
<li> The BATMAN-adv protocol (<a href="/Articles/426947/">covered here</a>
     in February) has gained a better roaming mechanism, improved client
     announcement, and some performance improvements.
<p>
<li> The networking layer has a new "fanout" feature; using
     <tt>setsockopt()</tt>, packets captured from an <tt>AF_PACKET</tt>
     socket can be divided among multiple processes.  A number of policies
     describing how packets are "fanned out" are supported.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/437981/">BPF JIT compiler</a> now supports the
     PowerPC architecture.
<p>
<li> The <tt>ptrace()</tt> system call has been augmented with some new
     commands, starting with <tt>PTRACE_SEIZE</tt>, which is like
     <tt>PTRACE_ATTACH</tt> but does not trap the traced process or change
     its signal state.  <tt>PTRACE_INTERRUPT</tt> will stop a traced
     process without creating confusion with signals.
     <tt>PTRACE_LISTEN</tt> allows the traced process to receive certain
     events even though it is in a stopped state.  All of these options are
     considered to be under development; a special
     <tt>PTRACE_SEIZE_DEVEL</tt> flag must be provided by user space to
     acknowledge an understanding that things might change.
<p>
<li> The <tt>lseek()</tt> system call now implements <a
     href="/Articles/440255/"><tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> and
     <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt></a>; these operations can be used to locate
     extended blocks of zeroes within files.
<p>
<li> Architecture support for the <a href="http://openrisc.net/">OpenRISC
     CPU</a> has been added.
<p>
<li> A number of writeback-improvement changes have gone in, including
     dynamic estimation of backing store bandwidth and a determined attempt
     to make use of most of that bandwidth.
<p>
<li> The iwlagn driver now has WoWLAN (wakeup on wireless LAN) support.

<p>
<li> New drivers:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Processors and systems</b>: 
     	  CSR SiRFSoC PRIMA2 ARM Cortex A9 boards,
	  Xilinx Zynq ARM Cortex A9 boards,
	  Wolfson Cragganmore 6410 CPU modules, and
	  Marvell PXA168 GuruPlug Display (gplugD) boards.
     	  Also, low-level support for the OLPC XO-1 laptop has finally been merged.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Audio</b>:
	  Analog Devices ADAU1701 SigmaDSP codecs,
	  Analog Devices ADAV801 and ADAV803 audio codecs,
	  ST STA32x 2.1-channel digital audio systems,
	  Wolfson WM8983 codecs, and
	  Creative CA0132 codecs.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Block</b>:
     	  Brocade-1860 fabric adapters.

     <p>
     <li> <b>Input</b>:
     	  Speedlink VAD Cezanne mice.

     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  Cirrus Logic EP93xx M2P/M2M DMA controllers,
	  SMSC SCH5636 Super I/O hardware monitor chips,
	  AMS369FG06 AMOLED LCD controllers,
	  FSA9480 micro USB switches,
	  Microwire 93XX46 EEPROM controllers,
	  Qualcomm PMIC8XXX realtime clock modules,
	  Analog Devices AD5686R/AD5685R/AD5684R digital to analog
     converters, and
	  Analog Devices AD7792 and AD7793 analog to digital converters.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Network</b>:
     	  Low-level CAIF-over-HSI network devices,
	  Faraday FTGMAC100 Gigabit Ethernet adapters, and
	  NXP PN533 near-field communication adapters.
     <p>
     <li> <b>USB</b>: PLX NET2272 controllers.

     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A general-purpose CRC8 generation library has been added.
<p>
<li> The networking layer has gained generic support for near-field 
     communication (NFC) devices.  See <a
     href="/Articles/452753/">Documentation/networking/nfc.txt</a> for
     details. 
<p>

<li> The power management callbacks found in <tt>struct dev_pm_ops</tt>
     have been augmented with a whole set of "noirq" versions.  The power
     domains subsystem uses these callbacks for system-wide power
     transitions. 
<p>
<li> The cleanup of the ARM tree continues, with a lot of code duplication
     resolved and the removal of some unused machine types.
<p>
<li> The <tt>check_acl()</tt> inode operation has been replaced by
     <tt>get_acl()</tt>, whose job is to simply fetch the access control
     list from disk. Actual checking of ACLs is now done in the core VFS
     code. 
<p>
<li> The checkpatch.pl script has a new <tt>--ignore</tt> option to turn
     off various types of messages.
</ul>
<p>

It is not clear when this merge window will close; Linus is about to go on
vacation, and, as he has noted, connectivity tends to be poor when one is
under water in scuba gear.  If he is unable to get everything merged
while he is traveling, the merge window may be extended a little past the
normal two weeks.  Or he could decide he has pulled enough and close things
early.  Stay tuned for an update next week.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; subsystem uses these callbacks for system-wide power transitions.</font><br>
<p>
To be precise, what happened was that generic implementations of the<br>
"noirq" callbacks were introduced and added to generic_subsys_pm_ops.<br>
The "noirq" callback pointers have always been there in struct dev_pm_ops.<br>
<p>
More importantly, however, a new framework for representing and handling<br>
generic power management domains have been added (the headers are located<br>
in include/linux/pm_domain.h and the code is in driver/base/power/domain.c).<br>
It does use the new generic "noirq" routines, but that's not the most<br>
important part of it. :-)<br>

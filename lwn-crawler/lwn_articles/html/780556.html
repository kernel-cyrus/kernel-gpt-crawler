<p>
The venerable <tt>printk()</tt> function has been part of Linux since the very
beginning, though it has undergone a fair number of changes along the way.
Now, John Ogness is proposing to fundamentally rework <tt>printk()</tt> in
order to get 
rid of handful of issues that currently plague it.  The proposed code does this
by adding  
yet another ring-buffer implementation to the kernel; this one is aimed at
making <tt>printk()</tt> work better from hard-to-handle contexts.  For
a task that seems conceptually simple—printing messages to the
console—<tt>printk()</tt> is actually a rather complex beast; that won't
change if these patches 
are merged, though many of the problems with the current implementation
will be removed.
</p>

<p>
In the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190212143003.48446-1-john.ogness@linutronix.de/">cover
letter</a> of his RFC patch set, Ogness lays out seven problems that he sees
with the current <tt>printk()</tt> 
implementation.  The buffer used by <tt>printk()</tt> is protected by a raw spinlock,
which restricts the contexts from which the buffer can be accessed.
Calling <tt>printk()</tt> from a non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
or a recursive context, where something called from <tt>printk()</tt> also
calls <tt>printk()</tt>, 
currently means that the logging of the message is deferred, which could
cause the message to be lost. Printing to slow consoles can result in large
latencies, a <tt>printk()</tt> call may end up taking unbounded time while other deferred
messages are printed ahead of the one the caller actually wanted to print.   
</p>

<p>
Two other problems are identified by Ogness.  Timestamps on the messages
are added when a message is added to the buffer but, due to deferrals, that
can happen well after the <tt>printk()</tt> call was made.  While that
behavior has the side 
effect of nicely sorting the messages in terms of time, it is
"<q>neither accurate nor reliable</q>".  In addition, because <tt>printk()</tt>
tries to satisfy all of its users, it ends up compromising too much:
<div class="BigQuote">
Loglevel INFO is handled the same as ERR. There seems to be an
   endless effort to get printk to show _all_ messages as quickly as
   possible in case of a panic (i.e. printing from any context), but
   at the same time try not to have printk be too intrusive for the
   callers. These are conflicting requirements that lead to a printk
   implementation that does a sub-optimal job of satisfying both
   sides.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In order to fix those problems, he is proposing the addition of a
kernel-internal 
<tt>printk()</tt> ring 
buffer that allows for multiple lockless readers; writers use a per-CPU
synchronization mechanism that works in any context.  This
ring-buffer implementation was inspired by a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181017140044.GK3121%40hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">suggestion
from Peter Zijlstra</a>, Ogness said.  The actual writing of the messages
is moved to a dedicated kernel thread, which is preemptible, so the
latencies can be bounded.
The new ring buffer will be allocated in the initialized data segment of
the kernel, so it will be available early in the boot process, even before
the memory-management subsystem is available.  Timestamps
will be generated early in the <tt>printk()</tt> function.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, a new kind of "emergency message" is defined.  Those messages
will appear on certain consoles immediately; no waiting for any other
<tt>printk()</tt> messages that are queued up for the kernel thread.  In order to
participate, consoles will need to implement the new
<tt>write_atomic()</tt> operation.  The patch set includes an <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20190212143003.48446-21-john.ogness@linutronix.de/">implementation
of <tt>write_atomic()</tt> for the 8250 UART driver</a>.  There is a new
kernel configuration parameter, <tt>CONFIG_LOGLEVEL_EMERGENCY</tt>, which
sets the lowest log-level value for emergency messages; it defaults to
<tt>LOG_WARNING</tt>.  That value can also be set by the
"<tt>emergency_loglevel=</tt>" kernel command-line parameter at boot time.
</p>

<p>
So instead of trying to ensure that all messages go out as quickly as
possible, the proposal would effectively partition <tt>printk()</tt>
messages into two 
buckets—at least for consoles that implement <tt>write_atomic()</tt>.
Regular messages will be written out by the kernel thread, which gets
scheduled and preempted normally, so it may not be flushing all of the
messages right 
away.  The messages at the emergency level and above will go out
immediately to an emergency console.  As he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87d0nv248b.fsf@linutronix.de/">noted</a> in the
thread, there are options if losing regular messages in a crash becomes a
problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
As long as all critical messages are print directly and immediately to
an emergency console, why is it is problem if the informational messages
to consoles are sometimes delayed or lost? And if those informational
messages _are_ so important, there are things the user can do. For
example, create a realtime userspace task to read /dev/kmsg.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are some downsides and open issues in the proposal, which Ogness also
lists.  The output from <tt>printk()</tt> has changed somewhat, which may have unforeseen
consequences.  A CPU ID will be printed
as part of emergency messages to help disambiguate multiple simultaneous
messages; those messages are separated from regular <tt>printk()</tt> messages using a
newline character, though there may be an option added to make them stand
out more.  In addition:
<div class="BigQuote">
Be aware that printk output is no longer time-sorted. Actually, it
  never was, but now you see the real timestamps. This seems strange
  at first.
</div>
</p>

<p>
More details on the ring buffer and its API, along with some early
performance numbers, can be seen in a <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190212143003.48446-2-john.ogness@linutronix.de/">patch</a>
adding a file to the <tt>Documentation</tt> directory.</p>

<p>
The reaction to the patch set has been positive overall; there have been
the usual
questions and comments, of course.  <tt>printk()</tt>
has been the 
subject of two relatively recent Kernel Summit sessions (<a
href="/Articles/705938/">in 2016</a> and <a
href="/Articles/737822/">2017</a>); two of those proposing <tt>printk()</tt> changes
at the summits, Sergey Senozhatsky and Petr Mladek, have also commented on
the patches.  Mladek had suggestions for improvements to the
ring-buffer code, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whToBNHN_X_BQkO4zSyhSBaGqTH8XEtxg2_AxoBdDnEdg@mail.gmail.com/">as
did Linus Torvalds</a>.  There have been no major complaints about the
overall goal and plan, however, so it would seem that we could see these
changes go 
into the mainline in a development cycle or two.

Options to make messages stand out more tend to be painful when automatically processing log messages. Kernel programmers are humans and want log output tuned for humans, but many more log readers are scripts using some sort of regular expression.<br>

"Right now the emergency messages are set apart from the non-emergency messages using '\n'. There have been requests that some special markers could be specifiable to make it easier for parsers."<br>

Diagnostic output isn't supposed to be "parsed by software", that's usually just a crude attempt at getting around lack of an interfacen supposed to provided what said software really wants to have. Hence, optimizing the output format to make the crude workaround easier to implement at the expense of making the intended purpose (debugging) more complicated are a bad idea.<br>

What does your tool do with boot messages? Today, the first 20 lines or so always end up with a timestamp of zero.<br>

In any case, if I were you I'd add my own timestamp (time when the message was read from the kernel).<br>

The application itself is designed to be restartable and I'm using the timestamp to find out unsynchronized logs - I'm just checking the last uploaded log timestamp and then proceed to sync everything that is at or after that timestamp.<br>
<p>
Multiple entries with the same timestamp are treated just fine (de-duped), the problem is timestamps going backwards.<br>

You really should be using the sequence number. That is a reliable, monotonically increasing value. (For my proposal as well.) Also, it allows you to identify if messages are missing.<br>

If you can call dmesg, I expect you can read /dev/kmsg as well. Take a look at the output of:<br>
<p>
cat /dev/kmsg<br>
<p>
The second field is the sequence number. You can read about the format here:<br>

Once upon a time, the way to get a patch into the mainline kernel was to
email it to Linus Torvalds.  A hopeful developer would then wait for Linus
to release a new kernel tree to see whether the patch had been included or
not.  In the latter case, the more persistent developers would resend the
patch.  Often, developers had to be persistent indeed if they wanted their
code to be merged.  The system was, in other words, lossy; we'll never know
how much useful code was simply dropped.
<p>
The use of git (and BitKeeper before it) has brought an end to that era.
Once a change gets into somebody's tree, it is relatively unlikely to be
lost.  It's a much better way of doing things for everybody involved;
important fixes no longer get lost, and developers, rather than checking
for their patches and resending them, can now devote themselves to the
creation of new bugs to be fixed.
<p>
Beyond that, though, things have changed in that, for most developers, the
way to get a patch into the kernel is no longer to send it to Linus.
Instead, they will pass their work through a subsystem tree.  This
mechanism is reasonably well understood, but, to your editor's knowledge,
nobody has taken a hard look at what the flow of patches into the mainline
looks like now.  With that in mind, your editor set out with the
complementary goals of (1)&nbsp;charting the paths patches take on their
way to Linus, and (2)&nbsp;figuring out how <a
href="http://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> works.  A certain amount of
success was achieved on both fronts.
<p>
Back in the BitKeeper days, your editor asked Larry McVoy if there was any
way to track which repositories a specific changeset had passed through;
unfortunately, that information was not preserved by BitKeeper.  As it
turns out, git does a better job of keeping that information around -
though it is not a perfect record keeper either.  When Linus pulls a tree
from some other developer, git will (usually) add a "merge commit" to the repository
which indicates where the other tree came from.  This commit has (at least)
two parent commits; one is whatever was at the tip of Linus's tree prior to
the merge, while the other points to the tip of the stream of changesets
which came from the pulled tree.  Multiple trees can be merged at once; in
this case, there will be more than two parent commits.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/318700/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/2.6.29-treeplot-sm.png" width=285 height=485
alt="[Tree plot]" align="right" border=0 hspace=2></a>

By following the links from each commit to its parent, one can determine
which tree each commit came from.  Merges, too, are propagated up through
pull operations, so it is possible to follow this history back through an
arbitrary number of trees.  The gitk tool does a nice job of displaying how
the various paths come together into a given repository; the resulting
graph can be quite complex.  What your editor has done is to generate a
statistical view of this process; this view loses information about
specific patches, but provides, instead, an overall view of how patches get
into the mainline.
<p>
A piece of the resulting graph can be seen on the right; click on the
thumbnail to see the whole thing, which is quite large.  It is, arguably, a
messy picture, but some interesting things jump out of it.  At the top of
the list is the fact that the graph is quite shallow: it shows 107 trees,
almost all of which feed directly into the mainline.  For the 2.6.29
development cycle, only a handful of trees are pulled into a separate
subsystem tree before going to Linus, and exactly one tree feeds patches
through two other layers.  For the most part, subsystem maintainers are
going straight to Linus without dealing with middle managers.
<p>
975 of 11,260 changesets went directly into the mainline without existing
in any subsystem tree at all.  Some of those are the merge changesets
created by Linus as he pulls trees; many of the rest are the patches which
go by way of Andrew Morton.  Linus wrote a very small number of them
himself.  And, occasionally, Linus merges a patch sent directly from a
developer, but that is a relatively uncommon occurrence.
<p>
When interpreting these numbers, there is one important thing which must be
kept in mind: by default, git will not record merge information when it is
doing a "fast forward" merge.  If a developer pulls down the current
mainline repository, adds some patches on top, then gets Linus to pull the
patches before anything else changes in the mainline, those patches can be
added directly to the mainline without the need for a merge commit to hold
things together.  Fast-forward merges into the mainline are (probably)
fairly rare, but they may well happen more often at the subsystem level.
So this kind of information, when generated from a git repository, will
never be 100% complete; some merges (and the repositories they came from)
will be invisible. 
<p>

For 2.6.29, two networking trees maintained by David Miller were the
biggest waypoint for changesets (1910 of them) headed into the mainline; of
those, many came from John Linville's wireless tree.  After that, the
"linux-2.6-tip" tree (the tree maintained by Ingo Molnar and company for a
few subsystems, including the x86 architecture and the scheduler)
contributed 1270 changesets to this development cycle.  Other large sources
of changes were the btrfs tree (910 changesets - the entire btrfs
development history), the Video4Linux tree, the sound tree, and the ARM
architecture tree.  At the other end of the scale, twelve trees were the
source of five or fewer changes.
<p>

For the curious, the statistics are available <a
href="/Articles/318701/">in text form</a> along with the full names of the
relevant git repositories.  The code which generated this information is
available as part of the gitdm repository at
<tt>git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git</tt>.  An obvious place for future
improvement is to track information about branches within repositories;
this would increase the resolution of the whole picture.  But that's for
another development cycle; stay tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One thing the article leaves out, is the number of patches that are cherry picked. I have a git tree that I use to send Ingo my patches. I usually base it off of his tip/master branch, and he must cherry pick them into the appropriate branches.<br>
<p>
Even if I base off one of his branches and he pulls it into that branch. After the merge window closes, Ingo cherry picks the patches that will go to Linus. Only the changes that fix bugs are usually in that category. If I send Ingo a series of changes that also contain a couple of bug fixes. He may need to cherry pick those bug fixes to send to Linus.<br>
<p>
All of the cherry picks lose the origin of the repo they came from.<br>

Your charting (or git more likely) doesn't seem to take into account fast forward merges.  This is evident by the lack of the sub-arch trees for PowerPC.  There are at least 3 trees that commits flow into before they go into benh's tree, and none of those are present in your chart.  Those sub-arch maintainers try to make it as easy as possible for benh to merge things, so the pull requests are often simple fast forwards on top of his tree.  I doubt you'd get a merge commit there.<br>

Just something I found interesting.<br>

      In fact, that's why the article expends a paragraph on the problem of fast-forward merges.  The information is simply lost in that case, and there's really not much that can be done about it.

True, but you can probably notice the committer information is different between the parent commit and the child commit.  Linus publishes his tip, David S Miller builds on top and gives Linus a pull request, and Linus fast-forwards.  Then these commits brought in to Linus's repository via Dave's repository will record Dave as the committer, not Linus.<br>

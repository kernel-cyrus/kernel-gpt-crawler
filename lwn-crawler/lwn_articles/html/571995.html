<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
Are we getting too lax in our acceptance of new code in the kernel?
Christoph Hellwig ran a session to explore that question.  It may be, he
said, that kernel maintainers are getting old and just don't have the
energy to fight against substandard code like they once used to; there is
very little pushback against ideas now.  The review process, he said, is
now focused on white-space issues rather than on whether the patch is
needed at all.  Nobody is willing to just decide that a problem is too
hard, resulting in things like the "Linux security modules debacle."
People don't want to make decisions or stick their necks out to turn stuff
down.
There are, Christoph said, two types of maintainer currently: those who
merge everything, and those who ignore everything.
<p>
Olof Johansson claimed that he and Arnd Bergmann have gotten pretty good at
pushing crap out of the ARM tree.  There are a lot of new subsystems with
energetic new maintainers, which helps.  The jury is still out, he said,
but things are running well at this point.
<p>
Ted Ts'o asked for specific examples of code that should not have been
merged.  Christoph responded that, once upon a time, it used to be hard to
merge patches that bloated core kernel data structures; now everything just
keeps growing.  He also pointed to the various filesystem notification
subsystems in the kernel, leading to a threat from Linus: he will kick

<a href="/Articles/572023/"><img

alt="[Christoph Hellwig]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

anybody who tries to submit another notification scheme.
Linus did allow that we are letting a lot of stuff through; he relies on
the top-level maintainers to push back and that isn't always happening,
despite the fact that he asks maintainers to say "no" more often.
<p>
Ted said that, ten years, ago, patches went through a lot more review by
developers other than the maintainer of the affected subsystem, but we just
can't scale to that kind of review anymore.  So maintainers are not paying
much attention to what is happening outside of their own subsystems, and a
lot of people have tuned out of the linux-kernel mailing list entirely.
Ingo Molnar suggested that we are seeing some of the natural results of a
distributed development model; the social structure, too, is more
distributed.  It was also pointed out that heavy criticism is frowned upon
more than it used to be.

</blockquote>
<p>
Christoph went on to mention the <a href="/Articles/562294/">problems with
O_TMPFILE</a>, which he described as "a trainwreck."  There are still
critical bugs being fixed with that code.  In general, he said, it often
seems that code going into the kernel has been rushed and hasn't had time
for proper review or testing.  Dave Jones added that, sometimes,
maintainers abuse Linus's trust and merge code that really is not ready to
go in.
<p>
Is the model of having a single maintainer for a subsystem still
appropriate?  Christoph noted that having multiple maintainers seems to
help to ensure adequate review of patches.  Perhaps group
maintenance should become more of the rule than the exception.  Tejun Heo
responded that we just don't have the manpower to have multiple maintainers
for a lot of subsystems.  He cited the workqueue code which, he said,
really needs somebody else with a deep understanding of what is going on
there, but, which, for years, was looked at by nobody but him.
<p>
Andrew Morton said that he often struggles with the question of whether
patches should be merged at all.  He pointed to the "zstuff" — transcendent
memory and related in-memory compression technologies; he kept pushing back
against the pressure to merge that code, hoping for an explanation of why
we needed it.  In the end, a couple of distributors picked it up; that
tipped the balance and made it hard to keep that code out.  Peter Zijlstra
described this as a sort of side-channel attack: distributors will carry
almost anything if their users bother them enough.  So, by harassing
distributors enough, developers can get controversial code merged into the
kernel.
<p>
What about patches that cause performance regressions?  The sense in the
room was that things have gotten a little bit better in that area.  Some
distributors are running more performance tests; this includes Mel Gorman's
work at SUSE and the tests run by Martin Petersen at Oracle.  Red Hat, too,
has been pushed to run more tests, but the people involved apparently feel
a little ignored at the moment.
<p>
Andrew came back in to repeat that he could really use more help in
deciding which features should or shouldn't be merged.  While being wary of
the idea 
that every problem can be solved with a new mailing list, he thought that
perhaps some sort of "graybeards@" list might be helpful for this kind of
question.  Linus agreed, suggesting that it should be a non-optional list
and that all Kernel Summit attendees should be subscribed.  If anybody
complains loudly, they could be removed, and the community would know that
they aren't interested in core issues and don't want to attend any more
summits.
<p>
There was some agreement on the creation of this list, but it was also
agreed that, somehow, the volume would need to be kept down.  Linus
suggested that it should not allow messages that are copied to any other
list.  There may also be a rule that no patches are posted to the list;
anything posted there would include links to discussions elsewhere.  Ted
closed out the session by saying that he would go ahead and create the list
and the members could work out the rules from there.

I'd imagine a lot of us already feel left out by not being able to attend the invite-only kernel summit, and now the graybeards are going to form a list to talk about our patches without us?? Is the archive at least going to be public??<br>
<p>
Finally, calling it "graybeards@"? Way to send a message to all the women developers OPW-kernel is working to hard to encourage that they're not welcome at the highest echelons. Why not just call it grumpyoldmen@? Something like maintainers@ would be so much better.<br>
<p>
On a more positive note, more co-maintainers sounds like a great idea. So far it seems like people are complaining about the work but nobody's asking for help. Maybe it goes back to that worry that delegating too much will result in losing a KS invite, or something?<br>

They said that all the kernel summit attendees were required to be on the list, I didn't see anything taking about the list being limited to such people.<br>

The list is neither named "greybeards@" nor is it closed, afaict. Unless I'm mixing it up with another list that was created, so I may be confused and won't actually point to the list I have in mind.<br>

      The details of the list are yet to be worked out.  No, it won't actually be called "graybeards", I'm pretty sure.

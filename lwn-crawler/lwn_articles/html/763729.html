The developers of the Android system have, among their many goals, the wish
to better protect Android devices against persistent compromise.  It is bad
if a device is taken over by an attacker; it's worse if it remains
compromised even after a reboot.  Numerous mechanisms for ensuring the
integrity of  installed system files have been proposed and implemented
over the years.  But it seems there is always room for one more; to fill
that space, the <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20180824161642.1144-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/">fs-verity</a>
mechanism is being proposed as a way to protect individual files from
malicious modification.
<p>
The core idea behind fs-verity is the generation of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> containing
hashes of the blocks of a file to be protected.  Whenever a page of that
file is read 
from storage, the kernel ensures that the hash of the page in question
matches the hash in the tree.
Checking hashes this way has a number of advantages.  Opening a file is
fast, since the entire contents of the file need not be hashed at open
time.  If only a small portion of the file is read, the kernel never has to
bother reading and checking the rest.  It is also possible to catch
modifications made to the file after it has been opened, which will not be
caught if the hash is checked at open time.
<p>
One could imagine a number of implementations where the kernel would create and
maintain the Merkle tree, and protect it from being modified in its own
right.  The actual implementation in fs-verity is not such a scheme,
though; much of the work is pushed out to user space.  Developers wanting
to know how to work with fs-verity will be needing to know how to do this
work; for now we are told that "<q>A documentation file in
Documentation/filesystems/ is planned but not yet included</q>".  So,
for now, one must reverse-engineer the patch set instead.
<p>
The
process starts with the creation of a file to be protected in the normal
way.  User space must then make a pass over the file to generate the Merkle
tree so that it can append a series of structures to the file:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The contents of the Merkle tree itself.
<li> An <tt>fsverity_descriptor</tt> structure (defined at the end of <a
     href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20180824161642.1144-2-ebiggers@kernel.org/">the
     first patch</a> in the series)  containing information about
     the fs-verity version in use, the hash algorithm employed, etc.  It
     also includes a count of "extension" structures to follow containing
     additional information.
<li> The series of extension structures.  One of these, for example,
     contains a signed copy of the root hash of the Merkle tree; this can be
     used to verify that the tree, itself, has not been tampered with.
<li> An <tt>fsverity_footer</tt> structure at the end of the file; it only
     contains a magic number and the offset of the
     <tt>fsverity_descriptor</tt> structure.
</ul>
<p>
Once user space has populated the file with this information, it must
reopen the file read-only, then perform an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call with the
<tt>FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY</tt> command (which takes no arguments).  A number
of interesting things happen at that point, starting with the fact that the
file is rendered immutable; it can be deleted, but the contents of the file
can no longer be changed.  The underlying filesystem tweaks the visible
length of the file so that it appears to end <i>before</i> the Merkle tree,
thus hiding the fs-verity metadata.  And, of course, it will also cause the
fs-verity checking to be performed for any subsequent accesses; any attempt
to read a page with the wrong hash will fail with an <tt>EIO</tt>
error. 
<p>

This is the first public posting of the fs-verity patch set, but the idea
has been circulating for a while; it was first <a
href="/Articles/763795/">described</a> in January, and was <a
href="/Articles/752614/">discussed</a> at the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.  While the idea of providing
integrity guarantees at the file level has some appeal, there are a number
of persistent concerns about this particular approach to the problem.
<p>
One that was extensively discussed in January is the overlap with the
kernel's integrity measurement architecture (IMA) mechanism, which already
exists to ensure the integrity of individual files.  There are a number of
reasons for avoiding IMA in this setting, it seems.  IMA itself is seen as
a large and complex mechanism that also requires cooperation from the
security-module subsystem; the Android developers are looking to avoid this
complexity.  IMA hashes an entire file at open time, making opens
expensive (especially when only a small part of the file is read) and
making it unable to catch changes made after the file has been opened.
And IMA is intended to protect a system starting at boot time, but Android
has its own boot-time mechanisms.
<p>
The fact that security modules are not involved in fs-verity
decisions at all was an area of disagreement in its own right.  IMA
developer Mimi Zohar <a href="/Articles/763838/">argued</a> that, while
fs-verity could check for file integrity, the policy decision of what to do
about a verification failure should be implemented in a security module. 
Ted Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/763796/">pointed out</a> that not all kernel security
mechanisms work with security modules, and maintained that fs-verity should
not either.

<p>
While it has not been implemented, the fs-verity developers have mentioned
the possibility of interoperating with IMA in the future.  In particular,
the fs-verity hashes could be used by IMA to verify files without having to
read their entire contents.
<p>
The "hide the Merkle tree after the end of the file" technique has raised
some concerns of its own.  It exposes the details of the mechanism to user
space, requiring that it will be supported forever and making it hard to
change.  Copying a file (to a backup, for example) will lose the verity
information.  Having the file be longer than its stated length may confuse
code in both the kernel and user space, and may be hard for some
filesystems to implement; the current patch set has support for ext4 and
f2fs.  This mechanism will also work 
poorly for network filesystems like NFS, which would like to have better
integrity support but which cannot access the hidden Merkle tree.
<p>
There does not appear to be a viable alternative to this mechanism at the
moment, though.  One often-suggested idea is to put the Merkle tree in an
extended attribute, but the amount of space available for extended
attributes is not enough to hold the tree for larger files.  It would be
possible to simply not store the lower levels of the tree and to regenerate
them when the file is opened — Merkle trees support working in that mode —
but that would add complexity and make opens more expensive.
<p>

The fs-verity developers also defend the current approach by noting the
advantages of storing the tree as ordinary file data.  The tree, which can
indeed become large, can be managed in the page cache in the usual way.  If
the underlying filesystem is encrypted, the fs-verity metadata will also be
encrypted with no additional effort.  Thus, fs-verity developer Eric
Biggers <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20180825041647.GA726@sol.localdomain/">argued</a>,
the best way to avoid the after-end-of-file hack would be to finally
support named file streams in the kernel.  That idea spawned
<a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20180825135107.GA12251@bombadil.infradead.org/">an
extensive thread of its own</a> that makes interesting reading for people
interested in the details; the executive summary is that the developers who
have looked at the problem are mostly united in thinking that it is not a
good idea.
<p>
The end result of all this is that there do not seem to be a lot of changes
in store for this patch set.  Nobody has — yet — put a foot down and
expressed outright opposition to it being merged in its current form.
Unless that changes, something closely resembling the current patch set 
seems likely to find its way into the mainline fairly soon.

So, dm-verity makes a whole block device immutable and verifies that it matches a tree of hashes, often provided separately such as via a root hash on the kernel command line. (Chrome OS uses this.)<br>
<p>
fs-verity includes the hashes inline in the filesystem. What integrity properties does this provide that standard immutable files don't? If you can modify the filesystem, you can modify the hash tree. If you *can't* modify the filesystem, then you couldn't change an immutable file either. And I don't see anything about chaining those file-level hashes up to a higher-level hash provided elsewhere.<br>
<p>
So I think I'm missing the threat model that fs-verity protects against.<br>

The top-level file hash, or "file measurement", is *not* stored on disk.  It's up to either userspace (via FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY) or an in-kernel policy (like the built-in signature support in v1 patch 07/10, or the planned IMA support) to do something with that top-level hash, such as verifying that it matches a known good value, matches a valid digital signature, or even just logging it.  In the Android APK use case, the hash will be verified against a signature.<br>
<p>
With just a regular immutable file there is no such file hash available.  Of course, you can just hash the whole file, but that is slow on large files, and the contents could change when paged into memory again (which fs-verity detects, like dm-verity).<br>

It seems like this is a natural fit for something like ZFS. It can store checksums as SHA256, and these are already in a tree structure, which is itself checksummed.<br>
<p>
Additionally if the use-case is primarily to boot off known-good immutable data-set, then booting from a ZFS snapshot would do the trick :)<br>
<p>
I would assume btrfs can do some or all of this too.<br>
<p>
However I guess in Google's case they may not be interested in shifting Android onto another filesystem, hence the effort to build it on top of ext4.<br>

<h1>NAPI performance - a weighty matter</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 15, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
Modern network interfaces are easily capable of handling thousands of
packets per second.  They are also capable of burying the host processor
under thousands of interrupts per second.  As a way of dealing with the
interrupt problem (and fixing some other things as well), the networking
hackers added the NAPI driver interface.  NAPI-capable drivers can, when
traffic gets high, turn off receive interrupts and collect incoming packets
in a polling mode.  Polling is normally considered to be bad news, but,
when there is always data waiting on the interface, it turns out to be the
more efficient way to go.  Some details on NAPI can be found in <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/30107/">this LWN Driver Porting Series
article</a>; rather more details are available from the networking chapter
in <a href="/Kernel/LDD3/">LDD3</a>.
<p>

One of the things NAPI-compliant drivers must do is to specify the "weight"
of each interface.  The weight parameter helps to determine how important
traffic from that interface is - it limits the number of packets each
interface can feed to the networking core in each polling cycle.  This
parameter also controls whether the interface runs in the polling mode or
not; by the NAPI conventions, an interface which does not have enough
built-up traffic to fill its quota of packets (where the quota is
determined by 
the interface's weight) should go back to the interrupt-driven mode.  The
weight is thus a fundamental parameter controlling how packet reception is
handled, but there has never been any real guidance from the networking
crew on how the weight should be set.  Most driver writers pick a value
between 16 and 64, with interfaces capable of higher speeds usually setting
larger values.
<p>

Some recent discussions on the netdev list have raised the issue of how the
weight of an interface should be set.  In particular, the e1000 driver
hackers have discovered that their interface tends to perform better when
its weight is set lower - with the optimal value being around 10.
Investigations into this behavior continue, but a few observations have
come out; they give a view into what is really required to get top
performance out of modern hardware.
<p>

One problem, which appears to be specific to the e1000, is that the
interface runs out of receive buffers.  The e1000 driver, in its
<tt>poll()</tt> function, will deliver its quota of packets to the
networking core; only when that process is complete does the driver concern
itself with providing more receive buffers to the interface.  So one
short-term tactic would be to replenish the receive buffers more often.
Other interface drivers tend not to wait until an entire quota has been
processed to perform this replenishment.  Lowering the weight of an
interface is one way to force this replenishment to happen more often
without actually changing the driver's logic.
<p>

But questions remain: why is the system taking so long to process 64
packets that a 256-packet ring is being exhausted?  And why does
performance increase for smaller weights even when packets are not being
dropped?  One possible explanation is that the actual amount of work being
done for each packet in the networking core can vary greatly depending on
the type of traffic being handled.  Big TCP streams, in particular, take
longer to process than bursts of small UDP packets.  So, depending on the
workload, processing one quota's worth of packets might take quite some
time.
<p>

This processing time affects performance in a number of ways.  If the
system spends large bursts of time in software interrupt mode to deal with
incoming packets, it will be starving the actual application for processor
time.  The overall latency of the system goes up, and performance goes
down.  Smaller weights can lead to better interleaving of system and
application time.
<p>
A related issue is this check in the networking core's polling logic:
<p>
<pre>
	if (budget <= 0 || jiffies - start_time > 1)
		goto softnet_break;
</pre>
<p>
Essentially, if the networking core spends more than about one half of one
jiffy (very approximately 500 &mu;sec on most systems) polling interfaces,
it decides that things have gone on for long enough and it's time to take a
break.  If one high-weight interface is taking a lot of time to get its
packets through the system, the packet reception process can be cut short
early, perhaps before other interfaces have had their opportunity to deal
with their traffic.  Once again, smaller weights can help to mitigate this
problem.
<p>

Finally, an overly large weight can work against the performance of an
interface when traffic is at moderate levels.  If the driver does not fill
its entire quota in one polling cycle, it will turn off polling and go back
into interrupt-driven mode.  So a steady stream of traffic which does not
quite fill the quota will cause the driver to bounce between the polling
and interrupt modes, and the processor will have to handle far more
interrupts that would otherwise be expected.  Slower interfaces
(100&nbsp;Mb/sec and below) are particularly vulnerable to this problem; on a
fast system, such interfaces simply cannot receive enough data to fill the
quota every time.
<p>

From all this information, some conclusions have emerged:
<p>
<ul>

<li> There needs to be a smarter way of setting each interface's weight; 
     the current "grab the setting from some other driver" approach does
     not always yield the right results.
<p>
<li> The direct tie between an interface's weight and its packet quota is
     too simple.  Each interface's quota should actually be determined, at
     run time, by the amount of work that interface's packet stream is
     creating. 
<p>
<li> The quota value should not also be the threshold at which drivers
     return to interrupt-driven mode.  The cost of processor interrupts is
     high enough that polling mode should be used as long as traffic
     exists,  even when an interface almost never fills its quota.
</ul>
<p>

Changing the code to implement these conclusions is likely to be a long
process.  Fundamental tweaks in the core of the networking code can lead to
strange performance regressions in surprising places.  In the mean time,
Stephen Hemminger has posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/138781/">a
patch</a> which creates a sysfs knob for the interface weight.  That patch
has been merged for 2.6.12, so people working on networking performance
problems will soon be able to see if adjustable interface weights can be
part of the solution.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

 <br>
As soon as I saw that initially described earlier in the article, I /knew/ <br>
it was going to cause issues.  I'm not a C programmer, yet even /I/ can <br>
see that.  Virtually /everything/ from common HVAC thermostats, to <br>
filesystem cache mechanisms, to, one would /expect/, network interface <br>
quotas, works with a high value that triggers the switch into "high <br>
activity" mode, after which it STAYS in the new mode until the sampled <br>
measure falls below the low value (which is somewhere below the high <br>
value), at which point the system switches back to "low activity" mode.  <br>
Failure to have such a lo/hi range by using a single threshold value <br>
ALWAYS triggers inefficient bouncing, for /some/ range of possible values, <br>
or the threshold value wouldn't be needed at all as a single mode would be <br>
all that was required.  Simple logic, demonstrated in practice over and <br>
over again, in both the real and virtual world. <br>
 <br>
&lt;shrug&gt;  I guess this is demonstration of the open source adage that all <br>
bugs (and their solutions) are shallow to /somebody/, and an open source <br>
solution maximizes the possibility that said "somebody" will be exposed to <br>
the issue. <br>
 <br>
OTOH, it's likely only clear to me due to the excellent explanation here <br>
in LWN, which of course the original implementors didn't have the <br>
privilege of seeing, since they were writing the code upon which the <br>
explanation was based.  &lt;g&gt; <br>

      I just read the conclusion and although ive never posted here before, I think it is misleading, so let me set the record straight - because the entire explanation of the behavior has nothing to do with NAPI ;-&gt;<br>
<p>
Maybe an anology would help:<br>
Lets say you had a restaurant that could seat 64 people (weight). And lets say you also had a queue outside the restaurant that could accomodate up to 256(rx ring size) people and any person arriving when the queue was full was stamped by the bouncer to never come back (strange restaurant -it's a bad remake of the seinfield soup nazi episode).<br>
Lets also say that this is a strange queue in which every time the bouncer  allowed someone into the restaurant the person behind doesnt move forward to take the empty slot unless the bouncer told them to.<br>
<p>
On Tuesdays the 2-for-1 day the rate of people arriving is a lot faster than they are departing departing the restaurant.<br>
<p>
Now lets see what the (e1000 driver) bouncer was doing on that tuesday:<br>
Bouncer allows 64 people in but doesnt move the queue to fill the empty slots until all 64 are all done eating.  Because people are coming in faster than they are departing the restaurant, this means the 256 people queue is filling up and people arriving after that are sent back. All in the meantime these 64 empty slots exist in the front ;-&gt; (i.e no replenishing is happening)<br>
Lets say we hired a new bouncer who decides to allow the queue to move forward every time someone goes into the restaurant (this means one more person can move into the last slot of the queue). Of course the implicit assumption is everytime someone goes in, it is because someone is done eating (i.e a packet has been processed). If this mode was followed, then over a specific period of time more people will eat at that restaurant because relatively less people will be turned away by the new bouncer.<br>
<p>
So as you can see, this really has nothing to do with the seating of the<br>
restaurant (the weight); it has to do with how fast people can eat and how fast new ones can come in (assuming the bouncer was doing the right thing to begin with - which the e1000 wasnt). <br>
On tuesdays people take longer to eat - to improve the capacity, we need to figure out why they take that long.<br>
<p>
So onto the conclusions and to refute them;-&gt;<br>
Bullet 1 of conclusion: <br>
-Weight (the size of the restaurant) has no effect on this specific issue. <br>
Get yourself a smarter bouncer;-&gt; You are wrong if you think that the smarter bouncer is the one that allows only 10 people into the restaurant<br>
on tuesdays. And 20 on wednesdays. To reiterate the smarter bouncer is the one that allows a new person into the restaurant every time someone leaves.<br>
<p>
Bullet 2 of conclusion:<br>
- As a result of the above, quota has nothing to do with how much work the system can handle. It's how fast the customers arrive and how fast they are fed.<br>
<p>
Bullet 3 of conclusion:<br>
- Thats exactly what napi does already. Interupts are never enabled unless there are absolutely no packets detected as coming in<br>
<p>
Now on what the weight and quota are really for:<br>
The drivers which have packets are scheduled on whats known as a<br>
Deficit Round Robin(DRR) Algorithm to provide packets to the system.<br>
This system is used to enforce fairness among nics with incoming packets.<br>
If a 10Mbps nic has packets, it should not be overrun because a 10Gbps<br>
card has more packets to send. The weight is the maximum opportunity<br>
that a specific NIC will have packets to send onto the stack.<br>
If you wanted to make a NIC more important than another, you give it a<br>
higher weight (which is what Stephens patch will allow). <br>
<p>
Overall on that thread:<br>
I think the question that needs asking is why people are taking so long<br>
in the restaurant?<br>
Is it the fact they dont get their food on time, or is it because they dont<br>
get their bills on time? Now that would be a very useful exercise. Unfortunately the majority of the thread was spent on explaining it on how to improve NAPI.<br>
I think one thing that should have been turned off is contracking;<br>
<p>
I actually dont think the act of replenishing the descriptor on every<br>
packet is the best scheme - but thats an entirely different topic and i have said enough already.<br>
 <br>

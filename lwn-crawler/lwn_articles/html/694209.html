<p>
There are various types of limits and privileges that administrators can
apply to processes or control groups (cgroups) in Linux, but it is sometimes
difficult to determine what those values should beâ€”except by trial and
error.  A <a 
href="/Articles/691112/">patch set</a> from Topi Miettinen targets making
that easier by tracking resource and capability usage by processes in order
to give users and administrators a starting point to use when setting those
values.  The idea is that the processes can be run under a normal load and
the high-water values (as well as the capabilities used) will be recorded
to provide a guide for future, more-restrictive deployments.
</p>

<p>
The 18-patch series is broken up into three groups: capabilities used (one
patch), cgroup limits (three patches), and resource limits (14
patches).  Capabilities used are reported in <tt>/proc/PID/status</tt>,
while cgroup maximums are presented in files in the cgroup
filesystem.  Resource limits (i.e. <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prlimit.2.html">rlimits</a>), on
the other hand, are reported in the <tt>/proc/PID/limits</tt> file.  Those
may change since there are programs that parse the files in <tt>/proc</tt>,
so adding more information could potentially alter the user-space interface
for the kernel.
</p>

<p>
As Miettinen says in the cover letter for the patches, much of the information
can already be gleaned from various <tt>/proc</tt> files and using tools
like <tt>ps</tt>, but those methods only give a value at one point in
time.  In order to be sure that transient spikes are also recorded, so they
can be taken into account, the kernel needs to be involved; thus these patches.
</p>

<p>
But  Konstantin Khlebnikov <a href="/Articles/694250/">objected</a> to the
overall goal:
<div class="BigQuote">
All limitations are context dependent and that context changes rapidly.
You'll never dump enough information for predicting future errors or
investigating [the reason] of errors in past.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He also suggested that tracepoints could be used (perhaps in conjunction with
SystemTap or other kernel tracing infrastructure), rather than adding
high-water recording to the kernel.
</p>

<p>
But both Miettinen and  Austin S. Hemmelgarn disagreed with that analysis.  Miettinen
<a href="/Articles/694252/">noted</a> that there are always risks when
setting limits, but that the patches are just meant to help provide some
guidance.  Hemmelgarn <a href="/Articles/694253/">essentially agreed</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
It's still better than what we have now, and there is one particular use
for the cgroup stuff that I find intriguing, you can create a cgroup,
populate it, set no limits, and then run a simulated workload against it
and see how it reacts.  This in general will probably provide a better
starting point for what to actually set the limits to than just making an
arbitrary guess.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Rlimits could be handled similarly, he said.  Beyond that, though, there
are different types of failure modes for processes that cannot get the
resources they need (e.g. can't start a thread or process), which may not
manifest as application errors or crashes.  In addition, getting the
information about 
the maximum usage from
user space will be difficult or impossible, he said.  In a follow-up <a
href="/Articles/694256/">post</a>, he also noted that tracing can't supply
any better answers for the upper bound of these values than internal kernel
tracking can: "<q>You can't get a perfectly reliable upper bound for any
type of resource 
usage with just black box observations, period.</q>"
</p>

<p>
There were also comments on many of the individual patches.  The <a
href="/Articles/694257/">capabilities-tracking patch</a> simply adds a
<tt>cap_used</tt> bit array to <tt>struct&nbsp;task_struct</tt> and sets
the bit corresponding to a capability whenever that capability is
checked (and passes the check).  But as Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/Articles/694270/">pointed out</a>, simply tracking the capabilities
used by a process won't work well in the
presence of <a href="/Articles/632520/">ambient capabilities</a>.  If a
process runs a program with ambient capabilities, which uses some
capabilities beyond what the main process uses, those will be missed in the
set of capabilities 
collected.  He suggested tracking capabilities used for an entire process
tree or cgroup.  
</p>

<p>
The cgroup patches track values for three specific controllers: the
maximum PIDs used in a PID cgroup, maximum memory used in a memory
cgroup, and the devices accessed in a device cgroup. The PID cgroup <a
href="/Articles/694275/">patch</a> uses an atomic variable to track the
highest number of PIDs that 
have been active in the cgroup at any point. It makes
that number available 
in the <tt>pids.current_max</tt> file.  Cgroup maintainer Tejun Heo <a
href="/Articles/694276/">didn't like the name</a> (he suggested
a <tt>high_watermark</tt> field in the <tt>pids.stats</tt> file) and was
concerned that some
of the atomic variable handling that could lead to races.
 
<p>
The
<a href="/Articles/694277/">patch</a> for the memory cgroup simply presents
the existing <tt>watermark</tt> value in the <tt>memory.current_max</tt>
file.  But, as Johannes Weiner <a href="/Articles/694278/">noted</a>, that
generally won't provide much useful information.  The page cache is counted
in that watermark and is not reduced in size unless there is memory
pressure, "<q>so in all but very
few cases the high watermark you are introducing will be pegged to the
configured limit</q>".  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/694286/">last</a> of the cgroup patches keeps a list
of devices that are accessed in a device cgroup.  That list, which contains
the device type (character or block), major and minor numbers, and access
type (read, write, or mknod), can be read from the
<tt>devices.accessed</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
The rlimit patches drew fewer comments in general (or, perhaps, the
comments were outweighed by the sheer number of patches).  There was some
general 
confusion because Miettinen did not send a copy of the cover letter (or the first
rlimit <a href="/Articles/694288/">patch</a> that added some infrastructure
used by the rest) to everyone who got copies of the individual patches.
In addition, the function name used to update the current maximum value,
<tt>bump_rlimit()</tt>, was confusing to some, since it seems to imply that
the actual rlimit is being increased (bumped).
</p>

<p>
There are individual patches to record (and sometimes report) the maximum use of
different resources that are tied to rlimits.  That includes the number of
open files (<tt>RLIMIT_NOFILE</tt>), CPU usage (<tt>RLIMIT_CPU</tt>), file sizes created
(<tt>RLIMIT_FSIZE</tt>), number of processes (<tt>RLIMIT_NPROC</tt>), and
so on.  There were some complaints about race conditions and using
read-copy-update (RCU) incorrectly, along with some suggestions for better
comments to make the intent of the code clearer.  Aside from the <a
href="/Articles/694304/">final patch</a> in the series, which Kees Cook <a
href="/Articles/694305/">pointed out</a> was unneeded, the series as a
whole got a fairly warm response. 
</p>

<p>
There is clearly some work to be done, but maximum resource usage tracking seems
like a feature that  
might make its way into the kernel in, say, 4.9 or 4.10 unless some major
opposition appears.  It will provide users with a way to gauge what their
processes are doing so that limits and privileges can be tightened down
appropriately.  It certainly won't provide all the answers, but may give
the starting point that Miettinen is seeking.

Sounds certainly useful.<br>
<p>
When working with unprivileged containers and trying to minimize the capability set for container root I have once done a quick and dirty patch to my kernel to report failing capability checks.<br>
<p>
Mostly this works well, if the capability test fails the software fails to work as intended. However, I hit one exception somewhere related to mmap(). In every call there will be a test for some capability. Here, failure in this test does not mean that the whole syscall will fail, it just means that a different code path is taken, were both can still succeed. I did not need to investigate the details, because it turned out that my user space worked just fine, despite the missing capability and the failing test.<br>
<p>
Well, I would need to search my old git branch and compare with the suggested patch how they handle this case. It might be quite tricky for the kernel to decide whether the caller really needs the capability in question or whether it will be happy with the other code path.<br>

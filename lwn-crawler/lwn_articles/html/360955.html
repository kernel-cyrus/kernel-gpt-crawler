<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 11, 2009</br>
           </div>
"Fanotify" is a much-revised system for providing filesystem event
notifications to user space, and, possibly, allowing user space to block
<tt>open()</tt> operations on specific files.  The intended use case is
malware-scanning utilities, but there are others: hierarchical storage has
been cited as one possibility.  This code has had a long, hard path into
the kernel for a couple of reasons: kernel developers are not big fans of
malware scanning, and nailing down the user-space ABI has been
challenging.
<p>
The first obstacle has been more-or-less overcome.  Even developers who
think that malware scanning is the worst sort of security snake oil can
agree that having these utilities use a well-defined kernel interface is
better than having them employ nasty tricks like hooking into the system
call table.  ABI difficulties can be harder to overcome, though.  With <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/359840/">the latest fanotify posting</a>,
developer Eric Paris may have resolved this issue for at least a portion of
the fanotify functionality.
<p>
The new version does away with the novel interface using
<tt>setsockopt()</tt> in favor of a couple of new system calls.  The first
of these is <tt>fanotify_init()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int fanotify_init(unsigned int flags, unsigned int event_f_flags,
		      int priority);
</pre>
<p>
This system call initializes the fanotify subsystem, returning a file
descriptor which is used for further operations.  There are two
<tt>flags</tt> values implemented: <tt>FAN_NONBLOCK</tt> creates a
nonblocking file descriptor, and <tt>FAN_CLOEXEC</tt> sets the
close-on-exec flag.  Currently, <tt>event_f_flags</tt> and
<tt>priority</tt> are unused; they should be set to zero.
<p>
Management of notification events is then done with
<tt>fanotify_mark()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int fanotify_mark(int fanotify_fd, unsigned int flags,
		      int dfd, const char *pathname, u64 mask,
		      u64 ignored_mask);
</pre>
<p>
This call is used to "mark" specific parts of the filesystem hierarchy,
indicating an interest in events involving those files.
<tt>fanotify_fd</tt> is the file descriptor returned by
<tt>fanotify_init()</tt>.  The <tt>flags</tt> parameter must be one of
<tt>FAN_MARK_ADD</tt> or <tt>FAN_MARK_REMOVE</tt>, indicating whether this
call adds new marks or removes existing ones; there are also a couple of
flags to control following of symbolic links and the marking of directories
(without their contents).
<p>
The file(s) to be marked are determined by <tt>dfd</tt> and
<tt>pathname</tt>; these parameters work much like in any of the
<tt>*at()</tt> system calls.  If <tt>dfd</tt> is <tt>AT_FDCWD</tt>, the
<tt>pathname</tt> is resolved using the current working directory.  If,
instead, <tt>dfd</tt> points to a directory, the <tt>pathname</tt> lookup
starts at that directory.  If <tt>pathname</tt> is null, though, then
<tt>dfd</tt> is interpreted as the actual object to mark.
<p>
Finally, <tt>mask</tt> and <tt>ignored_mask</tt> control which events are
reported.  To generate a specific event, a file must have the appropriate
flag set in <tt>mask</tt> and clear in <tt>ignored_mask</tt>.  The flags
are <tt>FAN_ACCESS</tt> (file access),
<tt>FAN_MODIFY</tt> (a file is modified),
<tt>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</tt> (a writable file has been closed),
<tt>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</tt> (a read-only file has been closed),
<tt>FAN_OPEN</tt> (a file has been opened), and
<tt>FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD</tt> (events on children of a directory).  There is
also a <tt>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</tt> event for event queue overflows, but that is
not currently implemented.
<p>
Once files have been marked, the application can simply read from the
fanotify file descriptor to get events.  The events look like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct fanotify_event_metadata {
	__u32 event_len;
	__u32 vers;
	__s32 fd;
	__u64 mask;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>event_len</tt> is the length of the structure, <tt>vers</tt>
indicates which version of fanotify generated the structure, <tt>fd</tt> is
an open file descriptor for the object being accessed, and <tt>mask</tt>
describes what is actually happening.
<p>
There is one crucial component missing in these patches: there is no way
for the fanotify user to react to these events.  In particular, the ability
to block an <tt>open()</tt> call, a core part of the malware-scanning
process, is missing.  That, presumably, is to be added in a future
revision.  Meanwhile, Eric has requested permission to put the notification
code into linux-next, presumably with a 2.6.33 merge in mind.  As of this
writing, objections have not been forthcoming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I hope fanotify fixes one things that is really missing in the inotify API: some way to identify if some event was triggered by the process that is listening.<br>
<p>
i.e. what inotify currently sucks at is to use it for reading files or devices nodes that have just been closed. i.e. a loop such as "for (;;) { wait_until_someone_closes_a_file_after_writing(); check_what_changed(); }", since the check_what_changed() call might itself open() and close() the file/device node, one would enter a loop here which is very hard to break, since one cannot distuingish between events that were triggered by the process itself or by someone else. An easy fix this could be to include the PID of the process that triggered an event. That way programs could simply ignore all events triggered by themselves.<br>

Pid is included in later patches.<br>
<p>
Also you have an open fd which will not cause you to get events.  So you can just operate on that fd and you won't hit the loop, open files yourself and you will get events for it.<br>

 Some would say the other intended use case is malware-spreading utilities, it is better to "infect" executables which are often executed than those who lay dormant... and having a standard interface for viruses would greatly simplify their development.<br>
 Moreover, because it seems you should be able to use multiple independant virus checker, you can hook "under" or "over" a virus checker, to hide your virus from upper layers, or to add it once the file has been certified clean.<br>

That's an argument for keeping useful features out of the kernel?  Are you kidding??<br>

Pretty much all viruses are transferred via network.  Does that mean that the networking stack should be removed from the kernel?<br>

How fun ... here we have two consecutive articles, one dealing with making several file operations a transaction, the other trying to break down open() into two distinct operations (call userspace to check if I can open(), then open() for real).<br>
I hardly see how both these approches can coexist ...<br>

Transactions have been invented in databases, and in that context it's obvious that part of a transaction may fail; and even in btrfs transactions allow for failures. So, what's the problem here?<br>
A bigger problem is instead that during the transaction the filesystem is locked, so userspace needs to avoid modifying the fs during the check, if btrfs is used. It's possible I guess, the atime change problem needs to be solved to perform reads, but that's doable. But if developers don't test this scenario, they won't notice.<br>

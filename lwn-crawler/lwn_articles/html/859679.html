<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 14, 2021</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/quotactl.2.html"><tt>quotactl()</tt>
system call</a> is used to manipulate disk quotas on a filesystem; it can
be used to turn quota enforcement on or off, change quotas, retrieve
current usage information, and more.  The 5.13 merge window brought in a
new variant of that system call that was subsequently disabled due to API
concerns; its replacement is now taking form.
<p>
<tt>quotactl()</tt> has the following prototype:
<p>
<pre>
    int quotactl(int cmd, const char *special, int id, caddr_t addr);
</pre>
<p>
Quota manipulation is a filesystem-oriented operation, but
<tt>quotactl()</tt> requires that the caller provide the name of the block
device containing the target filesystem (as <tt>special</tt>).  That can
require users (who typically think in terms of mount points) or user-space
tools to do a lookup to find out which block device underlies the
filesystem of interest.  For filesystems that do not <i>have</i> an
underlying block device, <tt>quotactl()</tt> is not usable at all; among
others, the <a href="/Articles/276025/">UBIFS</a> filesystem, which uses
persistent memory for storage, is affected by this problem.
<p>
The new system call was introduced to address these issues:
<p>
<pre>
    int quotactl_path(unsigned int cmd, const char *mountpoint, qid_t id,
    		      void *addr);
</pre>
<p>
Rather than accepting a device name, <tt>quotactl_path()</tt> uses the path
name of the mount point where the filesystem is to be found.
<p>
Shortly after this new system call was pulled into the mainline (during the
5.13 merge window), an LWN reader <a href="/Articles/855954/">pointed
out</a> that 
<tt>quotactl_path()</tt> failed to follow contemporary best practices for
system calls.  In particular, it lacked a "flags" argument for future extensions,
and there was no directory file-descriptor argument as found in system
calls like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html"><tt>openat2()</tt></a>.
In response to those criticisms, the new system call was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5b9fedb31e47">disabled</a>
in the 5.13-rc3 release so that the problems could be fixed.
<p>
On June 2, Jan Kara posted <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20210602151553.30090-1-jack@suse.cz/">a proposed
replacement</a> for <tt>quotactl_path()</tt>.  Rather than simply add the
new parameters, though, the new call does away with the path name entirely:
<p>
<pre>
    int quotactl_fd(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, qid_t id, void *addr);
</pre>
<p>
With <tt>quotactl_fd()</tt>, the caller is expected to provide an open file
descriptor identifying the filesystem to operate on.  The advantage of
doing things this way is that the full complexity of handling the directory
file descriptor, resolve flags, etc. can be deferred to <tt>openat2()</tt>
rather than being reimplemented here.  For usage involving multiple
<tt>quotactl_fd()</tt> calls, reusing a file descriptor that only need be
opened once should be more efficient anyway.
<p>
Note that there still is no "flags" argument.  In this case, that should not
be problematic; the system call can always be extended by adding new
commands.  In short, as Kara pointed out in the cover letter, the new
system call looks a lot like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>,
with all the flexibility associated with that call.
<p>
Looked at from one angle, this incident could appear to be a failure of the
process; how did a system call with these problems get into the mainline?
Sometimes code is rushed into the kernel without adequate review, but this
patch set was posted three times (in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210128141713.25223-1-s.hauer%40pengutronix.de/">January</a>,
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210211153024.32502-1-s.hauer@pengutronix.de/">February</a>,
and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210304123541.30749-1-s.hauer@pengutronix.de/">March</a>)
before being merged.  Developers clearly looked at the patches and a number
of changes were made, but nobody caught the API problems.
<p>
But this episode could also be seen as an example of the process working
exactly as it is supposed to.  The period between the merge window and
the 5.13 release is there to catch remaining issues, and this one was duly
pointed out.  The system call was immediately disabled to ensure that it
would not be released in that form, after which it would likely have been
necessary to maintain it indefinitely.  And now a better replacement has
been created.
<p>
That replacement has been reviewed (and approved) by a few relevant
developers, including Sascha Hauer, the author of the original
<tt>quotactl_path()</tt> implementation.  It has not, as of 5.13-rc6, been
pushed into the mainline kernel.  Kara hasn't said whether he plans to get
this work into 5.13 before its release; if so, the time to do so is quickly
running out.  The alternative is to push it during the 5.14 merge window;
that would allow for another cycle of review to be sure that there are
truly no more lingering issues.  Given that this API has needed one rework
and that 5.13 is due in less than two weeks, waiting may well prove to be
the more prudent approach.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Is it an out-of-season Halloween joke, or has flexibility acquired the meaning of &#x27;causing people to run away screaming&#x27; ?<br>
<p>
Because this is the usual effect of debugging an ioctl call.<br>

Actually the functionality of quotactl is limited enough that even though it is multiplexer kind of syscall working with it does not challenge one&#x27;s sanity. We have actually discussed moving to a set of syscalls instead of quotactl_path/fd syscall but in the end most people were just for one multiplexer syscall instead of like 6-8 new syscalls.<br>

Could this sort of thing be avoided by maintaining a checklist of things that need to be considered for every new syscall, or do syscalls differ enough that you&#x27;d end up with a hundred item checklist of which only half a dozen apply to any particular proposal?<br>

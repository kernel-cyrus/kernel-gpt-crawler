<h1>Integrity management in the kernel</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 28, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Certain patches seem to pop up occasionally on the kernel lists for years.
One of those is the whole integrity management patch set from IBM; these
patches were last covered here in <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/160157/">November, 2005</a>.  They are back
for consideration yet again.  Integrity management still looks like it is
not ready for inclusion into the mainline, but it is getting closer; at
some point it will force consideration of some interesting questions.
<p>

The core idea behind integrity management is providing some sort of
assurance that the files on the system have not been messed with.  David
Safford <a href="/Articles/227939/">described it</a> this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	[B]asically this integrity provider is designed to complement
	mandatory access control systems like selinux and slim. Such
	systems can protect a running system against on-line attacks, but
	do not protect against off-line attacks (booting Knoppix and
	changing executables or their selinux labels), or against attacks
	which find weaknesses in the kernel or the LSM module itself.
</div>
<p>
The current patches work, at the lowest level, by defining a new set of
security module hooks for an "integrity provider."  The provider can hook
into system calls which access or execute files and check the integrity of
those files; should it conclude that Bad Things have happened, access to
the files can be denied.  On top of that is the EVM ("extended verification
module") code, which checks the integrity of files (and their
metadata) by checksumming them and comparing the result with a value stored
as an extended attribute.  The IBAC (integrity-based access control) module
can then use EVM and the LSM hooks to allow or deny access to files based
on the conclusions reached by the integrity checker.
<p>

All of this can work using a passphrase supplied by the system
administrator, but the intended mode of operation uses the trusted platform
module (TPM) built into an increasing number of computers.  With
cooperation from the system's BIOS, the TPM can do an effective job of
checksumming the software running on the system.  The TPM also performs
basic cryptographic functions, like signing the checksums used to verify
the integrity of files.  The key aspect of the system, though, is that the
TPM can be set up to create these signatures only if the checksums for the
running system match a set of pre-configured values.  The end result is
that the checksums associated with files cannot be changed on another
system or by booting a different kernel - at least, not in a way which
preserves their value as checksums.  If the system holds together as
advertised, it should be able to prevent attacks based on changing 
the files used by the system.
<p>

Beyond that, this system supports remote attestation: providing a
TPM-signed checksum to a third party which proves that only approved
software is running on the system.
<p>

There are clear advantages to a structure like this.  A Linux-based teller
machine, say, or a voting machine could ensure that it has not been
compromised and prove its integrity to the network.  Administrators in
charge of web servers can use the integrity code in similar ways.  In
general, integrity management can be a powerful tool for people who want to
be sure that the systems they own (or manage) have not be reconfigured into
spam servers when they weren't looking.
<p>


The other side of this coin is that integrity management can be a powerful
tool for those who wish to maintain control over systems they do not own.
Should it be merged, the kernel will come with the tools needed to create a
locked-down system out of the box.  As these modules get
closer to mainline confusion, we may begin to see more people getting
worried about them.  Quite a few kernel developers may oppose license terms
intended to prevent "tivoization," but that doesn't mean they want to actively
support that sort of use of their software.  Certainly it would be harder
to argue against the shipping of locked-down, Linux-based gadgets when the
kernel, itself, provides the lockdown tools.
<p>

For now, that issue can be avoided; there are still plenty of more mundane
problems with this patch set.  But, sooner or later, the integrity
management developers are going to get past the lower-level issues; they
have certainly shown persistence in working on this patch.  Based on his
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/30048/">prior statements</a>, Linus is
unlikely to oppose the merging of these modules 
once they are ready.  Whether the rest of the development community will be
so welcoming remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      yeah, reading about these patches gives a distinct feeling the most important usecase is locking the user into certain software, eg Tivio-like stuff. I don't like it... It's lovely to be able to check if your server has been compromised, but it's a bit TOO lovely to be able to see if a user has modified any of the software on the device he/she bought from you, and deny his/her right to use it based on that.<br>

      Take the following path: <br>
1. inject some code into kernelspace, via known vulnerability; <br>
2. this code makes the kernel present to the TPM (*) the original file to <br>
generate the signature (that will be sent to the network), but execute <br>
another file altogether; <br>
3. ... <br>
4. Profit!!! <br>
:-) <br>
Sorry for the /.-ism, but that's it. This should be kept out of the <br>
kernel, not because of its immorality, but because of its ineffectivity. <br>
(*) funny thing is, in Portuguese, this is the acronym to PMS :-) <br>

      It isn't intended to protect against vulnerabilities in the kernel (as I read the description), but rather to protect against offline compromise, as described in the article.  This is a real protection, albeit not against the most common threat.<br>
<p>
Of course, you might be able to achieve the same safety using BIOS settings that require a password to modify those settings themselves and disable booting from external media, and you lock the box itself with an alarm system (to keep bad guys from removing the hard disk and sticking it in another computer to modify its contents).  But that seems a bit more complicated, to me, than just having a chip on the motherboard that stores checksums.<br>

Then there's no point in verifying checksums except at start-up.  The code to do so can either go in the firmware/BIOS, or run in the kernel on boot.  The on-line checks may be valuable for detecting errors, but not attacks.

      Except that it'd be horrifically expensive to checksum the entire system at startup.  It looks like this approach would allow a trusted startup without having to check everything.<br>

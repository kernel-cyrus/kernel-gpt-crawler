           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 7, 2015</br>
           </div>
Waiting for events in an operating system is an activity that
is fraught with hazards; without a great deal of care, it is easy to miss
the event that is being waited for.  The result can be an infinite wait â€”
an outcome which tends to be unpopular with users.  The kernel has long
since buried 
the relevant code in the core kernel with the idea that, with the right
API, wait-related race conditions can be avoided.  Recent experience shows,
though, that the situation is not always quite that simple.
<p>
Many years ago, kernel code that needed to wait for an event would execute
something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    while (!condition)
 	sleep_on(&amp;wait_queue);
</pre>
<p>
The problem with this code is that, should the condition become true
between the test in the <tt>while</tt> loop and the call to
<tt>sleep_on()</tt>, the wakeup could be lost and the sleep would last
forever.  For this reason, <tt>sleep_on()</tt> was deprecated for a long
time and no longer exists in the kernel.
<p>
The contemporary pattern looks more like this:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_WAIT(wait);

    while (1) {
    	prepare_to_wait(&amp;queue, &amp;wait, state);
    	if (condition)
	    break;
	schedule();
    }
    finish_wait(&amp;queue, &amp;wait);
</pre>
<p>

Here, <tt>prepare_to_wait()</tt> will enqueue the thread on the given
<tt>queue</tt> and put it into the given execution <tt>state</tt>, which is
usually either <tt>TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE</tt> or
<tt>TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE</tt>.  Normally, that state will cause the thread
to block once it calls <tt>schedule()</tt>.  If the wakeup happens first,
though, the process state will be set back to <tt>TASK_RUNNING</tt> and
<tt>schedule()</tt> will return immediately (or, at least, as soon as it
decides this thread should run again).  So, regardless of the timing
of events, this code should work properly.  The numerous variants of the
<tt>wait_event()</tt> macro expand into a similar sequence of calls.
<p>
Signs of trouble can be found in messages like the following, which are
turning up on systems running the 3.19-rc kernels:
<p>
<pre>
     do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1
     	set at [&lt;ffffffff910a0f7a&gt;] prepare_to_wait+0x2a/0x90
</pre>
<p>
This message, the result of some new checks added for 3.19, is indicating
that a thread is performing an action that could block while it is
ostensibly already in a sleeping state.  One might wonder how that can be,
but it is not that hard to understand in the light of the sleeping code
above.
<p>
The "<tt>condition</tt>" checked in that code is often a function call;
that function may perform a fair amount of processing on its own.  It may
need to acquire locks to properly check for the wakeup condition.  That, of
course, is where the trouble comes in.  Should the condition-checking
function call something like <tt>mutex_lock()</tt>, it will go into a new
version of the going-to-sleep code, changing the task state.  That, of
course, may well interfere with the outer sleeping code.  For this reason,
nesting of sleeping primitives in this way is discouraged; the new warning
was added to point the finger at code performing this kind of nesting.  It
turns out that kind of nesting happens rather more often than the scheduler
developers would have liked.
<p>
So what is a developer to do if the need arises to take locks while
checking the sleep condition?  <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/61ada528dea028331e99e8ceaed87c683ad25de2">One
solution</a> was added in 3.19; it takes the form of a
new pattern that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_WAIT_FUNC(wait, woken_wait_function);

    add_wait_queue(&amp;queue, &amp;wait);
    while (1) {
	if (condition)
	    break;
	wait_woken(&amp;wait, state, timeout);
    }
    remove_wait_queue(&amp;queue, &amp;wait);
</pre>
<p>

The new <tt>wait_woken()</tt> function encapsulates most of the logic
needed to wait for a wakeup.  At a first glance, though, it looks like it
would suffer from the same problem as <tt>sleep_on()</tt>: what happens if
the wakeup comes between the condition test and the <tt>wait_woken()</tt>
call?  The key here is in the use of a special wakeup function called
<tt>woken_wait_function()</tt>.  The <tt>DEFINE_WAIT_FUNC()</tt> macro at
the top of the above code sequence associates this function with the wait
queue entry, changing what happens when the wakeup arrives.
<p>
In particular, that change causes a special flag (<tt>WQ_FLAG_WOKEN</tt>)
to be set in the <tt>flags</tt> field of the wait queue entry.  If
<tt>wait_woken()</tt> sees that flag, it knows that the wakeup already
occurred and doesn't block.  Otherwise, the wakeup has not occurred, so
<tt>wait_woken()</tt> can safely call <tt>schedule()</tt> to wait.
<p>
This pattern solves the problem, but there is a catch: every place in the
kernel that might be using nested sleeping primitives needs to be found and
changed.  There are a <i>lot</i> of places to look for problems and
potentially fix, and the fix is not an easy, mechanical change.  It would
be nicer to come up with a version of <tt>wait_event()</tt> that doesn't
suffer from this problem in the first place or, failing that, with
something new that can be easily substituted for <tt>wait_event()</tt>
calls. 
<p>
Kent Overstreet <a href="/Articles/628632/">thinks he has that
replacement</a> in the form of the "closure" primitive used in the bcache
subsystem.  Closures work in a manner similar to <tt>wait_woken()</tt> in
that the wakeup state is stored internally to the relevant data structure;
in this case, though, an atomic reference count is used.  Interested
readers can see <a
href="/Articles/628633/"><tt>drivers/md/bcache/closure.h</tt></a> and <a
href="/Articles/628634/"><tt>closure.c</tt></a> for the details.  Scheduler
developer Peter Zijlstra <a href="/Articles/628635/">is not convinced</a>
about the closure code, but he agrees that it would be nice to have a
better solution.
<p>
The form of that solution is thus unclear at this point.  What does seem
clear is that the current nesting of sleeping primitives needs to be
fixed.  So, one way or another, we are likely to see a fair amount of work
going into finding and changing problematic calls over the next few
development cycles.  Until that work is finished, warnings from the new
debugging code are likely to be a common event.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Possibly because this code example is normally in a macro so the condition is re-evaluated - hence you have to watch for the expansion of 'condition' vs precedence of the logical not.
</p>
<p>
Of course, some extra brackets can fix that:
</p>
<pre>
while (!(condition)) {
	wait_woken(&amp;wait, state, timeout);
}
</pre>
<p>
Other than that, perhaps there was some compiler that adds instructions for the extra operator, though I'd hope any optimiser should be able to efficiently write the loop from either style.

Probably because it was a smaller change from the previous version with prepare_to_wait(), and therefore easier to review. Also, when the condition is a function with (temporary) side effects, it can be easier to discuss the former than the latter, just in terms of having separate lines for the "while" keyword and the condition text when proposing potential races.<br>
<p>
If you were writing new code with a simple condition, the latter would be better, except that you'd use prepare_to_wait() in that case anyway.<br>

      This from an erstwhile real-time programmer with very limited knowledge of the kernel:
<br><br>
Why the problem in
<pre>
    	if (condition)
	    break;
	schedule();
</pre>?
<br>
If the condition is raised between <tt>if (condition)</tt> and <tt>schedule()</tt>, why isn't it still there to be caught the next time?  Is it that some other process/thread is checking on <tt>condition</tt>, and may snag it erroneously?
<br><br>
If someone could enlighten me why <tt>condition</tt> wouldn't be waiting around for pickup at the next test, I'd be appreciative.

Because code doesn't just call schedule() - it changes the task state to something other than TASK_RUNNING, so that once they call schedule() the scheduler won't run them a second time until someone else wakes them up.<br>
<p>
If you change that to<br>
<p>
if (condition)<br>
        break;<br>
set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUTIBLE);<br>
schedule();<br>
<p>
what happens if the condition becoming true and the wakeup happens after checking the condition, but before setting the task state? See the issue?<br>
<p>
The solution is to set the task state to TASK_UNINTERRUTIBLE _before_ checking the condition. Then if the wakeup comes between checking the condition and the schedule(), the task state still gets set back to TASK_RUNNING and the task won't sleep forever.<br>

When I tried writing out a nested version, I didn't find any actual problems, presuming that the condition code never goes to sleep after it looks at something that could affect the outcome. The outer sleep code's wakeup could inappropriately abort the inner sleep for a cycle, but when the inner sleep is done, the outer condition code would determine that it shouldn't sleep.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, you could be sleeping in the condition code after collecting some data that will ultimately lead to deciding not to wake up, and that data changing could lead to a missed wakeup (since the outer wakeup got discarded and you will go to sleep in the outer schedule() anyway). The only reason I can think of that this would happen is if someone wanted to compare two values, each accessed under a different lock, without nesting the locks either way, which can't be very common. On the other hand, it's impractical to determine automatically whether a particular place is safe or not.<br>

Here is the current wait_woken code(v4.13). What if the wakeup comes between "if (!(wq_entry-&gt;flags &amp; WQ_FLAG_WOKEN) &amp;&amp; !is_kthread_should_stop())" and "timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);"? In this case it seems we also sleep forever.<br>

        set_current_state(mode); /* A */                                             <br>

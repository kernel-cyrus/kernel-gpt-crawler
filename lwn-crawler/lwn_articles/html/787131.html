           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 1, 2019</br>
           <hr>

</div>
The 2019 version of the Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management
Summit opened with a plenary talk by Brendan Gregg on observing the state
of Linux systems using BPF.  It is, he said, an exciting time;  the
BPF-based "superpowers" being added to the kernel are growing in capability and
maturity.  It is now possible to ask many questions about what is happening
in a production Linux system without the need for  kernel modifications or
even  basic debugging information.
<p>
Gregg started with a demonstration tool that he had just written: it's
immediate manifestation was in the creation of a high-pitched tone that
varied in frequency as he walked around the lectern.  It was, it turns out,
a BPF-based tool that extracts the signal strength of the laptop's WiFi
connection 
from the kernel and creates a noise in response.  As he interfered with
that signal with his body, the strength (and thus the pitch of the tone)
varied.  By tethering the laptop to his phone, he used the tool to measure
how close he was to the laptop.  It may not be the most practical tool, but
it did demonstrate how BPF can be used to do unexpected things.
<p>
Gregg works at Netflix, a company that typically operates about 150,000 server
instances.  Naturally, Netflix cares a lot about performance; that leads to
a desire for observability tools that can help to pinpoint the source of
performance problems.  But the value of good tools goes beyond just
performance tuning.
<p>
<h4>Better bug reports</h4>
<p>
For example, the company is currently trying to move its server images
forward to the 
4.15 kernel, but a snag has come up.  There is a log-rotation service that
waits for a specific process to exit by repeatedly running <tt>ps</tt>.  It
seems like a simple task, but it started failing on the newer kernel;
<tt>ps</tt> would fail to report the process when, in fact, that process
was still running.  It was, Gregg said, time to investigate.
<p>
He began with the <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace"><tt>bpftrace</tt></a> tool
which, he said, is soon to be
packaged by a number of distributors.  It could be interesting, he thought,
to see which system calls are failing under the new kernel that worked
under the old.  Finding out which system calls are failing can be done with
a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    bpftrace -e 't:syscalls:sys_exit_* /comm == "ps"/ \
    	     { @[probe, args-&gt;ret &gt; 0 ? 0 : - args-&gt;ret] = count(); }'
</pre>
<p>
This has to attach to all 316 system calls, so it takes a while to get
going; there is talk of a "multi-attach" functionality to speed things up
in the future.  In the meantime, one can get around that problem by
changing the command to attach to the
raw system-call tracepoint instead:
<p>
<pre>
    bpftrace -e 't:raw_syscalls:sys_exit /comm == "ps"/ \
    	      {@[args-&gt;id, args-&gt;ret &gt; 0 ? 0 : - args-&gt;ret] = count(); } '
</pre>
<p>

<div class="tlr">Gregg posted a lot of code in this session, most of which
has not been reproduced here.  See <a
href="http://www.brendangregg.com/Slides/LSFMM2019_BPF_Observability.pdf">his
slides</a> for the full details.
</div>

That works more quickly, at the cost of reporting system-call numbers
rather than names.
This command did, indeed, turn up one extra failure that was happening
under the new kernel, but it turned out to have nothing to do with the
problem â€” a dead end.  So it was time to shift tactics: perhaps some
system call was "successfully failing".  A couple more <tt>bpftrace</tt>
commands later, he had an answer: occasionally the <tt>getdents()</tt>
system call will return a partial result on <tt>/proc</tt>, causing the
entry for the target process to be left out.  
<p>
So, perhaps, the problem lives in the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem.  Switching
to an ftrace-based tool for a moment, he looked at which functions were
being called in the failed runs.  Then back to <tt>bpftrace</tt> to chase a
few wrong leads before determining that <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/pid.c#L449"><tt>find_ge_pid()</tt></a>,
which is 
supposed to continue a read by finding the next highest process ID, was
stopping early.  That, in turn, appears to have been caused by a change in
the implementation of the process-ID table.  And at that point he had to
stop to travel to the conference.
<p>
He thus didn't yet have a solution to the problem (though, since the guilty
parties were in the room, a solution seems likely to come soon).  But, he
said, even at this point BPF has helped to significantly narrow down the
problem.  One of the biggest benefits to the current crop of BPF-based
observability tools, he said, is that they enable the creation of much
better bug reports.
<p>
<h4>One-liners</h4>
<p>
Stepping back briefly, Gregg talked about the architecture of the BPF
system.  At the lowest level is the BPF virtual machine itself.  One can
write raw BPF code for this machine, but it's "super hard" and nobody
should do it.  He asked the people in the audience who had done this to
raise their hands and was surprised by how many hands went up; the room
contained, he said, the entire world population of raw BPF experts.  For
those wanting a higher-level experience, though, an LLVM backend allows BPF
programs to be written in a restricted version of C.  Then, the BCC system
allows those programs to be loaded and driven from C or Python code.
And now, above that, is 
<tt>bpftrace</tt>, which allows the writing of useful one-line tools.
<p>
So, for example, he asked about the effectiveness of readahead in the page
cache: is it actually accelerating I/O, or is it just polluting the cache?  One
need not wonder about such things; they can now be observed.  So he wrote a
simple tool in <tt>bpftrace</tt> to record timestamps for all pages brought
in via readahead; it then compares the timestamps when those pages are actually

<a href="/Articles/787181/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/BrendanGregg-sm.jpg" alt="[Brendan Gregg]"
title="Brendan Gregg" class="rthumb"></a>

referenced.  The result, for his workload, was that almost all pages were
accessed within 32ms of being read into the cache; the number of pages that
were never referenced was quite small.  So readahead is indeed helping
here; if anything, the application in 
question could benefit from even more readahead.

<p>
One can ask similar questions about eviction from the page cache: by looking at
the age of pages as they are pushed out, it is possible to evaluate whether
the page 
cache is appropriately sized.  If those pages have not been referenced in a
long time, perhaps the cache is too large.
This tool does not yet exist but, he
suggested, perhaps the assembled group could put an implementation together
during the conference and send it to him.
<p>
The tool to answer the readahead question was not quite a one-liner, but it fit
nicely onto a single slide.  <tt>bpftrace</tt>, he said, is a great
platform for the creation of short tools.  In its simplest form, one need
only provide a probe (a kernel tracepoint, for example), an optional filter
expression, and an action to take when the probe is hit.  The language
overall, he said, looks a lot like awk or DTrace.
<p>
Inside, it has a parser
that builds an abstract syntax tree describing the task, which is then used
to create the BPF program(s) to attach to the events of interest.  The perf
ring buffer is used to get high-bandwidth data out of the kernel but, to
the greatest extent possible, data is boiled down in kernel space first and
exported via BPF maps.  Version 0.90 was released in March; the next
release, called 0.10, is due soon (though that release number may be
changed after some 
complaints were raised about the apparent backward number jump).
<p>
<h4>BPF everywhere</h4>
<p>
As Gregg works on a book about performance analysis with BPF, he is trying
to fill in various "observability gaps" in the system.  To that end, he
brought back his old <tt>superping</tt> utility, which hooked into packet
send and receive events in an attempt to obtain more accurate ping times by
eliminating any scheduling latency.  But he ended up reporting longer times
than ordinary <tt>ping</tt> does â€” not the expected result.  It turns out
that this problem has been
solved in the networking stack years ago, with timestamps being stored in
the packets themselves, so this tool proved unnecessary.  The
<tt>superping</tt> tool demonstrates, though, how BPF programs can work
from kernel headers to walk through chains of structures.
<p>
A tool that is still useful, instead, is called <a
href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-11-30/linux-bcc-tcplife.html"><tt>tcplife</tt></a>;
it collects information about TCP connections to and from the local system.
This kind 
of data is normally generated through packet capture, which is an expensive
thing to do; <tt>tcplife</tt>, instead, just hooks into the networking
stack to get events when connections begin and end.  Initially it used a
kprobe set on <tt>tcp_set_state()</tt>; that information proved useful
enough that a proper tracepoint was added in 4.15.  That was an
improvement; tracepoints are more stable and less prone to breaking than
kprobes.  But only to a point.
<p>
In 4.16, that tracepoint was moved to <tt>inet_sock_set_state()</tt> and
some more information was added to it; that broke all of Gregg's tools that
were using the older tracepoint.  And, he said, he is "fine with that".
Even if a tracepoint changes occasionally, it's far better than using raw
kprobes.  He did have one request, though: tracepoints should include a
direct pointer to the structure(s) in use at that location in the code.  He
realizes that any code using that pointer will be unstable, but it's still
useful to have if there is a need for data that is not exported directly by
the tracepoint.
<p>
This case illustrates a more general point, he said: kprobes can serve as a
useful way to prototype tracepoints.  A tool built around a kprobe shows
what the use case for the tracepoint would be and which data should be
included; that helps to justify the tracepoint's addition and to get it
right when that happens.
<p>
Gregg concluded with a "reality check": even though the various BPF tools
provide all kinds of useful information, most performance wins still come
from poring over flame graphs instead.  But, naturally, BPF is moving into
that area as well; it is now possible to create trace summaries in the
kernel, reducing the overhead of collecting that sort of performance data.
That, he said, shows the direction the kernel community should continue to
take in the future: "BPF all the things".<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

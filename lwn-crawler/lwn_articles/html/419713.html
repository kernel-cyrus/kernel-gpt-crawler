           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 13, 2010</br>
           </div>
Virtualization places some interesting demands on the host system, many of
which are related to memory management.  When two agents within the system
both believe that they are in charge of memory, interesting conflicts are
bound to arise.  A recent patch from Balbir Singh shows the kind of effort
which is being made to address these conflicts, but it also gives a hint at
how a more ambitious effort might really solve the problem.
<p>
The Linux page cache keeps copies of pages from on-disk files in main
memory in the hopes of avoiding I/O operations when those pages are
accessed.  At any given time, the page cache can easily account for more
than half of the system's total memory usage.  The actual size of the page
cache varies over time; as other types of memory use (kernel memory and
anonymous pages) grow, the page cache shrinks to make room.  Balancing the
demands of the page cache with other memory users can be a challenge, but
Linux seems to get it close to right most of the time.
<p>
Balbir's <a href="/Articles/419564/">patch</a> is intended to give the
system administrator a bit more control over page cache usage; to that end,
it provides a new boot-time parameter (<tt>unmapped_page_control</tt>)
which sets an upper bound on the number of unmapped pages in the cache.
"Unmapped" pages are those which are not mapped into any process's address
space - they do not appear in any page tables.  Unmapped pages arguably
have a lower chance of being needed in the near future; they are also a bit
easier for the system to get rid of.  This patch thus gives the system
administrator a relatively easy way to minimize page cache memory usage.
<p>
The obvious question is: why?  Page cache pages will be reclaimed anyway if
the system has other needs for the memory, so there would seem to be little
point in shrinking it prematurely.  The problem, it seems, is
virtualization.  When a process on a virtualized system reads a page from a
file, the guest operating system will dutifully store a copy of that page
in its page cache.  The actual read operation, though, will be passed
through to (and executed by) the host, which will also store a copy in its
page cache.  So the page gets cached twice - perhaps even more times if it
is used by multiple virtual machines.  Caching a page can be a good thing,
but caching multiple copies is likely to be too much of a good thing.
<p>
So what Balbir's patch is doing can be explained this way: it is forcibly
cleaning copies of pages out of guest page caches to minimize duplicate
copies.  The memory freed in this way can be captured by a balloon driver
and returned to the host, making it available for more productive use
elsewhere in the system.
<p>
This technique should clearly improve the situation.  Less duplication is
good, and, if the guest ends up needing some of the freed pages, those
pages stand a good chance of being found in the host's page cache.  But one
can't help but wonder if it might not be an overly indirect approach.
Rather than forcibly reclaim pages from the guests' caches, might it be
better to have all of the systems share the same page cache?   A single,
unified page cache could be managed to maximize the performance of the
system as a whole; that should yield better results than managing a number
of seemingly independent page caches.
<p>
Virtualization based on containers has exactly this type of unified page
cache since all of the containers are running on the same kernel.  That may
be one of the reasons why containers are seen to perform better than fully
virtualized systems.  Bringing a shared page cache to the virtualized world
would be a bit of a challenge, though, which probably has a lot to do with
why it has not already been done.
<p>
To begin with, there would be some clear security issues.  A virtualized
system should be unable to access any resources which have not been
explicitly provided to it.  Any sort of shared page cache would have to be
designed in a way which would leave the host in control of which pages are
visible to each guest.  In practice, that would probably mean using the
virtualized block drivers which make filesystems available to virtualized
guests now.  Rather than "read" a page into a page controlled by the guest,
the driver could somehow just map the host's copy of the page into the
guest's address space.
<p>
Making that work correctly would require the addition of a significant new,
Linux-only API between the host and the guest.  It would be hard to do it
in a way which maintained any sort of illusion that the guest is running on
hardware of its own.  Such a scheme would complicate memory management in
the guest - hardware is increasingly dynamic, but individual pages of
memory still do not come and go spontaneously.  A shared page cache would
also frustrate attempts to use huge pages for guest memory.
<p>
In other words, the difficulties of sharing the page cache between hosts
and guests look to be decidedly nontrivial.  It is not surprising that we
are still living in a world where scarce memory pages can be soaked up with
duplicate copies of data.  As long as that situation holds, there will be a
place for patches which cause guests to behave in ways which are more
friendly to the system as a whole.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's not only possible, but trivial: IO from guests goes through the hypervisor, which can use simple uncached file IO (e.g., O_DIRECT) to service these requests. Host IO goes through the normal path and uses normal buffering.<br>

KSM today deduplicates pages between guests and not between guest and host. One of the future TODOs is to look at KSM as well, but dealing with anonymous pages as KSM does today is very different from dealing with anonymous (guest cache as seen by the host) and page cache as seen by the host is not a trivial task.<br>

It seems like this could be much easier, at least for the read-only page case and work similarly to the page merging stuff. If the IO driver does DMA then rather then actually copying data from the virtual hardware into the page the host's page containing that data and the guests page that should contain the data could get merged. If either writes to the page, it splits.<br>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>November 16, 2011</br>
           </div>
<p>
Back in June, we <a href="/Articles/448505/">looked</a> at a proposed
mechanism for adding aliases to device names, disks in particular.  Since
then, the patch has been merged into the mainline, but some kernel
developers are not happy with that and have asked that it be reverted.  Part of the
complaint is that the functionality adds to the kernel ABI, which will need
to be maintained "forever", but there are other solutions to the problem
that don't require kernel changes.  So far, the patch has not been
reverted, but there is an underlying question: who gets to decide when and
where to extend the kernel's ABI?
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a72c5e5eb738033938ab30d6a634b74d1d060f10">alias
patch</a> was authored by Nao Nishijima and came into the mainline (for
3.2-rc1) by way
of James Bottomley's SCSI tree.  The patch allows administrators to
associate an alias name for a particular disk by writing to the
<tt>/sys/block/&lt;disk&gt;/alias</tt> sysfs file.  That way, certain log
messages can be made using the user-supplied disk name rather than the raw
name of the disk, which may change on each boot.

<p>
Tejun Heo  
<a
href="/Articles/467573/">requested</a> that the patch be reverted, noting that it "<q>has been nacked by people working on device driver core, block
layer and kernel-userland interface and shouldn't have been
upstreamed</q>". That request was quickly acked by several people (Greg
Kroah-Hartman, Kay Sievers, Jens Axboe, and Jeff Garzik), with Axboe
explicitly noting that it should be done soon: "<q>We need to
revert it before 3.2 rolls out, otherwise we are stuck with it.</q>"
</p>

<p>
As might be guessed, though, Bottomley <a
href="/Articles/467584/">disagreed</a> that it should be reverted, saying
that it solved a real 
problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
No, I can't agree with this ... if you propose a working alternative,
I'm listening, but in the absence of one, I think the hack fills a gap
we have in log analysis and tides us over until we have an agreed on
proper solution (at which point, I'm perfectly happy to pull the hack
back out).
</div>
</p>

<p>
Several folks pounced on the "hack" admission in Bottomley's note, but
both Kroah-Hartman and Sievers believe that there is no need for a
kernel-side solution at all.  As Sievers <a href="/Articles/467586/">put
it</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote">
The solution to this problem is to let udev log the known symlinks to
the log stream at device discovery time. That way you can log _all_
kernel device messages to the currently [known] disk names. This works
already even on old systems,
</div>
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/467590/">pointed out</a> that
Nishijima recognizes that it can be solved in user space: "<q>Again, this is fixable in userspace, the author of the patch agrees with
that, yet refuses to make the userspace changes despite having a few
_years_ in which to so so</q>". As with the others commenting,
Sievers is also concerned about adding to the user-space interface:
"<q>Such hacks are not supposed to get in, and its really hard to get
them 
out again.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
While the patch has not been reverted, Nishijima may be anticipating that
outcome with a <a href="/Articles/467603/">post</a> that looks at changes
to udev: "<q>I understood why this patch is not acceptable and would like to
solve the problem of the device name mismatch in *user space* using
udev</q>".  Kroah-Hartman suggests posting udev patches that implement
the changes to the linux-hotplug
mailing list as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
It would seem that Bottomley made something of an end-run
around the objections of various maintainers by pulling the change into his
tree. His reasons for doing so make sense, because there are
customers asking for the change, but it still routes around the usual
paths. Heo's request certainly indicates that he doesn't believe it came
in 
via the proper path, and Kroah-Hartman is blunt about that as well:
"<q>Also, you should have gotten this through the block layer
maintainer...</q>". It <i>is</i> a hack as everyone seems to agree, but
it's a hack that leaves behind an ABI for the kernel to maintain
forevermore.  It is not surprising that a number of core developers would
like to see it reverted.

This can't be the argument to end all others though, or Andrew Tannenbaum would have won his famous debate with Linus Torvalds.<br>

It is not.  In fact, most subsystem maintainers pay very little attention to such arguments when the kernel change being proposed is not a hack, is reasonably contained, and has no long-term consequences worth of notice.<br>
<p>
However, a new ABI that lots of people disagree with _is_ a long-term consequence worth of notice, and getting it in with so many outstanding NACKs doesn't make it any more palatable.<br>

I look forward to seeing a fully supportable Enterprise acceptable solution that doesn't involve a kernel patch or changing half of userspace. Meanwhile, I fully expect the "solution" forced upon the world+dog will be to change many userspace utilities now to deal with discovering the device name from wherever udev stashes it (or symlinks, or logs to the Journal, or whatever). And that is going to be a nightmare for supporting real customers in the real world who want to know what device they are working with when they get messages from utilities. Oh well.<br>

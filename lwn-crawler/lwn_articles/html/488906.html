<p>
The "integrity" of a Linux system is based on whether it is running the
code that the administrator expects.  If not, a compromise of the system
may have occurred.  The Linux integrity subsystem is meant to detect
those unexpected changes to files in order to protect systems against
compromise.  That is done by creating integrity "measurements" (hashes of
contents and metadata) of files of interest.

<p>
Much of what is needed to do integrity management has already landed in
the mainline, but there are a few remaining pieces.  
The integrity
measurement 
architecture (IMA) appraisal extension <a href="/Articles/487700/">patch set</a>
from Mimi Zohar and Dmitry Kasatkin fills in one missing piece: storing and
validating the integrity measurement of files.  
A hash of a file's contents and metadata will be stored in the <tt>security.ima</tt>
extended attribute (xattr) of the file, and the patch set will create and
maintain those xattrs.
In addition, it can enforce that the file contents are "correct" when the file is opened for reading or executing based on
the 
integrity values that were stored.
</p>

<p>
The integrity subsystem has taken a rather twisted path into the kernel.
It was <a href="/Articles/137306/">proposed</a> as far back as 2005, but
the subsystem has been broken up into smaller pieces several times along
the way.  Much of IMA was added to the kernel in 2.6.30, but another piece,
the <a href="/Articles/394170/">extended verification module</a> (EVM) was
not merged until 3.2.  Digital signature support was added to EVM in 3.3,
and IMA appraisal is currently under review.
</p>

<p>
As described on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linux-ima/index.php?title=Main_Page">Linux
IMA web page</a>, the integrity subsystem is meant to thwart various kinds
of attacks against the contents of files, both on- and off-line.  Unexpected
changes to files, particularly executables, may be a sign that the system
has been compromised.  In addition, the subsystem allows the use of the
"Trusted Platform Module" (TPM) to collect integrity measurements and sign
them in such a way that the system can "attest" to its integrity.  That
attestation could be sent to another system to "prove" that the system is
intact&mdash;only approved code is running.
</p>

<p>
Current kernels can generate an integrity measurement of files that are
executed, collect and digitally sign them with keys from the
TPM (or the kernel keyring), and use that information for remote
attestation.  EVM adds the ability to thwart offline attacks against the
file contents or metadata by hashing the values of the security xattrs of
the file (e.g. <tt>security.selinux</tt>, <tt>security.ima</tt>), signing
that hash, and storing it as <tt>security.evm</tt>.
</p>

<p>
But, there is nothing in place that would stop a running system from
executing or reading a file that has been changed. If a file with an IMA
hash is opened for reading or executing, the appraisal extension will
check to see if the contents match the stored hash.  If they don't match,
the <tt>ima_appraise</tt> 
kernel command-line parameter determines what happens.  If it is set to
"enforce", access to the file is denied, while "fix" will update the IMA
xattr with the new value.  In addition, "off" can be used to turn off any
file appraisal.
</p>

<p>
In order to recognize that a file has changed while it is open, the
appraisal extension 
requires the filesystem to support <tt>i_version</tt>, which is a counter
that gets incremented any time the file's inode gets updated.  Filesystems
must be mounted with <tt>i_version</tt> option in order for the appraisal
extension to work.  That allows the extension to notice the change when the
file is closed and either update the xattr or
flag the file change as a policy violation.

<p>
In order to get the initial <tt>security.ima</tt> xattrs
on files that are to be appraised (by default, all files owned by root),
one boots the kernel with <tt>ima_appraise_tcb</tt> (which enables
appraisal) and 
<tt>ima_appraise=fix</tt>, and then by opening all files of interest (e.g. via
a <tt>find</tt> command as <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linux-ima/index.php?title=Main_Page#Labeling_the_filesystem_with_.27security.ima.27_extended_attributes">suggested</a>
on the IMA web page).  
</p>

<p>
The IMA appraisal extension will complete the off-line attack detection
that EVM provides.  Because the extension will create and maintain 
the <tt>security.ima</tt> xattr, 
EVM will be able to detect changes to the file contents.  
</p>

<p>
In response to an earlier version of the patch set, James Morris <a href="/Articles/489115/">asked</a> if
there were any distributions that were planning to use IMA and EVM once all
the pieces are in place.  George Wilson said that IBM plans to use it
internally once distributions have incorporated it.  In addition, Ryan Ware
and Kasatkin said that the Tizen mobile distribution plans to use it for
some product profiles. 
</p>

<p>
But, before any of that can happen, the appraisal extension needs to find a
way to change its locking behavior to get past a <a
href="/Articles/489117/">NAK by Al Viro</a>. 
In the current patches,
the final <tt>__fput()</tt> is deferred if a file is closed before
<tt>munmap()</tt> 
is called in kernels using IMA appraisal.  Viro is concerned that this
changes the locking 
conditions based 
on whether the kernel is using IMA or not, which may make locking
problems harder to spot.  He also said that the overhead is too high for a
commonly used path, and that not all of the places where <tt>__fput()</tt>
is used were covered by the patch.
So far, no solution to the problem has been
found, though Viro did <a href="/Articles/489124/">suggest</a> possibly
using a different mutex for changing xattrs, but that it would take a fair
amount of code review to 
determine if that could be done.
</p>

<p>
Given that the patch set completes a job started by EVM, and will, for the
most part, complete the integrity subsystem, it seems likely that a
solution will be found.  There are a few lingering pieces of IMA
appraisal that are still coming, according to the <a
href="http://downloads.sf.net/project/linux-ima/linux-ima/Integrity_overview.pdf">"An
Overview of the Linux Integrity Subsystem [PDF]" white paper</a>.  Two
specific pieces are mentioned, one to add digital signature capabilities
for vendor-signed files, and another that will protect directory contents
(e.g. filenames).  While the currently proposed patches may still need some
work before they can be considered for the mainline, those working on the
integrity subsystem are probably finally starting to see the light at the
end of a long
tunnel.

No. Demand-loaded executables have always worked by mmap()ing the executable then relying on normal paging to load it into memory. The mmap()ed executable cannot be overwritten while someone has it open (any attempt returns one of -EBUSY or -ETXTBSY, though for some time this did not apply to shared libraries, so attempts to overwrite those caused segfaults, whoops). And, of course, the usual rules apply to unlink()-and-recreate: the old file is still accessed by the users who have it open.<br>

I think the concern was more along the lines that you have to read the entire file into memory to verify the hash before you can use any of the data safely. Filesystems with data checksumming generally hash each block separately (with a Merkle tree or similar to link the hashes together at the inode level), but the article seemed to imply just one hash per file.<br>

If so, that would make initial loading of binaries slower (a lot slower for big binaries), but would not preclude use of demand paging after startup.<br>

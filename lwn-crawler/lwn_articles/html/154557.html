The device model/sysfs "class" subsystem is a mechanism which allows
different kernel subsystems to export device-independent interfaces to user
space.  With a recent kernel, a number of interesting class hierarchies
can be found.  For example, <tt>/sys/class/net</tt> represents all of the
network interfaces in the system, <tt>/sys/class/sound</tt> shows the audio
devices, and <tt>/sys/class/graphics</tt> can be used to find frame
buffers.
<p>

The class API has changed little since it was documented in <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/31370/">this LWN driver porting article</a>.
Kernel code registers a <tt>class</tt> structure to create a directory in
<tt>/sys/class</tt>, then populates it with <tt>class_device</tt> objects.
This API has worked for some time, but it has its limitations; it forces a
two-level class-&gt;device structure which is unable to represent all of
the relevant data structures in the kernel.  For many class hierarchies,
such as the network device class tree shown in the diagram to the right,
two levels is sufficient.  Other subsystems, however, have had trouble with
this limitation.
<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/class-block.png" width=342 height=125
alt="[Block class diagram]" border=0 hspace=2 align="left">

Consider, for example, the block subsystem, as represented by the
simplified diagram to the left.  The block subsystem deals in block
devices, of course, and those are represented in the second layer of the
diagram.  Each block device, however, can contain partitions, which are
(virtual) block devices in their own right.  Putting all of those
partitions in the 
top layer of the block class hierarchy would lose the relationship between
those partitions and the physical devices where they live; the deeper
hierarchy truly does make sense.  There are also other 
objects, such as the request queue, which need to be present in the class
tree.  The fact that the class
subsystem cannot represent this structure is one of the reasons why the
block layer has its own sysfs subtree, under <tt>/sys/block</tt>, even
though it logically belongs under <tt>/sys/class</tt>.
<p>

This issue recently came to a head when Dmitry Torokhov reworked the input
subsystem to make use of sysfs.  The input class tree also fails to
fit neatly into the class subsystem, though for slightly different
reasons.  The input layer can export multiple interfaces to the same
device; a touch screen can show up as a serial device, as an event
generator, or as a mouse, for example.  Even a straightforward mouse can
appear by itself, or as part of the multiplexed "mice" device.
<p>

As a way of representing the structure of the input subsystem, Dmitry
implemented a "subclass" mechanism.  Various objections to the
implementation were raised, however, and Greg Kroah-Hartman went off to
design a solution he liked better.  His <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/153697/">patch</a> has now been posted for
review; it is also part of the -mm tree.
<p>

Greg's solution does not involve subclasses at all; instead, the
<tt>class_device</tt> structure has acquired a new <tt>parent</tt> field.
The function which creates <tt>class_device</tt> structures has a new
prototype:
<p>
<pre>
    struct class_device *class_device_create(struct class *cls,
					     struct class_device *parent,
					     dev_t devt,
					     struct device *device, 
					     char *fmt, ...);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>parent</tt> argument is new.  If it is non-<tt>NULL</tt>, the new
<tt>class_device</tt> will be placed under the parent <tt>class_device</tt>
in sysfs, rather than directly under the class itself.  Needless to say,
this change breaks all users of the class subsystem; if it goes into the
mainline, all out-of-tree code using classes will have to be updated.
<p>
This interface should work reasonably well in the block case, where
partitions can truly be thought of as child devices.  Dmitry is <a
href="/Articles/154562/">less pleased with it</a> for the input subsystem,
however.  He would like to be able to set up different hotplug handlers for
lower-level entries, but, since those handlers are set up at the class
level, an implementation without subclasses does not provide that
capability.  There are other objections as well; the parent mechanism makes
it a little harder to set up the sort of hierarchy Dmitry would like to
create, for example.
<p>

As of this writing, there has been no further discussion of the interface.
There is a distinct chance that it could change before it makes its way
into the mainline.  In one way or another, however, support for a deeper
<tt>/sys/class</tt> is likely to be merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

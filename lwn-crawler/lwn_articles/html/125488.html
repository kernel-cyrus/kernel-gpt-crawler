As has been described in <a href="/Articles/106177/">previous Kernel Page
articles</a>, the Linux kernel works with a four-level, hierarchical page
table mechanism.  A virtual address is translated to a physical address by
walking down the table until the relevant page table entry is found.  When
running on hardware which does not implement a four-level tree, the kernel
transparently "folds" the missing layers out of existence.  So the same
high-level memory management code runs on all hardware, regardless of the
depth of page table tree that hardware implements.
<p>

There is one interesting issue with this scheme: not all hardware uses this
sort of hierarchical page table mechanism.  It matches the i386 hardware well
- to the point that the processor works directly from the same page tables
that the generic kernel memory management code manipulates.  Other
processors have different ways of handling address translation, however.
The ia-64 architecture uses a linear page table which is, itself, mapped in
virtual memory; there is a "virtual hashed page table walker" hardware
function which can quickly resolve page faults in many situations.  The
hierarchical page tables carefully maintained by the core kernel are never
used directly by the hardware; instead, the architecture-specific code
takes care of moving information between the core kernel tables and the
hardware versions.  This impedance matching requires extra code and work;
it also makes it harder to take advantage of any high-level features that
the hardware may offer.
<p>
(See <a
href="http://www.phptr.com/articles/article.asp?p=29961&seqNum=4">this
chapter from <i>ia-64 Linux Kernel</i></a> for a detailed description of
how the ia-64 architecture handles page tables).
<p>

Christoph Lameter would like to get rid of the disconnect between in-kernel
and hardware page tables; to that end, he has proposed <a
href="/Articles/124961/">a new abstraction layer</a> which would handle
access to the processor's memory management unit (MMU).  With the new layer
in place, there would be no more hierarchical page tables in the core
kernel.  If the hardware uses hierarchical tables, the
architecture-specific code would still work with them, but they would be
hidden from the core.  The proposed replacement interface is somewhat vague
at this stage, but some features have been sketched out:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A new type, <tt>mmu_entry_t</tt> would represent a translation from 
     a virtual address to the corresponding physical address.  It thus
     functions like a page table entry, but it could contain information
     not necessarily found in page table entries now, such as "large page"
     information and, possibly, statistics information.
<p>
<li> A translation set (<tt>mmu_translation_set_t</tt>) represents the
     address space for a process; it is a collection of
     <tt>mmu_entry_t</tt> values and required housekeeping information.
<p>
<li> The new interface would also implement transactions
     (<tt>mmu_transaction_t</tt>), so that complex changes to page tables
     could be performed in an atomic manner.  The transaction abstraction
     hides the page table locking within the architecture-specific code,
     since that locking may be done in very different ways.
</ul>
<p>

Initially, the new interface would be implemented on top of the existing
hierarchical page tables.  The transition could thus be made a little
smoother, and architectures which actually use the hierarchical tables
could continue to function as always.  Eventually, however, direct access
to those tables from the core kernel code would be removed, and
architectures with different ideas of how page tables should be managed
would be able to drop the hierarchical tables.
<p>

Once the transition has been made, other things would become possible as
well.  The current memory management system is really only comfortable when
pages are all the same size.  The support for huge pages has been bolted on
to the side, and it does not really hide the fact that different processors
handle large pages in very different ways.  The new scheme would present a
simple <tt>mksize()</tt> function to change the size of a page, and would
hide from the kernel the details of how that size change is actually done.
In addition, the new scheme would allow for global pages which appear in
every process's address space, and for keeping statistics of the various
types of pages in the system.

<p>

Discussion of the proposal has been muted.  Actually, it has been almost
nonexistent.  Unfortunately, things often happen that way when abstract
proposals are posted to the kernel lists.  Kernel developers respect actual
code far more than design ideas; they will often wait until an
implementation is posted for review, then talk about how it <i>should</i>
have been done.  So the new memory management interface may have to make
some more progress before the discussion can truly begin.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Am I right in believing that if this infrastructure were in place, the kernel could in theory move towards using huge pages wherever possible in the VM? In other words, instead of hacks like hugetlbfs, the kernel could aim to allocate chunks of 4MB (or whatever the large page size is) as single pages, only using 4KB pages for smaller allocs?
<p>Obviously, I'm glossing over issues like memory fragmentation, efficiency of allocation, how to slice up a 4MB page into a 4KB page and go back again when possible, whether it's worth defragging physical memory to use 4MB pages (less of an issue if you have a block-move engine), and other important issues.

Once upon a time, the networking and block subsystems were entirely
separate from each other.  The venerable NFS protocol brought the two
closer together, but current protocols (such as iSCSI) are truly blurring this
once-rigid distinction.  Is iSCSI a network protocol which happens to carry
SCSI commands, or a block transport which happens to run over a network
interface?  Either way, the convergence of these two areas is creating
difficulties.  Roland Dreier led a session which looked at this issue.
<p>

The worst of these problems has been <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/129703/">covered before</a> in LWN.  When
memory gets tight, the system must be able to write dirty pages to their
backing store.  When that writing involves a network link, however, it is
often necessary to allocate more memory to free memory.  This situation can
lead quickly to deadlocks, where the system is unable to free memory and
continue getting work done.  Block devices can have similar problems, but
things are far worse in the networking world; a network-based block device
must be able to transmit <i>and receive</i> data while somehow dealing with
unrelated packets on the same interfaces.
<p>

To make things worse, some protocols might even require help from user
space if connections are lost and must be re-established.

<p>
There was some talk of ways to approach this problem, but Linus had to
simply put his foot down: this problem is hard, and people have been trying
to solve it for decades.  Rather than continuing to beat our heads against
the wall, wouldn't it just be better to tell people to buy a local disk?
Diskless systems were shown to be a bad idea back in the 1980's; why repeat
the same mistakes 20 years later?
<p>

The simple answer to that question is that people running 4,000-node
clusters do not wish to spend their lives replacing failing disk drives.
Linus does recognize the issue, and is resigned to the fact that work will
go into trying to make this sort of hardware work reliably.  But he thinks
the community should also push back and recommend that people use better,
safer alternatives.
<p>

The classic solution to this sort of problem is to set aside memory for
emergency use.  The block layer uses memory pools for this purpose, but,
with straight block hardware, it is easy to know how much memory is needed
to be able to make reasonable forward progress in all situations.  When
network-based storage is involved, there is no easy answer to that
question.  Setting aside one half of memory would probably solve the
problem, but that is a cost that few users are willing to pay.
<p>

The <i>real</i> solution is to realize that, in the end, this is a virtual
memory problem.  If the VM subsystem could throttle a process before it
manages to dirty the bulk of the memory in the system, this sort of memory
pressure would not arise.  But that is easier said than done: the VM
subsystem is not normally notified when a process dirties a page; that
happens all the time, and involving the kernel would slow things down
greatly.  That said, one can envision schemes where the system operates
normally until it notices that a significant portion of its pages are
dirty.  At that point, the remaining clean pages could be write protected
and the system would go into a defensive mode.  Whenever a process faults
on a write-protected page, it could be forced to sleep if the system needs
to catch up on its memory reclamation work.  The performance penalty could
be significant, but the performance of a deadlocked system is even worse.
<p>

One other potential problem which was raised was kernel stack usage.  If
you have a filesystem involving some pathological combination of NFS,
cluster filesystems, the device mapper, iSCSI, IPsec, and more, a "simple"
filesystem operation could end up calling deeply into the kernel.  There
was no real discussion of this issue, however.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      There really is no amount of memory you can simply set aside in an emergency pool to avoid these memory deadlocks.  You have to reserve memory for a particular thread of execution; the more threads, the more memory.  And you have to reserve the memory and other resources in a fixed order.  I.e. make sure you never need Level N or N+1 resource in order to proceed to where you can release Level N resource you are already holding.
<p>
This is where ISCSI has a special problem.  Linux has been designed so that the network is a higher layer than memory management.  A network function can request MM services, and an MM function can't request network services.  But in ISCSI, MM does in fact need network services (to give you memory, MM has to clean dirty memory, which means it needs block services, which need network services).
<p>
The only fix is to put the resource grabbing back in order -- make sure a process reserves all of the memory it needs to finish what it's doing at one time, and somehow makes it available to the functions further down its stack that need it.  This is a nontrivial extension of various kernel services.
<p>
As for the problem that a process' memory requirement changes without any kernel participation when the process dirties memory:  The kernel has to make the reservation at the time it adds a dirtyable page to the process' address space.
<p>
Throttling, like an arbitrary emergency reserve, mitigates but does not solve the deadlock problem.  Throttling is where you choke off new work at its source.  It can help performance and fairness.  But to avoid deadlock, you have to push the work back from the destination: don't accept any piece of work until you've reserved all the resources needed to guarantee you'll complete it.  It has the same slowing effect, but is fundamentally different from throttling.

<p>
 Belive it could be easly solved when "things" develop to the recognition that the intire Network Subsystem could be offloaded to their own complete systems with a NUP(network CPU) and local memory and IO management, in exactly the same way that happened with graphics/video subsystems.<br>
<p>
 A NIC(or mobo integrated) *should* be in the same form of a Graphic Adapter... a whole system in itself!<br>
<p>
 The sorry thing to forsee is that it would require close cooperation with hardware manufactors, the same as the graphic world require,... and there is a area where Linux/FOSS perform very badly.<br>

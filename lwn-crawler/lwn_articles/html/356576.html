Much of the realtime scheduling work in Linux has been based around getting
the best behavior out of the POSIX realtime scheduling classes.  Techniques
like priority inheritance, for example, exist to ensure that the
highest-priority task really can run within a bounded period of time.  In
much of the rest of the world, though, priorities and POSIX realtime are no
longer seen as the best way to solve the problem.  Instead, the realtime
community likes to talk about "deadlines" and deadline-oriented
scheduling.  In this article, we'll look at a deadline scheduler has
recently been posted for review and related discussion at the recent Real
Time Linux Workshop in Dresden.
<p>
Priority-based realtime scheduling has the advantage of being fully
deterministic - the highest-priority task always runs.  But priority-based
scheduling is subject to some unpleasant failure modes (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion">priority
inversion</a> 
and starvation, for example), does not really isolate tasks running on the
same system, and is often not the best way to describe the problem.  Most
tasks are more readily described in terms of an amount of work which must
be accomplished within a specific time period; the desire to work in those
terms has led to a lot of research in deadline-based scheduling in recent
years.
<p>

A deadline system does away with static priorities.  Instead, each running
task provides a set of three scheduling parameters:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A deadline - when the work must be completed.
<li> An execution period - how often the work must be performed.
<li> The worst-case execution time (WCET) - the maximum amount of CPU 
     time which will be required to get the work done.
</ul>
<p>
Deadline-scheduled tasks usually recur on a regular basis - thus the period
parameter - but sporadic work can also be handled with this model.
<p>
There are some advantages to this model.  The "bandwidth" requirement of a
process - what percentage of a CPU it needs - is easily calculated, so the
scheduler knows at the outset whether the system is oversubscribed or not.
The scheduler can (and should) refuse to accept tasks which would require
more bandwidth than the system has available.
By refusing excess work, the scheduler
will always be able to provide the requisite CPU time to every process
within the specified deadline.  That kind of promise makes realtime
developers happy.
<p>
Linux currently has no deadline scheduler.  There is, however, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/353797/">an implementation posted for
review</a> by Dario Faggioli and others; Dario also presented this
scheduler in Dresden.  This implementation uses the "earliest deadline first"

<a href="/Articles/356691/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/dario-faggioli-sm.jpg" width=150 height=182
border=0 hspace=2 align="right"></a>

(EDF) algorithm, which is based on a simple concept: the process with the earliest
deadline will be  the first to run.  Essentially, EDF attempts to ensure that
every process <i>begins</i> executing by its deadline, not that it actually
gets all of its work done by then.  Since EDF runs work as early as
possible, most tasks should complete well ahead of their declared
deadlines, though.
<p>
This scheduler is implemented with the creation of a new scheduling class
called <tt>SCHED_EDF</tt>.  It does away with the distinction between the
"deadline" and "period" parameters, using a single time period for both.
The patch places this class between the existing
realtime classes (<tt>SCHED_FIFO</tt> and <tt>SCHED_RR</tt>) and the normal
interactive scheduling class (<tt>SCHED_FAIR</tt>).  The idea behind this
placement was to avoid breaking the "highest priority always runs" promise
provided by the POSIX realtime classes.  Peter Zijlstra, though, <a
href="/Articles/356587/">thinks</a> that deadline scheduling should run at
the highest priority; otherwise it cannot ensure that the deadlines will be
met.  That placement could be seen as violating POSIX requirements; to
that, Peter responds, "<q>In short, sod POSIX.</q>"
<p>
Peter would also like to name the scheduler <tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt>, for
the simple reason that EDF is not the only deadline algorithm out there.
In the future, it may be desirable to switch to a different algorithm
without forcing applications to change which scheduling class they
request.  At the moment, the other contender would appear to be "least
laxity first" scheduling, which picks the task with the smallest amount of
"cushion" time between its remaining compute time and its deadline.  Least
laxity first tries to ensure that each process can complete its computing
by the deadline.  It tends to suffer from much higher context-switching
rates than EDF, though, and nobody is pushing such a scheduler for Linux at
the moment.
<p>
One nice feature of deadline schedulers is that no process should be able
to prevent another from completing its work before its deadline passes.  The
real world is messier 
than that, as we will see below, but, even in the absence of deeper
problems, the scheduler can only make that guarantee if every process
actually stops running within its declared WCET.  The EDF scheduler solves
that problem in an unsubtle way: when a process exceeds its bandwidth, it
is simply pushed out of the CPU until its next deadline period begins.
This approach is simple to implement and ensures that deadlines will be
met, but it can be hard on a process which must do a bit of extra computing
on occasion.
<p>
In the <tt>SCHED_EDF</tt> patch, processes indicate the end of their
processing period by calling <tt>sched_yield()</tt>.  This modification to
the semantics of that system call makes some developers uneasy, though; it
is likely that the final patch will do something different.  There may be a
new "I'm done for now" system call added for this purpose.
<p>
Peter also gave a talk in Dresden; his was mostly about why Linux does not
have a deadline 
scheduler yet.  The "what happens when a process exceeds its WCET" problem
was one of the reasons he gave.  Calculating the 
worst-case execution time is exceedingly difficult for any sort of
non-trivial program.  As Peter puts it, researchers have spent their entire
lives trying to solve it.  There are people working on automatically
deriving WCET from the source, but they are far from being able to do this
with real-world systems.  So, for now, specification of the WCET comes down
to empirical observations and guesswork.

<p>
Another serious problem with EDF is that it works much better on
single-processor systems than on SMP systems.  True EDF on a multiprocessor
system requires the maintenance of a global run queue, with all of the
scalability problems that entails.  One solution is to partition SMP
systems, so that each CPU becomes an essentially independent scheduling domain;
the SCHED_EDF patch works this way.  Partitioned systems have their own
problems, of course; the assignment of tasks to CPUs can be a pain, and it
is hard (or impossible) to get full utilization if tasks cannot move
between CPUs. 
<p>

Another problem with partitioning is that some scheduling problems simply
cannot be solved without occasional process migration.  Imagine a two-CPU
system running three processes, each of which needs 60% of a single CPU's
time.  The system clearly has the resources to run those three processes,
but not if it is unable to move processes between CPUs.  So a partitioned
EDF scheduler needs to be able to migrate processes occasionally; the
<tt>SCHED_EDF</tt> developers have migration logic in the works, but it has
not yet been posted.

<p>
Yet another serious problem, according to Peter, is priority inversion.  The
priority inheritance techniques used to solve priority inversion are tied
to priorities; it is not clear how to apply them to deadline schedulers.
But the problem is real: imagine a process acquiring an important lock,

<a href="/Articles/356693/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/peter-zijlstra-sm.jpg" width=150 height=158
alt="[Peter Zijlstra]" border=0 align="left" hspace=2></a>

then being preempted or forced out because it has exceeded its WCET.  That
process can 
then block the execution of otherwise runnable processes with urgent
deadlines.
<p>
There are a few ways to approach this issue.  Simplest, perhaps, is
deadline inheritance: lock owners inherit the earliest deadline in the
system for as long as they hold the lock.  More sophisticated is bandwidth
inheritance; in this case, a lock owner which has exhausted its WCET will
receive a "donation" of time from the process(es) blocked on that lock.  A
variant of that technique is proxy execution: blocked processes are left on the run
queue, but, when they "run," the lock owner runs in their place.  Proxy
execution gets tricky in SMP environments when multiple processes are
blocked on the same lock; the result could be multiple CPUs trying to
proxy-execute the same process.  The solution to that problem appears to be
to migrate blocked processes to the owner's CPU.
<p>
Proxy execution also runs into difficulties when the lock-owning process is
blocked for I/O.  In that case, it cannot run as a proxy for the original
blocked task, which must then be taken off the run queue.  That, in turn,
forces the creation of a "wait list" of processes which must be returned to
a runnable state when a different process (the lock owner) becomes
runnable.  Needless to say, all this logic adds complexity and increases
system overhead.

<p>

The final problem, according to Peter, is POSIX, but it's an easy one to
solve.  Since POSIX is silent on the topic of deadline schedulers, we can
do anything we want and life is good.  He repeated that
<tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt> will probably be placed above <tt>SCHED_FIFO</tt>
in priority.  There will be a new system call -
<tt>sched_setscheduler_ex()</tt> - to enable processes to request the
deadline scheduler and set the parameters accordingly; the
<tt>SCHED_EDF</tt> patch already implements that call.  So many of the
pieces for deadline scheduling for Linux are in place, but a number of the
details are yet to be resolved.

<p>
The bottom line is that deadline schedulers in the real world are a
non-trivial problem - something that is true of real-world scheduling in
general.  These problems should be solvable, though, and Linux should be
able to support a deadline scheduler at some point in the future.  That
scheduler will probably make its first appearance in the realtime tree,
naturally, but it could eventually find users well beyond the realtime
community.  Deadline schedulers are a fairly natural fit for periodic tasks
like the management of streaming media, which could
profitably make use of deadline scheduling to help eliminate jitter and
dropped-data problems.  But that remains a little while in the future;
first, the code must be made ready for widespread use.  And that, as we all
know, is a process which recognizes few deadlines.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Well, extending struct sched_param is more than possible, I agree, but it would be a _really_big_ ABI issue, don't you think?<br>
Especially when a 'legacy' binary comes to, e.g., a sched_getparam, and the data it gets will be bigger than expected... :-(<br>

Actually, good point!<br>
<p>
In our intents _ex stands for EXtended, which means it can be used not only for this particular new scheduling policy, but for all the ones (if/when they will come! :-P) that needs the EXtended sched_param structure.<br>
<p>
(It is the same name used by Xenomai for the same purpose, i.e., supporting new scheduling policies with extended parameters, such as POSIX's SCHED_SPORADIC.)<br>

I think it _is_ a good thing to keep this general but, hey, we can discusss about that! :-)<br>

OK (though the name is reminiscent of the horrible Win32 API to my ears), but adding a new scheduler requiring different parameters would be another ABI change, wouldn't it, requiring another new syscall: the parameter type would change. Either that or you make the parameter type a void *, which is just ioctl() in new clothes and Linus would tear your lungs out.<br>

Well, this may be true or not, depending on the new new scheduler!<br>
<p>
Generally speacking, you are definitely right, since each new scheduler/scheduling class could ask some room for its own parameter(s).<br>
What we were thinking here is (and this also comes from some comments/suggestions we got on LKML):<br>
 - if we define a general enough task model, it is likely that even new <br>
   algorithms can deal with that, without the need of their very specific <br>
   fields;<br>
 - if we want, sched_param_ex could be bloated a little bit with some <br>
   padding or non-utilized field, reserved for future extensions.<br>
<p>
However, I'm sure that, if things keep going, this issue will came up in LKML at some point, and then we we'll see what people there think... :-D<br>

Thanks for your comments,<br>

When you created the _ex functions, why didn't you make them take length parameters like the socket-address ones do, thus solving the ABI compatibility problem once and for all?<br>

This ..._ex() naming is really horrible. What do you do when you need to extend it again? Call it ..._ex2()? ..._ex_ex()?<br>
<p>
Unix solved that naming problem in a much more elegant way a long time ago, by simply appending the number of parameters. So we have wait3() and wait4(); dup(), dup2(), and the new dup3(); pipe() and pipe2(); inotify_init() and inotify_init1(); and so on (see <a href="http://udrepper.livejournal.com/20407.html">http://udrepper.livejournal.com/20407.html</a> for how recent some of these are).<br>

The realtime systems that I've worked on have had three scheduling parameters:<br>
<p>
#  A deadline - when the work must be completed.<br>
#  An execution period - how often the work must be performed.<br>
#  An earliest start time - because the data to process will not be available before then.<br>
<p>
Deadline scheduling isn't interested in the third parameter and as such is not much more useful than priority-based realtime scheduling.<br>
<p>
I can't think of an application where the deadline-based scheduler described here would be sufficient.<br>

Hello, <br>
<p>
I see your point. I don't see how a execution time would be completely irrelevant. You could potentially use that information for ordering, such as priorities small task above big tasks in case large task doesn't complete on time or priorities large tasks for long uninterrupted processing with small tasks filling in the spaces. <br>
<p>
Execution time would be difficult at best to predict but could be used as a guestimate and record actually min/max execution times.<br>

but without any indication of how much time the process will take to complete, the only thing the OS could do is prohibit anything else from using the CPU between the start time and the deadline, which is almost certainly _not_ the correct thing to do.<br>

Because I know exactly when it WILL be available.  If I have to tell the scheduler each and every time when I want a piece of code (that runs periodically) to run, it is not really doing me much good.  I might as well just use the standard realtime priority-based scheduler and set the priority appropriately.<br>
<p>
But really, the burning question for me is this:  What application is this type of scheduling (deadline scheduling) sufficient for?  I just don't see one where this is actually more useful that the standard priority-based scheduler.<br>

      Any sort of periodic data-processing application can benefit from this sort of scheduling regime.  Imagine an audio application which must get data into the sound card's buffers every so often.  With deadline scheduling, that can happen and audio glitches go away.

      Tweaking the priority is OK if the audio application is the only thing you care about.  But priorities don't eliminate interference between applications, and they can be hard to set up correctly in more complex situations.

OK, I've read the Ericsson posting.  The example there is dead easy to do with priority-based scheduling, the 20ms tasks are done at a higher priority than the rest of the software.<br>

<p>Small correction: s/would still work/will break easily/. If you 
<b>only</b> have one application then you don't need any scheduler. But if 
you have few applications they will step on each other toes. With deadline 
scheduler if application got the promise - it'll be run and other 
applications will behave (they'll be evicted in worst case).</p>

<p>It's not the job for kernel to provide full set of usefull functions to 
program - it should provide minimal set needed to make implementation 
possible. AFAICS normal scheduler does not offer enough, while deadline 
scheduler does (even if I'm not 100% sure it does so with current API).</p>

"it'll be run and other applications will behave (they'll be evicted in worst case)."<br>
<p>
So, you are just trading one failure mode for another (if the system is overloaded).  Misbehaving applications cause failure in either case.  Also, having the scheduler reject work that it can't finish in time is STILL breakage of the system.<br>
<p>
If I have two tasks, one real-time, one not, I set the real-time task to a higher priority and it gets all the CPU it wants, when it wants it - no breakage is possible from lower-priority tasks.  <br>

Where is the "killer app" for the deadline scheduler?  People have been looking for it for years and no one seems to have found it.  Maybe it doesn't exist.<br>

      <blockquote>Where is the "killer app" for the deadline

<p>Where is the killer app for multitasking OS? People used DOS for ten 
years and were happy. Why, they even had background printing and other 
goodies - with resident programs. Then suddenly... OS/2, Windows, Linux, 
etc. WTF all the hoopla is all about?</p>

<p>As long as your system has one and one realtime program <b>only</b> - 
you don't need deadline scheduler. But if you have two... Think mobile 
phone: you have <b>two</b> competing real-time tasks. One is game you are 
playing right now and another is actual phone application which sends and 
receives calls! I sure as hell want to have high response times from my 
games (and I currently don't have that) <b>but</b> if someone calls me - 
all bets are off. If game can survive - I'm happy, but if not - I don't 
care.</p>

<p>Sure you can do this with todays scheduler and some tricks... like you 
can run print.exe for background printing in DOS. Both are poor, fragile 
solutions.</p>

Hi clugstj, I'll try to show my point of view on this point...<br>
<p>
First of all, I kind of agree with you that it is not easy to find an application, or even a set of applications, that do not work _at_all_ with the current combination of best-effort + fixed priority real-time scheduling.<br>
In fact, this is right the scheme that is implemented in Linux as for now and --fortunately for all of us! :-D-- Linux already works very well in many contextes, and succesfully runs thousands of applications!<br>
<p>
On the contrary, since no deadline scheduling is in place, not only in Linux, but nor it is in the vast majority of all existent (even real-time) operating systems, it is hard to find an example of an app which is happily scheduled by deadlines at this moment! :-P<br>
<p>
This said, the point here is if there are some kind of workload that would be better represented by a runtime/deadline/period model than just by a priority value.<br>
Since you're looking for examples (and, to me, you're right in doing that!) we can consider multimedia applications, that are intrinsically periodic (or sporadic) --e.g., 25 frames per second-- and that intrinsically have deadlines --e.g., presentation times for frames.<br>
Thus, especially if, as many are saying, we have quite a lot of these applications, would life be easier if we let them specify their requirements a little bit more naturally than asking them (or the sysadmin) to tune/tweak their priority?<br>
I think that this is not going to be necessarily true, but if we want to try it out, we need a deadline scheduler! :-D<br>
<p>
Then, from a more ``academic'' point of view, which is better from fixed priority and deadline based scheduler is a long struggle, which, as years are passing, is turning into a legendary tale, an epic saga... :-O<br>
Here, in real-time scheduling theory, we have, among the others, two major algorithms: Rate Monotonic, which is fixed priority (prio = 1/task_period), and EDF, which is dynamic.<br>
Again, my personal opinions are:<br>
 - FP/RM is very simple to understand and to implement<br>
 - FP/RM yields slightly smaller implementation overhead<br>
 - FP/RM is very predictable and deterministic, a lot useful in hard <br>
   real-time scenarios<br>
 - EDF is more flexible and still predictable<br>
 - EDF allows better exploitation of system resources (CPU, both on UP and <br>
   SMP)<br>
 - EDF has more graceful performance degradation in case of system <br>
   overload (kind of fairness, bounded tardiness, etc.)<br>
 - EDF, for the reasons above, is often considered to be better suited for <br>
   soft real-time workloads, especially on mixed rt non-rt systems.<br>
<p>
And again, which is the best one? Well, I'm not going to answer! :-D<br>
By the way, I hope I added some bits to the discussion, did I?<br>
<p>

Dario<br>

I see this kind of sceduler being useful for two cases:<br>
<p>
1) A buggy task which gets stuck in an infinite loop, rather than locking out all lower-priority <br>
tasks and effectively locking out the system as it would with RT sceduling, would just use up <br>
its allocated time. This could be a huge debugging aid and reliability improvement in such a <br>
system. <br>
<p>
2) A high priority task can leave some CPU time to lower-priority tasks. For example, <br>
suppose you have a high-priority computational thread which occasionally spends several <br>
CPU-seconds at a time, and a low-priority communication thread. It would be good to limit <br>
the computation thread to consuming no more than 90% of the CPU, so communication can <br>
proceed. Of course, it would be even nicer if it got all 100% when the communication thread <br>
didn't want any.  <br>

There is no "killer app", but there are killer categories.<br>
<p>
Audio, video, 3D accelerated applications (video games) - all these are noticeable if they starve briefly.<br>
<p>
Although assigning real time priority to all the applications will work, you can cause a denial of service on your own system and root access is required to set real time priorities without prior configuration.<br>
<p>
That's too much risk and work for me, the lowly user.<br>

Well, of course all a deadline scheduler needs to do is job are deadlines. :-)<br>
 <br>
Thus, we can say that execution time are not needed by the scheduler, but they for sure are needed by the guy that performs some kind of admission test, to avoid oversubscription!<br>
<p>
The reason why we went for a, let's say, 'bandwidth scheduler based on EDF' is that, as our editor correctly pointed out, WCET estimation is a very difficult job, especially in a system like Linux is!<br>

Perhaps a bit of an apples and oranges issue, but some here might be interested in work we presented earlier this year at the Eurosys 2009 conference:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ashvin/publications/timely-scheduling-eurosys09.pdf">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ashvin/publications/timely-s...</a><br>
<p>
Our work might be thought of somewhat like a deadline scheduler.  Instead of deadlines, we focus on release-times--i.e. when the application would like to execute.  In our model, the application partitions it's own work into time-critical and computational events.  It uses a new system call to supply timing (release-times) directly to the kernel, and to cooperate with other time-sensitive tasks. <br>
<p>
A central thesis of our work is that responsiveness (running when you want to run) and fairness (amount of time one gets) should be independent.   <br>
<p>
Bottom line:  we can maintain 1ms range responsiveness even while the system is 100% loaded.   Our work is targeted to adaptive applications, i.e. those that can adapt quality by skipping less important work, so as to maintain timing for the more important stuff.<br>
<p>
In the paper, we give examples with video, and also modified the X11 server.<br>

actually, I agree, relationship between real-time (especially deadline based) scheduling and power management is a very interesting topic!<br>

yes, we are having an internal ML. Now that the project said 'hello' to the outside world we are setting things up to open the developping process as well, and this will include the ML.<br>
<p>
I am right now moving the project repositories, with the new version of the patch referred in this article, on gitorious.org.<br>
The webpage of the project (www.evidence.eu.com/sched_edf.html) will be updated soon with all the information.<br>
<p>
However, for any kind of issue, question, communication or whatever, you can reach me at raistlin_AT_linux_DOT_it, I will be happy to (try to) help! :-D<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Dario<br>

I have already seen a simple algorithme that give garanties latencies responses.<br>
<p>
If you have 3 tasks, A, B, C. A wants 50% of the lowest possible latency, B and C want only 25% of it.<br>
<p>
So you have a list of rotating priority with [A,B,A,C]. So you could garanties the time between 2 accesses of the cpus. <br>
<p>
Each time you need to take a decision the list of task rotate (or at fixed period of time), then you use the priorities like for usual fixed priorites task scheduler.<br>

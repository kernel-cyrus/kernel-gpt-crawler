It has now been nearly five years since Tsugikazu Shibata <a
href="/Articles/464834/">announced</a> the launch of the long-term support
initiative 
(LTSI) project.  LTSI's objective is to provide extended support for
specific kernel releases that can serve as a rallying point for
embedded-system vendors and a means by which those vendors can get their
patches 
upstream.  At LinuxCon Japan 2016, Shibata-san provided an update on LTSI;
he was followed by Tim Bird, who discussed the "Fuego" test framework that
is now being used to help validate LTSI releases.
<p>
<h4>An LTSI update</h4>
<p>
The core process for LTSI kernels has not changed much since the project's
inception.  LTSI releases are based on the long-term support releases
maintained by Greg Kroah-Hartman, and are maintained for the same time
period.  They do, however, include a significant set of extra patches in
the form of vendor-contributed features and backports from more recent
kernels; they also go through more extensive testing than ordinary
stable-kernel releases.
<p>
Five years in, LTSI is seeing some significant adoption.  The <a
href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto</a> meta-distribution has had an
option to use LTSI kernels since 2012.  The <a
href="https://www.automotivelinux.org/">Automotive Grade Linux</a> project

<a href="/Articles/694884/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lcj/TsugikazuShibata-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Tsugikazu Shibata]" title="Tsugikazu Shibata" hspace=3 vspace=3
border=0 align="right"></a>

is using LTSI kernels (via Yocto).  The relatively new <a
href="https://www.cip-project.org/">Civil Infrastructure Platform</a> (CIP)
project is also using LTSI, with an interesting twist.  Systems based on
CIP are likely to be deployed in situations where they are expected to run
for a long time, so there is a need for long-term support with a different
value of "long-term": 10-15&nbsp;years.  CIP will itself be providing that
support by taking over responsibility for LTSI kernels after LTSI itself
has moved on.  Shibata-san noted that supporting a kernel for that long is
going to be an interesting challenge; he wished the project luck.
<p>
The LTSI release process starts with one of the regular long-term support
releases.  There is a four- or five-month period in which patches to this
kernel are prepared; these include backports and other features that are
useful to the LTSI community.  That is followed by a two-month merge window
in which all those patches are applied.  One month of validation follows;
all contributors to the LTSI kernel are expected to ensure that things work
properly in the final release.  This process, Shibata-san claimed, leads to
the production of one of the most stable and secure kernels available.
<p>
That said, there are concerns that the current seven-month process takes
too long; the latency in the process is especially acutely felt with the
4.4 kernel, which came a bit sooner than had been expected.  So the project
is talking about shortening the release process this time around; there
would be a two-month preparation period and a one-month merge window.  The
final decision on that change, it seems, will come in the near future.
<p>
<h4>Fuego</h4>
<p>
One of the significant changes in the LTSI release process mentioned by
Shibata-san was the adoption of a new testing framework called "Fuego."
Bird used the next session to talk about Fuego and how it works.  In short,
Fuego is the combination of the <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>
continuous-integration tool, a set of scripts, and a collection of tests,
all packaged within a Docker container.
<p>
Jenkins is used to run tests based on various triggers and collect the
results.  It is widely used and features hundreds of extensions to handle
things like email notifications or integration with source-code management
systems.  The big customization that Fuego has added is to separate host

<a href="/Articles/694885/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lcj/TimBird-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Tim Bird]" title="Tim Bird" hspace=3 vspace=3
border=0 align="left"></a>

and target configuration; testing can be directed from a host, but it runs
on the specific embedded target of interest.
<p>
There is a set of "abstraction scripts" designed to make Fuego work with
any specific target board; these scripts are driven by variables
describing how to 
interact with the board, functions to get or put files and run commands,
etc.  The end result is a generated script to run the actual tests.  There
are about fifty tests integrated into the system so far; most of those are
existing tests from elsewhere, but the plan is to add a bunch of new tests
as well.
<p>
The whole system is designed to be packaged up into a Docker container.
The end result should be runnable on any Linux distribution without
modification.
<p>
Fuego was designed to be easy for embedded engineers to set up and run.  It
comes with configurations for specific target systems, including Yocto,
Buildroot, OpenWrt, and more.  Various target types and transports are
supported; Fuego can talk to a target using a serial port, SSH, or
Android's <tt>adb</tt> tool, among others.  It is designed to send test
results to a centralized repository.  The end goal is to enable the
creation of a decentralized test network, allowing the testing of changes
on a wide variety of hardware and getting past the "I don't have that
particular board" problem.
<p>
Future plans include the decluttering of the Jenkins interface, which is
rather busy at the moment.  The project would like to add handling for USB
connections, making it easier to use tools like <tt>adb</tt> to talk to
handset-like devices.  More documentation and more tests are on the list,
as is integration with the <a href="https://kernelci.org/">kernelci.org</a>
project.
<p>
More users and contributors would certainly be welcome.  The project is
using the <a
href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/ltsi-dev">ltsi-dev
mailing list</a> for its communications for now; more information on the
project, including pointers to the repositories, can be found on <a
href="http://elinux.org/Fuego">elinux.org</a>.  See <a
href="http://bird.org/fuego/FrontPage">this page</a> for more information
on how to install and use Fuego.

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 5, 2017</br>
           </div>
Many exploits come down to convincing code (kernel or otherwise) to access
a pointer that was crafted by the attacker.  Buffer-overflow exploits and
return-oriented programming, for example, both rely on placing a pointer
where a return address is expected; when the processor "returns" to that
address, the attacker takes control.  Much of the hardening work over the
years has focused on making it harder to overwrite addresses in this way.
But, as demonstrated by a recent kernel patch set, there may be another
way: using a new ARM processor feature to detect and reject crafted
addresses.
<p>
In particular, the ARM 8.3 architecture added a feature called "pointer
authentication"; its purpose is to detect pointers created by an external
entity.  In essence, it attaches a cryptographic signature to pointer
values; those signatures can be verified before a pointer is used.  An
attacker, lacking the key used to create the signatures, is unlikely to be
able to create valid pointers for use in an exploit.
<p>
Contemporary processors use 64-bit pointer values, but not all of those
bits are actually significant.  On an ARM64 Linux system using three-level page
tables, only the bottom 40 bits are used, while the remaining 24 are equal to
the highest significant bit — the 40-bit address is sign-extended to
64&nbsp;bits, in other words.  
(For the curious, <a
href="/Articles/718895/">Documentation/arm64/memory.txt</a> describes the
virtual address space layout on ARM64 systems).
Those uppermost bits (or a subset thereof)
could be put to other uses, including holding an authentication code.
<p>
That code is calculated from three values: the pointer itself, a secret key
hidden in the process context, and a third value like the current stack
pointer.  The secret key is intended to make it impossible for an attacker
to generate valid codes, while the stack pointer (or some other
environmental value) can help prevent the reuse of a valid, signed pointer
should one leak to the attacker.  The new <tt>PAC</tt> instruction can be
used to calculate the authentication code and insert it into a pointer
value.
<p>
The value containing the authentication code cannot be dereferenced
directly, since, without the sign-extension bits, it is no longer
recognized as a valid address.  Regaining a usable pointer requires using
the <tt>AUT</tt> instruction, which will recalculate the authentication
code and compare it to what is found in the authenticated pointer value.
If the two match, the authentication code will be removed; otherwise, the
pointer will be modified to ensure a fault should it be dereferenced.
Thus, any attempt to use a pointer that lacks a proper authentication code
will lead to a crash.
<p>
ARM 8.3 provides five separate keys that can be used to authenticate
pointers: two for executable (instruction) pointers, two for data, and one
"general" key.  The <a href="/Articles/718778/">RFC patch set</a> from Mark
Rutland only uses one of the instruction keys, though, reserving the other keys
for future use.  For the time being, the feature is only provided for user
space; it is not yet used within the kernel itself.  Whenever a process is
created, the kernel will generate a random key and store it in that
process's context; the process will then be able to use that key to sign
and authenticate pointers, but it cannot read the key itself.
<p>
Actually making use of this feature to, for example, block buffer-overflow
exploits is left to user space.  The good news here is that the <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html">GCC&nbsp;7</a>
compiler will include basic support for pointer authentication in the form
of the <tt>-msign-return-address</tt> option.  Turning this option on will
cause code to be added to function prologues to sign the return address;
that address will then be authenticated before returning to it.  Options
exist to limit authentication to non-leaf functions (those that call other
functions), or to all functions in the compilation unit.
<p>
If this feature works as advertised, this return-address authentication
should be enough to block basic buffer-overrun attacks.  An attacker may be able
to overwrite a function's return address, but they cannot generate the
proper authentication code, so a jump to that address will never be taken.
The code itself is not large, so the potential for brute-force attacks
exists, but those attacks cannot be performed without causing the target
process to crash multiple times — an outcome that should attract attention
in most settings.
<p>
The patch posting is a first-round request for comments, so it is likely to
see some changes before being considered for merging.  There is some room
for future work, including deciding what to do with the other available key
values and, perhaps, protecting the kernel as well.  There are ways this
feature could be used beyond protecting return addresses.  Structures
containing function pointers are a common target, for example; these, too,
could be protected using authentication.  Pointer authentication will not
solve all of our security problems but it will, with luck, make our systems
that much more resistant to attack.

Or you think the twitter app on the phone has just gone out to lunch again. [I am going from a phone point of view where the app will be fired off automatically if it crashes because it may be prone to crashing anyway.] I wonder if there is a way for a watcher program in the OS can see these crashes and alert the user that this is more malicious than your pokemon go has gone again.<br>

On Android there are already a watchdog and program which crashes all the time would be stopped automatically.<br>

This was done mainly not to make system more secure but to save battery: application which starts crashing in a loop for any reason could drain battery to zero pretty quickly.<br>

      <p>Great article! Especially given how sparse information is on this topic today.</p>

<p>
A couple of minor clarifications:
<ul>
<li>The "general" key should be the "generic" key.</li>
<li><tt>PAC*</tt> and <tt>AUT*</tt> are families of instructions, rather than specific instructions. For example, GCC uses <tt>PACIASP</tt> and <tt>AUTIASP</tt> for authenticating the return address.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Another thing that may be worth noting is that the instructions used by GCC are treated as <tt>NOP</tt>s by existing CPUs. Libraries and applications using those instructions will function on existing hardware (albeit without authentication). At some point, distributions might consider building with authentication unconditionally</p>

Right now there are 24 spare bits on addresses, but presumably that number will shrink over time as processors need to address more physical memory.  x86-64 uses 48 bits in virtual addresses, and presumably ARM64 will eventually follow.<br>
<p>
Also, is there any estimate of the performance impact of adding this protection?<br>

      As the encryption/decryption primitives are implemented in hardware as part of the CPU, I would estimate that the PACIASP instruction would often add just a single cycle to the function prologue - its true latency can be pipelined.
<br>The AUTIASP instruction, on the other hand, must fully complete before returning from a protected function; per the published paper on the QARMA cipher used by this mechanism, the core may for synthesized at anything between 1 cycle per operation up to 16. Assuming the 16-cycle version is chosen (to allow for high frequencies), I would guess the AUTIASP will add around this number of cycles to the function epilogue.
<br>Overall - I would estimate the performance costs to be on par (or better) with all existing schemes.

<p>Regarding the tag size - Qualcomm's paper discusses this quite comprehensively. 24-bit tags are currently "best case" <em>for userspace</em>; some systems will have to give up some bits (e.g. if they use tagged pointers, or if they use a larger virtual size) so the worst-case is just a measly 3-bit tag. On the other hand, more sensitive environments can choose to restrict their virtual address space to (e.g.) 32 bits, and thus have up to 31-bit tags.

      Function returns are typically predicted very well by a branch prediction using a CPU-internal return stack, so any latency added by the AUT instruction just increases the time until the prediction is verified; on a modern out-of-order implementation that should not be noticable.

<p>Concerning the number of bits, I wonder if such instructions could not use all bits in the pointer, producing a kind of encrypted pointer with PAC, and decrypting it with AUT.  That would then also work if all 64 bits are used for pointers; admittedly, in that case you don't notice that the pointer is fishy when decrypting it, and there is a small chance of it hitting mapped memory, but even then the result is unlikely to be something that the attacker can exploit.

      <blockquote><p>"Whenever a process is created, the kernel will generate a random key and store it in that process's context."</p></blockquote>

<p>So, if I understand it correctly, values created by PAC before <code>fork(2)</code> cannot be authenticated by AUT in the child process. Right?</p>

      My fault, that wasn't expressed quite right.  The key is assigned at <tt>exec()</tt> time, not at process creation.  So threads share a key, and parent and child will share a key after <tt>fork()</tt> until one of them calls <tt>exec()</tt>.

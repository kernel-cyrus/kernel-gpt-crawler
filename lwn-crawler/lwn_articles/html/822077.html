<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 5, 2020</br>
           </div>
Just over 7,500 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline
repository since the opening of the 5.8 merge window â€” not a small amount
of work for just four days.  The early pulls are dominated by the
networking and graphics trees, but there is a lot of other material in
there as well.  Read on for a summary of what entered the kernel in the
first part of this development cycle.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Branch-target identification and shadow call stacks (both described in
     <a href="/Articles/804982/">this article</a>) have been added to the
     Arm64 architecture.  Both are hardening technologies that, with luck,
     will make Arm64 systems more resistant to attack.  The shadow call
     stack support is likely to spread to other architectures in the near
     future. 

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>faccessat2()</tt> system call adds the flags argument
     that POSIX has always said should be there.  The current support for
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/faccessat.2.html"><tt>faccessat()</tt></a>
     on Linux systems depends on emulation of the flags argument by the C
     library; <tt>faccessat2()</tt> will allow a better implementation in
     the kernel.
<li> Memory control groups have a new knob, <tt>memory.swap.high</tt>,
     which can be used to slow down tasks that are using large amounts of
     swap space; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b82ab4f2883">this commit</a> for a
     bit more information.
<li> The io_uring subsystem now supports the <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tee.2.html"><tt>tee()</tt>
     system call</a>.
<li> It is now possible to pass a <a href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd</a> to
     the <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html"><tt>setns()</tt>
     system call</a>; in that case, it is possible to specify multiple
     namespace types.  The calling process will be moved to all of the
     applicable namespaces in an atomic manner.
<li> The "BPF iterator" mechanism, which facilitates the dumping of kernel
     data structures to user space, has been merged; this feature was
     covered in <a href="/Articles/818714/">this article</a> in April.
<li> There is a new ring buffer for communicating data from BPF programs.
     It is intended to resemble the perf ring buffer while allowing sharing
     of the buffer across multiple CPUs.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/97abb2b39682">this documentation
     commit</a> for more information.
<li> The <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/padata.html">padata
     mechanism</a> now supports multi-threaded jobs with load balancing;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ec3b39c73189">this
     documentation commit</a> for details.
<li> The kernel's <tt>swappiness</tt> tuning knob, which sets the balance
     between reclaiming file-backed and anonymous pages, has traditionally
     been used to bias the system away from swapping anonymous pages.  With
     fast I/O devices, though, swapping may be faster than filesystem
     access, so it may be useful to bias the system toward swapping.  Now
     <tt>swappiness</tt> can take values up to 200 to push things in that
     direction; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c843966c556d">this commit</a> for
     details. 
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Low-level support for <a href="/Articles/797309/">inline
     encryption</a> has been added to the block layer.  Inline encryption
     is a hardware feature that encrypts (and decrypts) data moving between
     a block storage device and the CPU using a key provided by the CPU.
     Some more information can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/54b259f68de5">this commit</a>.
<li> There is a new <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
     flag (<tt>STATX_ATTR_DAX</tt>) that indicates that the file in
     question is being accessed directly via the DAX mechanism.  There is
     also <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/83d9088659e8">a
     documentation patch</a> that attempts to specify just how filesystems
     will behave when DAX is in use.  More DAX-related changes can be
     expected during this merge window.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Graphics</b>:
     Leadtek LTK050H3146W panels,
     Northwest Logic MIPI DSI host controllers,
     Chrontel CH7033 video encoders,
     Visionox RM69299 panels, and
     ASUS Z00T TM5P5 NT35596 panels.
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     Maxim MAX16601 voltage regulators,
     AMD RAPL MSR-based energy sensors,
     Gateworks System Controller analog-to-digital converters, and
     Baikal-T1 process, voltage, and temperature sensors.
<li> <b>Interrupt control</b>:
     Loongson3 HyperTransport interrupt vector controllers,
     Loongson PCH programmable interrupt controllers, and
     Loongson PCH MSI controllers.
<li> <b>Media</b>:
     Rockchip video decoders and
     OmniVision OV2740 sensors.  The "atomisp" driver has also been
     resurrected in the staging tree and seen vast amounts of cleanup
     work.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     AMD SPI controllers,
     Maxim 77826 regulators,
     Arm CryptoCell true random number generators,
     Amlogic Meson SDHC host controllers, 
     Freescale eSDHC ColdFire controllers, and
     Loongson PCI controllers,
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     Broadcom BCM54140 PHYs,
     Qualcomm IPQ4019 MDIO interfaces,
     MediaTek STAR Ethernet MACs,
     Realtek 8723DE PCI wireless network adapters, and
     MediaTek MT7915E wireless interfaces.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>initrdmem=</tt> boot-time option specifies an initial
     disk image found in RAM; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/694cfd87b0c8">this commit</a> for
     more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The bridge code now supports the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Redundancy_Protocol">media
     redundancy protocol</a>, where a ring of Ethernet switches can be used
     to survive single-unit failures.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/45c9cbec425c">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The new "gate" action for the traffic-control subsystem allows
     specific packets to be passed into the system during specified time
     slots.  This action is naturally undocumented, but some information
     can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a51c328df310">this commit</a>.
<li> Some network devices can perform testing of attached network cables;
     the kernel and <tt>ethtool</tt> utility now support that functionality
     when it is available.
<li> The <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching">multiprotocol
     label switching</a> routing algorithm is now available for IPv6 as
     well as IPv4.
<li> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8229">RFC 8229</a>, which
     describes encapsulation of key-exchange and IPSec packets, is now
     supported. 
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/812719/"><tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt> capability</a>
     has been added; a process with this capability can do performance
     monitoring with the perf events subsystem.
<li> The new <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability covers some BPF operations that
     previously required <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.  In general, most BPF
     operations will also require either <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt> (for tracing
     and such) or <tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt>; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a17b53c4a4b5">this commit</a> gives
     a terse overview of which operations require which capabilities.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The "pstore" mechanism, which stashes away system-state information
     in case of a panic, has gained a new back-end that stores data to a
     block device.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/649304c936cd">this commit</a> for
     documentation.
<li> There is a new read-copy-update (RCU) variant called "RCU rude"; it
     delineates grace periods only at
     context switches.  Those wondering about the name might see the
     comment in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c84aad765406">this
     commit</a>, which reads: "<q>It forces IPIs and context switches on
     all online CPUs, including idle ones, so use with caution</q>".
<li> The <a href="/Articles/607117/">RCU-tasks</a> subsystem has a new "RCU
     tasks trace" variant suited to the needs of tracing and BPF programs;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d5f177d35c24">this
     commit</a> for details.
<li> "Local locks" have been brought over from the realtime preemption
     tree.  These locks are intended to replace code that disables
     preemption and/or interrupts on a single processor.  Advantages
     include a better realtime implementation and the ability to
     properly instrument locking; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/91710728d172">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The API for managing file readahead has changed significantly; see
     <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200414150233.24495-1-willy@infradead.org/">this
     patch series</a> for details. 
<li> The <tt>kgdb</tt> kernel debugger is now able to work with the boot
     console, enabling debugging much earlier in the boot process; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/220995622da5">this commit</a> and
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f71fc3bc7b32">this documentation
     patch</a> for more information.
<li> There is a new buffer-allocation API intended to make the writing of
     XDP network drivers easier.  Documentation is too much to hope for,
     but the API can be seen in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2b43470add8c">this commit</a>.
</ul>
<p>

The 5.8 merge window can be expected to remain open until June&nbsp;14;
after that, the actual 5.8 release should happen in early August.  Stay
tuned; LWN will provide an update on the rest of this merge window after it
closes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is amazing for debuggability on x86 laptops, which typically lack standardized ways of saving the kernel log on panic. I hope more and more block drivers implement the necessary hooks for this.<br>

Extremely badly behaved AMI firmware; deleting EFI vars only hid them from view without deallocating space in nvram. After a few panics happened on one buggy kernel version it started returning -ENOSPC for efivarfs operations.<br>
<p>
At the time I also had `installkernel` set up to update the efibootmgr entries during make install, which made everything worse - couldn't change the default boot to a known-good entry, it was stuck on the bad one.<br>

That one bricked my Thinkpad - my main machine. Luckily, I was at a tech conference among friends and a couple of EFI experts where somebody suggested a complete reflash of the BIOS, someone else had an external USB that could fake a floppy - after one of the most panic stricken 3/4 hours of my life, it all worked. Many years later, it's beside me on the table, still working. Thanks MiniDebConf Cambridge<br>

I heard about that incident. I've never dared use pstore on non-disposable hardware since.<br>
<p>
I suspect this is too paranoid of me -- but it still feels nicer to be able to use a blockdev. (Or it would if all my disks weren't fully partitioned already -- I don't imagine it would work on USB mass storage... expecting *that* to work in panic state seems like asking a lot.)<br>

The "delete from view without reallocating" is actually a reasonable approach to not rewriting an entire flash block every time someone touches a variable. The problem was that the platform wouldn't trigger garbage collection until it detected it was out of space, and if you were *very* close to being out of space the firmware would run out of space before the garbage collection code ran.<br>
<p>
There's not actually a good answer here. EFI firmware updates need to be in SMM because that's the only mechanism Intel provide to allow authenticated writes to flash, and SMM can't run without all cores being in SMM, so if you do a variable update and need to rewrite an entire block of flash you're going to halt the OS for long enough that things will be unhappy. Getting into a situation where you allow the OS to make the machine unbootable obviously isn't a great answer to that (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/300747/">https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/300747/</a> is arguably more egregious in this respect), but the singular bug that actually led us to this point is an understandable one.<br>
<p>
(The -ENOSPC behaviour is accompanied by the kernel then attempting to create a variable it knows is too big in order to force the firmware to do a garbage collection run on next boot. If you boot via the UEFI boot stub then the kernel will do this while still in UEFI boot services, which should trigger the garbage collection before the kernel starts. As a result, this *should* now be largely invisible to users without putting systems at risk, but obviously we have no way whatsoever kf knowing how firmware actually works before we try it)<br>

We have had kexec on panic for years.  So this is doable without pstore.<br>
<p>
I am just a little astonished.  Last round this was tested (admittedly with more data because people wanted a kernel core dump) using drivers in the kernel to write to on a kernel panic only worked on developers machines.   Under actual read world failure conditions the kernel was always too compromised to successfully (safely?) write to a block device.<br>
<p>
The listed driver restrictions might be enough to make the code reliable in a crash scenario.   I would love to see a report on their testing.<br>

The IPsec changes are more than just RFC 8229 (TCP Encapsulation of IKE and IPsec Packets) support:<br>
<p>
- RFC 8229 in IPv4 is already supported since Linux 5.6 (see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/811198/">https://lwn.net/Articles/811198/</a> ). It's a great way to establish an IPsec tunnel even if the network only allows ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP like some public hotspots do.<br>
<p>
- RFC 8229 in IPv6 support (ESP/IKE in TCP in IPv6) is new. It helps establishing IPsec tunnels to IPv6 servers even in restricted networks.<br>
<p>
- You now can embed ESP in UDP in IPv6 packets. Once this feature lands in an Android kernel, you can finally use IPsec apps to connect to IPv6-only VPN gateways (direct use of ESP is unavailable to apps). This feature also enables users behind crappy ISP-provided DSL/cable routers to connect to dual-stack or IPv6-only IPsec gateways (quite a lot of those routers drop ESP).<br>
<p>
I have been eagerly waiting for these changes for years. Cisco was able to run IPsec over TCP (admittedly nonstandard, but it worked) for over a decade before Linux got the feature, and they have been marketing it ever since as one of the unique selling points of their IPsec solution. Yes, running e.g. TCP over IPsec over TCP has funny side effects, but it beats not being able to connect at all. Some other VPN solutions (WireGuard) require third-party tooling to run over TCP, but with RFC 8226 support IPsec finally surpasses that.<br>

What's the deal with Android and IKEv2? I have an up-to-date Pixel 3 but there's no native IKEv2 support, AFAICT.  This site, <a href="https://www.watchguard.com/help/docs/help-center/en-US/Content/en-US/Fireware/mvpn/ikev2/mvpn_ikev2_android_client.html">https://www.watchguard.com/help/docs/help-center/en-US/Co...</a>, make it sounds like *some* flavors of Android support IKEv2 out-of-the-box.<br>
<p>
I want to switch over to IKEv2 completely as basic road warrior VPN configurations are simpler--no L2TP, no duplicative auth, etc. It's supported natively by all the common user platforms, including Windows, iOS, and macOS, except Android.<br>

Perhaps they don't think it's important to have built-in because good apps exist? The strongSwan app works very well in my experience (...except for outer IPv6), supports prepared profiles (.sswan files), and so on.<br>
<p>
Native IKEv2 on Windows in contrast is always troublesome for me, to the point I wish it wasn't there and I wouldn't feel bad about installing a standalone client.<br>

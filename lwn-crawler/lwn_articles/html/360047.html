<p>
Sharing code where it is possible is normally considered a good thing, but
there are some limits to what can be shared.  One of the limiting factors
is often license compatibility; GPL code, in particular, often cannot be
combined with code under other licenses and then distributed.  
The kernel is licensed under the GPL, but, since it's rare that anyone
wants to combine its code with user-space applications, license
incompatibilities have not been much of a problem. 

<p>
 There is, however, some
kernel tracing
infrastructure that could be shared with user-space tracing
applications&mdash;likely 
benefiting both&mdash;if those parts of the kernel were available under
more permissive licenses.  Mathieu Desnoyers, who has developed much of
that infrastructure, has set out to <a
href="/Articles/360265/">try to relicense</a> some fairly small portions of the
kernel under dual licenses, so that the code can be shared.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, Desnoyers would like to be able to use the kernel tracing
infrastructure in the <a href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/?q=node/7">Linux Trace
Toolkit Next Generation</a> (LTTng) user-space tracer (UST).  He <a
href="/Articles/360267/">describes</a> the need as follows:

<div class="BigQuote">
The intent is to allow the tracer code developed both on the kernel-side
as part of Ftrace and LTTng and on the userspace side within UST to be
shared when appropriate. As a result, we can consider userland-only
solutions to user-space tracing without rewriting all the kernel
tracing infrastructure from scratch.
</div>
</p>

<p>
All of the files are currently licensed under the GPLv2, but Desnoyers
would like to 
see the C files available under a dual GPLv2/LGPLv2.1 license, and the
header files under a dual GPLv2/BSD license.  In order to do that&mdash;at
least under the most inclusive interpretation of copyright&mdash;he must
get permission for the relicensing from each contributor to those files.
His message to linux-kernel listed the few remaining contributors
that he had 
not yet heard from.
</p>

<p>
The files of interest are <tt>kernel/marker.c</tt> and
<tt>kernel/tracepoint.c</tt>, along with the corresponding header files in
<tt>include/linux</tt>.  For 2.6.32, kernel markers have been removed, with
all users converted over to use trace events, but <tt>marker.[ch]</tt> are
still used by UST.  The idea is that the C files could be
turned into a user-space library that could be dynamically linked to
applications that required it, while the header files (with an even more
permissive license) could be used to add static tracepoints to any
application, proprietary or free.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, the relicensing has been met with approval from the
developers who responded, with several saying that they didn't think their
contributions warranted requiring their approval, but they gave it anyway.
Steven Rostedt ran the C file relicensing by Red Hat's legal department and
was granted permission for all of the Red Hat contributions to be dual
licensed under the GPLv2/LGPLv2.1.  The header file GPLv2/BSD dual
licensing is still pending with Red Hat, according to Desnoyers.
</p>

<p> There are still a few developers who have not responded, but their
contributions are quite small, and could be rewritten rather easily if
necessary.  A bigger stumbling block may be <a
href="/Articles/360266/">opposition</a> from Ingo Molnar, who seems to
consider the relicensing process to be legally dubious: "<q>the
legality of such relicensing is questionable as that code was never
developed outside of the kernel but as part of the kernel</q>".  In
addition, he has technical concerns:

<div class="BigQuote">
But i also disagree with it on a technical level: code duplication is 
_bad_. Why does the code have to be duplicated in user-space like that? 
I'd like Linux tracing code to be in the kernel repo. Why isn't this done 
properly, as part of the kernel project - to make sure it all stays in 
sync?
<p>
So for those two grounds i cannot give my permission for this 
relicensing, sorry.
</div>

</p>

<p>
Whether Molnar's permission is actually required is something of an open
question as his employer (Red Hat) has already given permission for his
work to be relicensed.  But, if there are serious concerns that
lead to a "nack" from him on the relicensing patch, things get rather
murky.  It may be that there is a disconnect between Desnoyers and Molnar
such that Desnoyers's intent is not clear.  As Pierre-Marc Fournier <a
href="/Articles/360368/">points out</a>, not relicensing the code leads to
code duplication as well:
<div class="BigQuote">
So the GPL code will have to be rewritten. And this will result in the
exact same drawbacks you are trying to avoid by being against
dual-licensing. The goal of dual-licensing is to make it possible to
keep the code in sync between kernel and userspace, not the opposite!
</div>
</p>

<p>
Essentially, Desnoyers wants user-space applications to be able to contain
tracepoints that are based on the same code that is used now in the
kernel.  Those applications may be under a variety of free or proprietary
licenses, but the tracepoints are just a static instrumentation technique
that could be shared.  As Rostedt <a href="/Articles/360403/">puts it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
But what I think is trying to be done here is to use the same types of
MACROS that we have in the kernel to do tracing in userspace. That a
userspace program can add their own "TRACE_EVENT" and that the headers
there will create a tracepoint for them the same way we currently do in
the kernel.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Molnar has gone quiet on the topic, as has the thread, but the idea,
overall, seems reasonable.  While it does expose a kernel interface
to user space, it doesn't tie the kernel to any ABI/API for the future.  If the
kernel needs to change, either the user-space libraries will change right
along with it, or there will be a fork.  Given that the players involved
work on both the kernel and user-space sides of the problem, that seems
somewhat unlikely to happen, but it certainly doesn't seem like that split
need happen now.

<p>
I assume there's a bit more there than just the stuff coming from kernel.  <br>
User space libraries might also be built with different toolchains than <br>
kernel[1], so them being built as part of kernel build[2] doesn't sound so <br>
convenient.<br>
<p>
[1] kernel is more picky about compiler versions and it being gcc.<br>
    (although LLVM is getting closer to being able to build kernel)<br>
[2] which I assume being what Ingo proposes here...?<br>

The realtime project has been the source of many of the
innovations that have found their way into the core kernel in the last
fifteen years or so.  There is more to it than that, though; the wider realtime
community is also doing 
interesting work in a number of areas that go beyond ensuring deterministic
response.  One example is Daniel Bristot de Oliveira's <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1621414942.git.bristot@redhat.com/">runtime
verification patch set</a>, which can monitor the kernel to ensure that it
is behaving the way one thinks it should.
<p>
Realtime development in the kernel community is a pragmatic effort to add
determinism 
to a production system, but there is also an active academic community
focused on realtime work.  Academic developers often struggle to collaborate
effectively with projects like the kernel, where concerns about
performance, regressions,
and maintainability have been the downfall of many a bright idea.  As a
result, there is a lot of good academic work that takes a long time to make
it into a production system, if it ever does.
<p>
Imagine, for a moment, a project to create a realtime system
that absolutely cannot be allowed to fail; examples might include a
controller for a nuclear reactor, a jetliner's flight-control system, or
the image processor in a television set showing that important football
game.  In such a setting, it is nice to know that the system will always
respond to events within the budgeted time.  Simply observing that it
<i>seems</i> to do so tends to be considered inadequate for these systems.
<p>
One way to get to a higher level of assurance is to create a formal model
of the system, prove mathematically that the model produces the desired
results, then run that model with every scenario that can be
imagined.  This approach can work, but it has its difficulties: ensuring
that the model properly matches the real system is a challenge in its own
right and, even if the model is perfect, it is almost certain to be far too
slow for any sort of exhaustive testing.  The complexity of real-world
systems makes this approach impractical, at best.

<p>
<h4>Runtime verification</h4>
<p>
The runtime verification patches take a different approach.  Developers can
create a high-level model describing the states that the system can be in
and the transitions that occur in response to events.  The verification
code will then watch the kernel to ensure that the system does, indeed,
behave as expected.  If a discrepancy is found in a running system, then
there is either an error in the model or a bug in the system; either way,
fixing it will improve confidence that the system is behaving correctly.
<p>
The use of this mechanism is described in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/49959c04157ecf7e972551555533b08d70d57bd7.1621414942.git.bristot@redhat.com/">this
documentation patch</a> helpfully included with the code; the following
example is shamelessly stolen from there.  The first step is to express
one's model of an aspect of the system's behavior; the example given is
whether a CPU can be preempted or not â€” a question that realtime
researchers tend to be interested in.  This model is described in the <a
href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT language</a>, making it
easy to use <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to view the
result:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2021/rv-wip.svg" alt="[Graphviz output]"
     width=400>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the preemptive state, a CPU can be preempted by a higher-priority
task.  The preempt_disable event will put the CPU into the non_preemptive
state where that can no longer happen; preempt_enable returns the CPU to
the preemptive state.  A sched_waking event while in the non_preemptive
state will cause the CPU to remain in that state.
<p>
Pretty graph plots can dress up an academic paper (or an LWN article), but
they are of limited utility when it comes to verifying whether the kernel
actually behaves as described in that model.  That might change, though, if
this model could be used to generate code that <i>can</i> help with this
verification.  Part of the patch set is the
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/e569772b0324d425619f10b2dab3c8dde2fc68b7.1621414942.git.bristot@redhat.com/">dot2k
tool</a>, which will read the DOT description and output a set of template
code that may be used for actual verification.  There is, however, some
work that must be done to connect that result to the kernel.
<p>
<h4>Connecting the model to the kernel</h4>
<p>
As a starting point, the template
code generated by <tt>dot2k</tt> contains definitions of the states and
events described in the model:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table><tr><td width="50%" valign="top">
<pre>
enum states {
    preemptive = 0,
    non_preemptive,
    state_max
};
</pre></td><td width=50%" valign="top">
<pre>
enum events {
    preempt_disable = 0,
    preempt_enable,
    sched_waking,
    event_max
};
</pre></td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
From these, a state machine is built to match the model.  Also included are
stub functions that will be called in the kernel when one of the defined
events occurs; for example, the preempt_disable event is given this stub:
<p>
<pre>
    void handle_preempt_disable(void *data, /* XXX: fill header */)
    {
	da_handle_event_wip(preempt_disable);
    }
</pre>
<p>
The developer's job is to complete the prototype of the function to match
how it will be called.  That, in turn, depends on how it will be hooked
into a running kernel.  There is a fair amount of flexibility here; just
about anything that will cause the kernel to call the function in response
to the relevant event is fair game.  The most common case, though, seems
likely to be tracepoints, which already exist to mark the occurrence of
events of interest.  The kernel conveniently provides a tracepoint
that fires when preemption is disabled; its name is, boringly,
"preemption_disable", 
and it provides two parameters beyond the standard tracepoint data called
<tt>ip</tt> and
<tt>parent_ip</tt>.  If our <tt>handle_preempt_disable()</tt> function is
to be hooked to that tracepoint, its prototype must thus be:
<p>
<pre>
    void handle_preempt_disable(void *data, unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip);
</pre>
<p>
Any other stubs must
be fixed up in the same way.  Then, the developer must arrange for the
connection between the handler functions and their respective tracepoints;
the template provided by dot2k makes that easy:
<p>
<pre>
    #define NR_TP   3
    struct tracepoint_hook_helper tracepoints_to_hook[NR_TP] = {
        {
	    .probe = handle_preempt_disable,
	    .name = /* XXX: tracepoint name here */,
	    .registered = 0
    	},
    	/* ... */
    };
</pre>
<p>
By filling in the names of the relevant tracepoints, the developer can
make the connection to the handler functions.  The template also provides
functions that are used to start and stop the model, for cases where any
sort of extra initialization or cleanup is required.  Those functions need
no modification for this simple model.  Finally, dot2k generates a pair of
tracepoints that can be used to watch for events and errors from the model.
<p>
<h4>Running the model</h4>
<p>
The resulting code is then built into the kernel, most likely as a loadable
module.  In a kernel with runtime verification enabled, there will be a new
directory (called <tt>rv</tt>) in <tt>/sys/kernel/tracing</tt> with a set
of control files; these can be used to turn specific models on or off.  It
is also possible to configure "reactors", which perform some action when
the system's behavior diverges from what the model says should happen.  The
default is to do nothing, though the "error" tracepoint will fire in that
case.  Alternatives include logging a message with <tt>printk()</tt>, and
panicking the system for those cases when somebody is especially unhappy
that the system misbehaved.
<p>
Realtime researchers can use this mechanism to check that their models of
the kernel's behavior match the reality.  But it is not hard to imagine
that runtime verification could have much broader applicability than that.
It could be used to monitor the security of the system, ensuring that, for
example, no process enters a privileged state in unexpected places.
Regression testing is another obvious application; a suitably
well-developed model of various kernel subsystems might be able to catch
subtle 
bugs before they become visible at the user level.  The use of DOT to
define the models makes it easy to use them as documentation describing the
expected behavior of the kernel as well.
<p>
The first step, though, would be to get this subsystem into the kernel.  So
far, there have not been many comments posted in response to this work, so
it is unlikely to have seen a lot of review.  As an add-on that should not
bother anybody who is not using it, runtime verification should have a
relatively low bar to get over, so it is not entirely fanciful to imagine
that this work could be merged.  Then there could be some interesting
applications of it that come out of the woodwork.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think that very much depends on what you mean by &quot;football&quot; :-) If it&#x27;s the game most of the world calls football, yes this needs to be a priority for all TV manufacturers! <br>

BUG_ON() and WARN_ONCE() and their friends are ad hoc largely undocumented expressions of an underlying model.   The new work will make the model explicit and encourage discussions about the logic as well as the implementation details.<br>

<p>
The main advantage of an explicit model is that it will express the kernel&#x27;s desired behavior.   BUG_ON() etc. are needed because the kernel&#x27;s actual behavior deviates from the model.   One can envision a future where a patch that addresses the problem that triggers a backtrace would be required to include a diagram illustrating the deviation from the agreed model.    Imagine how much easier such a practice would make reading Linux mailing lists!<br>

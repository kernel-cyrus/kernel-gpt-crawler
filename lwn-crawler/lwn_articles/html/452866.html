<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 25, 2011</br>
           </div>
In May, LWN <a href="/Articles/442355/">examined the "stable pages"
patch</a>, whose intent is to be sure that pages under I/O cannot be
modified (by the kernel or user space) until the I/O completes.  Block I/O is
not the only context in which this kind of problem arises, though; memory
which has been given to the network stack should also be kept stable until
the transmission is complete.  Unfortunately, it is hard to know when the
network stack is truly done with a page, leaving the system open to
possible data corruption problems.
<p>
Ian Campbell <a href="/Articles/452868/">described how things can go
wrong</a> in June.  Imagine a page full of data to be written to a file on
an NFS-mounted filesystem.  The NFS code will put together a network I/O
operation as represented by an <tt>sk_buff</tt> structure (an "SKB") and
pass it into the network stack for transmission.  Perhaps the server is
slow or the network is noisy; one way or another the acknowledgment from
the remote NFS server is slow in coming - slow enough that the network
stack decides to retransmit the request.  While the data sits in the
retransmission queue (perhaps already handed to the interface driver), the
ACK arrives from the server.  The network stack will tell the NFS client
that the operation has completed.  The page used to contain the data to be
written could then be rewritten with some other data - even though that
retransmission is still waiting to go out.  The result could be a
(re)transmission of corrupted data.  This problem is especially acute for
<tt>O_DIRECT</tt> writes - where the application is waiting for the end of
the operation - but it can come up in other situations as well.
<p>
SKBs can have a destructor function, so one would think that it would be
possible to just wait until the network stack finishes with the structure
before releasing the relevant page(s).  But the network stack works in
strange and mysterious ways, and the fact that it has finished with an SKB
does not imply that it is finished with the pages of data referenced by
that SKB.  The "cloning" of SKBs happens often in the network stack, and
pages of data can actually move between SKBs.  The networking code manages
the page reference counts directly, so there is no danger of the data pages
being put to some other use entirely by the system.  But that is not helpful to
higher layers, which have no way to know when it's safe to signal the
completion of an operation.
<p>
Fixing this problem requires <a href="/Articles/452852/">a significant set
of changes</a> to the low-level SKB-handling code.  Ian's patch series
starts by defining a set of helper functions for the tracking of references
to pages from SKBs.  Current networking code calls <tt>get_page()</tt> and
<tt>put_page()</tt> directly; after patching, all of those calls have been
wrapped by functions like <tt>skb_frag_ref()</tt>.  Quite a few changes are
required to get the networking core and in-tree drivers to use these
functions.
<p>
Once that is done, the patch series introduces the concept of a "fragment
destructor" for SKBs:
<p>
<pre>
    struct skb_frag_destructor {
	atomic_t ref;
	int (*destroy)(void *data);
	void *data;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The low-level functions that add fragments to SKBs are modified to take an
additional destructor argument.  The destructor is always optional; code
which does not need to use destructors can simply pass a null pointer
instead.
<p>
At this point, it's a relatively simple matter for the accessor functions
added earlier in the series to increment and decrement the reference count
whenever there are destructors present.  When the reference count
(<tt>ref</tt>) drops to zero, the provided <tt>destroy()</tt> function will
be called.  Putting the reference counter in the destructor is a useful
optimization: in the absence of destructors, the overhead of maintaining
the reference count can be skipped.  Also worth noting is the fact that
multiple fragments in an SKB can share the same destructor; in this case,
the <tt>destroy()</tt> function will only be called when the networking
code has finished with all of those fragments.
<p>
One other optimization is that, in the presence of a destructor, the
network code will no longer increment and decrement the reference counts
associated with the pages in the fragments.  In this situation, the calling
code is assumed to hold a reference for the duration of the operation, so
separate reference counting at that level is not needed.

<p>
The final step is to make use of this capability.  The internal
<tt>kernel_sendpage()</tt> function gains an extra parameter to hold a
pointer to the destructor, should the caller want to use one.  The sunrpc
code is changed to not signal completion of operations until the networking
code indicates that it is done with the associated memory.  And that solves
the problem - for NFS at least; there should be no more troubles with pages
being reused while they are still under network I/O.  There are other
places in the kernel which can - and presumably will - make use of this
functionality in the future; this work was originally motivated by problems
encountered in the implementation of zero-copy I/O for Xen clients.  Ian
suspects that subsystems like iSCSI could also benefit from this mechanism.
<p>
The patch set seems to have been relatively well received.  There will be
another posting at some point reorganizing some of the work, but there does
not appear to be a need for significant changes at this point.  So this
feature seems likely to appear in the 3.2 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

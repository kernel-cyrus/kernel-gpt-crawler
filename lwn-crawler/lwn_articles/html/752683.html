Once a niche feature, memory encryption is becoming mainstream with support
in both Intel and AMD processors, Kirill Shutemov said at the beginning of
his session during the memory-management track of the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.  Memory encryption can harden the
system against attack, but it also presents some interesting challenges for
the kernel.
<p>
Both Intel and AMD use the upper bits of the physical address to mark
encrypted pages, he said.  AMD processors currently only support a single
encryption key, and so use a single bit to
indicate that encryption is in use.  Intel, instead, encrypts all of memory and
uses up to six upper bits to indicate which encryption key is used for each
page.  The default key is marked by all zeroes in that field.
<p>
One interesting challenge is that the CPU's memory caches are based on the
physical address — including the encryption bit(s).  Encryption is handled
by the memory controller, and the same page with two different keys will
look like different addresses to the CPU.  Unless due care is
taken, the same page can thus appear multiple times in the cache under different
encryption keys.  Writing multiple competing cache lines to the same page
will likely corrupt the data there, an outcome that is likely to increase
the overall user 

<a href="/Articles/752714/"><img

title="Kirill Shutemov" class="rthumb"></a>

disgruntlement level.  Avoiding it requires carefully flushing the caches
whenever the encryption status of a page changes to ensure that no 
entries remain under the old key.
<p>
Doing that flush turns out to be expensive.  In an effort to minimize that
cost, Shutemov is looking at adding encryption-key awareness to the page
allocator.  The key that was last used with each page would be remembered;
if the page is allocated to a new use with the same key, there will be no
need to flush any old cache entries.  This can be implemented by putting a
wrapper around the current 
page allocator.  It is worth the effort, he said; otherwise allocation of
encrypted pages can be up to three times as expensive.  Since the
intent is that all of memory will be encrypted, this extra cost could
hurt overall performance significantly.
<p>
One question that arises, though, is: where should the key ID be stored?
It needs to be associated with the <tt>page</tt> structure somehow, and
it must be kept around after the page has been freed.  Ross Zwisler
suggested that 
perhaps pages could be kept in separate pools, one for each key ID.
Shutemov agreed that could be done, but it would involve more significant
surgery to the page allocator.  There was a period of somewhat rambling
exploration of ideas for solutions with no real conclusion reached.
<p>
Hugh Dickins asked how key IDs interact with the buddy allocator, which
will want to join pages with different IDs into larger groupings.  The
buddy allocator ignores the IDs, Shutemov said.  Cache flushing is done
with a single-page granularity, though, so things work as expected.
<p>
For the time being, the key ID is being stored in the <tt>anon_vma</tt>
structure; that means that memory encryption only works for anonymous
pages.  It also is not yet tracking the key ID after pages are freed.  Dave
Hansen said that the search for a permanent home for the key ID is likely
to lead to a challenge all memory-management developers have faced at
one time or another: poring over <tt>struct page</tt> in search of a few
available bits that can be used for this purpose.  For now, though,
Shutemov is looking at storing it in the <tt>page_ext</tt> structure that
is used  for information that doesn't fit in <tt>struct
page</tt>.
<p>
Michal Hocko worried that adding complexity to the page allocator may be a
mistake, especially if memory encryption works better in future CPUs and
this level of tracking is no longer needed.  He also worried that
encryption will add a degree of nondeterminism to the page allocator; the
time required to satisfy a request will vary considerably depending on the
previous
encryption status of the allocated pages.  The networking developers, who
have been working to reduce allocation times, will complain.  It would be
better, he said, to ensure that the cost of using encrypted memory falls on
those who choose to use it.  That suggests just flushing caches when the
memory is freed.
<p>
Shutemov raised another issue: the direct mapping (the portion of kernel
space that, on 64-bit systems, maps directly to all of physical memory)
uses the default key.  But the kernel will often find itself having to
access pages that are encrypted with other keys.  One way to handle that
would be to bring back something like the <tt>kmap()</tt> interface to
create a temporary mapping to a specific page using the appropriate key.
That would be somewhat less efficient than going through the direct
mapping, though, and will hurt performance.
<p>
The alternative is to partition the direct mapping, creating one section
for each possible key ID (of which there are up to 64 in
current hardware).  The promise of this approach is better, he said, but
it's not working yet.  The potential problem is that replicating the direct
mapping in this way will use a lot of virtual address space, reducing the
amount of physical memory that the machine can handle in the process.  But,
by grabbing a set of physical-address bits for the key ID, memory
encryption already reduces the possible amount of physical memory anyway.
The other possible disadvantage is that kernel address-space layout
randomization would have fewer bits to play with.
<p>

The proper API for key management still needs to worked out.  With 64 keys
available, they can't just be handed out to any process that wants one — at
least, not without complicating context switches in unpleasant ways.  The
user-space API is likely to be based on the existing kernel key-management
facilities.  A new <tt>mprotect()</tt> call would be used to apply a key to
a range of memory; doing so will destroy the current contents of the
indicated range.  It would also be nice to have a control-group API at some
point, he said.
<p>
The final challenge discussed was DMA, which also has to work with memory
encryption.  On systems with an I/O memory-management unit,
encryption should just work.  For other systems, it depends on whether the
DMA mask for any specific device can handle the full range of physical
addresses; encryption will just work if that is the case.  Otherwise,
bounce buffers will be 
needed so that the kernel can handle the encryption; that is easy to
implement but slow to run.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems laughable now, but I wonder if someday, somebody will ask why Intel chose to eat up almost 10% of the available address space for the encryption ID bits.<br>

<p>
It may only be 10% of the *address*, but reserving those six bits reduces the available address *space* by 98% (2**58 addresses vs. 2**64). On the other hand, no current AMD64 processor supports physical addresses larger than 48 bits, so there is still room for growth before some other solution will need to be found for storing encryption keys.<br>

      <p>Just to put these numbers into some perspective, we're talking about systems with 16 EiB of virtual address space split into 8 EiB each for user and kernel. This change reduces physical address space from 16 EiB to 256 PiB, where 1 PiB = 1,024 TiB = 1,048,576 GiB. Wikipedia tells me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Recent_implementations">Intel do 64 TiB physical addresses, while AMD do 256 TiB and both are planning 4 PiB</a>, meaning that we've still got a factor of 64 left between Intel's limit and the current planned address space extensions.
<p>I suspect that even with "only" 256 PiB of physical RAM, we'll want to move to 128 bit virtual addresses before we run out of physical address lines; right now, we're only able to handle 256 TiB of virtual address space (48 bits, PML4), while Intel are working on chips with 128 PiB address space (57 bits, PML5). We've got a decent length of time before systems have to support memory spaces this large.

I completely agree with the assessments that we have a long way to go before this becomes a thing, and it probably won't ever be a thing, but those of us who are older remember enough times when $AMOUNT of memory was "enough for the forseeable future" that ended up being a bummer, that we have a knee-jerk chuckle about this one :-)<br>

It does not eat up 10% of the available address space.  MK-TME consumes a variable number of bits from the top of the physical address space.  If it consumed 6 bits, that would mean that we consumed 98.4% of the available physical address space.  But, on 5-level paging systems that have 52 bits of physical address space, that means you still have 46 bits (64TB) of physical address space.  If you want to add more RAM than that, you can, but you would need to give up some of the MK-TME bits.  It's expected that a BIOS could either do this automatically, or let it be end-user-configurable.<br>

Does anyone know why more than one key is useful?  Can the kernel see or change some of the raw keys?<br>

A key per virtual machine, as this whitepaper on AMD SEV (that uses ASID/PCID for selecting encryption key) suggests: <a href="https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2013/12/AMD_Memory_Encryption_Whitepaper_v7-Public.pdf">https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2013/12/AMD_Mem...</a><br>

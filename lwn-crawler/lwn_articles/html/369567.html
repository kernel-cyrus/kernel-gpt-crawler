           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 13, 2010</br>
           </div>
Mathieu Desnoyers is the longtime developer of the <a
href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/">LTTng</a> tracing toolkit. 
A current project of his is to provide for fast tracing of multithreaded
user-space applications; that, in turn, requires a fast, multithreaded
tracing utility.  Tracing is controlled through a shared memory area; to
make that control as fast as possible, Mathieu would like to use the
read-copy-update (RCU) algorithm.  That, in turn, means that he has been
working on porting RCU - a kernel-only technology - to user space.  In the
process, he has run into some interesting challenges.
<p>
As with the kernel version, user-space RCU works by deferring the cleanup
of in-memory objects until it is known that no more references to those
objects can exist.  The implementation must be done differently, though,
since user-space code is unable to run in the same atomic mode used by RCU
in the kernel.  So, in user space, a call to <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> sets
a variable in shared memory indicating that the thread is in an RCU
critical section.  Within that critical section, it's safe for the thread
to access RCU-protected variables.
<p>
...at least, it's safe as long as nobody reorders operations in a way that
causes an access to happen to an RCU-protected variable before the effects
of <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> are visible to other CPUs.  That kind of
reordering can indeed happen, at both the compiler and CPU levels, so it's
a problem which must be addressed.  Compile-time reordering is relatively
easy to avoid, but runtime reordering in the CPU requires the issuing of a
memory barrier instruction.  And, indeed, user-space RCU can be made to
work by putting memory barriers into the <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> call.
<p>
The problem with that solution is that memory barriers slow things down
significantly.  Even worse, they slow down the fast path for a case - a
change to an RCU-protected variable - which happens rarely.  So Mathieu
would like to get rid of that barrier.  To that end, he coded up a solution
which sends a signal to every thread when an RCU-protected variable is
about to be changed, forcing each thread to execute a memory barrier at
that time.  This solution does speed things up, believe it or not, but
signals are almost never the optimal solution to any problem.  Mathieu
would like to do something better.
<p>
His "something better" turned out to be <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/369018/">a simple system call</a>:
<p>
<pre>
    void membarrier();
</pre>
<p>
The initial implementation would simply send an inter-processor interrupt
to every CPU in the system; the receiving CPUs would respond by executing
an explicit memory barrier instruction.  The solution worked, but it ran
into a couple of objections in review:
<p>
<ul>
<li> By allowing a user-space program to force interrupts to all processors 
     on the system, <tt>membarrier()</tt> presented an easy way to create
     denial-of-service attacks on the system.
<p>
<li> The system call interrupted every processor on the system.
     Interrupting processors running different applications is a small but
     useless waste.  The problem gets a little worse if some of those CPUs
     are running realtime tasks, which, presumably, would not welcome the
     forced addition of a bit of latency into their world.  It would even
     interrupt processors which were currently sleeping - a useless
     exercise which would also increase energy use.
</ul>
<p>
What followed was a long discussion on how to optimize the patch, whether
an explicit memory barrier is needed even after the CPU has taken an
inter-processor interrupt (the safe answer appears to be "yes"), and so
on.  All told, an impressive amount of effort has gone into the
optimization of a small patch which is, at its core, implementing the slow
path which should be rarely executed.
<p>
Current status, as of this writing, is that Mathieu has posted <a
href="/Articles/369640/">a new version of the patch</a> with a number of
changes.  The first of those is the addition of an integer
"<tt>expedited</tt>" parameter.  If this value is zero, the system call
simply calls <tt>synchronize_sched()</tt> and returns; this is the cheapest
way of getting the needed functionality, but it comes at the cost of a
latency of some milliseconds for the caller.  It seems clear that Mathieu
expects the "expedited" mode to be used most of the time.
<p>
For an expedited barrier, the system call will look at every CPU in the
system, building a mask of those which are running in the same address
space as the caller; those CPUs will then receive the inter-processor
interrupt asking them to execute a memory barrier instruction.  It's a
rather more complicated implementation, but, since it only interrupts
processors which are running the calling application, the denial of
service, performance, and energy use concerns are no longer relevant.  One
assumes that the patch is getting close to its final form, but it's hard to
say for sure: sometimes it's the smallest and simplest patches which are
scrutinized the most.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Do I understand right that the idea is to make CPUs execute memory barriers only when the variable is changed, as opposed to executing them each time before accessing it?<br>

In essence, yes, the read-side memory barriers are only executed when the updater requires that synchronization. With RCU, we only have to execute the barriers each time a synchronize_rcu() is called, which occurs typically far less often than variable updates.<br>
<p>
Rephrasing what you said: "the idea is to make CPUs execute memory barriers only when synchronization is required by the updater thread, as opposed to executing them each time before and after accessing it from a reader thread".<br>

Thanks,<br>

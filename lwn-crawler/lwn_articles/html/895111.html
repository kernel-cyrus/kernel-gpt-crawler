<p>
It is perhaps unusual to have a kernel tracing developer leading a
filesystem session, Steven Rostedt said, at the beginning of such a session at the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM).  But he was doing
so to
try to find a good way to dynamically allocate kernel data structures
for some of the pseudo-filesystems, such as sysfs, debugfs, and tracefs,
in the kernel.
Avoiding static allocations would save memory, especially on systems
that are not actually using any of the files in those filesystems.
</p>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<a href="/Articles/895267/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lsfmm-rostedt-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Steven Rostedt]" title="Steven Rostedt" width=251
height=300>
</a>

<p>
He presented some statistics on the number of files and directories on one
of his systems in <tt>/sys</tt>, <tt>/proc</tt>, <tt>/sys/kernel/tracing</tt> (the usual mount
point for tracefs), and <tt>/sys/kernel/debug</tt> (debugfs).  In all, he
found 29,384 directories and 290,807 files.  That's a lot of files, but, he
asked, why
should he care about that?
To answer that, he noted that at one point, he had suggested that 
Alexei Starovoitov use tracing instances, which add another set of ring
buffers for trace events and add a bunch of control files in tracefs.  But
Starovoitov tried that and 
complained that new instances used too much memory.  The ring buffers are
fairly modest in size, a bit over a megabyte per CPU, so Rostedt dug in a
bit deeper.
It turns out that 
whenever another instance gets added
to tracefs, it adds around 18,000 files.  Adding up the in-memory size of the inodes and
directory entries (dentries)
shows that 14MB is consumed for each tracing instance that gets added.
</p>

<p>
Looking beyond that, <tt>/sys</tt> consumes 42MB and <tt>/proc</tt> uses a whopping
202MB for these in-memory inodes and dentries, he said.  But David Howells
pointed out that <tt>/proc</tt> does not keep dentries and inodes around.  Rostedt
said that if he can use the same technique as procfs, "my talk is over".  Ted Ts'o cautioned that
it was a procfs-specific hack that had never been generalized, though
Howells thought that perhaps it could be.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Chris Mason looked at a Meta production server to see
what its <tt>/proc</tt> looked like; a <tt>find</tt> from the root took
multiple minutes, and pegged the CPU at 100%, to find that there were 31 million files in it.  He
suggested that the procfs-specific hack "might not be the right
hack" to use.
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner said that since tracefs is its own filesystem, the procfs
technique could simply be used there.  But Rostedt was adamant that he did
not want a hack just to fix the problem for tracefs; he wanted to find a
proper solution that could be generalized for others to use.  There should be a
generic way
for any pseudo-filesystem to opt into a just-in-time mode, where the inodes
and dentries are allocated when the files and directories are accessed.
</p>

<h4>eventfs</h4>

<p>
Rostedt noted that Ajay Kaher gave a <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/11/contributions/1085/">presentation</a> at the
<a href="https://lpc.events/event/11/page/103-lpc-2021-overview">2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a> (LPC) on eventfs, which dynamically allocates the dentries
and inodes for all of the tracing events that appear in tracefs.  It is a
kind of sub-filesystem for tracefs to handle the event files dynamically so
that new instances do not consume so much memory.
It only does the dynamic allocation for the events, and not for the other control
files that appear in tracefs, 
Rostedt said.
He
did some testing with and without eventfs and found that it made a huge
difference.  Creating a new instance without eventfs used around 11MB
extra, while doing that with eventfs only used about 1MB.  At LPC, some
attendees said that the feature is something that should be added as an option
for all
pseudo-filesystems, which is what brought Rostedt to LSFMM.  He wanted to
get a sense for the best way to accomplish this goal and to figure out what
the internal API would look like.
</p>

<p>
In particular, since the event dentries and inodes are only present while
they are being used, at least in eventfs, he is concerned that the API
needs to have a way to keep them in memory while a trace involving them is
running.  The worry is that memory pressure could cause eventfs to be
unable to create the file to disable the event.  David Howells suggested
that an emergency pool could be used to handle that particular problem.
</p>

<p>
Brauner asked which API was used for tracefs; did it use the sysfs API, for
example?  Rostedt said that tracefs has its own API and is completely
separate from any of the other pseudo-filesystems.  Tracefs came about
because people wanted tracing information available on production systems
but did not want to build debugfs into them.  So, at Greg Kroah-Hartman's
suggestion, Rostedt started with the debugfs code and turned it into tracefs. 
</p>

<p>
Since tracefs has its own API, and does not rely on sysfs or kernfs, for
example, that gives it more leeway to define an API for the just-in-time
feature without having to convert the others, Brauner said.  He thinks it
will be difficult to come up with something that could be shared between
tracefs and procfs, however, because procfs is so special.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt said that perhaps tracefs "could be the guinea pig" for the
feature, then other filesystems could convert over in time if that was seen
as useful.  He too
wonders if procfs is too special to fit in, however.  Mason's concern about
procfs being slow because it creates its entries on the fly may also mean
that other filesystems will not want the feature. Howells said with a chuckle that if
Rostedt wanted to thoroughly test the feature, "putting it in procfs would
be one good way to do that".
</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>

<p>
Currently eventfs covers just a portion of the control files in tracefs;
Rostedt would like to handle all of the tracefs files that way.  But the
feedback he has gotten from virtual filesystem (VFS) layer developers is
that this should not be done solely for tracefs, so he was wondering what
the right approach would be.
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein asked if Rostedt had talked with Kroah-Hartman to see if he
would be interested in this feature for debugfs.  It would seem 
that debugfs might also benefit from it.  Rostedt said he had not asked
Kroah-Hartman about that.  But Brauner said that debugfs and
sysfs have an ingrained idea that it is the responsibility of the creator
of the directories and files to clean them up, which is different from the
centralization in eventfs (or something along those lines); it might be difficult to
rework those other filesystems to use a different model.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt is also concerned about race conditions and lock-ordering
problems, based on his review of the eventfs code.  Howells said those
kinds of problems "have all been pretty well sorted in procfs".  Processes
come and go, as do their entries in procfs, even if they are being
used. Procfs has its own structure that describes just the pieces it needs,
he said, and it creates dentries and inodes on demand.  It already deals
with the problem of the process directory going away when the process does,
though files in that subtree may still be open.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt wondered whether he should continue working on eventfs with Kaher
or if they should drop that and try to make it work for all of tracefs.
Eventfs might make a good test case for where the problem areas are.
Brauner asked if there were other users who wanted this functionality,
which might help guide which way to go.  Howells reiterated the idea that
procfs might provide the best model to look at since it already handles
many of the same kinds of problems.
</p>

<p>
Overall, Rostedt said that he was not hearing anyone argue that he should
not continue working on the idea. In addition, he said that he now has some
good ideas of what code to look at as well as
names of people to ask 
questions of.  Patches are presumably forthcoming once he and Kaher
determine the path they want to pursue.

<p>
Is this even slightly surprising?  If procfs doesn&#x27;t keep everything always in the dcache/icache, then the find has to bring everything into the dcache/icache.  This requires allocating all those dentries and inode - at the very least.  If the &quot;multiple&quot; is (say) 5, then I calculate 9 microsecond per file - not too bad.  And of course the CPU will be at 100% - there is no device IO to wait for.<br>
<p>
If you want &quot;find&quot; to be fast, keep everything in the cache and put up with the memory cost.  If you want to save memory, then expect &quot;find&quot; to be slow - the first &quot;find&quot; at least.  The second one should be faster because everything is in the cache.<br>
<p>

<p>
Beware of premature optimisation (the rt of al evl), and premature generalisation.  If you start by trying to create a completely general solution, you are likely to create a monstrosity.  It would be best to look at what procfs has done, and then create something for tracefs which copies the useful lessons but tunes them specifically for tracefs - because tracefs is all you really know.  If  there is some abstraction that would clearly be useful for both, then maybe that would be worth putting in fs/libfs.c.  Then when someone else wants to do the same thing for some other filesystem, they will have two working examples to learn from and will be able to create even more common code.  Incremental development for the win.<br>

<p>
Nope.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If you want &quot;find&quot; to be fast, keep everything in the cache and put up with the memory cost.</font><br>
<p>
But that&#x27;s just plain wrong. Caches only speed up the *second* access and find is generally a single access cold cache workload.<br>
<p>
Indeed, what I find surprising is that nobody seems to recognise that the limit here is find being &quot;100% CPU bound&quot;. That is, find isn&#x27;t automatically multithreading and making use of all the CPUs in the system. Yet find is a trivially parallelisable workload - iterating individual (sub-) directories per thread scales almost perfectly out to either IO or CPU hardware limits.<br>
<p>
e.g. I can run a concurrent find+stat iteration that visits every inode in a directory structure of over 50 million inodes on XFS in about a 1m30s on my test machine before 16+ CPUs are fully CPU bound on inode cache lock contention. With lock contention sorted, it scales out to 32 CPUs and comes down to about 30s - roughly 1.5 million inodes a second can be streamed through the dentry and inode cache before being CPU bound again. <br>
<p>
The inode cache alone on this machine can stream about 6 million cold inodes/s (XFS bulkstat on same 50 million inodes using DONT_CACHE) before we run out of CPU and memory reclaim starts to fall over handling the &gt;10GB/s of memory allocation and reclaim this requires (on a 16GB RAM machine). And even with this sort of crazy high inode scanning rate, the disk is only barely over 50% utilised at ~150k IOPS and 3.5GB/s of read bandwith. <br>
<p>
Modern SSDs are *crazy fast* and we can build machines containing dozens of them and we have the memory bandwidth to feed them all. In memory and pseudo filesystems that use CPUs to do all the processing/IO (and I include PMEM+DAX in that group) are *slow* compared to the amount of cached data we can stream and access via asynchronous DMA directly to/from the hardware. <br>
<p>
So what this anecdote says to me is that this &#x27;find is slow&#x27; problem is caused by the fact our basic filesystem tools still treat systems and storage as if it still is a machine from the 1980s - one CPU and a real slow spinning disk - and so fail to use much of the capability the hardware actually has....<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Beware of premature optimisation (the rt of al evl)</font><br>
<p>
Yup, optimising OS structures because a single threaded find is CPU bound is optimising the wrong thing. We should be providing tools that can, out of the box, scale out to the capability of the underlying hardware they are provided with. There&#x27;s orders of magnitude to be gained by scaling out the tool, optimising for a single CPU bound workload will, at best, gain a few percent. <br>

True, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter _which find_ was used if it only used 100% CPU. A parallel find that was constrained to a single cpu would behave the same.<br>
<p>
FWIW, I do know there are find (and other tool) variants out there that are multi-threaded. I use tools like lbzip2 because compression is another common operation that is trivially parallelisable. The problem is we have to go out of our way to discover and then install multi-threaded tools. It is long past the point where the distros should be defaulting to parallelised versions of common tools rather than they being the exception...<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I use tools like lbzip2 because compression is another common operation that is trivially parallelisable.</font><br>
<p>
There are caveats for complession. Block schemes like bzip2 are trivially parallelisable with increased memory usage (which is quite low anyway) as the only drawback, but Lempel-Ziv and streaming compressors in general may take a hit to compression ratio, at least if done without care.<br>

A colleague once filed a bug ticket with the complaint that &quot;find&quot; on /proc took so long.   &quot;Tell Linus,&quot; I wrote in the comments and marked as &quot;Won&#x27;t Fix.&quot;<br>

/proc probably needs it&#x27;s own specialised finder because of how everything is lumped together.<br>
<p>
net sysctl stuff is very over represented:<br>
golden record in in /proc/sys/net which is effectively copied to /proc/$pid/net, /proc/$pid/task/$pid/net (pid is the same!)<br>
and /proc/$pid/task/$tid/net. Add /proc/*/fd and /proc/*/map_files and it is unbounded.<br>
<p>
&quot;find /proc -type f -inum +4026531839&quot; to search for something not in /proc/$pid/ doesn&#x27;t help with memory problem<br>
because find doesn&#x27;t know to not recurse into top level process stuff.<br>
<p>
Filtering out names full of integers will skip directories in /proc/bus/pci so it is not reliable either.<br>

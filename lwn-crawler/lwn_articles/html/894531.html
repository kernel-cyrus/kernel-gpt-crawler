Memory protection keys are a CPU feature that allows additional access
restrictions to be imposed on regions of memory and changed in a fast and
efficient way.  Support for protection keys in user space has been in the
kernel for some time, but kernel-side protection (often called "protection
keys supervisor" or PKS) remains unsupported â€” on x86, at least.  At the 
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Ira
Weiny provided an update on the state of PKS and led a discussion on what
the proper in-kernel API for PKS should be.
<p>
Weiny began by saying that <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220419170649.1022246-1-ira.weiny@intel.com/">version
10 of his PKS patch set</a> had been posted in April.  It adds additional
protections for kernel-space mappings on x86 systems.  On that
architecture, memory protection keys control read and write access, but cannot affect execute
access.  The permissions set by PKS apply only on the local CPU; that means
that they can changed quickly, with no need for expensive translation
lookaside buffer (TLB) flushes.  PKS protections can apply to persistent
memory as well as normal RAM; the initial goal of Weiny's patch series is

<a href="/Articles/894545/"><img

title="Ira Weiny" class="rthumb"></a>

to <a href="/Articles/883352/">use PKS to protect persistent memory</a>
against stray writes from the kernel.  There is also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210830235927.6443-1-rick.p.edgecombe@intel.com/">a
patch series from Rick Edgecombe</a> that uses PKS to protect page tables
from corruption.
<p>
Protecting memory from unwanted changes by the kernel is a good thing, but
this protection cannot get in the way of legitimate changes.  So PKS
protections must be lifted when such changes are being made.  Trying to
find every site in the kernel where PKS-protected memory is being accessed
would be futile, and the result would be unmaintainable, so Weiny has,
instead, "abused" the <tt>kmap()</tt> interface for this purpose.  But
<tt>kmap()</tt> is not the best tool for the job, for a couple of reasons.
<p>
The <tt>kmap()</tt> API was initially introduced to enable the kernel to
manage (relatively) large amounts of memory on 32-bit processors.  On such
machines, there are not enough available address bits to directly map more
than (usually) about 1GB of memory into the kernel's address space.  The
memory that <i>can</i> be mapped this way was called "low memory", while
all of the memory that could not be directly mapped was "high memory".
When the kernel needs access to a page in high memory, it must first make a
temporary mapping in its page tables; this is done with <tt>kmap()</tt>.
In practice, this means that the kernel must call <tt>kmap()</tt> (or one
of its variants) before accessing any page in memory, and call
<tt>kunmap()</tt> when that access is complete.  In cases where the target
page is in low memory (that would be all pages on 64-bit systems), those
calls do nothing, but they must still be present.
<p>
Thus, <tt>kmap()</tt> would seem to be an ideal interface for adjusting PKS
restrictions.  When the kernel needs to access a page, it will call
<tt>kmap()</tt>, which can suspend any PKS protections for the page in
question on the local CPU; the following <tt>kunmap()</tt> call can then
restore those protections.  The only problem is that <a
href="/Articles/813201/">high memory is going away</a> sooner or later, and
the plan is for <tt>kmap()</tt> to be removed at the same time.  We live in
a 64-bit world now, Weiny said.  There are still some Arm CPUs that need
high memory now, he added, but the writing is on the wall for high memory in
the longer term.
<p>
It would thus be good to find an alternative to using <tt>kmap()</tt>.  One
apparent option is the <tt>page_address()</tt> macro, but that will not
work due to the lack of an unmap operation.  The problem needs to be
solved, Weiny said; PKS is not the last protection scheme of this type that
will come along.  The kernel project needs to establish the rule that code
cannot just access the direct map without making prior arrangements; he
suggests simply redefining <tt>kmap()</tt> to fill this role.  The new
meaning of a <tt>kmap()</tt> call would be "give me a kernel-accessible
address for this page".
<p>
An alternative would be to improve <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.17.6/source/mm/vmalloc.c#L2736">vmap()</a></tt>,
which creates a new kernel-space mapping for a page, for this purpose,
though that would require changing a lot of <tt>kmap()</tt> calls.
Matthew Wilcox said that it should be possible to make <tt>vmap()</tt> more
efficient; there just has never been a driving need to optimize it so far.
Weiny said that could make long-term mappings, for which <tt>kmap()</tt> is
not intended, work better.  Or, he said, the kernel could just eliminate
the direct map entirely and always require memory to be mapped
explicitly, but that approach probably would not perform well.
<p>
Wilcox raised the issue of the <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">"Capability
Hardware Enhanced RISC 
Instructions" (CHERI) architecture</a>, which applies capabilities to all of
memory.  It has a 128-bit address type that provides a lot of space for
access keys and more.  Only FreeBSD supports this architecture currently,
but it is, he said, something that the Linux community should be thinking
about; CHERI-like mechanisms seem likely to show up in other processors
over time.  Supporting PKS can be seen as a small step in preparing for
that world.
<p>
Josef Bacik said that the Btrfs code is currently a heavy user of
<tt>kmap()</tt>, but he does not really care about the API to access kernel
memory.  "Just tell me what to use", he added.  Chris Mason said that Btrfs
developers have a debugging patch that makes pages read-only so that they
can look at the resulting crashes and see who is modifying pages when they
shouldn't be.  PKS would be a useful way to implement this functionality.
<p>
Wilcox suggested that there should be an interface that can change the
protections on multiple pages.  Some sort of <tt>kmap_local_range()</tt>
function would be useful.
Bacik agreed, saying that Btrfs often has
to map 16KB metadata blocks.  It would be easy, he said, to change over to
a new API that did the job better.  At that point time ran out and the
session came to a close.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 4, 2008</br>
           </div>
Back in February, LWN published <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/268783/">a
discussion of the <tt>vmsplice()</tt> exploit</a> which showed how the
failure to check permissions for a read operation led to a buffer overflow
within the kernel.  Subsequently, a linux-kernel reader <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/269532/">pointed out</a> that the article
stopped short of a complete explanation: this is not an ordinary buffer
overflow exploit.  Travel schedules and such prevented the writing of an
immediate followup, but your editor would still like to tell the full
story.  So this article picks up where the last one left off and describes
how the <tt>vmsplice()</tt> exploit makes use of this buffer overflow to
take over the system.
<p>
When <tt>vmsplice()</tt> is being used to feed data from memory into a
pipe, the function charged with making it all happen is
<tt>vmsplice_to_pipe()</tt>, found in <tt>fs/splice.c</tt>.  It declares a
couple of arrays of interest:
<p>
<pre>
    struct page *pages[PIPE_BUFFERS];
    struct partial_page partial[PIPE_BUFFERS];
</pre>
<p>
<tt>PIPE_BUFFERS</tt>, remember, is 16 on exploitable configurations.  Both
of these arrays are passed into <tt>get_iovec_page_array()</tt>, which, as
described in the previous article, makes a call to
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> to fill in the <tt>pages</tt> array.  As a result
of the failure to check whether the calling application is allowed to read
the requested region of memory, <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> will overflow the
<tt>pages</tt> array, writing far more than <tt>PIPE_BUFFERS</tt> pointers
into it.  These are, however, pointers to legitimate kernel data
structures; it remains to be seen how this overflow enables the attacker to
take control of the system.
<p>
The <tt>partial</tt> array is also passed into
<tt>get_iovec_page_array()</tt>; it describes the portion of each page which
should be written into the pipe.  To that end, a loop like this is run
immediately after returning from <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i &lt; error; i++) {
	const int plen = min_t(size_t, len, PAGE_SIZE - off);
	partial[buffers].offset = off;
	partial[buffers].len = plen;
	/* ... */
    }
</pre>
<p>
Since full pages are being written in this case, the calculated offset will be zero, and the length
will be <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> (4096).  The value of <tt>error</tt> is the
return value from <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>; that will be the number of
pages actually mapped: 46, in the case of the exploit.  Remember that the
<tt>partial</tt> array is also dimensioned to hold 16 entries, so this loop
will overflow that array as well.
<p>
Both of these arrays are declared, one right after the other, in
<tt>vmsplice_to_page()</tt>.  A quick test by your editor suggests that the
<tt>partial</tt> array will be placed below <tt>pages</tt> in memory, so,
once <tt>partial</tt> is overflowed, the loop will start overwriting
<tt>pages</tt> instead.  So the <tt>pages</tt> array will end up containing
alternating values of zero and 4096 rather than the real <tt>struct
page</tt> pointers it had before.  (It's worth noting that the exploit
still works if the arrays are placed in the opposite order, since the
overflow causes code down the line to think that <tt>pages</tt> is larger
than it really is).
<p>
Once all this has happened, control returns to <tt>vmsplice_to_pipe()</tt>
- the overflow is not big enough to have overwritten the return address.  A
call to <tt>splice_to_pipe()</tt> is supposed to finish the job, but
something interesting happens there.  Toward the beginning of this
function, this test is made:
<p>
<pre>
    if (!pipe-&gt;readers) {
	send_sig(SIGPIPE, current, 0);
	if (!ret)
	    ret = -EPIPE;
    	break;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Looking back at <a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/5092">the exploit
code</a>, we see that it closes the read side of the pipe before calling
<tt>vmsplice()</tt>.  So <tt>splice_to_pipe()</tt> will quit almost
immediately.  On its way out, however, it does this:
<p>
<pre>
    while (page_nr &lt; spd_pages)
	page_cache_release(spd-&gt;pages[page_nr++]);
</pre>
<p>
The call to <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> will have locked each of the relevant
pages into memory to allow the kernel to work with them; this is the
cleanup code which goes back and unlocks the pages which will not be used.
But remember that the pointers in the <tt>pages</tt> array have been
overwritten, and are now either zero or 4096.  What would normally happen
here is a kernel oops, since those are not legitimate addresses.  The
exploit code has done something tricky, though: using some special
<tt>mmap()</tt> calls, it has created some anonymous memory at the bottom
of its address space.  
<p>

Directly dereferencing user-space addresses while running in kernel mode is
frowned upon for a number of reasons; it can blow up in a number of ways.
But, if the address is valid and the relevant page is resident in memory,
direct access to user-space memory will work.  So, when the kernel starts
to work with the addresses that it thinks are <tt>struct page</tt>
pointers, it does not get any sort of fault; instead, it gets the data
placed in that memory by the exploit.  Needless to say, that data has been
arranged carefully.

<p>

The Linux kernel normally manages each page as an independent object.
There are times, however, when pages are grouped into larger units, called
"compound pages."  This generally happens when physically contiguous
allocations larger than one page are needed by the kernel; when this
happens, a compound page is passed back to the caller.  These pages are
special in that they must be split back apart when they are released back
into the system, and there may be other cleanup work to do.  So
compound pages have an attribute not found on normal pages: a destructor
which is called when the page is freed.
<p>
So, if we look at how the exploit sets up its low-memory <tt>page</tt>
structures, we see:
<p>
<pre>
    pages[0]-&gt;flags    = 1 &lt;&lt; PG_compound;
    pages[0]-&gt;private  = (unsigned long) pages[0];
    pages[0]-&gt;count    = 1;
    pages[1]-&gt;lru.next = (long) kernel_code;
</pre>
<p>
When the kernel looks for a <tt>page</tt> structure at user-space address
zero, it will find something which looks like a compound page.  The
destructor (stored in the <tt>lru.next</tt> field of the second
<tt>page</tt> structure) is set to <tt>kernel_code()</tt>, a function
defined within the exploit itself.  Since the <tt>count</tt> is set to one,
the call to <tt>page_cache_release()</tt> (which decrements that count)
will conclude that there are no further references and, since the page looks like
a compound page, the destructor will be called.  At this point, the exploit
has arbitrary code running in kernel mode, and the show is truly over.
This code just sets the process's <tt>uid</tt> to zero (giving it root
access), then engages in some assembly-language trickery to return
immediately to user space, shorting out the rest of the cleanup process. 
<p>

There are a couple of interesting implications from all of this.  One, clearly,
is that this exploit is not something which was bashed out by a script
kiddie somewhere.  It was written by somebody who understands low-level
kernel code quite well and who is able to use that understanding to
escalate an apparent information-disclosure vulnerability into a full code
execution problem.  It is, clearly, a mistake to underestimate those who
write exploits, not all of whom immediately make their works known to the
development community.  One also should not  assume that they have not
already written exploits for other, still unfixed bugs.
<p>

Also worth noting is the fact that ordinary buffer overflow protection may
well have not been effective against this vulnerability.  The return address on
the stack was not overwritten, and no exploit code was put in data areas.
This episode has caused a renewed interested in technical security measures
in the kernel.  These measures are good, but it would be a mistake to think
that they will fix the problem.  What is really needed is stronger review
of patches with security in mind; it is not yet clear to your editor that
this review is happening.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wouldn't be surprised if this was the result of some tool that assembles exploits out of
constraint violations. It wouldn't be hard to have a program that lists exploits for cases
where the kernel thinks that some particular data structure is in memory that's either
provided by the userspace or in user address space, which could pick up on what line of what
function gets an oops in the zero page. If somebody's got such a program, it would just be a
matter of noticing that a bad value causes an oops, and running the exploit generator.

Someone not a script kiddie clearly wrote the tricky part of this exploit, but may have
written it to exploit an entirely different bug, and left it somewhere that someone entirely
different could find it to generate a quick proof that the oops that came up with a simple
invalid input was actually exploitable.

      The indentation of the <tt>break</tt> line was clearly wrong (and different from the real code), I fixed it.
<p>
As for indent depth, I routinely shorten it in code samples to make the result fit in the browser window.  The original code uses full-tab indents.

I did notice the consistent 4-character indents elsewhere.  I was being a tad tongue-in-cheek
because of the apparent irony.  (It was clear that the 'break' statement was the odd man out.)

good job Jon, now only one thing is missing: the behaviour on 32 bit vs. 64 bit archs (in
practice that'd be i386 vs. amd64). the issue here becomes clear when one looks at struct
partial_page and realizes that its first two members are int, not long, therefore when
treating them as a struct page *, the userland address the kernel will go to isn't a mere NULL
or PAGE_SIZE anymore (something mmap_min_addr could have protected against) but a high enough
address that makes it indefensible.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Also worth noting is the fact that ordinary buffer overflow protection may </font>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; well have not been effective against this vulnerability. The return address</font>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; on the stack was not overwritten, and no exploit code was put in data </font>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; areas.</font>

Has there been any talk about extending NX (no-execute) style page
protection to within kernel space itself, to prevent it from executing
code residing in user-space pages?

The UDEREF feature of PaX prevents the kernel from accessing userland memory directly and has
been doing so for 2 years now, close to a year before the vulnerability class ever became
public.  It makes use of segmentation on x86 to accomplish this, so due to Linus' rules it
will never be accepted into the mainline kernel.

If you're interested, I had posted this information earlier regarding UDEREF to some mailing
lists, courtesy of the PaX Team:

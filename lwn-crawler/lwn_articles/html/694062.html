           <p>July 13, 2016</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p>In the <a href="/Articles/693027/">first part of this series</a> we explored the complexities of charging a
battery in a portable Linux-driven device from a USB connection, and
in particular looked at how the maximum allowed current can be
determined.  This resulted in five tasks that Linux
would need to complete in order to charge batteries in a compliant
manner.  It is now time to look inside Linux to see how well it
achieves these tasks and, as we will find, the answer is &quot;not very
well&quot;, or at least &quot;not very uniformly&quot;.  There is some reason for hope
on the horizon, however, as a patch set described as providing a &quot;usb
charger framework&quot; is under development and should close at least some
of the gaps.</p>

<p>The five tasks we identified, and that we will address in order, are:</p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li>find out from the USB PHY what type of cable is attached and
report this to the battery charger</li>
<li>advertise USB gadget configurations with appropriate power demands</li>
<li>determine which gadget configuration was chosen and report the
available power to the battery charger</li>
<li>adjust current within the given range to maintain suitable voltage</li>
<li>detect when the power supply is questionable during boot, and limit
activation of components until that is resolved</li>
</ul>

<h4>The EXTernal CONnector in your USB PHYsical interface</h4>

<p>When a cable is plugged into the B-series USB receptacle on your
device, it is the task for the PHY, and the Linux driver for the PHY, to
measure voltage levels and resistances to determine what sort of
cable has been plugged in.  The PHY driver must then tell the USB core
code if it should start negotiations as a USB host or a USB gadget;
it must also report the cable type to whatever driver is responsible
for charging the battery.  How these reports are sent could best be
described as <em>ad hoc</em>, though a less kind commentator might say it is a
total mess.  There are two approaches that are fairly generic: one
legacy and one newer.  And then there are non-generic approaches
like <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/musb/musb_core.c?id=a99cde438de0c4c0cecc1d1af1a55a75b10bfdef#n1683"><code>musb_mailbox()</code></a>.</p>

<p>The legacy approach requires that the charger call
<code>usb_register_notifier()</code>, as eight charger drivers do.  The <a href="/Articles/160953/">notifier</a>
mechanism allows a pointer to an arbitrary data structure to be passed
along with the notification.  Some PHY drivers pass a pointer to an
integer giving the available current in mA, some pass a pointer to the
<code>usb_gadget</code> structure, which doesn't contain any information about
available current, and some just pass <code>NULL</code>.  Even without any data
passed, the notification can be useful since the charger driver may be able to
query the PHY directly, and can almost certainly turn the charging
circuit on or off depending on whether there is any voltage.  So, while
this is not a coherent interface, it does provide some value.</p>

<p>The newer approach is to use &quot;extcon&quot;, which is a driver
class for 
monitoring external connectors, whether for audio jacks, video ports,
USB receptacles, or anything else.  An extcon device maintains a record
of what type of cable (or what collection of cables) is currently
plugged in and will generate a notification whenever a cable is
plugged or unplugged.  Other drivers can register interest in a
particular cable type being attached to a particular connector or in
a particular cable type being attached to any connector.  Strangely,
there is no way to register interest in a particular connector
regardless of cable type.</p>

<p>Among <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/extcon.h?id=a99cde438de0c4c0cecc1d1af1a55a75b10bfdef#n30">the cable types known to extcon</a> are:</p>
<pre>
        /* USB external connector */
        #define EXTCON_USB		1
        #define EXTCON_USB_HOST		2

        /* Charging external connector */
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_SDP	5	/* Standard Downstream Port */
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_DCP	6	/* Dedicated Charging Port */
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_CDP	7	/* Charging Downstream Port */
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_ACA	8	/* Accessory Charger Adapter */
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_FAST	9
        #define EXTCON_CHG_USB_SLOW	10
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no documentation beyond what is given above and
the implicit documentation of how various drivers use the cable types.
<code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_SLOW</code> seems to suggest a cable that can provide
500mA.  <code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_FAST</code> is used by
<tt>axp288_charger.c</tt> to indicate 
a charger capable of 2000mA.  The relationship between the
<code>EXTCON_USB*</code> and <code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_*</code> cable types seems confused.</p>

<p>A possible interpretation is that the <code>EXTCON_USB*</code> cable types
indicate if a cable can carry data, either in gadget or host mode,
independent of any charging capabilities.  The <code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_*</code>
types would then indicate the power that can be expected of the cable,
independent of any data.  Thus a single USB cable might be
reported as both a data cable and a power cable, which certainly makes
it easier for any client that is only interested in one or the other.
A few drivers, such as <tt>extcon-max14577.c</tt>, report a standard downstream
port as both <code>EXTCON_USB</code> and <code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_SDP</code>, which supports this
hypothesis, but, since they don't report <code>EXTCON_USB</code> together with
<code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_CDP</code> or <code>EXTCON_USB_HOST</code> together with
<code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_ACA</code>, this is not an interpretation that can
safely be 
relied upon.</p>

<p>Even though these cable definitions do not seem to be implemented
consistently, there is infrastructure available that carries all the
information we need.  Updating some drivers to use existing
infrastructure properly is a trivial task compared to trying to work
out what infrastructure is needed to allow the drivers to communicate at
all.</p>

<p>And, indeed, drivers would need to be updated.  There are precisely two
charger drivers that listen for extcon notifications.  Quite a few USB
drivers listen for <code>EXTCON_USB</code> or <code>EXTCON_USB_HOST</code> so they can
configure as a gadget or a host, but the only chargers that do are
<tt>axp288_charger.c</tt> and <tt>charger_manager.c</tt>.</p>

<p>It is from <tt>axp288_charger.c</tt> that we can discover the one
interpretation of <code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_FAST</code> and
<code>EXTCON_CHG_USB_SLOW</code> that was mentioned above, but 
otherwise it isn't particularly helpful as the code doesn't appear to
work.  The API for extcon was updated last year and when
<tt>axp288_charger.c</tt> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4b703b1d4c46ca4a00109ca1a391943ec21991b3">was adjusted to match</a>, the only improvement
provided was the removal of compiler errors.</p>

<p><tt>charger_manager.c</tt> is a software battery-charge monitor that checks
the temperature and voltage on a battery and decides when to try to
charge it.  It can be configured to expect a list of different cable
types along with the current to try to use from each cable.  This
seems to be the closest thing to a working charger manager that uses an
extcon device to be notified of cables.</p>

<p>This poor state of the code doesn't necessarily mean that no Linux
device charges properly over USB.  The USB PHY and the charging controller
in a particular device are often from the same manufacturer and even
in the same integrated circuit.  In these cases, a driver for one half
can have intimate knowledge of the other half and thus achieve reasonable
results.  An example of such a driver is <tt>isp1704_charger.c</tt>.  This
driver is ostensibly a driver for battery charging, but it reaches over
into the territory of the PHY driver to
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/power/isp1704_charger.c?id=a99cde438de0c4c0cecc1d1af1a55a75b10bfdef#n97">directly
access &quot;ULPI&quot; registers</a>, which is the USB Low Pin
Interface.  It uses <code>usb_register_notifier()</code> to find out when
something changes, then pokes around on its own to see the specifics
of the change.</p>

<p>Where I have mentioned &quot;charger drivers&quot; above I have been a little
loose with terminology.  Linux doesn't have a &quot;battery charger&quot; class
for drivers, it only has a &quot;<code>power_supply</code>&quot; class.  The unifying feature
of this class is that it allows drivers to report various details of a
power source, such as voltage (both present and maximum), current,
capacity (for batteries), technology used, etc.  Since the most important
aspect of charging a battery is managing the source of power, and possibly
turning it off when temperature or voltage monitors indicate a
problem, it is quite reasonable for battery charging to be managed by
power supply devices, and this is how it happens in Linux.</p>

<p>One of the properties a power supply can present is the supply type,
and until 2010 it was one of battery, UPS, mains, or USB.  At that time
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=85efc8a18cedf70e55acd0c825e2d9d2f3b19999">USB
DCP, USB CDP and USB ACA were added</a>.  More recently, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6659b55dae09b2042d8cdd0f4576502c3e81957c">some
more types specific to USB&nbsp;3.0 have been added</a>.  This means
we have two subsystems vying for ownership of the USB-charger-type
concept.  Is the type of charger plugged into a USB receptacle a
property of the power supply, or a property of the cable (or external
connection)?  Or both?  The &quot;technology&quot; property mentioned previously
is currently used only for batteries, allowing NiMH, LION, NiCd,
etc.  If the power supply needs to know about the attached charger,
rather than just being told the available current, should the various
types be treated in the same way as battery technology?  While it is
doubtless possible to argue for various different options, it is hard
to argue against having unified coherent usage and that is certainly
missing.</p> 

<p>The various USB power supply subtypes are currently used in three
different drivers.  The <tt>axp288_charger.c</tt> that we have already met uses
some of the values, but just uses them internally.  It doesn't use
them to report the type of the power supply (that is always
<code>POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_USB</code>) but <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/power/axp288_charger.c?id=a99cde438de0c4c0cecc1d1af1a55a75b10bfdef#n165">stores them in a data structure called
<code>cable</code></a>.  It finds out the type of charger by registering with
an extcon device, but as already noted that doesn't work correctly.
So that driver isn't good example to learn from.</p>

<p>Then there is a <tt>gpio-charger.c</tt>, which is designed to work with power-supply hardware with limited monitoring options: a GPIO input can
detect if the charger is active, but that is all.  In order to provide
the other properties that a power supply should have, <tt>gpio-charger.c</tt>
reads some configuration information from a device-tree description of the
hardware. 
It allows that description to declare that the power supply is some
particular subtype of USB.  But this type is not changed dynamically, so
it could only be meaningful for a USB charger that was hardwired to the
device, which seems a little pointless.</p>

<p>Finally there is the <tt>isp1704_charger.c</tt>.  As mentioned, it is a
power-supply driver that pokes in the USB registers to determine
the power-supply type, which is a bit of a layering violation.  So it seems
that no power-supply driver in mainline actually uses the USB power-supply
subtypes in a particularly useful way.</p> 

<p>So let's move on to determining current usage during bus enumeration.</p>

<h4>Tracking gadget configuration</h4>

<p>When a Standard Downstream Port (SDP) connection is detected, the PHY
driver notifies the USB gadget
controller, which then proceeds with the enumeration process.  The
parts of this that interest us are how  <code>MaxPower</code> values are chosen
and how the <code>MaxPower</code> from the chosen configuration is communicated.
<code>MaxPower</code> is the field in a USB configuration table that lists the
current requirement, which can be seen using:
<pre>
    lsusb -v | grep MaxPower
</pre>    

<p>Linux provides a &quot;composite&quot; gadget design where a number of different
drivers can each register their own configuration and the composite
driver will provide a list of all of those configurations to the host
for it to choose from.  There is a serial driver, an ether driver
for networking, a mass_storage driver, and several others.  Each of
these just provides a single configuration and, while a few do set the
<tt>MaxPower</tt> field in that configuration, most just leave it as the
default.  This default can be set using the compile-time configuration
option <tt>CONFIG_USB_GADGET_VBUS_DRAW</tt>.  This option defaults to 2mA,
which is the smallest non-zero number that can be represented; zero is
technically legal but apparently confuses some hosts.
<tt>CONFIG_USB_GADGET_VBUS_DRAW</tt> is 
the sort of number that doesn't really make sense as a configuration
option, but was probably implemented that way because it was easier
than finding a real solution.  No attempt is made to offer multiple
versions of each configuration with different power requirements as
was suggested in the previous article.</p>

<p>It may be possible to offer multiple configurations by a different route.
The composite USB gadget can be configured at runtime using
<code>configfs</code>.  As <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/LinuxConNA2013-andrzej.pietrasiewicz-usb-gadget-configfs_0.pdf">these slides [PDF]</a> describe, it is possible
to create multiple configurations and set the <tt>MaxPower</tt> for each.  This
interface could be used to create multiple configurations for each
driver, but that does feel a little roundabout and clumsy.</p>

<p>Whatever configuration is created, once it has been chosen by the host,
the core USB gadget driver will report this information to the
hardware-specific gadget driver by calling the <code>vbus_draw()</code>
method on 
that driver.  Of those gadget drivers that actually provide a
<code>vbus_draw()</code> method (some don't) and don't simply ignore the value
(several do), most just call <code>usb_phy_set_power()</code> to tell the PHY
driver what power is available.  If that sounds like passing the buck
to you, I would agree.  Most PHY drivers just ignore
the number too.</p>

<p>One exception is the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/gadget/udc/s3c2410_udc.c?id=4c2e07c6a29e0129e975727b9f57eede813eea85#n1508"><tt>s3c2410_udc.c</tt>
USB gadget driver</a> used in the 
GTA02, which is the original OpenMoko phone.  It calls a function provided
by the 
&quot;board&quot; file that contains specifics of the particular platform.  The
GTA02 board file <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/mach-gta02.c?id=4c2e07c6a29e0129e975727b9f57eede813eea85#n221">uses a private mechanism to pass the number to the
power manager</a>.  It is probable that out-of-tree drivers in
vendor kernels use a similar approach.</p>

<h4>Setting the right current</h4>

<p>Once the current that might be available has been determined and
communicated to the charging manager, it is necessary to configure the
charging power supply with an appropriate current, preferably the
highest permitted current that doesn't cause the voltage to drop too low.
As far as I can tell from exploring the code, there is only one driver
that tries anything more sophisticated than setting a fixed current
level, possibly dependent on the type of cable or <code>vbus_draw()</code>
setting.  That driver is the <tt>twl4030_charger.c</tt> that drives the battery
charger in the OpenPhoenux GTA04; I know about that driver, and its
imperfections, because I wrote the code to control the current.</p>

<p>The code in this driver increases the current requested in steps of
20mA until the voltage drops to 4.75V or until the maximum permitted
is reached.  This process mostly works, but subsequent reflections
revealed a problem.  If the battery is fully charged, then the phone
as a whole cannot make use of more that a few hundred mA, so
increasing the current setting won't actually put more load on the
power supply, and thus won't cause the voltage to drop.  This could lead
to the current request being set to the maximum permitted even if it
exceeds the maximum available.  The charging hardware stops feeding
current to the battery when the battery voltage reaches a certain
level and the battery will be allowed to power at least some of the
hardware.  After the voltage drops a little, the charging turns back on,
and at this point the battery may be able to accept more current than
it could when the available current was being measured.  This current
might overload the charger.</p>

<p>The main point about this code is that it is easy to get wrong, but in
principle should be common to all chargers that can limit current and
measure voltage. So it really belongs in a common location — but
where?  There do seem to be a number of different elements of
functionality needed for USB charging and they are currently
implemented in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner.  Bringing it all under a common
umbrella appears to be the goal of USB charger framework that is
currently being developed by Baolin Wang; it was <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/1/35">recently posted in its 15th 
revision</a>.</p>

<h4>The USB charger framework</h4>

<p>The framework attaches a &quot;usb charger&quot; object to every USB gadget
device that is created and intercepts the <code>vbus_draw()</code> calls so that
it knows when an SDP has been configured.  If the USB gadget device is
described in the device-tree as having an &quot;extcon&quot; connector
attached, it 
will register for notifications for cable-change events.</p>

<p>Other drivers, such as a charger driver, can register to receive
notifications from a USB
charger if they know the name of the charger.  The name will always be
<code>usb-charger.0</code> unless there are multiple chargers.  When any change
happens to the charger, it will notify all registered listeners to tell
them the new current limit.  This limit is a single number, not a
range, so it needs to be handled carefully.

<p>
If charger managers were
required to increase the current gradually up to this level, then
sending the maximum would be appropriate.  If they were expected to
always enable exactly this number, then sending the minimum is the
only safe approach.  In the default configuration, the framework
advises a current limit of 1500mA for the various types of chargers.
This is the maximum for some, but not all, cable types.  The only
example of a charger driver that has been modified to use this
information simply sets the limit rather than carefully ramping up to
the limit.  This may be safe, but only if that hardware has its own built-in
current ramping.</p>

<p>When the framework registers interest in an extcon, it only requests
notification of <tt>EXTCON_USB</tt> cables, not the various charger cables.
When that notification arrives, it checks with the configured power
supply to see what USB subtype it is and reports available current
based on that.  So this framework seems to have sided with USB cable
types being the property of the power supply rather than the property
of the cable.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>While most of the parts needed for compliant USB charging are present,
they are 
not implemented consistently, and it isn't even entirely clear what
the right approach should be even if the USB charging framework does
get merged.  That wasn't the answer I was hoping for when I started
examining this issue, but does at least clarify the current
situation.  Knowing where we stand makes moving forward a lot easier.</p>

<p>The one question I haven't yet covered is the need to keep most
devices off until a stable source of power is assured.  The reason for
keeping this separate is that it is unlikely to ever be a part of
Linux.  There are enough interdependencies between discovery of
different devices in Linux that trying to delay some in unusual
circumstances is likely to lead to hard-to-diagnose problems.

<p>
Since the device is encouraged to avoid any unnecessary tasks until power
is stable, it makes sense to not even boot Linux straight away.  U-Boot,
a common boot loader for mobile devices, is sufficiently powerful to be
able to handle all the necessary negotiation to enable the maximum
current possible.  It should then be able to enter a low-power state
until the battery has reached a sufficient charge to carry all the
way through the Linux boot process.  Linux will likely turn off battery
charging during boot and renegotiate from scratch, so the battery needs
enough charge to get all the way through the boot on its own.

<p>
There is clearly plenty to do to get USB charging into a healthy state.
A particularly valuable first step would be to get clarity on how extcon
and <tt>power_supply</tt> devices should work with the different cable
types, and 
then to provide a standard way for charging power supply devices to ramp
up the load while maintaining adequate voltage.  With these in place,
individual drivers could be updated to use these newly clarified
interfaces on an as-needed basis.  It's just a small matter of programming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Ye gods.  Unbelievably complex, and no mention of the myriad of extra options USB-C brings.<br>

Unbelievably complex and *almost entirely non-functional*, don't forget.<br>
<p>
I do wonder how much of this is because the 'new' API is almost entirely undocumented. How can you expect anyone to use your API right if you don't document it or its proper use at all? "grep for driver uses" only works if all the drivers are exploiting every corner-case of the API, or at the very least if none are using it wrong. This requires every future driver implementor to produce perfect bug-free code: one mistake and people will copy the buggy driver and soon you have this mess. But of course 100% bug-free code is a reasonable minimum requirement, right? It's much easier than spending five minutes writing a few comments describing the interface in more detail, and means that Neil gets to spend countless hours trying to read your mind across time, which is no doubt much more fun for him than reading docs would be!<br>
<p>
(Really, I *cannot* understand what goes through kernel developers' heads when they decide to design an API for general use, like this one, and then not document it at all. Surely it's not "I can't be bothered"? Maybe they're all non-native-English speakers and the language barrier is just too high?)<br>

      We're just hoping if we keep doing this then we'll troll you into writing it.

Heh. I tried that once. It doesn't work because nobody else can be bothered to figure out how something works, and nobody else knows the *rationale* for the development choices either, which are often crucial to document (indeed, Neil has a few questions in this very article which are more or less rationale questions and which even perfect knowledge of how it works now could not answer).<br>
<p>
Of course everything I write nowadays is perfectly documented ahead of time and why has my nose grown so long that it's getting in the way of my typing?<br>

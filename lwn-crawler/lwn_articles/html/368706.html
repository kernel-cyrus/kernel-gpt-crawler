<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 5, 2010</br>
           </div>
The sysctl mechanism has seen a lot of work in recent kernel development
cycles, resulting in the removal of a lot of code and a reduction in big
kernel lock usage.  It turns out, though, that this work has also introduced some
subtle and rare race conditions into the handling of string data exported
to user space.  In response, Andi Kleen has put together a new concept
called "RCU strings," using the read-copy-update mechanism to eliminate the
races without the introduction of new locks on the read path.
<p>

There are a number of strings managed through sysctl.  As an example,
consider <tt>request_module()</tt>, which is used by kernel code to ask
user space to load a module.  A call to <tt>request_module()</tt> will
result in an invocation of <tt>modprobe</tt>, but nobody wants to wire
the name or location of <tt>modprobe</tt> in kernel code.  So the sysctl
variable <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</tt> is used to contain the location
of this utility.  It will be set to "<tt>/sbin/modprobe</tt>" on almost any
Linux system, but an administrator can change it if need be.
<p>

Consider the case of a <tt>request_module()</tt> call which happens at
exactly the same time as a change to <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</tt>
from user space.  It is entirely possible that <tt>request_module()</tt>
could end up with the path to <tt>modprobe</tt> which has been partially
modified.  The most likely result is a failed attempt to load the module,
but worse things could happen.  This situation is well worth avoiding.
<p>

(One should note that these races are not, in general, potential security
problems.  The changing of sysctl variables is a privileged operation, so
it cannot be done from arbitrary user accounts.)
<p>

The read-copy-update mechanism was designed to ensure that data -
especially data which is frequently read but rarely modified - remains
stable while it is being used.  So it seems well suited to the protection
of sysctl strings which, likely as not, will never be changed over the
lifetime of the system.  RCU can be a bit tricky to use, though; the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/368684/">RCU 
string type</a> is designed to make things a bit easier.
<p>

The creation of an RCU string is accomplished through:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/rcustring.h&gt;

    char *alloc_rcu_string(int size, gfp_t gfp);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>size</tt> parameter should be the maximum size that the string can
be - null byte included.
<p>
Following the normal RCU pattern, read access to this string is
accomplished by way of a pointer to that string.  Atomic readers - those
which do not sleep - need only use <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> and
<tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> to mark their 
use of the RCU-protected pointer.  Any code which might sleep will have to
take other measures, since the string could change while the code
is not running.  In this case, a copy of the string should be made with:
<p>
<pre>
    char *access_rcu_string(char **str, int size, gfp_t gfp);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>str</tt> is a pointer to the string pointer, and <tt>size</tt> is
the size of the originally-allocated string.  Using <tt>strlen()</tt> to
get <tt>size</tt> would be a serious mistake, since the string could
possibly change before the copy is made.  The new string is allocated with
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>; the given <tt>gfp</tt> flags are used for the
allocation.  The copied string should be freed with <tt>kfree()</tt> when
it is no longer needed.
<p>
Code changing an RCU string should use <tt>alloc_rcu_string()</tt> to
allocate a replacement string, copy the data into it, then use
<tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt> to make the new string visible to the rest of
the system.  The old string should be passed to <tt>free_rcu_string()</tt>,
which will use RCU to free the memory once it is known that no references
to that string can still exist.
<p>
String variables tend to be exported through sysctl using
<tt>proc_dostring()</tt>.  To make life easier, Andi has added a new
function, <tt>proc_rcu_string()</tt>, which handles most of the details of
exporting an RCU string.  It's a simple matter of initializing the
appropriate <tt>ctl_table</tt> structure with a <tt>char&nbsp;**</tt>
pointer to the string pointer and setting the <tt>proc_handler</tt> entry
to <tt>proc_rcu_string()</tt>.  The initial value of the string is allowed
to be a compile-time constant string; anything else is expected to be an
RCU string.
<p>
This code has been through a couple rounds of review and seems likely to be
merged in the 2.6.34 development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
this is a non-sequitur. the premise for exploitation is the occurance of the race, regardless of who triggers it or when it is triggered. so unless there's some guarantee that during the race the partially modified strings can never actually be abused (say, by never pointing to a path controlled by an unprivileged user), there's always a potential security problem, however small or theoretical (or not so theoretical, think of the suid coredump bug and how it was 'fixed').<br>
<p>
also one would hope that in 2010 A.D. 'int size' doesn't pass review.<br>

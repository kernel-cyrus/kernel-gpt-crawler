<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 6, 2013</br>
           </div>
The kernel's <a href="/Articles/185666/">locking validator</a> (often known
as "lockdep") is one of the community's most useful pro-active debugging
tools.  Since its introduction in 2006, it has eliminated most
deadlock-causing bugs
from the system.  Given that deadlocks can be extremely difficult
to reproduce and diagnose, the result is a far more reliable kernel and
happier users.  There
is a shortage of equivalent tools for user-space programming, despite the
fact that deadlock issues can happen there as well.  As it happens, making
lockdep available in user space may be far easier than almost anybody might
have thought.  
<p>
Lockdep works by adding wrappers around the locking calls in the kernel.
Every time a 
specific type of lock is taken or released, that fact is noted, along with
ancillary details like whether the processor was servicing an interrupt at
the time.  Lockdep also notes which other locks were already held when the
new lock is taken; that is the key to much of the checking that lockdep is
able to perform.  
<p>
To illustrate this point, imagine that two threads each need to acquire two
locks, called <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/lockdep/lockdep1.png" width=472 height=42
alt="[Cheesy lock diagram]">
</blockquote>
<p>

  If one thread acquires <i>A</i> first
while the other grabs <i>B</i> first, the situation might look something
like this:


<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/lockdep/lockdep2.png" width=472 height=42
alt="[Cheesy lock diagram]">
</blockquote>
<p>

Now, when each
thread goes for the lock it lacks, the system is in trouble:

<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/lockdep/lockdep3.png" width=472 height=42
alt="[Cheesy lock diagram]">
</blockquote>
<p>

Each thread will now wait forever for the other to release the lock it
holds; the system is now deadlocked.  Things may not come to this point
often at all; this deadlock requires each thread to acquire its lock at
exactly the wrong time.  But, with computers, even highly unlikely events
will come to pass sooner or later, usually at a highly inopportune time.
<p>
This situation can be avoided: if both threads adhere to a rule
stating that <i>A</i> must always be acquired before <i>B</i>, this
particular deadlock (called an "AB-BA deadlock" for obvious reasons) cannot
happen.  But, in a system with a large number of locks, it is not always
clear what the rules for locking are, much less that they are consistently
followed.  Mistakes are easy to make.  That is where lockdep comes in: 
by tracking the order of lock acquisition, lockdep can raise the
alarm anytime it sees a thread acquire <i>A</i> while already holding
<i>B</i>.  No actual deadlock is required to get a "splat" (a report of a
locking problem) out of lockdep,
meaning that even highly unlikely deadlock situations can be found before
they ruin somebody's day.  There is no need to wait for that one time when
the timing is exactly wrong to see that there is a problem.
<p>
Lockdep is able to detect more complicated deadlock scenarios than the one
described above.  It can also detect related problems, such as locks that
are not interrupt-safe being acquired in interrupt context.  As one might
expect, running a kernel with lockdep enabled tends to slow things down
considerably; it is not an option that one would enable on a production
system.  But enough developers test with lockdep enabled that most problems
are found before they make their way into a stable kernel release.  As a
result, reports of deadlocks on deployed systems are now quite rare.
<p>
Kernel-based tools often do not move readily to user space; the kernel's
programming environment differs markedly from a normal C environment, so
kernel code can normally only be expected to run in the kernel itself.  In
this case, though, Sasha Levin noticed that there is not much in the
lockdep subsystem that is truly kernel-specific.  Lockdep collects data and
builds graphs describing observed lock acquisition patterns; it is code
that could be run in a non-kernel context relatively easily.
So Sasha proceeded to put
together <a href="/Articles/536366/">a patch set</a> creating a lockdep
library that is available to programs in user space.
<p>
Lockdep does, naturally, call a number of kernel functions, so a big part
of Sasha's patch set is a long list of stub implementations shorting out
calls to functions like <tt>local_irq_enable()</tt> that have no meaning in
user space.  An abbreviated version of <tt>struct task_struct</tt> is
provided to track threads in user space, and functions like
<tt>print_stack_trace()</tt> are substituted with user-space equivalents
(<tt>backtrace_symbols_fd()</tt> in this case).  The kernel's internal
(used by lockdep) locks are reimplemented using POSIX thread ("pthread")
mutexes.  Stub versions of 
the include files used by the lockdep code are provided in a special
directory. And so on.  Once all that is 
done, the lockdep code can be built directly out of the kernel tree and
turned into a library.
<p>
User-space code wanting to take advantage of the lockdep library needs to
start by including <tt>&lt;liblockdep/mutex.h&gt;</tt>, which, among other
things, adds a set of wrappers around the <tt>pthread_mutex_t</tt> and
<tt>pthread_rwlock_t</tt> types and
the functions that work with them.  A call to <tt>liblockdep_init()</tt> is
required; each thread should also make a call to
<tt>liblockdep_set_thread()</tt> to set up information for any problem
reports.  That is about all that is required; programs that are
instrumented in this way will have their pthreads mutex and
rwlock usage checked by lockdep.
<p>
As a proof of concept, the patch adds instrumentation to the (thread-based)
<tt>perf</tt> tool contained within the kernel source tree.
<p>
One of the key aspects of Sasha's patch is that it requires no changes to
the in-kernel lockdep code at all.  The user-space lockdep library can be
built directly out of the kernel tree.  Among other things, that means that
any future lockdep fixes and enhancements will automatically become
available to user space with no additional effort required on the
kernel developers' part.
<p>
In summary, this patch looks like a significant win for everybody involved;
it is thus not surprising that opposition to its inclusion has been hard to
find.  There has been <a href="/Articles/536373/">a call</a> for some
better documentation, explicit mention that the resulting user-space
library is GPL-licensed, and a runtime toggle for lock validation (so that
the library could be built into applications but not actually track locking
unless requested).  Such
details should not be hard to fill in, though.  So, with luck, user space
should have access to lockdep in the near future, resulting in more
reliable lock usage.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Last year I created a lock dependency analyzer called Locksmith which provides the same kind of functionality.  The immediate motivation was to help debug some C++ open source projects at my company, Cloudera.<br>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/cmccabe/lksmith">https://github.com/cmccabe/lksmith</a><br>
<p>
I've been trying to get more people interested in it, but I have a day job and I don't have a ton of time to devote to this.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to give a talk on it at a conference or two this year.<br>
<p>
I admit I only skimmed this patch set, but from a first glance the differences are: they require an init() call, whereas my library does not, they're GPLv2 only, whereas my library is BSD.<br>
<p>
Another tool that can be used to debug these kinds of problems is helgrind, from the awesome valgrind suite of tools.  helgrind has some limitations, though: for example, the documentation urges you not to use condition variables because it doesn't support them.  Also, helgrind runs your program rather slowly.<br>
<p>
I think one thing that is important for a lot of projects is the ability to roll their own locks and have them be instrumented.  For example, if you rolled your own locks with futexes or atomic instructions, you need some way to notify your lock debugging library of what you've done.  (I received this request from one potential Locksmith user).  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that it's going to be difficult to do that in your GPLv3/BSD/proprietary program if it means linking against GPLv2-only source like liblockdep.<br>

I have to admit I completely agree with both points raised:<br>
<p>
 1. We need an init call.<br>
 2. This is GPL code.<br>
<p>
This is why I've sent another patch series couple of hours before this article was published that first eliminates the need in init calls, and then allows liblockdep to be used as a LD_PRELOAD library.<br>
<p>
In essence, it means that both problems are solved: you don't need to call anything in your code to start liblockdep, and if you don't want to link with it, you don't have to!<br>
<p>
You can now have liblockdep test code from the outside, without being compiled in your program. For example:<br>
<p>
  "lockdep perf sched record"<br>
<p>
will now run a lockdep analyzed perf doing it's usual sched recording work.<br>

Well, it sounds like a fun hack.  I'll have to try it when I get more time!<br>
<p>
I have a bunch of features I've been planning on adding to Locksmith, but I'm pretty busy right now so it will be a few weeks probably.<br>
<p>
What would be even better is to see this kind of functionality implemented at the libc / pthreads level.<br>

Hey Sasha,<br>
<p>
It would be nice if one could modify the output stream of liblockdep (currently it spits its output to stdout).<br>
<p>
How about adding liblockdep_set_stream(FILE *) to achieve the above?<br>

No init call is needed with the LD_PRELOAD approach that the 'lockdep' user-space utility provides: you simply run 'lockdep &lt;yourapp&gt;' on an unmodified binary and it will automatically pick up pthread mutex locking patterns and do lockdep validation.<br>
<p>
If you want to permanently link it into your application then it obviously needs to be license compatible with the kernel's lockdep code.<br>

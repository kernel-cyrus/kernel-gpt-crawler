<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
Few topics have been debated longer in memory management circles than the
out-of-memory (OOM) killer.  This unloved kernel subsystem is invoked when
memory pressure reaches desperate levels; its job is to kill one or more
processes in the hope of enabling the system to continue functioning.  The
problem, as always, is in the choice of which processes to target.  At the
2013 LSFMM Summit, Glauber Costa and Greg Thelen led an inconclusive session
on how that targeting might be improved.
<p>
The current OOM killer targets processes based on their "OOM score," an
indication of both the memory demands created by each process and the
system's view of how important the process is; see <a
href="/Articles/391222/">this article</a> for details on the current
algorithm.  Every process has an <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> value that can be
used to tweak its score relative to that of other processes; in this way,
the system 
administrator can implement a policy directing the OOM killer's attention
toward (or away from) specific processes.  This mechanism falls short of
what some administrators would like, though, since it has no awareness of
memory control groups.  It works in a single, flat namespace of all
processes.  Memory control groups encapsulate a better understanding of the
process tree, but they aren't able to implement OOM policies.
<p>
Jörn Engel noted that the OOM killer as it was initially implemented was
quite stupid, but at least it was predictably so.  It has gotten quite a
bit more complicated since then, to the point that it's hard to know how
the system will respond to OOM situations.  The result of this complexity
is that the OOM killer tends to work well for
whoever last tweaked the kernel's target selection policies, but not
necessarily for anybody else.
<p>
That led to one of the key questions raised in this session: should OOM
handling be moved to user space?  That would allow for the creation of
arbitrarily complex policies under administrator control.  The problem with
this approach is that it is tremendously hard to be sure that a user-space
OOM daemon will actually be able to do its job when the time comes.  One
can lock its full address space into memory, but it is difficult to do
anything in user space under the constraint that no memory may be allocated
at all — and that is just the constraint that will apply in an OOM
situation.  
<p>
There are also interesting policy questions related to user-space OOM
killers.  For example, how long should 
the kernel wait for a user-space OOM daemon to free some memory before
taking matters into its own hands?  John Stultz pointed out that not
everybody sees OOM the same way; Android's low-memory killer wants a
notification 
of a low-memory situation long before it reaches a critical stage, since it
needs to be able to clean up processes before they start adversely
affecting the performance of the system.
<p>
Glauber would like to see a more flexible way to set policies in the kernel
instead.  If nothing else, he said, killing a single process might not be
the right thing to do; it might be better to just kill all processes
contained within a memory control group instead.  In that way, an OOM kill
would more closely simulate a system crash (from the affected group's point
of view) instead of leaving that group
limping along without some of its members.
<p>
Mel Gorman said that, no matter what policy is chosen, somebody will always
want something different.  He saw a few options that the kernel could
pursue to try to make more people happy:
<P>
<ul>
<li> Create a global OOM notification mechanism that can be used by 
     processes like the Android low-memory killer.
<p>
<li> Create some sort of internal OOM hook in the kernel that would be
     available to loadable modules or, perhaps, SystemTap scripts.
     Administrators could then load whatever policy suited them best.
<p>
<li> Add a framework by which a policy could be described to the kernel,
     similar to how firewall rules or packet filters are handled in the
     network stack.
</ul>
<p>
From there, the discussion wandered, revisiting a number of the above
topics without leading to any real conclusions.  It seems likely that the
OOM killer will continue to be the subject of debate indefinitely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems like there are a few standard types of processes that could implement a policy with the kernel which would allow the process to be shut down until conditions improve.<br>
<p>
Server processes might provide a "stub" of code that allows active ports to remain active but return a standard protocol response to requests rather than denying requests altogether.<br>
<p>
It might also be useful for processes to be swapped out completely, and reactivated only when the system decides it can do so. It would then also redirect the active ports off the "stub" and back to the main process.<br>
<p>
Other kinds of processes are harder to decide on a policy. This "stub" idea would probably not work with graphical apps, but there may be other classes of processes where it would work.<br>
<p>
I was also wondering if it would be possible to set up a system where the kernel would only run processes that have OOM policies set up. Then there would be no "rogue" processes in an otherwise harmonious mix of apps with policies.<br>

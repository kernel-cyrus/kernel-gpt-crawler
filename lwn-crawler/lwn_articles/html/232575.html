<h1>UIO: user-space drivers</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 2, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The concept of supporting user-space drivers has appeared on this page a
few times before.  It's back; this time there is a version of the patch
(now called "UIO") which is being proposed for inclusion into 2.6.22.  The
interface has changed somewhat, so another look is called for.
<p>

Like the previous version, UIO does not completely eliminate the need for
kernel-space code.  A small module is required to set up the device,
perhaps interface to the PCI bus, and register an interrupt handler.  The
last function (interrupt handling) is particularly important; much can be
done in user space, but there needs to be an in-kernel interrupt handler
which knows how to tell the device to stop crying for attention.
<p>

The kernel module includes <tt>&lt;linux/uio_driver.h&gt;</tt>.  If it's a
driver for a PCI device, it should register itself as a PCI driver in the
usual way.  When it comes time to connect a device (perhaps in the PCI
<tt>probe()</tt> function), the driver fills in a <tt>uio_info</tt>
structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct uio_info {
	char			*name;
	char			*version;
	struct uio_mem		mem[MAX_UIO_MAPS];
	long			irq;
	unsigned long		irq_flags;
	void			*priv;
	irqreturn_t (*handler)(int irq, struct uio_info *dev_info);
	int (*mmap)(struct uio_info *info, struct vm_area_struct *vma);
	int (*open)(struct uio_info *info, struct inode *inode);
	int (*release)(struct uio_info *info, struct inode *inode);
	/* Internal stuff omitted */
    };
</pre>
<p>

Here, <tt>name</tt> is the name of the device and <tt>version</tt> is the
driver version (which will show up in sysfs).  The number of the interrupt
used by the device (if any) goes into <tt>irq</tt>, with <tt>irq_flags</tt>
being the flags which will be passed to <tt>request_irq()</tt>.  The
function which handles interrupts is <tt>handler()</tt>.  This handler
should acknowledge the interrupt; it usually does not need to do anything
else.  The
<tt>mmap()</tt>, <tt>open()</tt>, and <tt>release()</tt> functions are
called from the equivalent <tt>file_operations</tt> members.
<p>
The <tt>mem</tt> array describes any memory areas which can be mapped into
user space.  The <tt>uio_mem</tt> structure looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct uio_mem {
	unsigned long addr;
	unsigned long size;
	int memtype;
	void __iomem *internal_addr;
	/* ... */
    };
</pre>
<p>
For each mappable area, <tt>addr</tt> is the relevant address, and
<tt>size</tt> is the size of the area.  If it's an I/O memory area,
<tt>internal_addr</tt> is the address returned by <tt>ioremap()</tt>.  The
<tt>memtype</tt> field describes what the area really is:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>UIO_MEM_PHYS</tt> indicates that <tt>addr</tt> is a physical
     address, generally for an I/O memory area.
<p>
<li> <tt>UIO_MEM_LOGICAL</tt> is memory in the kernel logical address
     space, such as that returned by <tt>kmalloc()</tt>.
<p>
<li> <tt>UIO_MEM_VIRTUAL</tt> is memory in the kernel virtual address space
     - the space used by <tt>vmalloc_user()</tt> and friends.
</ul>
<p>
Once the structure is filled in, the driver stub passes it to:
<p>
<pre>
    int uio_register_device(struct device *parent, struct uio_info *info);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>parent</tt> pointer tells the kernel which "real" device is
associated with the UIO device; if the driver is for a PCI device,
<tt>parent</tt> will be <tt>pci_dev-&gt;dev</tt>.
<p>
There is not much more to the kernel-space UIO API.  When a device goes
away, the driver should call:
<p>
<pre>
    void uio_unregister_device(struct uio_info *info);
</pre>
<p>
The final function of note is:
<p>
<pre>
    void uio_event_notify(struct uio_info *info);
</pre>
<p>
Its purpose is to notify the UIO core that an event (typically an
interrupt) has occurred.  The stub driver need not call
<tt>uio_event_notify()</tt> for real interrupts, but it can be used to
simulate interrupts in other situations.
<p>
On the user space side, the first UIO-handled device will show up as
<tt>/dev/uio0</tt> (assuming a normal <tt>udev</tt> setup).  The user-space
driver will open the device.  Reading the device returns an <tt>int</tt>
value which is the event count (number of interrupts) seen by the device;
if no interrupts have come in since the last read, the operation will block
until an interrupt happens (though non-blocking operation is supported in
the usual way as well).  The file descriptor can be passed to
<tt>poll()</tt>.
<p>

The memory areas described by the kernel-space driver can be mapped into
user space with the <tt>mmap()</tt> call.  The interface is just a little
strange: the <tt>offset</tt> value passed to <tt>mmap()</tt> should be
<i>N</i> times the page size for the <i>N</i>th memory area.  So, on a
system with 4096-byte pages, the first memory area will be found with an
offset of zero, the second at 4096, the third at 8192, etc.  Once that is
figured out, though, everything is pretty straightforward.
<p>

There are some limitations, of course.  UIO drivers are char drivers; there
is no provision for creating user-space block or network drivers at this
time.  It is not possible to set up DMA operations from user space.  But,
for drivers which can be implemented with I/O memory access and simple
interrupt handlers, the necessary pieces are in place.  The patch set
includes an example driver to show how it all works.  <a
href="/Articles/232582/">According to Thomas Gleixner</a>, the original,
fully in-kernel version of the driver had to implement 68 different
<tt>ioctl()</tt> commands and was over 5,000 lines long.  The associated
user-space code was over 3,000 lines as well.  The new driver eliminates
all of that, with a total of 156 lines of kernel code and just under 3,000
lines in user space.
<p>

Andrew Morton has <a href="/Articles/232583/">expressed some
reservations</a> about the patch:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm a bit uncertain about the whole UIO idea, really.  I have this
	vague feeling that we'd prefer to encourage people to move device
	drivers into GPL'ed kernel rather than encouraging them to do
	closed-source userspace implementations which will probably end up
	being slower, less reliable and unavailable on various
	architectures, distros, etc
</div>
<p>
The authors respond that it's not really about doing proprietary drivers,
though some of that will undoubtedly go on.  There's a number of people,
especially in the embedded space, who want to do user-space drivers, for
prototyping purposes if nothing else.  The UIO framework gives them a
relatively safe and standard way to write these drivers, which is seen as
being better than having them each create their own kernel hooks.  The
patch has not been merged as of this writing, but, unless stronger
objections arise, it's chances of getting into 2.6.22 are reasonably good.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm with you. It sounds more like an excuse than a real reason.<br>
<p>
This dangerously seems like an atempt to be able to create proprietary drivers and bypass the GPL.<br>
<p>
On one hand I understand the good of having user-space drivers, but on the the other hand I don't see how that can be done and not create this loophole.<br>

      So what if people do use it to bypass the GPL?  Developers were doing user-space drivers *anyway*.  And doing it badly in most cases.<br>
<p>
It depends on if your goal is to write an excellent, open OS kernel or to force all software in the world to become GPL.<br>

The kind of user-space drivers people were doing don't compare with the drivers you will be able to do, even if you probably can't do a user-space graphics driver.<br>
<p>
Also note that I'm not a GPL zealot, but I agree with the "doomsday scenario for linux in a binary world" (OTOH I don't buy the "stable API nonsense").<br>
<p>
Other than that, I don't have problems running the nvidia drivers at my home PC (the few games I still play need 3D).<br>

Companies which do not want their work to become GPL'ed just need to make 
a tiny little "wrapper" driver inside the kernel, and then implement 
everything that matters in the userspace. In some (not to say many) 
scenarios, this approach actually is much better and saner than 
implementing everything in the kernel driver. 
 
BTW, one thing "home Linux users" should remember is that Linux is not 
strong in the home PCs as it is strong in the server market. Many 
companies in that scenario do not care about openess of some driver, as 
long as it works and/or you (the seller) fix it in case it breaks. 
Sometimes they prefer not having the source code and buy from someone who 
is more expensive, because the solution is better and more complete. 
 
IMHO, keeping this UIO infrastructure out of the kernel fearing a "binary 
takeover" would be like keeping FUSE out of the kernel fearing 
"proprietary filesystems" from taking over Linux: something we should not 
be afraid of. 
 
And that's it.

      As one of the main authors of UIO I can tell you that license issues were <br>
never an important topic in our discussions. Our judge and jury is Greg <br>
Kroah-Hartman, who is certainly not in favor of proprietary drivers. Our <br>
target audience are programmers in industry, who have to write a driver <br>
for an exotic card that could never make it into mainline. They're neither <br>
kernel experts nor do they write good code (they don't have the time). <br>
With UIO, they can let somebody else write the 150 lines of kernel code, <br>
which _has_ to be GPL, and the big part can be done in userspace, with the <br>
same tools and knowledge needed for their application, anyway. Yes, in <br>
userspace it's possible to choose a different license, but that's not <br>
UIO's fault or intention. It's been like this since Linux exists.<br>

      Hear hear -- and may I also add that there are lots of specialized little hardware widgets that need software control that simply do not present a character- or block- device paradigm.  If your widget is some bizzare one-shot FPGA interface or the like, the existence of this kind of infrastructure is huge help.  Thanks much!<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; This dangerously seems like an atempt to be able to create proprietary drivers and bypass the GPL.</font><br>
<p>
 Probably only me, probably because IANAL, but I fail to see how an UIO driver would not be a derivative work of the kernel.<br>
That would obviously be different if this interface was implemented in *BSD, Solaris, Windows... but I do not see that being the intent.<br>
And implementing a GPL layer to connect a non-GPL driver would not change that the non-GPL driver is a derivative work of a GPL driver, which is a derivative work of the kernel.<br>
 Now if the law were applied...<br>

if it was then every windows program would be derived from windows (after all, what other OS implements those system calls? SAMBA doesn't count as it is explicitly a copy of the windows API)<br>
<p>
<p>
as such the license of the kernel is irrelevant for UIO simply because it is userspace and is using the defined interface.<br>

      Yes. And if it's an in-kernel driver, they either violate the GPL and/or <br>
hack up something completely unmaintainable. UIO gives them the <br>
possibility to do the dirty part of the driver in user space, and it can <br>
simply become a part of their application. They can use the tools they <br>
know, and don't have kernel version issues. And they can choose any <br>
license they want for the userspace part. BTW, all userspace drivers I'm <br>
aware of are GPL.<br>

      <p>Some printer drivers are implemented in userspace and are not GPL.</p>

<p>The Samsung monstrosity <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/242072/">recently covered by LWN</a> is one such example. Another is the CUPS filter &amp; backend shipped with the Xerox CentreWare suite, which is a living fossil, complete with dropping its self into random bits of /usr .</p>

<p>This issue concerns me too. On one hand, I'd prefer a closed source driver to no driver much of the time. On the other hand, if it's a bad driver it's not much better than no driver at all, and lacking the ability to fix or debug it because it's just a binary blob would be seriously annoying.</p>

<p>Hopefully this won't lead to a large surge in closed source userspace drivers. Still, if it does, at least they'll have to work harder to bring the machine down.</p>

      It should also be easier to reverse-engineer a userspace driver by just watching what it does. What is *really* nasty are binary drivers with a dependency on a specific (usually 3-years obsolete) kernel version.<br>
<p>
For example, I bought an expensive ($500) fast 32-bit parallel I/O card 4 years ago, which claimed to have Linux support. This turned out to be "but only on RedHat 7.3 with the default kernel". In the end, we threw out the hardware. Actually, we replaced it with another "Linux-supported" hardware item, called a QuickUSB. This also had only a binary driver, but it used libusb, and we were able to reverse-engineer it to write a GPL-driver. (But it still wasn't good enough in the end).<br>

I think Andrew Morton's concern is reasonable, maybe user mode driver is used mainly for closed-source drivers. We need to encourage people to free their software!<br>

It seems that UIO has made its way into the kernel code, so this discussion may be moot. But I just have a question: why not just require polling I/O in userspace?<br>
<p>
If you can memory-map to RAM on the PCI bus now, you could just mmap() to a buffer under the driver's control instead. It could have not only device RAM, but also a flag for "interrupt occurred", which the application would clear, and a kernel space interrupt handler would set. You don't need a userspace interrupt handler at all.<br>
<p>
"But that would be incredibly slow!" Yes, it would. And if you want more drivers for Linux, but don't want proprietary ones taking over, then offer a choice: userspace, closed source, and slow; or kernel space, open source, and fast. If that hardware engineer doesn't know about kernel hacking, then he should make it open source, and it will be fixed by people who know the kernel inside out. That's the idea behind an open-source project, right?<br>
<p>
However, for those less political, UIO does seem a good solution.<br>

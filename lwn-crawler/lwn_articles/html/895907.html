<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
On the second day of the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Goldwyn Rodrigues
led a 
combined filesystem and memory-management session on saving memory when
reading files that share extents.  That kind of sharing can occur with
copy-on-write (COW) filesystems, reflinks, snapshots, and other features
of that sort.  When reading those files, memory is wasted because multiple
copies of the same data is stored in the page cache, so he wanted to
explore adding a cache
specifically to handle that.
</p>

<p>
When two files share an extent, their inodes point at the same data blocks
on the disk, though they seem to be completely independent files.  When
those files are read, each gets copied separately into 
the page cache. That wastes memory, but there are also other costs: reading
from the disk, computing checksums, decompressing, and so on.
</p>

<p>
His idea is to create a device cache ("not a buffer cache" because that would
cause nightmares, he said) within
the page cache that would only store a single copy of these pages.
His <a href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1634933121.git.rgoldwyn@suse.com/">RFC
implementation</a> back in October used the inode of the device special
file of the underlying device, rather than that of the file in the
filesystem, to store the shared extents in the page cache.
He
described how the cache would work for multiple scenarios (buffered read,
buffered write, direct I/O, and 
<tt>mmap()</tt>), starting with the simplest. 
</p>

<a href="/Articles/896057/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lsfmm-rodrigues-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Goldwyn Rodrigues]" title="Goldwyn Rodrigues" width=212
height=300>
</a>

<p>
A buffered read would check the page cache for the file and, if the page is not
found there, it would calculate the device offset from the read offset in
the file and look in the shared-extent cache to see if the page lives there.  If
not, it would read the data from the disk and add it to the shared-extent cache.
Buffered writes would always go to the page cache, because any write ends
the sharing of the extent.
For writes of a
partial page, though, the shared-extent cache would be checked for the rest of the data
for that page.
</p>

<p>
The harder problem is for direct I/O (DIO), because a shared-extent cache kind of
defeats the purpose of DIO, which is to circumvent the page cache.  But if
the shared-extent cache were used, DIO writes would need to check that cache and
remove pages from it since the extents would no longer be shared.  But
Matthew Wilcox cautioned that even for reads, DIO needs to actually go to
the disk because of shared storage, where some other machine may have
written to the device.  In addition, there are applications that are trying to save CPU
cycles and want the DMA from the device to occur; the alternative is to
copy the data out of the shared-extent cache using the CPU and
"to that application, CPU
is more important than bus bandwidth".  Rodrigues said that changes in
shared storage will require invalidating the caches across the cluster. 
</p>

<p>
Supporting <tt>mmap()</tt> is "sort of a gray area for me", he said; he is
not sure that his way to do so is the right one.  There is a
read-only mapping for the shared pages and any writes to those pages will
result in a page fault that can handle the COW operation.  
</p>

<p>
He wondered if there should be some kind of differentiation for reads that
are targeting shared extents or whether all reads should go through the new
cache.  Josef Bacik said that he thinks it should just be a new kind of
inode that, for Btrfs, maps to its logical byte-number addressing, rather
than to anything device-specific.  From there it is just treated like any
other inode, so, for example, the memory-management (MM) subsystem can ask the
filesystem to shrink its inode cache and these cache objects would just be
handled normally.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, Bacik does not want to see this as a mount option as it was in
the RFC patch set, "death to all
mount options"; it should just always work, he said.  For Btrfs, he thinks
that all reads should go to the new cache because a snapshot could happen
at any time.  For DIO, the page cache entries should just be invalidated
and applications using DIO will not get the benefit of this feature 
</p>

<p>
There is a question of how the cache gets flushed, since closing the file
does not mean that others are not using the pages or won't soon, Rodrigues
said.  Maybe it makes sense to wait until the inode is evicted.  But Bacik
said that the starting point should be to not flush these pages at all and
let the MM subsystem evict pages as needed.  It will not reach the point of
an out-of-memory (OOM) condition because the MM will tell the filesystem to
invalidate pages before that happens.
</p>

<p>
There are some questions, he said, about how to share a single page across multiple
mappings for different inodes; how does the system ensure that the COW
happens when writes are done and how does the page get reclaimed properly when
there are a lot of inodes referencing it?  Wilcox said that made for a good
opportunity to talk about some plans he has for splitting
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> and <tt>struct&nbsp;folio</tt> apart, since
currently they are aliases.  He covered some of that in his <a
href="/Articles/893512/">LSFMM session</a> on the previous day.
</p>

<p>
Right now, you can simply cast a folio pointer to a page pointer and vice
versa; "it's a bad code smell, but it works".  The <tt>page</tt> structure has a
pointer in disguise called "<tt>memdesc</tt>" that points to a <tt>folio</tt>
structure.  But there will need to be a way to get the page frame number
(PFN) of the memory referred to by the folio once this 3-5 year "gargantuan
project" of switching over to folios has finished.
</p>

<p>
So there will need to be a way to go from a <tt>folio</tt> structure to the memory
it is describing.  Once that is working, there could be multiple folios
allocated for the same PFN, but with a different mapping and index.  That
could lead to a solution to the problem of tracking the inodes associated
with the cache entries;
there could be multiple folios in different address spaces that all refer
to the same memory.  It is only a long-term solution, he said, because all
of the filesystems will need to be changed to use folios before it can happen.
</p>

<p>
Bacik said that he liked the idea of having a folio per inode that was
sharing extents.  But he wondered if that solution would be unpopular with
the MM developers because pages with lots of references will seem like
unattractive targets for reclaim, but these pages are simply in a cache
that can be reclaimed.
Kent Overstreet said that there needs to be a way to get a clear
understanding of what a given chunk of memory is.  The <tt>page</tt> structure cannot
point to multiple folios, but it could point to a special kind of shared
folio type that lists all of the folios that refer to the page.  That
shared folio could be put onto the least-recently-used (LRU) lists.  Wilcox
said that made sense to him.
</p>

<p>
It is in some ways like kernel same-page merging (KSM), Johannes Weiner
said; a <tt>page</tt> structure is what appears on the LRU and the MM code consults
the container of that page to reclaim all of the mappings to it.  But if
every filesystem has to deal with walking the list of folios 
when reclaim needs to be done, that will make it harder to implement.
Wilcox said that he originally thought it made sense for the filesystems to
keep track of that information, but he was coming around to the idea that
it should be done in the
MM subsystem.  Bacik said he would be happy as long as Wilcox did all the work to
make it happen, which elicited laughter; Wilcox seemed to agree, however.
</p>

<p>
Weiner said that KSM could use that facility as well, which Wilcox said
"would be fantastic".  KSM would just become another example of "something
that is shared between multiple files".  There was general agreement in the
room on that approach.  "OK, we solved it, thanks everyone for coming",
Wilcox said with a laugh; there is, of course, a lot of work to be done to
get there.

I think I went a little fast there ;-)<br>
<p>
Today, struct folio and struct page share the same memory. In The Glorious Future, struct folio will come from kmalloc() and struct page will be reduced to a single pointer with a type encoded in the bottom few bits (folio, slab, page table, etc, etc). That&#x27;s what I was calling the memdesc.<br>

That is the (further) plan, yes. It gets complicated because we then have to completely remove struct page. At the struct-page-is-one-pointer stage, you have a meaningful 1:1 correspondence between struct page and a PFN and a PTE. For example, the page fault handler returns a struct page pointer. We&#x27;ll have to figure out whether to return a PFN or something else to indicate how to fill in the PTE.<br>
<p>
Another example is bio_vec. That uses struct page to describe the memory we want to do I/O to. I have a proposal for that (phyr) but the work needs to be done.<br>
<p>
This project is on a scale comparable to removing the Big Kernel Lock. There are a lot of device drivers to touch to accomplish this.<br>

One thing is not clear after reading the article.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  A buffered read would check the page cache for the file and, if the page is not found there, it would calculate the device offset from the read offset in the file and look in the shared-extent cache to see if the page lives there. If not, it would read the data from the disk and add it to the shared-extent cache.</font><br>
<p>
So if I am to understand this literally, every buffered read that is not fulfilled from the page cache will end up in the shared-extent cache. At no point the article talks about reads populating the page cache.<br>
<p>
Does this mean that on a long-running system, page cache will only be used for writeback and writethrough caching, and for all other purposes page cache is going to be effectively replaced with the new shared-extent cache?<br>

That&#x27;s not the intended model. For a shared extent, it would populate the shared cache. For a unique extent, it would populate the inode&#x27;s page cache.<br>
<p>
In any case, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going that route.<br>

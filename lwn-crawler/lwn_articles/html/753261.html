Memory hotplugging is one of the least-loved areas of the memory-management
subsystem; there are many use cases for it, but nobody has taken ownership
of it.  A similar situation exists for hardware page
poisoning, a somewhat neglected mechanism for dealing with memory errors.
At the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management summit, Michal
Hocko and Mike Kravetz dedicated a pair of brief memory-management track
sessions to problems that have been encountered in these subsystems, one of
which seems more likely to get the attention it needs than the other.
<p>
<h4>Memory hotplugging</h4>
<p>
When memory is added to the system, the kernel must allocate a new array of
<tt>page</tt> structures to keep track of that memory.  That array is
currently allocated with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, Hocko said, which is not the
best thing to do.  Among other things, if the kernel is running on a NUMA
system, the new memory and its <tt>page</tt> structures are likely to end
up on different nodes, which will not be good for performance.  This is
something that is happening now in real workloads.
<p>
One common use case is virtualization environments, where administrators
are using hotplugging to move memory between virtual machines.  The
memory-management developers recommend against doing that — removing memory from
machines is tricky, since there can never be a guarantee that everything
can be moved out of that space — but people do it anyway.  Sometimes they
add quite a bit of memory, consuming a lot of local memory just for
the <tt>page</tt> structures.  If the receiving virtual machine is already
under memory stress, finding a contiguous range of memory for those
structures could be difficult.
<p>
The better solution, Hocko said, would be to just allocate the new
<tt>page</tt> structures from the memory that has just been added.  That
memory is free, unfragmented, and obviously local.  There were once
concerns about "self-hosted" <tt>page</tt> structures when nonvolatile
memory is involved, since those
structures are written to frequently, but those concerns have faded over
time.  Hocko asked whether there were any concerns about implementing this
approach.
<p>
Jérôme Glisse said that there would need to be an opt-out mechanism.  If
the new memory is based on a GPU, for example, the CPU cannot access it and
thus cannot maintain <tt>page</tt> structures there.  The solution seems to
be to just avoid self-hosting <tt>page</tt> structures on device memory.  Vlastimil
Babka asked what would happen if only a portion of the new memory was later
unplugged — and it was the portion containing the <tt>page</tt> structures;
Hocko said he needs to work on that problem still.  Otherwise, though,
there were no complaints beyond the fact that this mechanism "takes some beer
to understand".
<p>
Hocko's other question had to do with the size of the "sections" used to
manage hotplug memory.  A section contains 128MB by default on systems with
a 4KB page size; it is the smallest unit of memory that can be plugged in
or out.  But, it seems, the "virtualization people" would like to do
hotplugging with smaller units of memory.
<p>
That could be supported, he said, but it would waste some memory and be
relatively tricky to implement, so he isn't sure that it is worth the
effort.  Dave Hansen said that there should be no problem with telling
people that hotplugging smaller pieces of memory will be wasteful.  The
approach that seemed to win favor is to behave as if an entire section of
memory had been plugged in, but mark the missing pages as being reserved
and unavailable.

<p>

<h4>Huge-page poisoning</h4>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/348886/">Hardware poisoning</a> is a mechanism designed
to keep a system in a functional state even if some of its memory goes
bad.  It responds to memory errors by locating and isolating the faulty
page — essentially unplugging it from the system, though the hotplug
mechanism is not used.  Mike Kravetz has discovered that page poisoning
doesn't work as well as one might like with huge pages, though.
<p>
The kernel will respond to an error in a huge page in the usual way: it
will try to substitute a working page and take the malfunctioning one
offline.  This works fine for PMD-sized pages, he said.  PMD stands for the
increasingly misnamed "page middle directory", the second-to-last layer in
the system's page-table hierarchy.  PMD-sized pages are the smallest huge
pages, 2MB on x86 systems.  If the system is using PUD-size pages (PUD
being "page upper directory", since there are only two layers above it on
modern systems — 1GB on x86), though, poisoning no longer works.  The
page-table walker simply doesn't take poisoning into account above the PMD
level.  So he decided to disable poisoning for huge pages above the PMD
size.
<p>
Hocko answered that the whole hardware poisoning mechanism seems to be
"test driven" without a whole lot of high-level design.  He has seen some
"nasty changes" to keep the tests happy, such as huge pages being marked
migratable so that offlining can work.  Technically migrating those pages
can be done, but it doesn't actually work.  Allocating new storage for a
huge page in the face of an error tends to be hard.
<p>
Overall, Hocko didn't seem to think much of the feature, but Hansen said
that hardware poisoning is only going to grow in importance; as memory
sizes increase, hardware problems will happen more frequently.  He sees
about two errors per month on a 2TB machine he works with.  Anshuman
Khandoul said that migration is the only way to handle hardware errors in
huge pages, but Kravetz wondered how the system could realistically migrate
a 16GB gigantic page.  Hocko wondered whether hardware poisoning was useful
at all; Hansen replied that it had indeed been added as a "checkbox
feature", but that it was hard to tell for sure because customers never
call to say that their system successfully recovered from an error.
<p>
Hocko remained unimpressed, calling poisoning a "toy" that doesn't work and
is easy to break.  He would like to see somebody explain the design of the
whole thing; that might at least help keep developers from introducing bugs
like the one that motivated this session.  Either that, he said, or bite
the bullet and admit that it was a toy feature all along.  Hansen said that
it is reasonable to ask how important the feature is, but that the arrival
of nonvolatile memory may change the calculation, since that memory is
likely to generate more errors.
<p>
As time ran out, Kravetz said that trying to migrate pages might not be
worth it; perhaps the system should just note errors and mark the pages
bad.  Glisse added that it would then be up to the application to cope with
memory errors.  Kravetz concluded that he is in favor of somebody trying to
understand the design, but that he wasn't seeing any hands raised in the
room; Hocko said that the recovery mechanism is in danger of being ripped
out of the kernel unless a maintainer shows up.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

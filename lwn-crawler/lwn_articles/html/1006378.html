<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 3, 2025</br>
           </div>
By the time that Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/1007546/">released
6.14-rc1</a> and closed the merge window for this development cycle, some
9,307 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline
repository — the lowest level of merge-window activity seen in years.
There were, nonetheless, a number of interesting changes in the
5,000 commits pulled since <a href="/Articles/1005651/">the
first-half merge-window summary</a> was written.
<p>
First, though, to get an idea of how atypical this cycle is, here are the
merge-window commit counts for recent development cycles:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th>Release</th><th>Commits</th></tr>
<tr><td>6.13</td><td class="align_right">12,142</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.12</td><td class="align_right">12,115</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.11</td><td class="align_right">12,954</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.10</td><td class="align_right">12,402</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.9</td><td class="align_right">13,342</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.8</td><td class="align_right">13,052</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, the norm for a long time is to have at least 30% more
commits show up during the merge window than we saw this time.  To find a
slower merge window than this one, it is necessary to go back to 
the 3.6 release in 2012 (with 9,140 commits
during the merge window) — though, the 4.0
release in 2015, with 9,591 merge-window commits, was close.  The
slowdown this time, which was broadly felt across kernel subsystems, may
well be a result of the timing of the development cycle relative to the
holiday season this year and not indicative of a longer-term trend; time
will tell.
<p>
It is also worth keeping some perspective in mind; as Torvalds said in the
announcement: "<q>Of course, 'tiny' for us still means that there's half a
million lines changed, and more than 10k commits in there</q>".
<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
The most interesting changes pulled in the latter part of the 6.14 merge
window include:
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The OpenRISC architecture has gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/697979/">restartable sequences</a>.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There are two new BPF kfuncs — <tt>bpf_local_irq_save()</tt> and
     <tt>bpf_local_irq_restore()</tt> — that will disable interrupts on the
     local CPU and restore them again.  They are intended to help with the
     implementation of interrupt-safe data structures in BPF programs.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4fec4c22f046">This commit</a>
     includes a self-test program that demonstrates their use.
<li> The <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt> and <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> operations in
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
     will now free the associated page tables (when possible) along with
     the indicated address range.  For some workloads, empty page tables
     can waste a lot of memory; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6375e95f381e">this commit</a> for a
     description of the problem that was solved.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/961884/">ntsync subsystem</a>, which provides
     a set of Windows NT synchronization primitives, was merged in 6.10 but
     marked "broken".  All of the broken pieces are now fixed, and this
     subsystem is now fully enabled.  The interface implemented by ntsync
     is documented in <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/ntsync.html">Documentation/userspace-api/ntsync.rst</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The XFS realtime device is a special mode intended to provide
     consistent and predictable latency for filesystem operations.  In 6.14
     the realtime device has gained support for reverse mapping (mapping a
     device block to the file the contains it) and reflink (sharing blocks
     between files) operations.
<li> The fsnotify subsystem has a new event type called
     <tt>FS_PRE_ACCESS</tt>.  If a listener has requested this access, it
     will be notified before content in a file is read, and that access
     will be held up until the listener responds.  The intended purpose, it
     seems, is to help with the implementation of hierarchical storage
     systems, enabling the listener to fill in data from slow storage if
     need be.  This operation requires the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>
     capability; as <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8883957b3c9d">the
     merge message</a> notes: "<q>it is an administrator responsibility to
     make sure the userspace event handler doesn't do stupid stuff that can
     DoS the system</q>".
<li> The <a href="/Articles/998783/">uncached buffered I/O patches</a> have
     been merged.  This block I/O option is meant to provide most of the
     performance benefits of direct I/O using the normal POSIX I/O API and
     without some of the pitfalls of direct I/O.
<li> The NFS server now supports <a
     href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-nfsv4-delstid-08.html">NFS4.2+
     attribute delegation</a>, matching the client support merged for 6.11.
     From <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f34b580514c9">the merge
     message</a>: "<q>An attribute delegation permits an NFS client to
     manage a file's mtime, rather than flushing dirty data to the NFS
     server so that the file's mtime reflects the last write, which is
     considerably slower.</q>"
<li> The NFS <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/filesystems/nfs/localio.html">"localio"
     functionality</a> has been enhanced so that clients can perform direct
     I/O in cases where the client and server are on the same host.
<li> Work has <a href="/Articles/932079/">been underway for some time</a>
     to allow the filesystems in user space (FUSE) subsystem to use
     io_uring.  That capability has landed for 6.14.  There is some
     beginning documentation in <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/filesystems/fuse-io-uring.html">Documentation/filesystems/fuse-io-uring.rst</a>.
	
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     Qualcomm 8917 pin controllers and
     Mediatek MT7988 pin controllers.
<li> <b>Industrial I/O</b>:
     Texas Instruments OPT4060 RGBW color sensors and
     ROHM Semiconductor BD79703 digital-to-analog converters.
<li> <b>Input</b>:
     Intel touch host controllers.
<li> <b>Media</b>:
     ST Microelectronics STM32 camera serial interface controllers.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Microchip inter-processor communication interfaces,
     Samsung Exynos mailboxes,
     Nuvoton MA35 SoC NAND controllers,
     ST Microelectronics STC3117 fuel gauges,
     Thunderbolt 3 interfaces in alternate mode,
     Qualcomm SM8750 interconnects, and
     AMD AE4DMA controllers.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     TI TAS2781 SPI HD-audio side codecs and
     Awinic Technology aw88083 amplifiers.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>perf</tt> tool has, as usual, received a number of enhancements;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7685b334d1e4">this merge
     message</a> for the list.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Once upon a time, there was a patch series implementing the <a
     href="/Articles/820000/"><tt>O_MAYEXEC</tt> option to
     <tt>open()</tt></a>, which would cause the open to succeed only if
     system policy (permission bits, security modules, etc.) would allow
     the target file to be executed.  Its purpose was to enable language
     interpreters (for Python, for example) to decide whether executing a
     given file of text is consistent with local security policies.  This
     idea was later <a href="/Articles/832959/">reimplemented as the
     <tt>trusted_for()</tt> system call</a>, but that one was <a
     href="/Articles/890957/">rejected</a> during the 5.18 merge window.
     <p> In 2024, the idea <a href="/Articles/982085/">returned</a> in a
     form that has now (after yet more changes) been merged for 6.14.
     There is a new option (<tt>AT_EXECVE_CHECK</tt>) to <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html"><tt>execveat()</tt></a>
     that causes the call to check whether the indicated file would be
     allowed to execute (without actually executing it).  There are two new
     securebits (accessible via <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/PR_GET_SECUREBITS.2const.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>)
     that tell interpreters how they should handle input.  The bit now
     named <tt>EXEC_RESTRICT_FILE</tt> instructs interpreters to use
     <tt>AT_EXECVE_CHECK</tt> on a file to decide whether to execute its
     contents, while <tt>EXEC_DENY_INTERACTIVE</tt> tells the interpreter
     to refuse to read interactive commands.  Interpreters must be updated
     separately to implement that functionality.  <p> See <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/check_exec.html">Documentation/userspace-api/check_exec.rst</a>
     for some more information.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There has been a significant reorganization of the code for the
     CRC32 and CRC-T10DIF algorithms; they can now be invoked directly from
     the library interfaces and no longer need involve the kernel's crypto
     layer.  The result is simpler and more efficient code.
<li> Kernel modules will be signed using the SHA512 algorithm rather than
     SHA1 by default.
<li> The kernel is now able to <a href="/Articles/1000654/">allocate and
     free "frozen" pages</a> that have no meaningful reference count.  This
     change will make the slab allocator a bit more efficient, but it also
     helps in the longer-term goal of shrinking the <tt>page</tt>
     structure. 
<li> The new <a href="/Articles/1002362/"><tt>zpdesc</tt> memory
     descriptor</a> also serves that latter goal by acting as a replacement
     for <tt>struct page</tt> for zswap pages.
<li> More Rust bindings have been merged for dealing with PCI buses,
     platform drivers, <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a>,
     and more.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2ab002c755bf">According to Greg
     Kroah-Hartman</a>: "<q>We are almost at the 'write a real driver in
     rust' stage now, depending on what you want to do</q>".  Included in
     the merge are <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/685376d18e9a">a
     sample PCI driver</a> and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b2e8a83242c0">a platform driver</a>
     in Rust.
<li> There is <a href="/Articles/986892/">a new implementation</a> of
     the build-time code that generates symbol versions for loadable
     modules.  It uses information from the DWARF debugging records rather
     than parsing the source directly; the main driver for this work is to
     enable symbol versioning for modules written in Rust.  For the time
     being, at least, both the old and new implementations remain in the
     kernel, with a configuration option to choose between them.

</ul>
<p>
The 6.14 release is most likely to happen on March&nbsp;23, though the
possibility of a one-week delay is always there.  As this release
stabilizes, eyes will be on linux-next to see whether 6.15 reverts to the
mean with regard to commit activity.

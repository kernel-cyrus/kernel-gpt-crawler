           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 17, 2020</br>
           </div>
The idea of an ID-shifting virtual filesystem that would remap user and
group IDs before passing requests through to an underlying real filesystem
has been around 
for a few years but has never made it into the mainline.  Implementations
have taken the form of <a href="/Articles/718639/">shiftfs</a> and <a
href="/Articles/809125/">shifting bind mounts</a>.  Now there is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200211165753.356508-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">yet
another approach to the problem</a> under consideration; this one involves
a theoretically simpler approach that makes
almost no changes to the kernel's filesystem layer at all.
<p>
ID-shifting filesystems are meant to be used with <a
href="/Articles/532593/">user namespaces</a>, which have a number of
interesting characteristics; one of those is that there is a mapping
between user IDs within the namespace and those outside of it.  Normally
this mapping is set up so that processes can run as root within the
namespace without giving them root access on the system as a whole.  A user
namespace could be configured so that ID zero inside maps to ID 10000
outside, for example; ranges of IDs can be set up in this way, so that ID
20 inside 
would be 10020 outside.  User namespaces thus perform a type of ID shifting
now.
<p>
In systems where user namespaces are in use, it is common to set them up to
use non-overlapping ranges of IDs as a way of providing isolation between
containers.  But often complete isolation is not desired.  James Bottomley's
motivation for creating shiftfs was to allow processes within a user
namespace to have root access to a specific filesystem.  With the current
patch set, instead, author Christian Brauner describes a use case where
multiple containers have access to a shared filesystem and need to be able
to access that filesystem with the same user and group IDs.  Either way,
the point is to be able to set up a mapping for user and group IDs that
differs from the mapping established in the namespace itself.
<p>
Shiftfs was a virtual filesystem that would pass operations through to an
underlying filesystem while remapping (by applying a constant offset) the
user and group IDs involved.  The 
later bind-mount implementation did away with the separate filesystem and
made the shifting a property of the mount 
itself.  Brauner's approach, apparently sketched out at the 2019 Linux
Plumbers Conference, is different; it makes the shifting a property of the
user namespace itself.
<p>
Processes in Linux, as in any Unix-like system, have associated user and
group IDs.  It is tempting to think that these IDs control access to files,
but that is not quite true; instead, Linux maintains a separate user and group
ID for filesystem access.  These IDs can be changed (by an appropriately
privileged process) using the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsuid.2.html"><tt>setfsuid()</tt></a>
and <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsgid.2.html"><tt>setfsgid()</tt></a>
system calls.  This feature is rarely used, so the filesystem
user and group IDs are normally the same as the regular IDs, but the
mechanism to separate the two sets of IDs has been there since nearly the
beginning.
<p>
The implementation of user namespaces necessarily understands these filesystem
IDs (FSIDs), but that understanding has never been exposed outside the
kernel.  Brauner's patch set works by making the FSIDs visible and
explicit, allowing them to be mapped independently of the normal IDs.  In
particular, it creates two new files (<tt>fsuid_map</tt> and
<tt>fsgid_map</tt>) under the <tt>/proc</tt> directory for each process
running inside a user namespace.  These behave like the existing
<tt>uid_map</tt> and <tt>gid_map</tt> files, in that they accept one or
more ranges of IDs to remap, but they affect the FSIDs instead.
<p>
So, for example, a system administrator can, on current systems, map 100
user IDs starting at zero inside the container to the range 10,000-10,100
outside by writing this line to <tt>uid_map</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    0 10000 100
</pre>
<p>
By default, this mapping will also affect that namespace's FSIDs.  But if
the FSIDs should be mapped differently, say to a range starting at 20,000,
then the administrator could write this to <tt>fsuid_map</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    0 20000 100
</pre>
<p>
This mechanism is conceptually simpler than the ideas that came before,
though it still requires a 24-part patch series to implement.  It keeps all
of the ID mapping in the same place and doesn't require special filesystem
or mount types.  So there is definitely something to like here.
<p>
There is, though, a significant limitation in this implementation: the FSID
mappings are global, and affect all of a container's filesystem activity,
regardless of which filesystem is being accessed.  The shiftfs or
bind-mount approaches, instead, can be set up on a per-filesystem basis.
Whether this loss of flexibility matters will depend on the specific use
case in question; it seems likely that some users will want the ability to
configure access to different filesystems differently.  Adding that ability
by way of 
the FSID mechanism may well be a complex task.
<p>
Thus far, though, no potential users have spoken up to request this
capability.  This patch set is young, with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200214183554.1133805-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">second
revision</a> having only just been posted, so it's possible that many users
with an interest in this area have not yet encountered it.  The third time
might be the charm for this sort of ID-shifting capability, but to assume
that to be the case would be premature.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes, this is a good point. Also, what would happen if two different containers need to share the same filesystem from host. Or how would one give a read-only filesystem to a container.<br>

It would be slower but you probably can. However you will still need to implement the container UID perspective somewhere : in the SELinux case, you need to add a whole bunch of hooks in the process and filesystem management parts in the kernel, so it would probably be something quite intrusive too.<br>

This is pretty much in-line with the vfs changes all the other solutions needed to add the missing mappings<br>

I am wondering why is it being called shiftfs equivalent. IIUC, on disk UID is not container UID. That's going to be translated UID. I thought with shiftfs, container created files showed on disk with container UID. Shiftfs also solved the issue of not having to do chmod. This patchset will still require doing a chmod (until and unless images have been pulled from inside the user namespace). Am I missing something.<br>

Since I wasn't present for all the discussions, I'm not entirely sure this is what was discussed.  However, I do think putting the unpacker in a user namespace is how this is supposed to work.  As you say this avoids all the chown dances.  This also starts deprivileging pieces of kubernetes as well which people are finally starting to agree is a good thing.<br>

Seems to me that not exposing the FSID is a big advantage of the other approaches. Keeping them an internal detail of the kernel that userspace need not be concerned with and expecting userspace to deal with (bind) mounts instead -- as it already does -- seems conceptually simpler to me in addition to the already-mentioned flexibility advantages.<br>

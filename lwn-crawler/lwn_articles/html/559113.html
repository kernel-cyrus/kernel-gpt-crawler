           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 17, 2013</br>
           </div>
In the dim and distant past (March 2005), the kernel developers were
having <a href="/Articles/126763/">a wide-ranging discussion</a> about
various perceived problems with the kernel development process, one of
which was the inability to get fixes for stable kernel releases out to
users.  Linus suggested that a separate tree for fixes could be maintained
if a suitable "sucker" could be found to manage it, but, he predicted, said
sucker would "<q>go crazy in a couple of weeks</q>" and quit.  As it
turns out, Linus had not counted on just how stubborn Greg Kroah-Hartman
can be; Greg (along with Chris Wright at the time) stepped forward and
volunteered to maintain this tree, starting with the release of <a
href="/Articles/126324/">2.6.11.1</a>.  Greg has continued
to maintain the stable trees ever since.  Recently, though, he has
expressed some frustrations about how the process is working.
<p>
In particular, the <a href="/Articles/559122/">announcement</a> of the
review stage for the 3.10.1 release included a strongly-worded complaint
about how subsystem maintainers are managing patches for the stable tree.
He called out two behaviors that he would like to see changed:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Some patches are being marked for stable releases that clearly 
     do not belong there.  Cosmetic changes to debug messages were called
     out as an example of this type of problem.
<p>
<li> More importantly: a lot of the patches marked as being for the stable
     tree go into the mainline during the merge window.  In many cases,
     that means that the subsystem maintainer held onto the patches for
     some time — months, perhaps — rather than pushing them to Linus for a
     later -rc release.  If the patches are important enough to go into the
     stable tree, Greg asked, why are they not going to Linus immediately?
</ul>
<p>
Starting with the second complaint above, the explanation appears to be
relatively straightforward: getting Greg to accept changes for the stable
tree is rather easier than getting Linus to accept them outside of the
merge window.  In theory, the rules for inclusion into the stable tree are
the same as for getting patches into the mainline late in the cycle: the
patches in question must fix some sort of "critical" problem.  In practice,
Linus and Greg are at least perceived to interpret the rules differently.
So developers, perhaps unwilling to risk provoking an outburst from Linus,
will simply hold fixes until the next merge window comes around.  As James
Bottomley <a href="/Articles/559137/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You mean we delay fixes to the merge window (tagged for stable)
	because we can't get them into Linus' tree at -rc5 on?  Guilty
	... that's because the friction for getting stuff in rises.  It's a
	big fight to get something marginal in after -rc5 ... it's easy to
	silently tag it for stable.
</div>
<p>
Greg's plan for improving things involves watching linux-next starting
around the -rc4 mainline release.  If patches marked for the stable series
start appearing in linux-next, he'll ask the maintainers why those patches have not
yet found their way to Linus.  Some of those patches may well find
themselves refused entry into the stable tree if they only show up in the
mainline during the merge window.
<p>
The topic of fully inappropriate patches, while the lesser part of Greg's
complaint, became the larger part of the discussion.  There are, it seems,
any number of reasons for patches to be directed at the stable tree even if
they are not stable material.  At one extreme, <a
href="/Articles/559134/">Ben Herrenschmidt's description</a> of how the
need to get code into enterprise kernels drives the development process is
well worth reading.  For most other cases, though, the causes are probably
more straightforward.
<p>
For years, people worried that important fixes were being overlooked and
not getting into the stable updates; that
led to  pressure on developers to mark appropriate
patches for the stable tree.  This campaign has been quite successful, to
the point that 
now, often, developers add a stable tag to a patch that fixes a 
bug as a matter of reflex.  Subsystem maintainers are supposed to review
such tags as part of their review of the patch as a whole, but that review
may not always happen — or those maintainers may 
agree that a patch should go into the stable tree, even if it doesn't
adhere to the rules.  And sometimes subsystem maintainers can't remove the
tag even if they want to.  All this led James to <a
href="/Articles/559135/">propose</a> doing away with the stable tag
altogether:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The real root cause of the problem is that the cc: stable tag can't
	be stripped once it's in the tree, so maintainers only get to
	police things they put in the tree.  Stuff they pull from others is
	already tagged and that tag can't be changed.  This effectively
	pushes the problem out to the lowest (and possibly more
	inexperienced) leaves of the Maintainer tree.
</div>
<p>
James (along with others) proposes that putting a patch into the stable
tree should require an explicit action on the subsystem maintainer's part.
But Greg <a href="/Articles/559136/">dislikes</a> this idea, noting that
maintainers are already far too busy.  The whole point of the stable tree
process is to make things as easy for everybody else as possible; adding
work for maintainers would endanger the success of the whole exercise.
That is especially true, he said, because some developers might encounter
resistance from their employers:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And that annoys the hell out of some Linux companies who feel that
	the stable kernels compete with them.  So people working for those
	companies might not get as much help with doing any additional work
	for stable kernel releases (this is not just idle gossip, I've
	heard it directly from management's mouths.)
</div>
<p>
Another proponent of explicit maintainer involvement is Jiri Kosina, who,
in his work with SUSE's kernels, has <a
href="/Articles/559138/">encountered</a> a few problems with stable
kernels.  While the stable tree is highly valuable to him, some of the
patches in it cause regressions, some are just useless, and, for some,
there is no real indication of why the patches are in the stable tree in
the first place.  Forcing maintainers to explicitly nominate and justify
patches for the stable tree would, he said, address all three types of
problem. 
<p>
The first type — patches that introduce bugs of their own — will probably
never be eliminated 
entirely; that is just how software development works.  Everybody in the
discussion has acknowledged that, once a buggy fix is identified, Greg
quickly makes a stable release with that patch removed, so regressions tend
not to stay around for long.  Useless patches include those that are
backported to kernels that predate the original bug; this problem could be
addressed by placing more information in the changelog describing when the
bug was introduced.  The final type of problem raised by Jiri — mysterious
patches — turned out to be security 
fixes.  Jiri (and others) would like security fixes marked as such in the
changelog, but that <a href="/Articles/559201/">is unlikely to
happen</a>; instead, more effort is being 
made to notify distributors of security fixes via private channels.
<p>
In other words, while changes are likely to be made, they will not be
fundamental in nature.  Greg is likely to become fussier about the 
patches he accepts for the stable tree.  Chances are, though, that he will
never be as hard to please as Linus in this regard.  In the end, the
consumers of the stable tree — distributors and users both — <i>want</i>
fixes to be included there.  The stable kernel series is one of the biggest
successes of the kernel development process; any changes to how they are
created are likely to be relatively small and subtle.  For most of us, the
fixes will continue to flow as usual.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I do wonder why such tags aren't being managed using Git notes, at least in the main workflow. This would at least enable maintainers to add/remove the tags in a more flexible manner.

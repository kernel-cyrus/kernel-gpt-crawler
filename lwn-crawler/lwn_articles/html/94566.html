<h1>Kernel Summit: Asynchronous I/O</h1>

</td></tr></table>


Suparna Bhattacharya has done much of the recent work on asynchronous I/O,
so she was the logical person to lead a session on that subject.  She noted
that numerous patches exist which address many of the current shortcomings
of mainline AIO; these patches include the retry mechanism, support for asynchronous
buffered filesystem I/O, pipe I/O, and the <tt>poll()</tt> system call.
Vector AIO (a mechanism for joining multiple asynchronous requests and
submitting them together) is also in the works.
<p>

Beyond simply completing the implementation, Linux AIO could use a number
of other changes.  One idea calls for separating the current
<tt>aio_read()</tt> <tt>file_operations</tt> method into
<tt>submit_aio_read()</tt> and <tt>complete_aio_read()</tt> (and similarly
for the write side).  Splitting the AIO method in that way would apparently
make retry-based implementations easier to implement.  The kernel currently
supports "synchronous kiocbs," which are a way of requesting synchronous
operations via the AIO paths; it may come as little surprise that nobody is
actually using this mechanism, so it can come out.
<p>

In a more general sense, it is perhaps time to reexamine the relationship
between synchronous and asynchronous I/O.  One could look at synchronous
operations as really just being the asynchronous variety with a wait added
at the end.  If the kernel were restructured along those lines, some things
would be simplified, but it would imply that retry-based schemes (used for
buffered filesystem AIO - see <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/73847/">LWN's coverage</a>) would be used for
synchronous I/O as well.
<p>
The topic turned to asynchronous <tt>fsync()</tt>; Linus noted that,
internally, this call is implemented by starting the requisite I/O, then
waiting for completion.  It would not be hard to export a separate,
asynchronous <tt>fsync()</tt> operation.  Why not, asked Suparna, simply
use the existing AIO interface for that?  The answer, it seems, is that
nobody likes the current AIO interface.  Few people use it; even glibc
avoids it.
<p>
So, one might ask, how can this interface be fixed?  One idea was to add an
<tt>aio_suspend()</tt> system call which could wait for (one or more of)
multiple I/O contexts to complete.  Other ideas included using signals to
notify processes of completion, or simply to use the epoll calls.  One way
of doing that could be to create a new file descriptor for each outstanding
AIO operation which could then be passed to epoll.
<p>
The real problem with AIO, however, remains the (perceived) lack of users
for this capability.  The existing AIO code is used by a few high-end
databases for their file I/O, and MySQL is apparently being extended to
make use of it - but that is about it.  Really pushing AIO forward will
require that more users step up, and that the performance benefits of
working in this mode be better demonstrated.

      We're happily using aio (in a RHEL 3 2.4 based kernel), with some added patches <br>for vector aio, and copyless network transmits. aio is very important to us, and <br>we'd really like to see increased support, especially where it enables copyless <br>operation.

      Sure. It's a clustered filesystem (a hot topic these days). It's  <br>implemented in userspace, so efficient and copyless I/O are essential.  <br>  <br>We're using Red Hat's Enterprise kernel, which provides aio poll and  <br>blockdev read/write. We hacked aio readv and writev (a must for  <br>performance) and copyless aio udp sendmsg. We'll probably do aio tcp  <br>sendmsg as well.  <br>  <br>We would dearly love the receive counterparts as well, especially if they  <br>are copyless, though more sophisticated networking hardware is probably  <br>needed.  <br>  <br>I'd like to emphasize that aio poll is absolutely crucial for mixing <br>networking and blockdev I/O, at least until full aio networking support is <br>available. <br> <br>Avi

      What I'd like to hear is how it's better than buffered I/O and/or multiple threads doing synchronous I/O.  That's what it's competing with.

      Buffered I/O is out of the question. It involves copying which reduces throughput. Synchronous reads, buffered or not, will block, throwing parallelism out the window. We do our own caching (distributed filesystem), so the kernel cache is very small and ineffective; it only adds overhead,<p>Our previous solution was nonblocking network I/O, plus slave threads doing synchronous direct disk I/O. This had two problems:<p>- less efficient due to context switches and scheduling latencies<br>- no way to do copyless network I/O.<p>The last point is only partially addressed by aio, but it's better than nothing.

      We definately need a 'call-to-arms' from the aio users. How about we collect experiences from AIO users? We ( OSDL ) are very interested, and we'd be glad to know of as many applications for AIO as possible, especially people who could give us a sample workload for testing purposes.

      I'd love to use asynchronous file I/O. Unfortunately, the APIs have "this was designed to make Oracle go fast" written all over them. I couldn't think of a single thing they were useful for except a big old-fashioned database. They can't even do open() asynchronously.<br>
<p>
The application I was interested in was GUI file managers. To call up a directory in a file manager, you first need the file list, then you need to stat every file, and then ideally you need to read the file's magic number. At present all this is done synchronously, so the disk goes crazy seeking all over the damn place, and it takes forever. If the I/O requests could be submitted asynchronously, then the kernel could sort them using its normal elevator algorithm, and performance would suck less.<br>
<p>
What it comes down to is that the current AsyncIO API has few users because it has few uses. If there was an AsyncIO API "for the peoples", that made things like web servers and "ls -l" faster, then the users would come.<br>

      We use asynchronous I/O from network, serial and keyboard devices. We do <br>
this in a single thread because we do not believe that multiple thread <br>
responsiveness is as good. This is via SIGIO. <br>
 <br>
We have not used the 'aio' named functions. Not due to lack of interest. I <br>
think a more general description of the functions is needed.  <br>

      i have been testing aio vs synchronous io and i came to conclude that aio is not doing the job. the test was as follows, i have created big buffers for fetching data from the disks ( 4 MB ) and submitted 200 requests . I have done it synchronously and asynchnrously and the async io seems to be 5 times slower, at least. 
Also, and this is just a side remark, linux seems to wasting cpu when it comes to io. no matter whether it is sync io or async io.

Raz.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 14, 2011</br>
           </div>
Video4Linux2 drivers are charged with the task of acquiring video data from
a sensor (via some sort of DMA controller, usually) and transferring those
video frames to user space.  The amount of data being moved makes
performance a consideration; to that end, V4L2 has defined <a
href="/Articles/240667/">a somewhat complex API</a> to handle streaming
data.  Implementing this API adds a certain amount of complexity to V4L2
drivers, but much of that complexity is the same from one driver to the
next.  To make life easier for driver writers (and their users), the
"videobuf" subsystem was created to handle many of the details of streaming
I/O buffer management.  LWN <a href="/Articles/363349/">documented
videobuf</a> toward the end of 2009; a version of that article also found
its way into the kernel's documentation directory.
<p>
This is the Linux kernel we're talking about, though, so 2009 is ancient
history.  The videobuf interface has since been superseded by videobuf2,
which, while clearly inspired by the original, has a different way of doing
things.  So this article will be an attempt to get caught up with the
current state of the art - an effort which will certainly inspire the
creation of videobuf3 in the near future.
<p>
Why videobuf2?  The original videobuf worked well, but it turned out to be
inflexible in a number of ways.  The API varied considerably depending on
which type of buffer was in use, and there was no real way for drivers to
add their own specific memory management needs.  Videobuf2 has created a
more consistent API which allows for more customization in the drivers
themselves.
<p>
<h4>Buffers</h4>
<p>
Like the original videobuf, videobuf2 implements three basic types of
buffers.  <b>Vmalloc</b> buffers are allocated with <tt>vmalloc()</tt>, and
are thus virtually contiguous in kernel space; drivers working with these
buffers almost invariably end up copying the data once as it passes through
the system.  <b>Contiguous DMA</b> buffers are physically contiguous in
memory, usually because the hardware cannot perform DMA to any other type
of buffer.  <b>S/G DMA</b> buffers are scattered through memory; they are
the way to go if the hardware can do scatter/gather DMA.
<p>
Depending on the type of buffer being used, the driver will need to include
one of the following header files:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;media/videobuf2-vmalloc.h&gt;
    #include &lt;media/videobuf2-dma-contig.h&gt;
    #include &lt;media/videobuf2-dma-sg.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
One nice difference with videobuf2 is that a driver can be written to
support more than one mode if need be.  The above include files do not
conflict with each other, and the videobuf2 interface is nearly the same
for all three modes.

<p>
A buffer for a video frame is represented by <tt>struct vb2_buffer</tt>, defined in
<tt>&lt;media/videobuf2-core.h&gt;</tt>.  Usually drivers will want to
track per-buffer information of their own, so, in the usual style, the
driver will define its own buffer type that includes a <tt>vb2_buffer</tt>
instance.  However, the videobuf2 authors didn't read Neil Brown's <a
href="/Articles/446317/">Object-oriented design patterns in the kernel</a>,
so they don't have the driver allocate the resulting structures (in all
fairness, said developers may offer lame
excuses to the effect that said article had not been written at the time).  That
means that (1)&nbsp;the driver has to tell videobuf2 what the real size of
the structure is, and (2)&nbsp;the <tt>vb2_buffer</tt> instance must be the
first field in the driver's structure.  Your editor may just post a patch
to fix that in the near future.
<p>
A videobuf2 driver must create a set of callbacks to give to the videobuf2
subsystem, five of which are specific to the management of buffers; they
function in a similar (but not identical) manner to the videobuf versions.
These callbacks are:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*buf_init)(struct vb2_buffer *vb);
    int (*buf_prepare)(struct vb2_buffer *vb);
    void (*buf_queue)(struct vb2_buffer *vb);
    int (*buf_finish)(struct vb2_buffer *vb);
    void (*buf_cleanup)(struct vb2_buffer *vb);
</pre>
<p>
Videobuf2 will call <tt>buf_init()</tt> for each new buffer after it has
been allocated; the driver can then perform any additional initialization
that needs to be done.  Returning a failure code will abort the setup of
the buffer queue.
<p>
The <tt>buf_prepare()</tt> callback is invoked when user space queues the
buffer (i.e. in response to a <tt>VIDIOC_QBUF</tt> operation); it should do
any preparation which might be required before the buffer is used for I/O.
<tt>buf_queue()</tt>, instead, is called to pass actual ownership of the
buffer to the driver, indicating that it's time to actually start I/O on
it.
<p>
<tt>buf_finish()</tt> will be called just before the buffer is passed back
to user space.  One might question the need for this callback; the driver
already knows when a buffer has a new frame for user
space and, indeed, must tell videobuf2 about it.  One possible answer is
that the completion of I/O to the buffer is often handled in interrupt
context, while <tt>buf_finish()</tt> will be called in process context.
<p>
Finally, <tt>buf_cleanup()</tt> is called just before a buffer is freed so
that the driver can do any additional cleanup work required.

<p>
<h4>Other videobuf2 callbacks</h4>
<p>
In the original videobuf, the only callbacks provided by the driver had to
do with buffer management.  With videobuf2, there are a few others,
starting with:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*queue_setup)(struct vb2_queue *q, unsigned int *num_buffers,
		       unsigned int *num_planes, unsigned long sizes[],
		       void *alloc_ctxs[]);
</pre>
<p>
This function, called in response to a <tt>VIDIOC_REQBUFS</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt> operation,
allows the driver to influence how the buffer queue is set up.  The
<tt>vb2_queue</tt> structure describes the queue as a whole; we'll see more
about it shortly.  The <tt>num_buffers</tt> argument is the number of
buffers requested by the application; the driver can modify it if needed.
<tt>num_planes</tt> contains the number of distinct video planes needed to
hold a frame; for packed formats, it will be one, but it will be larger if
planar formats are in use (see <a href="/Articles/218798/">this article</a>
for more information on formats).  The <tt>sizes</tt> array should contain
the size (in bytes) of each plane.
<p>
The <tt>alloc_ctxs</tt> field contains the "allocation context" for each
plane; it is currently only used by the contiguous DMA mode.  Drivers which
use contiguous DMA should call:
<p>
<pre>
    void *vb2_dma_contig_init_ctx(struct device *dev)
</pre>
<p>
to get that context; it needs to be remembered and passed to
<tt>vb2_dma_contig_cleanup_ctx()</tt> when the driver shuts down.
<p>
There are two callbacks which tell the driver when to start and stop
acquiring video data:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*start_streaming)(struct vb2_queue *q);
    int (*stop_streaming)(struct vb2_queue *q);
</pre>
<p>
Videobuf2 will call <tt>start_streaming()</tt> whenever user space wants to
start grabbing data.  That may happen in response to a
<tt>VIDIOC_STREAMON</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt>, but the videobuf2 implementation
of the <tt>read()</tt> system call can also use it.  A call to
<tt>stop_streaming()</tt> will be made when user space no longer wants
data; this callback should not return until DMA has been stopped.  It's
worth noting that, after the <tt>stop_streaming()</tt> call, videobuf2 will
grab back all buffers passed to the driver; the driver should forget any
references it may have to those buffers.

<p>
<h4>Locking</h4>
<p>
The final two callbacks deserve a section of their own.  The locking model
used for videobuf2 is not documented all that well; from what your editor
has been able to gather, the rules are mostly like the following.  The
driver needs a lock (probably a mutex) which governs access to the device
as a whole.  Then:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Calls that the driver makes directly into videobuf2 should be made
     with the device lock held.
<p>
<li> Callbacks to the driver from videobuf2 should assume that the lock has
     already been taken.  For example, a <tt>start_streaming()</tt> call
     will result from a user-space request to acquire data which will have
     necessarily passed through the driver before videobuf2 gets involved,
     so, by the time <tt>start_streaming()</tt> is called, the device lock
     will be held.
</ul>
<p>
With that context, one needs to consider one little problem: a user-space
invocation of <tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt>, meant to get a buffer full of data
from the kernel, may block waiting for a buffer to become available.  That,
in turn, may not happen until user space (perhaps in a different thread)
hands a buffer back to the kernel with <tt>VIDIOC_QBUF</tt>.  If the first
call blocks with the lock held, the application will end up waiting for a
very long time.  For this situation, videobuf2 provides two more callbacks:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*wait_prepare)(struct vb2_queue *q);
    void (*wait_finish)(struct vb2_queue *q);
</pre>
<p>
Before a <tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt> operation blocks to wait for a buffer, it
will call <tt>wait_prepare()</tt> to release the device lock; once it stops
waiting, a call to <tt>wait_finish()</tt> will reacquire the lock.  It
might have been better to call them <tt>release_lock()</tt> and
<tt>reacquire_lock()</tt>, but so it goes.
<p>
<h4>Queue setup</h4>
<p>
With all of the above in place, the driver can introduce itself to
videobuf2.  The first step is to fill in a <tt>vb2_ops</tt> structure with
all of the callbacks described above:
<p>
<pre>
    static const struct vb2_ops my_special_callbacks = {
		.queue_setup = my_special_queue_setup,
		/* ... */
    };
</pre>
<p>
Then, to set up a videobuf2 queue (normally done either at device
registration or device open time), the driver should allocate a
<tt>vb2_queue</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct vb2_queue {
	enum v4l2_buf_type		type;
	unsigned int			io_modes;
	unsigned int			io_flags;
	const struct vb2_ops		*ops;
	const struct vb2_mem_ops	*mem_ops;
	void				*drv_priv;
	unsigned int			buf_struct_size;
	/* Lots of private stuff omitted */
    };
</pre>
<p>
The structure should be zeroed, and the above fields filled in.
<tt>type</tt> is the buffer type, usually
<tt>V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE</tt>.  <tt>io_modes</tt> is a bitmask
describing what types of buffers can be handled:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>VB2_MMAP</tt>: buffers allocated within the kernel and 
     accessed via <tt>mmap()</tt>; vmalloc and contiguous DMA buffers will
     usually be of this type.
<p>
<li> <tt>VB2_USERPTR</tt>: buffers allocated in user space.  Normally, only
     devices which can do scatter/gather I/O can deal with user-space
     buffers.  Interestingly, videobuf2 supports contiguous buffers
     allocated by user space; the only way to get those, though, is to use
     some sort of special mechanism like the out-of-tree Android "pmem"
     driver.  Contiguous I/O to huge pages is <i>not</i> supported.
<p>
<li> <tt>VB2_READ</tt>,
     <tt>VB2_WRITE</tt>: user-space buffers provided via the
     <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> system calls.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>mem_ops</tt> field is where the driver tells videobuf2 what kind of
buffers it is actually using; it should be set to one of
<tt>vb2_vmalloc_memops</tt>, <tt>vb2_dma_contig_memops</tt>, or
<tt>vb2_dma_sg_memops</tt>.  If a situation arises where none of the
existing modes works for a specific device, the driver author can create a
custom set of <tt>vb2_mem_ops</tt> to meet that need; as of this writing,
there are no drivers in the mainline kernel that have supplied their own
memory operations.
<p>
Finally, <tt>drv_priv</tt> is a place where the driver can stash a pointer
of its own (usually to its device structure), and <tt>buf_struct_size</tt>
is where the driver tells videobuf2 how big its buffer structure is.  Once
the structure has been filled in, it can be passed to:
<p>
<pre>
    int vb2_queue_init(struct vb2_queue *q);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>vb2_queue_release()</tt> should be made when the device is
shut down.
<p>
<h4>Device operations</h4>
<p>
Now most of the infrastructure for videobuf2 is in place; what's left is
(1)&nbsp;making the connection between user space operations and their
implementation in videobuf2, and (2)&nbsp;actually performing I/O.  For the
first step, the driver needs to create V4L2 callbacks for the various
I/O-oriented <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls in the usual way.  Most of these
callbacks, though, can simply acquire the device lock and call directly
into videobuf2.  There is a whole set of functions to be used in this role:
<p>
<pre>
    int vb2_querybuf(struct vb2_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b);
    int vb2_reqbufs(struct vb2_queue *q, struct v4l2_requestbuffers *req);
    int vb2_qbuf(struct vb2_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b);
    int vb2_dqbuf(struct vb2_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b, 
		  bool nonblocking);
    int vb2_streamon(struct vb2_queue *q, enum v4l2_buf_type type);
    int vb2_streamoff(struct vb2_queue *q, enum v4l2_buf_type type);
</pre>
<p>
A similar thing needs to be done with a number of entries in the driver's
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure.  To that end, videobuf2 provides:
<p>
<pre>
    int vb2_mmap(struct vb2_queue *q, struct vm_area_struct *vma);
    unsigned int vb2_poll(struct vb2_queue *q, struct file *file, 
			  poll_table *wait);
    size_t vb2_read(struct vb2_queue *q, char __user *data, size_t count,
		    loff_t *ppos, int nonblock);
    size_t vb2_write(struct vb2_queue *q, char __user *data, size_t count,
		     loff_t *ppos, int nonblock);
</pre>
<p>
This, of course, is where the payoff happens: all the grungy details of
buffer management, implementing <tt>mmap()</tt>, and more are handled in
videobuf2 with no further mess.  So the driver code is significantly
shorter, the core code is known to be well debugged, and devices behave
more consistently toward user space.
<p>
There's only one little bit of work left to do: actually getting the data
into the buffers.  For vmalloc buffers, that task is usually accomplished
with something like <tt>memcpy()</tt>; one useful helper function in this
case is:
<p>
<pre>
    void *vb2_plane_vaddr(struct vb2_buffer *vb, unsigned int plane_no);
</pre>
<p>
which returns the kernel-space virtual address for the given <tt>plane</tt>
in the buffer.
<p>
Contiguous DMA drivers will need to get the bus address to hand to the
device for I/O; that address can be had with:
<p>
<pre>
    dma_addr_t vb2_dma_contig_plane_paddr(struct vb2_buffer *vb, 
                                          unsigned int plane_no);
</pre>
<p>
For scatter/gather drivers, the interface is just a bit more complex:
<p>
<pre>
    struct vb2_dma_sg_desc {
	unsigned long		size;
	unsigned int		num_pages;
	struct scatterlist	*sglist;
    };

    struct vb2_dma_sg_desc *vb2_dma_sg_plane_desc(struct vb2_buffer *vb, 
						  unsigned int plane_no);
</pre>
<p>

In this case, the driver can obtain the scatterlist from videobuf2 which
can then be used to program the device for I/O.
<p>
For all three cases, the buffer will eventually be filled with frame data
which needs to be passed back to user space.  The <tt>vb2_buffer</tt>
structure contains <tt>v4l2_buffer</tt> structure (called
<tt>v4l2_buf</tt>) which should be filled in with the usual information:
image size, sequence number, time stamp, etc.  Then the buffer should be
passed to:
<p>
<pre>
    void vb2_buffer_done(struct vb2_buffer *vb, enum vb2_buffer_state state);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>state</tt> parameter should be passed as
<tt>VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE</tt> for a normal completion, or
<tt>VB2_BUF_STATE_ERROR</tt> if something went wrong.  Happily videobuf2,
unlike its predecessor, does not get upset if buffers are completed in an
arbitrary order.

<p>
And that is a fairly complete summary of the state of the art with regard
to the videobuf2 API.  Those wanting to see the complete interface can find
it in the include files mentioned above.  As always, the "virtual video"
driver (in <tt>drivers/media/video/vivi.c</tt>) serves as a sort of
showcase for almost everything Video4Linux2 can do; it uses videobuf with
vmalloc-style buffers.  As of this writing, there is no videobuf3 in sight,
so hopefully the information found here will remain useful for a while.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Well, locking is explained in Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-framework, section "v4l2_file_operations and locking". But it doesn't mention videobuf2 (must be fixed) and should probably be expanded/improved a bit.<br>
<p>
But in a nutshell: you either set the 'lock' field in struct video_device to a mutex and then the framework will take care of serialization of file operations (mostly ioctls) for you, or you leave it at NULL and you have to do your own locking.<br>
<p>
I tend to advocate using the framework serialization rather than doing it yourself since the chances of actually getting the locking right in a complex driver if you do it yourself are pretty close to zero, especially after the driver has undergone a few years of maintenance.<br>

      As you know, some of us are not entirely in agreement there.  I don't think you can do a complex driver without being aware of locking; trying to hide it looks to me like an attempt to return to the good old days of uniprocessor systems.  I don't know of any other kernel subsystem which tries to hide locking in the midlayers in this way - though there almost certainly is one somewhere.

I know. We don't hide it, BTW, you have to explicitly set it up. The simple fact is that the vast majority of V4L2 drivers need to serialize ioctl calls anyway. This is usually implemented pretty badly.<br>
<p>
Another reason for doing this was the BKL removal were we needed something reasonably simple to convert old (usually unmaintained) drivers without having to do extensive code reviews.<br>

      Understood, that all makes sense, sorry if I sounded critical.  You've put in a lot of work and, as a result, V4L2 has gotten a <i>lot</i> better in the time I've been paying attention to it.

It is not true that the authors of videobuf2 have no knowledge about object-oriented pattern in the kernel. Earlier versions of videobuf2 patches had support for buf_allocate and buf_free driver's method (see for example: <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg25386.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg25386.html</a> and <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg25389.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg25389.html</a>). They have been removed later in favour of buffer_size entry in struct vb2_queue, because they were considered superfluous by other v4l2 developers (some discussion can be found here: <a href="http://linuxtv.org/irc/v4l/index.php?date=2010-11-25">http://linuxtv.org/irc/v4l/index.php?date=2010-11-25</a> ).<br>

      Please note that the article did not say "the authors of videobuf2 have no knowledge about object-oriented pattern in the kernel."  I did make a sort of lame joke about not having read an article we had published a whole week before; apologies if that didn't come through.

I had a bit of a look at this code ... it is always nice to have a little motivation to look at something new to see what I can learn.<br>
<p>
I think the code we are talking about is in drivers/media/video/videobuf2-core.c, starting at vb2_reqbufs().<br>
<p>
The low level driver is expected to call this function to "Initiate Streaming".<br>
<p>
This function calls back into the driver via 'queue_setup' to negotiate the number of buffers (and related details) - possibly twice if the original request could not be met.  It also calls back into the driver using the buf_init callback (this is inside sub-function __vb2_queue_alloc) for device-specific initialisation of each allocated buffer.<br>
<p>
The driver gets to control the size allocate for the 'vb2_buffer' by setting a 'buf_struct_size' field in the vb2_queue.  You could almost look at this like a constant callback.  The library code does ask the driver to do something for it, but as that something is just "give me a number" not "perform an operation", it is a number rather than a function.<br>
<p>
The underlying pattern here is that of a complex library function that uses call-backs to handle some caller-specific details.  This is a pattern that I find should be used with caution.<br>
<p>
In simple cases it is a perfectly good pattern.  A simple example is qsort which needs a callback to compare (and maybe another to swap) two entries in the array being sorted.<br>
<p>
The 'page cache' library in Linux follows this pattern too with all the callbacks into the filesystem being collected in 'address_space_operation', and I think that is mostly OK, though bits of it seem a little complex ... I should probably give it more thought.<br>
<p>
While I haven't done a proper study of this pattern, my feeling is that a sign of problems is when the library needs to call back to ask questions, rather than just to perform actions.  This is a problem because it is hard to know if you have really asked all the questions that could be asked.  i.e. Maybe the driver writer wants to do something a little bit beyond what the library writer foresaw.  If you find that the library is in control rather than the driver being in control, then it is possible that the design is suffering from what I have called "The midlayer mistake", or something very like it.  So thae aspect of this interface that concerns me is really queue_setup rather than the buffer allocation details.<br>
<p>
The alternative is to provide a collection of fine-grained functionality in the library that the driver can use to create the desired result, and leave the driver to handle the control logic (though with suitable documentation and templates to help avoid common mistakes).<br>
<p>
Were this approach applied to vb2_reqbufs (and I'm not saying that it should be, just exploring possibilities), then the driver would code the main loop that allocates N buffers for whatever N it finds to be appropriate, and would handle errors directly, thus making queue_setup redundant.  The driver would initialise the buffers that it allocated (so buf_struct_size and buf_init would not be needed), but it would call in to the library to initialise the part of the structures that the library owns, and possibly to do some other common validity checking.<br>
<p>
The important distinction between this approach and the currently implemented approach is about where control is - in the library or in the driver.  The cost of putting control in the driver is that it is duplicated and more error prone.  The cost of putting control in the library is that if a driver writer finds that they need something a little bit different it can be very hard to implement that cleanly.<br>
<p>
Which one is most appropriate for videobuf2 I cannot say.  One would need to implement both in at least a few drivers and compare the complexity to be sure.  And even if you did find that one seemed a little bit cleaner than the other, you would need strong motivation to change working code!<br>

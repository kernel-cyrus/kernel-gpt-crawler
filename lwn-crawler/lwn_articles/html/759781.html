           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 13, 2018</br>
           </div>
All underutilized systems are essentially the same, but each overutilized
system tends to be overloaded in its own way.  If one's goal is to
maximize the use of the available computing resources, overutilization
tends not to be too far away, but when it happens, it can be hard to tell
where the problem is.  Sometimes, even the fact that there is a problem at
all is not immediately apparent.  <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/cgroups/20180712172942.10094-1-hannes@cmpxchg.org/">The
pressure-stall information patch set</a> from Johannes Weiner may make life
easier for system 
administrators by exposing more information about the real utilization
state of the system.
<p>
A kernel with this patch set applied will have a new virtual directory
called <tt>/proc/pressure</tt> containing three files.  The first,
<tt>cpu</tt>, describes the state of CPU utilization in the system.
Reading it will produce a line like this:
<p>
<pre>
    some avg10=2.04 avg60=0.75 avg300=0.40 total=157656722
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>avg</tt> numbers give the percentage of the time that runnable
processes are delayed because the CPU is unavailable to them, accumulated
over ten, 60, and 300 seconds.  In a system with just one runnable process
per CPU, 
the numbers will all be zero.  If those numbers start to increase
significantly, that means that processes are running more slowly than they
otherwise would due to overloading of the CPUs.  Administrators can use
this information to determine whether the amount of delay due to CPU
contention is within the bounds they can tolerate or whether something must
be done to ensure that things run more quickly.
<p>
These delay numbers resemble the system load average, in that they both
give a sense for how busy the system is.  The load average is simply the
<i>number</i> of processes waiting for the CPU (along with those in
short-term I/O waits), though; it needs to be
interpreted relative to the number of available CPUs to have meaning.  The
stall information, instead, tracks the actual amount of waiting time.  It
is also tracked over a much shorter time range than the load average.
<p>
The final number (<tt>total</tt>) is the total amount of time (in
microseconds) during which processes were stalled.  It is there to help
with the detection of short-term latency spikes that wouldn't show up in
the aggregated numbers.  A system where a CPU is nearly always available
but where occasional 10ms latency spikes are experienced may be entirely
acceptable for some workloads, but not for others.  For the latter group,
the <tt>total</tt> count can be monitored to detect when those spikes are
happening. 

<p>
The next file is <tt>/proc/pressure/memory</tt>; as might be expected, it
provides information on the time that processes spend waiting due to memory
pressure.  Its output looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    some avg10=70.24 avg60=68.52 avg300=69.91 total=3559632828
    full avg10=57.59 avg60=58.06 avg300=60.38 total=3300487258
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>some</tt> line is similar to the CPU information: it tracks the
percentage of the time that at least one process could be running if it
weren't waiting for memory resources.  In particular, the time spent for
swapping in, refaulting pages from the page cache, and performing direct
reclaim is tracked in this way.  It is, thus, a good indicator of when the
system is thrashing due to a lack of memory.
<p>
The <tt>full</tt> line is a little different: it tracks the time that
nobody is able to use the CPU for actual work due to memory pressure.  If
all processes are waiting for paging I/O, the CPU may look idle, but that's
not because of a lack of work to do.  If those processes are performing
memory reclaim, the end result is nearly the same; the CPU is busy, but it's
not doing the work that the computer is there to do.  If the <tt>full</tt>
numbers are much above zero, it's clear that the system lacks the memory it
needs to support the current workload.
<p>
Some care has been taken to distinguish paging due to thrashing from other
sorts of paging.  A process that is just starting up will experience a lot
of page faults as its working set is brought in, but those are not really
indicative of system load.  For that reason, <i>refaulted</i> pages — those
which were evicted due to memory pressure and subsequently brought back in
— are used to calculate these metrics (see <a href="/Articles/495543/">this
article</a> for a description of how refaults are tracked).  Even then,
though, there is a twist, in that a process may need different sets of
pages during different phases of its execution.  To try to detect the
transition between different working sets, the patch set adds tracking of
whether each page has made it to the active list (was used more than
once, essentially) since it was faulted in.  Only the pages that are
actually used are counted
when the stall times are calculated.
<p>
The final file is <tt>/proc/pressure/io</tt>, which tracks the time lost
waiting for I/O.  This number is likely to be more difficult to make good
use of without some sense for what the baseline values should be.  The
block subsystem isn't able to track the amount of extra time spent waiting
due to contention for the device, so the resulting numbers will not be
directly related to that contention.
<p>
The files in <tt>/proc/pressure</tt> track the state of the system as a
whole.  In systems where control groups are in use, there will also be a
set of files (<tt>cpu.pressure</tt>, <tt>memory.pressure</tt>, and
<tt>io.pressure</tt>) associated with each group.  They can be used to
ensure that the resource limits for each group make sense; they should also
make it easier to determine which processes are thrashing on a busy system.
<p>
This functionality has apparently been used within Facebook for some time,
and has helped considerably in the optimization of system resources and the
diagnosis of problems.  "<q>We now log and graph pressure for the
containers in our fleet and 
	can trivially link latency spikes and throughput drops to shortages
	of specific resources after the fact, and fix the job
	config/scheduling</q>", Weiner said.

There is also evidently interest from the Android world, where developers are
looking for better ways of detecting out-of-memory situations before system
performance is entirely lost.  Linus Torvalds has <a
href="/ml/cgroups/CAADWXX_ADRyY+HDyw_2Ofa4b9g1fpCNe8xO3xMf20jfWsyCnQg@mail.gmail.com/">indicated</a>
that the idea looks interesting to him.  There are still some open
questions on how the CPU data is accumulated (see <a
href="/ml/cgroups/20180713161756.GA21168@cmpxchg.org/">this message</a> for
a long explanation), but one assumes that will be worked out before too
long.  So, in all likelihood, the pressure-stall patches will not be
stalled for too long before making it into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Sounds great but... was there no measurement similar to this already? Kolivas and others have been working on bounded latency for a decade or two. I very vaguely remember the lack of measurements/proofs was a point of contention, so maybe that answers my question?<br>

@ALL: Pls. excuse this dump question since beeing a (nearly) newbee linux user, but:<br>
<p>
Which will be the differences to using 'pressure stall information' in contrast to using zram/zswap?<br>
Will this feature only report being a system on less/missing ressources, or will it also manage the  system's reduced/system under 'reduced' ressources?<br>
I am not a very technical guy, but I have always been some kind of very successfull keeping a system still 'breathing' unter high load/reduced memory ressources using a specially configured combination on zswap and zram.<br>
<p>
Thanks to you all and your responses for clearing up my misunderstanding.<br>

      <p>This is orthogonal to zram/zswap.
<p>zram/zswap/ordinary swap provide the kernel with a way to free up memory that's not been recently used in favour of things that are actively in use. Thus, the kernel can keep going when it's out of memory, by freeing up not recently used memory for more useful things.
<p>Pressure Stall Information lets a userspace monitoring system determine whether the system is spending too much time on management overheads (e.g. putting data into zram and taking it back out again) and not enough time doing useful work. You can then act on this to do something clever - e.g. move a job around between servers in a private cloud, terminate optimistic background work (such as indexing a filesystem), alert the user that they need to fix it.

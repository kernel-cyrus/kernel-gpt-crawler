Back in May, André Almeida <a href="/Articles/931789/">presented some
work</a> toward the creation of user-space spinlocks using adaptive
spinning.  At that time, the work was stalled because there is, in Linux,
currently no way to quickly determine whether a given thread is actually
executing on a CPU.  Some progress has since been made on that front; at
the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">2023
Open Source Summit Europe</a>, Almeida returned to discuss how that
difficulty might be overcome.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/944896/"><img

title="André Almeida" class="rthumb"></a>

He started with on overview of locking primitives and how spinlocks, in
particular, work.  In short, a spinlock is so-named because, if it an
attempt to acquire a lock fails, the code will recheck its status in a loop
(thus "spinning") until the lock becomes available.  Spinlocks are
relatively easy to implement in the kernel because, by the rules under
which spinlocks operate, the holder of a lock is
known to be running on a CPU somewhere in the system and should release it
soon; that insures that the CPU time lost to spinning will be small.
<p>
In user space, the story is more complex.  One thread might be spinning on
a lock while the holder has been preempted and isn't running at all.  In
such cases, the lock will not be released soon, and the spinning just
wastes CPU time.  In the worst case, the thread that is spinning may be the
one that is keeping the lock holder from running, meaning that the spinning
thread is actively preventing the lock it needs from being released.  In
such situations, the code should simply stop spinning and go to sleep until
the lock is released.
<p>
Doing that, though, requires a way for the lock-acquisition code to know
that the lock owner is not running.  One could add a system call for that
purpose, but system calls are expensive; in this case, the system-call
overhead might easily overwhelm the time spent in the critical section
protected by the lock.  If it is necessary to call into the kernel, it is
better to just block until the lock is released.  What is really needed is
a way to gain that information <i>without</i> making a system call.
<p>
In the May discussion, the idea of using the <a
href="/Articles/697979/">restartable sequences</a> feature to gain that
information came up.  This subsystem has hooks into the scheduler to track
events like task preemption; it also uses a shared-memory segment to
communicate some of that information to user space.  Perhaps restartable
sequences could be employed to solve this problem as well?
<p>
The maintainer of the restartable sequences code, Mathieu Desnoyers, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230529191416.53955-1-mathieu.desnoyers@efficios.com/">quickly
responded</a> with a patch to implement this functionality.  This patch
adds a new structure member to the <tt>rseq</tt> struct that is shared
between the kernel and user space:
<p>
<pre>
    struct rseq_sched_state {
	/*
	 * Version of this structure. Populated by the kernel, read by
	 * user-space.
	 */
	__u32 version;
	/*
	 * The state is updated by the kernel. Read by user-space with
	 * single-copy atomicity semantics. This field can be read by any
	 * userspace thread. Aligned on 32-bit. Contains a bitmask of enum
	 * rseq_sched_state_flags. This field is provided as a hint by the
	 * scheduler, and requires that the page holding this state is
	 * faulted-in for the state update to be performed by the scheduler.
	 */
	__u32 state;
	/*
	 * Thread ID associated with the thread registering this structure.
	 * Initialized by user-space before registration.
	 */
	__u32 tid;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>state</tt> field, which holds a set of flags describing the
execution state of the process in question, is the key here.  There is only
one flag, <tt>RSEQ_SCHED_STATE_FLAG_ON_CPU</tt>, defined.  Whenever the
thread associated with this structure is placed onto a CPU for execution,
this flag will be set; if the thread stops running for any reason, the flag
is cleared again.
<p>
This information is enough for the implementation of adaptive spinning in
user space.  If an attempt to acquire a spinlock fails, the first step is
to check the <tt>rseq_sched_state</tt> of the thread holding the lock (this
implicitly requires that this communication is happening between threads
that can access each other's restartable-sequences state).  If
that check shows that the thread is running, then it makes sense to spin
waiting for the lock to be freed (with a check inside the loop, of course,
to detect the case where the holder is subsequently preempted).  Otherwise,
a system call is made to simply block until the lock is freed.
<p>
That said, Almeida concluded by saying that he is still not entirely sure
if this idea lives up to its potential.  There is work to be done to
optimize cache behavior, integrate adaptive spinning into the POSIX threads
locking primitives, and do a lot of benchmarking work.  But the approach
appears to have promise, and the rest is just work.

      The VDSO, as you note, is per-process; in truth, it's a global page.  The <tt>rseq()</tt> area, instead, is per-thread, which is what is needed here.

Can VDSO be modified to include a per-process page? This would still allow to just use a regular symbol resolution to get the rseq() data. <br>

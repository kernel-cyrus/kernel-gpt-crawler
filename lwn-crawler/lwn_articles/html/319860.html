<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 18, 2009</br>
           </div>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/318611/">Last week's article on
wakelocks</a> described a suspend-inhibiting interface which derives
from the Android project and the hostile reaction that interface received.
Since then, the discussion has continued in two separate threads.  Kernel
developers, like engineers everywhere, are problem solvers, so the
discussion has shifted away from criticism of wakelocks and toward the
search for an acceptable solution.  As of this writing, that solution does
not exist, but we have learned some interesting things about the problem
space. 
<p>

Getting Linux power management to work well has been a long, drawn-out
process, much of which involves fixing device drivers and applications, one
at a time.  There is also a lot of work which has gone into ensuring that
the CPU remains in an idle state as much as possible.  One of the reasons
that some developers found the wakelock interface jarring was that the
Android developers chose a different approach to power management.  Rather
than minimize power consumption at any given time, the Android code simply
tries to suspend the entire device whenever possible.  There are a couple
of reasons for this approach, one of which we will get to below.
<p>
But we'll start with a very simple reason why Android goes for the "suspend the entire
world" solution: because they can.  The hardware that Android runs on, like
many embedded systems (but unlike most x86-based systems), has been
designed to suspend and resume quickly.  So 
the Android developers see no reason to do things any other way.  But that
leads to comments like <a href="/Articles/319863/">this one from Matthew
Garrett</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Part of the reason you're getting pushback is that your solution to
	the problem of shutting down unused hardware is tied to
	embedded-style systems with very low resume latencies. You can
	afford to handle the problem by entering an explicit suspend
	state. In the x86 mobile world, we don't have that option. It's
	simply too slow and disruptive to the user experience. As a
	consequence we're far more interested in hardware power management
	that doesn't require an explicit system-wide suspend.
<p>
	A solution that's focused on powering down as much unused hardware
	as possible regardless of the system state benefits the x86 world
	as well as the embedded world, so I think there's a fairly strong
	argument that it's a better solution than one requiring an explicit
	system state change.
</div>
<p>
Matthew also notes that it's possible to solve the power management problem
without fully suspending the system; he gives the Nokia tablets as an
example of a successful implementation which uses finer-grained power
management.
<p>
That said, it seems clear that the full-suspend approach to power
management is not going to go away.  Some hardware is designed to work best
that way, so Linux needs to support that mode of operation.  So there has
been some talk about how to design wakelocks in a way which fits better
into the kernel as a whole.  On the kernel side, there is some dispute as
to whether the wakelock mechanism is needed at all; drivers can already
inhibit an attempt by the kernel to suspend the system.  But there is some
justice to the claim that it's better if the kernel knows it can't suspend
the system without having to poll every driver.
<p>
One simple solution, <a href="/Articles/319869/">proposed by Matthew</a>,
would be a simple pair of functions: <tt>inhibit_suspend()</tt> and
<tt>uninhibit_suspend()</tt>.  On production systems, they would
manipulate an atomic counter; when the counter is zero, the system can be
suspended.  These functions could take a <tt>device</tt> structure as an
argument; debugging versions could then track which devices are blocking a
suspend at any given time.  The user-space equivalent could be a file like
<tt>/dev/inhibit_suspend</tt>; as long as at least one process holds that
file open, the system will continue to run.  All told, it looks like a
simple API without many of the problems seen in the wakelock code.
<p>
There were a few complaints from the Android side, but the biggest sticking
point appears to be over timeouts.  The wakelock API implements an
automatic timeout which causes the "lock" to go away after a given time.
There appear to be a few reasons for the existence of the timeouts:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Since not all drivers use the wakelock API, timeouts are required to
     prevent suspending the system while those drivers are running.  The
     proposed solution to this one is to instrument all of the drivers
     which need to keep the system running.  Once an acceptable API is
     merged into the kernel, drivers can be modified as needed.

<p>
<li> If a process holding a wakelock dies unexpectedly, the timeout will
     keep the system running while the watchdog code restarts the faulting
     process.  The problem here is that timeouts encode a recovery policy
     in the kernel and do little to ensure that operation is actually
     correct.  What has been proposed instead is that the user-space
     "inhibit suspend" policy be encapsulated into a separate daemon which
     would make the decisions on when to keep the system awake.
<p>
<li> User-space applications may simply screw up and forget to allow the
     system to suspend.
</ul>
<p>
The final case above is also used as an argument for the full-suspend
approach to power management.  Even if an ill-behaved application goes into
a loop and refuses to quit, the system will eventually suspend and save its
battery anyway.  This is an argument which does not fly particularly well
with a lot of kernel developers, who respond that, rather than coding the
kernel to protect against poor applications, one should simply fix those
applications.  Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/319874/">points out</a>
that, since the advent of <a href="http://linuxpowertop.org/">PowerTop</a>,
the bulk of the problems with open-source applications have been fixed.
<p>
In this space, though, it is harder to get a handle on all of these
problems.  Brian Swetland <a href="/Articles/319875/">describes the
situation</a> this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<ul>
<li> carrier deploys a device 
<li> carrier agrees to allow installation of arbitrary third party apps
  without some horrible certification program requiring app authors
  to jump through hoops, wait ages for approval, etc
<li> users rejoice and install all kinds of apps
<li> some apps are poorly written and impact battery life
<li> users complain to carrier about battery life
</ul>
</div>
<p>
Matthew also <a href="/Articles/319876/">acknowledges the problem</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Remember that Android has an open marketplace designed to appeal to
	Java programmers - users are going to end up downloading code from
	there and then blaming the platform if their battery life heads
	towards zero. I think "We can't trust our userland not to be dumb"
	is a valid concern.
</div>
<p>
It is a real problem, but it still is not at all clear that attempts to fix
such problems in the kernel are advisable - or that they will be successful
in the end.  Ben Herrenschmidt <a href="/Articles/319877/">offers</a> a
different solution: a daemon which monitors application behavior and warns
the user when a given application is seen to be behaving badly.  That would
at least let users know where the real problem is.  But it is, of course,
no substitute for the real solution: run open-source applications on the
phone so that poor behavior can be fixed by users if need be.
<p>
The Android platform is explicitly designed to enable proprietary
applications, though.  It may prove to be able to attract those
applications in a way which standard desktop Linux has never quite managed
to do.  So some sort of solution to the problem of power management in the
face of badly-written applications will need to be found.  The Android
developers like wakelocks as that solution for now, but they also appear to
be interested in working with the community to find a more
globally-acceptable solution.  What that solution will look like, though,
is unlikely to become clear without a lot more discussion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmm, I don't agree with that. Isn't it after all similar to memory <br>
protection ? If we would trust all userspace applications to be bugfree <br>
and not access memory which is not theirs, there would be no need for <br>
protected memory.<br>
In the same way this protects the system against programs behaving badly <br>
memory-wise, some protection against applications behaving badly <br>
power-consumtion-wise seems like a good thing to me.<br>

      <p>If you run some wild application you can make your system slow down so 
much that sshing to it and killing offending process is impossible. Somehow 
the answer "fix your userspace" was never considered "good enough" and 
years were spent developing many systems (quotas, cotainers, VMs) to make 
it safe to run any application and still have control over system.</p>

<p>Sure: any application will consume resources. But with phone you need 
guarantee that consumed resources (all resources including power) are 
limited by some arbitrary value. If it's enough for program - it'll work 
great, if not - I can decide if fancy screen-saver worth giving it half of battery resources.</p>

<p>The same story as with preemptive vs cooperative multitasking: cooperative multitasking works great if you have control over all programs 
(see Novel Netware 3.x), but if not - it's disaster (see Windows 3.x and/or 
MacOS before MacOS X).</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt you can save as much power by using any other approach. XO tried to do this, G1 is doing this - I'm pretty sure it'll be standard approach in some niches for years to come. And why should a single poorly-written application be able to suck your battery dry if system is designed to mostly live in suspended mode?</p>

<p>Kernel already is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296419/">doing things like that</a>. Only there kernel guarantees small amount of time for "normal" process here it gurantees only small amount of work time for any process. Different systems, different requirements...</p>

XO is a different case - the runtime idle states on x86 are signifiantly higher power draw than on modern SoCs. OMAP and the MSM chips used in the G1 are effectively equivalent in runtime idle and suspended states. The concept of a "suspended mode" is dying out in many markets, so optimising for it is foolish. Nokia have succeeded in demonstrating that it's unnecessary when you have the appropriate hardware support.<br>

Nokia (and TI really) have demonstrated that with near-infinite hardware knobs and Herculean software effort, you can pull this off.  But the methods are not generalizable to other platforms, scalable, or IMHO sustainable in the long-term.<br>

For functional deep runtime power management, you need three things:<br>
<p>
1) The hardware to support it. That's increasingly the case - multiple vendors provide this kind of functionality.<br>
2) The OS to support high quality driver power management. That requires paying attention to application requirements and aggressively reducing the power consumption of hardware when those requirements are relaxed.<br>
3) The userspace applications not to use resources unnecessarily, or some way to actively prevent them from being given them.<br>
<p>
(1) is entirely out of our control. For hardware that supports low-latency full-system suspend/resume and doesn't support ultra low-power runtime idle modes, we don't have any option - the only solution is some sort of automatic system suspend.<br>
<p>
However, I'm going to argue that that's not especially interesting. Hardware that falls into this category is a decreasing proportion of the market. ARM is mostly heading towards supporting sufficiently deep runtime idle. x86 doesn't have sufficiently low-latency suspend/resume for automatic suspend to be practical. Optimising for this scenario is optimising for a dying market segment.<br>
<p>
(2) and (3) are interesting because they benefit the entire Linux market, not merely a segment of the embedded market. Enhancing our driver framework allows us to save power in everything from the phone to the server. Ensuring that our software stack doesn't engage in pathological behaviour provides the same benefits.<br>
<p>
Concentrating on wakelocks simply ignores the reality that they provide no benefit in most usecases. In the Android case, they're a bandaid to hide inadequacies in other software layers.<br>

There's actually lot to be said for that. Protected memory mechanisms back on the early 286 CPU's were documented as debugging tools, as they would trap illegal memory accesses, point to where they're occuring, so the software could then be fixed. Assuming all-correct, trusted, and playing-nicely-together software, being able to remove protected and virtual memory mechanisms could actually make a lot of things run a lot lot faster, although of course with downsides too, such as losing automatic copy-on-write memory pages that makes other things run much quicker (like fork()ing). I seem to recall that much stuff that's been launched into space will often do away with memory protection mechanisms as it makes the silicon much simpler.<br>
<p>
If we had the man hours to put into the software that would be great, but, it's cheaper to protect against human error (and malace) instead by using software and circuitry. This is often resisted as many feel the desire to Do It Right, but then you get things like probes on Mars deadlocking, and kernel guys going "let's just implement priority inheritance to get it working". I seem to recall Linus being resisant to priority inheritance in the Linux kernel, but eventually an implementation did get in (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/178253/">http://lwn.net/Articles/178253/</a>). Whilst this may not be Doing It Right, it is definitely Doing the Right Thing.<br>

Memory protection is just as necessary for security on a multi-user operating system as it is for crash protection. Without it, any application that crashed or decided to be malicious could corrupt just about anything on the system.<br>
<p>
Memory protection is also largely implemented in hardware, and is a fundamental component of how multiple processes can coexist on one computer and still appear to run simultaneously. <br>
<p>
That's wayyyyyy different from adding hacks to the kernel to fix broken applications. That reduces kernel quality and encourages app developers to be lazy. It's something Microsoft would do -- add kernel hacks to make Office or Borland work right.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; What has been proposed instead is that the user-space "inhibit suspend"</font><br>

      Such a daemon could also allow some applications to hold the phone active 
for a longer time&mdash;for example, media players or games.
<p>
It could even use the Android permissions model to decide which 
applications get this preferential treatment.

      They could, but I would guess the VM is not very smart either -- it does whatever userspace tells it to do. Solving the problem in the not-quite-Java VM would add complexity in a layer which (at least theoretically) is not involved in power management, just in secure execution.
<p>
Besides, there will be other native applications running on the G1, which (even if they under direct control of Goog... ahem, Android) must be written with power management in mind. It seems easier to just push power management to the kernel and let it do its thing.

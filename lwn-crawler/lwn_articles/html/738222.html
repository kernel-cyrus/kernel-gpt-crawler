<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2017">2017 Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
Laurent Pinchart ran a session at the 2017 Embedded Linux Conference Europe
entitled "Bash the kernel maintainers"; the idea was to get feedback from
developers on their experience working with the kernel community.  A few
days later, the Maintainers Summit held a free-flowing discussion on the
issues that were brought up in that session.  Some changes may result from
this discussion, but it also showed how hard it can be to change how kernel
subsystem maintainers work.

<p>
The first complaint was that there is no consistency in how maintainers
respond to patches.  Some will acknowledge them right away, others take
their time, and others will sometimes ignore patches altogether.  James
Bottomley defended the last group, saying that it is simply not possible to
respond to all of the patches that show up on the mailing lists.  The
discussions can get nasty or, with some posters, a maintainer can end up
stuck in a never-ending circle of questions and reposts.  Arnd Bergmann
suggested that maintainers could adopt a standard no-reply reply for such
situations.
<p>
Laura Abbott said that the low-quality patches tend to be cleanup work, but
there are also plenty of developers doing feature work who would appreciate
more consistent maintainer responses.  Bottomley said that such
developers know what they are doing with regard to working with the
community already, but Bergmann disagreed.  Bottomley went on to say that
the best way to get a response to a feature patch is to recruit other users
to say that they, too, are interested in that feature.  He is not
interested in merging features that have a single user.  Finding these

<a href="/Articles/738224/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/osse/LaurentPinchart-sm.jpg" alt="[Laurent
Pinchart]" title="Laurent Pinchart" class="lthumb"></a>

users should not be hard, he said; developers working for companies already
have a user base to draw from.  When he was working at Parallels, he said,
he was able to go out and find users to push for patches that had been
languishing.
<p>
Shuah Khan said that there is a lot of inconsistency around when submitters
should ping maintainers for a response.  Bottomley replied that his "rule
number one" for SCSI patches is that submitters must find a developer to
review their work. Bergmann said that he knows that the SCSI subsystem
works that way, but noted that other subsystems have different rules.  In
each case, the specific rules in force make sense to the maintainers
involved.  For the core ARM tree, for example, patches have to be added to
the maintainer's patch tracker.  In the virtual filesystem (VFS) area, patches
have to be "really good", at which point they will silently appear in a
mainline pull request.  Linus Torvalds added that, for VFS patches, the
maintainer tends to be more responsive if Torvalds is copied on patches.
Patches for networking code always get a timely response.  Ben
Herrenschmidt said that he often gets responses rejecting patches for
"stupid stuff" (trivial issues like coding style) and that he finds it
frustrating. 
<p>
Torvalds said that it will never be possible for all of the kernel's
subsystems to be consistent in their handling of patches.  Different
subsystems have different models of development that have grown over time.
The networking subsystem is good at taking patches, he said, because that's
simply how the maintainer (Dave Miller) works; the patchwork system also
works well for him.  "But nobody else should try to be Dave".  A better
approach, he said, might be to create better documentation of each
subsystem's rules.
<p>
Herrenschmidt said that the community likes to complain about companies
that are shipping a lot of out-of-tree code.  We would like them to get
that code into the mainline.  But that task is frustrating and demotivating
now, so many of these companies decide that it's not worth the effort; the
community needs to make it easier.  He repeated that some maintainers are
overly obnoxious about trivial issues, making it hard to get large work
upstream.  The fact that the rules vary across subsystems and are not
written down makes it worse.
<p>
The group concluded that an effort should be made to document each
subsystem's rules for patch acceptance.  The information might be added to
the <a
href="http://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/process/submitting-patches.html">submitting-patches</a>
document, though that document is already far too long.  Perhaps,
eventually, the <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> script could be enhanced with a
better understanding of subsystem-specific rules.  The documentation is
hopefully forthcoming in the near future but, at the session, the
documentation maintainer warned that his rules for patch acceptance are
especially nasty.
<p>
Moving on, Pinchart noted that the community could make an effort to be
nicer to new developers, preferably in a way that doesn't frustrate existing
developers.  He noted, for example, that the automated emails from the
0-day testing service can seem harsh â€” the first response to a first-time
patch is essentially an automated criticism.  Perhaps, he said, the
messages could explain that they originate from a robot and should not be
taken personally.  Dan Williams said that he has arranged for separate
0-day testing just to avoid this sort of situation.
<p>
There was a suggestion to set up a new mailing list for the purpose of
running a specific patch through the testing service.  One potential
problem is that 
the robot currently generates no reply if it finds no problems with the
patch; that would have to change in this setting.  Silence in response to
patches, Kees Cook noted, is demotivating.  Torvalds suggested that 0-day
replies could start with "I love you but..."; Fengguang Wu, who was at the
Summit, seems to have already <a href="/Articles/738223/">made some
changes</a> in that direction.  Pinchart said that he always starts off a
review by thanking the submitter for the patch and that he often offers a
Reviewed-by 
tag if specific changes are made.  That gives both a positive message and a
hint of light at the end of the tunnel that can help new submitters.
<p>
Patch submitters could benefit from better feedback on how to fix problems,
especially in cases where reviewers give conflicting advice.  In such
cases, it was said, the maintainer needs to take a stand to resolve the
situation, but Bottomley said that, if reviewers cannot agree on a patch,
he doesn't want it at all.  It is up to the submitter, he said, to bring the
reviewers to some sort of agreement.  Herrenschmidt complained that, sometimes,
patches are simply bikeshedded to death; Ted Ts'o suggested escalating to
Torvalds when that happens.  Torvalds added that he will indeed route
around obstructive maintainers when he has to.
<p>
There was a brief discussion regarding a current patch logjam in the SCSI
target subsystem.  The maintainers agreed that they would go ahead and take
the more straightforward changes in an attempt to move things forward.
<p>
Sometimes an interesting patch becomes abandoned, often because the
developer has moved on to other tasks.  Perhaps reviving such patches
would be a good project for an Outreachy intern.  Bottomley said that one
useful signal about the wisdom of accepting a specific patch is whether it
is being pushed consistently; that suggests that the developer will be
around to deal with problems after it is merged.  Torvalds agreed that the
abandonment of a patch says something, and that such patches probably
should not be applied.
<p>
The problem of developers who have limited time to get a patch merged
remains, though.  Ts'o said that he will make an effort to respond quickly
to developers who are known to be going away soon â€” interns, for example.
Herrenschmidt said that he has seen some maintainers giving rude responses
to developers who are working under deadlines.  Bottomley responded that
such patches are often created by contractors; they tend to be bad and are
best left out.  But such patches then just languish in some Android vendor
tree, which is not a good outcome either.  Ts'o said that the community's
normal expectation is that the developer of a patch will stay around to
maintain it after merging; Herrenschmidt agreed that contractors need to
have some sort of convincing maintenance story for their work.
<p>
The topic of aggressive behavior on the mailing lists came up; it was
agreed that all developers should call out such behavior when they see it.
Bottomley wondered what the problem was, since the mailing lists have been
steadily calming down for years.  Apparently one remaining problem is
perceived aggression in commit messages, where the changelog for a fix will
say unflattering things about the patch that introduced the problem in the
first place.  There was relatively little sympathy in this case, though.
<p>
There is evidently at least one company that will not assign female
developers to specific subsystems because of problems that have been
experienced in the past.  Everybody agreed that such situations should be
taken immediately to the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board for
resolution.
<p>
At the end of the session, Pinchart said that he was thinking about
starting some sort of maintainer survey, patterned on the teacher
evaluations used at many universities.  This effort is likely to proceed,
initially as an opt-in mechanism for maintainers who are interested.  The
feedback provided would be anonymized and would not be made public.

I try to make Smatch warn emails sound as robotic and unnatural as a signal that people shouldn't reply to them.  But I still had a long thread where someone was offended to the wording ("bug report" because it implied a flaw in their perfect source.)<br>
<p>
I think the new 0day warning email format are a mistake because they don't sound robotic enough.  "Hi Dan, Thank you for the patch!  Here are some potential areas for improvement:" followed by Gcc errors showing that it breaks the build.<br>

<p>
I don't think this is a useful attitude; the treatment of a company who highlights this sort of thing is very rarely positive and often an expensive PR disaster; that doesn't mean that a warning sign should be ignored because there are no names publicised with it. Sexist behaviour is not rare in the tech sector; discrediting reports because they don't have names associated is not going to help that. <br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 3, 2023</br>
           </div>
The C language is expressive in many ways, but it still does not have ways
to express many of the relationships between fields in a data structure.
That gap can be at least partially filled, though, if one is willing to
create and use non-standard extensions.  The adoption of of those
extensions, in the form of the <tt>__counted_by()</tt> macro, has been
merged for the 6.5 kernel release, even though the compiler feature it
depends on has not yet been finalized.
<p>
Flexible arrays <strike>(also known as variable-length arrays)</strike> are
arrays defined within a structure with a length that is only known at run
time:
<p>
<pre>
    struct flex {
        int count;
	struct some_item items[];
    };
</pre>
<p>
When a structure of this type is allocated at run time, the number of items
to be stored within it will be known; enough memory will be allocated to
hold an <tt>items</tt> array of the expected size.  Normally such
structures will include a field saying how long the array is; the
<tt>count</tt> field in the above example could be used this way.  But
there is no way for the compiler (or any other tool) to know about the
association between <tt>count</tt> and the length of <tt>items</tt>.
<p>
Flexible arrays, by their nature, are particularly prone to a number of
memory-safety bugs.  It is, thus, not surprising that <a
href="/Articles/908817/">work has been ongoing</a> for some time in the
kernel-hardening community to clean up and regularize the code that deals
with these arrays in the kernel.  As of the 6.5 release, warnings will be
generated by code that uses anything other than the standard notation to
declare a flexible array (<tt>array[]</tt> rather than the once-common
<tt>array[0]</tt> or even <tt>array[1]</tt>).  But flexible arrays are
still opaque to code that wants to check whether a given reference falls
within or outside of the allocated memory, for the simple reason that the
actual size of the array is determined at run time and is not known to the
compiler or other tools.
<p>
That information usually is available, though; it's just that the compiler
does not know where to find it.  In an attempt to fill in that information,
requests were filed with both the <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108896">GCC</a> and <a
href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D148381">LLVM</a> communities to support a
new variable attribute to indicate which structure field contains the
length of a variable array.  Using this attribute, the above structure
could be declared as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct flex {
        int count;
	struct some_item items[] __attribute__((element_count("count")));
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here, the new <tt>element_count</tt> attribute says that the length of
<tt>items</tt> (in elements, not bytes) is stored in the field
<tt>count</tt> in the same structure.  The compiler can use that
information to calculate the size of the array; that, in turn, can be used
to provide run-time bounds checking for accesses to the array.  The result
should be a kernel that is a little harder to exploit and better
documentation of how the structure's fields relate to each other.
<p>
In the kernel, this new attribute is hidden behind a macro:
<p>
<pre>
    # define __counted_by(member) __attribute__((__element_count__(#member)))
</pre>
<p>
This macro makes the code more concise, which is nice, but it is needed for
another reason as well.  The actual naming of the <tt>element_count</tt>
attribute is not yet set in stone, and might well change (probably to
<tt>counted_by</tt>) before compilers with support for it are released.
Once the name settles down, the macro can be changed to match.
<p>
Kees Cook, who has done the work of supporting this attribute in the
kernel, is ready to go with the next step: <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=adc5b3cb48a049563dc673f348eab7b6beba8a9b">annotating
over 150 files</a> with the new attribute.  Those are the relatively easy
cases, found with the Coccinelle tool; others are sure to follow.
<p>
Christoph Hellwig, while welcoming the feature in general, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZJvRFZeYq6ZWLAWj@infradead.org/">worried</a> that it
was being introduced too soon:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	But this feels a bit premature to me, not only due to the ongoing
	discussions on the syntax, but more importantly because I fear it
	will be completely misused before we have a compiler actually
	supporting available widely enough that we have it in the usual
	test bots.
</blockquote>
<p>
Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202306280920.CB69D0F75@keescook/">answered</a> that
he has test systems running with the compiler patches and should be able to
catch any incorrect annotations that show up in the near future.
Meanwhile, though, he wants to get started marking up the code:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This has been a pain point for years as we've been doing flexible
	array conversions, since when doing the work it usually becomes
	clear which struct member is tracking the element count, but that
	information couldn't be reliably recorded anywhere. Now we can
	include the annotation (which is the really important part). [...]
<p>
	But I really want to start capturing the associations _now_, and
	get us all into the habit of doing it, and I want it to be through
	some kind of regular syntax (now that there are patches to both GCC
	and Clang that can validate the results), not just comments.
</blockquote>
<p>
That reasoning was clearly enough for Linus Torvalds, who pulled this
change into the mainline during the 6.5 merge window.  This new macro is
another example of the kernel community extending the version of C language
it uses in an attempt to address some of C's legendary safety issues.  We
should all gain a slightly more secure and better documented kernel as a
result.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

These other-language bindings are generally done by programs that use a C parser to analyze a C library's API and produce C code that would call it correctly. When there's a list of records, this currently requires recognizing a naming convention or something in order to interface between a language with built-in data structures with embedded lengths and C. This attribute would tell you the correct answer directly.<br>

Binding generators for other languages read C header files, but the C headers (without this attribute) don't say how big a flexible array member is, making the bindings necessarily unsafe. With this attribute, binding generators could generate safer bindings, because they know how long the array is.<br>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>September 24, 2008</br>

<p>
A subtle change in 2.6.25 recently left Andrew Morton with a less than
completely functioning system, but it also demonstrated a user-space
interface that may sometimes be overlooked: SELinux.  The problem stemmed
from a change to facilitate containers by making <tt>/proc/net</tt> into a
symbolic link, which tripped up SELinux policies that had been
written for earlier kernels.  Putting policy into user space is a guiding
principle of kernel development, but that can sometimes lead to an unexpected
synchronization required between those policies and the kernel.  
</p>

<p>
The change itself was fairly minor, making <tt>/proc/net</tt> be a symbolic
link to <tt>/proc/self/net</tt> so that containers would only see their
network devices, rather than those of the enclosing system.  But when
Morton ran a recent kernel on his Fedora Core 5 and 6 systems, he <a
href="/Articles/300185/">got</a>:
<pre>
    sony:/home/akpm> ifconfig -a
    Warning: cannot open /proc/net/dev (Permission denied). Limited output.
</pre>
Further investigation found that even <tt>ls</tt> got permission errors
when looking at <tt>/proc/net</tt>.  As is usual with mysterious
"permission denied" errors, SELinux was the underlying cause.
</p>

<p>
When the change was made, back in March, it was reviewed by the SELinux
developers, but no one noticed that it would cause an additional permission
check&mdash;on the symbolic link itself.  So, when resolving things like
<tt>/proc/net/dev</tt> or other entries in that directory, the "labels" on
the symbolic link were checked.  Of course, <tt>/proc</tt> is a synthetic
filesystem, so the labels are generated from SELinux code rather than
retrieved from extended attributes (xattrs).
</p>

<p>
Distributions have updated their policies to allow access to the symbolic
link&mdash;probably by noticing the SELinux denial in log messages&mdash;so
most folks 
never saw the problem.  As Morton found out, though, existing distribution
policy files 
(those shipped with FC5 and FC6 for
example) would still disallow the access.  Morton regularly runs newer
kernels with older distributions to try to catch exactly this kind of
error; he is probably one of very few, perhaps the only one, doing that.
</p>

<p>
Because the distribution-supplied kernel was being changed, some argued
that requiring users to update their SELinux policies is not an onerous
requirement. 
  Paul Moore <a href="/Articles/300218/">puts it this
way</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote">
 Maybe 
I'm in the minority here, but in my mind once you step away from the 
distro supplied kernel (also applies to other packages, although those 
are arguably less critical) you should also bear the responsibility to 
make sure you upgrade/tweak/install whatever other bits need to be 
fixed.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Morton did not buy that argument <a href="/Articles/300219/">saying</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Nope.  Releasing a non-backward-compatible kernel.org kernel is a big
deal.
<p>
We'll do it sometimes, with long notice, much care and much deliberation.
<p>
We did it this time by sheer accident.  That's known in the trade as a
"bug".
</div>
</p>

<p>
But SELinux developer Stephen Smalley points out that permissions checks
are not normally considered part of the kernel to user space interface.  It
is something of a gray area, though.  Clearly the standard UNIX permission
checks <i>are</i> part of that interface, at least partially because the
kernel does handle the policy for those checks.  Since the policies that
govern the decisions about SELinux
access denial come from user space, it is a bit hard to argue that
changes to the kernel will not ripple out.  Smalley <a
href="/Articles/300223/">describes</a> the problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
I should note here that for changes to SELinux, we have gone out of our
way to avoid such breakage to date through the introduction of
compatibility switches, policy flags to enable any new checks, etc
(albeit at a cost in complexity and ever creeping compatibility code).
But changes to the rest of the kernel can just as easily alter the set
of permission checks that get applied on a given operation, and I don't
think we are always going to be able to guarantee that new kernel + old
policy will Just Work. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
One possible solution to the immediate problem was floated by Smalley:
SELinux could change the 
label that it returns for symbolic links under <tt>/proc</tt>.  It is not
clear that anyone really wants that change, and there has been no movement
to add it.   As Morton <a
href="/Articles/300238/">says</a>, "<q>people who are shipping 2.6.25-
and 2.6.26-based distros probably 
wouldn't want such a patch in their kernels anyway</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Longer term, Eric Biederman <a href="/Articles/300239/">asks</a> about
supporting xattrs for <tt>/proc</tt>.  That would allow user space to label
the proc filesystem appropriately, removing one of the special cases.
Unfortunately, doing so would create yet another incompatibility between
newer kernels and older user spaces.  
</p>

<p>
In the end, because the bug was only seen
by Morton, many months after it was introduced, it may just be ignored.
The larger issue of how permissions checks fit into the kernel to user
space interface, though, may rear its head again.

FWIW, a patch may go in which fixes this class of problem (i.e. symlinks in /proc arising from namespacing).<br>

It still seems to me that life is just to short for SELinux. It's way too complex. Complexity is bad for security too, you can't reasonably secure what you can't even properly understand.<br>
<p>
Does it actually in the real world help ? What's the last security-problem where users with SELinux on where spared whereas the rest of us where vulnerable ?<br>

      Andrew Morton is not the only one who upgrades existing distros with new kernel.org
kernels.  I do it, too.  E.g., I ran 2.6.25.6 on Debian Etch until
about a month ago when I upgraded the distro to Lenny (keeping the
kernel).  I was not bitten by the bug because I don't use SELinux (and
plan to avoid it as long as possible).

As a normal rule, kernel developers do not like papering over problems or
putting in hacks to hide those problems.  Though a recently posted <a
href="/Articles/598462/">patch</a> to apply just such a hack seems unlikely
to actually be merged, it was generally well received and does demonstrate
an interesting use of this technique.  When all hope for a proper fix to a
problematic subsystem appears to be lost, perhaps it's time for desperate
measures.
<p>
The subsystem in question is the one that handles CPU hotplugging.  There
are a number of 
reasons why one might want to add a CPU to (or remove a CPU from) a running
system: 
the hardware may actually support physical addition or removal of CPUs, or
one might want to 
offline a misbehaving processor.  In the virtualization world, CPU
hotplugging is an obvious way to adjust the processing power available to
specific guests as they run.  The feature clearly has value, and nobody
would seriously suggest removing it.  But nobody is happy with how CPU
hotplugging has been implemented.
<p>
Changing the set of CPUs in a running system is a complex task; there is a
vast amount of per-CPU state at numerous levels that must be managed.  In
such a situation, it makes sense to have an overall mechanism that manages
the complexity, breaks it down into simple steps, and ensures that those
steps are run in the correct order.  Unfortunately, the Linux kernel does
not have that sort of mechanism; instead, it has a confusing array of
notifiers and callbacks that is hard to reason about or make changes to.
And, unsurprisingly, it has bugs; developers who have gone looking for bugs
in this area have had little trouble finding them.
<p>
In fact, bugs in this area are so plentiful that Borislav Petkov wants to
make them harder to find.  His patch introduction reads:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We have all those eager tester dudes which scratch up a dirty
	script to pound on CPU hotplug senselessly and then report bugs
	they've managed to trigger.
<p>
	Well, first of all, most, if not all, bugs they trigger are CPU
	hotplug related anyway. But we know hotplug is full of duct tape
	and brown paper bags. So we end up clearly wasting too much time
	dealing with a mechanism we know it is b0rked in the first place.
</div>
<p>
His solution was simple: insert a one-second delay into each CPU hotplug
operation.  Slowing things in that way minimizes the number of operations
that can be tested and the amount of concurrency between operations.  It
should reduce the flow of bug reports nicely.
<p>
There is one tiny little problem, of course: this patch does not actually
fix any 
bugs; it just hides them from view.  Andrew Morton was quick to <a
href="/Articles/598466/">point out</a> that this patch would almost
certainly result in fewer CPU hotplug bugs being fixed.  But Thomas
Gleixner <a href="/Articles/598468/">thinks that may be a good thing</a>:
"<q>if people would have spent the same amount of time to rewrite the
hotplug mess, we would have a way bigger benefit. But no, we prefer to add
more layers of duct tape and bandaid hackery to it.</q>"
<p>
Thomas, of course, has in the past tried to do just that sort of rewrite;
that work was <a href="/Articles/537562/">covered here</a> in February
2013.   He took the time to break the hotplug and hotunplug operations down
into a long list of discrete steps; he then built a system to run those steps
in a well-defined order.  It was a far cry from a full solution to the
problem; most of the existing hotplug code remained in place and was just
called differently.  But it provided a framework on which a more complete
rewrite could be done over time.
<p>
The only problem is: nobody did that rewrite.  Thomas ran out of time and
moved back to other tasks, and nobody else picked up the work, so the
patches have languished since their initial posting.  The work that has
been done in that area, instead, is the application of increasingly complex
bug fixes (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/6/475">recent example</a>)
as problems turn up and developers try to make the existing implementation
work.  These fixes may address specific bugs, but they do not address the
complexity and unmaintainability of the system as a whole; indeed, they
tend to make those problems worse.
<p>
It is frustration with the addition of more "duct tape and brown paper bags" that
led to Borislav's patch to slow the hotplug system down.  In the end, the
developers who have to work with this part of the code don't <i>want</i>
more bug fixes; they want the code to be made simpler and easier to
understand so that, in the end, there will not be a need for an endless
stream of fixes that just add more complexity to the code.  Making it
harder to find bugs in this subsystem is a heavy-handed way of trying to direct
developers' attention elsewhere.
<p>
Naturally, the patch is more of a statement than a serious attempt to
change the kernel; it would be surprising if this patch were merged.  In a
world where kernel subsystem maintainers cannot force developers to work on
a specific area, and where no company managers have seen fit to direct
their employees to solve the CPU hotplug problem, one has to be creative
sometimes to get things done.  One might hope that this patch posting would
be a strong enough hint to get somebody to work on the problem.
Unfortunately, Thomas may have inadvertently sabotaged that effort by
saying that, if nobody else gets around to rewriting the hotplug CPU
subsystem, he will jump back in and do it himself.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is a great technique! I've worked on projects where we 'broke' troublesome start/cancel interfaces at the beginning of a release cycle. QA would then have time to focus on more important issues like 'does the product actually work?' rather than 'can I pound it with this corner case script for days with no faults'. Seemed to help overall quality a lot!<br>

<h1>Low latency for audio applications</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 26, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/118785/">Two weeks ago</a>, this page
looked at the realtime security module, an addition requested by Linux
users who need to be able to ensure that certain applications are able to
respond quickly to external events.  Musicians working with Linux, in
particular, want a system which can keep up with audio streams - a task
which requires sub-millisecond response in many cases.  Unpatched Linux
kernels have generally not been able to provide latencies that low in any
sort of reliable way.

<p>

The idea of merging the realtime module appears to have been dropped for
now; the opposition was too strong.  There are a couple of other approaches
which are being worked on, however, to meet the audio developers' needs.
In particular, Con Kolivas and Ingo Molnar have been creating patches, and
audio hacker Jack O'Quin has been tirelessly testing them out. Two
approaches which look like they could solve the problem have emerged from
this work.

<p>
The approach taken by Con Kolivas is the <a
href="/Articles/120750/">isochronous scheduler patch</a>.  This patch, in
its current form, creates two new scheduling classes: <tt>SCHED_ISO_RR</tt>
and <tt>SCHED_ISO_FIFO</tt>.  These classes function much like the realtime
scheduling classes in that they provide a higher scheduling priority than
any <tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt> process enjoys.  They differ from the true
realtime classes, however, in a couple of ways.  No privilege is required
to enter one of the isochronous classes, so audio applications need not run
as root.  The scheduler will also automatically select an isochronous class
if an unprivileged application attempts to enter a true realtime class,
with the result that many audio applications can use the new classes
without modification.
<p>

The isochronous classes give high-priority access to the CPU, but only to a
point.  If isochronous processes use more than an administrator-defined
percentage of the processor (70% by default), they get dropped back to the
<tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt> class for a while.  This feature prevents
high-priority, unprivileged tasks from taking over the system entirely.
This is an important feature - the lack of any such protection was the
reason for many of the objections to the realtime security module.
<p>

Ingo Molnar's <a href="/Articles/120587/">approach</a>, instead, is the
creation of a new resource limit (initially called
<tt>RLIMIT_RT_CPU_RATIO</tt>, later changed to <tt>RLIMIT_RT_CPU</tt>).
This limit controls what percentage of the processor's time may be taken by
all unprivileged realtime processes.  If the limit is in effect, the patch
also allows any process to enter the realtime scheduling classes.  So the
end result is similar to that obtained with Con's patch: unprivileged tasks
can get realtime access to the processor, but they are prevented from
taking over entirely.  The difference is that Ingo's patch is somewhat
smaller and simpler, and does not require the introduction of new
scheduling classes.

<p>

The rlimit-based patch is also interesting in that it allows each process
to have a different maximum CPU utilization limit.  Imagine a system
running a set of audio applications where some have their limit set at 60%,
and others at 80%.  If 70% of the available processor time is actually
being used by realtime tasks, processes with the 60% limit will lose their
realtime access, but the 80% processes will not.  This scheme, thus, allows
a smart supervisor (such as the <a
href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/">jack</a> server) to arrange for a
(relatively) graceful degradation as contention for the CPU increases.
<p>

Jack O'Quin's benchmarking suggests that either patch, in their most recent
forms, has the potential to solve the problem (though the realtime
preemption work may also be required for a complete solution).  He appears
to favor Ingo's version, however, and its relative simplicity could well
argue for taking that path.  It does not seem that any decisions have been
made, however; it may be that nothing is merged until the 2.6.12 process
starts.  It does appear, however, that life is about to get a little easier
for Linux audio users, which is a good thing.  It can be worthwhile to be
noisy about your needs, especially if you are willing to put time into
helping in the development of the solution.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

       Because you need to say what it is you want. If there isn't enough CPU <br>
to meet all requirements, someone needs to decide on a trade-off and  <br>
not all users will want the same things: should the RT apps remain  <br>
RT even if this makes all the non-RT ones completely unuseable? Surely <br>
the user should make that decision rather than the kernel? Or, as other <br>
people have more concisely put it, the kernel provides mechanism, not <br>
policy.  <br>

      It is rocket science; if his app exceeds 100% CPU usage, he's not getting what he wants, and there's nothing a better kernel can do about it. As exceeding 100% CPU is going to lock up his machine, the patch allows a musician to set a limit, and then <b>if</b> his realtime applications are going to lock his machine up, the kernel drops their realtimeness, thus giving a musician a chance of recovering. Without this mechanism, the machine can lock hard, and there's no way to discover why, or to recover.
<p>As a simple example of when this helps; a soft synth is normally a realtime application (MIDI in -> Waveform out). When running, a soft synth doesn't take that much CPU; if it did, it wouldn't work. If your algorithm fails, and causes the synth to run away in an endless loop (bad validation of input MIDI data, for example), you're doomed if it can take 100% CPU. If all your RT tasks are limited to 95% CPU between them, you can fire up "top", notice that the soft synth has gone from around 5% CPU to around 90% CPU, and kill it.

      Real time apps need realtime processing. They do not care if that takes 50% or 70% of the CPU. I think the isoschmiso classes are just teasing the apps in that they are promising them CPU bandwith but not realy guaranteeing that. I think a better approach would be to measure what are the needs of a realtime application and compute at application start time if a CPU bandwidth can be guaranteed for it and if not to exit right there with an error message or start NORMAL and notify the user of this.<br>

      There is no way for the kernel to accurately gauge the needs of a real-time application. Given a simple enough case, the developers of the application can determine what it needs, and require that users set the cap high enough, but in the general case, this is not possible.
<p>No matter what the kernel does, if you want more CPU power than is available, you're doomed; all the isosynchronous patches do is limit the available CPU power to less than flat-out, allowing an admin to recover if a realtime process runs away. The solution is the same as in any other realtime system; get a faster processor.

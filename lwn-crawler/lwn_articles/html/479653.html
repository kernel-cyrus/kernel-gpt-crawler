Anybody who does low-level kernel programming for long enough learns that
the hardware is not their friend.  Expecting the hardware to be nice is a
recipe for disaster; instead, one must treat the hardware as if it were a
clever and willful dog.  With some effort, it can be made to perform
impressive tricks, but, given a moment of inattention, it will snag your
dinner from the grill and hide under the couch.  The good news
is that Linux kernel developers understand the nature of their relationship
with the hardware and take great care not to trust it too far.  Or, at
least, that is what we would like to think.
<p>
Consider this snippet of code from <tt>drivers/char/hpet.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
	do {
		m = read_counter(&amp;hpet-&gt;hpet_mc);
		write_counter(t + m + hpetp-&gt;hp_delta, &amp;timer-&gt;hpet_compare);
	} while (i++, (m - start) &lt; count);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>read_counter()</tt> is a thin macro wrapper around
<tt>readl()</tt>.  The driver is writing to the timer compare register in a
loop, assuming that the "main counter" value read from the HPET will
eventually exceed the threshold value.  Almost always, that is exactly what
happens.  But if the HPET ever goes a little bit weird and stops returning
something meaningful when the main counter is read, the above code could
easily turn into an infinite loop.  The kernel is trusting the hardware to
be rational, but the hardware may not choose to live up to that
expectation.
<p>
"Usbmuxd" is a daemon which facilitates communications with various Apple
iDevices.  Recently, <a
href="http://git.marcansoft.com/?p=usbmuxd.git;a=commitdiff;h=f794991993af56a74795891b4ff9da506bc893e6">this
patch to usbmuxd</a> was recognized to be a security fix for a bug
eventually designated as CVE-2012-0065.  In short, this daemon would read a
serial 
number string from the device and copy it into an internal array without
checking its length.  Exploiting this vulnerability is not easy - it
requires the ability to plug in a USB device that has been designed to
overflow that particular buffer with something interesting.  But it
<i>is</i> a vulnerability, and it is worth noting that an increasing number
of USB devices are really just Linux systems using the "USB gadget" code;
creating that malicious device would not be hard to do.  So this
vulnerability could be interesting to the "leave a malicious USB stick in
the parking lot" school of attacker.
<p>
This bug, too, is the result of trusting the hardware.  As seen here, the
hardware could be overtly evil.  In other cases, it is just subject to
electrical wear, power spikes, cosmic rays, and the varying skills of those
who write the firmware - closed source which is never reviewed by anybody.
Even in a world where price pressures didn't mandate that each component
must cost as little as possible, hardware bugs would be a problem.

<p>
By now, the lesson
should be clear: driver developers should always regard their hardware with
extreme suspicion and take nothing for granted.  The problem is that even
highly diligent developers (and reviewers) can easily let this kind of
bug slip by.  In almost all cases, the driver appears to work just fine without the
extra sanity checks; the hardware plays along most of the time, after all,
until that especially inopportune moment arrives.  Sometimes the developer
sees the resulting failure, resulting in that "oh, yeah, I have to
make sure that the hardware doesn't flake there" moment that is discouragingly
common in driver development.  Other times, some far away user sees strange
problems and nobody really knows why.
<p>
What would be nice would a way for the computer to tell developers when
they are being overly trusting of the hardware; then it might be possible
to skip the "tracking down the weird problem" experience.  As it happens,
such a way exists in the form of a static analysis tool called <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kadav/carbdownload.php">Carburizer</a>,
developed by Asim Kadav, Matthew J. Renzelmann and Michael M. Swift.  Those
wanting a lot of information about this tool can find it in <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kadav/new2/pdfs/carb_poster.pdf">this
one-page poster [PDF]</a>, <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kadav/new2/pdfs/carb-sosp09.pdf">this ACM
Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) paper [PDF]</a>, or in <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kadav/new/carb/Site/Problem.html">this
rather over-the-top web site</a>.
<p>
In short: Carburizer analyzes kernel code, looking for insufficiently
robust dealings with the hardware.  Its key strength at the moment appears
to be the identification of possible infinite loops - loops whose exit
condition depends solely on a value obtained from the hardware.  There are,
it seems, 
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kadav/busy_waits-3.2.1.txt">over 1000
such loops</a> in the 3.2.1 kernel.  The tool also looks for cases where
unchecked values from hardware are used to index arrays or are used
directly as pointers, though the false-positive rate seems to be higher for
these checks.  The result is an output file as linked above, from which
developers can go and investigate.
<p>
Naturally enough, the tool shows some signs of its academic origins.  It is
written in Ocaml and requires some modifications to the kernel source tree before
it can be run.  Carburizer also requires that multi-file drivers be merged
into one big file, with the result that the line numbers in the resulting
diagnostics do not correspond to the source tree everybody else has.  That
may be part of why, despite a positive response to <a
href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-kernel-janitors/msg10472.html">a
posting of the tool</a> on kernel-janitors in January, 2011, little in the
way of actual fixes seems to have resulted.  Or it may just be that, so
far, these results have only been seen by a relatively small group of
developers. 
<p>
Interestingly, Carburizer can propose fixes of its own.  These include
putting time limits into potentially infinite loops and adding bounds
checks to suspect array references.  While it is at it, Carburizer fixes up
seemingly unnecessary <tt>panic()</tt> calls and adds logging code to
places where, it thinks, the driver neglects to report a hardware failure.
With a separate runtime module, it can even deal with stuck interrupts (the
driver is forced into a polling mode) and more.  The resulting code has not
been posted for consideration, which is not entirely surprising; the fixes
are, necessarily, of a highly conservative "don't break the driver"
nature.  Such fixes are almost certain not to be what a human would write
after looking at the code.  But the tool is open source, so interested
developers can run it themselves to see what it would do.
<p>
Meanwhile, even without automatic fixes, these results seem worthy of some
attention.  Computers can be far better than humans at finding many classes
of bugs; when computers have been used in that role, some types of bugs
have nearly disappeared from the kernel.  Maybe someday we'll have a
version of Carburizer that can be folded into a tool like checkpatch; for
now, though, we'll have to look at its complaints about our code separately
and decide what action is needed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm not the poster you're responding to, but I did also check out a report in my code.  It thinks this function in drivers/media/video/ov7670.c is an infinite loop:
<p>
<pre>
static int ov7670_write_array(struct v4l2_subdev *sd, struct regval_list *vals)
{
	while (vals-&gt;reg_num != 0xff || vals-&gt;value != 0xff) {
		int ret = ov7670_write(sd, vals-&gt;reg_num, vals-&gt;value);
		if (ret &lt; 0)
			return ret;
		vals++;
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
...but it's just reading through a static array, looking for the end marker.

Thanks for pointing that out Jon! The one you reported was an issue with our new i2c support - I just fixed them across all results. Most commonly,  false positive arise due to counters that we fail to detect though. There were about 8% false positives or so when we reported the results thoroughly for 2.6.18 kernel. There are still about 800+ bugs out there, and many of them occur in larger groups (although there are many one off bugs as well).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; ... but it's just reading through a static array, looking for the end marker. </font><br>
<p>
Looking for an end marker, which is not guaranteed to exist. At least not until you do inter function dependency analysis and have all potential callers' code and make sure there is no path your array data origins from some not to be trusted hardware or user input. Could be easy or impossible. <br>
<p>
Of course it would not be an endless loop, but still a potentially dangerous construct overreading the allocated array.<br>

      <blockquote><i>[O]ne must treat the hardware as if it were a clever and willful dog. With some effort, it can be made to perform impressive tricks, but, given a moment of inattention, it will snag your dinner from the grill and hide under the couch.</i></blockquote>
May I suggest this as the quote of the year?

A critical feature for any such tool is the ability to silence false positives and well known bugs with ease. I mean:<br>
<p>
/** @carburizer_shut_up_because_I_know_you_are_wrong_here */<br>
some_code_triggering_a_false_positive()<br>
<p>
/** @carburizer_shut_up_because_this_issue_cannot_be_fixed_yet_see_bug_4325 */<br>
dangerous_code()<br>
<p>
Of course it does not have to be inline comments, some external exclusion file could be even better.<br>
<p>
How does carburizer fare with respect to this?<br>

I'm looking forward to the new LWN CSS inspired by it!<br>

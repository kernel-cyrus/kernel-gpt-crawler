<p>Supporting network protocols at high speeds in pure software is getting
increasingly difficult, with 25-100Gb/s interfaces available now and
200-400Gb/s starting to show up.  Packet processing at 100Gb/s <a
href="/Articles/629155/">must happen in 200 cycles or less</a>, which does
not leave much room for processing at the operating-system
level. Fortunately some operations can be performed by hardware,
including checksum verification and offloading parts of the packet send and
receive paths.
<p>
As modern hardware adds more functionality, new options are
becoming available. The 5.3 kernel includes a patch set from Pablo Neira
Ayuso that <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190709205550.3160-1-pablo%40netfilter.org/">added
support</a> for offloading some packet filtering with <a
href="https://www.netfilter.org/">netfilter</a>. This patch 
set not only adds the offload support, but also performs a refactoring of
the existing offload paths in the generic code and the network card
drivers. More work came in the following kernel releases. This seems like a
good moment to review the recent advancements in offloading in the network
stack.</p>

<h4>Offloads in network cards</h4>

<p>Let us start with a refresh on the functionality provided by network
cards. A network packet passes through a number of hardware blocks before it
is handled by the kernel's network stack. It is first received by the
physical layer (PHY) processor that deals with the low-level aspects,
including the medium (copper or fiber for Ethernet),
frequencies, modulation, and so on. Then it is passed to the medium
access control (MAC) block, which copies the packet to system
memory, writes the packet descriptor into the receive queue, and possibly
raises 
an interrupt. This allows the device driver to start the processing in
the network stack.</p>

<p>MAC controllers, however, often include other logic, including specific
processors or FPGAs, that can perform tasks far beyond launching DMA
transfers. First, the MAC may be able to handle multiple receive queues that
allow separating packet processing onto different CPUs in the system. It
can also sort packets with the same source and destination
addresses and ports, called "flows" in this context; different
flows can be redirected to specific receive queues. This has
performance benefits, including better cache usage. More than that,
the MAC blocks can perform actions on flows, such as
redirecting them to another network interface (when there are multiple
interfaces in the same MAC), dropping packets in response to a denial-of-service
attack, and so on.</p>

<p>The hardware behind that functionality includes two blocks
that are important for netfilter offload: a parser and a classifier. The
parser extracts fields from packets at line speed; it
understands a number of network protocols, so that it can handle the packet
at multiple 
layers. It usually extracts both well-known fields (like addresses and
port numbers) and software-specified ones. In the second step
the classifier uses the information from the parser to perform
actions on the packet.</p>

<p>The hardware implementation of those blocks uses a structure called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory">ternary
content-addressable memory</a> (TCAM), a special type of
memory that uses three values (0, 1 and X) instead of the typical two
(0 and 1). The additional X value means "don't care" and, in a comparison
operation, it matches both
0 and&nbsp;1. A typical parser provides a number of TCAM entries, with each
entry associated with another region of memory containing actions to
perform. That implementation allows the creation of something like
regular expressions for packets; each packet is compared in hardware
with the available TCAM entries, yielding the index for any matching entries
with the actions to perform.</p>

<p>The number of TCAM entries is limited. For example, controllers in Marvell
SoCs like Armada 70xx and 80xx have a TCAM with 256 entries (covered
in a <a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osseu19/3d/chevallier-network-classification-offload.pdf">slide
set [PDF]</a> from Maxime Chevallier's talk about adding support for
classification offload to a network driver at the 2019 Embedded Linux
Conference Europe). In comparison, netfilter configurations often include
thousands of rules.

Clearly, one of the challenges of configuring a controller like this
is to limit the number of rules stored in TCAM. It is
also up to the driver to configure the device-specific actions and
different types of classifiers that might be available. The hardware
available is usually complex and the drivers usually support only a
subset of what is available.</p>

<p>Offload capabilities in MAC controllers can be more sophisticated than
that. They
include implementations of offloading for the complete TCP stack, called
TCP offload engines. Those are currently not supported by Linux, as
the code needed to handle them <a
href="/Articles/148697/">raised many objections years ago</a> 
from the network stack maintainers. Instead of supporting
TCP offloading, the Linux kernel provides support for specific, mostly stateless
offloads.</p>

<p>Interested readers can find the history of the offload development in a
<a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/lpc_net2018_talks/Brandeburg_networking_hardware_offloads.pdf">paper
[PDF]</a> from Jesse Brandeburg and Anjali Singhai Jain, presented at the
2018 Linux Plumbers Conference.</p>

<h4>Kernel subsystems with filtering offloads</h4>

<p>The core networking subsystem supports a long list of offloads to network
devices, including checksumming, scatter/gather processing, segmentation,
and more. Readers can view the lists of available and active offload
functionality on their machine with:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    ethtool --show-offload &lt;interface&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>The lists will be different from one interface to another,
depending on the features of the hardware and the associated driver.
<tt>ethtool</tt> also allows configuring those offloads; <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ethtool.8.html">the manual
page</a> describes of some of the available features.</p>

<p>The other subsystem making use of hardware offloads is traffic
control (tc with the configuration tool of the same name); the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html"><tt>tc</tt> manual
page</a> offers an overview of the available features, in particular the
flower classifier, which allows administrators to set up
scheduling of network packets. Practical examples of <tt>tc</tt> use include
bandwidth limiting per service or adding priorities to some traffic.
Interested readers can find more about tc flower offloads in
an <a
href="https://netdevconf.info/2.2/papers/horman-tcflower-talk.pdf">article
[PDF]</a> by Simon Horman presented at NetDev 2.2 in November 2017.</p>

<p>Up to this point, filtering offloads were possible with both <tt>tc</tt> and
<tt>ethtool</tt>; these two features were implemented
separately in the kernel. This duplication also required duplication of
work by authors of network card 
drivers, as each offload implementation used different driver
callbacks. With the advent of a third system adding offload functionality, the
developers started working on common paths; this required refactoring
some of the common code and changes in the callbacks to be implemented
by the drivers.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Network packet processing with high speed interfaces is not an easy
task &mdash; the number of CPU cycles available to do so is
small. Fortunately, the 
hardware is offering offload capabilities that the kernel can use to ease the
task. In this article we have provided an overview of how a network
card works and some offload basics. This is to lay the
foundations for the second part, where we're going to look into the
details of the changes brought by the netfilter offloading
functionality, both in the common code, and how it affects
driver authors ‚Äî and how to use the netfilter offloads, of course.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I had no idea ternary memory and logic was being used at that low level. Brings to mind the aborted attempts to actually run full ternary computers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer</a>) up into the 1970s.<br>
<p>
Surprised to see that logic used there (although the 1/0/NULL of SQL is another example of modern usage) -- I wonder if ternary silicon is an area of research for this hardware.<br>

In TCAM the third level is more like a wildcard for addressing.<br>

But there are many other silicon devices that use multiple levels, like MLC flash cells. After all, the world is analog.<br>

At least Wikipedia (the world's One True Single Source Of Truth, obviously) says it's typically implemented with a second bit rather than relatively exotic multi-level logic. That would have been my gut feeling as well, that designers would rather avoid complicating their design and process for saving what's essentially peanuts in transistor count.<br>
<p>
Also, this is SRAM. MLC flash works by storing different charge levels in the cell. The closest equivalent I can think of for SRAM would be different voltages - more or less impossible to achieve using a single supply, without first generating a second voltage from that. Which wastes chip area and power for no real gain, making the two-bit solution look even better in comparison.<br>

TCAM may be peanuts in a NIC with 256 entries, but not in a large switch/router. It's how switches manage to do route lookups in wirespeed; you have one entry (IIRC, typically 192 TCAM bits for matching, well, various stuff) per route, and then something like 512k routes. More in modern devices, now that the IPv4 routing table is larger than that‚Ä¶ so think 1M routes, 192 bits for each, so now you have 192M SRAM cells and comparators to run in parallel! And each line card has the same amount! So if you could somehow design those with exotic logic instead of two bits, it would be a win.<br>
<p>
Someone once described TCAM to me as ‚Äúthe stuff you upgrade in your router, and then the power bill goes up‚Äù.<br>

On second thought, maybe if you can implement TCAM with DRAM, you could get the X state by charging the capacitor a little less (shorter / via a higher resistance path). Then design the comparator such that it accepts both 0 and 1 if the other input is in this "middle band". If the refresh cycle is fast enough that a 1 won't decay into an X (or an X into a 0), then maybe this could work.<br>
<p>
But I'm sure people much smarter than me have tried to optimize TCAM for many years, and are already using ideas much better than I can think of, so I'll stop now.<br>

      <blockquote>
At least Wikipedia (the world's One True Single Source Of Truth, obviously) says it's typically implemented with a second bit rather than relatively exotic multi-level logic.

The TCAM used in network switches, routers etc. definitely works that way, storing the ternary values as two bits each. It is ternary in the same sense that BCD is decimal; both are encoded using only binary digits. A  TCAM cell is effectively much more than twice the size of a normal SRAM cell because it also contains the comparator logic. This is one reason why TCAM chips are orders of magnitude more expensive than an equivalent amount of SRAM.
<p>
It would be possible to build SRAM using multilevel cells, but most likely that would result in larger and slower memory than using binary.
<p>
On the other hand, two-bit-per-cell masked ROM technology exists. Each cell has transistors chosen from four transistor sizes resulting in four possible on-state resistances. Reading from it works the same way as MLC flash; the sense amplifier feeds analog comparators to distinguish the levels. The microcode of the original Intel 8087 numeric coprocessor was stored in

Those 200 cycles seem to be a very short timeframe to do something useful.  Can one implement a firewall, querying a database on some packets?  Using FPGAs??<br>
<p>
Except for routers, to be able to communicate faster than one can think sounds nonsensical.  Something like arriving before leaving...?<br>

remember that those 200 cycles are for processing header only, the length of payload doesn't matter (here it's averaged over typical frame sizes)<br>

it's just like navigation: handling a 20t truck in principle is not different than a 3.5t truck<br>

I think the 200 cycles number is just meant as a reminder that it's "not much" time per packet. The linked article seems to be talking about a single 3 GHz CPU. Obviously the available cycles vary with average packet length and CPU clock, and processing can be split over multiple cores. That is, of course, no reason not to try making the best use of the available cycles, since latency will suffer if you just rely on parallellism to stem the load.<br>

The 200 cycles number is really a ballpark figure and should not be taken for granite. A simple optimisation is to use mainly jumbo frames, which raises your per-packet budget to more than 1000 cycles.<br>
<p>
I also think that no OS achieves CPU-involved forwarding speeds of even 10Gbps without a lot of NIC offloading (coalescing, TSO, etc.)<br>

You can easily get more than 1 million packets per second on general CPUs without any offloading, this works out to more than 10GBps easily.<br>

TCAM is necessary for the most general filter matching, but somewhat more restricted packet filtering can be done using a hash table with open addressing.<br>

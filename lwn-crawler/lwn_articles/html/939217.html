The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/chmod.3p.html"><tt>fchmodat()</tt></a>
system call on Linux hides a little secret: it does not actually implement
all of the functionality that the man page claims (and that <a
href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/chmod.html">POSIX
calls for</a>).  As a result, C libraries have to do a bit of a complicated
workaround to provide the API that applications expect.  That situation
looks likely to change with the 6.6 kernel, though, as the result of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1689092120.git.legion@kernel.org/">this patch
series</a> posted by Alexey Gladkov.
<p>
The prototype for <tt>fchmodat()</tt> is defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    int fchmodat(int fd, const char *path, mode_t mode, int flag);
</pre>
<p>
Its purpose is to change the permissions of the file identified by
<tt>path</tt> to the given <tt>mode</tt>.  In the style of all the
<tt>*at()</tt> system calls, <tt>fd</tt> can be an open file descriptor
referring to a directory; if <tt>path</tt> is relative, the
lookup process will start at the directory indicated by <tt>fd</tt> rather
than the current working directory.  The
<tt>flag</tt> argument can be either zero or <tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt>.
<p>
Support for <tt>fchmodat()</tt> was added to the Linux kernel for the
2.6.16 release in 2006 as part of a series from Ulrich Drepper adding a
number of the <tt>*at()</tt> calls.  That version of <tt>fchmodat()</tt>,
though, did not include the <tt>flag</tt> argument, a situation that
continues to the present.  As a result, the
kernel's <tt>fchmodat()</tt> implementation is not compliant with the
specification, and is not what application developers will expect.  That,
in itself, is not entirely unusual; applications do not (usually) invoke
system calls directly.  Instead, they use wrappers in a low-level library,
usually the C&nbsp;library, which do what is needed to provide the expected
API.  That is what happens here, but the result is not ideal.
<p>
The POSIX specification defines the behavior of the
<tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt> flag as: "<q>If <tt>path</tt> names a symbolic
link, then the mode of the symbolic link is changed</q>".  That behavior
differs from the default, where the mode of the file <i>pointed to</i> by
that link will be changed instead.  There are two reasons why one might
want a flag like this: to actually change permissions on a symbolic link,
and, more importantly, to <i>prevent</i> the changing of permissions on a
real file by way of a symbolic link.  Attackers have been known to use
symbolic links to confuse a privileged program into changing file modes
that should not be changed; using this flag will prevent such an outcome.
<p>

If one looks at the (functionally
identical) <tt>fchmodat()</tt> implementations in <a
href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/fchmodat.c;h=17eca54051ee28ba1ec3f9aed170a62630959143;hb=a492b1e5ef7ab50c6fdd4e4e9879ea5569ab0a6c#l28">the
GNU C library</a> and <a
href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/stat/fchmodat.c?id=718f363bc2067b6487900eddc9180c84e7739f80#n28">musl
libc</a>, two things jump out: implementing <tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt> in
user space is inelegant at best and, due to limitations in Linux itself,
neither library is able to implement exactly what the specification says
(but they are able to provide the important part).
<p>
The C-library implementations start by opening the file indicated by the
<tt>fd</tt> and <tt>path</tt> arguments to <tt>fchmodat()</tt> as an
<tt>O_PATH</tt> file descriptor.  Such a descriptor allows metadata
operations, but cannot be used to read or write the file; thus, it does not
require read or write permission on the file to open.  That <tt>open()</tt>
call also uses the <tt>O_NOFOLLOW</tt> flag; if the path ends with a
symbolic link, that will cause the link itself to be opened, rather than
the file pointed to.
<p>
At this point, the C libraries do an <tt>fstatat64()</tt> call to determine
what kind of file has just been opened; if the new file descriptor turns
out to be a symbolic link, an <tt>EOPNOTSUPP</tt> failure status will be
returned to the caller.  The Linux kernel does not support changing the
permission bits on a symbolic link in general (those bits have no real
meaning anyway), so neither C-library implementation even tries.
<p>
If the target is <i>not</i> a symbolic link, the library could just issue a
normal <tt>fchmodat()</tt> call with the given parameters and no flag.
That, however, could open the door to a time-of-check-to-time-of-use
vulnerability, where an attacker would replace the file with a symbolic
link between the check and the mode change.  So, instead, the library must
change the mode bits on the file that it actually opened in the first step,
without using the path name again.  Unfortunately, the obvious way (using
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fchmod.3p.html"><tt>fchmod()</tt></a>)
won't work, because that system call cannot operate on <tt>O_PATH</tt> file
descriptors in many filesystems.  So, instead, the C library generates the
path for the open file descriptor under <tt>/proc/self/fd</tt>, then passes
that to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/chmod.3p.html"><tt>chmod()</tt></a>
to effect the mode change.
<p>
This sequence seems unlikely to be the most efficient way to prevent the
following of a symbolic link for an <tt>fchmodat()</tt> call.  It also will
fail to work in settings where <tt>/proc</tt> is not available.  A much
nicer solution would be to just implement the <tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt>
flag in the kernel, which already has the needed machinery to do so in an
atomic and efficient manner.
<p>
That is what Gladkov's patch series does: it creates a new
<tt>fchmodat2()</tt> system call that implements the
<tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt> flag.  Once this system call is available in
released kernels, the C-library implementations can use it for their
implementation of <tt>fchmodat()</tt>, bypassing the current workarounds.
The result should be a faster and more robust implementation.  Chances are
that change will happen soon; VFS maintainer Christian Brauner has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230711-befreien-unwiderruflich-c2265c61e514@brauner/">applied
the series</a> and routed it into linux-next, meaning that it should be
pushed during the 6.6 merge window.
<p>
Interestingly, this is not the first attempt to add an <tt>fchmodat2()</tt>
implementation; there were patches posted by <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200916002157.GO3265@brightrain.aerifal.cx/">Rich
Felker</a> in 2020 and <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/148830142269.7103.7429913851447595016.stgit@bahia/">Greg
Kurz</a> in 2017.  It is not entirely clear why the patches were not
accepted at that time; it may be simply because VFS patches have
occasionally tended to fall through the cracks over the years.  The
previous failure may be part of why Felker <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230725184443.GA20050@brightrain.aerifal.cx/">responded
rather negatively</a> to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/104971.1690300714@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">a
suggestion</a> from David Howells that, perhaps, it would be better to add
a new <tt>set_file_attrs()</tt> system call, with a number of new features,
rather than completing <tt>fchmodat()</tt>.  That suggestion has not gained
much support, so Gladkov's attempt appears to be the one that will actually
succeed; after 17&nbsp;years in the kernel, <tt>fchmodat()</tt> should finally
get in-kernel <tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt> support.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Reading through the earlier thread, it looks like there was some - not entirely positively presented, to be fair - issues with the 2020 submission that have been corrected here, like the lack of tests.  So it might’ve been tough to get over the hump before but there were also some issues.<br>

      The patch originally used the name fchmodat4, but <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20230711-demolieren-nilpferd-80ffe47563ad@brauner/">review requested</a>

<blockquote><pre>
s/fchmodat4/fchmodat2/

With very few exceptions we don't version by argument number but by
revision and we should stick to one scheme:

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
I personally prefer the former, partly perhaps because at some point long ago I was under the impression it was the more the common practice. But more recently I've gotten the impression that most developers are unfamiliar with the version by argument number (i.e. arity) pattern. Have I always been in the minority camp or did the world change around me?

Funnily, there's not much precedence either way.<br>
<p>
Most syscalls that end in a number are 16, 32 or 64, indicating their limits (eg sys_time32)<br>
<p>
There's wait/waitpid/wait3/wait4, but the arity matches the sequence number. Similarly for dup/dup2/dup3 and pipe/pipe2<br>
<p>
The less said about sys_vm86 the better ;-)<br>
<p>
There's signalfd4, eventfd2, epoll_create1, accept4 which look to be arity based.<br>
<p>
But then there's renameat2 which has 5 arguments. mlock2 which takes 3. preadv2 and pwritev2 which take 5. openat2 takes 4. faccessat2 takes 4. epoll_pwait2 takes 5.<br>
<p>
pselect6 is named for its arity, but that's because you can't normally have more than 6 arguments to a syscall. clone3 was preceded by a clone2 that we don't talk about.<br>
<p>
I think you could make an argument either way.<br>

There as a discussion a few years back when we did openat2(), clone3() and others that simple versioning is the default.<br>
In sheer numbers this scheme also wins iirc.<br>
<p>
There's also the possibility that a system call like bla4() is broken and you'd wanted to change a system call argument type but not the actual number of arguments. Then you'd not be able to call it bla5() and blat4.2() would be rather weird. Imho, the simple versioning is just more flexible and is nowadays the de facto standard anyway.<br>

I also had documentation for all of this but there was never enough time to send it actually but fwiw:<br>

I think dup2 was actually “dup to”, and no, numbering functions by argument number totally strikes me as unusual and odd when I come by it (e.g. in jq). It’s extremely rare at least in whatever relatively broad but mostly traditional FOSS sphres I’ve been seeing.<br>
<p>
It’s also inflexible (what if you change one argument type in a revision, or even lose one).<br>

Right, fully agreed there.<br>

I’m not too much of a fan of puns based on specific pronunciations of things, especially if they go unexplained, but it’s probably obvious to english speakers.<br>

I'm kind of neutral on puns. If they're not needed to make sense (and dup2/wait4 are examples of that), I don't mind. The Lemmings icon of a pair of paws to mean pause is unforgivable.<br>

But puns like that is part of "the Unix way". Go back to the early versions, and Unix is absolutely full of them.<br>
<p>
My favourite example is the mutt man page - mutts (dogs) collect mail hence the name, and "mutts don't have bugs, they have fleas ..."<br>

dup2() is a POSIX-ism, and it appears to be sequential since POSIX also specifies dup(). I would be surprised if Linux named dup2 and then got POSIX to adopt that name (I think dup2 is probably older than that), but I'm insufficiently familiar with the history here to categorically rule it out.<br>

dup2() was added in V7 Unix (released in 1979), so it predates both POSIX and Linux by about a decade.<br>

      <p>&gt; The Linux kernel does not support changing the permission bits on a symbolic link in general (those bits have no real meaning anyway), so neither C-library implementation even tries.</p>

<p>This is actually not quite true, at least not until <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230712-vfs-chmod-symlinks-v2-1-08cfb92b61dd@kernel.org/">Christian's patch to enforce this</a> is merged. The restriction on symlink modes was always done on a per-filesystem basis (which lead some filesystems to allowing it by accident -- procfs allows this for several symlinks and magic-links). In fact, several filesystems (btrfs, xfs, and ext4) all returned <tt>-EOPNOTSUPP</tt> but still modified the inode mode.</p>

<p>&gt; Unfortunately, the obvious way (using <tt>fchmod()</tt>) won't work, because that system call cannot operate on O_PATH file descriptors in many filesystems.  So, instead, the C library generates the path for the open file descriptor under <tt>/proc/self/fd</tt>, then passes that to <tt>chmod()</tt> to effect the mode change.</p>

<p>This restriction is done on the VFS level, it's not per-filesystem (<tt>fchmod()</tt> uses <tt>fdget()</tt> rather than <tt>fdget_raw()</tt> -- and this behaviour is intentional per the description of <tt>O_PATH</tt> in <tt>open(2)</tt>).</p>

<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230727.041348-imposing.uptake.velvet.nylon-712tDwzCAbCCoSGx@cyphar.com/">If <tt>fchmodat2()</tt> adds support for AT_EMPTY_PATH</a>, it would be possible to avoid even procfs nastiness when dealing with <tt>O_PATH</tt> file descriptors -- something which is necessary in plenty of cases where <tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt> is inadequate, such as when dealing with paths you need to resolve safely with <tt>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT</tt> or other <tt>openat2()</tt> flags). I'll send a patch for this...</p>

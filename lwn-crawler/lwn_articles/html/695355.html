<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 27, 2016</br>
           </div>
"Memory protection keys" (MPK) are an Intel processor feature that allows a
process to divide its address space into regions and apply additional access
restrictions to each region.  Support for this feature has been under
discussion for over a year; when <a href="/Articles/689395/">the proposed
system calls</a> were posted for final review, there did not seem to be any
further impediments to merging them for the 4.8 kernel.  Some last-minute
objections have changed that picture, though, demonstrating just how hard
it can be to get new APIs right.
<p>
Though support for this feature has been widely discussed, the kernel's
memory-management developers have, for the most part, not participated in
that discussion.  That changed in early July when Mel Gorman took a look
and didn't entirely like everything that he saw.
<p>
One interesting aspect of the MPK feature at the hardware level is that it
is almost entirely 
available to unprivileged processes.  User space can allocate the keys
(which are just small integer values) and change the restrictions associated
with each key without help from the kernel.  The only action that does
require kernel intervention is associating key values with pages in the
page-table entries; the <tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt> system call exists in the
patch set for that purpose.
Even though they are not strictly necessary, the MPK patches have defined
system calls for 
key allocation (<tt>pkey_alloc()</tt> and <tt>pkey_free()</tt>) for
manipulating the associated access restrictions (<tt>pkey_get()</tt> and
<tt>pkey_set()</tt>).
<p>
One of Mel's first <a href="/Articles/695470/">comments</a> was that these
system calls are better implemented in user space.  There is nothing that
requires the kernel to be involved, and bringing in the kernel adds
overhead to the MPK functionality.  While there is sympathy for that view,
there also seem to be good reasons for implementing this functionality in
the kernel.  Nothing else can ensure that the allocation interface is used
(avoiding clashes between different parts of the same program), and the
kernel has to track the access restrictions anyway so that they can be
properly saved and restored on context switches.
<p>
Part of Mel's objection is that the system calls for manipulating
protection keys acquire the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore.  This semaphore,
which lives in the process's <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure, is one of the
most heavily contended locks in the system.  It is required for many other
memory-management tasks, such as <tt>mmap()</tt> calls and the handling of
page faults.  Acquisition of <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is unavoidable for
<tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt>, since it must manipulate the process's page
tables, but it is less clear that it should be needed for the other system
calls.  
<p>
There would appear to be a couple of reasons behind the use of
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  One is to avoid races between <tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt>
and the other system calls; it would be less than ideal to be applying a
particular key to a process's pages while another thread is deallocating
that key entirely.  But the consensus seems to be that this kind of race
cannot be entirely defended against and, if an application wants to defeat
itself in this manner, there is little to be done.  Another reason for the
use of <tt>mmap_sem</tt> has to do with how the system calls are
implemented; more on that shortly.
<p>
Regardless of the reasons for its use, though, it is clear that taking
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> in the MPK system calls will increase contention for
an already-busy semaphore and slow down many memory-management functions.  Thus,
Mel said: "<q>Right now, I'm seeing a lot of cost and not much benefit
with this specific patch.</q>"
<p>
The performance issue matters because, in the end, MPK is a performance
feature.  Almost anything that can be done with MPK can also be done with
direct <tt>mprotect()</tt> calls on ranges of pages, but MPK can be vastly
faster — contrast changing a single access-control register with iterating
through a range of page-table entries and changing the protections on each
one.  If the kernel's MPK implementation slows things down, it defeats the
purpose of using the feature in the first place.  And given that the
application does 
not <i>have</i> to use most of the kernel's system calls, developers are free
to circumvent the kernel if they don't want to pay the performance cost.
<p>
Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/695474/">expressed</a> that concern, noting
that, if the kernel's implementation is slow, "<q>user-space might
legitimately use its own implementation for performance reasons and we'd
end up with twice the complexity and a largely unused piece of kernel
infrastructure</q>".  Avoiding this problem requires dropping the use of
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> but, he fears, that is not enough.  It may become
necessary to create a whole new infrastructure based on <a
href="/Articles/615809/">virtual system calls</a> to achieve adequate
performance.  Rather than do all of that optimization now, he suggested, it
might be better to avoid implementing allocation and management
functionality in the kernel at all until a clear need develops.
<p>
He had another concern, though, that touches on the core of how the MPK
feature is envisioned.   One of the reasons for protecting the kernel's
MPK-related data with <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is that data's presence in the
<tt>mm_struct</tt> structure.  But, 
Molnar said, it should be a per-thread item stored in the
<tt>task_struct</tt> structure instead.  There is a significant difference
between these two placements: all of the threads that make up a process
share a single <tt>mm_struct</tt>, but each has its own
<tt>task_struct</tt>.  With the current implementation, all threads will
share the same set of protection keys and, in particular, the same set of
access restrictions.
<p>
The key-allocation functionality will always have to be per-process, since
all threads share the same page tables and will, thus, see the same keys
applied to each page.  But the register containing the restrictions
associated with each key must be managed by the kernel at context-switch time
anyway, and thus it does not need to be the same for every thread.  That
leaves open the possibility of having threads running with different
restrictions for the same keys.  Molnar described <a
href="/Articles/695481/">one use case</a> for this capability: having one
writer thread that is able to change a range of shared memory, while all
other threads have read-only access instead.
<p>
This notion of per-thread restrictions was not envisioned in the original
design for MPK support in the kernel and, indeed, would have been precluded
by the current patch 
set.  Assuming that this mode is useful, that would have proved to be a
fundamental limitation in the kernel's MPK implementation.  Supporting it
will require rethinking the API, though; there are interesting questions to
resolve, including how to set the restrictions for all threads in a
process.  Needless to say, such rethinking is best done before the API is
set in stone.
<p>
The performance and functionality concerns make it clear that, contrary to
appearances, the MPK patch set 
is still not ready for merging into the mainline.  Getting system-call
interfaces right is never easy, and it has certainly proved not to be in
this case.  But, once the kernel provides an API, that API must be
supported indefinitely.  Delaying the MPK system-call interface is not
going to make anybody happy, but it is preferable to merging the wrong
interface.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

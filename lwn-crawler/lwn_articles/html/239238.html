<h1>An API for virtual I/O: virtio</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 11, 2007 by jake]

<div class="ArticleText">
<p> Linux has an abundance of virtualization choices, each with its own way
of dealing with I/O.  A recent set of kernel patches, submitted to the
kernel-virtualization mailing list by Rusty Russell, would allow different
virtualization implementations to share drivers by using a virtual I/O
interface called <i>virtio</i>.  There have been several public iterations
of the interface with the latest, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/240626/">draft IV</a>, narrowing in on what
appears to be an acceptable solution, at least with the virtualization
folks.  </p>

<p> There are always questions about adding yet another layer into the
kernel, but the advantages for virtio are numerous.  Russell outlines
several in one of his <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/241104/">posts</a>
to the kernel-virtualization list.  There is
some amount of urgency in devising a solution because several of the
virtualization projects are either working on or reworking their virtual
I/O.  If an established mechanism, that already provides working block and
network drivers existed, those projects, as well as any newcomers, would be
likely to use it.</p>

<p>Another key element is to try and prevent a major proliferation of
kernel drivers each handling slightly different virtual block I/O.
Trying to tune and maintain those drivers could become a
major headache, so virtio separates the guest Linux side of the driver
from the code that is specific to the hypervisor implementation. Each group
of developers can maintain the code on their side of the API without
changing the other, unless, of course, the virtio API itself needs to
change.  It is likely that <i>some</i> kind of virtual I/O will be adopted,
as the kernel developers are likely to be unwilling to merge new
drivers for each different virtualization mechanism that comes along; some
commonality is required.
</p>

<p> The basic abstraction used by virtio is a "buffer", which consists of a
<tt>struct scatterlist</tt> array.   The array
contains "out" entries describing data destined for the underlying hypervisor
driver, as well as "in" entries for that driver to store data to return to the
guest driver.  The order is fixed (out followed by in) and a count of each
is part of the buffer description, which allows the hypervisor driver to
determine what it has.
This buffer abstraction
encapsulates everything needed to communicate data to be written to or read
from the hypervisor driver and, eventually, the underlying device.
A guest driver, that uses the virtio interface, hands off buffers to the
hypervisor driver and awaits their completion.
</p>

<p>
At its core, the virtio API is a set of functions that are provided by the
hypervisor driver to be used by the guest:

<pre>
    struct virtqueue_ops {
        int (*add_buf)(struct virtqueue *vq,
                       struct scatterlist sg[],
                       unsigned int out_num,
                       unsigned int in_num,
                       void *data);

        void (*sync)(struct virtqueue *vq);

        void *(*get_buf)(struct virtqueue *vq, unsigned int *len);

        int (*detach_buf)(struct virtqueue *vq, void *data);

        bool (*restart)(struct virtqueue *vq);
    };
</pre>

This operations vector is initialized by the hypervisor and passed to the
guest driver using a <tt>probe()</tt> function.  The guest then 
sets up its data structures and registers with its kernel as a block
or network device driver.
</p>

<p>
The basic operation uses <tt>add_buf()</tt> to register one or more buffers with the
hypervisor driver.  That driver is kicked via the <tt>sync()</tt> call to
start processing the buffers.  Each <tt>struct virtqueue</tt> has a callback
associated with it which will be called when some buffers have completed.
The guest then calls the <tt>get_buf()</tt> function to retrieve completed
buffers.  To support polling, which is used by network drivers,
<tt>get_buf()</tt> can be called at any time, returning NULL if none have
completed. 
The guest driver can disable further callbacks, at any time, by returning
zero from the callback.  The <tt>restart()</tt> routine is then used to
re-enable them.  Finally, the <tt>detach_buf()</tt> call is used
during shutdown to cancel the operation indicated by the buffer and to
retrieve it from the hypervisor driver.
</p>

<p>
As part of his patches, Russell has working example block and network
drivers using the virtio interface.  Each uses the virtio API differently,
and the requirements of each kind of device has pushed the evolution of the
interface into its current form.  He has also posted an example of a
driver implementing virtio for his <a
href="http://lguest.ozlabs.org/">lguest</a> hypervisor. 
 </p>

<p>
The block driver uses a protocol that the buffer always has at least one
out and in element.  The first element passes the sector and type (read or
write) information to the hypervisor driver and the first in element
receives the status of the request.  For a write, there are additional out
elements, whereas for a read, there are additional in elements.  When the
I/O completes, the callback is invoked and the <tt>get_buf()</tt> calls
return the completed buffers.
</p>

<p>
The network driver uses separate virtqueues for sending and receiving
packets which
allows it to avoid any locking between the two.  Each side only uses half
of the scatterlist, out for sending and in for receiving.  One of the major
differences from "draft III" is combining the two types of buffers;
previously there were "inbufs" and "outbufs" and the operations vector had
calls for each type.  By noticing that they could be combined while still
supporting single direction buffers, Russell has halved the number of
operations that need to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Currently, a hypervisor that wants to provide virtio devices to its guests
must arrange to call the <tt>virtblock_probe()</tt> or
<tt>virtnet_probe()</tt> functions.  Any device discovery must be handled
by the hypervisor and the guest driver is linked to the
hypervisor driver at compile time.  Dynamic, mix and match,
hypervisor/guest combinations are not yet available, but will be down the
road;  proposals are already being floated on the kernel-virtualization list.
</p>

<p> 
In a blog <a
href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/tech/2007-05-21.html">posting</a>,
Russell describes the tension between performance and abstraction:
<div class="BigQuote">
 The danger is to come up with an abstraction so far removed from what's
 actually happening that performance sucks, there's more glue code than
 actual driver code and there are seemingly arbitrary correctness
 requirements. But being efficient for both network and block devices is
 also quite a trick. 
</div>
<p>
It remains to be seen if the performance can live up to the needs of the
various virtualization projects.  If it does, and the interface is abstract
enough to handle the kinds of virtual devices required, we should see some
kind of push to get it included in the kernel sometime soon.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 17, 2008</br>
           </div>
The virtual memory scalability improvement patch set overseen by Rik van
Riel has been under construction for well over a year; LWN <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/257541/">last looked at it</a> in November,
2007.  Since then, a number of new features have been added and the patch
set, as a whole, has gotten closer to the point where it can be considered
for mainline inclusion.  So another look would appear to be in order.
<p>

One of the core changes in this patch set remains the same: it still
separates the least-recently-used (LRU) lists for pages backed up by files
and those backed up by swap.  When memory gets tight, it is generally
preferable to evict page cache pages (those backed up by files) rather than
anonymous memory.  File-backed pages are less likely to need to be written
back to disk and they are more likely to be well laid-out on disk, making
it quicker to read them back in if necessary.  Current Linux kernels keep
both types of pages on the same LRU list, though, forcing the pageout code
to scan over (potentially large numbers of) pages which it is not
interested in evicting.  Rik's patch improves this situation by splitting
the LRU list in two, allowing the pageout code to only look at pages which
might actually be candidates for eviction.
<p>

There comes a point, though, where anonymous pages need to be reclaimed as
well.  The kernel will make an effort to pick the best pages to evict by
going for those which have not been recently referenced.  Doing that,
however, requires going through the entire list of anonymous pages,
clearing the "referenced" bit on each.  A large system can have many
millions of anonymous pages; iterating over the entire set can take a long
time.  And, as it turns out, it's not really necessary.
<p>

The VM scalability patch set now changes that behavior by simply keeping a
certain percentage of the system's anonymous pages on the inactive list -
the first place the system looks for pages to evict.  Those pages will
drift toward the front of the list over time, but will be returned to the
active list if they are used.  Essentially, this patch is applying a form
of the "referenced" test to a portion of anonymous memory - whether or not
anonymous pages are being evicted at the time - rather than trying to check
the referenced state of all anonymous pages when the kernel decides it
needs to reclaim some of them.
<p>

Another set of patches addresses a different situation: pages which cannot
be evicted at all.  These pages might have been locked into memory with a
system call like <tt>mlock()</tt>, be part of a locked SYSV shared memory
region, or be part of a RAM disk, for example.  They can be either page
cache or anonymous pages.  Either way, there is little point in having the
reclaim code scan them, since it will not be possible to evict them.  But,
of course, the current reclaim code does have to scan over these pages.
<p>

This unneeded scanning, as it turns out, can be a problem.  The extensive
<a href="/Articles/286485/">unevictable LRU document</a> included with the
patch claims:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	For example, a non-numal x86_64 platform with 128GB of main memory
	will have over 32 million 4k pages in a single zone.  When a large
	fraction of these pages are not evictable for any reason [see
	below], vmscan will spend a lot of time scanning the LRU lists
	looking for the small fraction of pages that are evictable.  This
	can result in a situation where all cpus are spending 100% of their
	time in vmscan for hours or days on end, with the system completely
	unresponsive.
</div>
<p>
Most of us are not currently working with systems of this size; one must
spend a fair amount of money to gain the benefits of this sort
of pathological behavior.  Still, it seems like something which is worth
fixing. 
<p>
The solution, of course, is yet another list.  When a page is determined to
be unevictable, that page will go onto the special, per-zone unevictable
list, after which the pageout code will simply not see it anymore.  As a
result of the variety of ways in which a page can become unevictable, the
kernel will not always know at mapping time whether a specific page can go
onto the unevictable list or not.  So the pageout code must keep an eye out
for those pages as it scans for reclaim candidates and shunt them over to
the unevictable list as they are found.  In relatively short order, the
locked-down pages will accumulate in this list, freeing the pageout code to
concentrate on pages it can actually do something about.

<p>
Many of the concerns which have been raised about this patch set over the
last year have been addressed.  A few remain, though.  Some of the new
features require new page flags; these flags are in extremely short supply,
so there is always pressure to find ways of implementing things which do
not allocate more of them.  There are a few too many configuration options
and associated <tt>#ifdef</tt> blocks.  And so on.  Addressing these may
take a while, but convincing everybody that these (rather fundamental) memory
management changes are beneficial under all circumstances may take rather
longer.  So, while this patch set is making progress, a 2.6.27 merge is
probably not in the cards.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

A system with 128GB of memory is completely within the reach of most businesses these days.  I
priced out a machine today with 32 CPU cores and 128GB of memory.  It was $51000 on the list
price.

I recently priced a 4-socket opteron box with 128G of ram at ~$25K. I ended up buying the
2-socket boxs which are limited to 'only' 64G

these aren't the $2-3k 1u pizzabox machines that companies like to buy in large numbers for
clusters, but if you have apps that don't cluster well (or have per-machine licensing) they
can still be a _very_ good deal.

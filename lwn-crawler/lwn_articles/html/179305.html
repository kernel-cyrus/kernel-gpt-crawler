Once upon a time, setting up a Linux system was a long and problematic
process, with no assurance that a given system would work without great
pain.  Most of those problems have been overcome for years, and, to a great
extent, a system can be expected to "just work" with Linux.  A few
problematic areas remain, however, and wireless networking is one of them.
Even when the available hardware is supported (often not the case), making
a wireless connection work in a fully-featured way can often be a
challenge.

A lot is happening in the wireless area, however.  To help things along, 
the folks at the Open Source Development Labs hosted a summit for
wireless networking developers on April&nbsp;6
and&nbsp;7 at OSDL headquarters in Portland.  This event brought
together a diverse mix of developers from around the world, many of whom
had never met before.  Its purpose - to chart a path forward for the
creation of a reasonable Linux wireless networking implementation -
appeared to have been largely achieved.
<p>
Your editor was fortunate enough to be able to attend this meeting.  The
following report is an attempt to summarize the conclusions from the summit
- it is not a set of detailed minutes, and your editor will engage in some
chronological reordering along the way.  Hopefully the result will provide
a sense for where things stand, and where they are likely to go in the near
future.
<p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>

As John Linville (the recently-named wireless networking maintainer) noted
in a conversation with your editor, early wireless adapters were marketed
as "wireless Ethernet," and Linux kernel developers treated them as a sort
of slow, unreliable, fiddly Ethernet adapters.  But wireless is not
Ethernet in any way - it is a completely different set of networking
standards with its own quirks, special features, and distinct needs.
Treating wireless as a form of Ethernet slowed support for those special
features, and, more importantly, impeded the development of any sort of
internal kernel support for wireless.  Each developer who set out to
write a driver for a wireless adapter ended up implementing everything from
the beginning.  So there was no general wireless API, no comprehensive
support of wireless features, and a great deal of divergence and
duplication of code between drivers.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/179324/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/wns-2006/JeanTourrilhes-sm.jpg" width=94 height=102
alt="[Jean Tourrilhes]" align="right" border=0></a>

In 1997, Jean Tourrilhes decided to do something about this situation.  The
result was WE-1 - the first version of the Linux wireless extensions.
There was still no 802.11 standard at the time, but the WE API enabled the
configuration and operation of wireless adapters with a single set of
tools.  Jean's wireless tools are still the core utilities for managing
wireless adapters, though the graphical interfaces are replacing the
wireless tools for most users.
<p>

Development of the wireless extensions continued, with WE-9 - supporting
the new 802.11 standard - being released in 1999.  WE-18, merged last year,
added support for WPA ("WiFi Protected Access").  The current revision,
WE-20, adds a new, netlink-based interface as a future replacement for the
current <tt>ioctl()</tt> API.
<p>

Though development continues, there appears to be a general, shared feeling
that the wireless extensions are heading toward the end of their useful
life.  A replacement API - which does not exist yet - would work with the
entire wireless networking stack, rather than being an interface directly
to the low-level drivers.  Regardless of how that plays out, however, the
wireless extensions are likely to be around for a long time to come.

<p>
<h3>The current status</h3>
<p>

The current effort to create a proper wireless stack for Linux started in
2004, when Jeff Garzik <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/87952/">announced</a> the creation of a
special wireless tree, initially seeded with the HostAP code.  The merging
of HostAP enabled support of some relatively current networking cards and
the use of a Linux system as a wireless access point.  The creation of this
tree did help to get things going, but HostAP has not turned out to be
everything that had been hoped for.  In particular, there is no support in
HostAP for cards which need software MAC ("softmac") implementations.  But
many contemporary cards rely upon the host software for many low-level
operations; these cards can not be supported by the wireless stack found in
the current (2.6.16) kernel.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/179328/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/wns-2006/JohnLinville-sm.jpg" width=125 height=94
alt="[John Linville]" border=0 align="left"></a>

The result is, as John Linville put it, a Linux wireless implementation
which supports "anything which is obsolete."  Some cards are supported,
some better than others.  Most noteworthy among current hardware is the set
of Intel IPW drivers, which, thanks to Intel, have very good support in the
kernel - but these adapters do not need softmac support.
<p>

What is lacking, at this point, is a small list of mildly desirable
features, including support for much widely-used hardware.  Ease of use is
also lacking - despite improvements in the graphical tools, configuring a
wireless connection can still be a painful procedure.  Perhaps the best
demonstration of these two problems was to be found at the summit itself,
where about 25% of the participants ended up using an Ethernet cable to
plug directly into the OSDL network.
<p>

Other problems include consistency (or the lack thereof) across hardware -
there are still a number of adapter-specific APIs in the kernel and in the
out-of-tree drivers.  The documentation of APIs is, well, nonexistent; a
complaint was heard that <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> does not describe how to
write a wireless driver.  There is no coordinated process for extending
APIs.  Quality of service support is not present - an issue we'll return to
shortly.  There are no driver test suites in general circulation.  And the
whole regulatory issue looms over the wireless networking arena, and is the
largest single cause of out-of-tree (or nonexistent) wireless drivers.
Many vendors simply do not feel that they can release programming
information or free drivers and remain compliant with regulatory regimes
worldwide.
<p>

Meanwhile, the upcoming 2.6.17 kernel will see some improvements in its
wireless support.  John merged one of the many softmac implementations out
there, on the theory that it was one of the most active projects and that
it would help to support driver development.  The bcm43xx (Broadcom)
driver, which uses softmac, was also merged, and there are a couple of
other softmac-based drivers under development.  Even so, the consensus
appears to be that softmac is not the way forward; that, instead, the
Devicescape stack is the real future of Linux wireless.

<p>
<h3>Devicescape</h3>
<p>

<a href="http://devicescape.com/">Devicescape</a> is a company which offers
a number of products and services around wireless networking.  In
developing it offerings, Devicescape created its own, Linux-based 802.11
stack with a number of nice features - including good softmac and WPA
support .  This stack was recently released under the GPL and has been
fixed up for the kernel by Jiri Benc.  It is regarded by many as
being the best of the available free stacks.
<p>

When Jeff Garzik maintained the wireless tree, he took a firm position
against moving to the Devicescape stack, stating instead that the in-kernel
code should be evolved toward the needed capabilities.  He appears to have
found himself in the minority, however, and John Linville seems poised to
merge this stack for a future kernel release.  He maintains a separate
development tree which includes Devicescape, and some drivers (notably
bcm43xx) have been ported to this stack.  Nobody at the summit was heard to
argue against merging Devicescape.
<p>

Devicescape hacker Simon Barber talked about this code for a bit,
and a separate breakout session addressed it as well.  This stack is a
large body of code.  The freely-released code available now includes the
802.11 stack, the "openap" access point code, and a link-layer bridging
module.  Work which will be released soon includes improvements to the
hostapd daemon (802.11g support, among other things; this code is being
merged now); bridging and VLAN integration, and various improvements to
Ethereal for wireless developers.  There is also "a complete home gateway
distribution" in the works.  There is the inevitable web portal being put
together to provide access to all this code.

<p>

Quite a bit of work is foreseen for the Devicescape stack.  It is composed,
internally, of a long list of handler functions which deal with frames
(both data packets and 802.11 management frames) on their way to and from
the adapter.  Future plans call for enabling loadable modules to plug in
their own handler functions.  More of the management code may also
eventually be moved out to user space.  To that end, some additional
management capabilities will be added to the <a
href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/hostapd/">hostapd</a> daemon, which handles
authentication and management tasks.  Merging hostapd with <a
href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/">wpa_supplicant</a>, which
handles the client side of the authentication process, is envisioned;
evidently a number of things become easier when the two functions are
merged into the same process.
<p>

There is also a great deal of complexity coming with the long list of
future 802.11 standards.  These standards will require support as they are
adopted. 
<p>

One interesting area of development has to do with quality of service
support.  802.11 defines four service levels: "voice," "video," "best
effort," and "background."  There is a priority range for each service
level, and the ranges overlap.  All voice packets will go out before any
background packets, but the rest of the levels will share the available
bandwidth.  With proper QoS support, a wireless user can carry on a
voice-over-IP conversation, stream video of the latest "breaking news"
celebrity sighting from CNN, grab a new kernel by FTP, and distribute
materials (best not to ask what) via Bittorrent.  Each activity can operate
at its own quality of service level, and all should get the best available
performance.
<p>

Some wireless network adapters  have quality of service support in the
form of four separate transmit queues.  If the host places each packet in
the appropriate queue, the adapter will divide the available bandwidth
between them in a way which respects each level's service quality.  The
problem is that the Linux networking stack only supports one transmit queue
per device.  This presents a problem when one of the four device-level
queues fills up.  There is no way to tell the kernel that no more
background packets can be queued, but there is still space for voice
packets, for example; the only thing the driver can do is to stop the queue
for all packets.
<p>

The Devicescape hackers have worked around this problem using the traffic
control mechanism built into the networking stack, which normally operates
at a level not seen by driver code.  By creating a separate internal queue
for each service level, the Devicescape stack can, for all practical
purposes, implement a separate transmit queue for each service level.  Even
better, it becomes possible to configure policy - which types of traffic
get which service level - from user space using the normal traffic control
tools.  What would be nice, however, would be to generalize this use of the
queueing discipline code, and to make it available for other sorts of
hardware as well.

<p>
Another area requiring work is user-space API definition.  There is no
well-understood API which, for example, can be used by a graphical wireless
management utility to talk with the networking stack and with processes like
hostapd.  There isn't really even a discussion of how such an API should
look at the moment.
<p>

Other open issues include the usual regulatory hassles, the lack of a
user-space MAC-layer management environment, the need for better scanning,
support for adapters which perform MAC management in hardware,
power management support, and a rework of the configuration interface.
Configuration is handled by way of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls and a
<tt>/proc</tt> interface.  It was noted, in a pointed manner, that the
Devicescape code will not make it into the mainline as long as it contains
<tt>/proc</tt> files.  It seems that the Devicescape stack also needs some
work before it will operate properly on SMP systems.
<p>

Finally, adding proper wireless support to the kernel will involve the
creation of a specific <tt>net_device</tt> type for 802.11 devices.  An
802.11-specific <tt>sk_buff</tt> structure should also be defined.  Current
code still uses the Ethernet types and drags along the extra needed
information on the side.
<p>

The biggest open issue, however, may be this: what happens to the
just-merged softmac code when Devicescape is merged?  There is much
duplication of functionality there, and nobody is thrilled by the idea of
having to maintain two separate 802.11 stacks indefinitely into the
future.  There is a clear parallel with the OSS and ALSA sound drivers;
ALSA was supposed to replace OSS, but removing the OSS drivers has proved
to be a difficult thing to do.  It is not clear what can be done to make
removing softmac any easier.

<p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>

The summit was mostly attended by kernel-oriented developers, but there was
also some discussion of user-space tools;  <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a>
hacker Daniel Williams was present. It is recognized by all that,
while the quality of the available tools has improved significantly in the
last couple of years, there is some ground to cover yet.  In particular,
configuring an interface can be relatively painless when things go well,
but, as soon as something doesn't quite work, the whole experience falls
apart.
<p>
Improving the situation will require support from the kernel side.  When
things go wrong, user space needs to know just what the problem is.  But
there is no consistent set of error codes returned by the kernel to
indicate, for example, that the required adapter firmware is not present,
or the provided WEP key is not valid.  Some drivers support more of the
current API than others, which does not help, and API documentation is
generally not available.  Better scanning support would also be useful.

<p>
<h3>Hardware support</h3>
<p>
While getting the networking stack and user-space tools into shape is
necessary, improving hardware support is also a necessary step toward a
Linux wireless implementation which truly "just works."  Some hardware
(Intel, others) is well supported now, others (Broadcom) will be supported
soon.  Some, such as the Atheros chipset, may be a long time in coming.
The existing Atheros driver (as found in OpenBSD) appears to be severely
tainted by code of questionable origin, to the point that its chances of
being merged into Linux are about zero.  There is an effort to
document the Atheros hardware from the currently-available code, enabling a
clean-room driver implementation in the future, but there is quite a bit of
work yet to be done.
<p>

The regulatory compliance issue came up again in this context.  Some
adapters (such as Atheros) are, for all practical purposes, general-purpose
radios which can be programmed to operate far out of the 802.11
specification.  When a free driver is developed for such hardware, it would
be a Good Thing to be sure that it runs the hardware in a manner compliant
with the applicable regulations, even if it cannot necessarily be certified
as such.  That sort of testing requires specialized equipment, however, and
is evidently a multi-day process.  The necessary equipment does exist at
companies like Nokia and at some universities, but there is currently no
process for obtaining access to that equipment for compliance testing.
<p>

Much of the current driver work is done outside of the mainline tree, and
the kernel developers would like to see that changed.  Once code gets into
the mainline, it is easier for others to review and improve.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman encouraged driver developers to merge their code as early as
possible, even if it doesn't work yet.
<p>
Communications regarding wireless drivers, it was agreed, would remain on
the netdev mailing list for now.  If, at some point, that conversation
threatens to overwhelm other traffic on netdev, a new list can be created.
There will also likely be a web set put together for wireless driver
information in the near future.
<p>




<h3>Other issues</h3>
<p>
One purpose behind the summit was simply to try to pull more of the
relevant developers into the wider kernel process.  To that end, there was
a talk on source control systems - git and quilt in particular.  The "merge
early" approach was advocated many times.
<p>

Stephen Hemminger gave a talk on the state of the bridging code.
Bridging is of interest to wireless developers - it can be used for
connection sharing and mesh networking applications.  To that end, the
bridging code is likely to be reworked and much of it moved to user space.
Just like routing is mostly handled by user-space daemons now, bridging
management - including the spanning tree maintenance - will move to user
space in the future.

<p>
Some representatives of the <a href="http://www.personaltelco.net">Personal
Telco Project</a> were brave enough to compete with a delivery of pizza for
the developers' attention at lunch time.  These folks have put together a
network of over 100 Linux-based free wireless hotspots around Portland.
They had a number of requests of the kernel developers, including
free Atheros drivers which don't crash the system and good,
zero-configuration mesh networking.  This is an interesting project which
shows the power of what a few "unemployed geeks" can do.
<p>

Overall, the wireless summit was an optimistic event.  While the
shortcomings of Linux wireless support were well recognized and understood,
there was also a clear sense that not only could the problems be solved,
but that many of the solutions were already well advanced.  If all goes
according to plan, the day when Linux wireless "just works" is not that far
off.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      We would really rather receive typo reports as mail to lwn@lwn.net.  Most other readers probably have little interest in them.
<p>
That said, standard English rules call for trailing commas to be put inside quoted strings, so that's how I do it.

      Continuing the off-topic meta-discussion:
<p>
You incorrectly think that there was a British standard that Webster decided to deviate from.  In the 18th century, spelling was a free-for-all; even highly educated English-speaking writers on both sides of the Atlantic didn't even follow consistent spelling for the same word in the same document.  There was no standard, and the two great standardizers (Webster in the US, Johnson in Britain) made different decisions.  
<p>
Furthermore, many "Americanisms" represent an older British use, for example, the American pronounciation of "schedule".
And the British OED blesses "-ize" in most cases over "-ise", even for British English (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/words/quick/queries/iseize.html">Canadian reference picked for neutrality</a>), for words of Latin/Greek origin, though modern Brits put "-ise" everywhere as a reaction against the Americans, even though, as the OED shows, they didn't do so in times past.
<p>
In this particular case, I do think that the British approach to punctuation in quotes is more logical.

      I believe the convention for including punctuation within quotations was more of an acquiescence to typographical necessity rather than a grammatical choice. Apparently in old mechanical fixed type it was more aethetically pleasing to put punctuation before closing quotes.<br>
<p>
In the age of modern typography it seems obvious to me that logical quoting should be accepted as the new standard.<br>

I don't think it has anything to do with old mechanical fixed type, and as the comment says a few words later, it was about aesthetics, not necessity.
<p>
Even in a modern newspaper or Word document, the comma looks nicer inside the quotes, unless you're a mathematician and the extreme illogicalness of it hurts your eyes.
<p>
Incidentally, for those seeing this rule for the first time:  It applies to all punctuation, not just commas.  And there's a similar rule of American typography that says when entire sentences are in parentheses, the period for the last one goes <em>after</em> the closing parenthesis.

<P>
Not true.  From Warriner's:  <I>Colons and semicolons are always placed outside the closing quotation marks</I> (section 21g(2) of Fourth Course, at least in my edition).  Also:  <I>Question marks and exclamation points are placed inside the closing quotation marks if the quotation is a question or exclamation.  Otherwise they are placed outside</I> (section 21g (3)).  Turabian concurs (section 5.17 of Fifth Edition).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#004488"><I>And there's a similar rule of American typography that says when entire sentences are in parentheses, the period for the last one goes after the closing parenthesis.</I></FONT>

<P>
I question that as well; Warriner's discourages such usage in the first place but does say, <I>Put punctuation marks within the parentheses when they belong to the parenthetical matter</I> (section 22o).  Turabian doesn't seem to address the issue, although I may simply have missed it.

<P>

      And even putting the last comma in the list outside of the quotes is a peculiarly Oxford variant of English; it's even called "the Oxford comma". For the rest of us, they're optional. (Oxford English has another feature in common with American English - a preference for -ize endings over -ise endings.)<br>

      I think it should be noted that one the guys behind the Devicescape stack (and the one who published the code on netdev) is Jouni Malinen, of the HostAP/hostapd/wpa_supplicant fame.<br>

      Just a note to say thanks for this article - I don't know any other site that would tackle a fairly technical subject like the status of Linux wireless networking and do it in so complete and informative a manner.  This was hugely educational for me, and made me glad to be a subscriber.  Kudos, and hopefully you'll find time to put together more like this one.<br>

      Uh, it is maintained.  By its users.  If you see something incorrect, please make an effort to let us know.<br>

I created that site as a wiki, because no one person can keep up with a list of what doesn't work (or what does, for that matter).<br>

      You realise that there are probably half a dozen such lists out there? That said, one of the points of the conference was to set up a new linux wireless site that collects information, so watch for announcements.<br>
<p>
Also, having a negative list is imo stupid. You'll never know about all devices out there, so having a positive list is much more useful.<br>

      Exactly the opposite. In 1995 it made sense to have a list of hardware that worked. The rule now is that a given piece of hardware will work unless there's something strange or non-standard about it. Leenooks.com is a good idea, especially the fact that it's a wiki.<br>

      Wireless _Ethernet_ is the whole point of the exercise. To complain that down in the engine room these devices aren't actually 100Mbit Ethernet controllers with a UTP PHY is to completely miss the point of Ethernet and its success.<br>
<p>
A huge number of protocols, and protocol implementations have been written to run on top of an Ethernet link layer, some of them very tightly bound to Ethernet's specific features (e.g ARP). If you invent something quite different, let's call it Tenrehte, for your wireless networking, then none of that stuff works. No TCP/IP, no custom homebrew network code, nothing. So once you've started to ship engineering samples you need to go through a multi-month process to standardise layering of old protocols onto your new link layer. You need an IETF IP-over-Tenrehte working group, it produces specifications, a few people implement them, the specifications become standards track documents, updated software trickles out to end users and all the while you're doing this, a Wireless Ethernet product could be on shelves as a more or less drop-in replacement for wired products.<br>
<p>
We can follow Tenrehte's story for real with IRDA and Bluetooth on the desktop (notice how it took a long time for Linux to support anything better than a serial link with these link layers?) or with ATM on bigger networks. It's less painful to convert newer protocols like IPv6 (no ARP, so the interface to the link layer is simpler), but it's still months of extra work, so it must only be done if it's really necessary to have a new link layer.<br>
<p>
This is the same phenomenon as with PCI. Yes, PCI-X and PCIe aren't actually PCI hardware, the electrical connections are different, the speed is different, and down in the engine room of the kernel, there are different register settings, different hotplug behaviour, maybe different signalling and interrupt rules etc. But for most of the software outside that "engine room" these are just faster, better PCI devices. Or think of the Linux SCSI subsystem. A SATA disk isn't really a SCSI device, no conceivable electrical adaptor would make it plug into my UW SCSI controller, but for very good reasons Linux treats my SATA disks as SCSI devices and the SATA drivers in Linux do the extra work to accomodate this.<br>
<p>
So, Wireless Ethernet is called so for a good reason even if it's a lot easier to write a Linux kernel driver for an NE2000 than for the IPW2200. The only NE2000 I have uses 10base2 anyway, so it won't even plug into today's "real" Ethernet networks, because those use 100baseT or better.<br>

      Regarding GPL'd Devicescape code:
<blockquote>
There is the inevitable web portal being put together to provide access to all this code.
</blockquote>

If the portal isn't online yet, is there some other place where the GPL'd Devicescape code can currently be obtained?  In particular, I'm having some trouble using the standard hostapd release with a current development snapshot of the Devicescape-based Ralink driver (rt2x00), and it would be helpful if I could find the actual Devicescape version of hostapd.

      There's an FTP site, but what you probably really want is <a href="http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-dev.git;a=tree">the wireless-dev tree</a>, which has this code and at least one driver (the bcm43xx code) ported to it.

      Thanks.  Actually I do want some of the user-space code that isn't in the kernel repository, so I've been looking for an ftp site, but I haven't found it.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 12, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/755919/">bpfilter</a> subsystem, along with its
"user-mode blobs" infrastructure, attracted a lot of attention when it was
merged for the 4.18 kernel in 2018.  Since then, however, development in
this effort has been, to put it charitably, subdued.  Now, two years after
its merging, bpfilter may be in danger of being removed from the kernel as
a failed experiment.
<p>
<h4>Some history</h4>
<p>
Bpfilter is yet another in-kernel packet-filtering system; like netfilter
and nftables, it exists for the creation of firewalls and related
infrastructure.  Rather than try to provide all of the filtering primitives
that a user might want, bpfilter simply allows the loading of BPF programs
to inspect and accept (or reject) packets.
In theory, the benefits of bpfilter could be huge.  It
replaces a lot of firewalling code in the kernel, has the potential to be
significantly faster than either of the other two mechanisms, and should be
more flexible as well.  It is not unreasonable to expect that something
like bpfilter could eventually displace the other firewall subsystems and
become the standard solution on Linux systems.
<p>
For that to happen, though, the bpfilter developers would still have to do a lot
more work.  Beyond filling out the filtering functionality itself,
they would need  to find a
way to avoid breaking the untold millions of systems out there that are
currently using netfilter.  Administrators of those systems have a lot of
time invested in the creation of their firewall configurations and would
not take kindly to the idea that they have to learn BPF and start over.
Without seamless compatibility, bpfilter cannot take netfilter's place.
<p>
The solution that the bpfilter developers chose was to reimplement the
netfilter user-space API, so that the existing tools and configurations
would continue to work.  Internally to the kernel, though, netfilter rules
would be 
translated into BPF programs, which would then be attached in the
appropriate places.  That solution should provide the best of all worlds: a
shiny new packet-filtering subsystem with no changes required of users.
<p>
The only problem with this idea is that compiling netfilter rules to BPF is
not a small job; it would be a large chunk of code running in the kernel
that would have to be prepared for any kind of weirdness that user space
might present to it.  The memory footprint of that code would not be
welcome, and making sure that it was secure would be a difficult task that
would likely end up generating a fair number of CVE entries before it was
done.
<p>
To avoid this problem, the "user-mode blob" concept was invented.
Developers also often call it a "user-mode helper" even though that term
has been used for many years in the kernel for a program that is run in
user space at the kernel's request; this article will mirror that usage.  A
user-mode helper in this context is an executable 
program that is built into the kernel; when needed, it is run as a
separate, user-space process that communicates with the kernel via pipes.
For the translation of netfilter rules, this helper could read the rules provided by
user space, do the translation in a setting where memory can be paged out
and most bugs would not be
exploitable, then write the result back to the kernel.
<p>
When they were merged, bpfilter and user-mode helpers seemed like features that would
have far-ranging effects.  Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/Articles/749117/">called</a> user-mode helpers "<q>a very generic,
new, user/kernel api that a whole bunch of people are going to want to
use</q>", and some speculated that the Linux kernel was finally heading
in the direction of a microkernel architecture.
<p>
<h4>...and then?</h4>
<p>
After the code was merged, though, things got quiet.  Bpfilter has not seen any
development work of note, and nothing in the kernel is actually making use
of user-mode helpers.  When a recent bug report failed to get a response from
any of the developers of this code, Eric Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/875zc4c86z.fsf_-_@x220.int.ebiederm.org/">looked a
little deeper</a> and didn't like what he saw:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There have been no replies from the people who I expect would be
	maintainers of the code.  When I look at the history of the code
	all it appears to have received since it was merged was trivial
	maintenance updates.  There has been no apparent work to finish
	fleshing out the code to do what it is was aimed to do.
</div>
<p>
He pointed out a number of perceived bugs in the code, and suggested that
the most straightforward way to fix those bugs would be to just remove
bpfilter and user-mode helpers.
<p>
Proposing to remove somebody's code from the kernel is usually an effective
way of getting their attention; it worked this time.  Alexei Starovoitov
was quick to <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200606201956.rvfanoqkevjcptfl@ast-mbp/">turn
up</a> to block the change.  Linus Torvalds also <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wi=rpNZMeubhq2un3rCMAiOL8A+FZpdPnwFLEY09XGgAQ@mail.gmail.com/">showed
up</a>, pointing out that the code is, in fact, not used, and questioning
the idea of the user-mode helpers in the first place:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If people really convert netfilter rules to bpf, they'll likely do
	so in user space. This bpfilter thing hasn't gone anywhere, and it
	_has_ caused problems.
<p>
	So Alexei, I think the burden of proof is not on Eric, but on you.
</div>
<p>
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200607014935.vhd3scr4qmawq7no@ast-mbp/">responded</a>
that the bpfilter effort has taken longer than expected; it was hampered by
limitations in BPF that restricted the size of the rule sets that could be
implemented.  Those limitations are just now being overcome; the "BPF
iterator" functionality (described in <a href="/Articles/818714/">this
article</a>) that was merged for 5.8 is an important part of that;
"<q>soon bpf will be able to handle millions of rules</q>".  He later
<a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200608162027.iyaqtnhrjtp3vos5@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">added</a>
that he was not opposed to the removal of the bpfilter functionality for
now; it can always be restored if and when progress is made in that area —
something he said was not likely to happen for at least six months.
<p>
But, he continued, the user-mode helpers feature is important and needs to
stay in the kernel.  Beyond the bpfilter use case, he mentioned a couple of
others.  One of those was described as an extension of <tt>/proc</tt>; in
essence, it is using the BPF iterator mechanism to create new,
<tt>/proc</tt>-like files at run time.  Another is a form of initramfs that
was built into the kernel and would set up various subsystems early in the
boot process.  Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200608164045.GC425601@kroah.com/">said</a> that
using user-mode helpers to implement 
USB drivers in user space is on his "<q>TODO for this year</q>", but
made no promises as to when he might actually do that work.
<p>
Part of the problem with the user-mode helper concept is that there is no
example of its use at the moment.  Since nobody is using it,
bugs are not found, the code does not improve, and other developers have no
example to work from.  If some interesting functionality were to be
implemented using user-mode helpers, the situation might change.  If no
such functionality shows up, instead, it might be a strong indication that
this feature is not as useful as it seems.
<p>
The discussion came to no conclusion on the question of whether this code
should be removed or not. Experience shows that it is rare for
code to be removed when there is a developer actively arguing for its
retention.  Even that will not keep unused code around indefinitely,
though; unless some actual work is done on this code, it will eventually go
away as an experiment that did not lead anywhere useful.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is core kernel functionality that is not self-contained as a module that does not affect any other part of the kernel.<br>
<p>
So no, it is not viable for staging.  Also remember that staging is not a dumping ground for things that no one uses.  It can be used to merge things _out_ of the kernel if it is unused, but that only lasts for a kernel release or two.<br>

I have a sincere question: who was bpfilter *for*?<br>
<p>
And I can't answer that myself because web searches for it only turn up announcements and articles from the 4.18 era declaring it the best thing since sliced cputime. I can't find any details, tools or documentation for it — not online and not in the kernel tree either. It smells like a “job security” thing to me.<br>

It's for "much faster iptables": the eventual idea was that iptables could be hardware-offloaded and all sorts of stuff. The original LWN article on this had a bunch of use cases, but in effect the idea was that rather than iptables being interpreted, when implemented as bpf it would get JITted and suddenly you have packet filter rules at native code speed.<br>

<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
Eric Sandeen led a filesystem-track session at 
the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> on completing the
conversion of the existing kernel filesystems to use the <a
href="/Articles/759499/">mount API</a> that was <a
href="/Articles/787963/">added for the 5.2 kernel</a> in 2019.  That API is
invariably called the "new" API, which it <i>is</i> when compared to the
venerable <a 
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt></a>
system call, but it has been available for five years or so at this point
without really pushing its predecessor aside.  Sandeen wanted to discuss
the status of the conversion process and some other questions surrounding
the new API.
</p>

<p>
He began by saying the session
is "not really a rocket-science talk", instead it was more of a
"let's get that thing that we said we were going to do, done" talk.  The
original idea was to finish the conversion to the new API, then deprecate
and remove the internal API that is used by the old mount API. But, after an initial push,
there were few 
conversions until the pace picked up somewhat during the last two releases.
</p>

<p>
Of the 56 or so kernel filesystems, around 30 still remain to be converted,
Sandeen said, so he has been joking that the completion of the effort will
be in 2026.  A bunch of filesystem support had just been merged during the
6.10 merge windowâ€”which happened during the conference. The two
most prominent filesystems that still need to be converted are fat, which
has patches floating around the list, and bcachefs, which he looked at
briefly but did not tackle.
</p>

<p>
He encouraged the maintainers of any of the filesystems that still need
conversion to "go for it"; the maintainers should have a better idea what
mount support and options are needed for users.  But, he noted, some of the
kernel filesystems
are abandoned.  There may not be user-space tools or even a filesystem
image to work with, he said, so whoever takes on the task of converting those is
just going to have to do their best.
</p>

<h4>Logging</h4>

<p>
Another part of the API that he wanted to talk about was the message logging
that filesystems can use to communicate warnings and errors during the
mount process to user space.  There are three functions (<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.6/source/include/linux/fs_context.h#L189"><tt>infof()</tt>,
<tt>warnf()</tt>, and <tt>errorf()</tt></a>) that allow returning text strings
to the callers of the API.  When he started looking at converting
filesystems, he first thought that <tt>printk()</tt> calls should be
changed to use those logging functions, but has changed his mind because
there are "different audiences" for those messages.
</p>

</a>

<p>
He asked David Howells, who developed the new mount API, to describe the
original intent for the logging functionality.  Howells said that there
were two main purposes; first it provides a channel to report what went
wrong during a mount operation, which is especially useful when the user-space process cannot
access <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html"><tt>dmesg</tt></a>. It
also provides a way for filesystems to
ask questions, such as for passwords. 
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein said that there is more to it than just access to the
<tt>dmesg</tt> log, because there is no way to know if the user-space
tools will actually print any messages logged using the new API.  Christian
Brauner said that the <a
href="https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux">util-linux tools</a> have
added support for these messages, but Goldstein pointed out that the kernel
still has no way to know that the user will see them.  Brauner agreed that
they should still be sent to <tt>dmesg</tt>, but he also noted that
information sent to the kernel logs can become part of the user-space API of
the kernel, so there is a need for caution.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that part of the problem is that random user-space
programs are scraping the <tt>dmesg</tt> information via the log files or
perhaps the serial console.  If the information that gets sent to
<tt>dmesg</tt> changes, "there may be some random system-administration
script that gets cranky".  Those tools are arguably wrong to do so, he
said, but users will complain to the filesystem developers if it happens.
</p>

<p>
The mount API puts log messages into a <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.6/source/include/linux/fs_context.h#L169"><tt>struct
fc_log</tt></a> context, Brauner said. User space can then read the data
that gets logged by using the file descriptor returned from an <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.6/source/fs/fsopen.c#L115"><tt>fsopen()</tt></a>
system call.  Currently, just the errors (or maybe errors and warnings, no
one seemed to be sure) from that stream are written to <tt>dmesg</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Sandeen said that whatever is going to <tt>dmesg</tt> today should continue
to go there, in order to avoid complaints.  Another reason not to change
existing behavior, Brauner said, is that systemd uses a known-bad mount
option to probe the kernel to see how it can find out about illegal
options; to a monitoring tool, those could look like a continuing stream of
errors to be reported.  Similarly, Goldstein said that overlayfs has a lot
of different fallbacks that it tries that could be misinterpreted if they
are handled differently.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o suggested that the conversation get more concrete.  He wanted to try
to define the log level that would be used for invalid mount options in
<tt>dmesg</tt>, rather than try to guess whether programs will complain or
get confused.  "When we say 'we can't log to <tt>dmesg</tt>', that may not
be true" because it depends on the log level of the message.  Existing
practice will have to be accommodated, but filesystem developers need to
define the goal for these messages.
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner said that existing filesystems already have their own
mechanisms for reporting things like invalid mount options, which cannot
really change, so he suggested not changing what is sent to <tt>dmesg</tt>
at all.  User-space programs already need to access that information and
can continue to do so.  Goldstein said that overlayfs had no mechanism of
its own, so it uses <tt>dmesg</tt> to report problems; now there is a better
way to do that reporting, however there is no way to know if user
space will actually print those messages so that users can find them.
Brauner said that the lack of documentation has hampered the adoption of
the mount logging that came with the new API; since developers do not know
about it and cannot find out much about it, there is no real discussion or
agreement on how to use it.
</p>

<p>
Steve French noted that he had experienced similar problems in the early
2000s when he was working on SMB; "I needed to be able to tell user space
things and all I had were like ten return codes that were valid".  There
were thousands of different things that might have gone wrong, he said.
Jeff Layton agreed with that, "an integer return is not expressive
enough", which is the rationale for the mount-logging feature.
</p>

<p>
Another problem that occurs, Layton said, is that on a busy system there
may be lots of mounting going on, which makes it difficult to determine
the correspondence between messages and mount operations.  Brauner said
that the mount logging API has a prefix that can be associated with each
message.  While it is true that existing reporting mechanisms need to be
maintained, they are not consistent between filesystems. "How beautiful
would it be", he asked, if all of the error messages from VFS
had a "vfs:" prefixâ€”likewise for "bcachefs:" and the other filesystems.
</p>

<p>
Kent Overstreet said that bcachefs has a system of error codes that allows
developers to track down exactly where in the code a problem occurred,
which has been extremely useful.  Chinner said that XFS only reports
certain kinds of information to user space, while reporting the details and
exact location in the code when filesystem corruption is found, for
example, to <tt>dmesg</tt>.  The user-space report just tells the user to
unmount and run <tt>fsck</tt>; the details should not be sent to user
space, and the two types of information should be kept separate, he said.
</p>

<h4>Unknown options</h4>

<p>
Sandeen said that when he went to add support for the mount API to tracefs
and debugfs, he encountered a comment about ignoring unknown mount
options. But in the conversion process, most filesystems now reject unknown
mount options regardless of their earlier behavior.  One exception is NFS,
which has a <tt>sloppy</tt> mount option that means unknown options should
not cause an error. He wondered if there was a need to maintain the
previous behavior when converting.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>sloppy</tt> option is important for network filesystems, French said, because new options
may get added but not be available on every server.  Sandeen agreed, but
noted that <tt>sloppy</tt> has gotten even more complicated because it is
positional; it needs to be specified before any potentially unknown
option. Layton said that it is also needed for automount maps; in the past,
there were sites that were administering both Solaris and Linux systems
using the same maps, but the mount options did not line up between the two.
</p>

<p>
Brauner said that switching to using the new mount API is a conscious
decision, so changes to the behavior for things like unknown options would
be acceptable.  But, eventually, the plan is for the existing
<tt>mount</tt> command to use the new API, which will need to preserve the
existing behavior.  So there will need to be a way to do that.
</p>

<p>
"Remount is even worse", Brauner said. Most filesystems will accept any
options for remount then silently ignore those that they do not care about,
Sandeen said.  An attendee asked if the kernel should care; "should we
tell user space 'you can't remount that thing'?"  While he could not think
of an example, Brauner said that he could imagine a security-sensitive
mount option being passed to remount; in that case, user space would want
the operation to fail
if the option could not be handled.
</p>

<p>
The (re)mount-option handling has been inconsistent and broken forever,
Brauner said, but there is a need to be able to express the intent of a
given mount operation with respect to unknown-option handling.  That will
be needed for users of the new mount API and, eventually, for
<tt>mount</tt> itself.  There are other cases that are messy as well.  The
new API allows options to be specified one at a time, but if a new option
conflicts with an earlier one, there is no way to say which of the earlier
ones caused the conflict.
</p>

<p>
XFS has a table that tracks all of the possible options and which cannot be
used together so that they can be tied together in error messages, Chinner said.  Ts'o said
that ext4 has something similar.  Chinner did not think it was important to
handle that problem in a generic way since it is a corner case that does
not arise frequently.  While Howells said that handling conflicting options was
part of his initial proposal for the API, Al Viro had him remove it. As
time ran out on the session, Lennart Poettering agreed with
Chinner that user-space tools likely did not really want to handle that level of detail.

<p>
When designing a new logging API that is supposed to be consumed partially by programs and not just users in 2024 structured logging really should have been on the table, particularly for relatively low volumes of logs like this (where it does not matter if each log message takes a few microseconds longer if that makes the result much more useful).<br>

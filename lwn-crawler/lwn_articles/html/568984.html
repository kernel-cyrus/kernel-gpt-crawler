<h1>Transactional memory in the dentry cache</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 2, 2013</br>
           </div>
LWN recently <a href="/Articles/565734/">described the "lockref"
mechanism</a> merged into the 3.12 kernel.  Lockrefs aim to reduce locking
overhead in situations where all that needs to happen is the modification
of a reference count, but the data structure as a whole must be held
invariant while that count is changed.  This new locking primitive has
helped to reduce the overhead of locking in the system's dentry cache — the
extensive data structure that caches mappings between file names and
inodes.  But dentry cache overhead strongly affects the performance of the
system as a whole, so it is not surprising that there is a desire to
improve things even more; that appears to be especially true in the 3.12
development cycle, which has seen a lot of attention paid to the reduction
of core locking overhead.
<p>
One might think that it would be hard to improve on the performance of a
lockref in this area, but there is one technology that might just help in
this regard: transactional memory.  For some years now, transactional
memory has been one of those hardware features that was destined to solve a
number of our scalability problems.  As is often the case, that future has
been slow to arrive in the real world.  But some manufacturers are now
shipping CPUs with some transactional memory support built into them, and
software is starting to take advantage of this feature.  See, for example,
<a href="/Articles/534758/">this article</a> describing the work done to
add transactional memory support to the GNU C library.
<p>
Linus recently got an itch to upgrade to a newer, faster desktop computer;
when he chose his new processor, he made a point of getting one that
provided transactional memory support.  So, he decided, the time had come
to try to use that support to further speed dentry cache locking.  The
result was <a href="/Articles/568962/">a short, proof-of-concept patch</a>
that shows how things could work.  The core part of the patch is worth
showing directly:
<p>
<pre>
    asm goto("xbegin %l[repeat]": : :"memory","ax":repeat);
    if (unlikely(d_unhashed(dentry)))
    	goto xabort;
    if (unlikely(!is_simple_dput(dentry)))
    	goto xabort;
    if (unlikely(!arch_spin_value_unlocked(dentry-&gt;d_lock.rlock.raw_lock)))
    	goto xabort;
    dentry-&gt;d_lockref.count--;
    asm volatile("xend");
    return;

xabort:
    asm volatile("xabort $0");

repeat:
    /* Fallback to lockref code */
</pre>

<p>

The first line adds the <tt>xbegin</tt> instruction that starts the
transaction.  This instruction behaves a little strangely, in that its
influence extends over the code that follows.  Execution will continue with
the code after the <tt>xbegin</tt>, but, should the transaction abort for
any reason, all changes made during the transaction will be rolled back and
control will jump to the address provided to <tt>xbegin</tt> (the label
<tt>repeat</tt> in this case).
<p>
What follows is a set of tests to determine whether it is truly safe to
decrement the reference count without holding the dentry spinlock.  In
particular, the dentry must be hashed (have a name associated with it,
essentially), be on the LRU list, and not be locked.  Reading these fields
of the <tt>dentry</tt> structure adds them to the transaction; should some
other code make a change to one of them, the transaction will be aborted by
the processor.  If any of the tests show that the dentry is not in a
suitable state for a quick reference count decrement, the code uses the
<tt>xabort</tt> instruction to make the transaction fail.  Otherwise, the
reference count will be decremented and the <tt>xend</tt> instruction will
bring the transaction to a successful conclusion.  The reference count,
too, will become part of the transaction; should any other processor also
try to change it, the transaction will abort.
<p>
The code as written is clearly not intended for merging; one does not put
late-model x86 assembly code directly into generic filesystem code, after all.
But it is enough to get a sense for how well transactional memory works in
this situation.  According to Linus, "<q>profiles with this look
beautiful<q>", with the locking cost associated with the
<tt>dput()</tt> operation reduced essentially to zero.  So there may well
be a place for transactional memory within the dentry cache.
<p>
Whether this technique will see much wider use in the kernel remains to be
seen, though.  Andi Kleen posted <a href="/Articles/544125/">a patch using
transactional memory for most kernel locks</a> back in March, but that work
did not go very far, mostly because he could not provide any benchmark
numbers showing what kind of performance improvements could be expected.
In his patch, Linus made it clear that he suspects those improvements will be small,
saying "<q>I doubt the intel TSX patches are going to be useful (if they
were, Intel would be crowing about performance numbers now that the CPU's
are out, and they aren't).</q>"  Instead, he has suggested that this
feature will only be useful in a few places:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Quite frankly, from all I've seen so far, the kernel is not going
	to have very good luck with things like lock elision, because we're
	really fine-grained already, and at least the Intel lock-elision
	(don't know about POWER8) basically requires software to do
	prediction on whether the transaction will succeed or not,
	dynamically based on aborts etc. And quite frankly, by the time you
	have to do things like that, you've already lost. We're better off
	just using our normal locks.
<p>
	So as far as I'm concerned, transactional memory is going to be
	useful - *if* it is useful - only for specialized code. Some of
	that might be architecture-internal lock implementations, other
	things might be exactly the dput() kind of situation.
</div>
<p>
The end result is that Andi's patches may be a good starting point for
transactional memory support in a more architecture-independent way, but we
may not see transactional memory used as a general locking mechanism (or
lock-elision mechanism) in the kernel.
<p>
Along the lines of architecture-independence, it is worth noting that
Intel was not the first to ship a processor with transactional memory
support; the PowerPC
architecture has had similar functionality for a couple of years.
Naturally, the feature works a little differently in that architecture, but
the basic functionality is the same.  So it should be possible to create
some sort of wrappers around transactional memory that can be used in
common code.  That is, if kernel-space transactional memory can be made to
work at all in an efficient manner on PowerPC; there are <a
href="/Articles/568989/">some challenges</a> in the way of getting that
functionality working reliably.
<p>
What one might conclude is that, while transactional memory is a
useful technology for speeding up specific bits of high-profile kernel
code, it does not look like a general solution to the locking problem at
this point.  That could change in the future, of course, as hardware
transactional memory gets faster and more capable.  But, for now,
transactional memory looks mostly like a useful trick to squeeze a little
more performance out of a few highly optimized code paths.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems unlikely that transactional memory will be useful in userspace outside of very specialized applications and glibc. Among other things, when a transaction aborts, if the abort happens inside glibc code and there happens to have been a pthreads lock using TSX taken out glibc will assume (because it must) that it's its transaction that's aborted. If it's actually a nested one, things will go wrong. Some implementations provide 'abort codes' that you'd think might help in this situation, but there are a limited number of them, so they're effectively a not-yet-defined ABI. Maybe this will get defined and a few abort codes will be reserved for application code rather than the implementation, but until that happens I don't see how anyone other than glibc can use transactional memory safely.<br>
<p>
(This is probably a good thing nearly all the time: you *should* be using pthreads calls rather than rolling your own primitives using bleeding-edge arch-specific code.)<br>

From what I gather, even on Haswell, the nested transaction just is combined with the outer one. I.e. the commit of the inner transaction is basically ignored and only the outer commit has an actual meaning. A rollback in the nested transaction rolls back to the toplevel abort point.<br>

I agree. But, of course, that's not that obvious. You don't use those locks in glibc by calling a do_a_tsx_lock() function: it's done behind your back by the pthreads locking code, and you can't rely on that being the only place it's done without tying yourself to an internal implementation detail of glibc...

I think using TSX across *any* kind of lock is asking for trouble. And pthreads locking certainly is a kind of locking ;). There are some places where glibc uses locks internally that aren't immediately obvious, but those aren't ones that you'd likely use inside TSX either.<br>

      </p>It's good to see experimentation with the Intel transactional memory, but I think I'm sticking to what I said in <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/480713/">lwn.net/Articles/480713/</a>, including the part where I may be missing something. This may actually be useful in user space where, as far as I can tell, people spend less time per line of code on optimization. In that case, you may not get the fine-grained locking that we strive for in the kernel.</p>
<p>
Also, there may be rather different ways to do this--Intel doesn't have an exclusive on smart people.</p>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 21, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2018-Embedded_Linux_Conference">ELC</a>
</div>
It is an increasingly poorly kept secret that, underneath the hood of
the components that most of us view as "hardware", there is a great deal of
proprietary software.  This code, written by anonymous developers, rarely
sees the light of day; as a result, it tends to have all of the pathologies
associated with software that nobody can either review or fix.  The 2018
Embedded Linux Conference 
saw an announcement for a new project that, with luck, will change that
situation, at least for one variety of hardware: audio devices.
<p>
Intel's Imad Sousou took to the stage at ELC to introduce a couple of new
projects.  One of them was inspired by the <a
href="https://minnowboard.org/">MinnowBoard</a> project, which is working
to create development boards based entirely on free software.  That goal

<a href="/Articles/749890/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/elc/ImadSousou-sm.jpg" alt="[Imad Sousou]"
title="Imad Sousou" class="rthumb"></a>

has been almost completely achieved, he said, but there is an exception in
that the board requires a number of proprietary firmware components.  The
desire to fix that problem led to the creation of the <a
href="https://www.sofproject.org/">Sound Open Firmware</a> (SOF) project.
<p>
The objective behind SOF is to create open-source firmware for audio and
video-related devices.  This is, Sousou said, an area that has typically
been dominated by proprietary software.  This project has been jointly
launched with Google; there are, he suggested, plenty of opportunities for
contributors who might want to join this effort.  The code is released
under a combination of the BSD and GPLv2 licenses.
<p>
Sousou's talk stopped there, but a bit of digging can turn up some more
information.  The project has <a
href="https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Firmware">a
page on the ALSA project's wiki</a> describing where to find the software
and how to get started with it.  There is a software-development kit (SDK) to
install; building the firmware also requires a cross-compiler for the
<a href="http://wiki.linux-xtensa.org/index.php/Main_Page">Xtensa</a>
architecture.  The SDK includes an emulator that can be used during 
the development process; the SOF web site also notes that
"<q>proprietary compilers and emulators</q>" are available.
Currently, only Xtensa-based digital signal processors are supported, but
the project's intent is to eventually support a wider range of hardware.
<p>
The firmware itself is based on its own miniature kernel; it would appear
that a new kernel was developed rather than adapting one of the (many) existing
tiny kernels in circulation.  It includes an earliest-deadline first
scheduler and supports 
basic concepts like memory allocation, interrupt handling, work queues, and
more.  Using that, the firmware runs an "audio task" whose job is to move
data between the DMA buffers and the audio-processing components.
<p>
On the kernel side, SOF appears to present a semi-standard interface that
all drivers can use, but there is still a significant amount of
device-specific code required.  The code to support SOF-based devices can
be found in the ALSA system-on-chip tree
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lrg/asoc.git).  It is not
currently in the mainline; it also does not appear in linux-next, so it
will almost certainly not make an appearance before the 4.18 development
cycle.  There is <a
href="http://alsa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/sound-open-firmware">a
mailing list</a> with a fair amount of traffic; almost all of it comes from
Intel addresses, which is unsurprising for a project that has only just
been opened up to the world.
<p>
This project is in its infancy (despite the nearly 18 months of history on
the mailing list), but it has the potential to make things better in a
number of ways.  Manufacturers that participate in it may end up with
higher-quality firmware with less effort.  Developers interested in doing
new things with audio hardware should find SOF-based devices to be a good
starting point.  And, if the project succeeds, we'll all have systems
running a bit more free software at the lowest levels, which seems like a
good thing.
<p>
(For the curious, the other project announced in this talk was the <a
href="https://projectacrn.org">ACRN hypervisor</a>.  It is designed for
safety-critical systems and appears to support many of the features found
in systems like <a href="/Articles/745946/">seL4</a>.)

Sadly many laptop OEMs (including Lenovo Thinkpads) are requiring Intel/OEM signed binaries, so developers and end users aren't able to build the firmware themselves and run their own binaries. There seems to be some sort of debug/community keys that allow a limited feature set. I assume they disable DRM/HDMI or something similar.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 22, 2009</br>
           </div>
The 2.6.33 merge window has run its course, and a great deal of code has
been merged into the mainline.  The merge window always seems like a bit of
a game of musical chairs, though: when the music stops, at least one
project tends to be left conspicuously standing.  This time around, two
projects were left without a chair in the mainline despite having sent in
pull requests: the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/258516/">Ceph
distributed filesystem</a> and the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/345296/">AlacrityVM</a> hypervisor code.
<p>
Often, originators of ignored pull requests are left in silence to wonder why those
requests were not acted upon.  This time around, Linus <a
href="/Articles/367788/">explained the missing pulls</a>: there didn't seem
to be enough interest in those features.  As he put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The best thing to do is to try to have users that are vocal about
	the feature, and talk about how great it is. Some advocates for it,
	in other words. Just a few other people saying "hey, I use this,
	it's great", is actually a big deal to me. For alacrityvm and
	cephfs, I didn't have that, or they just weren't loud enough for me
	to hear.
</div>
<p>
Sun CEO Scott McNealy once remarked that free software is like a free
puppy.  There is some truth to that remark in general, and with respect to
code pulled into the kernel in particular.  The code itself comes for free,
with a nice, GPL-compatible license attached to it.  But the kernel
maintainers know that this new code is likely to make a few messes around
the house and chew up their favorite pair of slippers before it is properly
trained.  It also must be fed and taken for an occasional visit to the
veterinarian for years into the future.  So it is important to be sure
that, at a minimum, this is a puppy that users actually want.  That is why
Linus is asking for users to express their support for proposed new
features.
<p><blockquote class="ad">
<b><tt>$ sudo subscribe today</tt></b>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>

Getting that support can be a bit of a catch-22 situation, though.  It
takes a dedicated user indeed to grab an in-progress patch and build it
into their own kernel; most users will not do that.  Life can be easier if
distributions package proposed code, giving users a chance to test it out
without having to build and install a new kernel, but distributors can get
into trouble for doing that.  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366648/">The
recent fuss over Nouveau</a> was a clear example of unhappiness about
shipping out-of-tree kernel code.  Similarly, a few years ago, SUSE shipped
AppArmor without merging it 
first, drawing <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/239964/">this complaint</a>
from Andrew Morton:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Sigh.  Please don't put us in this position again.  Get stuff
	upstream before shipping it to customers, OK?  It ain't rocket
	science.
</div>
<p>
But getting the customers to request the software - within hearing of Linus
Torvalds - before it has been either merged or shipped to them can indeed
seem like rocket science at times.
<p>
There has been at least one public request for the merging of Ceph in a
future development cycle.  The bar may be even higher for AlacrityVM,
though.  There does not appear to be crowd of users asking for a new set of
virtualized device drivers which are meant to be used with an out-of-tree
virtualization mechanism.  Beyond that, past discussions about this code
have been long and heated, with some significant disagreements between
AlacrityVM developer Gregory Haskins and (in particular) the KVM
developers.
<p>
This history led Ingo Molnar to post <a href="/Articles/367796/">a
reminder</a> of flame wars past and a request that Gregory try harder to
work with the KVM development community.  Needless to say, this posting has
started another extensive discussion, with Gregory <a
href="/Articles/367797/">stating</a> that he has tried hard indeed to work
with the other developers, and that, in any case, the current AlacrityVM
posting, which consists mostly of drivers, is not relevant to KVM.  From
there, the discussion moved into whether this work is really necessary, the
best approaches to improving I/O performance in virtualized guests, and so
on. 
<p>
It's not clear that there is an obvious solution to this particular
disagreement other than having serious users try out the various solutions
and report on what works best.  That will be hard to do with an out-of-tree
virtualization solution, but the existence of this kind of controversy will
only make getting the code into the mainline harder.  Linus was <a
href="/Articles/367917/">quite clear</a> on that:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So when I see another virtualization interface, I want the
	virtualization people to just argue it out amongst
	themselves. Thanks to the virtue of me personally not caring one
	whit about virtualization, I can stand back and just watch the
	fireworks.
<p>
	Which is not to say that I enjoy it (I like the occasional
	flame-fest, but in order to like them I need to _care_ enough to
	get fired up about them!).  So I just don't want the in-fighting to
	take place in my tree, so I'd rather see the fighting die out
	_before_ I actually pull.
</div>
<p>
This code was
developed by SUSE, which, presumably, wishes to provide AlacrityVM to its
customers.  This may be one of those situations where the distributor has
no choice but to ship the code ahead of mainline integration, just to get
the user feedback that shows it's worthwhile.  That course has risks: the
code may never be merged, or it may suffer incompatible changes on its way
into the mainline later on.  But the alternative may be to see this code
languish on the sideline indefinitely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Citation needed.  I actually researched that quote; all roads lead to McNealy as far as I can tell.

      Maybe it was McNealy, then, but I'm pretty sure Jill wrote it. I'll ask her about it.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 6, 2021</br>
           </div>
Once upon a time, block storage devices were slow, to the point that they
often limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort
went into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of
the storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU
time.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.
Fancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now
focused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A
block-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of
tradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.
<p>
Within the block layer, an I/O operation is represented by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14/source/include/linux/blk_types.h#L215"><tt>struct bio</tt></a>; an instance of this structure is usually just called a
"BIO".  Contained within a BIO are a pointer to the relevant block device,
a description of the buffer(s) to be transferred, a pointer to a function
to call when the operation completes, and a surprising amount of ancillary
information.  A BIO must be allocated, managed, and eventually freed for
every I/O operation executed by the system.  Given that a large, busy
system with fast block devices can generate millions of I/O operations per
second (IOPS), huge numbers of BIOs will be going through this life cycle
in a constant stream.
<p>
The kernel's slab allocator is optimized for the task of repeatedly
allocating and freeing structures of a uniform size; it seems like it
should be well suited as a source of BIOs for the block subsystem.  It
turns out, though, that the slab allocator is not fast enough; it has
become a bottleneck slowing down block I/O.  So block maintainer Jens Axboe
has put together <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20210812154149.1061502-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">a set of
patches</a> to circumvent the problem.
<p>
The result is a simple cache of BIO structures.  It is built as a set of
linked lists, one for each CPU in the system.  When a new BIO is needed
(and when some other conditions are met â€” see below), the linked list for
the current CPU is checked; if a free BIO is found there, it can be removed
from the list and used
without having to call into the slab allocator.  If the list is empty, a
slab call must be made as usual, of course.  When the time comes to free a BIO,
it is put onto the current CPU's list.  Should the list grow too large
(more than 576 cached BIOs), 64&nbsp;BIOs will be handed back to the slab
allocator.
<p>
It is a simple mechanism, which is the source of its speed.  Rather than
calling into the slab allocator, the block layer can just grab an available
BIO directly off of the appropriate per-CPU list without any function calls
at all.  The use of a per-CPU list eliminates the need for locking,
speeding things further.  The lists are managed like a stack, maximizing
the chance that an allocated BIO will already be present in the CPU cache.
The end result is a significant improvement in performance.
<p>
At least, that is the case for some workloads.  The BIO cache is, as noted,
simple; one of the things it doesn't bother with is interrupt safety.  A
per-CPU data structure is only safe for lockless access if the kernel
cannot be preempted while executing the critical section; interrupts,
being the definitive form of preemption, violate that rule.  If a
block-driver interrupt handler tries to allocate or free a BIO while some
other kernel code is doing the same, the results are likely to be
unpleasant and users will be remarkably unappreciative of the improved
performance.
<p>
The BIO cache could be made interrupt-safe, of course, and someday that
might just have to happen.  But disabling interrupts has a performance cost
as well, so there are good reasons for avoiding it.  The cost associated
with leaving interrupts enabled
is that the BIO cache can only be used in situations where concurrent
access in interrupt handlers is not a possibility.  The good news is that
one such situation is well defined: when <a
href="/Articles/663879/">block-layer I/O polling</a> is in use.  Polling
turns off interrupts from the storage device in favor of simply looping
until an I/O request is 
completed; this can actually be a reasonable thing to do with fast devices.
In settings where getting the highest I/O rates possible is important,
administrators are likely to have polling enabled anyway; targeting this
additional performance improvement at that use case thus makes some sense.
<p>
Getting the slab allocator out of the loop improves performance
considerably, but there is one other bottleneck to overcome.  The block
layer has a function called <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14/source/block/bio.c#L240"><tt>bio_init()</tt></a>,
the core of which reads:
<p>
<pre>
    memset(bio, 0, sizeof(*bio));
</pre>
<p>
One might think that <tt>memset()</tt> would be the fastest way to
initialize a moderately sized structure like this, but that turns out not
to be the case.  So Axboe added <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20210812154149.1061502-2-axboe@kernel.dk/">a
patch</a> that replaces the <tt>memset()</tt> call with a series of
statements explicitly setting each BIO field to zero.  The changelog notes
that this change halves the time it takes to allocate and initialize a BIO
(when using the BIO cache, of course).
<p>
With these changes in place, Axboe said, the block layer's performance
increased by about 10%; it can now execute over 3.5&nbsp;million IOPS on
each CPU core on his test system.  That is a lot of blocks moving back and
forth, which will 
surely please the managers of storage servers.  This series shows what can
be (and must be) done to optimize I/O throughput on current hardware; it
also suggests, though, that it may be time to put some more optimization
effort into the (already highly optimized) slab allocator.  If the kernel
starts to fill up with per-subsystem object caches as a way of bypassing
the allocator, performance overall will suffer.  Meanwhile, though, few are
likely to argue that this effort to improve block-I/O performance is
anything but well placed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

A mis-predicted branch costs about 13 cycles, so 3 of them cover about 40 inline stores to memory (cache.)  memset does not know in advance the width or alignment of the destination, but the compiler does.  gcc __builtin_memset() could be a contender.<br>

Doesn&#x27;t the standard permit GCC to freely translate memset, __builtin_memset, and manually-written initialization code into each other? I&#x27;m mildly surprised that replacing memset with not-memset even changed the assembly output, and I&#x27;m also mildly surprised that GCC is not smart enough to do that transformation itself.<br>

      It should unless -ffreestanding or -fno-builtin is used. Linux only uses those option on a few select files, so I'm not sure what's going on... And as mentioned below in another comment, even with those options <tt>x = (struct foo) {0}</tt> generates the same code as __builtin_memset.

      <p>That's possibly why <code>memset</code> was slower. But it seems more likely the compiler will optimise away the unnecessary assignments if it can see them, rather than having them hidden behind a function call.</p>

<p>I just noticed that the proposed change no longer initializes the <code>bi_pool</code> field â€” it's being left uninitialized. <code>bi_pool</code> is zeroed in <code>bio_kmalloc</code>, but not in other callers to <code>bio_init</code>. I hope this is intentional. If it isn't, it's the kind of bug that struct assignment (or <code>memset</code>) would help guard against.</p>

      Sure, but <code>*bio = (struct bio){ 0 };</code> is not expected to set padding â€” when that's needed for security reasons, <code>memset</code> should be used.

The numbers themselves shouldn&#x27;t really be important, and they just come out of the fact that we should cap it somewhere (512) and that we batch in units of 64. Really anything would work here, as long as the batch+count is big enough to yield a reasonable win.<br>

      This sounds a lot like the per-cpu magazine and vmem idea [1].  The paper describes taking the idea further and generalizing it into its own vmem layer.  The magazine is also reloaded when emptied by asking the slab allocator for more.
<br>
I am surprised that the memset is slower.  Is this gcc on x86_64?  I had a quick look at the patch and didn't see it mentioned in the commit message.  Could this be some fancy intel instruction at work?

I guess there will be issues with fragmentation if the objects in the BIO cache doesn&#x27;t have similar lifespans.<br>
<p>
But it sounds like the BIO cache layer could become more generic and sit between other subsystems and the slab allocator (but with a separate BIO cache instance per subsystem/slab usage)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  At least, that is the case for some workloads. The BIO cache is, as noted, simple; one of the things it doesn&#x27;t bother with is interrupt safety. A per-CPU data structure is only safe for lockless access if the kernel cannot be preempted while executing the critical section; interrupts, being the definitive form of preemption, violate that rule. If a block-driver interrupt handler tries to allocate or free a BIO while some other kernel code is doing the same, the results are likely to be unpleasant and users will be remarkably unappreciative of the improved performance.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The BIO cache could be made interrupt-safe, of course, and someday that might just have to happen. But disabling interrupts has a performance cost as well, so there are good reasons for avoiding it.</font><br>
<p>
Why not make the bio cache a truly lockless data structure (using hardware atomic operations)?<br>

      I have long thought that having a memory range dedicated to finish-this-first operations, so interrupts would check whether one was in progress and if so finish it before handling the interrupt, would pay.  So a per-cpu-compare-and-swap could simply be the load, compare, conditional store, return; and so on. Have a hardwired page dedicated to the finish-first pseudo-atomics, if the PC's on that page (which only the kernel can access) the interrupt handler knows where the return pointer is, inserts itself and continues it, knowing it'll be back very soon.

      A dedicated page for kernel code the interrupt handler allows to complete before handling the interrupt. Reserve a register in that code for the interrupt handler and it'd be "if(unlikely(ffi-inflight set and interrupted pc on that page)) save the interrupted routines's return address, replace it with me, branch back to the interrupted instruction, restore the return address".

I&#x27;m not a kernel hacker so I genuinely don&#x27;t know the answer to these questions:<br>
<p>
1. Is it always possible/safe to do that kind of return-to-interrupt-handler chicanery? How does this interact with trampoline/retpoline-like things?<br>
2. Do interrupts have additional state which might need to be saved and restored? If so, who owns that memory?<br>
3. What if a second interrupt happens after you&#x27;ve futzed with the return address, but before the interrupted routine returns?<br>

      Not always, but if you keep tight control over what kind of code the interrupt handler decides to finish this way, sure. For instance, you have complete control over the call/return sequence. Interrupts definitely have to preserve state, in memory owned by that specific core / hardware thread (an msr shows where). Interrupt handlers are entered interrupts-off, they don't turn them back on until they've got enough state saved that the kernel code can take another without corrupting things.

And atomic cannot ensure the coherence of a whole structure. If you have more than one fields to update, you&#x27;re screwed.<br>

Seeing how many memset()s in the kernel are of the form: memset(ptr, 0, size) why not allow bzero(ptr, size) which obviously saves one passed parameter and some typing. It makes FreeBSD driver code a bit easier to read. Maybe it could open the door to other optimizations, for example, if ptr is page aligned.<br>

According to bzero(3) on Linux:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The bzero() function is deprecated (marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001); use memset(3) in new programs.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of bzero().</font><br>
<p>
As for *why* they decided to do that, you&#x27;ll have to take it up with the standards people.<br>
<p>
(Obviously, that man page is describing the glibc version of bzero. I&#x27;m fairly certain the kernel doesn&#x27;t link with glibc, at least in the normal fashion. But it hardly matters, because POSIX is POSIX regardless of who&#x27;s implementing it.)<br>

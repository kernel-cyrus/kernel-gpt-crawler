           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 27, 2019</br>
           </div>
One of the first uses of the <a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF virtual
machine</a> outside of networking was to implement access-control policies
for the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
system call.  Since then, though, the role of BPF in the security area has
not changed much in the mainline kernel, even though BPF has evolved
considerably from the "classic" variant still used with <tt>seccomp()</tt>
to the "extended" BPF now supported by the kernel.  That has not been for a
lack of trying, though.  The out-of-tree Landlock security module was <a
href="/Articles/703876/">covered here</a> over three years ago.  We also <a
href="/Articles/798157/">looked at</a> the kernel runtime security
instrumentation (KRSI) patch set in September.  KP&nbsp;Singh has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191220154208.15895-1-kpsingh@chromium.org/">a new
KRSI series</a>, so the time seems right for a closer look.
<p>
While KRSI is implemented as a Linux security module and is able to make
access-control decisions, access control does not appear to be the core
goal behind this work.  Instead, KRSI exists to keep an eye on system
behavior overall in order to detect attacks.  It is, in a sense, better
thought of as an extension of the kernel's audit mechanism that uses BPF to
provide a higher level of configurability beyond what the audit subsystem
can do.
<p>
The concept behind KRSI is simple enough: it allows a suitably privileged
user to attach a BPF program to any of the hundreds of hooks provided by
the Linux security module subsystem.  To make this attachment easy, KRSI
exports a new filesystem hierarchy under <tt>/sys/kernel/security/bpf</tt>,
with one file for each hook.  The <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html">bpf()</a></tt>
system call can be used to attach a BPF program (of the new type
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM</tt>) to any of these hooks; there can be more than
one program attached to any given hook.  Whenever a security hook is
called, all attached BPF programs will be called in turn; if any BPF
program returns an error status, then the requested action will be denied.
<p>
Many readers will be thinking that this mechanism sounds a lot like
Landlock.  While the fundamental idea — attaching BPF programs to
security-module hooks — is the same, the underlying goals are different,
and that leads to a different implementation.  KRSI is a tool for system
administrators who are interested in monitoring the behavior of the system
as a whole; attaching a BPF program requires the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>
capability.  Landlock, instead, is intended to allow unprivileged users to
sandbox programs that they are running, so no privilege is needed to attach
a BPF program to a hook via Landlock.
<p>
This difference fundamentally affects how these modules execute.  Consider,
for example, the hook that the kernel calls in response to an
<tt>mprotect()</tt> call from user space:
<p>
<pre>
    int security_file_mprotect(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long reqprot,
			       unsigned long prot);
</pre>
<p>
In KRSI, the three parameters to this hook will be passed directly to any
attached BPF programs; those programs can follow the <tt>vma</tt> pointer
to learn all about the affected memory area.  They can also follow 
<tt>vma-&gt;vm_mm</tt> to get to the calling processes
top-level memory-management data (the <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure).  There
is, in short, a lot of information available to these programs.
<p>
The Landlock situation is different.  Since Landlock hooks are under the
control of unprivileged users, they cannot be allowed to just wander
through kernel data structures.  So a Landlock hook for <tt>mprotect()</tt>
is passed a structure like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct landlock_ctx_mem_prot {
        __u64 address;
	__u64 length;
	__u8 protections_current;
	__u8 protections_requested;
    };
</pre>
<p>
In other words, the information passed to this hook contains nothing that
user space did not already know.  That makes it safe for the intended use
case, but is likely to be too limiting for the global auditing case.
<p>
The advent of speculative-execution vulnerabilities, along with other
factors, has led to a slow simmer of questions about whether it can ever be
safe to allow unprivileged users to run extended BPF code in the kernel.
The BPF developers themselves have been <a href="/Articles/796328/">coming
to the conclusion</a> that it cannot be done, and have scaled back their
plans to make unprivileged BPF available.  Indeed, even Mickaël Salaün, the
author of Landlock, now <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/a6b61f33-82dc-0c1c-7a6c-1926343ef63e@digikod.net/">feels</a>
that "<q>it is quite challenging to safely expose eBPF to malicious
processes</q>".  He went on to say:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm working on a version of Landlock without eBPF, but still with
	the initial sought properties: safe unprivileged composability,
	modularity, and dynamic update. I'll send this version soon.
</div>
<p>
So, while it may tempting to see KRSI and Landlock as being in competition
with each other, that does not really appear to be the case.
<p>
There does not appear to be any fundamental opposition to KRSI — so far — but Casey
Schaufler did <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/95036040-6b1c-116c-bd6b-684f00174b4f@schaufler-ca.com/">raise</a>
the inevitable concern with this approach: "<q>This effectively exposes
the LSM hooks as external APIs.  It would mean that we can't change or
delete them.</q>"  API issues often come up around BPF, especially in the
tracing area, so it is unsurprising that this question would arise here.
In this case, Singh <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CACYkzJ5nYh7eGuru4vQ=2ZWumGPszBRbgqxmhd4WQRXktAUKkQ@mail.gmail.com/">replied</a>: "<q>we *do not* want to make LSM hooks
a stable API and expect the eBPF programs to adapt when such changes
occur</q>".  It has repeatedly been made clear, though, that such
expectations do not override the kernel's stable-ABI rules.  Given the
power that would be available to KRSI hooks, it is reasonable to expect
that they would be used for a range of purposes far beyond those envisioned
by its developers.  If unrelated kernel changes break the resulting
programs, there is a good chance that they would be reverted.
<p>
Additionally, one could argue that this kind of problem is more likely to
come about with KRSI than with, for example, tracepoints.  While
tracepoints have been added as an explicit way to make specific information
available to user space, the security-module hooks were designed for
internal use.  They expose a lot of information, in internal-kernel formats,
that one might otherwise not choose to make available even to privileged
users.  That can only make them more likely to break as those kernel data
structures change.  Changes to the security hooks are not that common, but
they do happen (<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e3f20ae21079">example</a>); developers
are unlikely to react well to the idea that they would no longer be able to
make that kind of change.
<p>
The ABI issue could thus end up being the biggest obstacle to the merging
of KRSI, even though such concerns have not (yet) stalled efforts in areas
like tracing.  It will be interesting to see what happens as the awareness
of this functionality spreads.  The usefulness of KRSI seems clear, but the
potential for long-term problems it could bring is rather murkier.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What I don't understand is why this is seen/enforced as a hard and fast rule.  Why can't some parts of the ABI, that is accessible to user space, be declared to be unstable?<br>

      <p>The rule as enforced is that an ABI change cannot break existing userspace - so changing ABI that's never used is absolutely fine. The goal is that you never get stuck on an old kernel version due to ABI changes, and thus there is never a reason to port features between ABI versions.

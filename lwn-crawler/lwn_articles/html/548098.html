<h1>LSFMM: Problems with mmap_sem</h1>

<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
The top-level data structure describing a process's virtual address space
is called <tt>struct&nbsp;mm_struct</tt>; it contains a reader/writer
semaphore called <tt>mmap_sem</tt> that serializes changes to the
structure and to a number of related data structures.  The opening session
in the memory-management track at the 2013 Linux Filesystem, Storage, and
Memory Management Summit looked at a specific problem relating to this
semaphore and how it might be addressed.
<p>
The problem has to do with the order in which locks are acquired.  For
normal filesystem operations, the filesystem code will obtain any locks it
requires; the memory management subsystem will then grab <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
should that be required — to bring a read or write buffer into RAM, for
example.  When a page fault happens, though, the lock ordering is reversed:
first <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is taken, then the filesystem code is invoked to
bring the needed page into RAM.  Inconsistent lock ordering is a highly
effective way to deadlock the system, so this behavior is a bit of a
problem.  It has, for the most part, been worked around in the filesystem
code, but those workarounds are getting harder to maintain.
<p>
As an example, one of the more problematic locks is <tt>i_mutex</tt>, which
protects access to an <tt>inode</tt> structure.  In this case, lock
inversion problems have been worked around by using a different lock in the
page fault path; this approach works but lacks elegance.  There has been
talk of turning <tt>i_mutex</tt> into a "range lock," so that only a
portion of a file would need to be locked at any given time; that would
enable filesystems to avoid lock ordering problems most of the time.  But
the real point that was made by filesystem developers is that
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> is entirely unneeded within the filesystem code; perhaps
the memory management code could just drop that lock before calling into
filesystems?
<p>
The problem with that idea, according to Michel Lespinasse, is that
filesystem calls result in the placement of pages into the page cache, and,
from there, into the relevant process's page tables.  Changes to page
tables cannot be done without holding <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  It was suggested
that the problem could be solved by dropping <tt>mmap_sem</tt> before
calling into the filesystem, then scanning the page cache to update page
table entries after the filesystem code has done its work.  This approach
was seen as workable, but, it was pointed out, if <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is to
be dropped it must be dropped in <i>every</i> path that calls into the
filesystem code.

<p>
One might think that there shouldn't be too many such paths, but the
situation is a bit more complicated that that, thanks to
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, which is used by kernel code to fault in
user-space pages.  Jan Kara reported that he has audited some 50
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> call sites in the kernel and found that most of
them can use <tt>get_user_pages_fast()</tt> instead.  That's an important
change; <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> requires that <tt>mmap_sem</tt> be held
by the caller, while <tt>get_user_pages_fast()</tt> does not.  So changing
all those call sites would eliminate a long list of paths by which
filesystem code can be called with <tt>mmap_sem</tt> held.  
<p>

Another approach might be to use a sequence counter to track changes to the
address space; that would eliminate the need for a real lock much of the
time.  But that approach adds other challenges: measures would have to be
taken to keep the relevant virtual memory area (VMA) and file structures
around while the filesystem code is doing its thing, for example.  Changes
to the VMA 
itself are also possible and would have to be watched for.  There is also a
possibility that some architectures would have to be changed: if the
counter indicates that a change has been made, it may be necessary to retry
an attempt to satisfy a page fault, but not all architectures have fault
retry code in place. 
<p>
A possible worst case scenario would be a process that incurs a page fault
on a given VMA.  While the fault is being handled, the memory could be
unmapped, causing the VMA to be deleted; then another, unrelated VMA could
be instantiated for the same address range.  There is little good that
could come from this kind of confusion.  A sequence counter that
incremented for every address space change would catch such occurrences,
but Hugh Dickins worried that it could often be incremented for unrelated
events, slowing page fault handling.
<p>
The session had few in the way of definitive conclusions.  Jan said that he
would continue to look at users of <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> with the goal
of eventually eliminating the need to hold <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  That will
take some work since, he said, some device drivers include complicated
<tt>fault()</tt> handlers that do tricky things.  The <tt>fault()</tt>
function could, perhaps, be called without <tt>mmap_sem</tt> someday, but
that may come at the cost of adding a separate <tt>fault_locked()</tt> for
the few places where <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is truly needed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 15, 2012</br>
           </div>
Many devices are unable to function until the host system has loaded them
with their operating firmware.  Runtime-loadable firmware
has some real advantages: the hardware can be a little cheaper to make, and the
firmware is easily upgraded after the hardware has been sold.  But it also
poses some problems, especially when combined with other features.
Properly handling firmware loading over suspend/resume cycles has been a
challenge for the kernel for some time, but a new set of patches may be
poised to make things work better with little or no need for changes to
drivers.
<p>
The obvious issue with suspend/resume is that any given device may lose its
firmware while the system is suspended.  The whole point of suspending the
system is to reduce its power consumption to a minimum, so that operation
may well power down peripheral devices entirely.  Loss of firmware during
suspend doesn't seem like it should be a big problem; the driver can just
load the firmware again at resume time.  But firmware tends to live on
disk, and the actual firmware loading operation involves the running of a
helper process in user space.  Neither the disk nor user space are
guaranteed to be available at the point in the resume process when a given
device wants its firmware back; drivers that attempt to obtain firmware at
such times may fail badly.  The result is resume failures; they may be of
the intermittent, developer-never-sees-it variety that can be so
frustrating to track down.  So the search has been on for a more robust
solution for some time.
<p>
In July, Ming Lei tried to address this problem with <a
href="/Articles/511114/">a patch</a> integrating firmware loading with the
deferred driver probing mechanism.  In short, if a firmware load fails, the
whole driver initialization process would be put on the deferred queue to
be retried later on.  So, a driver that is unable to load its firmware at
resume time will be put on hold and retried at a later point when, hopefully, the
resources required to complete the firmware load will be available.  That,
Ming hoped, would resolve a lot of resume-time failures without requiring
changes to lots of drivers.
<p>
Linus, however, <a href="/Articles/511115/">disagreed</a>: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Sure, for a lot of devices it's fine to load the firmware
	later. But some devices may be part of the resume sequence in very
	critical ways, and deferring the firmware loading will just mean
	that the resume will fail.
</div>
<p>
Deferring firmware loading in this manner, he thought, would just serve to
hide problems from developers but leave them to burn users later on.  It
is much better, he thought, to force driver writers to deal with the
problem explicitly.
<p>
The classic way for a driver writer to handle this problem is to just keep
the firmware around after it is loaded at system boot time.  Permanently
cached firmware will always be available when it is needed, so firmware
loading at resume time should be robust.  The problem with that approach is
that the firmware blobs loaded into some devices can be quite large;
keeping them around forever can waste a fair amount of kernel-space
memory.  To make things worse, these blobs are loaded into
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> memory (so that they appear to be contiguous in memory);
that memory can be in short supply on 32-bit systems.  Permanently caching
the firmware is, thus, not an ideal solution, but that is what a number of
drivers do now.
<p>
After the discussion with Linus, Ming thought for a while and came back
with <a href="/Articles/509827/">a new proposal</a>: cache firmware blobs,
but only during the actual suspend/resume cycle.  Drivers can, of course,
do that now; they can request a copy of the firmware while suspending their
devices, and release that copy once it's no longer needed at resume time.
But that is a chunk of boilerplate code that would need to be added to each
driver.  Ming's patch, instead, makes this process automatic and
transparent.
<p>
In particular, <tt>request_firmware()</tt> is changed to make a note of the
name of every firmware blob it is asked to load.  This information is
reference-counted and tied to the devices that needed the firmware; it can
thus be 
discarded if all such devices disappear.  The result is a simple data
structure tracking all of the firmware blobs that may be needed by the
hardware currently present in the system.
<p>
At system suspend time, the code simply goes and loads every piece of
firmware that it thinks may be needed.  That data then sits in memory while
the system is suspended.  At resume time, those cached blobs are available
to any driver, with no need for filesystem access or user-space
involvement, via the usual <tt>request_firmware()</tt> interface.  Once 
the resume process is complete, the firmware loader will, after a small
delay, release all of those cached firmware images, freeing the associated
memory and address space for other uses.
<p>
The patch seems close to an ideal solution.  Firmware loading at resume
time becomes more robust, there is no need for drivers to be concerned with
how it works, and wasted memory is minimized.  Even Linus <a
href="/Articles/511120/">said</a> 
"<q>Nothing in this patchset made me go 'Eww'<q>", which, from him,
can be seen 
as reasonably high praise.  It doesn't solve every problem; there are, for
example, <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=132554118928398&w=2">some
strange devices</a> that retain firmware over a reboot but not over
suspend, so the system may not know that a specific firmware image is
needed until resume time, when it's too late.  But such hardware is
probably best handled as a special case.  For the rest, we may be close to
a solution that simply works—and that brings an end to the recurring
"firmware at resume time" discussions on the mailing lists.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Firmware loading happens through udev.  The kernel raises a hotplug event which udev sees.  See <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/firmware%5Fclass/README;hb=HEAD">this README</a>.  On Ubuntu, /lib/udev/rules.d/50-firmware contains the udev rule, which runs the /lib/udev/firmware binary whenever the kernel requests a firmware file.</p>

<p>The reason is because the kernel can run in strange environments: read only root file system, running with containers with locked down root filesystems, etc.  With filesystem namespaces, there is no single filesystem so the kernel has no idea where to look for files.  Even calling into custom filesystem code from somewhere else in the kernel is somewhat icky.  Instead the kernel just requests userspace take care of it.</p>

I'm going to clutter this up with an off-topic comment.  It tickles me pink to see more and more non-US/Euro names show up as contributors.  I realize Ming Lei may well be a US or EU citizen or resident, but the more "non-traditional" names show up, the more likely they come from all over the world, and that just makes me smile.<br>
<p>
I also realize this comment could easily come off sounding rather strange and perhaps be taken wrongly, so maybe I can forestall some of that by saying again that I like this perceived change, and if I am slow to perceive it, if it has been obvious to everyone else for years and years, well, pardon me, but it still strikes me as a positive sign in so many ways that I can't help but smile and think the world is becoming a better place in many ways: Linux, free source software, expanding horizons, less poverty from the spread of technology, world peace, and more varieties of beer spreading around the world as tokens of code appreciation.<br>

There might be a(nother) case where this new mechanism won't work.<br>
<p>
If you attach USB device while the system is suspended, on resume the usb-core would find it and probe a driver for it. That driver would try to load a firmware, but because it have never been loaded before it won't be found in the "cache".<br>
<p>
Honestly, why is userland even involved in firmware loading? The whole userland shenanigan should be scraped and reverted to the old system where the kernel loads the firmware directly from the filesystem. If the kernel modules are accessible, then the firmware would be accessible too. (Use tmpfs or initrd as workarounds for the other cases.)<br>

I pretty much concur. The userspace loader causes problems even when it isn't being used at all. e.g. I just got a new machine with a Barts GPU in it (ATI Radeon 6870), and since I have a largely non-modular kernel with KMS built in I put all the firmware I thought it would need into CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE. I forgot one file... so the system hung for something like sixty seconds(!) trying to call out to userspace to load the firmware -- even though PID 1 had not yet been forked off! Of course because this was brand-new hardware and it was right at modesetting time I thought I'd messed something up in the .config or there was something major missing in the kernel's KMS support or something like that.<br>
<p>
The whole thing is a complete trainwreck, from the need to dig through source code to find the right names to jam in CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE through the userspace loading that you can use except in unusual situations such as if you have even a single firmware-using module built into the kernel or if you need even a single firmware-using module to resume from hibernation. (Oh, and how much assistance does the kernel give you in detecting that you have either of those situations? None, that's how much. It just dies without a message at the appropriate time. IIRC there's been talk about fixing the hibernation side of this, but I don't think anything ever came of it.)<br>
<p>
This whole thing was designed entirely to let distro vendors produce something without violating the GPL, and it does that -- but unfortunately it makes it bloody hard for the rest of us to produce working systems without digging through the source code if we have anything needing firmware at all, even if we're not using modules for anything.<br>
<p>
(Sorry, Matthew, I really don't like to criticise your work -- but this banjaxed-up firmware-loading mess just wasted several hours of my time hunting for a 'lockup' that wasn't, due to a hugely overlong timeout that even the stupidest kernel should not have incurred, on a kernel with no loadable firmware of any sort, before userspace was even running. This is not something that has been tested in the non-modular case with an eye to not being intolerably awful.)<br>

Another cool feature is that if you are trying to build a non-modular driver that requires firmware that's included in the kernel sources, and have KBUILD_OUTPUT set compilation will fail due to a "not found" error until you manually copy the firmware directory to $KBUILD_OUTPUT<br>

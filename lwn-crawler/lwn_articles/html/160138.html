<h1>4K stacks - again</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted November 15, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The question of whether the i386 architecture should move to using 4K
kernel stacks by default has been raised a few times; LWN last <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/150580/">covered the 4K stack issue</a> in
September.  Adrian Bunk has started the discussion anew with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/159934/">this proposal</a> that the -mm tree
go to 4K stacks (only) now, with an eye toward changing the mainline for
2.6.16.
<p>

Most of the technical issues have not changed since September, so those
arguments will not be repeated here.  It is worth noting that layered block
devices and filesystems have mostly been fixed.  In past kernels, highly
stacked devices (think of a combination of RAID, encryption, and network
filesystems) could end up with very long call chains in the kernel, and, as
a result, overflow the kernel stack.  Most of these calls have since been
serialized, so block-layer stacking should not be a problem.
<p>

The issue that remains is NDISwrapper, the glue layer which allows Windows
NDIS drivers to be loaded into a Linux kernel.  Windows runs with a much
larger kernel stack size, so NDIS driver writers have no reason to be as
careful about stack usage.  And, of course, these drivers cannot be fixed
to work properly with Linux.  Some have argued that breaking NDISwrapper is
not a possibility, since many users rely upon it to make their wireless
network adapters work.  But patience with this line of thought is running
thin, as can be seen in <a href="/Articles/160146/">this outburst</a> from
Dave Jones:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If we continue down this path, we'll have no native wireless
	drivers for Linux.  The answer is not to complain to linux-kernel
	for breaking ndiswrapper, but complain to the vendors for not
	releasing specifications for native drivers to be written.
</div>
<p>
The good news is that <a href="/Articles/160147/">the wireless situation is
not as bad as one might think</a>.  There is <a
href="http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net/">documentation for Broadcom
chips</a> available now, and <a href="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/">a
Broadcom driver</a> is in the works.  There is also <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/kernel-mentors/2005-August/000347.html">an
Atheros driver</a> which is "nearly done."  Once these drivers are complete
and joined with the Intel drivers already in the mainline, Linux will have
much better support for wireless devices, and far fewer systems will have
any reason to use NDISwrapper.
<p>

There are a number of reasons for going with the 4K stack mode, including
better performance and higher reliability.  Some distributions (e.g. Fedora
Core and RHEL) have been shipping 4K kernels for a while now.  So, while
nobody has committed to moving the mainline (or -mm) toward 4K-only yet,
chances are improving that it will happen sometime in the not-too-distant
future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm just looking forward to rt2500 support getting into the mainline   <br>
kernel.  It's one of the few 54mb chipsets that has had a GPL driver (and   <br>
the OpenBSD crowd, sticklers for hardware openness, recommends those   <br>
cards), but so far it has to be added separately.   <br>
   <br>
Hey, if a Broadcom driver is coming, that would have some positive   <br>
implications for Linksys WRT54G boxes.  But I get no such host when  <br>
trying to link to <a href="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/">http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/</a>. <br>

      I second that.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a d-link dwl-g122 (h/w ver. b1) 802.11g usb thingy which uses one of those ralink rt2500 chip things and it would be sweet if this got into the mainline kernel - especially before Dapper is released. The source is here <a href=http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>serialmonkey</a>. Hope this helps somebody.<br><br>regards,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anto

      Aha,<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reply to myself. I just checked... The rt2500usb driver is in 2.6.15 in Dapper. I don't know when this went in, odd, I've been following the announcements quite closely. I tried it out and didn't get it working so it's back to 2.6.12 and ndiswrapper for now. Maybe somebody more masochistic and not with exam deadlines looming might give it a go. (Am I the only person who hates iwconfig? It is terse to the point of mute. I've also got that dropped connection problem using dhcp over wireless that people are complaining about with Fedora, SUSE, Ubuntu and elsewhere. It is a pain.)<br><br>
regards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anto

      I am looking forward to a fully opensource Atheros driver in the kernel. I'm currently using the madwifi driver, which unfortunately has a closed part (better than nothing...)<br>

      There are still some questions on how the atheros driver was generated.<br>
Not using a clean reverse engineering process it seems.<br>

      But that was about the old Atheros driver which is distributed out-of-kernel, right?  Or is that about the new driver... or are they in fact the same other than the firmware?<br>

      I don't know much about this but...:<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be possible to move NDISwrapper into user space?<br>
<p>
TAP, or somesuch, could shim the network device access. Getting<br>
access to the hardware would be the tricky part, although it should<br>
be fairly easy for USB dongles, and various mapping tricks<br>
might work for 'normal' devices.<br>
<p>
Of course, in userspace stack size is not much of an issue...<br>

      NDISwrapper has no problem with 4K stacks. The problem is that the drivers it wraps can expect up to a 12K stack. Of course, Linux has never provided more than an 8K stack, so a given driver wouldn't necessarily work, but a number of popular drivers don't run out of stack even with only 4K.<br>

      Could someone elaborate on what it means to 'serialize' the historically long call chains associated with block devices + lvm2 + nfs + firewall, etc?<br>

      it goes like this; there is a key function that is used to submit IO<br>
and DM and co need to change the IO a bit and then cause it to be submitted again<br>
<p>
<p>
XFS -&gt; function -&gt; dm layer -&gt; function -&gt; dm layer -&gt; function -&gt; raid layer -&gt; function -&gt; scsi layer -&gt; driver<br>
<p>
<p>
(well theoretical example but you get the idea I hope)<br>
<p>
in the new situation, instead of calling the function again, you return "do again" so it goes like<br>
<p>
XFS -&gt; function -&gt; dm layer -|<br>
       function -&gt; dm layer -|<br>
       function -&gt; raid layer -|<br>
       function -&gt; scsi layer -&gt; driver<br>
<p>
so the max depth is 4 (well real world is slightly more complex) independent on how often you layer this. In the old situation you could layer a lot and go really big (11 in the example, but just layer more and it goes higher)<br>

      I use <a href="http://prism54.org/">prism54 cards</a>.  The driver is GPLed (not counting 
proprietary firmware).  It Just Works if you install Ubuntu.  On the down side, you have to very 
carefully search to find a card which has a prism54 chipset.  In fact, they might not be available any 
more.  Also, I had persistent problems with performance at long range.  My Mac Airport Extreme 
would buzz along just fine in that situation, but the prism54 system would stop working every 
minute or so.

      The FSF has information about hardware with FLOSS drivers.
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/net/wireless/cards.html">
Here's the FSF information on wireless cards.</a>
After looking around, I bought a Ralink RT2500-based card,
an Asus WL-107G, for my lapttop -- it only cost $30, it supports b and g,
and Ralink gives excellent support for FLOSS.  There is active work to improve the driver further, too.
No doubt there are others, but basing your purchasing decision on "what is supported" is usually a good plan when you can do it!

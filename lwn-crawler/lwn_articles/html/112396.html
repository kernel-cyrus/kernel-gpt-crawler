<h1>Should FUSE be merged?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted November 23, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="/Articles/68104/">Filesystems in User Space (FUSE) patch</a>
has been around for some time.  FUSE acts as a kernel filesystem which
turns around and passes all VFS requests out to a user-space daemon, which
is expected to do something reasonable with them.  There are <a
href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/filesystems.html">numerous projects using
FUSE</a> to implement interesting filesystems in user space.  The FUSE
developers have now <a href="/Articles/112397/">requested that FUSE be
merged</a> into the 2.6 kernel.  They may yet get there, but some obstacles
stand in the way.
<p>

Linus started by <a href="/Articles/112399/">complaining</a> that FUSE was
"too messy."  Some of his impressions, it turns out, may have been based on
a reading of old code.  Some of the things he was complaining about were
parts of the 2.4 version of the patch; they are not present in the version
being put forward for inclusion.
<p>

There is, however, one show-stopping problem which remains in the code.  If
the system's memory gets to be full of dirty pages which must be written to
a FUSE filesystem, and the user-space process which implements that
filesystem has been swapped out, the system can deadlock.  It cannot clean
up those dirty pages until they have been written to the backing store, it
cannot write those pages until the user-space daemon has been paged in, and
it cannot page in the daemon until the dirty pages are cleaned.  The system
comes to a screeching halt and the users reconsider the whole idea of
user-space filesystems.
<p>

The problem is most easily demonstrated through the use of shared writable
mappings.  With such mappings, user space can create vast numbers of dirty
pages without the operating system knowing about it.  Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/112413/">demonstrated</a> that this is not just a
theoretical problem; it can be made to happen on real systems.  The problem
can also be made to happen by simply writing too much data to the
filesystem.  All this led Linus to <a href="/Articles/112414/">lecture</a>
on the topic:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Guys, there is a _reason_ why microkernels suck. This is an example
	of how things are _not_ "independent". The filesystems depend on
	the VM, and the VM depends on the filesystem. You can't just split
	them up as if they were two separate things (or rather: you _can_
	split them up, but they still very much need to know about each
	other in very intimate ways).
</div>
<p>

In this case, the worst problems can be avoided by simply disallowing
shared, writable mappings.  That limitation will not, in fact, bother too
many people; these mappings are not heavily used.  It's also necessary to
take steps like limiting the number of pages currently queued for writing
out.  This limit will affect users, in that it will reduce performance.  It
has been noted, however, that deadlocks tend to have an even worse impact
on performance.
<p>

In response to the above concerns (and others), the FUSE patches <a href="/Articles/112199/">have been
reworked</a>.  Among other things, the shared, writable mapping support has
been split out into a separate, optional patch.  There's no word on whether
it will be merged, though Linus did <a href="/Articles/112415/">suggest
that it might</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm a sucker. Ask anybody. I'll accept the exact same patch that I
	rejected earlier if you just do it the right way. I'm convinced
	that some people actually do it on purpose just for the amusement
	value ("Look, he did it _again_. What a doofus!")
</div>
<p>

Whether Andrew Morton is so gullible remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Would it be unreasonable to simply expect the program implementing the user-space filesystem to lock itself into memory?  If it is unable to do so, perhaps due to lack of locking permission, it could produce a warning to the user or syslog.

      If it is unable to do so, then that means it is not running as root or is untrusted (i.e. not approved of by SELinux or some other security mechanism).  If that is the case, you don't want a "warning" - you want to guarantee that it cannot lock the machine.  You only want trusted code to even have the possibility of locking up the machine and trusted code would then always have the ability to lock itself into memory, since you trust it.<br>

      It isn't unreasonable, but it is insufficient. <br>
Almost any syscall can internally allocate memory. Such allocations are <br>
not helped by locking a task into memory. <br>

           <p>This article was contributed by Marta Rybczy≈Ñska</p>
           </div>
<p>The recently discovered <a href="/Articles/782381/">vulnerability in
Thunderbolt</a> has restarted discussions about protecting the kernel
against untrusted, hotpluggable hardware. That vulnerability, known as <a
href="http://thunderclap.io/">Thunderclap</a>, allows a hostile external
device to exploit <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_memory_management_unit">Input-Output
Memory Management Unit (IOMMU)</a> mapping limitations and access system
memory it was not intended to.  Thunderclap can be exploited by
USB-C-connected devices; while we have seen USB attacks in the past, this
vulnerability is different in that PCI devices, often considered as
trusted, can be a source of attacks too.  One way of stopping those attacks
would be to make sure that the IOMMU is used correctly and restricts the device
to accessing the memory that was allocated for it. Lu Baolu has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190327063506.32564-1-baolu.lu%40linux.intel.com/">posted
an implementation of that approach</a> in the form of bounce buffers for
untrusted devices. 

<h4>PCI and untrusted devices</h4>

<p>PCI devices are usually built into the system, there was not much
concern about them going rogue (however, a reader <a
href="/Articles/783485/">expressed concerns in the comments</a> on 
an LWN article about peer-to-peer PCI accesses). The PCI bus does support
hotplugging, but its use is limited. It is, however, possible to attach
external PCI devices to a bus like Thunderbolt. That opens the door to the
Thunderclap 
vulnerability; a rogue device can benefit from the fact that the
PCI bus is, in practice, more trusted than externally accessible buses.</p>

<p>The PCI bus does not have uncontrolled access to the system, though, on
systems where an IOMMU exists and is in use.  It allows (or denies) access by
devices to specific memory regions and maps bus addresses to physical
memory addresses. The IOMMU works at the page level, and the remapped
regions must 
be set explicitly before use; each device has different regions it can
access. However, not all systems have an IOMMU enabled (or even installed)
because of performance concerns or functionality that does not work
correctly with the IOMMU.</p>

<p>
One step toward improving the situation is to keep track of which devices
are expected to behave well and which might not.
The marking of trusted and untrusted PCI devices <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/acpi/property.c?h=v5.1-rc3&id=617654aae50eb59dd98aa53fb562e850937f4cde">was
added</a> in December 2018. It is done with an <tt>untrusted</tt> flag
added to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1-rc3/source/include/linux/pci.h#L287"><tt>struct
pci_dev</tt></a> to control special handling of such devices, including
full IOMMU 
mapping and functions like the bounce buffers. A PCI device is
marked untrusted if the firmware marks its root port as external
(currently only if the <tt>ExternalFacingPort</tt> ACPI property is set);
that should be the case for Thunderbolt devices.</p>

<h4>IOMMU constraints</h4>

<p>Trusted PCI devices are expected to perform their DMA operations to and
from the buffers 
they have been given to use; they do not run out of bounds or access other
memory zones. With such devices, the IOMMU configuration code can take some
shortcuts and, for example,
map slightly bigger zones to fit hardware limitations and optimize IOMMU
usage. For untrusted devices, we cannot make the same assumptions; the
correct and strict configuration of the IOMMU becomes more important.
Unfortunately, the minimum granularity of the (Intel) IOMMU is 4KB.
Mapping a buffer with the IOMMU means allowing access to the whole 4KB
page, even if 
the desired zone is smaller.
<p>
One result of this limitation is that an unaware driver that
allocates a small buffer for  device DMA and maps it through the IOMMU exposes
the whole page with all of the other data it may contain, even if it belongs to
other drivers or to the kernel itself. The fact that this situation does not
cause any runtime error could be considered a weak point of the DMA API.
Just activating the IOMMU doesn't solve the problem &mdash; the system must
also take care to not place any unrelated data in the memory mapped by the
IOMMU.

<h4>Bounce buffers</h4>

<p>This is where the proposed patch set comes into play. It implements 
bounce buffers for the untrusted devices; a bounce buffer is simply a
separate memory area that is used for DMA operations.  Data is copied
("bounced") between the original buffer and the bounce buffer, which is
located in isolated memory that can be
mapped by the IOMMU in such a way that there is no access to the data
outside the buffer in question.
<p>
If the original buffer covers a full page (or
multiple full pages), nothing needs to change as this buffer can be
directly mapped 
without exposing any unrelated data. If, instead, the buffer is inside a
page that 
may contain other data, bounce buffers will be used.
During the 
mapping, unmapping, and sync operations, the code will copy the data from
the original buffer to the bounce buffer and back, depending on the
direction of the transfer. Then the IOMMU uses the bounce-buffer addresses
for the device instead of the original one.</p>

<p>When an I/O operation is set up, the original I/O
buffer is split into three parts: "low", "middle", and
"high". The low and high parts might lay on pages that may
contain other data: they are the first and the last page that
contains the device buffers. The middle pages contain only the
device buffer, so they do not use the bounce buffer; only the low and
high
pages do. This operation may thus split a single contiguous buffer into
three pieces; those pieces will be reunited (from the device's point of
view) in the IOMMU mapping.

<p>The bounce-buffer patch implements another change: the IOMMU
mapping is invalidated immediately after the unmap operation. If that
mapping stays
cached in the IOMMU, the device might still use it after the mapped page
has been reallocated for some other purpose. The patch
set also provides an option to deactivate the bounce buffers if the system
administrator trusts the attached devices.</p>

<h4>Similarity to swiotlb</h4>

<p>In the discussion following <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190312060005.12189-1-baolu.lu@linux.intel.com/">the
first version of the patch set</a>, Christoph Hellwig <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190312163845.GA13141@infradead.org/">noted</a>
that the code has similarities to the swiotlb (software input
output translation lookaside buffer) subsystem.  The swiotlb is a
bounce-buffering mechanism used with devices that cannot access all of a
system's memory.  In response, Lu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c1ffee0a-24d2-df53-0689-23b0d8ef065d@linux.intel.com/">tried
to make use of the swiotlb code</a>, but that effort failed because the
approach is somewhat different and the
offsets given by the swiotlb are different than the the original ones for
the low pages. This is because swiotlb copies the whole buffer,
rather than just the low and high segments,
during the mapping operation.</p>

<p>Robin Murphy <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/04703ea4-58e5-f833-5b39-1b68df2839ca@arm.com/">suggested</a>
that the implementation should be made generic for the whole IOMMU
subsystem and not limited to Intel VT-d only. The discussion continued
after the second version submission and Lu proposed an <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/04b41eb3-5584-5c7d-5f5e-7c6f28a19b50@linux.intel.com/">extension
to swiotlb</a>.
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190421011719.14909-1-baolu.lu@linux.intel.com/">A
new version</a> of the patch set was posted on April&nbsp;21.  It includes
a refactoring 
of the swiotlb and moves some of the driver-specific code to the generic
IOMMU layer.


<p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>The use of bounce buffers can protect a system against a class
of attacks. It remains an open question if there are more similar issues in
the kernel and if there will be a need to harden other in-kernel interfaces.
This is likely, as the threat model has completely changed &mdash; the
attacker now controls
the devices that were previously thought of as trusted. It seems certain that
we are going to see more attacks from rogue devices using unexpected
protocols. The kernel interfaces that were considered internal in the past
may need to be reviewed and hardened.</p>

<p>The implementation of the IOMMU bounce buffers is complete; one remaining
question is what the performance penalty is. The measurements of the
impact have not yet been submitted with the patch set. According to the
description, the impact is expected to be small. One may expect
that it should be lower than swiotlb since less data copying takes
place. Large transfers should not be 
affected as they are usually page-aligned already. The overhead will be
more visible for small transfers, where the setup will dominate the cost of
a small copy.</p>
<p>
The missing performance information, along with some other comments on the
latest posting of the patch set, suggest that there is still some work to
be done before this code is ready to go upstream.  With luck, though, it
shouldn't be too long before Linux systems have a higher level of
protection against untrustworthy devices.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There certainly are PCIe devices running firmware of very [1] questionable [2] quality that have network access. Can the MCUs generate arbitrary PCIe bus transactions? If so, I suppose they should also be marked untrusted? Is the untrusted property exposed in sysfs? Perhaps something like an udev rule that would mark net/wwan devices with non-free firmware (or at least known bad firmware) as untrusted would make sense?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; A PCI device is marked untrusted if the firmware marks its root port as external (currently only if the ExternalFacingPort ACPI property is set); that should be the case for Thunderbolt devices.</font><br>
<p>
Is this setting also done for removable NVMe SSD slots in storage servers? If not then one could envision someone with physical access to the server could remove a trusted NVMe SSD and insert something more malicious. There are already several NVMe form-factors and servers that can support hot plugging of new PCIe devices and many more are coming....<br>

Wouldn't such a scenario be kind of bye-bye anyway? Remote the root disk, replace it with one that has a replaced kernel or /etc/shadow or /bin/login or /bin/ssh or /bin/gpg or a gazillion other neat little backdoors.<br>

Doesn't having a bounce buffer rather defeat the purpose of DMA?  Is DMA via a bounce buffer faster than just plain copying the data in the processor's address space via normal mechanism?  Perhaps the answer is that devices that perform small transfers that need sub-page allocations also perform many large transfers for which DMA makes sense.<br>

There will be a performance hit certainly but I don't think it completely negates the advantages of DMA.<br>
<p>
As you say for large transfers the bounce buffer will only be used for the first and last partial pages.<br>
But, even without that if you read directly from the device it has to be word by word to/from the peripheral by the processor.<br>
Peripheral access is often slower than memory, due to wait states, uncached access, barriers etc.<br>
Peripherals designed for DMA use may also have faster DMA access than CPU access (that all depends on the bus interconnects).<br>
<p>
Furthermore even if the DMA is done to a bounce buffer that can be done quickly, potentially freeing the FIFO registers in the peripheral device for the next transfer while the CPU copies the first one.<br>

It's worth noting that the performance lost by not doing lazy invalidations of the TLBs may well be significant.  Shall we say, that 'optimization' is there for a reason.<br>

Why use a bounce-buffer instead of just ensuring that nothing shares the page of the regular buffer? It seems like you now have an "owned page" plus an additional copy.<br>

It could be a first step which doesn't require any modifications of the user code. Later user code could be modified to avoid the need of bounce buffers.<br>

coverage</a> on LWN.net.

The final session on Monday was concerned with documentation.  This
discussion was led by Michael Kerrisk, Randy Dunlap, and Jonathan Corbet.
Your editor started off with a survey of internal kernel API
documentation.  The in-kernel documentation directory, shipped with the
source code, contains much good
stuff, but it is disorganized and unmaintained.  Some of the treasures to be
found there include details on running Java binaries under the 1.3 kernel
and a discussion of the trials and tribulations of putting Linux on systems
with more than 16MB of memory.  The latter states:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There are some buggy motherboards which cannot properly deal with
	the memory above 16MB.  Consider exchanging your motherboard.
</div>
<p>
Linus stole your editor's punchline by noting that this file clearly
contains advice which is still good, so it should be retained.
<p>
Other sources of kernel API documentation include books - all of which are
currently obsolete.  There is also a fair amount of information available
on web sites, including this one.  A few questions were presented for
discussion, but what the developers really wanted to talk about was the
tools used to generate the KernelDoc documents.  These tools are effective,
but very slow, and they lack the ability to express everything of interest
about a given interface.  Your editor got the impression that, if the
KernelDoc tools were improved, much of the documentation problem would
simply go away.  Who knew it was so easy?
<p>

The second half of the session was led by Michael Kerrisk, who has been
putting a great deal of time into improving the kernel man pages
distribution.  These pages are the primary documentation of the kernel
user-space API, and they have seen a relatively low level of attention for
some time.  The networking pages, for example, cover the 2.2 version of the
interface.
<p>
The man-pages distribution contains over 800 pages.  Despite the time that
Michael has put in, he is having a hard time keeping up with the changes
being made by the kernel developers.  The writing work is hard enough on
its own, but, even before then, Michael must watch the patch stream and
notice that API changes have been made.  It would be nice if there were a
better way.

<p>

Michael talked about various approaches to improving the maintenance of the man
pages.  These include getting other maintainers to help out (by, at a
minimum, calling attention to API changes), paying a
writer to do the work, or requiring kernel developers to write man pages
for any APIs they add.  While the last one might seem like a good idea,
Linus made the claim that "a lot of kernel developers have huge problems
communicating with humans."  Forcing them to write documentation might not
be in anybody's best interest.

<p>

So the creation of kernel documentation is likely to remain a task
performed by a relatively small group of people.  OSDL is currently
considering a proposal to fund a writer for a fixed period; if that
proposal goes through, we may see kernel documentation coming out at a
higher rate.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The user-space kernel headers semi-automatically maintained by David Woodhouse may prove useful here. One hopes that a large part of the job of spotting API changes would be done by spying on the commit stream for this project, given that commits only happen when the user-space ABI changes, and that every ABI change should have a corresponding autocommit to this tree.<br>
<p>
(Well, every ABI change other than changes in the layout of filesystems such as sysfs...)<br>

Which is why we have people called "editors". The developers don't need to write brilliant documentation. As long as they can succinctly and clearly describe the interface, some time later someone can come along and make it readable for normal people.

      Manual pages .. I hold them dear. In what source format are they generated?  I seem to recall they are DocBook manpages. When it comes to sucking out all life and joy DocBook manpages easily beat any quantity of deatheaters. (which, as a mere aside, is why I wrote the somewhat grandiloquently named <a href="http://micans.org/pud/">PUD</a>).

the change be filed as a ticket against the affected manpages.<br>

<i>OSDL is currently considering a proposal to fund a writer for a fixed period</i>

<p>
Specifically, it is the Technical Advisory Board (made up of kernel community members) considering the proposal.  IIRC, the roadblock presently is receiving funding that was pledged by various companies when the TAB was set up.

      <p>I find documentation to be a great final step in the development of code. I have frequently made improvements to my code (especially to interfaces) as a result of trying to write documentation. <b>If you can't document it easily then it's broken</b> (the truth of this statement varies from domain to domain but I think it's a good first approximation).</p>

<p>Ideally that sort of stuff would be found in my design documentation but I (like many others) am merely mortal and get a bit too excited about bashing out code to write a detailed designed beforehand.</p>

<h1>Multi-size THP creation, two different ways</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">

Huge pages can increase the performance of many programs, but they can also
have unfortunate performance impacts of their own.  Over the last few
years, multi-size transparent huge pages (mTHPs) have increasingly been
seen as a happy medium that bring the benefits of huge pages at a lower cost.
The system cannot benefit from mTHPs, though, if it does not create them;
two developers have independently posted patches to enable the creation of
mTHPs in the background.
<p>
<h4>Huge pages</h4>
<p>
Huge pages are a feature that is implemented by the CPU and its
memory-management unit; they enable the system to run with a mix of page
sizes.  Those sizes, though, are limited in number and entirely defined by
the CPU's memory architecture; they correspond to the levels of the
page-table hierarchy.  As a reminder, that hierarchy looks vaguely like this
diagram (from <a href="/Articles/568076/">this 2013 article</a>):
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/address-translation.png" width=673 class="photo"
alt="[Virtual address translation]">
</blockquote>
<p>

(More recent systems can also have <a href="/Articles/717293/">yet another
level</a> below the top of the hierarchy).
<p>
On x86 systems, the base-page size is 4KB.  The
first level of huge pages is implemented by marking the entry in the page
middle directory (PMD) level of the hierarchy — the one just above the
bottom page-table entry (PTE) level.  The PMD entry then refers directly to
a page covering a larger part of the address space rather than to the PTE
table.  That results in a page size of 2MB;
these pages are often referred to as "PMD huge pages".  Moving up to the
next level directory (the page upper directory, or PUD) yields 1GB huge
pages.
<p>
Huge pages that are implemented this way have some significant benefits.  A
single PMD huge page replaces 512 base pages, significantly reducing the
overhead of memory management and the number of page faults the system must
handle.  It also frees
as many as 512 entries in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), a scarce
processor resource that can often be a performance bottleneck.  As a
result, programs using huge pages can run more quickly.  Initially, use
of huge pages required special effort on the part of both the developer and
the system administrator; the <a href="/Articles/423584/">addition of
transparent huge pages (THPs)</a> in 2011 enabled the kernel to coalesce
(or "collapse") a process's base pages into huge pages behind the scenes,
making the performance benefits of huge pages available system-wide.
<p>
Unfortunately, huge pages are not entirely free.  The cost of huge-page use
can be internal fragmentation; if a process only uses part of a huge page,
the rest of it is simply wasted.  Enabling transparent huge pages can, as a
result, significantly increase the memory use of a workload; if a system
was running close to its limits without huge pages, turning them on can
push it over the edge.  For that reason, distributors have often left the
feature disabled, and one can easily find advice on the net to leave it
that way.

<p>
<h4>The multi-size option</h4>
<p>
Multi-size THPs are, as the name would suggest, an extension of the
huge-page concept to more sizes — those that do not correspond to the
page-table hierarchy.  The mTHP concept was enabled by the <a
href="/Articles/849538/">transition to folios</a> as a way of managing
memory in the kernel; now it is possible to represent groups of physically
contiguous pages of arbitrary (though power-of-two) sizes.  Use of mTHPs
will, once again, reduce memory-management overhead since they can be
managed as a unit rather than as independent base pages.  More recent CPUs
have added TLB-coalescing features that allow an eight (x86) or
16-page (Arm) mTHP to be represented a single TLB entry, increasing
the performance benefit that mTHPs can bring.
<p>
Using mTHPs can thus bring much of the performance improvement seen with
traditional huge pages, but with a lower internal-fragmentation
cost.  It is also much easier for the kernel to allocate an mTHP than a
full PMD or PUD huge page, especially after the system has been operating
for a while and memory has become fragmented.  It is thus not surprising
that a fair amount of effort has gone into improving the kernel's ability
to use mTHPs in recent years.
<p>
The THP page mechanism can inject huge pages into
a process's address space in a couple of ways.  One of those is when the
pages are initially allocated.  Rather than satisfying a page fault with a
base page, the kernel can allocate a huge page and read all of the contents
in a single operation, for example.  The other is to examine a process's
address space in the background and identify ranges of virtually contiguous
pages that could be replaced with huge pages.  When such a range is found,
a huge page is allocated, the base pages are copied into it, then freed
after the huge page replaces them in the page tables.  This latter task is
performed by the <tt>khugepaged</tt> kernel thread, which benefits from
being able to observe which pages of memory a process is actually using.
The <tt>khugepaged</tt> thread, though, can only create PMD huge pages; it
predates mTHPs and does not create them.  The two patch sets in question
are both aimed at filling in that gap.
<p>
Before looking into them, there is
one other bit of useful background relevant to both approaches.  There is a
sysctl knob, <tt>max_ptes_none</tt>, that controls how many new pages
<tt>khugepaged</tt> can allocate to create a huge page.  If, for example, a
suitable range of address space contains 500 active pages,
<tt>khugepaged</tt> would have to allocate 12&nbsp;more pages to have the
full 512 that make up a PMD huge page.  If <tt>max_pte_none</tt> is set to
at least&nbsp;12, <tt>khugepaged</tt> will proceed, otherwise it will give
up on that huge page.  Creating mTHPs in <tt>khugepaged</tt> increases the
amount of thought that must be put into this knob's setting.

<p>
<h4>Improving <tt>khugepaged</tt></h4>
<p>
The <a href="/ml/all/20250211003028.213461-1-npache@redhat.com">first patch
set</a>, from Nico Pache, changes the core <tt>khugepaged</tt> scanning
loop (called <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.14-rc2/source/mm/khugepaged.c#L1267"><tt>hpage_collapse_scan_pmd()</tt></a>
in current kernels, though the series renames it to
<tt>khugepaged_scan_pmd()</tt>).  The current implementation will stop
scanning a candidate huge page immediately if <tt>max_pte_none</tt>
unmapped pages are found.  In the modified version, instead, it will scan
the entire address range for the huge page regardless and create a bitmap
marking the places where an mTHP could be created within that page.  The
smallest size considered is order&nbsp;3 (eight pages); that may change to
allow an order&nbsp;4 minimum on Arm systems in the future, matching the
size at which TLB entries can be coalesced.
<p>
When determining whether a given mTHP-size chunk could be turned into an
actual mTHP, the patch scales the <tt>max_pte_none</tt> value accordingly.
When looking at an eight-page chunk, <tt>max_pte_none</tt> will be divided
by&nbsp;64 (512/8) to determine how many pages must actually be present.
<p>
After a PMD has been scanned, <tt>khugepaged</tt> will first consider
whether the whole thing can be turned into a PMD huge page.  Failing that,
the bitmap created during the scan will be consulted in an attempt to
create the largest mTHPs possible given the pages that are actually
resident in memory.  Once the bitmap has been processed and any mTHPs
created, <tt>khugepaged</tt> will move on to the next PMD to scan.
<p>
There is one problem with this approach that both patch sets must address;
it has been called "creep".  Imagine that <tt>max_pte_none</tt> has been
set to&nbsp;511, which happens to be its default value.  At that setting,
even a single resident page is enough to cause <tt>khugepaged</tt> to
populate the rest of a huge page, which may well be what the user wants.
Things change a bit when dealing with mTHPs, though.  When a PMD is
scanned, each single page will lead to the creation of an eight-page mTHP,
as expected.  The next time the scan happens, though, those mTHPs will each
be turned into 16-page mTHPs, since each contains enough pages to cause
<tt>khugepaged</tt> to bump them up to the next size.
<p>
Over time, these mTHPs will all "creep" up to the PMD size, which is just
the result that the patch set was created to avoid.  To keep this from
happening, administrators will need to set <tt>max_pte_none</tt> to a value
that is less than half of the PMD huge page size — a value of 255 or
smaller.
<p>
The <a href="/ml/all/20250211111326.14295-1-dev.jain@arm.com">second patch
series</a>, from Dev Jain, takes a slightly different approach.
<tt>khugepaged</tt> begins by scanning in PMD-sized chunks as before, but
if it is unable to collapse a given PMD range, it drops down to a smaller
order and tries again.  The <a
href="/ml/all/20250211111326.14295-8-dev.jain@arm.com">code implementing
this algorithm</a>, being a mass of <tt>goto</tt> statements, is a bit hard
to follow, but the intent is to scan each range of memory at the size that
results in successful mTHP creation.  Once a PMD entry has been completed, the
order is reset to the maximum to start the next one.
<p>
This series takes a stricter approach to the creep problem; it will only
perform mTHP collapse if <tt>max_ptes_none</tt> is set to either zero
or&nbsp;511.  In the former case, mTHPs will only be created if all of the
base pages it would replace are already present; in the latter case, creep
up to the full PMD size is explicitly allowed.
<p>
Pache posted <a
href="/ml/all/20250211004054.222931-1-npache@redhat.com">another patch
set</a> that could conceivably be used with either of the
<tt>khugepaged</tt> mTHP implementations.  In current kernels, mTHPs of
various sizes can be explicitly enabled or disabled by way of a set of
sysctl knobs (documented in <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html#sysfs"><tt>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</tt></a>).
The setting of <tt>always</tt> causes the kernel to try to create
mTHPs of that size, while <tt>never</tt> disables that size.  Pache adds a
new setting of <tt>defer</tt> that will cause the kernel to <i>not</i> use
the given size in response to page faults, but <i>will</i> allow
<tt>khugepaged</tt> to collapse to that size.  The purpose here is to limit
mTHP allocations to memory where it has been shown to be useful, hopefully
further reducing the costs of mTHP usage while enjoying their benefits.
<p>
Both of these patch sets are freshly posted as of this writing; neither has
yet generated any real review discussion beyond <a
href="/ml/all/20250211152341.3431089327c5e0ec6ba6064d@linux-foundation.org">a
request</a> for benchmark results from Andrew Morton.  So there is no way
to predict which (if either) of the patch sets will be accepted, or how
much change may be needed before that can happen.  There is a clear desire
to make better use of mTHPs, though, so the goal behind this work is easy
enough to understand; sooner or later, the kernel will almost certainly gain
some sort of ability to create mTHPs in the background while a process is
running.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

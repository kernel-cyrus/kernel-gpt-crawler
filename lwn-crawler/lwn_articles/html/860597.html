It has been well over three years now since <a href="/Articles/742702/">the
Spectre hardware 
vulnerabilities were disclosed</a>, but Spectre is truly a gift that keeps on
giving.  Writing correct and secure code is hard enough when the hardware
behaves in predictable ways; the problem gets far worse when processors can
do random and crazy things.  For an illustration of the challenges
involved, one need look no further than the BPF vulnerability described in
<a
href="/ml/oss-security/CAHMfzJkhZ01FG62sfMdXayK_NwD3g=5NcpGmg+-PVZLBpjJ9Fw@mail.gmail.com/">this
advisory</a>, which was fixed in the 5.13-rc7 release.
<p>
Attacks on Spectre vulnerabilities generally rely on convincing the
processor to execute, in a speculative mode, a sequence of operations that
cannot happen in real execution.  A classic example is an out-of-range
array reference, even though the code performs a proper bounds check.  The
erroneous access will be backed out once the processor figures out that it
mispredicted the result of the bounds check, but the speculative access
will leave traces in the memory caches that can be used to exfiltrate
data. 
<p>
The BPF virtual machine has always been an area of special concern when it
comes to defending against speculative-execution attacks.  Most such
attacks rely on finding a fragment of kernel code that can be made to do
surprising things when the CPU is executing speculatively; 
kernel developers duly have made a concerted effort to eliminate such fragments.
But BPF exists to enable the loading of code from user space that runs
within the kernel context; that allows attackers to craft their own code
fragments and avoid the tedious task of combing through the kernel code.
<p>
Much work has been done in the BPF community to frustrate those attackers.
For example, array indexes are ANDed with a bitmask so that they cannot
reach outside of 
the array even speculatively, regardless of what value they may contain.
But it can be hard to anticipate every case where the processor may do
something surprising.
<p>
<h4>The vulnerability</h4>
<p>
Consider, for example, the following fragment of code, taken directly from
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/patch/?id=9183671af6dbf60a1219371d4ed73e23f43b49db">this
commit</a> by Daniel Borkmann fixing this vulnerability:
<p>
<pre>
    // r0 = pointer to a map array entry
    // r6 = pointer to readable stack slot
    // r9 = scalar controlled by attacker
    1: r0 = *(u64 *)(r0) // cache miss
    2: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 4
    3: r6 = r9
    4: if r0 != 0x1 goto line 6
    5: r9 = *(u8 *)(r6)
    6: // leak r9
</pre>
<p>
Incidentally, the changelog for this patch is an outstanding example of how
to document a vulnerability and its fix; it's worth reading in full.
<p>
In normal (non-speculative) execution, the above code has a potential problem.
The register <tt>r9</tt> contains an attacker-supplied value; that value is
assigned to <tt>r6</tt> in line&nbsp;3, which is then used as a pointer in
line&nbsp;5.  That value could point anywhere in the kernel's address
space; this is just the sort of unconstrained access that the BPF verifier
was designed to prevent, so one might think that this code would never be
accepted by the kernel in the first place.
<p>
The verifier, though, works by exploring all of the possible paths that
execution of a BPF program could take.  In this case, there is no possible
path that executes both lines&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;5.  The assignment of the
attacker-supplied pointer only happens if <tt>r0</tt> contains zero, but
that value will prevent the execution of line&nbsp;5.  The verifier thus
concludes that there is no path that can result in the indirection of a
user-supplied pointer and allows the program to be loaded.
<p>
But that verification runs in the real world; different rules apply in the
speculative world.
<p>
Line&nbsp;1 in the above code fragment references memory that an
attacker will have taken pains to ensure is not currently cached, forcing a
cache miss.  Rather than wait for memory to fetch the value, though, the
processor will continue speculatively, making guesses about how any
conditional statements involving <tt>r0</tt> will play out.  And those
guesses, as it turns out, could well be that neither <tt>if</tt> condition
(in line&nbsp;2 or&nbsp;4) will evaluate true and, thus, neither jump will
be taken.
<p>
How can that be?  Branch prediction doesn't work by guessing a value for
<tt>r0</tt> and checking the result; it is, instead, based on what the
recent history of that particular branch has been.  That history is stored in
the CPU's "pattern history table" (PHT).  But the CPU cannot possibly track
every branch instruction in a large program, so the PHT takes the form of a
hash table.  An attacker can locate code in such a way that its branches
land in the same PHT entries as the branches in the crafted BPF program,
then use that code to train the branch predictor to make the desired
guesses.
<p>
Once the attacker has loaded the code, cleared out the caches, and fooled
the branch predictor into doing silly things, the battle is over; the
CPU will speculatively reference the attacker-supplied address.  Then it's
just a matter of leaking the results in any of the usual ways.  It is a bit
of a tedious process — but computers are good at following such processes
without complaining.
<p>
It is worth noting that this is not a hypothetical attack.  According to
the advisory, multiple proofs-of-concept were sent to the
<tt>security@kernel.org</tt> list when this problem was reported.  Some of
them do not require the step of 
training the branch predictor (one such is provided in the above-linked
commit).  These attacks can read out any memory
in the kernel's address space; given that all of physical memory is
contained therein, there are no real limits to what can be exfiltrated.
Since unprivileged users can load a few types BPF programs, root access is
not needed to carry out this attack.  This is, in other words, a serious
vulnerability. 
<p>
<h4>Closing the hole</h4>
<p>
The fix in this case is relatively straightforward.  Rather than prune
paths that the verifier "knows" will not be executed, the verifier will
simulate them speculatively.  So, for example, when checking the path where
<tt>r0</tt> is zero, the unfixed verifier would simply conclude that the
test in line&nbsp;4 must be true and not consider the alternative.  With
the fix, the verifier will look at the false path (which includes
line&nbsp;5), conclude that an unknown
pointer is being used, and prevent the loading of the program.
<p>
This change has the potential to block the loading of correct programs that
could be run before, though it is hard to imagine real-world, non-malicious
code that would include this kind of pattern.  It will, of course, slow the
verification process to force it to examine paths that cannot occur in
normal program execution, but that's the speculative world we live in.
<p>
This fix was merged into the mainline and can be found in the 5.13-rc7
release.  It has since found its way into the 5.12.13 and 5.10.46 stable
updates, but not (yet) into any of the earlier stable releases.  With this
change, those kernels are protected against yet another Spectre
vulnerability, but it would be foolhardy to assume that this is the last
one.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

With chromium Google gave up on protecting against Spectre exploits via JS and focus instead on using separated processes for protection.<br>
<p>
Now, BPF VM is much simpler than JS one, so I guess the assumption is that all Spectre bugs can be worked around. Still given that the message from hardware designers is to use a separated address space for protection the long term status of BPF is rather fragile.<br>

What I find worrying is that BPF is selected by NET. I can understand that some people need it, but the rest of us have to go along for the ride. Now sure, just enabling BPF on its own doesn&#x27;t mean it gets used, but I dislike having to enable soemthing I have no intention  of using (the initial Spectre reports suggested it might apply to AMD when BPF was in use).<br>

I become a fan of ebpf after I found that systems can restrict services to a given list of ips without invoking ip/nftables. It&#x27;s the most simple and the most straightforward use of ebpf, returning back to it orgins. The great change here is that those rules are per service (as systemd define it, using cgroups, and so on). So those rules does not require any global cooperations, and they are automatically inherited by subprocesses, restarted services, helper pre/post scripts.<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s just so natural and amazing, that I can&#x27;t imagine returning back to boring iptables days.<br>

Even if BPF VM is rather simple, the verification of program safety is still a hard problem in general.<br>
<p>
So we got a whole series of Spectre vulnerabilities reported this year in BPF. Apart from Spectre, a few local privilege escalation vulnerabilities have also been discovered in the verifier.<br>
<p>
The BPF flexibility helps a lot when exploiting these vulnerabilities. This is based on my own experience preparing reproducers that were included in a number of these vulnerability reports, including the one discussed in this article.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, unprivileged BPF can be disabled on any systems that don&#x27;t require it. This blocks typical exploitation.<br>

      Unreachable code is indeed overwritten now. But there is no unreachable code in the exploit described in the article.

I wonder whether alternative verifiers (such as the one used by the BPF for Windows folk) are vulnerable to similar issues.<br>

The Windows verifier runs in user space and uses a verification technique that is very different from the Linux implementation.<br>

Which doesn&#x27;t answer the question: does it accept the kind of code provided in the article? I.e is it vulnerable to this exploit?<br>

Just out of curiosity: How can the verifier run in user space? How can the kernel be certain that the program loaded was correctly verified? <br>

From <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2021/05/10/making-ebpf-work-on-windows/">https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2021/05/10/ma...</a> :<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The library sends the eBPF bytecode to a static verifier (the PREVAIL verifier) that is hosted in a user-mode protected process, which is a Windows security environment that allows a kernel component to trust a user-mode daemon signed by a key that it trusts.</font><br>
<p>
Sounds like protected processes were originally for media DRM, then were made more general-purpose for use by third-party anti-malware services. The certificate is provided by a kernel driver (so it&#x27;s protected the same way as installing any kernel driver), and then the protected process can only load EXEs/DLLs that are signed with that certificate or are Windows system DLLs. The kernel also blocks other processes from injecting code or modifying virtual memory of the protected process.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 24, 2007</br>
           </div>
An interrupt handler is the portion of a device driver which is charged
with responding to interrupts from the hardware; at a minimum it should
shut the hardware up and initiate any processing which needs to be
performed. 
When your editor worked on the second edition of <i>Linux Device
Drivers</i>, the prototype for interrupt handlers looked like this:
<p>
<pre>
    void handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs);
</pre>
<p>
The kernel development process is not particularly kind to book authors
who, as a rule, prefer to see the ink dry on their creations before the
text becomes obsolete.  True to form, the handler prototype has changed a
couple of times since LDD2, with the result that the 2.6.23 version looks
like:
<p>
<pre>
    irqreturn_t handler(int irq, void *dev_id);
</pre>
<p>
Along the way, interrupt handlers gained a return type (used to tell the
kernel whether an interrupt was actually processed or not) and lost the
processor registers argument.  One would think that this interface (along
with those who attempt to document it) had suffered enough, but, it seems,
there will be no rest in the near future.
<p>
In particular, Jeff Garzik has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/255414/">proposed that the <tt>irq</tt>
argument be removed</a> from the interrupt handler prototype.  There are
very few interrupt handlers which actually use that argument currently.
And, as it turns out, most of the remaining handlers do not actually need
it; they are often using the interrupt number to identify the interrupting
device, but the <tt>dev_id</tt> pointer already exists for just that
purpose.  Still, getting this patch into the kernel would require a
significant amount of work, since every in-tree interrupt handler will have
to be audited and fixed up.
<p>

So Jeff is taking it slowly; this is not a patch set which is aimed at
being merged for 2.6.24.  Before it goes in, there is room for a lot of
useful work cleaning up the current use of the <tt>irq</tt> argument in
drivers, all of which would ease the eventual transition to the new call.
Handlers which really need the IRQ number can call the new
<tt>get_irqfunc_irq()</tt> function.  But, <a href="/Articles/255538/">says
Jeff</a>, "<q>I am finding a ton of bugs in each get_irqfunc_irq()
driver, so I would rather patiently sift through them, and push fixes and
cleanups upstream.</q>"  Quite a few interrupt handler fixes resulting
from this work have already been posted.
<p>

Eric Biederman worries that converting all of the drivers could be a
challenge; he has <a href="/Articles/255539/">posted a proposal</a> which
would create two different interrupt registration and handler interfaces,
allowing drivers which really need the IRQ number to continue to
receive it.  Jeff is confident that the extra structure will not be
necessary, though.  Thomas Gleixner, instead, <a
href="/Articles/255541/">would like to see the patches merged
immediately</a>, but it is almost certain that this patch set will be given
one more development cycle to mature before going into the mainline.
<p>

Alexey Dobriyan, meanwhile, would like to fix up the interrupt-safe
spinlock interface.  Most code which requires a spinlock in the presence of
interrupts calls:
<p>
<pre>
    void spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> variable is used by the (architecture-specific) code to
save any interrupt state which may be needed when
<tt>spin_unlock_irqrestore()</tt> is called.  The problem with this
interface is that it is not particularly type-safe.  Developers have been
known to use an <tt>int</tt> type instead of <tt>unsigned long</tt>; that
usage will generate no errors and it will work fine on the x86
architecture.  It will, however, fail in ugly ways on some other
architectures.  
<p>

So Alexey would like to turn <tt>flags</tt> into a new type
(<tt>irq_flags_t</tt>).  This type would initially be defined to be
<tt>unsigned long</tt>, so the change would not break compilation.  It
would be annotated, though, so that the <tt>sparse</tt> utility could
point out all of the places where <tt>spin_lock_irqsave()</tt> is called
with an incorrect type.  In the more distant future, when the changeover is
complete, architecture maintainers would be able to redefine the type to
whatever works best on their systems, be it a structure or a single byte.  
<p>
Andrew Morton had <a href="/Articles/255547/">a mixed response</a> to the
patch:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Yes, it's always been ugly that we use unsigned long for this
	rather than abstracting it properly.
<p>
	However I'd prefer that we have some really good reason for
	introducing irq_flags_t now.  Simply so that I don't needlessly
	spend the next two years wrestling with literally thousands of
	convert-to-irq_flags_t patches and having to type "please use
	irq_flags_t here" in hundreds of patch reviews.
</div>
<p>
As an alternative, it was suggested that most calls of
<tt>spin_lock_irqsave()</tt> should be changed to <tt>spin_lock_irq()</tt>
instead.  The latter version disables interrupts without saving the
previous state; the accompanying <tt>spin_unlock_irq()</tt> call will then
unconditionally re-enable interrupts.  Those functions can be made to work,
but only if it is known that interrupts will not have already been disabled
when <tt>spin_lock_irq()</tt> is called.  Otherwise the
<tt>spin_unlock_irq()</tt> call risks enabling interrupts when some other
part of the kernel expects them to still be disabled.  The resulting random
behavior is generally seen as undesirable by most computer users.
So, in other words, <tt>spin_lock_irqsave()</tt> is a safer interface,
which is why there is not a great deal of support for removing it.  The
prospect of well-intentioned kernel janitors changing code to
<tt>spin_lock_irq()</tt> without really understanding the broader context
is just too scary.
<p>

Finally, there was a discussion involving <tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> which
illustrates just how hard it can be to get a handle on race conditions on
multiprocessor systems.  This function:
<p>
<pre>
    void synchronize_irq(unsigned int irq);
</pre>
<p>
is intended to help coordinate actions between a driver's interrupt and
non-interrupt code.  At its core, it is a simple loop:
<p>
<pre>
    while (desc-&gt;status &amp; IRQ_INPROGRESS)
	cpu_relax();
</pre>
<p>
In other words, <tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> will busy-wait until it is known
that no handlers are running for the given interrupt.  The idea is that any
interrupt handler which might have been running before the call to
<tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> will have completed when that function returns.
The typical usage pattern is something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    some_important_flag = a_new_value;
    synchronize_irq();
    /* Code which depends on IRQ handler seeing a_new_value here */
</pre>
<p>
With code like this, after the <tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> call, any
interrupt handler will be guaranteed to see <tt>a_new_value</tt> - or so
people think.
<p>
The problem is that contemporary processors will happily reorder memory
operations to avoid pipeline stalls and improve performance; the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/">what every programmer should know
about memory series</a> currently being serialized by LWN describes these
issues in detail.  What is relevant here is that the change to
<tt>some_important_flag</tt> might be reordered (delayed) such that it does
not become visible to other processors
on the system until sometime after <tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> returns.
During the window when the change is not visible, the promise of
<tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> is not kept - an interrupt handler could run and
see the old value, possibly creating mayhem as a result.  That is the sort
of obscure, one-in-a-billion race 
condition which keeps kernel hackers up at night.
<p>
Actually, kernel hacking and coffee keep kernel hackers up at night, but
your editor's point should be clear.
<p>

Benjamin Herrenschmidt, upon finding this race, <a
href="/Articles/255552/">attempted to fix it with a memory barrier</a>.
After some discussion, though, it became clear that the memory barrier was
not sufficient.  Barriers can affect the order in which operations become
visible, but they cannot, in the absence of corresponding
barriers on another processor, guarantee that a specific change becomes visible
to that processor at any given time.  That sort of guarantee requires the
use of a locked operation which forces synchronization between
processors - the sort of operation which is typically used to implement
spinlocks.
<p>
So the real solution appears to be <a href="/Articles/255553/">this
patch</a> by Linus Torvalds and Herbert Xu.  The <tt>while</tt> loop shown
above persists in the new version, and it continues to run with no locks
held - holding the interrupt descriptor lock when the interrupt subsystem
may want it could lead to deadlocks.  But, once it appears that no handlers
are running, the descriptor lock is acquired and the status is checked one
more time.  If no handlers are running, the synchronize operation is
complete; otherwise the code goes back to busy-waiting.  The acquisition of
the descriptor lock guarantees that memory barriers will have been executed
on both sides of any potential race condition; that, in turn, will force
the ordering of the memory operations.  So, with this change in place,
<tt>synchronize_irq()</tt> will truly synchronize with IRQ handlers and one
more difficult race condition will have been eliminated.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Actually, the "what every programmer should know about memory series" &lt;i&gt;hasn't&lt;/i&gt; described,
in detail, issues of modern processors' reordering of memory operations to avoid pipeline
stalls. Thus far, we have half-truths like, "All processors are supposed to see the same
memory content &lt;i&gt;at all times&lt;/i&gt;. The maintenance of this uniform view of memory is called
'cache coherency'.  (My emphasis)

I hope the series will come clean about what cache coherency really means, and what it takes,
in general, for two processors to "see the same memory content", and when one can hope they
will.

The BPF subsystem, which allows code to be loaded into the kernel from user
space and safely executed in the kernel context, is bound to create a number of
challenges for the kernel as a whole.  One might not think that allocating
memory for BPF programs would be high on the list of problems, but life
(and memory management) can be surprising.  The attempts to do a better job
of providing space for compiled BPF code have, to date, only been partially
successful; now Song Liu is back with <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20221107223921.3451913-1-song@kernel.org/">a new
approach</a> to finish the job.
<p>
<h4>Small, transient, and numerous</h4>
<p>
The problem with BPF programs is that they tend to be small, are often
transient, and can be numerous.  That, alone, would not be hard for the
kernel to deal with; the slab allocators are highly tuned for the efficient
allocation and freeing of small objects.  But BPF programs, being
executable code, must be stored in memory that allows execute access, and
that complicates the picture.
<p>
Any memory that is both executable and writable presents an attractive
target for attackers, so the kernel goes well out of its way to prevent
that combination from occurring; some architectures prohibit it entirely.
The kernel's own code is loaded at boot 
time, made read-only, and (usually) never changed again.  Loadable modules,
which require the addition of kernel code at run time,
complicate things a bit, but modules are relatively large and tend to be
stable.  The kernel will load the modules it needs shortly after boot, and
the set of loaded modules will rarely change thereafter.  As a result, even
if the handling of loadable modules is not optimal, things normally work
well enough anyway.
<p>
As noted above, though,
BPF programs can come and go frequently, and there can be a lot of
small programs in the system.  All of this would be fine in the
absence of the prohibition on memory that is both writable and executable;
that restriction requires that memory holding BPF programs, which are
executable, be made non-writable.  That, in turn,
requires changing the permissions in the "direct map", the range of kernel
address space that (on 64-bit systems) maps all of the system's physical
memory.  Even if direct-map addresses are not used to access BPF memory (as
would 
happen if the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> family of allocators is used to obtain
it), the existence of a writable direct mapping to executable code would
create a potential vulnerability.
<p>
The kernel's direct map uses huge-page mappings (of 1GB size when
possible).  Huge-page mappings reduce the pressure on the system's
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and improve the performance of the
system overall.  If a portion of the direct map must be made read-only,
though, then the huge page the contains it must be split into smaller
pages, fragmenting the direct map with a measurable impact on performance.
Doing that once or twice might not be a big problem but, in a system where
BPF programs come and go frequently, the impact on the direct map can be
severe.
<p>
The smallness of BPF programs also turns out to be a problem.  In older
kernels, each BPF program was loaded into its own (4KB) page, meaning that,
often, most of the page was wasted.  If many of these programs are loaded,
that wasted memory starts to add up.
<p>
In February, Liu <a href="/Articles/883454/">set out to solve these
problems</a>.  The "bpf_prog_pack" allocator worked by allocating 2MB huge
pages from the kernel, then handing out portions of those pages for BPF
programs as they 
are loaded.  The concentration of multiple BPF programs into huge pages
addressed both problems: it minimized fragmentation of the direct map and
reduced memory waste by packing BPF programs together in the same page.
This allocator looked like a good solution and was quickly pulled into the
mainline during the 5.18 merge window.
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="/Articles/892743/">a number of problems</a> quickly
surfaced, and much of the bpf_prog_pack functionality was backed out
despite the fact that the source of some of the trouble was to be found in
the memory-management subsystem.  The
allocator is still present in the kernel, but it uses 4KB "base" pages, so
it does not help performance as much as it could.
<p>
<h4>Trying again</h4>
<p>
Liu's new proposal replaces bpf_prog_pack with a new allocator that
addresses the complaints about the previous version and, once
again, uses huge pages to hold BPF programs.  That leads to improved
performance:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Based on our experiments, we measured 0.5% performance improvement
	from bpf_prog_pack. This patchset further boosts the improvement to
	0.7%.  The difference is because bpf_prog_pack uses 512x 4kB pages
	instead of 1x 2MB page.
</blockquote>
<p>
The use of 2MB pages is now possible as the result of fixing the
related problems in the memory-management subsystem.  This new allocator
goes beyond the use of huge pages, though, and creates a new API for the
management of transient, executable code in the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
    void *execmem_alloc(unsigned long size, unsigned long align);
    void *execmem_fill(void *dst, void *src, size_t len);
    void execmem_free(void *addr);
</pre>
<p>
Any kernel subsystem that needs to set up a segment of executable code can
allocate the memory with <tt>execmem_alloc()</tt>.  The memory that is
returned will have read-only protection, so the caller cannot copy the code
into it directly.  Instead, <tt>execmem_fill()</tt> must be called to
populate this memory with the executable text.  On the x86 architecture
(the only one that supports this mechanism now), the "text_poke" machinery
will be used to safely copy the code while dodging the many race conditions
that can present themselves when code is being modified.  If a range of
executable memory is no longer needed, it can be returned with
<tt>execmem_free()</tt>.
<p>
The advantage of this new API is that it is not limited to just BPF
programs; it can also potentially be used in other places where code is
loaded into the kernel â€” specifically for loadable modules.  That would
improve the efficiency of those allocations while simultaneously
reducing the number of code-loading implementations in the kernel.  That
seems like a significant benefit, but there is just one little problem: the
module loader has not been changed to actually use this API, so there is no
proof that it will work in that context.
<p>
Indeed, it almost certainly will not work for module loading yet, simply
because there is no support for any architectures other than x86.  Loading
code into a running kernel is a tricky business, and the details of how it
can be done safely vary widely from one architecture to the next.  A number
of architectures now implement at least parts of the text_poke API, which
simplifies the task, but text_poke is not universal; arm64 does not support
it, for example.  Architectures also have differing requirements around the
placement of data areas for modules; it may not work to put a module's BSS
memory far away from its text, for example.  All of this adds up to a
number of potential headaches for anybody trying to actually use the new
API for module loading.
<p>
Reviewers of this work would, understandably, like some assurance that the
new API can work beyond BPF before accepting it; Mike Rapoport, for
example, has <a href="/ml/linux-mm/Y2o9Iz30A3Nruqs4@kernel.org/">asked</a>
for "<q>at least some explanation how modules etc can use execmem_ APIs
without breaking !x86 architectures</q>".  Rick Edgecombe <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/9e59a4e8b6f071cf380b9843cdf1e9160f798255.camel@intel.com/">responded</a>
with an assertion that other architectures could be supported with minor
changes to the API, but questioned whether it it is truly necessary to
solve the whole problem at this point.
<p>
Luis Chamberlain has also <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/Y3P%2F9DXAjKhmoIvm@bombadil.infradead.org/">expressed
frustration</a> at the lack of solid (and reproducible) data showing how
this work improves system performance.  He clearly sees some advantages
overall, though, since one of his <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/Y2mXI1WHuhRW7Jt+@bombadil.infradead.org/">complaints</a>
is that the patch changelogs do not sufficiently highlight "<q>the gains of
this effort helping with the long term advantage of centralizing the
semantics for permissions on memory</q>".  Liu has <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAPhsuW4_aYvPJUfCBkMygKPpHx7Y3xPCV7ewLGGAhyztJq3dhA@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
with a bit more data on TLB-miss improvement.
<p>
The benefits of the work seem clear, should it manage to not run
into surprises like its predecessor.  The biggest question with regard to
merging would seem to be just how much work will be required to convince
reviewers that this API can handle the module case.  If a complete solution
is required, the new BPF program allocator seems unlikely to land anytime
soon.  Since there are no user-space API issues to resolve, though, it
should be possible to proceed with the BPF solution once reviewers are
convinced that it does not actively lead in the wrong direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just for people who find this via google, the debate has now evolved to the point where tglx has NACK'd this patch without a solution to the broader executable memory allocation that would cover modules and more:<br>

Note that BPF on older ARM kernels does run into odd allocation location behaviors due to the use of the kernel's module_alloc infrastructure and is tough to write kernel modules around. Thankfully, recent efforts by Mark Rutland on v6.4-rc3 have led to kernel module comprehensible memory allocation locations for BPF programs on ARM!<br>

<p>
Anyone who follows Linux kernel security discussions has probably heard of
the "LSM stacking issue".  It is a perennial topic on the mailing lists and
solutions have been proposed from time to time.  The basic problem is that
only one Linux Security Module (LSM) can be active in a running kernel, and
that single slot is often occupied by one of the "monolithic" solutions
(e.g. SELinux or AppArmor) supplied by distributions.  That leaves some of
the smaller or more special-purpose LSMs&mdash;or users who want to use
multiple approaches&mdash;out in the cold.
</p>

<p>
Back in February 2011, David Howells <a href="/Articles/426921/">proposed
a stacking solution</a> for LSMs.  At the time, Casey Schaufler mentioned a
solution he had been working on that would be posted in a "day or two".
That 
prediction turns out to have been overly optimistic, but his <a href="/Articles/516650/">solution</a>
has surfaced&mdash;more than a year-and-a-half later.  He also discussed the patches in a lightning talk at the
recently held Linux Security Summit.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of LSMs available in the kernel today and there are
use cases for combining them in various ways.  Administrators might want to
add some AppArmor restrictions on top of the distribution-supplied SELinux
configuration&mdash;or use SELinux-based sandboxes on a TOMOYO
system. The two "labeled" LSMs, 
SELinux and Smack, require that files have extended attributes (xattrs)
containing labels that are used for access decisions.  The two "path-based"
LSMs, AppArmor and TOMOYO, both base their access decisions on the paths
used to access
files in the system.  The only other LSM currently available is Yama, which
is something of a container for discretionary access control (DAC)
enhancements.
</p>

<p>
Yama is the LSM that is perhaps most likely to be stacked.  It adds some
restrictions to the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> attach operation that Ubuntu and ChromeOS use, and other
distributions are considering it as well.  In fact, Yama developer Kees
Cook has <a href="/Articles/514975/">proposed</a> making the LSM
unconditionally stackable via the <tt>CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA_STACKED</tt>
kernel build option (which was merged for 3.7).  Over the years, though,
various other security ideas 
have been proposed and pointed in the direction of the LSM API, so other
targeted LSMs may come about down the road.  Making each separately
stackable is less than ideal, so a more general solution is desirable.
In addition, combining labeled and path-based solutions manually can't
really be sanely done.
</p>


<p>
When Howells posted his solution, he explicitly disallowed combining the
two labeled LSMs because of implementation difficulties (mainly with
respect to the LSM-specific <tt>secid</tt> which is used by SELinux and
Smack, but none of the others). There was also a
belief that mixing SELinux and Smack (or AppArmor and TOMOYO for that
matter) is not a particularly sought-after feature.  But Schaufler thought
that was 
an unnecessary restriction, one that he was trying to address in his
solution. 
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, Schaufler ended up at the same place.  His proposal also
defers stacking (or "composing") SELinux and Smack, noting that it
"<q>has proven quite a 
challenge</q>". But he was able to get the other combinations
working&mdash;at least to the extent that the kernel would boot without
complaints in the logs.  The Smack tests passed as well. Performance for
Smack with AppArmor, TOMOYO, and  
Yama enabled is "<q>within the noise</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler's version ensures that the hooks for <i>each</i> enabled LSM are
called, which is different than Howells's approach that short-circuited
the other hooks if one denied the access.  Instead, Schaufler patches call
each LSM's hooks, remembering the last non-zero return (denial or error of
some sort) as the return value for the hook.  His argument is that an LSM
could reasonably expect to see&mdash;and possibly record information
about&mdash;each access decision, even if it has been denied by another LSM.
</p>

<p>
Much of the "guts" of the changes are described in the <a
href="/Articles/518450/">infrastructure 
patch</a>, which is the largest of the five patches.  The others make
fairly modest (if pervasive) changes to SELinux, Smack, TOMOYO, and
AppArmor to support stacking.  As it turns out, Yama "<q>required no
change and gets in free</q>".  The changes to the individual LSMs are
optional, as they can still be used (in a non-stackable way) without them. 
</p>

<p>
Stacking is governed by the <tt>CONFIG_SECURITY_COMPOSER</tt> option.  If
that is not chosen, all of the existing LSMs function as they do today.
If stacking is built in, the <tt>security=</tt> boot parameter can then be
used to control which 
LSMs are enabled.  For example, <tt>security=selinux,apparmor</tt> will
 enable those two.  If nothing is specified on the boot command line,
all of the LSMs built into the kernel will be enabled.  The
<tt>/proc/PID/attr/current</tt> interface has also been changed to report
information from any of the active LSMs (only SELinux, Smack, and AppArmor
actually use that interface today).
</p>

<p>
Existing kernels store pointers to the hooks implemented by an LSM in a
<tt>struct&nbsp;security_operations</tt> called
<tt>security_ops</tt>.  Schaufler's patch replaces that with an array of
<tt>security_operations</tt> pointers called <tt>composer_ops</tt>.  That
array is indexed based on 
the <tt>order</tt> that is assigned to each LSM as it is registered.  The
first entry (<tt>composer_ops[0]</tt>) is reserved for the Linux capabilities
hooks.  Those have been manually "stacked" into the LSMs for some time, so
entries in <tt>composer_ops[0]</tt> get zeroed out if one of the other LSMs
implements the hook (as the capabilities checks will be done there).  If
there is no entry in <tt>composer_ops[0]</tt>, each of the hooks in the
other entries in that array are called, as described above.
</p>

<p>
The security "blobs" (private storage for each LSM) are still managed by
the LSMs, but because there are blob pointers sprinkled around various
kernel data structures (e.g. inodes, files, sockets, keys, etc.), a
"composer blob" is used.  That blob contains pointers to each of the active
LSM blobs, and new calls are used to get and set the blob pointers
(e.g. <tt>lsm_get_inode()</tt> or <tt>lsm_set_sock()</tt>).  Most of the
changes for the individual LSMs are converting to use this new interface.
</p>

<p>
So far, most of the comments have been about implementation details;
Schaufler addressed those in the second version of the patch set.  Notably
missing, at least so far, were some of the concerns about strange
interactions between stacked LSMs leading to vulnerabilities that have come
up in earlier discussions. But, without
any major complaints, one would guess some more testing will be done,
including gathering some additional performance numbers, before the
linux-kernel gauntlet will be run.  The rest of the kernel developers have
heard about the need for stacking LSMs enough times that it seems likely
that Schaufler's patches (or something derived from them) will eventually
pass muster.

I would assume that calling each module's hook unconditionally would prevent any (new) security problem with stacking, as you can no longer get into a state which you couldn't reach anyway with only one module loaded.<br>

i don't see why there could be a confusion since denying access is the same as failing the operation later for some other reason, say ENOMEM. in either case the LSM allowing the access cannot assume that the operation will actuallly succeed.<br>

<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 2013 LSFMM Summit, Martin Petersen led a discussion of the proposed
"hints"&mdash;indications of how the storage is being used&mdash;for the
T10 SCSI 
block command (SBC) standard.  These hints "keep coming up" when he talks
to storage and flash vendors, but the vote on them in the T10 committee was
postponed until a later ballot.  Petersen said he was looking for feedback
from filesystem developers on which of the hints&mdash;describing access
patterns, caching, data placement, and other attributes&mdash;would be
useful.  He is trying 
to identify which hints could be usefully passed into the block I/O stack via
<tt>struct bio</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
Petersen put up a list of the hints implemented or used by Linux, NFS, and
Windows, along with those proposed for T10 SBC.
Some of the hints themselves were questioned, including
"SEQUENTIAL_BACKWARDS" for NFS, which Ric Wheeler wondered about:
are there really applications that need to do that?  It turns out that some
unnamed database does actually have that access pattern. 
</p>

<p>
But beyond that, there are questions of interpreting the hints.  As Ted
Ts'o asked: how sequential is "sequential" and how frequent is "frequent".
He also asked about the "READ/WRITE RANDOMNESS" hints proposed for T10.
That, at least, has an answer: it is a two-byte value that indicates how
likely a given logical block address (LBA) will be read or written randomly
within an LBA range, Petersen said.
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner said that the question comes down to what user space will find
useful because filesystems just get hints from <tt>fadvise()</tt>. The
hints that user space provides via <tt>fadvise()</tt> are what the
filesystem can pass down to the storage.  Petersen wanted to know if 
there are
hints that could be added, and Wheeler noted that filesystems are really an
application to the storage subsystems.  But Boaz Harrosh thought that kind
of thinking was a "pyramid standing on its head"; the "smarts" reside at
the upper layers, never at the lower, he said, so the hints should just be
ignored as a "layering violation".
</p>

<p>
Ts'o noted that the hints tend to tie filesystem developers in knots
because the meaning is undefined at the storage layer, which makes it hard
to give it any meaning above that.  The T10 stack is so abstract that
filesystems and application developers have no idea what the storage will
do with the hints, he said.
</p>

<p>
But the hints are also fairly specific to "spinning rust", Roland Dreier said,
so adding more hints won't really help.  Petersen countered that tagging
data consistently will allow the storage vendors to eventually figure
things out.  For example, he said, giving hints on metadata and nothing
else might lead to better performance.
</p>

<p>
But hinting will just lead to application problems, Harrosh said.  Each
vendor will treat the hints differently, based on a single application that
is important to them. That will lead to a feedback loop so that
applications are tuned for specific storage vendors.  Dreier said that with
his "array vendor hat on", he would ignore the hints entirely.  That's
fine, Petersen said, as other devices will at least have the opportunity to
act on the hints.
</p>

<p>
One use case that Petersen described involved a "well-known database from a
well-known company" that does a lot of random I/O.  It would like to be
able to back up the data sequentially, but without having that data get
cached, so that it wouldn't impact performance of the normal database
processing.  Another is for Btrfs, which can do deduplication and
compression, so it would make sense for it to tell that to the storage and
avoid wasted effort at that level.

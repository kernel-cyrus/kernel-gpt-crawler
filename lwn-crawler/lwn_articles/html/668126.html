           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 16, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel's out-of-memory (OOM) behavior has been a topic of discussion
almost since the inception of the linux-kernel mailing list.  Opinions
abound on how the kernel should account for memory, whether it should allow
memory to be overcommitted, what it means to be out of memory, and what
should be done when that situation comes about.  There seems to be general
agreement on only one thing: OOM situations are bad, and the kernel's
handling of OOM situations is even worse.  Over the years, numerous
developers have tried to improve the situation; the latest attempt can be
seen in two patch sets from Michal Hocko.
<p>
<h4>OOM detection</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/667939/">first patch set</a> tries to answer a
question that one might think would be obvious: how do we know when the
system is out of memory?  The problem is that a running system is highly
dynamic.  The lack of a free page to allocate at the moment does
not mean that such pages could not be created; given the high cost of
invoking the OOM killer, it is best not to declare an OOM situation if the
kernel might be able to scrounge some memory from somewhere.  Current
kernels, though, are a bit unpredictable regarding when they give up and,
in some cases, might wait too long.
<p>
If there are no pages to satisfy an allocation request, the kernel will
perform direct reclaim to try to free some memory.  In some cases, direct
reclaim will be successful; that happens, for example, if it
finds clean pages that can be immediately repurposed.  In other cases,
though, reclaiming pages requires writing them back to backing store; those
pages will not be available for what is, from a computer's perspective, a
long time.  Still, they should become available eventually, so the kernel
is justifiably reluctant to declare an OOM situation for as long as
reclaimable pages exist.
<p>
The problem is that there are no real bounds on how long it might take for
"reclaimable" pages to actually be reclaimed, for a number of reasons.
Additionally, the allocator can conceivably find itself endlessly retrying
if a single 
page is reclaimed, even if that page cannot be used for the current
allocation request.  As a result, the kernel can find itself hung up in
allocation attempts that do not succeed, but which do not push the system
into OOM handling.
<p>
Michal's patch defines a new heuristic for deciding when the system is
truly out of memory.  When an allocation attempt initially fails, the logic
is similar to what is done in current kernels: a retry will be attempted
(after an I/O wait) if there is a memory zone in the system where the sum
of free and reclaimable pages is at least as large as the allocation
request.  If the retries continue to fail, though, a couple of changes come
into play.
<p>
The first of those is that there is an upper bound of sixteen retries;
after that, the kernel gives up and goes into OOM-handling mode.  That may
bring about an OOM situation sooner than current kernels (which can loop
indefinitely) will, but, as Michal <a href="/Articles/668133/">put it</a>:
"<q>OOM killer would be more appropriate than looping without any
progress for unbounded amount of time</q>".  Beyond that, the kernel's
count of the number of reclaimable pages is discounted more heavily after
each unsuccessful retry; after eight retries, that number will be cut in
half.  That makes it increasingly unlikely that the estimate of reclaimable
pages will motivate the kernel to keep retrying.
<p>
The result of these changes is that the kernel will go into OOM handling in
a more predictable manner when memory gets tight.  Users will still curse
the results, but the system as a whole should more reliably survive OOM
situations.
<p>
<a name="reaper"></a>
<h4>The OOM reaper</h4>
<p>
At least, that should be the case if the OOM killer is actually able to
free pages 
when the kernel invokes it.  As <a href="/Articles/627419/">has been
seen</a> in recent years, it is not that hard to create a situation where
the OOM killer is unable to make any progress, usually because the
targeted process is blocked on a lock and the OOM situation itself prevents
that lock from being released.  If an OOM-killed process cannot run, it
cannot exit and, thus, it cannot free 
its memory; as a result, the entire OOM-killing mechanism fails.
<p>
The observation (credited to Mel Gorman and Oleg Nesterov) at the core of
Michal's <a href="/Articles/666024/">OOM reaper patch set</a> is that it
is not necessary to wait for the targeted process to die before stripping
it of much of its memory.  That process has received a SIGKILL signal,
meaning it will not run again in user mode.  That, in turn, means that it
will no longer access any of its anonymous pages.   Those pages can be
reclaimed immediately without changing the end result.
<p>
The OOM reaper is implemented as a separate thread; this is done because
the reaper must be able to run when it is called upon to do its work.
Other kernel execution mechanisms, such as workqueues, might themselves be
blocked by the OOM situation, so they cannot be counted upon.  If this
patch is merged, the <tt>oom_reaper</tt> thread will sit unused on the
majority of Linux systems out there, but it will be certain to be available
on the systems where it is needed.
<p>
The reaper is not without its rough edges.  It must still take the
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> lock to free the pages, meaning that it could be blocked
if <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is held elsewhere.  Still, Michal says that the
probability of trouble "<q>is reduced considerably</q>" compared to
current kernels.  One other potential problem is that, if the targeted
process is dumping core at the time it is killed, removing its pages may
corrupt the dump.  This tradeoff is worthwhile, though, Michal says, since
keeping the system running is more important in such situations.
<p>
Memory-management patches are notoriously difficult to get merged into the
kernel.  With regard to the OOM detection patch, Michal said the work "<q>has
been sitting and waiting for the fundamental objections for quite some time
and there were none</q>".  He would like to see it merged in 4.6 or
thereafter.  Objections to the OOM reaper have also been hard to find, but
there has been no talk yet as to when that patch might head for the
mainline.  Once these patches get there, the OOM-handling subsystem may
work a little better, but it seems unlikely that users will appreciate it
any more than they do now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Of course you don't really appreciate a crashing program, but I very much prefer that over a freezing up of the whole system. So I do appreciate a system responing to my input very much!<br>

I agree! The out-of-memory killer is infinitely better than having my system freezing up due to swap-thrashing. I've never once thought "oh, I wish my system had hung indefinitely there instead of killing Firefox".<br>

I can't help but chime in with a "me too", I'd much prefer processes be killed quickly when free-able memory is close to running out. If it's anywhere near close, say less than 5% of memory available for use as fs cache, something is already wrong.<br>
<p>
The last few times I ran into what should have been an OOM situation, everything just froze, for longer than I cared to wait (at least a few minutes). I've seen this for the whole system, and also for a couple processes in a memory cgroup. I've seen it with no swap at all, and also with some swap space. Freezing for ~15 seconds is worse than death IMHO.<br>
<p>
I "devops" some servers that run some processes that occasionally act up, and I've resorted to writing a script that checks memory conditions every few seconds and if there isn't a nice large buffer of free+cache memory, goes about sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL to the biggest members of the suspected set of processes (and notifying me).<br>

Do I understand correctly that all problems with OOM handling in Linux are caused by memory overcommitting? Is it true that memory overcommitting is required for two reasons: (1) because fork is used to create child processes and (2) because shared objects are mapped as MAP_PRIVATE?<br>
<p>
Can't the (1) be fixed by using something like posix_spawn and can't the (2) be fixed by mapping as MAP_PRIVATE only GOT and PLT and MAP_SHARED everything else in shared objects? As I understand in this case it will be possible to default to vm.overcommit_memory=2 and forget about oom-killer.<br>

Well, the first issue is that while those two points are part of why, they're far from the whole story.<br>
<p>
In particular, there are most certainly programs which allocate large amounts of address space without necessarily using that memory in the end.<br>
<p>
In addition, changing every use of fork to posix_spawn is... a decidedly nontrivial undertaking.<br>
<p>
Besides that, failing to check the return value of malloc() is a pervasive issue, which has been worsened by the default-overcommit behavior on Linux has trained people that "malloc() never fails."<br>
<p>
And then, if the user program DOES check the return value of malloc(), what are its options?<br>
 - Drop some internal caches<br>
 - Loop forever<br>
 - Die<br>
<p>
i.e., the exact same issue as the OOM killer, with the added downside of not having the ability to take advantage of global information - say, page cache pages being clean.<br>
<p>
And while it may _seem_ as though there's a benefit there, where the allocating process takes the hit, it's a false fairness - after all, a 3.9 GB allocation may have just succeeded for another program, and now your shell wants one measly page and can't get it.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; there are most certainly programs which allocate large amounts of address space without necessarily using that memory in the end.</font><br>
<p>
For example programs that create threads.  While the stack in main thread grows dynamically, rest of the threads have a fixed sized stack.  While one can specify what sized stack threads get, most programs don't.  <br>
<p>
By default, thread stack sizes on Linux are currently 8MB.  If you have a lot of programs that use a lot of threads, without overcommit that would eat quite a bit of RAM.<br>

I would be so happy to see this merged. I wish it were merged today and backported to all previous kernels.<br>
<p>
It's so annoying when OOM happens, it's infinitely more annoying when the kernel decides to freeze the whole system up for minutes, until it says "oh, sorry, I was supposed to kill this guy". I wished many times it would just go ahead with the kill immediately.<br>
<p>
By 4.6, I might have already ended up with a new motherboard and more ram, so this fix would be too late.<br>

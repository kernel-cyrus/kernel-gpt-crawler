           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 27, 2018</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers go to some lengths to mark read-only data so that it can
be protected by the system's memory-management unit.
Memory that cannot be changed cannot be altered by an attacker to corrupt the
system.  But the kernel's mechanisms for managing read-only memory do not
work for memory that must be initialized after the initial system bootstrap
has completed.  A <a href="/Articles/750229/">patch set from Igor Stoppa</a>
seeks to change that situation by creating a new API just for
late-initialized read-only data.
<p>
The most straightforward way to create read-only data is, of course, the
C&nbsp;<tt>const</tt> keyword.  The compiler will annotate any data marked
with <tt>const</tt>, and the linker will ensure that it is placed in memory
that ends up being marked read-only.  But <tt>const</tt> only works at
build time.  The <a href="/Articles/666550/">post-init read-only data
mechanism</a>, adapted from the grsecurity patch set, takes things a step
further by marking data that can be made read-only once the system's
initialization process has completed.  Data structures that must be set up
during boot, but which need not be modified thereafter, can be protected in
this way.
<p>
Once initialization is completed, though, the (easy) ability to create
read-only data in the kernel goes away.  At that point, any additional
memory needed must be allocated dynamically, and such memory is, by its
nature, dynamic.  So, while a kernel subsystem may well allocate memory,
fill it in, and never change it again, there is no mechanism in place to
actually block further modifications to that memory.
<p>
The proposed new API could be such a mechanism; it is called the
"protectable memory allocator", or 
"pmalloc".   The core concept is that a subsystem allocates a "pool" for a
set of objects that will all be rendered read-only at the same time.  The
individual objects can be allocated from the pool and initialized; then the
whole thing is set in stone.  Or, in terms of code, one starts with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/pmalloc.h&gt;

    struct pmalloc_pool *pool = pmalloc_create_pool();
</pre>
<p>

The return value (on success) is a pointer to a pool from which objects can
be allocated.  Thereafter, objects can be allocated from the pool with any
of:
<p>
<pre>
    void *pmalloc(struct pmalloc_pool *pool, size_t size);
    void *pzalloc(struct pmalloc_pool *pool, size_t size);
    void *pmalloc_array(struct pmalloc_pool *pool, size_t n, size_t size);
    void *pcalloc(struct pmalloc_pool *pool, size_t n, size_t size);
    char *pstrdup(struct pmalloc_pool *pool, const char *s);
</pre>
<p>
The basic allocation function is <tt>pmalloc()</tt>, which allocates a
chunk of memory of the given <tt>size</tt> from the <tt>pool</tt>.
Variants include <tt>pzalloc()</tt> (which zeroes the memory before
returning it), <tt>pmalloc_array()</tt> (to allocate an array of objects),
<tt>pcalloc()</tt> (which perhaps should be called
<tt>pzalloc_array()</tt>), and <tt>pstrdup()</tt> (which allocates memory
and copies a string into it).
<p>
When the process of allocating and initializing objects has run its course,
the entire set of objects associated with the pool is made read-only with a
call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void pmalloc_protect_pool(struct pmalloc_pool *pool);
</pre>
<p>
It's worth noting that it is still possible to allocate objects from the
pool after a call to <tt>pmalloc_protect_pool()</tt>.  The newly allocated
objects will be writable until the next call.  Frequent calls to
<tt>pmalloc_protect_pool()</tt> when many objects are being allocated may
result in faster protection, but it may also waste any unallocated memory
within the pages that are write-protected.
There is no way to "unprotect" memory once it has been made read-only; the
protection of memory in pmalloc is meant to be a permanent thing.
<p>
While there are numerous variants of <tt>pmalloc()</tt> to obtain
protectable memory, there is no <tt>pfree()</tt> function.  The only way to
release this memory is to get rid of the entire pool with:
<p>
<pre>
    void pmalloc_destroy_pool(struct pmalloc_pool *pool);
</pre>
<p>
This call will return all objects allocated from <tt>pool</tt>, so the
caller should be sure that none of them are still in use.
<p>

Underneath this interface, pmalloc uses <tt>vmalloc()</tt> to obtain a
range (some number of pages) of memory; that range is then managed to
satisfy individual allocation requests.  As a result, the pmalloc functions
cannot be used in atomic context, but it is hard to imagine a situation
where that would be necessary in any case.  Marking the pool read-only is a
matter of dipping into the internals of the memory-management layer to
tweak the page-table entries for the pages holding the pool.

<p>
The advantage of using pmalloc is that it can protect objects from unwanted
modifications after they have been initialized.  There is one significant
limitation, though.  While the protection is applied to the page-table
entries in 
the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> area containing the pool, the underlying memory remains
writable in the main system memory map.  So an attacker who can determine
where an object sits in physical memory may be able to bypass the
protection applied by pmalloc entirely.  Pmalloc thus places another
obstacle in an attacker's path, but is not an absolute protection against
modification.
<p>
One thing that is missing from the current patch set is a set of in-kernel
users of the new API.  So it is not entirely clear where Stoppa intends
this mechanism to be used.  That omission will probably have to be
rectified at some point; the kernel community is reluctant to merge new
APIs without in-tree users to show how those APIs work in real-world use.
Once that has been filled in, the community should have some time to debate
the merits of this interface before the 4.18 development cycle begins.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Which is precisely what the patchset does, leaving aside some technical details.<br>
The main points to justify the patchset are:<br>
* better utilization of the pages allocated (and less tlb trashing), compared to plain vmalloc, which allocates at least one new page for each invocation<br>
* segregation of read-only variables, compared to kmalloc<br>
* potentially more efficient code (depends on the specific case), compared to flex_array, certainly easier to read<br>
* grouping of related variables in pools, for ease of protection/destruction<br>
* additional tagging, for usercopy<br>

If an attacker can write to kernel data memory, in practice there is no way to prevent the system takeover. Protecting the pysmap page would help, and it can be done on x86. However the attacker can always revoke that protection from the page table. Same goes for any other page attribute, as long as there is no way to make it permanent (write once).<br>

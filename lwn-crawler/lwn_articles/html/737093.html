There is a lot of information buried in the kernel's Git repositories that,
if one looks closely enough, can yield insights into how the development
community works in the real world.  It can show how the
idealized hierarchical model of the kernel development community matches
what actually happens and provide a picture of how the community's web of
trust is used to verify contributions.  Read on for an analysis of the
merge operations that went into the 4.14 development cycle.

<p>
The diagram to the right was generated from the commits merged for the 4.14
release, through 4.14-rc5.  It is unfortunately dense; click on the image
to get a version that has a chance of being legible.  In short, it shows

<a href="/Articles/737094/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/patchflow-4.14.svg"
alt="[Patchflow diagram]" width=300px align="right" vspace=3></a>

all of the subsystem trees that were pulled into the mainline and the
number of patches that flowed out of each.
<p>
LWN has posted these diagrams a couple of times in the past, for the
<a href="/Articles/318699/">2.6.29</a> and <a
href="/Articles/670209/">4.4</a> development cycles.  They have always
shown a structure 
that is far flatter than the hierarchical maintainer model would suggest.
In the real world, mid-level maintainers are relatively rare; most
maintainers send pull requests directly to Linus Torvalds.  Doing so helps
to get changes into the mainline more quickly; that is why, for example,
some security-module maintainers recently <a
href="/Articles/737254/">decided</a> to bypass the security 
maintainer and push their trees directly to Torvalds.
<p>
That said, the hierarchy shows more clearly than it has in past years.  A
number of subsystems are growing to the point where there needs to be some
overall higher-level coordination.  So there are more two and three-level
trees than there used to be.  As the kernel community continues to grow, it
will almost certainly need to add more mid-level maintainers.
<p>
<h4>Signing of pull requests</h4>
<p>
Diagrams like this one can be interesting to look at just to see how work
is flowing through the system. But they can also be used to reveal
semi-hidden aspects of how that work is being done.  This time around, your
editor has decided to put a focus on the security of the process.
<p>

Shortly after the 3.0 kernel was released, it was revealed that kernel.org,
where many kernel developers (including Torvalds) keep their
repositories, had been broken into.  This episode brought the merging of
patches to a halt for some time and delayed the 3.1 release by some months;
it also created a great deal of concern over the possibility that
somebody's repository might have been corrupted in an attempt to get
malicious code into the mainline kernel.  No evidence of that
happening ever turned up, but the realization that it maybe could have
happened drove a number of changes in the development community.
<p>
One of those changes was the establishment of a web of trust among kernel
developers; at the <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2011/">2011 Kernel
Summit</a> in Prague, an initial 
key-signing ritual was held to bootstrap that web.  The ability to GPG-sign
commits and tags was added to Git.  One need merely tag the commit at the
head of a series to be pulled with a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    git tag -s fixes-for-linus
</pre>
<p>
and request that the <tt>fixes-for-linus</tt> tag be pulled.  If the
receiving maintainer pulls with the <tt>--verify-signatures</tt> option,
Git will ensure that a valid signature exists before doing the merge.
<p>
The idea was that developers would sign
their repositories before sending pull requests, allowing upstream
maintainers to 
verify that those pull requests corresponded to legitimate streams of
development.  Even if an attacker could put up a convincing copy of a
developer's repository (or somehow add a malicious commit to a real
repository) and send a fake pull request, the attack would not
succeed because the attacker would not be able to attach a proper signature
to the relevant tag.
<p>
This system has been in place for six years now, and many developers
routinely sign tags for outgoing commits and verify signatures when pulling from
others.  But do they all do so?  It is possible to find out.

When a signed commit or tag is pulled into
a repository, the signature is stashed into the merge commit, allowing the
provenance of the changes to be verified at a later date.  That also makes
it possible to examine the merges in the kernel repository and see how many
of them carry signature information.
<p>
Referring back to the tree plot on the right, one will see that some
repositories are shown in black boxes, while others use red boxes.  The
repositories in red are those from which no signed merges happened during
the period in question.  The results show that, while many developers do
sign their tags before sending changes upstream, quite a few do not.
<p>
More to the point, the repository that sends more traffic into the mainline
than any other — networking — makes almost no use of signatures anywhere in
the chain.  The "tip" tree (containing x86 and core-kernel work) is another
significant tree that does not employ signatures, as is the linux-block
tree.  Neither the security tree nor the crypto tree employ cryptographic
signatures.
Pull requests from the graphics tree into the mainline are signed,
but many of the trees feeding into graphics do not use signatures.  On the
other hand, some high-volume trees, such as arm-soc, have almost complete
signature coverage from the leaves up to the mainline.
<p>
Years of traffic on the kernel mailing lists suggests that maintainers
rarely ask for signatures to be added to pull requests that lack them.
Torvalds will typically demand it when the tree being pulled is hosted on a
public service like GitHub, but is otherwise happy to pull from unsigned
tags.  He does verify signatures when they do exist, though.
Few other maintainers require (or even mention) signatures at all.
<p>
Your editor asked around a bit to get a sense for why some maintainers are
not using signed tags.  The answer was typically along the lines of "I
never got around to incorporating them into my workflow".  One maintainer
admitted that he had probably forgotten the passphrase for his GPG key by
now and 
would have to create a new one to be able to start signing tags.  The
problem, if there is one, is not any real hostility to the idea of
signed commits.  It is just that, since signatures are not required,
many busy
subsystem maintainers have not made the effort to start using them.
<p>
The result is that the kernel has a web of trust that, one might fairly
conclude, is not really protecting much.  It's nice to have the verification
on pull requests that do carry signatures but, since those signatures seem
to be almost entirely optional at present, they offer little protection
against a malicious pull request.
<p>
If the intent of signed tags is limited to enabling developers to host
repositories on untrusted services, then perhaps signature checking as it
is practiced now is sufficient.  Perhaps the threat model need not include
more sophisticated attackers trying to sneak vulnerabilities into the
kernel via some developer's tree on a well-run site.  After all,
kernel.org itself seems relatively well protected these days, and kernel
developers have 
demonstrated that, like developers of most other projects, they are entirely
capable of introducing security bugs at a sufficient rate without external
assistance. 
<p>
But if the intent is to make the kernel development process resilient
against attacks on developers' machines or kernel.org, then there is some
work yet to be done.  It is worth remembering that the web of trust came
about as a response to a compromise of kernel.org, after all.  If we want
to prepare for a recurrence of that sort of incident, the actual threat
model needs to be defined, and the use of protective techniques like signed
tags should probably not be optional. Partially implemented security
mechanisms have a distressing tendency to fail when put to the test.

Could git grow some secondary checking for cherry-picked commits?  Like, the commit would say 'cherry-picked from abcde' and then you could optionally run something which makes sure the diff being applied in this commit is the same as that from abcde.

Agreed!  Another reason is to pick out a particular change without all the ones that went before it.  So, given a particular commit and the other one it was cherry-picked from, it should be possible to check that the diff is the same, while ignoring the commit message, whitespace changes in the file content and other things which cause the SHA to be different but aren't important for this comparison.<br>

There's the -x flag to cherry-pick to do that. Note that conflicts will trip this up.<br>

Making all commit from everyone as mandatory to be signed..otherwise refused to be pulled in or merged in the mainline.Sounds harsh, but that is what it should be.I believe may wise heads are there already thinking in that line and am surprised not yet imposed or implemented. Love to know the constraints.<br>

Signing in git really isn't as hard or scary as people think it is. Make a key if necessary, configure gpg-agent so it caches key passwords for at least a few seconds (or else rebases will be painful), and set commit.gpgSign.<br>
<p>
The only recurring effort is re-entering passwords, but there's nothing to stop you setting gpg-agent's cache time really high if it gets annoying.<br>

In general use of gpg-agent, I wish the cache time could be dynamic.  So, say it starts with a default of 10m.  I use it immediately for a key and then again at 8m into that lifetime.  Here it would be nice to get an automatic extension of another 8m and so on until it does finally timeout due to no use.  I think that would be much more convenient and likely more secure simply because might mean fewer people use reall high timeout values.  Better convenience might also translate to higher adoption rates.<br>

      <p>It kind of is, if you want to do it properly. I have some scripts (available at <a href="https://github.com/saab-simc-admin/workflow-tools">https://github.com/saab-simc-admin/workflow-tools</a>) for maintaining an all-signed workflow, and the amount of corner cases and badly designed interfaces I have to handle is staggering.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that since nobody uses signatures, the code isn't tested - libgit2 (which is, among other things, the base for Ruby's Git support) <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues/4118">used to corrupt the plaintext of signed commits due to a use-after-free bug</a>.</p>

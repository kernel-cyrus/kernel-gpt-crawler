<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>

<p>
A new development in the NVMe world was the subject of a combined storage
and filesystem session led by Stephen Bates at the <a 
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>.  Computational storage namespaces
will allow NVMe devices to offer various types of computation—anything from
simple compression through complex queries and data manipulations—to be
performed 
on the data stored on the device.
</p>

<p>
Bates began the session by noting that he had seen a video of a talk
recently where a professor had calculated that about two-thirds of the
energy used in "high-scale distributed systems" is spent on data movement.
So, large Hadoop clusters or AI-training frameworks are using an enormous
amount of energy just to move data around, without actually doing any real
work ("not actually changing any bits"). That is done because we generally
move our data from storage into memory in order to operate on it, which is
sort of inherent in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann
architecture</a>.  The storage systems are typically somewhat removed from
the processor and, even if they are attached via, say, the PCIe bus, they still
take a lot of power.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind computational storage, he said, is to see if parts of the
computation can be pushed out to the storage layer.  NVMe is more than just
a good storage protocol, it is "an awesome protocol for telling something
to do something".  That request can be sent via a variety of mechanisms
(e.g. direct attached, over fabric) and it can all be done efficiently
because of the NVMe design.
A command is sent as a 64-byte submission queue entry (SQE), which will
result in a 16-byte completion queue entry (CQE) at some later point that
gives the completion status of the command.  NVMe is "super parallel" with
large numbers of queues that can be split up among the cores in an SMP
system.  The queues can be "incredibly deep" and do not need to be
processed in order.  In addition, those 64-byte SQEs do not have to
request a storage operation; "tell me the temperature in Idaho" could be a
valid NVMe command, he said.
</p>

<p>
An NVMe controller may not just be for a single SSD, but could be some
rack-sized storage system with lots of processing power available to it.
Two new namespace types are being defined; one is called "subsystem local
memory", which is byte-addressable in order to facilitate the
computational processing on the local device.  It can be populated from a
traditional, logical 
block address (LBA) namespace or from an object-storage namespace; the
subsystem local memory
becomes the physical address space for the computation.
</p>

<p>
The second new namespace is for computational programs, which can perform
certain actions on the data in the local memory.  Those actions
could be vendor-specific, simple things like compression, executing eBPF
programs, and more.  In theory, you could provide a Docker image to the
NVMe device 
and it could run on the local data, he said.  In some measurements that he
and his 
colleagues have done, they have seen order-of-magnitude reductions in
energy usage by pushing computations out to the storage devices.
</p>

<p>
The challenge is in figuring out how to break up the application's
computation to take 
advantage of this.  There are various efforts from Samsung and within the
<a href="https://www.snia.org/">Storage Networking Industry Association</a>
(SNIA) to define a user-space API for computational storage.  There are
plans for a library that would let applications discover devices and their
computational capabilities; it would provide frameworks for pushing
programs in various languages out to the devices.  There would also be
interfaces for executing the programs and gathering the results.
</p>

<p>
Bates said that it is unlikely that support for this goes directly into the
kernel.  He noted that storage-track organizer Javier González and Samsung
have been 
working on adding infrastructure to io_uring to allow passing arbitrary
NVMe commands from user space, though there are some security concerns that
need to be worked out.  That way the kernel would not need to learn about
these new commands; it would simply send the 64-byte messages and return
the 16-byte replies.  That ability will be useful even beyond the
computational-storage realm as it will allow experimenting with new NVMe
commands. As new commands get proven, they could then move into the kernel
proper. 
</p>

<p>
When Bates started looking at this problem, he was focused on SSDs with
computational storage, but these days he thinks that storage arrays with
computational-storage facilities are the more compelling target.  He also
sees the object-storage namespace as being important for doing
computations; the mapping from files to LBAs in filesystems is complicated,
so avoiding that completely makes sense.  If a filesystem is being used,
the library for computational 
storage would need to be able to turn a file name into a list of LBAs to
operate on.  González said that some of the work on <a
href="/Articles/903855/">ublk</a> may help with parts of that.
</p>

<p>
For storage arrays, the cores controlling the arrays may only be fully
utilized when the array 
is writing at its maximum rate, Bates said.  At other times, there may be
excess capacity and power availability in an array for doing other kinds of
work. Some of his customers have workloads that are highly time-dependent,
so there are largely idle periods where computation could be done on the
storage array, which is much more efficient than moving the data to host
systems for performing the computation.

This is a bit different from the DPUs. DPUs are basically NICs with a complete host OS on them. It's fun watching people get confused when giving them the instructions on how to install Ubuntu on their network card. So you could drive NVMe command queues from the bluefield, but the computational storage is more about pushing compute onto the disk drive itself. One shouldn't have high hopes for how much compute ends up on the disks, but it runs at the speed of the filesystem, so what ever compute you can fit on the disk you should.<br>

Indeed.<br>
<p>
Even ZFS added channel programs, although I don't think they are necessarily very similar or analogues to the IBM ones.<br>
<p>
Given that some SD cards run (obviously unpatched) Linux these days, we keep coming up with novel ways to add "MS-DOS virus" compartments in new devices, some of which are entrusted with very sensitive data, 100% unbeknownst to the owner.<br>
<p>
Useful things to have, but risky at a level few people really can comprehend.  The cool gizmo market segment don't really get why we security-conscious folks like whiskey so much.<br>

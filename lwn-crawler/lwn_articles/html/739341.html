<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 17, 2017</br>
           </div>
When he <a href="/Articles/738812/">released</a> 4.14, Linus Torvalds
warned that the 4.15 merge window might be shorter than usual due to the US
Thanksgiving holiday.  Subsystem maintainers would appear to have heard
him; as of this writing, over 8,800 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline since the opening of the 4.15 merge window.  Read on for
a summary of the most interesting changes found in that first set of
patches.
<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The control-group v2 subsystem finally has a CPU controller, bringing
     <a href="/Articles/729215/">a long story</a> to a happy ending.

<li> The live-patching mechanism has seen a couple of significant
     improvements.  The "shadow variables" mechanism allows the addition of
     data to structures; it will be used in patches that make
     data-structure modifications.  There is also a new callback mechanism
     that can invoke kernel code when an object is patched, extending the
     ability to apply live patches affecting tricky areas like global data
     or assembly code.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The openrisc architecture has gained support for SMP systems.

<li> The RISC-V architecture is now supported â€” <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b293fca43be544483b6488d33ad4b3ed55881064">sort
     of</a>.  "<q>The port is definitely a work in progress. While
     what's there builds and boots with 4.14, it's a bit hard to actually
     see anything happen because there are no device drivers yet</q>".

<li> AMD's secure encrypted
     virtualization feature is now supported.  This feature, which
     builds on the <a href="/Articles/686808/#sme">secure memory
     encryption</a> work merged in 4.14, allows 
     virtual machines to run with memory that is encrypted and unreadable
     by other virtual machines or the host system.

<li> Intel's user-mode instruction prevention (UMIP) feature, which
     disables user-mode access to specific security-relevant instructions,
     is supported.  The feature is disabled by default because it breaks
     some applications (Wine, for example), but the plan is to address
     these problems during this development cycle.

<li> The arm64 architecture has gained support for the <a
     href="https://community.arm.com/processors/b/blog/posts/technology-update-the-scalable-vector-extension-sve-for-the-armv8-a-architecture">scalable
     vector extension</a> mechanism.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Filesystems/block layer</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The Smack security module is now able to work with the overlayfs
     union filesystem.

<li> The XFS filesystem has gained initial support for online filesystem
     checking.  This feature is incomplete and is not yet intended for
     production use.

<li> The NVMe block driver has gained native multipath support, enabling
     high-performance concurrent I/O on high-end systems.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The networking layer now supports the "ThunderboltIP" protocol for
     passing IP packets over a Thunderbolt cable.

<li> Support for <a
     href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-ndata-13">SCTP
     stream schedulers</a> has been added.  Three schedulers (FCFS,
     priority, and round-robin) have been merged.

<li> Most TCP-related sysctl knobs have been made aware of network
     namespaces.

<li> The network queueing discipline subsystem now has a "credit-based
     shaper" module.  Such documentation as exists can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/585d763af09cc21daf48ecc873604ccdb70f6014">this
     commit</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>BPF</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The user-space <tt>bpftool</tt> utility can be used to examine and
     manipulate BPF programs and maps; see <a href="/Articles/739357/">this
     man page</a> for more information.

<li> Hooks have been added to allow security modules to control access to
     BPF objects; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7f9ad2ace17a3521a80831208d431170ef71591f">this
     changelog</a> for more information.

<li> A new BPF-based device controller has been added; it uses the
     version-2 control-group interface.  Documentation for this feature is
     entirely absent, but one can look at the sample program added in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/37f1ba0909dfa12c75f8e8ea7a2f01355ebd60f1">this
     commit</a> that uses it.
</ul>

<li> The new LED activity trigger mechanism can use an attached LED to
     indicate the level of CPU activity in the system.

</ul>
<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There are a couple of new helper scripts for people working on the
     documentation.  <tt>find-unused-docs.sh</tt> will look for kerneldoc
     comments to exported functions that are not actually used in the
     formatted documentation.  <tt>documentation-file-ref-check</tt> can be
     used to find references to nonexistent files in the documentation.

<li> The regmap framework now has support for using hardware spinlocks to
     control access to registers.

<li> The s390 architecture has gained <a
     href="/Articles/164121/">alternatives</a> support, allowing the kernel
     to patch itself at boot time to use newer instructions when they are
     available. 

<li> The lockdep <a href="/Articles/709849/">crossrelease mechanism</a> was
     disabled in 4.14 due to various problems; those have been fixed and
     crossrelease is available once again in 4.15.

<li> The new <tt>down_read_killable()</tt> helper will attempt to take a
     reader/writer semaphore for read access while keeping the process
     killable by user space.

<li> Work toward getting rid of <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> continues; code
     should use <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> or <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> instead.

<li> There is a new timer function:
     <p>
<pre>
    int timer_reduce(struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long expires);
</pre>
     <p>
     It will (1) start the timer if it is not currently running, and
     (2)&nbsp;set the expiration to <tt>expires</tt> if <tt>expires</tt> is
     sooner than the current value.

<li> The <a href="/Articles/260068/">kmemcheck</a> memory-usage debugging
     tool has been removed from the kernel; it has been superseded by tools
     like KASAN.

<li> The <tt>__GFP_COLD</tt> memory-allocation flag, used to request a
     cache-cold page, has been removed.  It wasn't properly implemented
     anyway, and the benefits from using it were far from clear.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>

Additionally, of the 8,861 changesets merged so far, 300 mention
<tt>timer_setup()</tt>, making them part of the ongoing <a
href="/Articles/735887/">timer API change</a>.  There are also
57&nbsp;patches adding <a href="/Articles/739183/">SPDX identifiers</a>.
<p>
By the normal schedule, the 4.15 merge window would end on
November&nbsp;26, with the final 4.15 release happening in mid-January.
But, as mentioned above, the Thanksgiving holiday could change things,
causing the merge window to be either shorter or longer than usual.
However it plays out, LWN will run a followup article covering the rest of
this merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

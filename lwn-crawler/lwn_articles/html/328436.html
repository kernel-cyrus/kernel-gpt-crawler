In a typical development cycle, Linus Torvalds <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/318699/">pulls patches from over 100 git
trees</a> into the mainline repository.  While this is going on, it's not
unusual for him to complain about how some of those trees are managed; most
of the gripes have to do with excessive use of rebasing and merging
operations.  In a recent discussion on the dri-devel list, Linus <a
href="/Articles/328438/">clarified his rules</a> somewhat on subsystem tree
management.  Your editor, on the theory that there might be a developer or
two out there who does not read dri-devel, thought that it might be good to
expose those rules more widely.
<p>

The git "rebase" operation takes a set of patches applied to one tree and
reworks them to apply to a different tree.  If a developer has written some
patches against 2.6.29, he or she can use "git rebase" to turn them into
patches against 2.6.30-rc1 instead.  With git, rebasing can also be used to
make edits to the commit history.  If something needs to be fixed in a
patch which was made some time ago, the developer can (1)&nbsp;remove the
more recent patches from the tree, (2)&nbsp;make the needed changes, and
(3)&nbsp;rebase the removed patches back onto the fixed patch.  This
technique can be used to silently disappear an embarrassing bug from the
history, improve patch changelogs, fix a patch conflict against somebody
else's tree, and more.  It's something that git-based developers simply end up
doing occasionally.
<p>

There are a couple of problems associated with rebasing, though.  One of
those is that it changes the commit history.  Whenever a series of commits
is rebased, anybody who was working with the old history is left out in the
cold.  If a heavily-used tree is rebased, all developers depending on that
tree are forced to scramble to readjust to the new reality.  The other
problem is that rebased patches are changed patches; any testing that they
saw may no longer be applicable.  That is why Linus tends to grumble hard at
trees which have obviously been rebased just prior to the sending of a pull
request.  The changes in those trees probably worked before the rebase, but
the post-rebase changes have not been tested and may not work as well.
<p>
Rebasing is clearly a useful technique, though.  Linus does not tell
developers not to use it; in fact, he encourages it sometimes.  The key rule
that was passed down is this: Thou Shalt Not Rebase Trees With History
Visible To Others.  If a developer has pulled in somebody else's tree, the
resulting tree can no longer be rebased, since that would break the second
developer's history.  Similarly, once a tree has been exported such that
others may be making use of it, it can no longer be rebased.
<p>
On the other hand, private history can be rebased at will - and it probably
should be.  If a patch is seen to introduce a bug, it's best to fix it at
the source rather than reverting it or adding a second, fixup patch; the
result is a cleaner history which is less likely to create problems for
people trying to bisect unrelated bugs.  Your editor has found that
rebasing is often needed to add tags ("Acked-by," for example) to patches
which have been circulated for review.  When one is creating a set of
patches for the mainline kernel, one is really creating an entire history,
not just the end result.  Making that history clean and readable is to
everybody's benefit.
<p>
The associated rule that goes with this, though, is that trees which are
subject to rebasing should not be exposed to the world:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This means: if you're still in the "git rebase" phase, you don't
   	push it out. If it's not ready, you send patches around, or use
   	private git trees (just as a "patch series replacement") that you
   	don't tell the public at large about.
</div>
<p>
So, in other words, trees which might be rebased should be kept private.
They should also not have other developers' trees pulled into them.
<p>
It's worth noting that Linus very much practices what he preaches on this
front.  The mainline git repository accepts 10,000 or so changesets every
development cycle, but it is never rebased.  And that is a good thing:
rebasing the mainline would cause massive pain throughout the development
community.
<p>

Merging is the other place where subsystem maintainers can run afoul of the
Chief Penguin.  A "merge" in git is similar to a merge in most other source
code management systems; it joins two (or more) independent lines of
development into the current branch.  Git merges differ, though, in that
they can have more than two incoming branches; Ingo Molnar is famous for
his use of "octopus merges" joining vast numbers of branches in a single
operation.  In almost all cases, performing a merge adds a special commit
to the repository indicating that the merge has been done and noting which
files, if any, had conflicts.
<p>
Merges go both ways.  When Linus pulls a subsystem tree into the mainline,
the result is a merge.  But it is also common for developers to perform
merges in the other direction; they will pull the mainline (or some
higher-level subsystem tree) into a branch containing a local line of
development.  It is natural to want to develop code against the current
state of the art; it gives confidence that the end result will work with
everybody else's changes and minimizes the chances of an ugly merge conflict
later on.
<p>
But excessive pulling from the mainline (as evidenced by the merge commits
which result) tends to irritate Linus.  As he put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But if I see a lot of "Merge branch 'linus'" in your logs, I'm not
   	going to pull from you, because your tree has obviously had random
   	crap in it that shouldn't be there. You also lose a lot of
   	testability, since now all your tests are going to be about all my
   	random code.
</div>
<p>
As anybody who has worked with tip-of-the-repository kernels knows, the
state of the mainline at any random point can be, well, random.  So
frequent pulling of the mainline into a development branch will add a
certain amount of randomness to that branch; this randomness is not
particularly helpful for somebody who is trying to get a feature working.
It also increases the chances that another developer who ends up in the middle of
the series while running a bisect operation will encounter unrelated bugs.
So Linus would rather that developers not pull down from upstream trees:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And, in fact, preferably you don't pull my tree at ALL, since
   	nothing in my tree should be relevant to the development work _you_
   	do.  Sometimes you have to (in order to solve some particularly
   	nasty dependency issue), but it should be a very rare and special
   	thing, and you should think very hard about it.
</div>
<p>
The reality of the situation tends not to be so strict, though.  An
occasional merge to stay on top of what's happening elsewhere can make
sense.  What Linus suggests, though, is that the merges happen at specific
release points.  So pulling the tip of the mainline tree into a development
tree probably does not make sense, but there might be an argument for
pulling in 2.6.29 or 2.6.30-rc1.  Doing things this way allows development
to be based on a (hopefully) relatively stable point where the issues are
known.
<p>
The temptation to merge in the mainline during development can be hard to
resist; one likes to know whether one's work is even remotely relevant to
the current state of the code.  Fortunately, git makes it really easy to
create throwaway branches and test out merges and integration there.  Once
it's clear that things work, the test branch can be deleted and the
(unmerged) development branch sent upstream.
<p>
Similar rules apply to the merging of downstream code.  The receiving
repository should be in a reasonably well defined and stable state;
typically developers maintain a "for upstream" branch for this kind of
merge.  And the downstream code should be "ready": it should be at some
sort of release point and not in a random state of development.
<p>
Of course, these rules <a href="/Articles/328478/">are not absolute</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Git does allow people to do many different things, and solve
	problems different ways. I just want all the regular workflows to
	be "good practice", but then if you have to occasionally break the
	rules to solve some odd problem, go ahead and break the rules (and
	tell people why you did it that way this time).
</div>
<p>
Linus first started playing with BitKeeper in February, 2002, so the kernel
community now has seven years worth of experience with distributed version
control.  But the truth of the matter is that we are still figuring out the
best way to use this particular tool.  This is a process which is likely to
continue for some time yet.  As other large projects move toward using
tools like git, they may want to look hard at the processes and rules which
have been developed in the kernel community; they might just be able to
shorten their own learning experience.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

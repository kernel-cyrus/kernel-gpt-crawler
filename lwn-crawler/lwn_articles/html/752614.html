<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 27, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit, Ted
Ts'o introduced an integrity feature akin to <a
href="/Articles/459420/">dm-verity</a> that targets Android,
at least to start with.  It is meant to protect the integrity of files on
the system so that any tampering would be detectable.  The
initial use case would be for a certain special type of Android file, but other
systems may find uses for it as well.
</p>

<p>
Android has a system partition that is read-only and protected with
dm-verity.  It must be completely rewritten in order to update
it; after that, a reboot is required to start using the new data.  Updating
a filesystem protected with dm-verity is a heavyweight operation, Ts'o said. 
But Android has some system-level programs that
need to be updated with some frequency,
so there is the idea of privileged
Android packages (APKs) that would not live in the system partition.  These
are somewhat like setuid-root binaries, Ts'o said, but Google wants them
to be updated like any other appâ€”in the background, possibly unnoticed by the
user.
</p>

<p>
Normally, APKs have a signature that is checked once at download time and
then never checked again.  For the privileged APKs, Google wants to do the
signature check on every use of the APK.  That sounds like a job for the
<a href="/Articles/488906/">integrity measurement architecture</a> (IMA),
which targets file-level integrity and is already in the kernel, but
its performance is not really up to the Android use case, Ts'o said.  APKs
can be large, with multiple translations and other pieces that are never
used.  Doing a checksum of the entire package before executing it will slow
down the user experience and use more power; fs-verity will only check the
pieces of the APK as they are actually needed.
</p>

<p>
The way it does that is by creating a file-level <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> that has a
cryptographic hash for each page-sized block of the file.  The root of the
tree will be signed; verifying hashes as the tree is traversed is then
enough to ensure that those parts of the file have not been changed.
</p>

<p>
These APKs will be marked as immutable in the filesystem; they
will need to be replaced whenever they are updated.  The Merkle tree will
be placed directly after the normal file data and the tree will be followed
by a header that will store the size (<tt>i_size</tt>) of the
original APK file.  That will be used as the size of the file when it is
accessed by the rest of the system.
</p>

<p>
Reporting a smaller <tt>i_size</tt> is perhaps the most controversial part
of fs-verity, Ts'o said.  For an immutable file, though, he doesn't think
it will cause problems elsewhere.  He considered using dm-verity with
loopback mounts, but that would require all APK-handling code throughout the system
to be updated, while fs-verity with the <tt>i_size</tt> switch allows the
verification to be transparent to the rest of the system.
</p>

<p>
Bruce Fields asked about performance versus IMA, but Ts'o
has not measured it; he
believes it will be a big win for low-powered ARM devices, though. The key used by
fs-verity would either be baked into the kernel directly or there would be
a key-signing key in the kernel that would be used to verify the key used
to sign the Merkle tree.  It is the same basic model as for signed kernel
modules, he said.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara asked about accessing data beyond <tt>i_size</tt>, noting that
calling <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/mpage.c#L318"><tt>mpage_getpages()</tt></a>
will not work.  Ts'o acknowledged that and said that fs-verity has its own
scheme for reading pages past <tt>i_size</tt> and populating the page
cache.  Right now, there are "some hacks" that will need to be cleaned up
before the code can go upstream.

<p>
Chris Mason wondered if that mechanism
could be generalized to provide file streams (or forks) for Linux.  Ts'o said that
would mean that other filesystems beyond just ext4 would need to implement
it.  Mason argued that this feature is already adding stream support, just
for a single, specialized type.  But Dave Chinner noted that there is
already some precedent for filesystems storing data beyond the reported
<tt>i_size</tt>: XFS directories do so.  Ts'o also pointed out that he is
able to do a bunch of simplification in the code because these files are immutable.
</p>

<p>
The initial implementation of fs-verity is "going to be massively
cheating", Ts'o said; the code will be found in the Android kernel
repositories, but that is not the code that will be proposed for the
mainline.  He has been talking with Mimi Zohar about integrating fs-verity
with IMA and he plans to discuss its design at the Linux Security Summit.

Well, the design seems like a reasonable way to address the performance issue they're seeing, for reasons given in the article.  You have to start somewhere, and I guess this project is still in early stages.<br>

But, you never know.  And there may be some interesting parameters to tune here.  I'll be curious to hear what they find out!  <br>

I would be very interested in ways to get a hash of file contents from userspace, *without* calculating the hash each time.<br>
<p>
Use cases:<br>
- synchronization/backups<br>
- caching of remote data<br>
- content indexing<br>
<p>
The current approaches are:<br>
- rely on the mtime<br>
- rehash<br>
<p>
Ideal would be a solution which stores a merkle tree (even with large blocks, e.g. 1 MByte per hash), using a well known cryptographic hash. The hash should be the same for all filesystems (probably configurable).<br>

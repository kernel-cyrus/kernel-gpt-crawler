For years, kernel developers have been told to avoid allocating large chunks of
physically contiguous memory; as the system runs and memory becomes
fragmented, satisfying such allocations becomes increasingly difficult.
But, as Zi Yan pointed out in a memory-management track session at the 2019
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, there are times
when contiguous memory is useful.  In this session, the memory-management
developers discussed ways to make such allocations more likely to succeed.
<p>
There are a lot of uses for physically contiguous memory, Yan said.  The
use of huge (2MB) or gigantic (1GB) pages improves performance by reducing
the demands on the CPU's translation lookaside buffer (TLB).  But it also
turns out that many high-bandwidth peripheral devices also prefer
physically contiguous memory; those devices, too, have TLBs that can run
out of space.  A device must respond to a TLB miss by walking through its
internal page tables, which tends to be rather slower than when the CPU
does it.
<p>
There are three ways of allocating large physically contiguous chunks now.
One is the <a href="/Articles/374424/">libhugetlbfs</a> virtual filesystem,
but it requires that memory be set aside for that purpose at boot time.
Users may well get the size wrong, and there is no interface to allocate
memory from libhugetlbfs inside the kernel.  The second method, transparent

huge pages, suffers from fragmentation and must occasionally do compaction
of system memory.  It also depends on the kernel's buddy allocator, meaning
that it is limited to buffers of size <tt>MAX_ORDER</tt>, which is normally
set to eleven, meaning a maximum size of 2048 4096-byte pages.  It thus
cannot even come close to providing gigantic pages.  Finally, there is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L8187"><tt>alloc_contig_range()</tt></a>,
which is used with the <a href="/Articles/486301/">CMA memory
allocator</a>.  This functionality is not available to user space, though.
<p>
Dave Hansen pointed out that libhugetlbfs can now be resized at run time,
eliminating one of the concerns there.  Andrea Arcangeli thought it might
be useful to be able to allocate transparent huge pages from libhugetlbfs,
and that it might not be that hard to implement.  It seems that the real
problem isn't necessarily the ability to allocate large
chunks, but concerns about the time required to do so, since compaction may
be required to 
make such a chunk available.  There was some general
discussion on quick allocation of higher-order chunks of memory without any
conclusions.

<p>
Mel Gorman said that allocation latency for large chunks was an old
problem.  The kernel used to run into multi-second stalls when faced with
such requests, but that was "a long, long time ago".  Until somebody has
observed and nailed down problems with current kernels, he sees those
problems as being mostly hypothetical.  Transparent huge pages have been
through a few implementations since the 3.0 kernel; there is a lot of old
information out there on the net that has not caught up with the current
state of affairs.  So anybody who is having trouble with large allocations
should observe their systems, enable tracepoints, and report the results —
all with a current, upstream kernel.  "Don't handwave this one", he said,
and he cautioned that he would not lose sleep over reports about problems
on enterprise kernels.
<p>
Yan was not finished, though: he had a proposal for a new mechanism to
defragment virtual 
memory areas (VMAs) after memory has been allocated.  This would be done by
finding pairs of pages that could be exchanged in a way that would improve
the situation.  Unlike the kernel's <tt>khugepaged</tt> thread, it would
defragment in place rather than allocating huge pages up front and moving
data into them.  The page-exchange idea caused a few raised eyebrows in the
room; it seemed overly complex for the problem at hand.  The advantage of
this approach, Yan said, is that it doesn't require any pages to be
allocated; data is exchanged between pages by copying word-by-word through
the CPU's registers.
<p>
Gorman asked why anybody should bother avoiding allocation of temporary
pages; Yan said it might be worthwhile for larger pages, but the group was
unconvinced.  When Gorman asked about performance measurements, Yan replied
that this exchange was faster than simply migrating two pages, but it was
not clear why.  Hansen asked what the overall problem was that was being
solved, Yan said that it is a way to obtain 1GB gigantic pages without
needing to change the kernel's <tt>MAX_ORDER</tt> parameter.  The group was
not convinced that this would be beneficial, though; current CPUs have tiny
TLBs for gigantic pages, and nobody has been able to measure any real
performance gain from using them.
<p>
There was a bit of back-and-forth between Yan (who works for NVIDIA) and
another NVIDIA developer in the room.  It seems that there might, maybe,
somehow, be interest within the company in using 1GB pages for better
performance in some not-yet-developed product far in the future.  Maybe.
But naturally nobody could actually talk about any such products, and
kernel developers have little interest in trying to support them.
<p>
The session came to an end with Gorman saying that there was no reason to
add new infrastructure for this purpose; <tt>khugepaged</tt> is there
already.  If the kernel's page-migration logic is too slow, the right thing
to do is to make it faster rather than circumventing it.  For example, he
said, there is no effort made to batch migration work currently; it is a
"stupid" implementation.  There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that should
be fixed before thinking about adding a whole new set of machinery.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

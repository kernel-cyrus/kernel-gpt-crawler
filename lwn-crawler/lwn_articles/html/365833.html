<p>
Minimizing the overhead of various kernel debugging and tracing mechanisms
is important for many reasons.  For static instrumentation, like
tracepoints, the impact when they are not enabled must be very low or they
won't get used&mdash;or merged.  In addition, for any kind of
instrumentation, the impact when enabled
needs to be as small as possible so that whatever behavior is under
observation will not radically change due to the tracing.  Two separate
proposals, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/362752/">jump labels</a> for
tracepoints and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/364189/">kprobes jump
optimization</a>, are both trying to reduce the effect that instrumentation
has on performance.  In addition, they share some underlying code.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/343766/">kprobes</a> jump optimization has been proposed by Masami
Hiramatsu, and trades off a bit of extra memory for approximately one-fifth
the overhead in making a kprobe call.  According to Hiramatsu's posting,
kprobes went from 0.68us (32-bit) and 0.91us (64-bit) to 0.06us (both) when
they were optimized with this technique.  kretprobes dropped from 0.95us
(32-bit) and 1.21us (64-bit) to 0.30 and 0.35us respectively.  All of his
testing was done on a 2.33GHz Xeon processor.
</p>

<p>
Those numbers are pretty eye-opening, especially since the optimization
only adds around 200 bytes per probe.  The basic idea is to use a jump
instruction, rather than a breakpoint, to implement probes whenever that is
possible.  The patch includes some fairly elaborate "safety checks" to see
if it is possible to do the optimization.  Before any of that is done,
however, a regular 
breakpoint-based kprobe is inserted&mdash;if the optimization can't be
done, that will be used instead.
</p>

<p>
The jump instruction that will be put at the address to be probed is longer
than one byte, so the optimization step needs to look at the region of code
it will be affecting.  If that region straddles the boundary between
functions (i.e. spills out of the probed function into the next), the
optimization is not done.  It then decodes the function looking for jump
instructions that would&mdash;or could&mdash;jump into the region, if none
are found, the optimization proceeds.
</p>

<p>
The instructions that are located at the address to be probed still need to
be executed once they are replaced by a jump, of course, so a "detour"
buffer is created.  The detour buffer emulates an exception that contains
the instructions copied from the probed location, followed by a jump back
to the original execution path.  This detour buffer will be used once the
kprobe code itself is executed to finish the execution after the probe point.
</p>

<p>
Once the detour buffer has been created, the kprobe is enqueued on the
kprobe-optimizer workqueue, where the actual jump is patched into the probe
site.  The optimizer needs to ensure that there are no interrupts executing
and does so by using <tt>synchronize_sched()</tt> in the workqueue
function.  Once that completes, 
the <tt>text_poke_fixup()</tt> function, which is added as part of the
patchset, is called to actually modify the code to patch the jump in.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/366007/"><tt>text_poke_fixup()</tt> patch</a> is the
piece that is shared with jump labels.  It looks like:
<pre>
    void *text_poke_fixup(void *addr, const void *opcode, size_t len,
                          void *fixup);
</pre>
where <tt>addr</tt> points to the location to change, <tt>opcode</tt> and
<tt>len</tt> specify the new opcode (and its length) to be written there.  <tt>fixup</tt> is
the address where a processor should jump if it hits <tt>addr</tt> while
the modification is in process.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, <tt>text_poke_fixup()</tt> puts a breakpoint that will execute
the code at <tt>fixup</tt> on <tt>addr</tt> 
and synchronizes that on all CPUs. It then modifies all the other bytes
(except the first) of the region, once again synchronizing with the other
CPUs.  The next step is to modify the first byte, again requiring
synchronization, and then it can clear the breakpoint.  Any calls made
during the modification will be routed by the breakpoint to the
<tt>fixup</tt> code instead. 
</p>

<p>
A jump label uses the same technique, but, since it applies to static
instrumentation (tracepoints), it is meant to reduce the impact of the
likely case that the tracepoint is disabled.  It does that by using an
assembly construct that will be available in the soon-to-be-released GCC
4.5, the <tt>asm goto</tt>, which allows branching to labels.
</p>

<p> For a tracepoint, the idea is that the disabled case will consist of a
5-byte NOP (conveniently sized to be overwritten with a jump) followed by a
jump around the disabled tracepoint code.  When the tracepoint gets
enabled, <tt>text_poke_fixup()</tt> is used to turn the NOP into a jump to
the label in the <tt>DECLARE_TRACE()</tt> macro.  That code is what the
original unconditional jump skips over.

<p>
The jump labels patch then has code to manage the state of the tracepoints,
including the labels and addresses, along with the current enabled/disabled
status of the tracepoint.  It is somewhat of a
hackish abuse of the pre-processor and assembler, but according to Jason
Baron, who proposed the patch, it results in "<q>an average improvement
of 30 cycles per-tracepoint on x86_64 systems that I've tested</q>".
</p>

<p>
Jump labels eliminate the current test and jump that is done for each
tracepoint, 
because it can dynamically enable and disable the tracepoint code.  Adding
the NOP and unconditional jump add "<q>2 - 4 cycles on average vs. no
tracepoint</q>", Baron <a href="/Articles/366013/">said</a>, which is
a pretty low cost for this kind of instrumentation.
</p>

<p>
Both of these techniques are likely to need some more "soaking" time before they
are ready for the mainline.  Jump labels is a more recent proposal and
relies on features in a not-yet-released compiler, which would seem to put
it a bit further behind.  The reaction to both has been relatively
positive, though, which probably indicates general agreement with their
goals.  Reducing the overhead for tracing and debugging is something that
few will argue against.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Doesn't kernel already use[1] some kind of a "detour" buffer to execute <br>
the instructions (at least I remember reading about something similar)?  <br>
And isn't this kind of code architecture specific[2], which archs this <br>
patch supports?<br>
<p>
[1] Disabling breakpoint, running the instructions and re-enabling the <br>
breakpoint cannot be used because then there's a race-condition with the <br>
other threads, so the instructions are executed from a buffer set aside <br>
for this purpose.<br>
<p>
[2] there are some instructions which need "emulation" when run from a <br>
different location due to using data at relative offsets.<br>

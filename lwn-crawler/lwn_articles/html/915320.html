           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 2, 2022</br>
           </div>
The software-interrupt mechanism is one of the oldest parts in the kernel;
arguably, the basic design behind it predates Linux itself.  Software
interrupts can get in the way of other work so, for almost as
long as they have existed, developers have wished that they
could be made to go away.  That has never happened, though, and doesn't
look imminent. Instead, Android systems have long carried a patch that
tries to minimize the impact of software interrupts, at least in some
situations.  John Stultz is now <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221116075929.453876-1-jstultz@google.com/">posting
that work</a>, which contains contributions from a number of authors, in
the hope of getting it into the mainline kernel. 

<p>
Hardware interrupts (or just "interrupts") are initiated when a physical
component in the system wants the kernel's attention; they will usually
cause an immediate trap into a special handler function.  Since interrupts
take the system away from whatever else it was doing, interrupt handlers
have to do their work quickly; there is not time for any sort of extended
processing.  This is not a new problem; pre-Linux Unix systems often
included the concept of a "bottom half" as a way of deferring work that
could not be done in an interrupt handler.
<p>
  The Linux kernel, too, has had
to develop mechanisms to defer processing until a more convenient
time. 
One of those mechanisms  is software interrupts (or "softirqs").  It
was first introduced in the 0.99 kernel under the
familiar "bottom half" name; the term "softirq" doesn't appear until the 1.1.77
development release.  The abbreviation "bh" ("bottom half") can still be
found in the names of kernel functions related to software interrupts.
<p>
In the current implementation, there is a
handful of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0.9/source/include/linux/interrupt.h#L542">software-interrupt
"vectors"</a> assigned to specific subsystems. 
When one of those subsystems has to defer
some work, it sets a bit in a per-CPU mask that will cause its
software-interrupt 
handler to be called at a later time.  Often, the software interrupt will
run immediately after the completion of hardware-interrupt handling,
meaning that it runs at a high priority, before just about any other work
in the kernel.  The software-interrupt mechanism is reserved for a handful
of core-kernel subsystems, including networking and the block layer, with
one big exception: the kernel's tasklet mechanism, which is available to
any subsystem, executes tasklets in a software-interrupt handler.
<p>
Software interrupts can create latency in an otherwise well-functioning
system, so they have long drawn the attention of developers interested in
response times.  In kernels configured for realtime preemption, software
interrupts are handled in a process like any other, so their priority can
be set relative to other important tasks.  Most of us do not run realtime
preemption kernels, though, so software-interrupt handling will usually
steal time from other tasks that would like to be running.  Even on normal
systems, though, a system that is generating large numbers of software
interrupts will eventually defer them to the per-CPU <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> kernel
thread.
<p>
Normally, one expects realtime tasks to be the highest-priority work on the
machine, even one that is not running a realtime kernel.  But
software-interrupt handling trumps even realtime tasks and can prevent them
from meeting their deadlines.  The latency that software interrupts
can add has, evidently, been seen to cause
audio glitches on Android systems, inspiring the work being proposed by
Stultz now.
<p>
There are two components to the suggested change, the first of which is a
scheduler tweak to modify its placement of realtime tasks.  Currently, when
a realtime task becomes runnable, the scheduler will search for a CPU that
appears to have sufficient available capacity to run that task; among other
things, that check will prevent the placement of a resource-hungry task on
a slow CPU.  Stultz's patch adds a new check to see whether a candidate CPU
is handling (or is about to handle) a "slow" software interrupt that is
expected to take a fair amount of processing time; for the purposes of this
decision, 
"slow" is defined as being software interrupts from the networking or block
subsystems.  If the CPU is indeed busy in that way, the scheduler will try
to place the realtime task elsewhere so that, with luck, it will gain
access to the CPU more quickly.
<p>
The second piece changes how the kernel chooses to run software-interrupt
handlers.  Normally, those handlers are run as soon as possible on the
current CPU unless the
<tt>ksoftirqd</tt> thread is already running, in which case they will be
queued for handling there instead.  The patch series causes the kernel to
check, before running a software-interrupt handler, 
whether there is currently a realtime task running on the current CPU; if so,
and if the software interrupt is of the "slow" variety, it will be deferred
to <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> so that the realtime task can continue running.
Faster software interrupts (such as those for timers) will still execute
immediately on the current CPU.
<p>
To effect that split, a subtle change was required.  In current kernels, if
<tt>ksoftirqd</tt> is running on a CPU, all software interrupts will be
deferred to
it.  If these changes are active (there is a new kernel configuration
option to control that), "fast" software interrupts will be handled
immediately whether <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> is running or not.  This change was
necessary because the deferral of slower software interrupt handlers, as
added by this patch series, may
cause <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> to be running at times when the overall
software-interrupt load is not high.  With the old test, faster interrupt
handlers could be delayed by an unnecessary deferral to <tt>ksoftirqd</tt>.
The new code, though, could have the potential to <i>not</i> defer software
interrupts at times when they <i>are</i> loading the system.
<p>
The end result of this work is much better latency results with realtime
tests like <a
href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/cyclictest/start">cyclictest</a>.
The patches have been running on Android kernels "<q>for a number of
years</q>" and presumably do not cause problems, at least in that context.
Even so, Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y3S9VH+ThqbUDV4Y@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">is
not entirely happy</a> with this work; it would be better, he suggested, to
simply stop software-interrupt processing when there is a high-priority
task to run.  He has <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/peterz/queue.git/log/?h=core/softirq">a
series of patches</a> that make that kind of change that he had posted
previously, but admitted that the work "<q>fell on its
face due to regressions</q>" at that time.
<p>

Stultz <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CANDhNCrAe8jb73feYhKuiK6pS8Ma1p+W_==kHN6iybsWBkmxUg@mail.gmail.com/">gave
Zijlstra's series a try</a> and concluded that, while it improves the
situation, it does not fully address the problem.  Specifically, it doesn't
help if a single software-interrupt handler runs for a long time, and that
is indeed something that happens.  Thus, he said: "<q>I'm not sure if it
will let us move away from the softirq-rt placement optimization
patches</q>".  Hopefully, some sort of solution that is acceptable to all
of the developers involved will eventually be worked out.
Otherwise, the outcome may end up being that Android
continues to carry this patch series for several more years.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Are the hardware buffer so small on laptop/desktop that the kernel has deadlines missed (underrun) due to software interrupt?<br>
While Android has low latency audio with 2/4ms deadlines, for music playback (especially on a laptop) a much deeper buffer should be used (for both power and performance reason).<br>
I don't know much about the x86 audio subsystem, is the audio ring buffer between north bridge and the ADSP in the south bridge not shared memory? Which would allow for a big enough buffer size (100ms+) to not be impacted by the kernel scheduling (at least for non latency sensitive use case).<br>

I don't remember ever having a problem with smooth audio playback on Linux desktop or laptop in the last decade.<br>
Even though most of these systems have (had) "spinning rust" HDDs, which are known for their high latency.<br>
But I only use raw ALSA, not stuff like PulseAudio.<br>
<p>
Something has to be seriously broken in Fedora then.<br>
Or your system is running out of memory, has crazy high CPU load or is forced to run at a very low power state for some reason.<br>

      <i>pre-Linux Unix systems often included the concept of a "bottom half" as a way of deferring work that could not be done in an interrupt handler.</i><p>
Actually, pre-Linux systems called this the "top half"; the "bottom half" was the interrupt handler. See e.g. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/plan9-bell-labs/7thEdMan/v7vol2b.pdf">UNIX PROGRAMMER’S MANUAL Seven Edition</a>. This reflected the classic stack model: hardware at the bottom, user code at the top. When I first worked on Linux mumble years ago, this was a quite a source of confusion.

Relevant paragraph:<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; A number of subroutines are available which are useful to character device drivers. Most of these handlers, for example, need a place to buffer characters in the internal interface between their ‘‘top half’’ (read/write) and ‘‘bottom half’’ (interrupt) routines.

Oh, what I meant to say is that traditional Unix didn't need to distinguish between hard and soft interrupt context. That very document talks about the priority level of interrupts (spl4() thought spl7()). That meant that higher priority interrupts could interrupt lower priority interrupts. As far as I know, x86 didn't (and maybe still doesn't) support that. So Linux disables all interrupts while processing any interrupt, which means that all interrupt routines must be fast and defer anything time-consuming to softirq context (which can be interrupted by hardirqs)<br>

Interrupt priority levels aren't supported in x86??<br>
That's an interesting choice, given that I've been working with the decade-old PIC32MX processor, which support 7 levels of interrupts-interrupting-interrupts (ie, a handler for priority-1 interrupts can be interrupted by one for priority-2, so on and so forth). <br>
<p>
On reflection, the answer to the issue seems clear; while some PIC32 processsors have a second set of registers for holding the interrupted execution context, most don't.  That means all interrupts need to save and load every CPU register to memory when starting and stopping; which is a pretty significant chunk of overhead.  Having multiple interrupt levels isn't much of a cost on top of that, then.<br>
<p>
But I'll bet money that x86 doesn't make that 'shadow register set' optional.  And while the simplest AMD64 processor is miles ahead of the most sophisticated PIC32, a complete set of registers is still not a small addition; and why bother having multiple extra sets if one will do? <br>

Sounds like a feature I believe the 68000 had would not go amiss here ...<br>
<p>
I seem to remember it stored its registers in main ram, with a register that specified the base address. Surely it must have cached them in the cpu for speed, but changing that base register would have done a "flush and restore", so you could simply assign a block of ram as a register stack.<br>

That's very definitely not the Motorola 68000 (the A24D16-bussed 32-bit microprocessor from 1979 with three zeroes in its model number).<br>
<p>
It sounds like the Motorola 6809, an enhanced version of the Motorola 6800 (the A16D8-bussed 8-bit microprocessor from 1974 with two zeroes in its model number).<br>
<p>
The 6800's actual registers (8-bit accumulators A and B; 16-bit index register X; 16-bit stack pointer SP; 16-bit program counter PC; 8-bit status register with the two high bits hard-wired to 1) were on-chip. However, it had a "zero page" addressing mode for memory access, which took an 8-bit address and zero-extended it to 16 bits. The speed penalty for going to RAM was a lot lower then than it would be today, so you could use the zero page as "pseudoregisters".<br>
<p>
Among other enhancements, the 6809 relabelled the "Zero Page" addressing mode as "Direct Page" and added an 8-bit Direct Page register that controlled the high eight bits of the address presented on the bus when using that addressing mode.<br>

The Motorola 68k has the MOVEM instruction which takes a list of registers (a bitmap) to copy to/from consecutive memory locations. The same mnemonic is used for both directions; the assembler determines the variant based on the operands. The instruction does not use a dedicated base register for this, but you can choose from a range of addressing modes for the memory operand. The 68000 is a CISC processor, after all.<br>

      <p>The TMS9900 has only three on-chip registers: Program Counter (PC), Status Register (SR), and Workspace Pointer (WP). It then has instructions that operate on 16-bit registers, which are memory relative to the address in WP - so R0 is actually the two bytes at WP and WP + 1, while R12 is the two bytes at WP + 24 and WP + 25. All ALU operations work on numbered registers, not on the three internal registers, and indirect addressing is also relative to the WP relative registers, not one of the internal three. PC and SR work like in other processors; WP has a dedicated load-immediate and store to register instruction pair, plus can be modified by BLWP (branch and load workspace pointer) and RTWP (return with workspace pointer)
<p>An equivalent behaviour on a modified 6809 would be if changing the Direct Page register also changed D, X, Y, U and S - i.e. changing DP changes all but PC and condition code registers in the 6809.

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Interrupt priority levels aren't supported in x86??</span><br>
<p>
I'm not an expert but after reading a bit, I think it's roughly:<br>
<p>
They are supported by the hardware, but Linux doesn't make much use of them.<br>
<p>
On x86-64, there is TPR (task-priority register; writeable) and PPR (processor-priority register; read-only; basically the max of TPR and the currently-active interrupt's priority). An interrupt's 8-bit vector number is used as its priority. The top 4 bits are the priority class. The CPU will only handle an interrupt with a priority class higher than PPR. That means an interrupt can only be preempted by one of higher priority than itself, and TPR can be used to mask all interrupts up to a given priority (e.g. a kernel critical section can disable most interrupts, but still allow preemption by the highest-priority ones to meet certain real-time requirements).<br>
<p>
As far as I can tell, x86-64 made TPR more easily accessible (through the CR8 register) but the basic functionality is the same as any x86 since Pentium (specifically ones with APIC).<br>
<p>
When an interrupt occurs, the CPU will push EIP/EFLAGS/etc to the stack and clear the IF flag (to disable all interrupts) before running the handler. The handler obviously needs to preserve any other registers on the stack before clobbering them. The handler may do some work and then choose to set IF, to allow itself to be preempted by a higher-priority interrupt. Or it may choose not to. It sounds like Linux used to support nested interrupts but removed it in 2010, because of the complexity of preventing stack overflows: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/380931/">https://lwn.net/Articles/380931/</a> . (...except the posts in that article make it sound like interrupts on the same vector can nest, and I thought PPR would prevent that? I'm probably confused about something.)<br>
<p>
For comparison, I think ARMv7-A/ARMv8-A are similar to x86, except the CPU does not push anything onto the stack - it just copies PC and status register (CPSR/PSTATE) into some special registers. The handler must preserve those on the stack before allowing preemption.<br>
<p>
ARMv6/7/8-M are different: they don't disable interrupts before running the handler, so all handlers are preemptible by default. The CPU pushes several registers onto the stack on exception entry, and it can even be preempted in the middle of that entry sequence. That allows lower-latency handling of high-priority interrupts.<br>

      Takes me back. My first post-college job in the late 1980s was helping port V7 UNIX (designed to run on a 68000 board with a segment MMU) to a 68010 (with support for restarting instructions on bus errors - so that sbrk() and brk() could be handled automatically and gracefully without special coordination with the C compiler). We ended up having some complex scheduling and input needs so we ported in bits of BSD into it including a bespoke implementation of select(), the full BSD socket API and network stack. I suppose we should have just tried porting BSD in the first place. It was lots of fun though. Not any hard real-time tasks for that project, but it controlled devices that were hard real-time in hardware.

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 20, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring subsystem</a> has, in the last
year, redefined how asynchronous I/O is done on Linux systems.  As this
subsystem grows in both capability and users, though, it starts to run into
limitations in the types of operations that can be expressed.  That is
driving a number of changes in how operations are programmed for io_uring.
One example is the mechanisms considered for carrying a file descriptor
between operations that was <a
href="/Articles/813827/">covered here</a> in early March.  Another has to
do with how I/O buffers are chosen for operations.
<p>
As io_uring developer Jens Axboe describes in <a
href="/ml/io-uring/20200310150427.28489-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">this patch
set</a>, the usual mode for programs that handle large numbers of file
descriptors is to use <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html"><tt>poll()</tt></a>
to find out which descriptors are ready for I/O, then making separate calls
to actually perform that I/O.  One could use io_uring in this mode, but it
defeats one of the purposes of the whole exercise: avoiding system calls
whenever possible.  The io_uring way of doing things is to just queue an
asynchronous operation on every file descriptor, then react to the
resulting events whenever one of those operations is executed.
<p>
Working that way can indeed reduce system calls â€” all the way to zero if
the request ring is kept full.  But it also requires allocating a separate
I/O buffer for each of those queued operations, even though many of them
may not execute for an indefinite period of time.  The <tt>poll()</tt>
method, instead, allows an application to defer buffer allocation until a
buffer is actually needed.  Losing that flexibility can result in
significantly higher memory use for applications that keep a large number
of operations outstanding.
<p>
What is needed here is some sort of mechanism that allows buffers to be
allocated to operations after they have been queued in the ring.  The
answer is, of course, obvious: add a hook for a BPF program that can
perform buffer management in the kernel at the moment that any particular
operation is able to go forward.  Why even try anything else?
Unfortunately, Axboe said, "<q>I had a hard time imagining how life
times of the buffer could be managed through [BPF]</q>", so that idea
went by the wayside.
<p>
Fortunately, there was another idea waiting in the wings: have the
application provide one or more buffer pools to io_uring, which would then
select a buffer from one of those pools whenever one is needed.  That is
what Axboe ended up implementing.
<p>
To use this mechanism, an application starts by queuing one or more
<tt>IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS</tt> operations to give a set of I/O buffers
to the kernel.  Each operation includes the base address of the buffer(s),
a count of buffers, the size (the same for all buffers in this operation),
a base buffer ID, and a group ID.  If more than one buffer is included in
the request, the buffer ID will be incremented by one for each after the
first.  There is no requirement that all buffers in a given group be the
same size, but that seems to be the way that the mechanism is intended to
be used.
<p>
Subsequently, operations can be queued without providing buffers at
submission time; 
instead, the special value <tt>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT</tt> is used.  The new
<tt>buf_group</tt> field in the queue entry should be set to the ID of the
group from which a buffer should be obtained when needed.  When an
operation unblocks and can proceed, the kernel will grab a buffer from the
indicated group and use it.  The size of the buffer is not considered
during the selection process so, if the buffer is too small, the operation
will not be able to complete properly.  The ID of the selected buffer is
returned with the operation's completion status.
<p>
If the requested buffer group is empty, the operation will fail with an
<tt>ENOBUFS</tt> error.  Once a buffer has been consumed by an operation,
the kernel will not use it again until it has been given back with another
<tt>IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS</tt> request.
<p>
Only some operations support buffer selection in the current patch set; it
is limited to <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>readv()</tt>, <tt>recv()</tt>, and
<tt>recvmsg()</tt>.  Earlier versions of the patch set supported
<tt>write()</tt>, though your editor will freely admit to being baffled
with regard to how that was supposed to actually work even after looking at
the code; that support was
removed in <a
href="/ml/io-uring/20200228203053.25023-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">version&nbsp;3</a>.
<p>
This work has not yet found its way into linux-next, but there is still
some time before the 5.7 merge window opens.  So there is a chance that the
buffer-selection feature could yet land in the next development cycle.
That will increase the flexibility of io_uring operations, and no BPF hooks
are required.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I would <i>guess</i> there's not much yet outside of company data centers.  Some of the features we are seeing, including the buffer selection one, are being influenced by the needs of the in-progress PostgreSQL support work, though.

I had a vision that for example Rust's new async-await could have an IO scheuler, in addition to the task scheduler, which would automagically use io_uring behind the scenes (and a compat one for older kernels). I have no idea if this is actually happening, but this is such a brilliant idea that they absolutely should do it ;)<br>

I'n confused by the description  regarding buffer size. Initially it's claimed that all buffers  must have identical size, presumably because in the struct describing the request there is a single size_t: <br>

The very next sentence mentions: There is no requirement that all buffers in a given group be the same size . I assume one IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS call provides 1 group of N buffers. So which one is true?<br>

      Both are true.  You can make multiple <tt>IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS</tt> calls to add buffers to the same group; indeed, that will be the normal mode of operation assuming that buffers are used more than once.  Different calls can provide different sizes.

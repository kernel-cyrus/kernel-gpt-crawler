As is suggested by its name, persistent memory (or non-volatile memory) is
characterized by the 
persistence of the data stored in it.  But that term could just as well be
applied to the discussions surrounding it; persistent memory raises a
number of interesting development problems that will take a while to work
out yet.  One of the key points of discussion at the moment is whether
persistent memory should, like ordinary RAM, be represented by
<tt>page</tt> structures and, if so, how those structures should be
managed.
<p>
One <a href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>page</tt> structure</a> exists for each
page of (non-persistent) physical memory in the system.  It tracks how the
page is used and, 
among other things, contains a reference count describing how many users
the page has.  A pointer to a <tt>page</tt> structure is an unambiguous way
to refer to a specific physical page independent of any address space, so
it is perhaps unsurprising that this structure is used with many APIs in
the kernel.  Should a range of memory exist that lacks corresponding
<tt>page</tt> structures, that memory cannot be used with any API expecting
a <tt>struct page</tt> pointer; among other things, that rules out DMA and
direct I/O.
<p>
Persistent memory looks like ordinary memory to the CPU in a number of
ways.  In particular, it is directly addressable at the byte level.  It
differs, though, in its persistence, its performance characteristics
(writes, in particular, can be slow), and its size — persistent memory
arrays are expected to be measured in terabytes.  At a 4KB page size,
billions of <tt>page</tt> structures would be needed to represent this kind
of memory array — too many to manage efficiently. As a result, 
currently, persistent memory is treated like a device, rather than like memory;
among other things, that means that the kernel does not need to maintain
<tt>page</tt> structures for 
persistent memory.  Many things can be made to work without them, but this
aspect of persistent memory does bring some limitations; one of those is
that it is not currently possible to perform I/O directly between
persistent memory and another device.  That, in turn, thwarts use cases
like using persistent memory as a cache between the system and a large,
slow storage array.
<p>
<h4>Page-frame numbers</h4>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/643437/">One approach to the problem</a>, posted by Dan
Williams, is to change the relevant APIs to do away with the need for
<tt>page</tt> structures.  This patch set creates a new type called
<tt>__pfn_t</tt>:
<P>
<pre>
    typedef struct {
	union {
	    unsigned long data;
	    struct page *page;
	};
    __pfn_t;
</pre>
<p>
As is suggested by the use of a union type, this structure leads a sort of
double life.  It can contain a <tt>page</tt> pointer as usual, but it can
also be used to hold an integer page frame number (PFN).  The two cases are
distinguished by setting one of the low bits in the <tt>data</tt> field;
the alignment requirements 
for <tt>page</tt> structures guarantee that those bits will be clear for an
actual <tt>struct page</tt> pointer.
<p>
A small set of helper functions has been provided to obtain the information
from this structure.  A call to <tt>__pfn_t_to_pfn()</tt> will obtain the
associated PFN (regardless of which type of data the structure holds),
while <tt>__pfn_t_to_page()</tt> will return a <tt>struct page</tt>
pointer, but only if a page structure exists.  These helpers support the
main goal for the <tt>__pfn_t</tt> type: to allow the lower levels of the
I/O stack to be converted to use PFNs as the primary way to describe memory
while avoiding massive changes to the upper layers where <tt>page</tt>
structures are used.
<p>
With that infrastructure in place, the block layer is changed to use
<tt>__pfn_t</tt> instead of <tt>struct page</tt>; in particular, the
<tt>bio_vec</tt> structure, which describes a segment of I/O, becomes:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bio_vec {
        __pfn_t         bv_pfn;
        unsigned short  bv_len;
        unsigned short  bv_offset;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The ripple effects from this change end up touching nearly 80 files in the
filesystem and block subtrees.  At a lower level, there are changes to the
scatter/gather DMA API to allow buffers to be specified using PFNs rather
than <tt>page</tt> structures; this change has architecture-specific
components to enable the mapping of buffers by PFN.
<p>
Finally, there is the problem of enabling <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> on
PFN-specified pages.  <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> maps a page into the kernel's
address space; it is only really needed on 32-bit systems where there is
not room to map all of main memory into that space.  On 64-bit systems it
is essentially a no-op, turning a <tt>page</tt> structure into its
associated kernel virtual address.  That problem gets a little trickier
when persistent memory is involved; the only code that really knows where
that memory is mapped is the low-level device driver.  Dan's patch set adds
a function by which the driver can inform the rest of the kernel of the
mapping between a range of PFNs and kernel space; <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> is
then adapted to use that information.
<p>
All together, this patch set is enough to enable direct block I/O to
persistent memory.  Linus's <a href="/Articles/644112/">initial
response</a> was on the negative side, though; he said "<q>I detest this
approach</q>".  Instead, he argued in favor of a solution where special
<tt>page</tt> structures are created for ranges of persistent memory when
they are needed.  As the discussion went on, though, he <a
href="/Articles/644113/">moderated</a> his position, saying: "<q>So while
I (very obviously) have some doubts about this approach, it may be that the
most convincing argument is just in the code.</q>"  That code has since
been <a href="/Articles/643998/">reposted</a> with some changes, but the
discussion is not yet finished.
<p>
<h4>Back to page structures</h4>
<p>
Various alternatives have been suggested, but the most attention was
probably drawn by Ingo Molnar's "<a href="/Articles/644114/">Directly
mapped pmem integrated into the page cache</a>" proposal.  The core of
Ingo's idea is that all persistent memory would have <tt>page</tt>
structures, but those structures would be stored in the persistent memory
itself.  The kernel would carve out a piece of each persistent memory array
for these structures; that memory would be hidden from filesystem code.
<p>
Despite being stored in persistent memory, the <tt>page</tt> structures
themselves would not be persistent — a point that a number of commenters
seemed to miss.  Instead, they would be initialized at boot time, using a
lazy technique so that this work would not overly slow the boot process as
a whole.  All filesystem I/O would be direct I/O; in this picture, the
kernel's page cache has little involvement.  The potential benefits are
huge: vast amounts of memory would be available for fast I/O without many
of the memory-management issues that make life difficult for developers
today.
<p>
It is an interesting vision, and it may yet bear fruit, but various
developers were quick to point out that things are not quite as simple as
Ingo would like them to be.  Matthew Wilcox, who has done much of the work
to make filesystems work properly with persistent memory, <a
href="/Articles/644117/">noted</a> that there is an interesting disconnect
between the lifecycle of a page-cache page and that of a block on disk.
Filesystems have the ability to reassign blocks independently of any memory
that might represent the content of those blocks at any given time.  But in
this directly mapped view of the world, filesystem blocks and pages of
memory are the same thing; synchronizing changes to the two could be an
interesting challenge.
<p>
Dave Chinner <a href="/Articles/644118/">pointed out</a> that the
directly mapped approach makes any sort of data transformation by the
filesystem (such as compression or encryption) impossible.  In Dave's view,
the filesystem <a href="/Articles/644120/">needs to have a stronger
role</a> in how persistent memory is managed in general.  The idea of just
using existing filesystems (as Ingo had suggested) to get the best
performance out of persistent memory is, in his view, not sustainable.
Ingo, instead, seems to feel that management of persistent memory could be
mostly hidden from filesystems, just like the management of ordinary memory
is.
<p>
In any case, the proof of this idea would be in the code that implements
it, and, currently, no such code exists.
About the only thing that can be concluded from this discussion is that the
kernel community still has not figured out the best ways of dealing with
large persistent-memory arrays.  Likely as not, it will take some years of
experience with the actual hardware to figure that out.  Approaches like
Dan's might just be merged as a way to make things work for now.  The
best way to make use of such memory in the long term remains undetermined,
though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

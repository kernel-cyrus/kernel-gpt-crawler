It can be tempting to dismiss scalability work as being of interest mainly
to companies running massive server systems; most "ordinary" Linux users
are not running into the kind of problems that scalability-oriented
developers are trying to fix.  But, of course, the truth of the matter is
that those users haven't encountered those problems <i>yet</i>.  The past
work of scalability-oriented developers is what makes our current desktop
and laptop systems work as well as they do; their current work will enable
next year's consumer-level systems.  So Nick Piggin's Japan Linux Symposium
talk on virtual filesystem scalability will be of interest to anybody who
anticipates using Linux in the future.
<p>
That said, one of the key constraints on scalability work is that it must
not worsen performance on current systems.  So Nick is taking care that his
VFS work will improve scalability with no impact on single-threaded
performance.  Beyond that, he is aiming to improve scalability within a
single filesystem - forcing system administrators to split their
filesystems to get better performance would be cheating.  To get there, he
has identified five specific bottlenecks which must be addressed.
<p>
The first of those is <b><tt>files_lock</tt></b>; it is, he says, the
easiest to fix.  This global lock protects a per-superblock list of open
files; it is needed by the file open and close paths.  As the number of
threads grows, this lock limits the scalability of filesystem-oriented
workloads.  The lock itself is only part of the problem; the real issue is
that a single <tt>list_head</tt> is never going to be scalable in
multiprocessor situations.  In this case, it turns out that the kernel
almost never needs to read the full list of open files; that only happens
at unmount time.  So turning the single list into a per-CPU list is a
viable option; it eliminates the locking altogether and makes the
management of the list scalable.  The only tricky part is when files are
removed; that requires cross-CPU access to the list.
<p>
Next on the list is <b><tt>vfsmount_lock</tt></b>, which is used when
finding mounts from directory entry ("dentry") structures.  This lock is
taken when crossing mount points in the path lookup process; it is also
used at mount and unmount time.  Pathname lookup is clearly a
performance-critical path in the kernel, so getting rid of a global lock
can only be a good thing.  Nick considered using read-copy-update
(RCU) for pathname lookup, but he found it to still be too slow.  Part of
the problem  
is the need to block all readers at unmount time, something that RCU cannot
do on its own.
<p>
The solution is to go to per-CPU locks.  Nick has introduced a variant
on per-CPU locks called <a href="/Articles/360206/">brlocks</a>, or "big
reader locks."  These locks share the name and goal of the <a
href="/Articles/360211/">2.4.x brlocks</a> which were removed in the 2.5
development cycle, but the implementation is different.  Essentially, a
brlock is per-CPU for read access, but write access excludes all other
users on all CPUs.  Since pathname lookup is a read-only operation, brlocks
will be fast where the kernel needs them to be; unmounts will be slow, but
those are relatively rare operations.
<p>
<b><tt>mnt_count</tt></b> is a per-filesystem reference count, incremented
for each open and decremented for each close.  Like the global list
described above, this
global counter limits the scalability of opens and closes.  Once again,
going per-CPU is the obvious solution here, with the minor problem that a

<a href="/Articles/360242/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/ks-jls-09/nick-piggin-sm.jpg" width=125 height=143
alt="[Nick Piggin]" border=0 align="right" hspace=2></a>

<tt>put()</tt> operation must check whether the (global) count is zero.
But, as it happens, that case only comes about when the filesystem is not
actually mounted, so this check need not be performed most of the time.
<p>
The hardest one to fix is <b><tt>dcache_lock</tt></b>.  Most VFS operations
need it, with the sole exception of name lookup, which has used RCU for a
while now.  Some operations - LRU scanning and reclaim in the dentry cache
in particular - can hold the lock for a long time.  And the lock covers a
whole bunch of different - and sometimes unknown - things.  The exporting
of <tt>dcache_lock</tt> to filesystems has not helped here; individual
filesystems are using it for their own, not always clear, ends.  So a
developer trying to bring dcache_lock under control must start by trying to
figure out what it is being used to protect.
<p>
Nick has done his best to split apart the various locking cases; these
include the dentry cache hash, the dentry LRU list, the inode dentry alias
list, various statistics, etc.  Some of this stuff is moved under the
protection of the per-dentry spinlock (<tt>d_lock</tt>); other things, like
the dentry hash and LRU, get new locks.  There are a lot of problems still,
starting with lock-ordering challenges.  Nick is working around some of
these using non-blocking "trylock" operations, but that kind of code tends
to be hard to merge.  The various locking cases are still not truly
independent from each other; among other things, that imposes more ordering
requirements.  And walking up the directory tree (trying to determine a
path name from a dentry, usually) becomes much harder in the absence of a
global lock.
<p>
In summary, cleaning up <tt>dcache_lock</tt> looks like a long and messy
project.  This is just the lock which is showing up as the worst bottleneck
in some situations, though, so the work needs to be done.
<p>
Finally, there is the matter of <b><tt>inode_lock</tt></b>, which is needed
by most inode operations (lookup, creation, destruction, writeback, sync,
etc).  As with <tt>dcache_lock</tt>, Nick has split the locking into a
number of independent classes - the inode itself, the inode hash, the LRU
list, and so on.  Some of these classes are moved under the per-inode lock,
while specific locks have been added for some cases.  The per-superblock
inode list has been made into a per-CPU variable, as have the counters used
to generate statistics.  Nick has also made the allocation of inode numbers
into a per-CPU operation by assigning a range of numbers to each
processor.  This means that inode numbers are no longer allocated
sequentially; it's not clear whether that will be a problem or not.
<p>
So what comes of all this work?  Nick claims "great" open/close
scalability, and "good" create/unlink scalability.  He showed the results
of running a microbenchmark which just did <tt>close(open(path))</tt>
repeatedly; with current mainline, he was able to get 450 operations/second
on each of 64 CPUs.  With the scalability patches added, that rate went up
to over 300,000 operations/second - a significant improvement.  Running
<tt>unlink(creat(path))</tt> shows better scalability even with two CPUs -
but it does, for some reason, impose a cost on single-threaded workloads on
the ia-64 architecture.
<p>
The VFS scalability work is clearly worth doing; we'll all be glad that
these problems have been ironed out someday.  But there's still some messy
things to clean up, so this patch set (or the gnarlier parts of it, anyway)
may take a while on their way into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

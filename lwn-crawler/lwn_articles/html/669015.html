<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 23, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel project is famously willing to change any internal interface as
needed for the long-term maintainability of the code.  Effects on
out-of-tree modules or other external code are not generally deemed to be 
reasons to keep an interface stable.  But what happens if you want to
change one of the oldest interfaces found within the kernel — one with
many hundreds of call sites?  It turns out that, in 2015, the appetite for
interface churn may not be what it once was.
<p>
If one looks at <a
href="https://github.com/zavg/linux-0.01/blob/master/mm/memory.c"><tt>mm/memory.c</tt></a>
in the Linux&nbsp;0.01 release, one finds that a page of memory is
allocated with:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long get_free_page(void);
</pre>
<p>
From the memory-management point of view, the system's RAM can be seen as
a linear array of pages, so it can make a certain amount of sense to think
of addresses as integer types — indexes into the array, essentially.
Integers can also be used for arbitrary arithmetic; pointers in C can be
used that way too, but one quickly gets into "undefined behavior" territory
where an overly enthusiastic compiler may feel entitled to create all kinds
of mayhem.  So <tt>unsigned long</tt> was established as the return type
from <tt>get_free_page()</tt> and, in general, as the way that one refers
to an address that may appear in any place in memory.
<p>
Fast-forward to the 4.4-rc6 release and dig through a rather larger body of
code, and one finds that pages are allocated with:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long __get_free_pages(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order);
    unsigned long __get_free_page(gfp_t gfp_mask);
</pre>
<p>
The latter is a macro calling the former with an <tt>order</tt> of zero.
Note that, more than 24 years after the 0.01 release, <tt>unsigned
long</tt> is still used as the return type from
<tt>__get_free_pages()</tt>.  There are other variants
(<tt>alloc_pages()</tt>, for example) that return <tt>struct page</tt>
pointers, but much of low-level, page-oriented memory management in Linux
is still done with <tt>unsigned long</tt> values.
<p>
The only problem is that, often, the kernel must deal with a page of memory
as <i>memory</i>, modifying its contents.  That requires a pointer.  So
even back in 0.01, one can find code like:
<p>
<pre>
    p = (struct task_struct *) get_free_page();
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>unsigned long</tt> return value is immediately cast into the
pointer value that is actually needed.
Al Viro did a survey of <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt> users in current
kernels and <a href="/Articles/669016/">concluded</a> that "<q>well
above 90%</q>" of the callers were using the return value as a pointer.
That turns out to be a lot of casts, suggesting that the type of the
return value for this function is not correct.  So, he suggested, it might
make sense to change it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In other words, switching to void * for return values of allocating
	and argument of freeing functions would reduce the amount of
	boilerplate quite nicely.  What's more, fewer casts means better
	chance for typechecking to catch more bugs.
</div>
<p>
Some of those bugs, he pointed out, he found simply by looking at the code
with this kind of transformation in mind.  Ten days later, he showed up
with <a href="/Articles/668852/">a patch set</a> making the change and
asked for a verdict from Linus.
<p>
One might find various faults with <a href="/Articles/669017/">Linus's
response</a>, but a lack of clarity will not be among them.  He left no
doubt that there was no place in the mainline for this particular patch
set.  The diffstat in Al's patch (568 files changed, 1956 insertions, 2202
deletions) was clearly frightening — enough, in its own right, to rule
out the change.  A patch this wide-ranging would create conflicts
throughout the tree and make life difficult for those backporting patches.
This interface, it seems, is too old and too entrenched for this kind of
flag-day change; as Linus put it: "<q>No way in hell do we suddenly
change the semantics of an interface that has been around from basically
day&nbsp;#1.</q>"
<p>
Still, as he <a href="/Articles/669018/">clarified</a> afterward, Linus
isn't arguing for leaving everything exactly as it is.  He accepted that
most callers likely want a pointer value.  But the way forward isn't to
thrash up an interface like <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt>; instead, there are
two approaches that, he said, could be taken.
<p>
The first of these would be to create a new, pointer-oriented interface
that exists in parallel with <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt>.  Then call sites
could be converted at leisure over the course of what would probably be
years.
<p>
The alternative, Linus said, is that code needing pointers could just
allocate memory with <tt>kmalloc()</tt> instead.  Once upon a time, that
would not necessarily have been a good idea, since <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
(implemented by the slab allocators) adds overhead to the page allocator
and might have expanded the size of the returned memory beyond one page.
Indeed, there was a period where an allocation of exactly one page would
have consumed two physically contiguous pages when the slab housekeeping
information was added.  But those days are long in the past.  In current
kernels, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is fast and requires little memory beyond that
which is actually allocated.  Indeed, Linus pointed out, <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
may actually be faster than <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt> due to its use of
per-CPU object caches.
<p>
So <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is probably the best option for many of the
call sites currently using <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt>.  The places where
it is still inappropriate will be those needing multiple-page allocations
and those needing allocations that are not only page-sized but
page-aligned.  In those cases, Linus said, the <tt>unsigned long</tt>
return type might not be a bad thing, since "<q>it's clearly not just a
random pointer allocation if the bit pattern of the pointer
matters.</q>"
<p>
After this discussion took place, Al did <a href="/Articles/669020/">a
pass over</a> the <tt>__get_free_pages()</tt> call sites in the filesystem
code and concluded that almost all of them truly would would be better off
using <tt>kmalloc()</tt>.  So the 
end result of this work may be a slow shift in that direction and, perhaps,
the creation of a new document telling kernel developers which memory
allocator they should be using in which setting.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

True. The current implementation does align, and it's hard to think of sensible implementation that wouldn't for page size alloc. But article suggests it wasn't like this before, and there's no stated guarantee AFAIK. <br>
<p>
BTW, page allocator also has per cpu caches, so that's not advantage of kmalloc. <br>

It does seem Linus is unnecessarily rude. As he points out he might not know how many ways there are to say NO but I am sure he can find a slightly less strong and harsh one. Al tried something he believed was worthwhile, Linus disagreed. No reason to start yelling right away...<br>
<p>
Al might not mind but as often - others watch and might not be interested in getting yelled at like that so that super clever cleanup/optimization they were thinking about might never be proposed. And that is a waste for no reason.<br>

      <p>Perhaps I'm confused...</p>

<blockquote><font class="QuotedText">The <tt>unsigned long</tt> return value is immediately cast into the pointer value that is actually needed.</font></blockquote>

<p>Isn't it already a pointer?  I thought that the C language standard specifies that memory addresses (physical <em>or</em> virtual) be represented as an unsigned long integral primitive type<sup>1</sup>.  Plus, Mel Gorman's <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand009.html">documentation on these functions</a> even states that these functions return a &quot;virtual address&quot; (&sect; 6.2).</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm needlessly arguing English language semantics here instead of C.  The gist of my post is that an <tt>unsigned long</tt> and a <tt>void *</tt> are the same thing to the compiler, but if they're not, then all these casts exist merely to shut up the compiler.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I may be wrong on this; apparently <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Reference_Tables#Table_of_Data_Types">ANSI/C89</a> makes no mention of storage of memory address types (i.e. pointers) as a primitive type, but instead as a <em>derived</em> type.</p>

"The following type designates an unsigned integer type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type, then converted back to pointer to<br>
void, and the result will compare equal to the original pointer: uintptr_t<br>
These types [intptr_t and uintptr_t] are optional"<br>
<p>
IOW, not only they are different (hell, try to compile something like 2 * &amp;n and see where the compiler tells you to shove it), they are not even guaranteed to be possible to convert back and forth.<br>
<p>
On all architectures supported by Linux, such a type exists and happens to be unsigned long.  So casts back and forth are possible.  But void * and unsigned long are certainly *not* the same thing - the sets of operations valid for them are quite different.<br>

      Those who have worked with segmented memory models have learned this the hard way. The MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows "large" memory model was an easy introduction, since there far pointers and longs are still the same size, even though the pointer is not a simple linear number. But then I encountered a 32-bit segmented Intel system, where pointers are 6 bytes (2 byte selector, 4 byte offset), but longs still 4 bytes... Teaches one to take C prototype declarations seriously.

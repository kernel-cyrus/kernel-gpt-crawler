<p>
A <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000400.html">proposal</a>
from Cong Wang
to discuss the various mechanisms to store the kernel's "dying breath"
spawned a rather large thread on the ksummit-2012-discuss mailing list.
While things like <a href="/Articles/434821/">pstore</a> were set up specifically
to provide a means to store kernel crash information, that doesn't
necessarily make it easy for users to access and report kernel
crashes.  That led to suggestions and discussion of better ways for users
to get the information out of their crashed systems&mdash;including using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code">QR
codes</a> to facilitate the process.
</p>

<p>
Most regular users do not have a serial console set up to record crash
information on a separate machine.  So the kernel backtrace that appears
after a crash is just written to the console, which means that much of it
will have scrolled off the screen.  Even the data that is there is hard to
extract, with some folks trying to type the information in, which is
tedious, not to mention error-prone.  A QR code that encoded the relevant
data could certainly help there.


<p>
Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk was the first to <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000443.html">broach
the QR code idea</a>, though he said it did not originate with him.  It
turns out that H. Peter Anvin and Dirk Hohndel have been "<a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000494.html">messing
with</a>" the idea, but Will Deacon and Marc Zyngier actually <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000564.html">showed</a>
something along those lines at the recent Linaro Connect in Hong Kong.
Deacon was <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000581.html">hesitant
to call it a prototype</a>, but said that there was some work done on
encoding a kernel crash backtrace as a QR code.  There were two
problems with their approach:
<div class="BigQuote">
<ol>
<li>
  Even without any error correction, the QR code started to get pretty
     large (and unreadable) after more than a few lines of backtrace. This
     should be fairly easy to fix by encoding the data in a more sensible
     manner rather than just verbatim (especially since a backtrace is
     a well-structured log). Maybe you could even gzip the whole thing after
     that too (then sell an android app to gunzip it :p)
<li>
<p>
  Displaying the QR code on a panic could be problematic. We tried using
     the ASCII option of libqrencode but we couldn't find any phone that
     would read the result. So we need a way to get to the framebuffer once
     we've sawn our head off (maybe this is easier with x86 and VGA modes?).
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the original <a href="/Articles/218380/">motivations</a> for kernel
modesetting (KMS) was to get readable oops information to the screen.
Using KMS to display a fairly simple QR code graphic instead should be
workable, rather than creating an ASCII version as Deacon describes.
Matthew Garrett <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000557.html">noted</a>
that it should be fairly straightforward at least for hardware that has KMS
support: 
<div class="BigQuote">
KMS already has atomic modeswitch support for showing panics. We'd just 
need to ensure that there's an unaccelerated path for dumping contents 
directly to the framebuffer. If you don't have KMS then you don't get to 
play with modern useful functionality.
</div>

<p>
There is some disagreement about where the decoding of any QR code should
take place.  Garrett <a href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000590.html">believes</a> that existing QR
apps in phones should be used, while others are not convinced they can be
coerced into being flexible enough to deal with the large QR codes that might
result from a kernel backtrace.  Garrett has also done some work on the problem
and <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000459.html">described</a>
his approach:
<div class="BigQuote">
Basic design was as follows: Take the backtrace, compress it, encode in 
an alphanumeric QR code including an http:// prefix, submit to 
http://kbu.gs/blah automatically when user takes a picture
</div>

<p>
Anvin would <a href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000596.html">rather see</a> some kind of web
application that accepts a photo of the QR code and decodes it on the server. For
one thing, having one (working) decoding code base is desirable: "<q>I can tell you just how bad a lot of the QR decoder software running on
smartphones are -- because I have tried them.</q>"  In addition, though,
a web application would also have the photo itself, so even if it didn't
decode because of picture quality or other reasons, those photos could be
used to improve the quality of the decoder. 
</p>

<p>
But that implies that a user would need to download an app to their phone
or use some web application as <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000603.html">suggested</a>
by John Hawley.  Garrett was <a href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000604.html">not in favor of either solution</a>, noting that
requiring an app makes its harder for users, while a web application
doesn't really make it any better:
<div class="BigQuote">
And now your workflow is "Take picture, move to browser, upload, wait to 
see if it decodes, back to camera, back to browser", etc. I know we're 
expected to be bad at UX here, but come on.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Given that many users already use photos to report crashes&mdash;taking a
picture of the screen with the last part of the backtrace&mdash;the QR code
mechanism, even if a bit cumbersome, might be able to provide the full
backtrace.  But, as Dave Jones <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000607.html">suggested</a>,
just having scrollback available on the console after a crash would make
much of the problem disappear:
"<q>What would be a thousand times more useful would be having working scrollback
when we panic, like we had circa 2.2</q>".


<p>
Users could then take a photo, scroll back a
ways, take another, and so on.  In the thread, there was widespread
agreement that console scrollback would be desirable.  But it turns out that the
advent of USB keyboards caused the loss of that feature.  Doing USB
handling inside the panic code would be <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000681.html">messy</a>,
so bringing that 
feature back is difficult.  Other ideas were mentioned, like providing
enough of the USB stack to write the crash information to a USB stick as
Anvin suggests, or
to "auto-scroll" the console output after a crash without requiring
keyboard input as <a 
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000683.html">proposed</a>
by Paul Gortmaker. 
</p>

<p>
Making it easier for users to report crashes with useful information was
one branch of the discussion, but the folks who work on the embedded side
are looking for more developer-oriented solutions as well.  Tony Luck <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000563.html">outlined</a>
the pstore back-ends that are currently available to store crash and other
information in various places (ERST, EFI variables, RAM) that are
accessible after a reboot.  Wang, Tim 
Bird, Jason Wessel, and others are interested in discussing that piece of
the puzzle.
</p>

<p>
While QR codes may seem like something of gimmick, they can compress a fair
amount of data into a form that can be digested elsewhere.  Getting useful
information out of an unresponsive, crashed Linux system is fairly
difficult at this point, so finding better ways to do so would be good.
Should the program committee decide to add this topic, a lively discussion
seems likely.  If not, though, enough people are looking
into the idea that something will emerge sooner or later.

<p>
I suppose I should resend blockconsole.  It has proven to catch the crash information, along with the entire kernel log, on a usb stick.  It is actually surprising how robust this is, in spite of the large amount of code it depends upon.<br>

Only block, no filesystem.  And so far it has had a perfect track record in our environment.  A rather nice surprise, as you definitely were not the only one. ;)<br>

I thought kdump was the modern solution for getting crash information. Maybe we should be encouraging distributions to make a simple "save details to disk" initrd and loading it into the kdump area by default?<br>

kdump means sacrificing ~128MB of RAM at all times in order to have somewhere to put the kdump kernel, and reliability on consumer hardware is less than stellar. It's a hard problem.<br>

         <blockquote> kdump means sacrificing ~128MB of RAM at all times in order to have

    is less than stellar. It's a hard problem.</blockquote>

<p>How about keeping a static piece of code in the kernel that can
be executed in real mode to use BIOS to reset display to 25x80
(or whatever it was) and just loop circularly over pages of dump info,
outputting it in the most primitive way, with just hit-any-key as page
advance? IWT this shouldn't take up more than a few KB, never mind MB.

<p>Last gasp would be to transfer to this code.

<p>Maybe you could use box characters to generate QR codes, 3 per screen,
at 25x25 or 21x21, but that would be more code.

Once you step out of "real mode" (i.e., 16-bit DOS mode) into "protected mode" (32-bit or 64-bit, multiple memory permission rings, all that jazz), you no longer have access to the BIOS or its interrupts, so you can't ask it for help with peripherals anymore.<br>
<p>
Before then, the BIOS will give you keyboard access, tell you what drives are installed and what size they are, let you write to the screen, all sorts of wonderful stuff. For example, you can write "Hello world!" in assembler for an x86 PC, using only a couple dozen opcodes, which is very exciting when you're first learning about such a low level.<br>
<p>
If UEFI really means the loss of all that, it makes me kinda sad.<br>

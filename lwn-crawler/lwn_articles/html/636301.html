Jérôme Glisse started an LSFMM 2015 memory-management track session on
heterogeneous memory management (HMM) by noting that memory bandwidth for CPUs
has increased slowly in recent years.  There is little motivation for
faster progress, since not many workloads sustain maximum memory bandwidth;
instead, CPU access patterns are relatively random, and latency is usually
the determining factor in the performance of any given workload.
<p>
When one looks at graphical processing units (GPUs), the story is a bit
different.  Contemporary GPUs are designed for good performance with up to
10,000 running threads; to get there, they can have a maximum memory
bandwidth that exceeds CPU-memory bandwidth by a factor of ten.  Even so, a
good GPU can saturate that bandwidth.  GPUs, in other words, can do some
things extremely quickly.
<p>
Increasingly, Jérôme said, we are seeing systems where the CPU and the GPU
are placed on the same die, both with access to the same memory.  The GPU
is useful for "light" gaming, user-interface rendering, and more.  On such
systems, most of the memory bandwidth is used by the GPU.
<p>
The HMM code exists to allow the CPU and GPU to share the same memory and
the same address space; it could eventually be useful for other devices
with access to memory as well.  The GPU gains software capabilities similar
to those the CPU has; it runs its own page table, can incur page faults,
and more.  The key is to provide a way to manage the ownership of a given

block of memory to avoid race conditions.  And that is what HMM does; it
provides a way to "migrate" memory between the CPU and the GPU, with only
one side having access at any given time.  If, say, the CPU attempts to
access memory that currently belongs to the GPU, it will incur a page
fault.  The fault-handling code can then migrate the memory back and allow
the CPU's work to proceed.
<p>
Implementing this functionality requires the ability to keep page tables
synchronized on both sides; that is done on the CPU side through the use of
a memory-management unit (MMU) notifier callback.  Whenever the status of a
block of memory changes, the appropriate page-table invalidations can be
done.  There is one catch, though: to work properly, the notifier needs to
be able to sleep, which is not something that MMU notifiers are currently
allowed to do.  That has been a sticking point for the acceptance of this
patch so far.
<p>
Andrew Morton jumped in to express some concerns about the generality of
this system.  GPUs are changing rapidly, he said; we could easily reach a
point where, five years from now, nobody is using the HMM code anymore, but
it still must be maintained.  Jérôme responded that he believes the system
is sufficiently general to be useful for GPUs, digital signal processors,
and other devices for a long time.
<p>
Jérôme finished up by saying that HMM support is needed in order to provide
full, transparent GPU support to applications.  The compiler projects are
working on the ability to vectorize loops for execution on the GPU;
when this works, 
applications will be able to use the GPU without even knowing about it.
<p>
Rik van Riel asked if the group had any issues with the HMM code that
needed discussion.  Mel Gorman asked how many people had actually read the
patch set; it turned out that not many had.  Rik had reviewed an older
version and didn't find any real issues with it.  Andrew noted that there
have not been a whole lot of reviews of the HMM code in general, and there
do not appear to be many other users waiting in the wings.
<p>
The session finished with some scattered discussion of various HMM
details.  How is the migration of anonymous pages to a device handled?  The
answer is that the device looks like a special type of swap file.  The
trick here is in handling of <tt>fork()</tt>; in this case, all of the
relevant memory must be migrated back to the CPU first.  Atomic access by
the device is handled by mapping the relevant page(s) as read-only on the
CPU; subsequent write faults look a lot like copy-on-write faults.  It
would be nice to be able to handle file-backed pages in the HMM system;
that would require the creation of a special entry type in the page cache.
That brings up a problem similar to the MMU-notifier issue: the filesystem
code assumes that page-cache lookups are atomic, but, in this case, the
code will need to sleep.  It is not clear how to handle that one; adding
HMM-specific code to each filesystem was mentioned, but that does not
appear to be an appealing option.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 15, 2015</br>
           </div>
Persistent memory (or non-volatile memory) has a number of nice features:
it doesn't lose its contents when power is cycled, it is fast, and it is
expected to be available in large quantities.  Enabling proper support for
this memory in the kernel has been a topic of discussion and development for
some years; it was, predictably, an important topic at this year's <a
href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory
Management Summit</a>.  The 4.1 kernel will contain a new driver intended
to improve support for persistent memory, but there is still a fair amount
of work to be done.
<p>
At a first glance, persistent memory looks like normal RAM to the
processor, so it might be tempting to simply use it that way.  There are,
though, some good reasons for not doing that.  The performance
characteristics of persistent memory are still not quite the same as RAM;
in particular, write operations can be slower.  Persistent memory may
not wear out as quickly as older flash arrays did, but it is still 
best to avoid rewriting it many times per second, as could happen if it
were used as regular memory.  And the persistence of persistent memory is a
valuable feature to take advantage of in its own right — but, to do so, the
relevant software must know which memory ranges in the system are
persistent.  So persistent memory needs to be treated a bit differently.
<p>
The usual approach, at least for a first step, is to separate persistent
memory from normal RAM and treat it as if it were a block device.  Various
drivers implementing this type of access have been circulating for a while
now.  It appears that <a href="/Articles/640114/">this driver from Ross
Zwisler</a> will be merged for the 4.1 release.  It makes useful reading
as it is something close to the simplest possible example of a
working block device driver.  It takes a region of memory, registers a
block device to represent that memory, and implements block read and write
operations with <tt>memcpy()</tt> calls.
<p>
In <a href="/Articles/640115/">his pull request</a> to merge this driver,
Ingo Molnar noted that a number of features that one might expect,
including <tt>mmap()</tt> and execute-in-place, are not supported yet, and
that persistent-memory contents would be copied in the page cache.  What
Ingo had missed is that the <a href="/Articles/610174/">DAX patch set</a>
providing direct filesystem access to persistent memory was merged for the 4.0
release.  If a DAX-supporting filesystem (ext4 now, XFS soon) is built in a
persistent memory region, file I/O will avoid the page cache and operations
like <tt>mmap()</tt> will be properly supported.
<p>
That said, there are a few things that still will not work quite as
expected.  One of those is <tt>mlock()</tt>, which, as Yigal Korman <a
href="/Articles/640118/">pointed out</a>, may seem a bit strange: data
stored in persistent memory is almost by definition locked in memory.  As
<a href="/Articles/640119/">noted</a> by Kirill Shutemov, though,
supporting <tt>mlock()</tt> is not a simple no-op; the required behavior
depends on how the memory mapping was set up in the first place.  Private
mappings still need copy-on-write semantics, for example.  A perhaps
weirder case is direct I/O: if a region of persistent memory is mapped into
a process's address space, the process cannot perform direct I/O between
that region and an ordinary file.  There may also be problems with direct
memory access (DMA) I/O operations, some network transfers, and the
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> system call, among others.
<p>
<h4>Whither struct page?</h4>
<p>
In almost all cases, the restrictions with persistent memory come down to
the lack of <tt>page</tt> structures for that memory.  A <tt>page</tt>
structure represents a page of physical memory in the system memory map; it
contains just about everything the kernel knows about that page and how it
is being used.  See <a href="/Articles/565097/">this article</a> for the
gory details of what can be found there.  These structures are used with many
internal kernel APIs that deal with memory.  Persistent memory, lacking
corresponding <tt>page</tt> structures, cannot be used with those APIs; as
a result, various things don't work with persistent memory.
<p>
Kernel developers have hesitated to add persistent memory to the system
memory map because persistent-memory arrays are expected to be large — in
the terabyte range.  With the usual 4KB page size, 1TB of persistent memory
would need 256&nbsp;million <tt>page</tt> structures which would occupy several
gigabytes of RAM.  And they do need to be stored in RAM, rather than in
the persistent memory itself; <tt>page</tt> structures can change
frequently, so storing them in memory that is subject to wear is not
advisable.  Rather than dedicate a large chunk of RAM to the tracking of
persistent memory, the development community has, so far, chosen to treat
that memory as a separate type of device.
<p>
At some point, though, a way to lift the limitations around persistent
memory will need to be found.  There appear to be two points of view on how
that might be done.  One says that <tt>page</tt> structures should never be
used with persistent memory.  The logical consequence of this view is that
the kernel interfaces that currently use <tt>page</tt> structures need to
be changed to use something else — page-frame numbers, for example — that
works with both RAM and persistent memory.  Dan Williams posted <a
href="/Articles/636968/">a patch removing <tt>struct page</tt> usage from
the block layer</a> in March.  It is not for the faint of heart: just over
100 files are touched to make this change.  That led to complaints from
some developers that getting rid of <tt>struct page</tt> usage in APIs
would involve a lot of high-risk code churn and remove a useful abstraction
while not necessarily providing a lot of benefit.
<p>
The alternative would be to bite the bullet and add <tt>struct page</tt>
entries for persistent memory regions.  Boaz Harrosh <a
href="/Articles/608538/">posted a patch to that end</a> in August 2014; it
works by treating persistent memory as a range of hot-pluggable memory and
allocating the memory-map entries at initialization time.  The patch is
relatively simple, but it does nothing to address the memory-consumption
issue.
<p>
In the long run, the solution may take the form of something like a
<tt>page</tt> structure that represents a larger chunk of memory.  One
obvious possibility is to make a version of <tt>struct page</tt> that
refers to a huge page; that has the advantage of using a
size that is understood by the processor's memory-management unit and would
integrate well with the transparent huge page mechanism.  An alternative
would be a variable-size extent structure as is used by more recent
filesystems.  Either way, the changes required would be huge, so this is
not something that is going to happen in the near future.
<p>
What will happen is that persistent memory devices will work on Linux as a
storage medium for
the major filesystems, providing good performance.  There will be some
rough edges with specific features that do not work, but most users are
unlikely to run into them.  With 4.1, the kernel will have a level of
support for persistent-memory devices to allow that hardware to be put to
good use, and to allow users to start figuring out what they actually want
to do with that much fast, persistent storage.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

wide-spread use of execute-in-place due to persistent memory (I imagine the entire /usr/bin would be placed in persistent memory) will make autoquit with socket activation more attractive.<br>

I agree. For execute-in-place I would expect only the code and constant segment to stay in persistent memory. The data segment (for each instance running )will be in ram paged, to allow copy on write (only pages actually written). The persistent memory can also bee paged (and bee marked as present).<br>
<p>
The logic (virtual) address of code-constant-segment can bee set to point to paged memory in the physical address of the persistent memory religion.<br>
<p>
With a 64 bit memory map you can have all store (persisten memory) in physical memory. You will only have to commit it when you open a file. (no move)<br>
<p>
I think this will give a big performance boost.<br>

It is very common to modify text pages -- think relocations. If you can't COW pages out of persistent memory, you can't realistically store binaries there (though PIC shared libraries and PIE binaries could be stored there, I think, though their PLT / GOT would have to be stored elsewhere, which is an... *interesting* change to ELF memory layouts and surely not an entirely compatible one: some programs will break).<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 17, 2015</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">LSFMM 2015</a>
</div>
One of the final sessions in the memory-management track of LSFMM 2015 had
to do with the intersection of persistent memory and huge pages.  Since
persistent memory looks set to come in huge sizes, using huge pages to deal
with it looks like a performance win on a number of levels.  But support
for huge pages on these devices is not yet in the kernel.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox started off by saying that he has posted <a
href="/Articles/615323/">a patch set</a> adding huge-page support to the
DAX subsystem.  But, he said, only one other developer reviewed the code.
The biggest complaint was the introduction of the <tt>pmd_special()</tt>
function, which tracks a "special" bit at the page middle directory (PMD)
level in the page table hierarchy, which is where huge pages are managed. 
<p>
Some background: the kernel allows architecture-level code to mark specific
pages as being "special" by providing a <tt>pte_special()</tt> function.
These pages have some characteristic that causes them to behave
differently than ordinary memory.
In cases where the architecture has enough bits available in its page table
entries, <tt>pte_special()</tt> just checks a bit there; otherwise things
get more complicated.  The core memory-management code treats so-marked
pages, well, specially; for example, virtual memory areas containing
"special" pages should also have a <tt>find_special_page()</tt> method to
get the associated <tt>struct page</tt>.
<p>
Back to the discussion: adding <tt>pmd_special()</tt> requires that the
"specialness" of the huge page be tracked at the PMD level.  It is not
clear that every architecture has a free bit available in the PMD to track
that state.  In theory, free bits should abound there since as many as 20
bits in the lower part of the entry are not needed to map to a page frame

<a href="/Articles/636975/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lsfmm/MatthewWilcox-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250

align="left"></a>

number, but some quick searching by developers in the room revealed that,
on x86 at least, the "extra" bits must be set to zero.  For now, though,
Matthew is using the same bit that <tt>pte_special()</tt> uses, so his
code should work on every architecture that supports <tt>pte_special()</tt>.
<p>
In the case of huge pages backed by persistent memory, the
<tt>pmd_special()</tt> bit indicates to the memory-management code that
there is no associated <tt>page</tt> structure.  Andrea Arcangeli asked why
a special bit was needed to mark that condition; Matthew responded that
it's because he doesn't really understand the memory-management subsystem,
so he implemented something he knew he could make work.
<p>
This code may eventually be pushed in a direction where
<tt>pmd_special()</tt> is no longer needed.  But there are some other
issues that come up.  Matthew raised one: what happens when an application
creates a <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> mapping of a file into memory, then writes
to a page in that mapping?  The write will cause the memory-management code
to allocate anonymous memory to replace the 2MB huge page being written to;
the question is: should it allocate and copy a full 2MB page, or just copy
the 4KB page that was actually written?  Andy Lutomirski suggested that the
answer had to be to copy 4KB; copying the full 2MB for each single-page
change would be too expensive.  But Kirill Shutemov replied that
copy-on-write for huge pages does a 2MB copy now; the behavior with
persistent memory, he said, should be consistent.
<p>
Matthew moved on to the topic of in-kernel uses for persistent
memory.  There will be some interesting ones, he thought, but how it should
all work has yet to be worked out.  HP, for example, is using
<tt>ioremap()</tt> to map persistent memory into the kernel as if it were
device memory; Matthew said that seems like the wrong approach to him.  We
should, he said, be using logical interfaces to persistent memory rather
than direct physical interfaces like <tt>ioremap()</tt>.  So he would like
to see the creation of some sort of mapping interface implemented within
the virtual filesystem layer that would allow persistent memory to be
mapped into the kernel's address space.
<p>
Andy said that the <a href="/Articles/434821/">pstore mechanism</a> could
benefit from directly-mapped persistent memory.  There was also talk of
maybe being able to load kernel modules from persistent memory without the
need to copy them into "regular" memory.  It might be possible to even map
the entire kernel, but there is one little catch: the kernel patches its
own code for a number of reasons, including use of optimal instructions for
the specific hardware in use and turning tracepoints on and off.  If the
kernel were mapped from persistent memory, that patching would change the
version stored in the device as well — probably not the desired result.
<p>
Finally, Matthew said, there have been requests for the ability to use
extra-huge, 1GB pages as well as 2MB pages.  He is looking at adding that
functionality, 
but he has been struck by the amount of code duplication that exists at
each of the four page table levels.  He has some thoughts about creating a
level-independent "virtual page table entry" abstraction that could be used
to get rid of much of that duplication.  The reaction from the assembled
memory-management developers was cautiously positive; Matthew was
encouraged to implement this abstraction within the DAX code.  If it works
out well there, it can then spread into the rest of the memory-management
code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

why not?<br>
<p>
If the kernel can apply the appropriate patches for a different hardware etc it shouldn't matter which form is on the persistent media (In addition, how much are these things going to migrate from one system to another?)<br>
<p>
For things like tracepoint, I can see value in having them persist across a reboot. I should be a boot time flag to disable all tracepoints.<br>
<p>
Yes, it will require a little bit of change, but it doesn't seem like a huge amount of work, and there is value in letting thing persist.<br>

The problem with leaving a kernel image patched is that the code that runs up to the patching function is often patched as well. So the kernel assumes that the bootup image is 'unpatched', with generic instructions in it that will work on all CPUs that are supported by that image.<br>
<p>
So if you patch it for a given specific CPU, and then migrate the device over to another system with an incompatible CPU, it might crash (or even corrupt data) before it has a chance to patch things.<br>
<p>
It's not an unsolvable problem, but has to be kept in mind as an extra complication.<br>

<p>
Is that a use case that anyone would actually expect to work? If so, is that a reasonable expectation?<br>
<p>
To me, that sounds a lot like doing a suspend to disk, removing the disk, putting it in another machine containing entirely different hardware, and expecting to somehow successfully resume from disk - and I presume nobody would expect *that* to work? It sounds like 'simply' being able to detect that this is something that's happened and saying 'no way' should be sufficient.<br>

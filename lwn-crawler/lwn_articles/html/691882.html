<p>We recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/689907/">explored the
&quot;sparse&quot; C parsing library</a> and saw that it made it easy to build
tools to inspect and report on the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a C
program.  Sparse provides functionality to simplify that AST so that
particular features of the code can stand out, but keeps the focus fairly
local.  In particular, it doesn't support any significant data-flow analysis
to detect how values change across a sequence of code. <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/w/smatch.git">Smatch</a> is a tool that has been
built on top of sparse and adds exactly that support, and more.
This extra analysis makes it possible to detect such things as
   conditions that will always (or never) be true, pointers that might
   be null, and locks that end up in different states depending on which
   path is taken through the code.  This can be very helpful for validating
   error paths and other rarely tested code.
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/690169/">recent announcement</a>
of the Core Infrastructure Initiative's "Best-Practices Badge," which
requires the use of static code analysis where possible, will hopefully
help focus people's thoughts on the value of adding such analysis to their
workflow; that should lead to a focus on the tools for static
analysis.  As C is a highly flexible language, it is likely that different
projects will use different patterns and styles and so be susceptible to
different sorts of bugs.  This flexibility suggests that a
one-size-fits-all static analyzer may not be the best solution.  We already
saw with sparse that it has functionality specifically tailored to check
patterns that are unique to the Linux kernel; there is no reason to
expect other projects won't have their own unique needs.  Smatch is already
prepared to handle this variability; to that end it implements the concept of
a current 
&quot;project&quot; that can be used to tune the analysis in various ways.
It has hard-coded knowledge of two projects: &quot;kernel&quot; and
&quot;wine&quot;.  Extending that list probably only requires interest to
be shown.</p>

<h4>Smatch: the big picture</h4>

<p>Smatch is a project that Dan Carpenter has been working on for about
13 years — though, for the first few years, it was based on GCC rather than
sparse.  It has always had a particular focus on looking for bugs in
the Linux kernel, so many of its tests are for patterns that have been seen
in the kernel and which often result in buggy or confusing code.  In a <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linuxkernel/entry/smatch_static_analysis_tool_overview">brief
introduction to the tool</a> posted last year he 
reported that about 3000 kernel bugs have been patched thanks to
warnings from Smatch.  Many were minor bugs in obscure corner cases,
but others had serious, real-world consequences.</p>

<p>Smatch is clearly a work-in-progress.  A common problem with
static-analysis tools is that of false positives: it is hard to report all
problematic code without also reporting some perfectly good and correct
code too.  To make that distinction, it is sometimes necessary to know what
the programmer was thinking and that level of abstraction is still beyond
the state of the art.  Consequently, Smatch needs a lot of heuristics to try
to guess what is intended, and some of those are more fully developed than
others.  Some of the code in Smatch doesn't seem particularly useful and
there is some code that isn't used at all.  Nonetheless, there is a great
deal of functionality that appears quite solid and useful; that is where
we will focus our attention.  If you need some project-specific static
analysis for your Best-Practices Badge, that would be the code to build
upon.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Smatch itself is built upon a foundation of sparse.  It
doesn't use all of sparse, omitting the &quot;tree simplification&quot;
stages completely and bypassing the normal calls to
<tt>evaluate_symbol()</tt>, using instead calls to
<tt>evaluate_expression()</tt> only when needed.  On top of this
foundation, it is possible to see three layers in the functionality provided
by Smatch.  The last layer contains various specific tests for particular
sorts of problems, and it is to this layer that any new test would be
added.  Understanding the layers beneath it will allow a new test to be
written with minimal fuss.</p>

<h4>Smatch: a code checking framework</h4>

<p>Where sparse is structured as a library, Smatch is structured as a
framework, though it also provides a library of support code.  Individual
checkers are written as plugins that the Smatch framework will call into as
needed.  These plugins can be independent or they can cooperate to build up
the state necessary to perform some particular test or match some general
pattern.  For example the <tt>check_user_data.c</tt> module keeps track of
when variables refer to user-space data, and exports a function
<tt>is_user_data()</tt> that other modules can use when performing
specific tests.  The plugin infrastructure does not support
dynamic loading of plugins, but adding a plugin to the C code can be
achieved by adding a single C file and a single line to another file to
register an initialization function to be called.  Adding support for
dynamic loading would only require a small amount of work.</p>

<p>There are two key mechanisms that a checker uses to interact with the
rest of Smatch: hooks and states.  Hooks are registered functions that are
called when particular features, such as pointer
dereferences or function calls, are found in the parse.  States are a means
for those hook 
functions to communicate from one place in the code to another.</p>
<p>Smatch maintains a set of states as it walks around the AST.  Each state
belongs to a particular checker and has a key and a value.  The key is
often the name of a variable or a field within a structure, but it can be
anything that has state, such as a particular signal that might have been
blocked or a capability in the kernel that might have been tested with
<tt>capable()</tt>.  The value can be as simple as a label like
&quot;non-null&quot; or &quot;unlocked&quot;, or can have an arbitrarily
complex structure, such as a list of possible values and probable values.
This state can be updated whenever a hook is called for an operation that
would change the relevant object or for an operation that tests the value
of the object.  The current state can be tested whenever it might be
relevant.</p>

<p>The most interesting handling of state happens with conditional code:
when the code flow can branch and then join. Smatch makes it easy to
record different states on different paths of an <tt>if</tt> statement (or
similar).  The <tt>CONDITION_HOOK</tt> hook is called when Smatch finds a
condition that affects the flow of code.  A function attached to this hook
can call <tt>set_true_false_states()</tt>, passing a variable name (or
other key) and two states, one that will describe the variable if the
condition evaluates true, and one for when it is false.  These two states,
which might for example be "is-null" and "non-null", will be used in the
two different code paths that follow the condition.  When an <tt>if</tt>
statement has a complex condition, such as
"<tt>(!foo&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;bar&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3)</tt>", Smatch drills
down as deeply as it can and just passes the leaf tests to the hook, so, in
this example, the <tt>CONDITION_HOOK</tt> will be called twice, once for
"<tt>foo</tt>" and once for "<tt>bar&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3</tt>"; Smatch will
make sure the right state ends up in the right code path.



<p>Merging states after a branching statement has completed is much more
interesting.  Smatch stores three different sorts of merges, each of which
could be useful in different contexts.  First, for each pair of states in
need of merging, Smatch will call the
<tt>merge_hook()</tt> function if the checker owning those states provides
one.  This hook must
create a new state that reflects the merge.  If no merge hook is available,
a pre-defined state called <tt>merged</tt> is used.  Second, Smatch
keeps a list of possible states for each checker and each key.  This list
always contains the main state unless that state is <tt>merged</tt>;
when two states are merged, the list of possible states is merged as well,
discarding duplicates. So if Smatch processed code like:</p>

<pre>
    switch(var) {
    	case 1: break;
    	case 2: break;
    	default: return
    }
</pre>

<p>then, after the <tt>switch</tt> statement, that list of possible
states for <tt>var</tt> would include the state after it had been
compared with &quot;1&quot; and the state after it had been compared with
&quot;2&quot;.  Checkers can then test if a particular state of interest is
in the list of possible states for a given key.</p>

<p>Finally Smatch keeps a more detailed history of which states were
present at each previous merge: a tree of states with &quot;left&quot; and
&quot;right&quot; branches reflecting the two inputs each at merge point.  This
history is used to effectively look back in time to a previous place in the
code when a variable was known to have a particular state.  The details of
how this works are fairly complex but the result is easy to
understand and powerful.  Using an <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/7a4fdad6e866cc5775322531813973e1f5c1d393:/smatch_implied.c#l17">example
from the comments in Smatch</a>:</p>

<pre>
    * Imagine we have this code:
    * foo = 1;
    * if (bar)
    *         foo = 99;
    * else
    *         frob();
    *                   //  &lt;-- point #1
    * if (foo == 99)    //  &lt;-- point #2
    *         bar-&gt;baz; //  &lt;-- point #3
</pre>

<p>At point #3, assuming that <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt> are
local variables that cannot be changed by <tt>frob()</tt>, we know
that <tt>bar</tt> is not null, as that is the only context in
which <tt>foo</tt> could be 99.  Very superficially, the code searches
for previous states of <tt>foo</tt> that don't conflict with the
current state, then assumes that the union of all the states that
<tt>bar</tt> could have had at those times can accurately describe
<tt>bar</tt> now. This is referred to in the code as an
<tt>implied</tt> value; many tests make use of this implied value
calculation.</p>

<p>The hooks that can be used to call functions to update or test these
states can roughly be divided into three groups: state-management hooks,
syntax-directed hooks, and derived hooks.</p>

<p>There are three state-management hooks, the merge hook (set with
<tt>add_merge_hook()</tt>) that we have already met, a
<tt>pre_merge()</tt> hook that is called a little earlier and allows
state to be prepared for easier merging, and an
<tt>unmatched_state()</tt> hook that can provide a default state.  The
implied value calculation finds it easier to always have an actual state so
it doesn't need to deal with non-existent state; when necessary it
requests the default value.</p>

<p>There are 35 <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/7a4fdad6e866cc5775322531813973e1f5c1d393:/smatch.h#l92">syntax-directed
hooks</a> that trigger on particular syntactic constructs.  As
well as <tt>CONDITION_HOOK</tt> mentioned earlier, there is
<tt>WHOLE_CONDITION_HOOK</tt> for
when you really need the whole condition rather than the parts, though no
current checker uses it.  There is also <tt>EXPR_HOOK</tt> for expressions,
<tt>STMT_HOOK</tt> for statements, <tt>ASSIGNMENT_HOOK</tt>,
<tt>RETURN_HOOK</tt>, and many more.</p>

<p>There is one extra hook that is syntax-based but quite different from
the others: <tt>add_scope_hook()</tt> adds a hook that will only be
called once, when the current scope completes.  Smatch comes with <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/7a4fdad6e866cc5775322531813973e1f5c1d393:/check_memory.c">a
checker</a> that uses the scope hook to ensure that memory allocated with
<tt>malloc()</tt> is either freed or stored somewhere before the
variable that holds the allocation goes out of scope.</p>

<p>Derived hooks are built on top of the syntax-directed hooks, so they
really belong in the next layer but it is convenient to introduce them
here.  There are currently two groups of derived hooks: function hooks and
modification hooks.  Function hooks trigger when a specific function is
called rather than just on any function call.  The above-mentioned
memory-allocation checker registers a function hook for each of the
standard 
memory-allocation functions (<tt>malloc()</tt>, <tt>calloc()</tt>,
<tt>realloc()</tt>, etc.), which is more convenient than registering a
<tt>FUNCTION_CALL_HOOK</tt> and then checking the function name.</p>
<p>The modification hooks attach to assignment, increment, and decrement
operators, as well as to function calls that pass the address of a variable.
Tracking all of these together allows all possible modifications to a
variable to be handled through a single interface.</p>

<h4>Smatch extra: tracking the values of variables</h4>

<p>The second layer of Smatch, built on top of the framework of checkers,
states, and hooks, is a collection of service providers.  These include the
derived hooks mentioned earlier and a few other useful features, but the
most substantial service in this layer is referred to as
<tt>SMATCH_EXTRA</tt>, which
attempts to track the value of every variable.</p>

<p>Each integer variable, including enums, and each pointer is potentially
tracked by this &quot;extra&quot; module with a state (sometimes referred
to as &quot;estate&quot; — extra state) that lists ranges of possible
values.  The estate also lists any other variables that are known to hold the same value,
either due to a recent assignment or a recent equality comparison.  For
pointers, some <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/5ff855790a51929cd233c9256c49dd810f23d3d2:/smatch.h#l482">arbitrary
ranges</a> are assigned to memory regions such as the stack, the heap, and
initialized data, so that they can be differentiated from each other and
from null pointers.  For integers, more precise numbers can often be
determined and 
used to, for example, check if an array reference might be out of
bounds.</p>

<p>Smatch can perform all the standard arithmetic and bit-wise operations
on signed and unsigned numbers to achieve constant folding similar to that
provided in sparse.  When it doesn't know the value of a variable, it
assumes the full range of possible values; after a comparison it can
narrow that range down.  When states are merged, it can merge
the lists of ranges that a variable might have so as to keep a best-possible
understanding of the current value.  This tracking of ranges is closely
tied in with the implied value calculations mentioned already, so
<tt>get_implied_value()</tt>, <tt>get_implied_max()</tt>, or
<tt>implied_not_equal()</tt> are the sorts of functions that are often
used to collect information about the current value of a given
variable.</p>

<h4>Smatch: so much more</h4>

<p>While this layered model should provide a reasonably good picture of the
overall approach of Smatch, it is a long way from the full story.  Around
the edges of this infrastructure are various other mechanisms for making
useful analysis such as:</p>

<ul>
<li> An interface to a database for storing and recalling various details
     of functions and global variables so that inter-file analysis is
     possible.</li>
<p>
<li> A record of the locations of all macro definitions so that code can
     be treated differently if it came from a macro expansion.</li>
<p>     
<li> A <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/tree/5ff855790a51929cd233c9256c49dd810f23d3d2:/smatch_scripts">collection
     of scripts</a> for post-processing output, for extracting reports from
     the inter-file database, and for making it easier to run Smatch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately the only way to know for sure what Smatch can do is to
examine the code and look at what the current 100 or so checkers actually
do.  Building on that shouldn't be too hard once you understand the overall
approach, and providing you know what patterns you actually want to check
for.</p>

<p>Smatch has already found a couple of bugs for me in a project I'm
working on, and I have an idea for an extra check that I would like it to
perform.  Now that I understand how Smatch works, it is nearly time to try
to build that test.  I'll let you know how it goes.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I am not sure that the "wine" project in Smatch works. I have been using the old gcc based Smatch successfully on Wine and Dan has been very kind to port some of the stuff I used over to the new Smatch. But for Wine the new Smatch suffered from two big problems:<br>
- Sparse couldn't compile Wine.<br>
- I'm not a compiler or even CS guy and sparse and the new Smatch were too steep for me to learn and fix.<br>
<p>
So I kept using the old Smatch for as long as it still run and was able to compile Wine. By that time coccinelle came along and I started using that. Coccinelle had the advantage of being useful also for my other Wine work aka massive automated code changes.<br>
Though not everything can be done with coccinelle and I always planned to go back and look at Smatch. Thanks for the article.<br>

I hadn't testing wine for some time.<br>
<p>
I have pushed an update so you don't need to do Neil's -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/ work around that he mentions in the other comment.  Also I changed it to ignore _Pragma() instead of dying.  There are still one or two files that don't compile because they use the tools/winegcc/winegcc wrapper instead of regular gcc and I didn't investigate how to deal with that.<br>
<p>
The main thing though was that it wasn't ignoring the ok() macro and the list of no return functions was out of date.  I also updated the smatch_scripts/ directory to take a -p=&lt;project&gt; argument.  The thing which I haven't managed to do yet is to make the cross function db work properly.<br>
<p>
    CHECK="~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch --file-output --full-path -p=wine" \<br>
        make CC="~/progs/smatch/devel/cgcc"<br>
    find -name \*.c.smatch -exec cat \{\} \; &gt; smatch_warns.txt<br>
<p>
You could pass a -j8 or whatever to the make to speed things up.<br>
<p>
The warnings are still pretty low quality compared to the kernel because I've massaged Smatch for the kernel's quirks.  :/  The kernel has a pretty uniform style so there are some issues I never noticed until now.<br>

Smatch is a bit hard to use. I recently spent few hours trying to generate symbol database and then to test out-of-the-tree repo but failed and gave up :(  I was wondering if the last paragraph indicates that the author was able to use sparse on a smaller and possibly out-of-tree body of code?<br>

It certainly does.  I placed the line<br>
<p>
  smatch -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/ $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt;<br>
<p>
in the appropriate place in my Makefile and it runs smatch and occasionally tells me that I assumed something might be NULL and then dereferenced that value, or that I'm calling malloc() with the wrong size.<br>
<p>
I didn't try generating a symbol database.  It still performs a number of tests without it.<br>

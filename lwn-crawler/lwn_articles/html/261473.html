<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 10, 2007</br>
           </div>
Syslets are a proposed mechanism which would allow any system call to be
invoked in an asynchronous manner; this technique promises a more
comprehensive and simpler asynchronous I/O mechanism and much more - once
all of the pesky little details can be worked out.  A while back, Zach
Brown let it be known that he had taken over the ongoing development of the
syslets patch set; things have been relatively quiet since then.  But Zach
has just returned with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/261325/">a new
syslets patch</a> which shows where this idea is going.
<p>
This version of the patch removes much of the functionality seen in
previous postings.  The ability to load simple programs into the kernel
for asynchronous execution is now gone, as is the "threadlet" mechanism for
asynchronous execution of user-space functions.  Instead, syslets have gone
back to their roots: a mechanism for running a single system call without
blocking. 
<p>

As had been foreshadowed in other discussions, syslets now use the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/259068/"><tt>indirect()</tt></a> system call
mechanism.  An application wanting to perform an asynchronous system call
fills in a <tt>syslet_args</tt> structure describing how the asynchronous
execution is to be handled; the application then calls <tt>indirect()</tt> to make it
happen.  If the system call can run without blocking, <tt>indirect()</tt>
simply returns with the final status.  If blocking is required, the kernel
will (as with previous versions of this patch) return to user space in a
separate process while the original process waits for things to complete.
Upon completion, the final status is stored in user-space memory and the
application is notified in an interesting way.
<p>

The <tt>syslet_args</tt> structure looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct syslet_args {
	u64 completion_ring_ptr;
	u64 caller_data;
	struct syslet_frame frame;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>completion_ring_pointer</tt> field contains a pointer to a circular
buffer stored in user space.  The head of the buffer is defined this way:
<p>
<pre>
    struct syslet_ring {
	u32 kernel_head;
	u32 user_tail;
	u32 elements;
	u32 wait_group;
	struct syslet_completion comp[0];
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>kernel_head</tt> is the index of the next completion ring entry
to be filled in by the kernel, and <tt>user_tail</tt> is the next entry to
be consumed by the application.  If the two are equal, the ring is empty.
The <tt>elements</tt> field says how many entries can be stored in the
ring; it must be a power of two.  The kernel uses <tt>wait_group</tt> as a
way of locating a wait queue internally when the application waits on
syslet completion; your editor suspects that this part of the API may not
survive into the final version.
<p>
Finally, the completion status values themselves live in the array of
<tt>syslet_completion</tt> structures, which look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct syslet_completion {
	u64 status;
	u64 caller_data;
    };
</pre>
<p>
When a syslet completes, the final return code is stored in
<tt>status</tt>, while the <tt>caller_data</tt> field is set with the value
provided in the field by the same name in the <tt>syslet_args</tt>
structure when the syslet was first started.
<p>
There is one field of <tt>syslet_args</tt> which has not been discussed
yet: <tt>frame</tt>.  The definition of this structure is
architecture-dependent; for the x86 architecture it is:
<p>
<pre>
    struct syslet_frame {
	u64 ip;
	u64 sp;
    };
</pre>
<p>
These values are used when the syslet completes.  After the kernel stores
the completion status in the ring buffer, it will call the function whose
address is stored in <tt>ip</tt>, using the stack pointer found in
<tt>sp</tt>.  This call serves as a sort of instant, asynchronous
notification to the application that the syslet is done.  It's worth noting
that this call is performed in the original process - the one in which the
syslet was executed - rather than in the new process used to return to user
space when the syslet blocked.  This function also has nothing to return
to, so, after doing its job, it should simply exit.
<p>
So, to review, here is how a user-space application will use syslets to
call a system call asynchronously:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The completion ring is established and initialized in user space.
<p>
<li> A stack is allocated for the notification function, and the
     <tt>syslet_args</tt> structure is filled in with the relevant
     information. 
<p>
<li> A call is made to <tt>indirect()</tt> to get the syslet going.
<p>
<li> If the system call of interest is able to complete without blocking,
     the return value is passed directly back to user space from
     <tt>indirect()</tt> and the call is complete.
<p>
<li> Otherwise, once the system call blocks, execution switches to a new
     process which returns to user space.  An <tt>ESYSLETPENDING</tt>
     error is returned in this case.
<p>
<li> Once the system call completes, the kernel stores the return value in
     the completion ring and calls the notification function in the
     original process.
</ul>
<p>
Should the application wish to stop and wait for any outstanding syslets to
complete, it can make use of a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int syslet_ring_wait(struct syslet_ring *ring, unsigned long user_idx);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>ring</tt> is the pointer to the completion ring, and
<tt>user_idx</tt> is the value of the <tt>user_tail</tt> index as seen by
the process.  Providing the tail as an argument to
<tt>syslet_ring_wait()</tt> prevents problems with race conditions which
might come about if a
syslet completes after the application has decided to wait.  This call will
return once there is at least one completion in the ring.
<p>
The real purpose of this set of patches is to try to nail down the
user-space API for syslets; it is clear that there is still some work to be
done.  For 
example, there is no way, currently, for an application to use
<tt>indirect()</tt> to simultaneously launch a syslet and (as was the
original purpose for <tt>indirect()</tt>) provide additional arguments to
the target system call.  In fact, the means for determining which of the
two is being done looks dangerously brittle.  As Zach has already noted,
the calling convention needs 
to be changed to make the syslet functionality and the addition of
arguments orthogonal.
<p>
There are a number of other questions which need to be answered - Zach has
supplied a few of them with the patch.  Interaction with <tt>ptrace()</tt>
is unclear, resource management issues abound, and so on.  Zach is clearly
looking for feedback on these issues:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who are trying
	to use syslets in their applications.  This will involve awkward
	wrappers instead of glibc calls for now, and your machine may
	explode, but hopefully the chance to influence the design of
	syslets would make it worth the effort.
</div>
<p>
So, the message is clear: anybody who is interested in how this interface
will look would be well advised to pay attention to it now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This new architecture seems to remove one of the key advantages of the previous syslet
interfaces: the ability to run many system calls without incurring system call overhead for
each one.

Also, because the completion function is called in the original 
process --- well, what do the old and new tasks share? If they share as 
little as POSIX processes, the completion function is going to have to 
resort to something nasty like a pipe read by the other process just to 
communicate with itself.

I think that's what the ugly syslet_ring_wait() is meant for.

I see a lot of unnecessary complexity, where should I drop my feedback, lkml or lwn? I'll mail

      In the current patch, the parent and child share virtually everything (VM, FS, files, etc) - i.e. the child task is essentially a thread, not an independent POSIX process.  I can hardly imagine why anyone would want to do anything else.<br>
<br>
Also, the more sophisticated functionality is not being abandoned, it is just being put off in the name of initial simplicity. The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/261325/">announcement</a> has the details.

So invoking a syslet may or may not result in the program continuing as a new process.  What
happens to child processes in this case?  If they stay attached to the syslet process, the
main program won't be able to check their exit status.

At least one experimental lisp had a "future"
function, which took a complete function call
and returned a function to call at some convenient
later time to get the results of the function.
In pseudo-c

void *later = future(function_to_run, (args_to_pass));

Future would start the function running 
asynchronously with code to catch its
results.

The caller to future would eventually call "later"
and if the results were already there, would return
with them.  If not, it would block until they
were available.

I found this elegant, and note that it separates
indirection and threadlet-ing.

That's rather similar to how Java-style threading is done in the case where the "master"
thread and the child task share no data. Presumably that's always the case in lisp, given its
functional design.

Sure, the Java approach is uglier and more verbose, but the principle remains practically the
same. You can use a callback or (with the TrollTech Qt approach) event in the event loop to
detect completion. Or you can just poll for completion by testing an instance variable of the
thread subclass.

A similar approach can be used in C++ with Qt. It's really rather nice, and makes threading
quite sane for launching independent deferred calls that should produce a result "later".

Handle blocking by continuing to run the userspace in a different process!

These guys are full of bright ideas. First cgcc, now this.
And then they say OSS has no innovation. We are talking about Creators, Inventors and
Innovators (TM) here. Not just some people stealing ideas.

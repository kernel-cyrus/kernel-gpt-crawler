</div>
<p>Hierarchies are everywhere.  Whether this is a deep property of the
universe or simply the result of the human thought process, we see
hierarchies wherever we look, from the URL bar that your browser
displays (<a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/14/05/03/007209/could-googles-test-of-hiding-complete-urls-in-chrome-become-a-standard">or maybe doesn't</a>) to the pecking order in the farm yard.
There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy">fun fact</a> that if you click on the first link in the main
text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeat that on each following
article, you eventually get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Philosophy</a>, though this is apparently
only true 94.52% of the time.  Nonetheless it suggests that all
knowledge can be arranged hierarchically underneath the general
heading of "Philosophy".</p>

<p>Control groups (cgroups) allow processes to be grouped hierarchically and the
specific details of this hierarchy are one area where cgroups have both
undergone change and received criticism.  In our <a
href="/Articles/604609/">ongoing effort</a> to 
understand cgroups enough to enjoy the debates that regularly spring
up, it is essential to have an appreciation of the different ways a
hierarchy can be used, so we can have some background against which to
measure the hierarchy in cgroups.</p>

<p>I find that an example from my past
raises some relevant issues that we can then see play out in some
more generally familiar filesystem hierarchies and that we can be
prepared to look for in cgroup hierarchies.</p>

<h4>Hierarchies in computer account privileges</h4>

<p>In a previous role as a system administrator for a modest-sized
computing department at a major Australian university, we had a need
for a scheme to impose various access controls on, and provide
resource allocations to, a wide variety of users: students, both
undergraduate and post-graduate, and staff, both academic and
professional.  Already it is clear that a hierarchy is
presenting itself, with room for further subdivisions between research
and course-work students, and between technical and clerical professional
staff.</p>

<p>Largely orthogonal to this hierarchy were divisions of the school into
research groups and support groups (I worked in the Computing Support
Group) together with a multitude of courses that were delivered, each
loosely associated with a particular program (Computer Engineering,
Software Engineering, etc.) at a particular year level.  Within each of
the different divisions and courses there could be staff in different
roles as well as students.
Some privileges best aligned with the role performed by the owner of
the account, so staff received a higher printing allowance than
students.  Others aligned with the affiliation of the account owner â€”
a particular printer might be reserved for employees in the School
Office who had physical access and used it for printing confidential
transcripts.  Similarly, students in some particular course had a
genuine need for a much higher budget of color printouts.</p>

<p>To manage all of this we ended up with two separate hierarchies that
were named
"Reason" (which included the various roles, since they were the reason a
computer 
account was given) and "Organisation" (identifying that part of the
school in which the role was active).  From these two we formed a
cross product such that for each role and for each affiliation there
was, at least potentially, a group of user accounts.  Each account
could exist in several of these groups, as both staff and students
could be involved in multiple courses, and some senior students might
be tutors for junior courses.  Various privileges and resources could
be allocated to individual roles and affiliations or intersections
thereof, and they would be inherited by any account in the combined
hierarchy.</p>

<h4>Manageable complexity</h4>

<p>Having a pair of interconnected hierarchies was certainly more complex
than the single hierarchy that I was hoping for, but it had one
particular advantage: it worked.  It was an arrangement that proved to
be very flexible and we never had any trouble deciding where to attach
any particular computer account.  The complexity was a small price to
play for the utility.</p>

<p>Further, the price was really quite small.  While creating the cross
product of two hierarchies by hand would have been error prone,
we didn't have to do that.  A fairly straightforward tool managed all
the complexity behind the scenes, creating and linking all the
intermediate tree nodes as required.  While working with the tree,
whether assigning permissions or resources or attaching people to various
roles or affiliations, we rarely needed to think about the internal
details and never risked getting them wrong.</p>

<p>This exercise left me with a deep suspicion of simple hierarchies.
They are often tempting, but just as often they are an over-simplification.  So the first lesson from this tale is that a little
complexity can be well worth the cost, particularly if it is well-chosen and can be supported by simple tools.</p>

<h4>Two types of hierarchy</h4>

<p>The second lesson from this exercise is that the two hierarchies
weren't just different in detail; they had quite different
characters.</p>

<p>The "Reason" hierarchy is what might be called a "classification"
hierarchy.  Every individual had their own unique role but it is
useful to group similar roles into classes and related classes into
super-classes.  A widely known hierarchy that has this same property
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification">Biological classification</a>, which is a
hierarchy of life forms with seven main ranks of Kingdom, Phylum,
Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.</p>

<p>With this sort of hierarchy all the members belong in the leaves.  In
the biological example, all life forms are members of some species.
We may not know (or be able to agree) which species a particular
individual belongs to, but to suggest that some individual is a member
of some Family, but not of any Genus or Species doesn't make sense.
It would be at best an interim step leading to a final classification.</p>

<p>The "Organisation" hierarchy has quite a different character.  The
different research groups did not really represent a classification of
research interests, but were a way to organize people into
conveniently sized groups to distribute management.  Certainly the
groups aligned with people's interests where possible, but it was not
unheard of for someone to be assigned to a group not because they
naturally belonged, but because it was most convenient.  To some
extent the grouping exists for some separate purpose and members are
placed in groups to meet that purpose.  This contrasts with a
"classification" where each "class" exists only to contain
its members.</p>

<p>An organizational hierarchy has another important property: it is
perfectly valid for internal nodes to contain individuals.  The Head
of School was the head of the whole school, and so belonged at the top
of the hierarchy.  Similarly, a program director could reasonably be
associated with the program as a whole without being specifically
associated with each of the courses in the program.
In many organizations, the leader or head of each group is a member of
the group one step up in the organizational hierarchy, which affirms
this pattern.</p>

<p>These two different types of hierarchy are quite common and often get
mingled together.  Two places that we can find them that will be
familiar to many readers are the "sysfs" filesystem in Linux, and the
source code tree for the Linux kernel.</p>

<h4>Devices in <code>/sys</code></h4>

<p>The "sysfs" filesystem (normally mounted at <code>/sys</code>) is certainly a
hierarchy â€” as that is how filesystems work.  While sysfs currently
contains a range of different objects including modules, firmware
information, and filesystem details, it was originally created for
devices and it is only the devices that will concern us here.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, three separate hierarchical arrangements of devices
that all fit inside sysfs, suggesting that each device should have
three parents.  As devices are represented as directories, this is
clearly not possible, since Unix directories may have only one parent.
This conundrum is resolved thorough the use of symbolic links (or
"symlinks") with implicit, rather than explicit, links to parents.  We
will start exploring with the hierarchies that are held together with
symlinks.</p>

<p>The hierarchy rooted at <code>/sys/dev</code> could be referred to as the "legacy
hierarchy".  From the early days of Unix there have been two sorts of
devices: block devices and character devices.  These are represented
by the various device-special-files that can normally be found in
<code>/dev</code>.  Each such file identifies as either a block device or a
character device and has a major device number indicating the general
class of device (e.g. serial port, parallel port, disk or tape drive) and a
minor number that indicates which particular device of that class is
the target.</p>

<p>This three-level hierarchy is exactly what we find under <code>/sys/dev</code>,
though a colon is used, rather than a slash, to separate the last two
levels.  So <code>/sys/dev/block/8:0</code> (block device with major number
8 and minor number 0) is a symbolic link to a
directory representing the device also
known as "<code>sda</code>".  If we start in that
  directory and want to find the path from <tt>/sys/dev</tt>, we can find the last two
  components ("<tt>8:0</tt>") by reading the "<tt>dev</tt>" file.  Determining that it is a
  block device is less straightforward, though the presence of a
  "<tt>bdi</tt>" (block device info)
  directory is a strong hint.

<p>
  This hierarchy is particularly useful if all you have is the name of a
  device file in <tt>/dev</tt>, or an open file descriptor on such a device.  The
  <tt>stat()</tt> or <tt>fstat()</tt> system calls will report the device type and the major
  and minor numbers, and these can trivially be converted to a path name in
  <tt>/sys/dev</tt>, which can lead to other useful information about the
  device.

<p>The second symlink-based hierarchy is probably the most generally
useful.  It is rooted at <code>/sys/class</code> and <code>/sys/bus</code>, suggesting that
there really should be another level in there to hold both of these.
There are <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt?v=3.15#L100">plans</a> to combine both of these into a new <code>/sys/subsystem</code>
tree, though as those plans are at least seven years old, I'm not
holding my breath.  One valuable aspect of these plans that is already
in place is that each device directory has a <tt>subsystem</tt> symlink that
points back to either the <code>class</code> or <code>bus</code> tree, so you can easily
find the parent of any device within this hierarchy.</p>

<p>The <code>/sys/class</code> hierarchy is quite simple, containing a number of
device classes each of which contains a number of specific devices
with links to the real device directory.  As such, it is conceptually
quite similar to the legacy hierarchy, just with names instead of
numbers.  The <code>/sys/bus</code> hierarchy is similar, though the devices
are collected into a separate <tt>devices</tt> subdirectory allowing each
<tt>bus</tt> directory to also contain <tt>drivers</tt> and other details.</p>

<p>The third hierarchy for organizing devices is a true directory-based
hierarchy that doesn't depend on symlinks.  It is found in
<code>/sys/devices</code> and has a structure that, in all honesty, is rather
hard to describe.</p>

<p>The overriding theme to the organization is that it follows the
physical connectedness of devices, so if a hard drive is accessed via
a USB port with the USB controller attached to a PCI bus, then the
path though the hierarchy to that hard drive will first find the PCI
bus, and then the USB port.  After the hard drive will be the "block"
device that provides access to the data on the drive, and then
possibly subordinate devices for partitions.</p>

<p>This is an arrangement that seems like a good idea until you realize
that some devices get control signals from one place (or maybe two if
there is a separate reset line) and power supply from another place,
so a simple hierarchy cannot really describe all the
interconnectedness.  This is an issue that was <a
href="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2014-May/000430.html">widely
discussed</a> in preparation for this year's
Kernel Summit.</p>

<p>When examining these hierarchies from the perspective of "classification"
versus "organization", some fairly clear patterns emerge.  The
<code>/sys/dev</code> hierarchy is a simple classification hierarchy, though
possibly overly simple as many devices (e.g. network interfaces) don't
appear there.  The <code>/sys/class</code> part of the subsystem hierarchy is
similarly a simple classification, though it is more complete.</p>

<p>The <code>/sys/bus</code> part of the subsystem hierarchy is also a simple
two-level classification, though the presence of extra information for
each bus type, such as the <code>drivers</code> directory, confuse this a
little. 
Devices in the <code>class</code> hierarchy are classified by what functionality
they provide (net, sound, watchdog, etc).  Devices in the <code>bus</code>
hierarchy are classified by how they are accessed and represent
different addressable units rather than different functional units.
The extra entries in the <code>/sys/bus</code> subtree allow some control over what
functionality (represented by a driver and realized as a class device)
is requested of each addressable unit.</p>

<p>With this understood, it is hierarchically a simple two-level
classification.</p>

<p>The <code>/sys/devices</code> hierarchy is indisputably an organizational
hierarchy.  It contains all the class devices and all the bus devices
in a rough analog of the physical organization of devices.  When
there is no physical device, or it is not currently represented on any
sort of bus, devices are organized into <code>/sys/devices/virtual</code>.</p>

<p>Here again we see that both a classification hierarchy and an
organization hierarchy for the same objects can be quite useful, each
in its own way.  There can be some complexity to working with both,
but if you follow the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt">rules</a>, it isn't too bad.</p>

<h4>The Linux kernel source tree</h4>

<p>For a significantly different perspective on hierarchies, we can look
at the Linux kernel source code tree, though many evolving source code
trees could provide similar examples.  This hierarchy is more about
organization than classification, though, as with the research groups
discussed earlier, there is generally an attempt to keep related things
together when convenient.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of the hierarchy that are worth highlighting, as
they illustrate choices that must be made â€” consciously or
unconsciously.</p>

<p>At the top level, there are directories for various major subsystems,
such as <tt>fs</tt> for filesystems (and also file servers like
<code>nfsd</code>), <tt>mm</tt> 
for memory management, <tt>sound</tt>, <tt>block</tt>,
<tt>crypto</tt>, etc.  These all 
seem like reasonable classifications.
And then there is <tt>kernel</tt>.  Given that all of Linux is an operating
system kernel, maybe this bit is the kernel of the kernel?</p>

<p>In reality, it is various distinct bits and pieces that don't really
belong to any particular subsystem, or they are subsystems that are
small enough to only need one or two files.  In some cases, like the
<tt>time</tt> and <tt>sched</tt> directories, they are subsystems which
were once 
small enough to belong in <tt>kernel</tt> and have grown large enough to
need their own directory, but not bold enough to escape from the
<tt>kernel</tt> umbrella.</p>

<p>The <tt>fs</tt> subtree has a similar set of files.  Most of <tt>fs</tt> is the
different filesystems and there are a few support modules that get
their own subdirectory, such as <tt>exportfs</tt>, which helps various file
servers, and <tt>dlm</tt>, which supports locking for cluster filesystems.
However, in <tt>fs</tt> is also an <em>ad hoc</em> collection of C files providing
services to filesystems, or implementing the higher-level system call
interfaces.  These are exactly like the code that appears in <tt>kernel</tt>
(and possibly <tt>lib</tt>) at the top level.  However, in <tt>fs</tt> there is no
subdirectory for miscellaneous things, it all just stays in the top
level of <tt>fs</tt>.</p>

<p>There is not necessarily a right answer as to whether everything
should be classified into its own leaf directory (following the
<tt>kernel</tt> model), or whether it is
acceptable to store source code in internal directories (as is done in <tt>fs</tt>).  However, it
is a choice that must be made, and is certainly something to hold an
opinion on when debating hierarchies in cgroups.</p>

<p>The kernel source tree also contains a different sort of
classification: scripts live in the <tt>scripts</tt> directory, firmware
lives in the <tt>firmware</tt> directory, and header files live in the
<tt>include</tt> directory â€” except when they don't. There has been a
tendency in recent years to move some header files 
out of the <tt>include</tt> directory tree and closer to the C source code
files that they are related to.  To make this more concrete, let's
consider the example of the NFS and the ext3 filesystems.</p>

<p>Each of these filesystems consist of some C language files, some C
header files, and assorted other files.  The question is: should the
header files for NFS live with the header files for ext3 (header files
together), or should the header files for NFS live with the C language
files for NFS (NFS files together)?  To put this another way, do we
need to use the hierarchy to classify the header files as different
from the other files, or are the different names sufficient?</p>

<p>There was a time when most, if not all, header files were in the
<code>include</code> tree.  Today, it is very common to find include files mixed
with the C files.  For ext3, a <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4613ad180d19082f99551477dcb13cb23d23661b">big
change</a> happened in Linux 3.4, when all
four header files were moved from <code>include/linux/</code> into a single
file with the rest of the ext3 code: <code>fs/ext3/ext3.h</code>.</p>

<p>The point here is that classification is quite possible without using
a hierarchy. Sometimes hierarchical classification is perfect for the
task.  Sometimes it is just a cumbersome inconvenience.  Being willing
to use hierarchy when, but only when, it is needed, makes a lot of
sense.</p>

<h4>Hierarchies for processes</h4>

<p>Understanding cgroups, which is the real goal of this series of
articles, will require some understanding of how to manage groups of
processes and what role hierarchy can play in that management.  None
of the above is specifically about processes, but it does raise some
useful questions or issues that we can consider when we start looking
at the details of cgroups:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li>
Does the simplicity of a single hierarchy outweigh the
  expressiveness of multiple hierarchies, whether they are separate (as in
  sysfs) or interconnected (as in the account management example)?</p>
</li>

<li>
Is the overriding goal to classify processes, or simply to organize
  them?  Or are both needs relevant, and, if so, how can we combine
  them?</p>
</li>

<li>
Could we allow non-hierarchical mechanisms, such as symbolic links
  or file name suffixes, to provide some elements of classification or
  organization?</p>
</li>

<li>
Does it ever make sense for processes to be attached to internal
  nodes in the hierarchy, or should they be forced into leaves, even
  if that leaf is simply a <code>miscellaneous</code> leaf.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>In the hierarchy of process groups we looked at  <a href="/Articles/603762/">last time</a>, we saw a
single simple hierarchy that classified processes, first by login
session, and then by job group.  All processes that were in the
hierarchy at all were in the leaves, but many processes, typically
system daemons that never opened a tty at all, were completely
absent from the hierarchy.</p>

<p>To begin to find answers to these questions in a more modern setting,
we need to understand what cgroups actually does with processes and
what the groups are used for.  In the next article we will start
answering that question by taking a close look at some of the cgroups
"subsystems", which include
   resource controllers and various other operations that need to treat a
   set of processes as group.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

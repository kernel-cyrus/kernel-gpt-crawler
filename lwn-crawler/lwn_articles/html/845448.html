           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 11, 2021</br>
           </div>
Given the large set of system calls implemented by the Linux kernel, it
would not be surprising for most people to be unfamiliar  with a few of
them.  Not everybody needs to know the details of
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresuid.2.html"><tt>setresgid()</tt></a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/modify_ldt.2.html"><tt>modify_ldt()</tt></a>,
or
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lookup_dcookie.2.html"><tt>lookup_dcookie()</tt></a>,
after all.  But even developers who have a wide understanding of the Linux
system-call set may be surprised by <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kcmp.2.html"><tt>kcmp()</tt></a>,
which is not enabled by default in the kernel build.  It would seem,
though, that the word has gotten out, leading to an effort to make
<tt>kcmp()</tt> more widely available.
<p>
The <tt>kcmp()</tt> system call was <a href="/Articles/478111/">added in
2012</a> to address a problem encountered by the <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">checkpoint/restore in user space</a>
(CRIU) effort.  The CRIU developers are working (with some success) toward
the goal of being able to record the complete state of a set of processes
to persistent storage, then restart those processes at some future time,
possibly on a different machine.  This would be challenging in the best of
times, but the CRIU developers have taken on an additional handicap: doing
the entire job from user space.  Over the years attempts have been made to
implement a kernel-based checkpoint mechanism, but none have even come
close to being considered for merging.  The user-space approach appears to
be the only realistic way of solving the checkpoint/restore problem.
<p>
CRIU may be banished to user space, but the kernel community has still
allowed the addition of features where needed to get the job done.  For
example, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
helps in the migration of process memory, and various features of the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
system call help with recreating processes that look the same as they did
at checkpoint time.  These helpers have made the checkpoint/restore job
doable while still keeping most of the work out of the kernel.
<p>
One problem the CRIU developers encountered early on was determining
whether two open file descriptors (possibly found in different processes)
refer to the same open file within the kernel.  Creating such file
descriptors can be done with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html"><tt>dup()</tt></a>
or <tt>clone()</tt>; they can be spread across unrelated processes by
sending <tt>SCM_RIGHTS</tt> datagrams.  It was easy enough for CRIU to
determine that two file descriptors refer to the same file by looking at
the relevant entries in <tt>/proc</tt>; at restore time, that file can be
opened again in both places to recreate the situation at checkpoint time.

</blockquote>
<p>
If, however, two file descriptors refer to the same <i>open</i> file — if,
in other words, they refer to the same <tt>file</tt> structure within the
kernel — then replacing them with two independent descriptors at restore
time may break the application.  CRIU can do the right thing to restore
these descriptors correctly, but only if it can detect that they are
related at checkpoint time.  That detection was not something that the
kernel supported at the time.
<p>
Querying the provenance of file descriptors is, at its core, asking about
the kernel's internal data structures; making that information available
must be done with great care.  One idea that was discussed early on was to
have the kernel export the address of the <tt>file</tt> structure behind
each descriptor; if two descriptors show the same address, then they are
entangled and should be recreated in the same mode.  But the kernel goes to
some length to hide the addresses of its data structures to make attacks
harder; this effort is not always successful, but it is deemed worth
doing.  So exposing addresses in this way is not something that will fly.
<p>
Instead, the developers finally added a system call to answer the actual
question: are these two descriptors the same?  That was <tt>kcmp()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int kcmp(pid_t pid1, pid_t pid2, int type, unsigned long idx1,
    	     unsigned long idx2);
</pre>
<P>
If <tt>type</tt> is <tt>KCMP_FILE</tt>, then the kernel will check whether
file descriptor <tt>idx1</tt> in the process whose ID is <tt>pid1</tt> is
the same as descriptor <tt>idx2</tt> in <tt>pid2</tt>.  There are a number
of other resources that can be queried in the same way, but the question is
always the same: are these two the same thing?  This is a much safer
question for the kernel to answer, but there are still restrictions; in
particular, the calling process must have the privilege to use <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>
on both of the target processes, and all processes involved must be in the
same PID namespace.
<p>
Even with those restrictions, <tt>kcmp()</tt> made some people nervous.  As
a way of containing any possible damage, this system call was only built
into kernels configured for checkpoint/restore functionality.  If it was
absent on most kernels, it could not be used to exploit those kernels,
after all.
<p>
In the real world, though, the choices made by kernel developers about
configuration options mean relatively little.  Most users run kernels built
by distributors, and distributors have an incentive to enable as many
features as possible, even if relatively few users will need them.  Most
people will not complain about unneeded code in their kernels — code they
probably do not even know is there — but they will definitely complain if
some feature they need does not work.  So, while checkpoint/restore users
are relatively rare, distributors (Fedora and Ubuntu, for example) have
enabled the feature for those who need it.  That has made <tt>kcmp()</tt>
widely available as well.
<p>
If you make a feature available, somebody will come along and use it,
probably in some way you didn't anticipate.  And so, it seems, the <a
href="https://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa graphics library</a> found a use for
<tt>kcmp()</tt> that has nothing to do with checkpointing.  At times, the
library can find itself dealing with multiple file descriptors referring to
the same underlying DRM devices; in this case, making changes to one will
affect the other, probably in unsatisfying ways.  To avoid this problem,
Mesa checks (with <tt>kcmp()</tt>) to ensure that file descriptors are
independent when needed. 
<p>
That check will only work properly if <tt>kcmp()</tt> is actually
available in the running kernel, though, and that is not the case on  all
distributions.  Asking those distributors to enable the full checkpoint/restore
functionality for <tt>kcmp()</tt> seems like overkill, so Chris Wilson
instead <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210205163752.11932-1-chris@chris-wilson.co.uk/">submitted
a patch</a> to make <tt>kcmp()</tt> selectable independently.  Describing
the need for the patch, Daniel Vetter <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKMK7uHnOA9CuRxcKkcqG8duOw_3dZobkThcV7Q_swMXVoLCkQ@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It was maybe stupid, but our userspace started relying on fd
	comparison through sys_kcomp. So for better or worse, if you want
	to run the mesa3d gl/vk stacks, you need this. Was maybe not the
	brightest idea, but since enough distros had this enabled by
	defaults, it wasn't really discovered, and now we're shipping this
	everywhere.
</div>
<p>
Michel Dänzer, who implemented this functionality, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5a940e13-8996-e9e5-251e-a9af294a39ff@daenzer.net/">defended</a>
the use of <tt>kcmp()</tt> and expressed surprise that it wasn't
universally available.  He asked what other solution he should have chosen,
but got no answer.  Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202102051030.1AF01772D@keescook/">noted</a> that
<tt>kcmp()</tt> "<q>is a really powerful syscall</q>", but that its
use is constrained and it's already widely available, "<q>so it may be
okay to expose this</q>".
<p>
The first version of the patch enabled <tt>kcmp()</tt> by default, but that
runs counter to normal practice even in the absence of any residual
security concerns so, by the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210205220012.1983-1-chris@chris-wilson.co.uk/">third
version</a>, the default was changed to "no".  The system call will still
be enabled, though, if either checkpoint/restore or graphics are enabled,
meaning that it will be available on most kernels going forward.  It would
be fairly surprising if this patch were not merged for 5.12, and
distributors may well backport it to older kernels as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I was wondering why people sounded so scared of this syscall, so I looked it up:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kcmp.2.html">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kcmp.2.html</a><br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       The return value of a successful call to kcmp() is simply the</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       result of arithmetic comparison of kernel pointers (when the</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       kernel compares resources, it uses their memory addresses).</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       The easiest way to explain is to consider an example.  Suppose</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       that v1 and v2 are the addresses of appropriate resources, then</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       the return value is one of the following:</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;           0   v1 is equal to v2; in other words, the two processes</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;               share the resource.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;           1   v1 is less than v2.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;           2   v1 is greater than v2.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;           3   v1 is not equal to v2, but ordering information is</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;               unavailable.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       kcmp() was designed to return values suitable for sorting.  This</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       is particularly handy if one needs to compare a large number of</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;       file descriptors.</font><br>
<p>
In other words, it does not just test for equality, it establishes an ordering (to help reduce the number of kcmp calls). It&#x27;s easy to see how gaining information about the layout of kernel objects is useful to attackers.<br>
<p>
&quot;Pointer obfuscation&quot; is mentioned so I assume the values which are compared are no longer actual pointer values. Does anyone have more information on this?<br>

I suppose the kernel could have a random mask (generated at boot) that it XORs with each pointer before comparison. That should preserve *an* order, but not the actual in-memory layout order, no?<br>

kernel/kcmp.c says how it is done:<br>
<p>
The obfuscation is done in two steps. First we xor the kernel pointer with a random value, which puts pointer into a new position in a reordered space.  Secondly we multiply the xor production with a large odd random number to permute its bits even more (the odd multiplier guarantees that the product is unique ever after the high bits are truncated, since any odd number is relative prime to 2^n).<br>

FWIW, Mesa only needs KCMP_FILE, and doesn&#x27;t care about the difference between positive return values. All it needs to know is whether or not two file descriptors reference the same struct file in the kernel. That&#x27;s what &quot;this functionality&quot; refers to in my post.<br>
<p>
In a follow-up, I suggested another possible solution: Make KCMP_FILE available regardless of CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE, but restrict the rest of kcmp to that. But nobody seems to have picked up on it.<br>
<p>
P.S. Finally made it into a full-blown LWN article, guess I can retire or at least switch careers now. :)<br>

The extra return values are needed for scale if you have lots of FDs. With the extra return values the algorithm for comparing everything to everything else goes from O(n^2) to O(n log n). Given the obfuscation described above I don&#x27;t see a problem returning the extra info. I can see value in tools like lsof being able to tell if files are the same, and they need to work with lots of FDs.<br>

But you only need to perform a kcmp check if the two file descriptors refer to the same file. If they refer to different files, they cannot possibly be the same FD. Is there a situation where you have lots of FDs pointing to the *same* file?<br>

Checking which FDs belong to the same file will boil down to sort them (according to some criteria) and then compare them. Without some kind of sorting you will not end up with O(n*log(n)), but with pairwise testing, i.e. O(n^2). If kcmp() can provide an order (almost) for free, this is probably much cheaper than first constructing such an order in userspace and then using kcmp() only on those files that are the same.<br>

Isn&#x27;t it trivial to open a file multiple times?<br>

int fd1 = open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);<br>

More prosaically, in the case where you need to hibernate an entire container, lots of processes are likely to have certain files open at any given time:<br>
<p>
* Whatever systemd/sysvinit/put-your-favorite-alternative-here has attached to the average daemon&#x27;s stdin/stdout/stderr inside the container.<br>
* /dev/null, as you say.<br>
* /dev/urandom<br>
* Certain files in /etc<br>
* For forking servers, some kinds of sockets and/or pipes, including named fifos and Unix domain sockets.<br>
* Log files and other /var crap.<br>
* Probably half a dozen other things.<br>

Incidentally: &quot;/dev/null&quot; is probably one of the very few cases where userspace won&#x27;t actually care if it gets restored as the same file entry as another process or not.<br>

While true, one still needs to know that `/dev/null` is the backing file of a given fd to know whether to &quot;ignore&quot; it or not when restoring.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; determining whether two open file descriptors (possibly found in different processes) refer to the same open file within the kernel</font><br>
<p>
Oh, wow. That functionality is actually available! I&#x27;ve long been looking for how to compare open file descriptions. I&#x27;d need this for transactional programming in userspace; similar what the checkpoint/restore code does. With kcmp, a lot of ugly hacks can go away and the results should be much more accurate.<br>

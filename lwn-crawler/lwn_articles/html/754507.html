<p>
In a filesystem-track session at the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM), Ronnie Sahlberg talked about some changes
he has made to add support for compounding to the SMB/CIFS
implementation in Linux.  Compounding is a way to combine multiple
operations into a single request that can help reduce network round-trips.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/754535/">

</a>

<p>
He is trying to increase the performance of  the
kernel's SMB/CIFS client (which he called <tt>cifs.ko</tt>).  He started by
describing how compounding works 
in various versions of SMB.  Server Message Block (SMB)&nbsp;1 (also known
as Common Internet File System or CIFS) had no caching in the
clients, which meant that attributes needed to be retrieved from the server
each time they were needed.  If a <tt>stat()</tt> call was done, it would
do many round-trips to the server; if another was done 1ms later, it would
all be done again.
</p>

<p>
SMB&nbsp;2 added a mechanism to overcome this problem, but both
<tt>cifs.ko</tt> and the Microsoft server just implemented SMB&nbsp;1
behavior inside SMB&nbsp;2 packets.  Doing a <tt>statfs()</tt> in SMB using
<tt>cifs.ko</tt> today requires nine round-trips.  If the server is in a
different city, Sahlberg said, "you are not going to have a good time".
</p>

<p>
Microsoft has started using these new features to make SMB&nbsp;2 work
better.  If Linux did compounding, it could reduce the nine round-trips to
three.  Adding in the attribute caching that Steve French is working on
could drop the cost to one or even zero round-trips.  In reality, zero is
not achievable since there are some things that should not be cached, but a
reduction from nine to one is huge.
</p>

<p>
NFS versions 3 and 4 also have compounding support but, unlike SMB, there
is only one NFS header in a compound operation; SMB has a protocol header
per operation.  For SMB, each operation is attempted in order, regardless
if any of the earlier ones have failed.  For NFS, if an operation fails,
that ends the processing of the compound message.
</p>

<p>
Given those differences, Sahlberg wondered if there was a way to come up
with some common code that could be shared between the two.  Jeff Layton
said that he had tried something like that a long time ago, but it has totally
bit-rotted away. He said that  it is fairly hard to do code sharing in the
compounding 
support 
for the two protocols.
</p>

<p>
If you look at the network traces for NFS, you will see
compounded operations, French said.  There are barriers to how many
different operations can be collected up into a compound message, though,
because of the way they are handled by the VFS layer.  If a way were found
to combine more operations for NFS, perhaps that could be used for SMB as
well.  The macOS developers have done a lot of work to reduce the
round-trips by compounding six or seven operations in one message, French said.
But Layton suspected that was being done from user space, since the macOS
kernel and VFS are similar to Linux; it should have most of the same
constraints.
</p>

<p>
Sahlberg said that his intent was to try to do better and better with the
compounding over time so that we can "at least get to the point where
people will not 
laugh at us".  There is also a lot of technical debt "hanging around" with
the SMB&nbsp;1 protocol encapsulated into SMB&nbsp;2, which he is also
fixing.  He is targeting the 4.18 merge window for starting to get this work
upstream.  Layton said that it looks like a nice cleanup in some code that
is not all that easy to deal with.

This branch has the work that I did on this several years ago:<br>

<p>
The basic idea was to rework the sunrpc layer to handle SMB traffic as well as RPC.<br>
<p>
Trying to share code to do compounding is probably not going to be terribly fruitful as the encoding is not similar at all. The transport needs of SMB and NFS however are quite similar.<br>

The original kernel SMB code was developed before FUSE was in the kernel.  Does it still have an advantage over a FUSE SMB filesystem?  I still can't quite get used to the idea of an SMB client running in kernel space.<br>

Performance of the kernel SMB3 code in my testing was quite good, although in some cases Volker's userspace (Samba tool) smbclient improvements can beat it.   In most of my large i/o tests it was faster (Linux to Linux, on localhost) than NFSv3 or NFSv4.2.<br>
<p>
But ... SMB3 kernel client without compounding (and handle caching and directory leases) can be much slower for large directories and metadata searches.   This is very exciting work that Ronnie at Redhat is doing to introduce compounding into the kernel client (cifs.ko) for SMB3.<br>
<p>
In addition, Long Li's work (various "smbdirect" - ie network file system i/o over RDMA) is impressive.   Windows, NetApp etc. servers support RDMA and it is nice to be able to take advantage of this with very easy to use SMB3 mounts using the work Long Li has done.   He has a pending patchset as well for improving SMB3 direct i/o in the kernel.   Hard to imagine a userspace FUSE client able to keep up with that.<br>

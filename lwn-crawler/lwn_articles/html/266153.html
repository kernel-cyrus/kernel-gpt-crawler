<p>
Stuttering audio or an unresponsive desktop &ndash; typically caused by
operating system latency &ndash; are two things that annoy
users.  They can be difficult problems to diagnose, though, as they are
transient 
and buried deep inside the kernel.  A new tool, <a
href="http://www.latencytop.org/">LatencyTOP</a>, seeks to provide more
information on where latency is occurring so that it can be fixed or avoided.
</p>

<p>
Latency is the measure of how much time elapses between when an action is
initiated and when its effects become visible.  If a user clicks the mouse
button in an application, the latency is the amount of time between that
click and when the associated action begins.  There are lots of different
reasons for 
latency, some of which are outside of Linux's control; being able
to measure what latency the OS is contributing will be very useful.
LatencyTOP is reporting on a specific subset of latency causes, as described
in the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/265945/">announcement</a>:

<div class="BigQuote">
There are many types and causes of latency, and LatencyTOP [focuses on the]
type 
that causes audio skipping and desktop stutters. Specifically, LatencyTOP 
focuses on the cases where the applications want to run and execute useful 
code, but there's some resource that's not currently available (and the 
kernel then blocks the process). This is done both on a system level and 
on a per process level, so that you can see what's happening to the system, 
and which process is suffering and/or causing the delays.
</div>
</p>

<p>
LatencyTOP measures the average and maximum amount of latency in various
operations by inserting annotation calls in the kernel.  An example from
the announcement is instructive:
<pre>
     asmlinkage long sys_sync(void)
     {
    +       struct latency_entry reason;
    +       set_latency_reason("sync system call", &amp;reason);
            do_sync(1);
    +       restore_latency_reason(&amp;reason);
    +
            return 0;
     }
</pre>
The scheduler accumulates any time spent sleeping, between the
<tt>set_latency_reason()</tt> and <tt>restore_latency_reason()</tt> calls,
charging it to the "sync system call".  Any lower level calls to set the
latency reason will be ignored in this code path &ndash; they may be useful
in other code paths &ndash; as it is the highest level active reason that
gets charged.
</p>

<p>
The current interface for annotating is likely to change, though the
semantics will stay the same.  Comments on the
original submission suggested using the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/245671/">kernel markers</a> feature that was
merged for 2.6.24.  LatencyTOP developer Arjan van de Ven seems amenable to
that; reusing a kernel interface, rather than adding a new one, is
generally the right choice.  There is other work to do as well, the patch
was submitted for other kernel hackers to test and comment on, not to be
merged into the mainline.
</p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/266279/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/latencytop_sm.png" alt="[LatencyTOP
application]" border=0 width=119 height=125 hspace=3 align="right"></a>

<p>
LatencyTOP comes with a userspace application, shown at right, that
displays the information gathered.  It reads from the
<tt>/proc/latency_stats</tt> file that is created by the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/266246/">LatencyTOP infrastructure patch</a>
&ndash; so long as you enable CONFIG_LATENCYTOP in the kernel.  It displays
the nine &ndash; an off-by-one in the code as it would seem that ten
were intended &ndash; largest latencies over the past 30 seconds in the upper pane.
</p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/266291/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/latencytop2_sm.png" alt="[LatencyTOP
application]" border=0 width=119 height=125 hspace=3 align="left"></a>

<p>
A list of process names runs along the bottom of the display, which can be
selected with the arrow keys. The latency sources for
that process will then be shown in the lower pane.  The example at left
shows the tool with the
firefox process selected.  As can be seen, there are still lots of areas
that need annotations &ndash; "Unknown reason" along with the wait channel are
displayed when the reason has not been set.  When narrowing a problem down,
it should be straightforward for a kernel hacker to add annotations to the
appropriate locations.
</p>

<p> LatencyTOP, like its sibling <a
href="http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/">PowerTOP</a> &ndash;
also developed by van de Ven at the Intel Open Source Technology Center
&ndash; is a powerful tool for trying to track down system problems.  It
will probably undergo some changes along the way: the userspace
application is still rather rudimentary and the kernel data collection
needs finer-grained locking.  But, before too long, a mainstream tool
to measure system latency based on this work should appear.  </p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Btw, in the current version of the LatencyTOP patch, the annotations are all gone, they're no
longer needed.
(and, many aren't needed in the original patch, since most of the Unknown ones actually get
resolved in userspace even in the original, and adding a missing annotation even there was
just adding a line to the userspace program)

Would this patch also help diagnose latency in the case of audio capture, 
not just playback?

Because they seem to be related but different problems; playback latency 
is the time between a userspace process making a syscall to write audio 
and the kernel poking the audio hardware, capture latency the time between 
the audio hardware asserting an interrupt and the userspace process 
receiving the data. Or at least thats my educated guess, I Am Not A Kernel 
Hacker.

Today.. only a little... (eg it shows at least how long things take etc)

But the plan/hope is that the -rt latency tracer makes it to mainline at some point in the
future, which then really would help latencytop in giving the level of deep details needed for
this kind of analysis.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 25, 2015</br>
           </div>
One of the headline features in the upcoming 4.0 kernel is live patching —
the ability to apply a patch to a running kernel and fix a problem without
disrupting the operation of the system.  The truth of the matter, though,
is that the live-patching support merged for 4.0 is only the beginning of
the story; quite a bit more work will have to be done to have full support
for this feature in the kernel.  And now it seems that this work may take a
bit longer than the developers involved had hoped; indeed, one prominent
developer is calling for the entire concept to be rethought.
<p>
The code merged for 4.0 is a common core that is able to support patching
with both <a href="/Articles/597407/">kpatch</a> and <a
href="/Articles/596854/">kGraft</a>.  It provides an API that allows
patch-containing modules to be inserted into the kernel; it also allows the
listing and removal of patches if need be.  This API 
performs the low-level redirection needed to replace patched functions.
That is good as far as it goes, but it is missing an important component,
called the "consistency model," that ensures the safety of switching
between versions of a function in a running kernel.  If the change is
simple, it may be possible to safely make the change at any time.  More
complicated changes, though, may require that no kernel code is running in
any of the affected functions before the switch can be done.  
The consistency model
as found in kpatch and kGraft is where some of the biggest differences
between those two implementations lie, so some
work will clearly be needed to bring them together.
<p>
As originally developed, kpatch worked by calling <tt>stop_machine()</tt>
to bring the entire system to a halt.  It then would check the stack of
every process in the system to ensure that none are running within the
function(s) to be patched; if the affected functions are not currently
running, the patch can proceed, otherwise the operation fails.  KGraft,
instead, used a "two-universe" model where every process in the system is
switched from the old code to the new at a "safe" point.  The most common
safe point is exit from a system call; at that point, the process cannot be
running in any kernel code.
<p>
<h4>A unified consistency model</h4>
<p>
Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages; an attempt to
unite them would, hopefully, take the best from each.  And that is what
Josh Poimboeuf tried to do with his <a href="/Articles/632582/">consistency
model patch set</a> posted in early February.  This approach retains the
two-universe model from kGraft, but it uses the stack-trace checking from
kpatch to accelerate the task of switching processes to the new code.  In
theory, this technique increases the chances of successfully applying
patches while doing away with kpatch's disruptive <tt>stop_machine()</tt>
call and much of kGraft's higher code complexity.
<p>
The first objections to be raised focused on one particular aspect of the
consistency code: the stack check.  As Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/Articles/634653/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So far stack unwinding has basically been a best effort debug
	output kind of thing, you're wanting to make the integrity of the
	kernel depend on it.  You require an absolute 100% correctness of
	the stack unwinder -- where today it is; as stated above; a best
	effort debug output thing.  That is a _big_ change.
</div>
<p>
Ingo Molnar also <a href="/Articles/634654/">came out against</a> the use
of stack traces.  It comes down to the fact that getting a reliable stack
trace out of a process running in kernel space is not as easy as one might
expect.  There have been lots of bugs in that code in the past, and each
architecture brings its own set of special glitches to deal with.  And, as
Ingo pointed out:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	More importantly, there's no strong force that ensures we can rely
   	on stack backtraces: correcting bad stack traces depends on people
   	hitting those functions and situations that generate them, seeing a
   	bad stack trace, noticing that it's weird and correcting whatever
   	code or tooling quirk causes the stack entry to be incorrect.
</div>
<p>
What that means is that a bug in the traceback code is quite likely to stay
out of sight until some distributor issues a live patch, at which point
things will go badly wrong.  The idea of things going badly wrong and
disrupting a running system is just what users calling for live patching
are most wanting to avoid, so one can imagine that widespread unhappiness
would ensue.  But it is a risk that will always be hard to avoid, since the
correct functioning of the kernel does not otherwise depend on perfectly
accurate stack traces.
<p>
There are a number of approaches to consistency, and not all of them use
stack traces.  Given the opposition to that idea, it seems likely that
future proposals will omit that technique.  But that leaves open the
question of what <i>will</i> be used.  Ingo is <a
href="/Articles/634660/">pushing strongly</a> for an approach that forces
every process in the system into a quiescent, non-kernel state before
applying a patch.  It is arguably the simplest approach; it also puts
the kernel in a state where it is easy to know that applying the patch is a
safe thing to do.
<p>
But, as it turns out, the "simplest" approach still has a fair number of
tricky details.  Kernel threads cannot be pushed out of kernel space, so
some other solution must be found for them.  Processes that are blocked in
the kernel for some sort of long-term wait need to be unblocked, preferably
in a way that can be restarted transparently once the patching process is
complete.  That could require changes to the implementation of a lot of
system calls — and, perhaps, a lot of drivers as well.  Some ideas for
simplifying this task have circulated, but it would take a while to get an
implementation to the point where it would reliably succeed in patching a
running kernel.
<p>
An alternative would be to just go with the kGraft two-universe model,
which does not depend on stack traces.  The downside with this approach is
that the process of trapping every process in a safe place can take an
unbounded period of time during which the system is in a weird intermediate
state.  Yet another alternative is to do without the consistency model
entirely.  That would severely limit the range of patches that could be
applied, but it seems that most security fixes (involving, say, the
addition of a simple range check) could still be applied to a running
system.
<p>
<h4>Live kernel upgrades</h4>
<p>
Perhaps feeling that he had not stirred the anthill sufficiently, Ingo went
on to <a href="/Articles/634663/">propose</a> giving up on both kpatch and
kGraft, saying "<q>I think they are fundamentally misguided in both 
implementation and in design, which turns them into an (unwilling) extended
arm of the security theater</q>".  Rather than trying to patch a running
kernel, he suggested, why not just save the entire state of the system,
boot into an entirely new kernel, then restore the previous state on top of
the new kernel?  That would get rid of consistency models, greatly expand
the range of patches that can be applied, and, in theory, would be more
robust.
<p>
This idea is not new, of course.  The developers working on CRIU
(checkpoint-restore in user space) have had <a
href="http://criu.org/Usage_scenarios#Seamless_kernel_upgrade">seamless
kernel upgrades</a> in their list of use cases for a while, and they
evidently have it working for some workloads.  But making this
functionality work robustly on all systems would require a great deal of
extra work to snapshot the full system state (including the state of
devices) and restore it all under an arbitrarily different kernel.  Vojtech
Pavlik, one of the developers behind kGraft, <a
href="/Articles/634665/">estimated</a> that it would take ten years to make
such a system work.
<p>
The users asking for live patching, it is safe to say, would not be
thrilled about the prospect of waiting that long.  It is also far from
clear that the full-upgrade technique, once it actually works, can ever be fast
enough to keep those 
users happy.  Ingo estimated that a live upgrade could complete within ten
seconds, but that is an eternity to users who find even subsecond stalls
for patching to be overly disruptive.  So, while there is widespread
agreement that live upgrades are an interesting and possibly useful
technology, there is little chance that any of the developers currently
working on live patching will decide to refocus their efforts on live
upgrades.
<p>
So work on live patching will continue, but it is not clear what direction
that work will take.  The hopes of getting the consistency-model code ready
for the 4.1 merge window now seem somewhat remote; getting consensus on a
design that can be merged could take some time.  So, while it is still
possible that the kernel will have an essentially complete live-patching
feature by the end of the year, it may happen rather closer to the end of
the year than the developers involved might have hoped for.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It turns out I've spent a whole lot of time on backtracing, mostly on MIPS processors. And it is generally not even *possible* to do this in all cases. So, no, nothing that needs to be 100% reliable should be based on stack backtracing.<br>
<p>
I've also spent a lot of time working on hot swapping kernels. Ten years is probably about right as an estimate, which is why I'm not working on such a thing now. I think the Containers folks have the only really viable approach. However, tou don't want to take a huge performance hit all at once so you need an approach where you run two kernels and gradually migrate userspace processes and device drivers from one to the other. It's quite a project but I think it is theoretically doable.<br>

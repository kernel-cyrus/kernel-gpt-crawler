By the usual practice, the 3.19 merge window should have ended on
December&nbsp;21, two weeks after its opening.  But the solstice
celebration featuring 3.19-rc1
was not to be; Linus decided to <a href="/Articles/627181/">close the merge
window</a> one day early.  Among other things, his reasoning was that so
much work had come in that there wasn't a whole lot of point in waiting for
more:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Considering how much came in fairly late, I find it hard to care
	about anybody who had decided to cut it even closer than some
	people already did. That said, maybe there aren't any real
	stragglers - and judging by the size of rc1, there really can't
	have been much.
</div>
<p>
Indeed, this is a busy development cycle, with 11,408 changesets having
been pulled during the merge window.  That is more than was seen during the
entire 3.18 development cycle, where 11,379 changesets were merged before
the final release.
<p>
About 1000 changesets were pulled since <a href="/Articles/626150/">last
week's summary</a>; some of the more interesting, user-visible changes in
that set were:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The handling of the <tt>setgroups()</tt> system call in user
     namespaces has been changed in a way that could possibly break some
     applications; see <a href="/Articles/626665/">this article</a> for
     more information.
<p>
<li> The Ceph filesystem now supports inline data, improving performance
     for small files.  Ceph also supports message signing for
     authentication between clients and servers.
<p>
<li> KVM virtualization support for the Itanium (ia64) architecture has
     been removed. 
     It was not being maintained, and, seemingly, was not being used
     either.
<p>
<li> The InfiniBand layer has gained support for on-demand paging.  This
     feature allows an <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">RDMA</a>
     region to be set up and populated via page 
     faults when the memory is actually used, thus avoiding the need to pin
     down a bunch of memory that may never be needed.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Input</b>:
     	  Elan I2C/SMbus trackpads,
	  Goodix I2C touchscreens, and
	  Elan eKTH I2C touchscreens.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  Allwinner SoC-based NAND flash,
	  Broadcom BCM2835 pulse-width modulator (PWM) controllers, and
	  Atmel HLCDC PWM controllers.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Thermal</b>:
     	  Support for generic device cooling through clock frequency
     	  tweaking,
	  NVIDIA Tegra SOCTHERM thermal management systems, and
	  Rockchip thermal management systems.
     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The module removal code has been reworked to get rid of calls to the 
     much-maligned <tt>stop_machine()</tt> function.  In the process,
     module reference counting has been slowed slightly, but it is believed
     that nobody is tweaking reference counts often enough that the
     difference will be noticed.
<p>
<li> The <tt>CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME</tt> configuration symbol has finally been
     eliminated from the kernel; everything uses <tt>CONFIG_PM</tt> now.
<p>
<li> The <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>ASSIGN_ONCE()</tt> macros (described
     in <a href="/Articles/624126/">this article</a>) were merged in
     the final pull before the closing of the merge window.  These macros
     enforce the use of <strike>non-</strike> scalar types, hopefully avoiding experiences
     with tricky compiler bugs.
</ul>
<p>

If the usual schedule holds, the final 3.19 release can be expected
sometime around the middle of March.  Between now and then, though, a lot
of testing and fixing has to be done â€” 11,400 new changes will certainly
have brought a few bugs with them.  That said, the early indications are
that 3.19-rc1 is relatively stable for such an early release, so this may
yet turn out to be another fast cycle despite the volume of patches.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This isn't a spelling error, and I could be wrong, so I'll risk a transgression of the rules and post about it here:<br>
<p>
Doesn't READ_ONCE() enforce the use of / treatment as *scalar* types, rather than *non-scalar* types?<br>

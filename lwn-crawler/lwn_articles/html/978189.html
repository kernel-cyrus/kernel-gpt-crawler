           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 17, 2024</br>
           </div>
Software-interrupt handlers (also called "bottom halves") have a long
history in the Linux kernel; for much of that history, developers have
wished that they could go away.  One of their unfortunate characteristics
is that they can add unexpected latency to the execution of unrelated
processes; this problem is felt especially acutely in the
realtime-preemption community.  The solution adopted there has created
problems of its own, though; in response Sebastian Andrzej Siewior is <a
href="/ml/all/20240612170303.3896084-1-bigeasy@linutronix.de">proposing</a>
a new locking mechanism for realtime builds of the kernel that may have
benefits for non-realtime users as well.
<p>
In normal kernel builds, a software-interrupt handler will run, if needed,
at the earliest opportunity that the kernel finds; usually, that is
immediately after the completion of a hardware-interrupt handler or on
return from the kernel to user space.  Either way, software-interrupt
handling can delay the execution of a process that may have nothing to do
with the creation of that interrupt.  For most systems, that delay is not
usually a problem, but realtime kernels are all about response time; a
badly timed software-interrupt handler has the potential to cause a
realtime task to miss its deadline.
<p>
It turns out that the realtime developers are firmly of the opinion that
they have not worked on that project for over two decades just to be
thwarted by a software-interrupt handler.  So those handlers have been made
preemptible like nearly everything else in realtime kernels.  That change
only addresses part of the problem, though.  The kernel makes heavy use of
per-CPU variables as a way of avoiding contention between processors; as
long as no other CPU can access a memory location, there will be no
contention for it, and no need for locking to ensure mutual exclusion.
Except, of course, if a software-interrupt handler runs and tries to access
the same data.
<p>
To avoid such problems, kernel code can call <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt>,
which blocks the execution of software-interrupt handlers until
<tt>local_bh_enable()</tt> is called.  A call to
<tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> will also disable preemption and migration for
the running task, ensuring that it has sole access to the CPU during its
critical section.  That solves the problem of racing with
software-interrupt handlers (or any other kernel code) on the same CPU, but
creates another latency problem for realtime kernels; as long as preemption
is disabled, a higher-priority process cannot run on that CPU, once again
threatening to increase latency for that higher-priority process.
<p>
The solution to <i>that</i> problem in the realtime tree is to make tasks
preemptible while software-interrupt handlers are disabled.  But, since a
task may be depending on <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> to keep other tasks
from accessing its per-CPU data, <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> takes a per-CPU
lock on realtime kernels.  As a result, only one task can be running with
software interrupts disabled on any given CPU at a time.
<p>
But, it almost goes without saying, there is <i>another</i> problem.  If a
low-priority process enters a <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> section, it can
be preempted within that section and prevented from executing (and
restoring software interrupts) for a long time.  That could block a
higher-priority process from completing a <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> call
of its own.  It is, in other words, a classic priority-inversion situation.
Here, the problem is worsened by the fact that, in all likelihood, there is
no actual contention between the two tasks; they are probably calling
<tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> to protect entirely different data.
<p>
This situation highlights a problem with disabling software interrupt
handling: it is essentially a big lock that provides no indication of what
data it is actually protecting.  That, in turn, points to a potential
solution: replace the big lock with fine-grained locking that protects a
limited and well-defined set of data.  That is the approach taken by
Siewior's patch set.  Specifically, it adds a pair of new macros:
<p>
<pre>
    local_lock_nested_bh(local_lock_t *lock);
    local_unlock_nested_bh(local_lock_t *lock);
</pre>
<p>
Using this mechanism requires auditing each <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt>
section, figuring out which data is protected therein, and adding a <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/locking/locktypes.html#cpu-local-locks"><tt>local_lock_t</tt></a>
(a specialized lock that only prevents access from the same CPU) to that
data structure.  That lock can then be passed to
<tt>local_lock_nested_bh()</tt> to protect only that structure while not
blocking concurrent execution by unrelated code.

<p>
Code using this approach must still call <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> to
prevent access by software-interrupt handlers and to prevent migration to
another CPU.  But, once all of the <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> sections
have been audited and adjusted (a job that is reminiscent of <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#Big_kernel_lock">the long effort to remove the Big
Kernel Lock</a>), it will be possible to remove the lock that realtime
kernels take in <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt>, eliminating a significant
source of contention and latency.  Benchmark results posted with the patch
series show a significant improvement (14.5%) for a networking workload
once that lock is removed.
<p>
For non-realtime kernels, instead, <tt>local_lock_nested_bh()</tt> is
essentially a no-op, though it does provide information to the locking
checker for debugging purposes.  Local locks have no effect on non-realtime
kernels, and do not require any storage.  Thus, this patch satisfies one of
the rules that has constrained realtime development from the start:
realtime-specific features must not have a performance impact on
non-realtime kernels.
<p>
This work will have a significant benefit for the rest of the kernel,
though, even if it doesn't change the generated code in most cases.  With
the current <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> pattern, there is no indication of
what data is being protected.  That makes it hard to reason about
concurrent access, and makes the introduction of bugs more likely.  Once
this work is done, the locking rules for the affected data structures will
be documented; in many cases, that may make it possible to stop disabling
software interrupts entirely in favor of a more focused locking scheme.
<p>
This patch set is in its sixth revision.  Previous postings have resulted
in some significant changes, mostly in how some networking subsystems were
changed to use the new mechanism; the core concept has remained mostly the
same.  A few developers have indicated their acceptance of this work, so
chances are good that it will find its way upstream before too long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>The best source of information about the proposed change is <a href="https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1577/">Siewior's LPC 2023 talk</a>.   In that presentation he showed an example of how replacing local_bh_disable() with local_locks allowed a block softirq to preempt a network one since the block hard IRQ's priority was greater than the network hard IRQ's.   That change would be a giant benefit in cases where softirqs don't touch the same data and could run concurrently.</p>

<p>local_locks are  scoped, meaning that their addition requires no new goto labels to free the lock.   Thus they not only improve performance, but are rather elegant.</p>

<p>Given that tools for monitoring and debugging lock behavior are bountiful and those for softirqs not so much, the patches would have the added benefit of making the kernel easier to understand.</p>

<p>If local_bh_disable() can be eventually replaced at most of its current  300+ call sites, that change would make RT Linux more competitive with well-known RTOSes.    Now we just need an ASIL rating for the kernel that is not "QM."</p>

Efforts to move the timer softirq out of ksoftirqd have been underway for years, but have had limited success.   Perhaps this completely new approach is better.

Are they, inherently? Looking through include/linux/local_lock.h and include/linux/local_lock_internal.h I don't see any such thing.<br>
<p>
Looking at the slides you link, I see usage of scoped_guard(), which is new to me. It seems opt-in, so it'd be a matter of awareness and conventional usage. It also seems like it's available for other lock types (e.g., spinlock, mutex). Anyway, looks nice!<br>

Right, this is not inherent to the new local lock, but it's probably the first locking primitive introduced with the infrastructure available, and thus more likely to use it in general.<br>
<p>
You can also easily add your own new types, e.g. to use in a specific subsystem/driver, using the DEFINE_GUARD() macro, see e.g. guard(rcu)(); use.<br>

When the Linux SocketCAN latecy is compared with our CAN FD stack developed for RTEMS RTOS on the same hardware then there is really big reserve. Our RTEMS stack results have been published on international CAN Conference but article is not yet made publically available by CiA. But Michal Lenc's thesis includes results as well and RTEMS with full load of its integrate BSD TCP/IP stack fits to 65 usec in all cases (compare with Linux worst cases on loaded RT kernel up to 10 msec).<br>

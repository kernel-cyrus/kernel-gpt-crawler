           <p>This article was contributed by Steven Rostedt</p>
           </div>
<p>Throughout the history of Linux, people have been wanting to add static
tracepoints &mdash; functions that record data at a specific site in the
kernel for later retrieval &mdash; to the kernel. Those efforts weren't
very successful because of the fear that tracepoints would sacrifice
performance.  Unlike the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/370423/">Ftrace
function tracer</a>, a tracepoint can record more than just the function
being entered.  A tracepoint can record local variables of the function.
Over time, 
various strategies for adding tracepoints have been tried, with varying
success, and the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro is the latest way to add
kernel tracepoints.

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
Mathieu Desnoyers worked on adding a very low overhead tracer hook called
trace markers. Even though the trace markers solved the performance issue by using
cleverly crafted macros,
the information that the trace marker would record was embedded at the location
in the core kernel as a printf format. This upset several core kernel developers
as it made the core kernel code look like debug code was left scattered throughout.
</p>

<p>
In trying to appease the kernel developers, Mathieu came up with tracepoints.
The tracepoint included a function call in the kernel code that, when enabled,
would call a callback function passing the parameters of the tracepoint to that
function as if the callback function was called with those parameters.
This was much better than the trace markers since it allowed the passing of
type casted pointers that the callback functions could dereference, as
opposed to 
the marker interface, which required the callback function to parse a string.
With the tracepoint, the callback function could efficiently take whatever it
needed from the structures. 

<p>
Although this was an
improvement over trace markers, it was still too tedious for developers
to create a callback for every tracepoint they wanted to add, so that a
tracer would 
output its data. 
The kernel needed a more automated way to connect a tracer to
the tracepoints.
That would require automating the creation of the callback and 
also format its data, much like what the trace marker did, but it should be
done in the callback,
and not at the tracepoint site in the kernel code.
<p>

<p>To solve this issue of automating the tracepoints, the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro
was born. Inspired by Tom Zanussi's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/321384/">zedtrace</a>,
this macro was specifically made to allow a developer to add tracepoints to
their subsystem and have Ftrace automatically be able to trace them. The developer
need not understand how Ftrace works, they only need
to create their tracepoint using the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro. In addition, they
need to follow some guidelines in
how to create a header file and they would gain full access to the Ftrace tracer.
Another objective of the design of the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro
was to not couple it to Ftrace or any other tracer. It
is agnostic to the tracers that use it, which is apparent now that
<tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> 
is also used by perf, LTTng and SystemTap.</p>

<h4>The anatomy of the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro</h4>

<p>
Automating tracepoints had various requirements that must be fulfilled:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It must create a tracepoint that can be placed in the kernel code.
<p>
<li>It must create a callback function that can be hooked to this tracepoint.
<p>
<li>The callback function must be able to record the data passed to it
into the tracer ring buffer in the fastest way possible.
<p>
<li>It must create a function that can parse the data recorded to
the ring buffer and translate it to a human readable format that the tracer
can display to a user.
</ul>

<p>
To accomplish that, the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro is broken into
six components, which correspond to the parameters of the macro:
</p>

<pre>
   TRACE_EVENT(name, proto, args, struct, assign, print)
</pre>

<ul>
<li><tt>name</tt> - the name of the tracepoint to be created.
<p>
<li><tt>prototype</tt> - the prototype for the tracepoint callbacks
<p>
<li><tt>args</tt> - the arguments that match the prototype.
<p>
<li><tt>struct</tt> - the structure that a tracer could use (but is not required to)
 to store the data passed into the tracepoint.
<p>
<li><tt>assign</tt> - the C-like way to assign the data to the structure.
<p>
<li><tt>print</tt> - the way to output the structure in human readable ASCII format.
</ul>

<p>
A good example of a tracepoint definition, for sched_switch, can be
found <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/379952/">here</a>. That definition
will be used below to describe 
each of the parts of <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro.
<p>

<p>All parameters except the first one are encapsulated with another macro
(<tt>TP_PROTO</tt>, <tt>TP_ARGS</tt>, <tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt>,
<tt>TP_fast_assign</tt> and <tt>TP_printk</tt>).
These macros give more control in processing
and also allow commas to be used within the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro.
</p>

<h5>Name</h5>
<p>
The first parameter is the name.
</p>

<pre>
   TRACE_EVENT(sched_switch,
</pre>

<p>
This is the name used to call
this tracepoint. The actual tracepoint that is used has <tt>trace_</tt>
prefixed 
to the name (ie. <tt>trace_sched_switch</tt>).

<h5>Prototype</h5>

<p>
The next parameter is the prototype.
</p>

<pre>
    TP_PROTO(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next),
</pre>

<p>
The prototype is written as if you were to declare the tracepoint directly:</p>

<pre>
    trace_sched_switch(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev,
                       struct task_struct *next);
</pre>

<p>
It is used as the prototype for both the tracepoint added to the kernel
code and
for the callback function. Remember, a tracepoint calls the callback functions as
if the callback functions were being called at the location of the tracepoint.
</p>

<h5>Arguments</h5>

<p>The third parameter is the arguments used by the prototype.
</p>

<pre>
    TP_ARGS(rq, prev, next),
</pre>

<p>
It may seem strange that this is needed, but it is not only required by the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt>
macro, it is also required by the tracepoint infrastructure underneath. The tracepoint code,
when activated, will call the callback functions (more than one callback may be assigned
to a given tracepoint). The macro that creates the tracepoint must have access to both
the prototype <i>and</i> the arguments.
Below is an illustration of what a tracepoint macro would need to accomplish this:
</p>

<pre>
    #define TRACE_POINT(name, proto, args) \
       void trace_##name(proto)            \
       {                                   \
               if (trace_##name##_active)  \
                       callback(args);     \
       }
</pre>

<h5>Structure</h5>

<p>
The fourth parameter is a bit more complex.
</p>

<pre>
    TP_STRUCT__entry(
		__array(	char,	prev_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
		__field(	pid_t,	prev_pid			)
		__field(	int,	prev_prio			)
		__field(	long,	prev_state			)
		__array(	char,	next_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
		__field(	pid_t,	next_pid			)
		__field(	int,	next_prio			)
    ),
</pre>

<p>
This parameter describes the structure layout of the data that will be stored in the tracer's
ring buffer.  Each element of the structure is defined
by another macro. These macros are used to automate the creation of a structure
and are not function-like. Notice that the macros are not separated by any
delimiter (no comma nor semicolon).
</p>

<p>
The macros used by the sched_switch tracepoint are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <tt>__field(type, name)</tt> - this defines a normal structure element, like
<tt>int var;</tt> where type is <tt>int</tt> and name is <tt>var</tt>.
<p>
<li> <tt>__array(type, name, len)</tt> - this defines an array item, equivalent to 
<tt>int name[len];</tt> where the type is <tt>int</tt> the name of the array
is <tt>array</tt> and the number of items in the array is <tt>len</tt>.
</ul>

<p>There are other element macros that will be described in a later
article. The definition from the sched_switch
tracepoint would produce a structure that looks like:</p>

<pre>
    struct {
	      char   prev_comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
	      pid_t  prev_pid;
	      int    prev_prio;
	      long   prev_state;
	      char   next_comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
	      pid_t  next_pid;
	      int    next_prio;
    };
</pre>

<p>Note that the spacing used in the <tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt> definition
breaks the rules outlined by <tt>checkpatch.pl</tt>.  That is done because
these macros 
are not function-like but, instead, are used to define a structure.  The spacing
follows the rules of structure spacing and not of function spacing, so that
the names line up in the structure declaration.  Needless to say,
<tt>checkpatch.pl</tt> fails horribly when processing changes to
<tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> definitions.</p>

<h5>Assignment</h5>

<p>The fifth parameter defines the way the data from the parameters
is saved to the ring buffer.
</p>

<pre>
    TP_fast_assign(
		memcpy(__entry-&gt;next_comm, next-&gt;comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
		__entry-&gt;prev_pid	= prev-&gt;pid;
		__entry-&gt;prev_prio	= prev-&gt;prio;
		__entry-&gt;prev_state	= prev-&gt;state;
		memcpy(__entry-&gt;prev_comm, prev-&gt;comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
		__entry-&gt;next_pid	= next-&gt;pid;
		__entry-&gt;next_prio	= next-&gt;prio;
    ),
</pre>

<p>
The code within the <tt>TP_fast_assign()</tt> is
normal C code. A special variable <tt>__entry</tt> represents the pointer to a
structure type defined by <tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt> and points directly
into the ring buffer. The <tt>TP_fast_assign</tt> is used to fill all fields
created in <tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt>.
 The variable names of the parameters
defined by <tt>TP_PROTO</tt> and <tt>TP_ARGS</tt> can then be used to
assign the appropriate data into 
the <tt>__entry</tt> structure.</p>

<h5>Print</h5>

<p>The last parameter defines how a <tt>printk()</tt> can be used
to print out the fields from the <tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt> structure.
</p>

<pre>
	TP_printk("prev_comm=%s prev_pid=%d prev_prio=%d prev_state=%s ==&gt; " \
 		  "next_comm=%s next_pid=%d next_prio=%d",
		__entry-&gt;prev_comm, __entry-&gt;prev_pid, __entry-&gt;prev_prio,
		__entry-&gt;prev_state ?
		  __print_flags(__entry-&gt;prev_state, "|",
				{ 1, "S"} , { 2, "D" }, { 4, "T" }, { 8, "t" },
				{ 16, "Z" }, { 32, "X" }, { 64, "x" },
				{ 128, "W" }) : "R",
		__entry-&gt;next_comm, __entry-&gt;next_pid, __entry-&gt;next_prio)
</pre>

<p>
 Once again the variable
<tt>__entry</tt> is used to reference the pointer to the structure that contains
the data. The format string is just like
any other printf format.
The <tt>__print_flags()</tt> is part of a set of helper functions that come
with <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt>, and will be covered in another article. Do not
create new tracepoint-specific helpers, because that will confuse user-space 
tools that know about the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> helper macros but will not
know how to handle ones created for individual tracepoints.
</p>

<h4>Format file</h4>

<p>
The <tt>sched_switch TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro produces the following format
file in
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/format</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
   name: sched_switch
   ID: 33
   format:
	field:unsigned short common_type;	offset:0;	size:2;
	field:unsigned char common_flags;	offset:2;	size:1;
	field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;	offset:3;	size:1;
	field:int common_pid;	offset:4;	size:4;
	field:int common_lock_depth;	offset:8;	size:4;

	field:char prev_comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];	offset:12;	size:16;
	field:pid_t prev_pid;	offset:28;	size:4;
	field:int prev_prio;	offset:32;	size:4;
	field:long prev_state;	offset:40;	size:8;
	field:char next_comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];	offset:48;	size:16;
	field:pid_t next_pid;	offset:64;	size:4;
	field:int next_prio;	offset:68;	size:4;

   print fmt: "task %s:%d [%d] (%s) ==&gt; %s:%d [%d]", REC-&gt;prev_comm, REC-&gt;prev_pid,
   REC-&gt;prev_prio, REC-&gt;prev_state ? __print_flags(REC-&gt;prev_state, "|", { 1, "S"} ,
   { 2, "D" }, { 4, "T" }, { 8, "t" }, { 16, "Z" }, { 32, "X" }, { 64, "x" }, { 128,
   "W" }) : "R", REC-&gt;next_comm, REC-&gt;next_pid, REC-&gt;next_prio
</pre>

<p>Note: Newer kernels may also display a signed entry for each field.</p>

<p>Notice that <tt>__entry</tt> is replaced with <tt>REC</tt> in the format file. The
first set of fields (<tt>common_*</tt>) are not from the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro, but are added to all events
by Ftrace, which created this format file, other tracers could add
different fields. The format file provides user-space tools the information
needed to 
parse the binary
output containing sched_switch entries.</p>

<h4>The header file</h4>

<p>The <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro cannot just be placed anywhere in the
expectation that it will work with Ftrace or any other tracer. The header file
that contains the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro must follow a certain
format. These header files typically are located in the
<tt>include/trace/events</tt> directory but do not need to be. If they are
not located in this directory, then other configurations are necessary.</p>

<p>The first line in the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> header is not the normal <tt>#ifdef _TRACE_SCHED_H</tt>, but
instead has:</p>

<pre>
   #undef TRACE_SYSTEM
   #define TRACE_SYSTEM sched

   #if !defined(_TRACE_SCHED_H) || defined(TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
   #define _TRACE_SCHED_H
</pre>

<p>This example is for scheduler trace events, other event headers
would use something 
other than <tt>sched</tt> and <tt>_TRACE_SCHED_H</tt>. The
<tt>TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ</tt> test allows
this file to be included more than once; this is important for the processing
of the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro. The <tt>TRACE_SYSTEM</tt> must also be defined for
the file and must be outside the guard of the <tt>#if</tt>. The <tt>TRACE_SYSTEM</tt>
defines what group the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macros in the file belong to. This is also
the directory name that the events will be grouped under in the debugfs
<tt>tracing/events</tt> directory. This grouping is important
for Ftrace as it allows the user to enable or disable events by group.
</p>

<p>
The file then includes any headers required by the contents of the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro.
(e.g. <tt>#include &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt>). The <tt>tracepoint.h</tt> file is
required.</p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;linux/tracepoint.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>All the trace events can now be defined with <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macros.
Please include comments that describe the tracepoint above the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macros. Look at
<tt>include/trace/events/sched.h</tt> as an example. The file ends with:</p>

<pre>
   #endif /* _TRACE_SCHED_H */

   /* This part must be outside protection */
   #include &lt;trace/define_trace.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <tt>define_trace.h</tt> is where all the magic lies in creating the tracepoints.
The explanation of how this file works will be left to another article.
For now, it is sufficient to know that this file must be included at the bottom
of the trace header file outside the protection of the <tt>#endif</tt>.</p>

<h4>Using the tracepoint</h4>

<p>Defining the tracepoint is meaningless if it is not used anywhere.
To use the tracepoint, the trace header must be included, but one C file
(and only one) must also define <tt>CREATE_TRACE_POINTS</tt> before including
the trace. This will cause the <tt>define_trace.h</tt> to create the necessary
functions needed to produce the tracing events. In <tt>kernel/sched.c</tt>
the following is defined:</p>

<pre>
   #define CREATE_TRACE_POINTS
   #include &lt;trace/events/sched.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>If another file needs to use tracepoints that were defined in the trace
file, then it only needs to include the trace file, and does not need to
define <tt>CREATE_TRACE_POINTS</tt>. Defining it more than once for the same header
file will cause linker errors when building. For example, in <tt>kernel/fork.c</tt> only the
header file is included:</p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;trace/events/sched.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>Finally, the tracepoint is used in the code just as it was defined
in the <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro: </p>

<pre>
   static inline void
   context_switch(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev,
	          struct task_struct *next)
   {
	   struct mm_struct *mm, *oldmm;

	   prepare_task_switch(rq, prev, next);
	   <b>trace_sched_switch(rq, prev, next);</b>
	   mm = next-&gt;mm;
	   oldmm = prev-&gt;active_mm;
</pre>

<h4>Coming soon</h4>

<p>This article explained all that is needed to create a basic tracepoint within the
core kernel code. Part 2 will describe how to consolidate tracepoints to
keep the tracing footprint small, along with information about the
<tt>TP_STRUCT__entry</tt> macros and <tt>TP_printk</tt> helper functions
(like <tt>__print_flags</tt>).  Part 3 will look at defining tracepoints
outside of the <tt>include/trace/events</tt> directory (for modules and
architecture-specific tracepoints) as well as a look at how the
<tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro does its magic.  Both articles will have a few
practical examples of how to use tracepoints.  Stay tuned ...</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are two conflicting formats described in this document:<br>
<p>
1) prev_comm=kcompactd0 prev_pid=21 prev_prio=120 prev_state=S ==&gt; next_comm=rcu_preempt next_pid=13 next_prio=120<br>
2) task kcompactd0:21 [120] (S) ==&gt; rcu_preempt:13 [120]<br>
<p>
The second one appears to be wrong.  It is not what you will see when you read '/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/format'.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 22, 2010</br>
           </div>
The original workqueue code found its way into the mainline without a great
deal of discussion or debate; it was a clear improvement over what came
before.  Tejun Heo's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/355700/">concurrency-managed workqueues</a>
(CMWQ) rework has the potential to be a significant improvement as well, but its
path toward merging has not been so smooth.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/392037/">fifth iteration of the patch set</a>
is currently under discussion.  While a number of concerns have been
addressed, others have come out of the woodwork to replace them.
<p>

The CMWQ work is intended to address a number of problems with current
kernel workqueues.  At the top of the list is the proliferation of kernel
threads; current workqueues can, on a large system, run the kernel out of
process IDs before user space ever gets a chance to run.  Despite all these
threads, current workqueues are not particularly good at keeping the system
busy; workqueues may contain a backlog of work while the CPU sits idle.
Workqueues can also be subject to deadlocks if locking is not handled very
carefully.  As a result, the kernel has grown a number of
workarounds and some competing deferred-work mechanisms.
<p>
To resolve these problems, the CMWQ code maintains a set of worker threads
on each processor; these threads are shared between workqueues, so the
system is not overrun with workqueue-specific threads.  The special
scheduler class once used by CMWQ is long gone, but the code still has hooks
into the scheduler which it can use to track which worker threads are
actually executing at any given time.  If all workqueue threads on a CPU
have blocked waiting on some resource, and if there is queued work to do,
the CMWQ code will kick off a new thread to work on it.  The CMWQ code can
run multiple jobs from the same CPU concurrently - something the current
workqueue code will not do.  In this way, the
CPU is always kept busy as long as there is work to be done.
<p>
The first complaint that came back this time was that many developers had
long since forgotten what CMWQ was all about, and Tejun had not put that
information into the patch series introduction.  He made up for that with
<a href="/Articles/393172/">an overview document</a> explaining the basics
of the code.  That led quickly to a new complaint: the lack of dedicated
worker threads means that it is no longer possible to change the scheduling
behavior of specific workqueues.
<p>
There were two variants of this complaint.  Daniel Walker <a
href="/Articles/393173/">lamented</a> the loss of the ability to change the
priority of workqueue threads from user space.  Tejun has firmly denied
that this is a useful thing to be able to do, and Daniel has not, yet,
shown an example of where it would be desirable.  Andrew Morton, instead,
<a href="/Articles/393174/">worries</a> about being able to change
scheduling behavior from within the kernel; that is something that at least
one driver does now.  He <a href="/Articles/393175/">might be willing</a>
to let this capability go, but he's not happy about it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Oh well.  Kernel threads should not be running with RT policy
	anyway.  RT is a userspace feature, and whenever a kernel thread
	uses RT it degrades userspace RT qos.  But I expect that using RT
	in kernel threads is sometimes the best tradeoff, so let's not
	pretend that we're getting something for nothing here!
</div>
<p>
Tejun's reply to this concern takes a couple of forms.  One is that
workqueues are intended for general-purpose asynchronous work, and that is
how almost all callers use it.  It would be better, he says, to make
special mechanisms for situations where they are really needed.  To that
end, he has posted a simple <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/392783/">kthread_worker API</a> which can be
used for the creation of special-purpose worker threads.  Essentially, one
starts by setting up a <tt>kthread_worker</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_KTHREAD_WORKER(worker);
    /* ... or ... */
    struct kthread_worker worker;
    init_kthread_worker(&amp;worker);
</pre>
<p>
Then, a kernel thread should be set up using the (existing)
<tt>kthread_create()</tt> or <tt>kthread_run()</tt> utilities, but passing
a pointer to <tt>kthread_worker_fn()</tt> as the actual function to run:
<p>
<pre>
    struct task_struct thread;

    thread = kthread_run(kthread_worker_fn, &amp;worker, "name" ...);
</pre>
<p>
Thereafter, it's just a matter of filling in <tt>kthread_work</tt>
structures with actual work to be done and queueing them with:
<p>
<pre>
    bool queue_kthread_work(struct kthread_worker *worker,
                            struct kthread_work *work);
</pre>
<p>
So far, there has been no real commentary on this patch.
<p>
The other thing which could be done is to associate attributes like
priority and CPU affinity with the work to be done instead of with the
thread doing the work.  That would require expanding the workqueue API to
allow this information to be specified; the CMWQ code would then tweak
worker threads accordingly when passing jobs to them.  At this point,
though, it's not clear that there is enough need for this feature to
justify the added complexity that it would require.
<p>
The CMWQ code certainly adds a bit of complexity already, though it makes
up for some of that by replacing the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/329464/">slow work</a> and <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/314808/">asynchronous function call</a>
mechanisms.  Tejun is hoping to drop it into linux-next shortly, and,
presumably, to get it merged for 2.6.36.  Whether that will happen remains
to be seen; core kernel changes can be hard, and this one may not, yet,
have cleared its last hurdle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

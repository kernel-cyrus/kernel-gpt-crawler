<p>
The recently released Linux Trace Toolkit next generation (LTTng) 2.0
tracer is the result of a two-year 
development cycle 
involving a team of dedicated developers. Unlike its predecessor, LTTng
0.x, it can be installed on a vanilla or distribution kernel without any
patches. It also performs combined tracing of both the kernel and
user space, and has many more features that will be detailed in this
article and its successor.

<h4>Why LTTng 2.0?</h4>

<p>
The main motivation behind LTTng 2.0 is that we identified a strong
demand for user-space tracing, and we noticed that targeting a user base
broader than developers required a lot of work focusing on usability.
Moving forward toward these goals led us to the unification of the
tracer control and user interface (UI) for both kernel and user-space tracing.

<p>
Some might wonder why we did not go down the Perf or Ftrace path for
our development. Perf does not meet our performance needs, and is
in many ways designed specifically for the Linux kernel (e.g. the trace
format is kernel-specific). As for Ftrace, its performance is similar to
that of LTTng, 
but its main focus is on simplicity for kernel debugging use-cases,
which means a single user, single tracing session, and single set of
buffers. It also has a trace format specifically tuned for the Linux
kernel, which does not meet our requirements.


<h4>LTTng 2.0 features</h4>

<p>
LTTng 2.0 is pretty much a rewrite of the older 0.x LTTng versions,
but now focusing on usability and end-user experience. It builds on the
solid foundations of LTTng 0.x for data transport, uses the existing
Linux kernel instrumentation mechanisms, and makes the flexible
<a href="http://www.efficios.com/ctf">CTF (Common Trace Format)</a>
available to end users. For example, that allows 
prepending arbitrary performance monitoring unit (PMU) counter values to each
traced event. 

<p>
LTTng provides an integrated interface for both kernel and user-space
tracing. A "tracing" group allows non-root users to control tracing and
read the generated traces. It is multi-user aware, and allows multiple
concurrent tracing sessions.

<p>
LTTng allows access to tracepoints, function tracing, CPU 
PMU counters, kprobes, and kretprobes. It provides the
ability to attach "context" information to events in the trace (e.g.
any PMU counter, process and thread ID, container-aware virtual PIDs and
TIDs, process name, etc). All the extra information fields to be
collected with events are optional, specified on a per-tracing-session
basis (except for timestamp and event id, which are mandatory).  It works
on mainline kernels (2.6.38 or higher) without any patches.

<p>
The Common Trace Format specification
has been designed in collaboration with various industry participants to
suit the tracing tool interoperability needs of the embedded,
telecommunications, high-performance, and Linux kernel communities. It is
designed to allow traces to be natively generated by the Linux kernel,
Linux user-space applications written in C/C++, and hardware components.

One major element of CTF is the Trace Stream Description Language (TSDL)
which flexibly enables description of various binary trace stream
layouts. It supports reading and writing traces on architectures with
different endian-ness and type sizes, including bare metal generating
trace data that is addressed in a bitwise manner. The trace data is
represented in a
native binary format for increased tracing speed and compactness, but can
be read and analyzed
on any other machine that supports the Babeltrace data converter.

align="right" width=350 height=262 alt="[LTTng architecture]">
</a>

In addition
to specifying the disk data storage format, CTF is designed to be streamed
over the 
network through TCP or UDP, or sent through a serial interface. The
storage format allows discarding the oldest pieces of information when
keeping flight-recorder buffers in memory to support snapshot use cases.
The flexible layout also enables features such as attaching additional
context information to each event, and the layout acts as an index that
allows fast seeking through very large traces (many GB).

<p>
LTTng is a high-performance tracer that produces very compact trace
data, with low overhead on the traced system.
A somewhat dense overview of the LTTng 2.0 architecture can be seen at
right, click through for a larger view.

<h4>Tracer strengths overview</h4>

<p>
The diversity of tracing tools available in Linux today can baffle users
trying to pick which one to use. Each has been developed with
different use cases in mind, which makes the motto "use the right tool
for the job" very appropriate. In this section, we present the
strengths of the major Linux kernel tracing tools.

Please keep in mind that the authors tried to keep
an objective perspective when writing this section, which is based on
information 
received during the past years' conferences. 

<h4>LTTng 2.0</h4>

<p>
The targeted LTTng audience includes anyone responsible for production
systems, system administrators, and application developers. LTTng focuses on
providing a system-wide view (across software stack layers) with detailed
combined application and system-level execution traces, without adding
too much overhead to the traced system.

<p>
One downside of LTTng 2.0 is that it is not
provided by the upstream kernel: it requires that either the distribution, or
the end user, install separate packages. LTTng 2.0 is also not geared
toward kernel development: it currently does not support integration
with kernel crash dump tools, nor does it support kernel early boot tracing.

<p>
LTTng is best suited to finding performance slowdowns or latency issues
(e.g. long delays) in 
production or while doing development when the cause is either unknown or comes
from the interaction between various software/hardware components.
It can also be used to monitor production systems and desktops (in flight recorder mode) and
trigger an execution trace snapshot when an error occurs, which provides
detailed reports to system administrators and developers.
(Note: flight recorder support was available in LTTng 0.x, but is not
fully supported by the LTTng 2.0 tracing session daemon. Stay tuned for
the 2.1 release currently in preparation.)


<h4>Perf</h4>

<p>
Perf is very good at sampling hardware and software counters. The key
feature around which it has been designed is per-process performance
counter sampling for the kernel and user space. It targets both user space and
kernel developer audiences. Perf is multi-user aware, although it
allows tracing from non-root users for per-process information only. 

<p>
Perf's
event header is fixed, with extensible payload definitions. Therefore,
although new events can be added, the content of its event header is
fixed by its ABI. Its tracing infrastructure resides at kernel-level
only. That means tracing user space requires round-trips to the kernel,
which causes a performance hit. Tracing features have been added
using the same infrastructure developed for sampling.

<p>
In development environments, Perf is useful as a hardware performance
counter and 
kernel-level software event sampler for a process (or group of
processes). It can give insight into the major bottlenecks slowing down
process execution, when the cause of the slowdown can be pinpointed to a
particular set of processes.


<h4>Ftrace</h4>

<p>
Ftrace has been designed with function tracing as primary purpose; it also
supports tracepoint instrumentation and dynamic probing. It
has efficient mechanisms to quickly collect data and to filter out
information that is not interesting to the user.
Ftrace targets a kernel
developer audience, including console output integration that allows
dumping tracing buffers upon a kernel crash. Its event headers are fixed by
the ABI, with extensible event payload definitions. Its ring buffer is
heavily optimized for performance, but it allows only a single user to trace
at any given time. Its tracing infrastructure resides at kernel-level
only. Therefore, similar to Perf, tracing user space requires a
round-trip to the kernel, which causes a performance hit.

<p>
In development environments, Ftrace is suited for kernel developers who
want to debug 
bugs and latency issues occurring at kernel-level. One of the major
Ftrace strengths over Perf is its low overhead. It is therefore
well-suited for tracing high-throughput data coming from frequently hit
tracepoints or from function entry/exit instrumentation on busy systems.

<h4>LTTng 2.0 usage examples</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://lttng.org/lttng2.0/">LTTng 2.0</a> can be <a href="http://lttng.org/download">installed</a> on a
recent Linux distribution without 
requiring any kernel changes.
The individual package README files contain the installation
instructions and dependencies.
When using lttng for kernel tracing from the tracing group, the
lttng-sessiond daemon needs to be started as root beforehand. This is
usually performed by init scripts for Linux distributions.

<p>
The user interface entry point to LTTng 2.0 is the <tt>lttng</tt> command. The
same actions can also be performed programmatically through the <tt>lttng.h</tt>
API and the <tt>liblttng</tt> library.


<h4>1. Kernel activity overview with tracepoints</h4>

<p>
Tracing the kernel activity can be done by enabling all tracepoints and
then starting a trace session. This sequence of commands will show a
human-readable text log of the system activity (run as root or a user in
the tracing group):

<pre>
    # lttng create
    # lttng enable-event --kernel --all
    # lttng start
    # sleep 10	      # let the system generate some activity
    # lttng stop
    # lttng view
    # lttng destroy
</pre>

<p>
Here is an example of the event text output (with annotation), generated by
using:
<pre>
    # lttng view -e "babeltrace -n all"
</pre>
to show all field names:

<pre>
    timestamp = 18:27:42.301503743,	# Event timestamp
    delta = +0.000001871,		# Timestamp delta from previous event
    name = sys_recvfrom,		# Event name
    stream.packet.context = {		# Stream-specific context information
	cpu_id = 3	      		# CPU which has written this event
    },
    event.fields = {			# Event payload
	fd = 4,
	ubuf = 0x7F9C100AD074,
	size = 4096,
	flags = 0,
	addr = 0x0,
	addr_len = 0x0
    }
</pre>

<p>
To get the list of available tracepoints:

<pre>
    # lttng list --kernel
</pre>

<p>
Specific tracepoints can be traced with:

<pre>
    # lttng enable-event --kernel irq_handler_entry,irq_handler_exit
    # this can be followed by more "lttng enable-event" commands.
</pre>

<h4>2. Dynamic Probes</h4>

<p>
This second example shows how to plant a dynamic probe (kprobe) in the
kernel and gather information from the probe:

<pre>
    # lttng create
    # lttng enable-event --kernel sys_open --probe sys_open+0x0
    # lttng enable-event --kernel sys_close --probe sys_close+0x0
    	    	      # run "lttng enable-event" for more details
    # lttng start
    # sleep 10        # let the system generate some activity
    # lttng stop
    # lttng view
    # lttng destroy
</pre>

<p>
Example event generated:
<pre>
    timetamp = 18:32:53.198603728,	# Event timestamp
    delta = +0.000013485,		# Timestamp delta from previous event
    name = sys_open,			# event name
    stream.packet.context = {		# Stream-specific context information
	cpu_id = 1			# CPU which has written this event
    },
    event.fields = {
	ip = 0xFFFFFFFF810F2185		# Instruction pointer where probe was planted
    }
</pre>

<p>
All instrumentation sources can be combined and collected within a
trace session.


<h4>To be continued ...</h4>

<p>
LTTng 2.0 (code named "Annedd'ale") was released on
March 20, 2012. It will be available as a package in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
and should be available shortly for other distributions.

<p>
Only text output is currently available by using the
Babeltrace converter. LTTngTop (which will be covered in part 2) is usable,
although it is still under
development. The graphical viewer LTTV and the Eclipse LTTng plugin are
currently being migrated to LTTng 2.0. Both LTTngTop and LTTV will
re-use the Babeltrace trace reading library, while the Eclipse LTTng
plugin implements a CTF reading library in Java.

<p>
Part 2 of this article, will feature more usage examples including
combined user space and kernel tracing, adding PMU
counter contexts along with kernel tracing, a presentation of
the new LTTngTop tool, and a discussion of the upstream plans for the project.

<h1>Tracking down a &quot;runaway loop&quot;</h1>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>December 10, 2008</br>

<p>
The Linux boot process, at least as provided by distributions,
depends on help from user space, with 
drivers being loaded as required from the initial filesystem (initramfs/initrd).
Loading drivers requires using tools built into initramfs and
if those tools break, the kernel won't boot.  But when a working kernel
configuration and initramfs are used with a new kernel, the result
is expected to be a kernel that successfully boots.  When that doesn't
happen, bugs are filed regarding kernel regressions but, as a recent
example shows, the actual problem may be elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The original <a href="/Articles/310472/">report</a> was made in late
October, but no progress was made until Evgeniy Polyakov <a
href="/Articles/310473/">saw it again</a> in early December.  The symptom
was a kernel that hangs after printing:
<pre>
    request_module: runaway loop modprobe char-major-5-1
</pre>
four times on the console.  Since nothing in the user space (initramfs)
or kernel configuration had changed, it seemed to clearly point to
something in the 
kernel itself.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the "runaway loop" message is meant to indicate that the
<tt>request_module()</tt> function has been invoked recursively.  So in an
effort to load the driver for the character device with major/minor numbers
5/1&mdash;which corresponds to
<tt>/dev/console</tt>&mdash;<tt>request_module()</tt> was invoked again.
The code in <tt>kernel/kmod.c</tt>:  
<pre>
        if (atomic_read(&amp;kmod_concurrent) > max_modprobes) {
                /* We may be blaming an innocent here, but unlikely */
                if (kmod_loop_msg++ < 5)
                        printk(KERN_ERR
                               "request_module: runaway loop modprobe %s\n",
                               module_name);
                atomic_dec(&amp;kmod_concurrent);
                return -ENOMEM;
        }
</pre>
only allows that message to be printed four times, but the invoker should
recognize the <tt>ENOMEM</tt> and handle it appropriately.

<p> The root cause was that something in the kernel was trying to access
<tt>/dev/console</tt> before that device was registered in the kernel.
This led the kernel to try and load a module to handle
<tt>/dev/console</tt>, which will fail.  Because of the failure, something
in the user space 
<tt>modprobe</tt> then tries to access <tt>/dev/console</tt>, presumably to
output an error message, which repeats the kernel module loading process.
And so on.
After that recurses enough to exceed the <tt>max_modprobes</tt> limit,
<tt>request_module()</tt> will produce the runaway loop message and return
<tt>ENOMEM</tt> which <i>should</i> put a stop to the whole process.  </p>

<p>
In an acrimonious thread&mdash;and <a
href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12153">kernel bug
report</a>&mdash;Alan Cox, Kay Sievers, and Polyakov tried to 
determine where the problem came from and what to do about it.  It didn't
help matters that they were using different distribution's initramfs
so that they saw different behavior.  Polyakov/Sievers were using Debian
user space while Cox was using Fedora.  Something in the Debian version was
continuing to try to open <tt>/dev/console</tt> even after getting
<tt>ENOMEM</tt>.  This leads to an infinite loop, thus a kernel hang.
</p>

<p>
Sievers eventually <a
href="/Articles/310489/">tracked it to the kernel cryptographic API</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
It is caused by:
  "modprobe cryptomgr" called from swapper[1]
<p>
This modprobe process does try to log an error, accesses /dev/console,
which is not initialized in the kernel at that time, and the kernel
module loader tries the load a module to support dev_t 5:1, which
again runs modprobe, and ...
<p>
Setting CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER=y makes it disappear.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the crypto layer attempts to load the cryptomgr module as
part of its algorithm testing infrastructure.  If cryptomgr fails to load,
the algorithm registration code can continue without it.  It is optional,
but <tt>modprobe</tt> wants to put out a message when it fails to load it,
which leads to the runaway loop.  As Herbert Xu <a
href="/Articles/310492/">points out</a>, though, the problem is not
crypto-specific at all:
<div class="BigQuote">
In any case the loop itself does not involve any crypto components
so I don't think making changes in the crypto layer is going to
make this go away forever as anyone calling request_module early
enough will get into this loop.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It is this potential pitfall that Sievers and Polyakov would like to see
removed.  In 
general, user-space programs are not required to be concerned with the
availability of <tt>/dev/console</tt>&mdash;except when they are run from
early kernel initialization.  But Cox points out that user-space helpers must
concern themselves 
with avoiding loops because there are multiple possible ways to cause that
to happen.
As an example, he notes that if UNIX-domain sockets (AF_UNIX) are in a
module and <tt>syslog()</tt> is called before the module is loaded, a
similar loop will occur. 
</p>

<p>
In an effort to "step back" from the arguments that were going back and
forth, Ted Ts'o <a href="/Articles/310523/">offers his analysis</a> of the
problem along with a suggested course of action:
<div class="BigQuote">
There is a dispute about whether it is looping forever, or whether it
should be getting caught by kernel/kmod.c's modprobe recursion
detector.  Alan has checked the recursion detector and reports that it
works just fine; Evgeniy and Kay are claiming that it in fact loops
forever, and the recursion detector is not working.
<p>
[...] So I would think the best thing to do is to figure out what Debian's
initrd is doing that is evading the recursion detection.  Fixing that
is going to make things much more robust.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Clearly the recursion detector is working to some extent, or the runaway
loop messages would not be seen, but on Debian, at least, that detection
doesn't stop the problem.  Ts'o's theory is that something outside of
directly invoked helper is actually the culprit: "<q>I'm guessing why
it isn't working given Debian's initrd setup is that whatever is
ultimately opening /dev/console isn't being called until after the
helper script has exited.</q>"  That seems worth tracking down as Ts'o
points out in a <a href="/Articles/310524/">later message</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
It would be good to make sure we understand what
the root causes for while the modprobe recursion detector is
apparently not triggering, since it could be that Debian's initrd
might cause some other uncaught recursion loop if we don't drive this
problem determination to root cause.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The exact cause of the problem and why Debian and Fedora behave differently
is still not known.  Digging into Debian's initrd to figure that out, as
Ts'o suggests, is clearly the right starting point.  That answer will
likely lead to sensible fixes, either in user space or the
kernel&mdash;possibly both.
Bickering about where and how to fix the problem before it is fully
understood seems counter-productive at best.

Just in case somebody runs into a similar error like the one Vim[1] (&amp; more recently I) ran into<br>
<p>
request_module: runaway loop modprobe char-major-0-20481<br>
<p>
This is actually the same problem as the missing '/dev/console' but the device files get mangled somehow on the nfs server system.<br>
<p>
Note that /dev/console is normally (maj,min) 5,1, but in this case, the kernel is pressed to search for 0,20481 which is notably outside the usual numeric range for device nodes.<br>
<p>
I discovered this problem while using VMWare to run a Linux instance with an NFS root hosted from Mac OS X, while Vim discovered this problem doing the same but while running Windows. <br>
<p>
It turns out that, if you run 'mknod -m 600 console c 5 1; mknod -m 666 null c 1 3', and then read the result back from within the VMWare instance of Linux, it's identified as follows:<br>
<p>
# ls -la console null<br>
crw------- 1 root root 0, 20481 Jun  3  2011 console<br>
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0,  4099 Jun  3  2011 null<br>
<p>
The solution: don't use mknod on Mac OS X or cygwin ;-) <br>
<p>
In my case I created these critical device nodes on the NFS root from within the VMWare Linux instance with the use of a livecd iso, as a last resort.<br>
<p>
In case anyone is interested, after re-creating the 'correct' device nodes using the VMWare Linux instance, the respective files on the nfs root (Mac OS X) show up as follows:<br>
<p>
$ ls -la console null<br>

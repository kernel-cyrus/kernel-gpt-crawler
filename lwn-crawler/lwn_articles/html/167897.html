<h1>The high-resolution timer API</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 16, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Last September, this page featured <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/152436/">an article on the ktimers patch</a>
by Thomas Gleixner.  The new timer abstraction was designed to enable the
provision of high-resolution timers in the kernel and to address some of
the inefficiencies encountered when the current timer code is used in this mode.
Since then, there has been a large amount of
discussion, and the code has seen significant work.  The end product of
that work, now called "hrtimers," was merged for the 2.6.16 release.
<p>

At its core, the hrtimer mechanism remains the same.  Rather than using the
"timer wheel" data structure, hrtimers live on a time-sorted linked list,
with the next timer to expire being at the head of the list.  A separate
red/black tree is also used to enable the insertion and removal of timer
events without scanning through the list.  But while the core
remains the same, just about everything else has changed, at least
superficially.
<p>

There is a new type, <tt>ktime_t</tt>, which is used to store a time value
in nanoseconds.  This type, found in <tt>&lt;linux/ktime.h&gt;</tt>, is
meant to be used as an opaque structure.  And, interestingly, its
definition changes depending on the underlying architecture.  On 64-bit
systems, a <tt>ktime_t</tt> is really just a 64-bit integer value in
nanoseconds.  On 32-bit machines, however, it is a two-field structure: one
32-bit value holds the number of seconds, and the other holds nanoseconds.
The order of the two fields depends on whether the host architecture is
big-endian or not; they are always arranged so that the two values can,
when needed, be treated as a single, 64-bit value.  Doing things this way
complicates the header files, but it provides for efficient time value
manipulation on all architectures.
<p>

A whole set of functions and macros has been provided for working with
<tt>ktime_t</tt> values, starting with the traditional two ways to declare
and initialize them:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_KTIME(name);   /* Initialize to zero */

    ktime_t kt;
    kt = ktime_set(long secs, long nanosecs);
</pre>
<p>

Various other functions exist for changing <tt>ktime_t</tt> values; all of
these treat their arguments as read-only and return a <tt>ktime_t</tt>
value as their result:
<p>
<pre>
    ktime_t ktime_add(ktime_t kt1, ktime_t kt2);
    ktime_t ktime_sub(ktime_t kt1, ktime_t kt2);  /* kt1 - kt2 */
    ktime_t ktime_add_ns(ktime_t kt, u64 nanoseconds);
</pre>
<p>
Finally, there are some type conversion functions:
<p>
<pre>
    ktime_t timespec_to_ktime(struct timespec tspec);
    ktime_t timeval_to_ktime(struct timeval tval);
    struct timespec ktime_to_timespec(ktime_t kt);
    struct timeval ktime_to_timeval(ktime_t kt);
    clock_t ktime_to_clock_t(ktime_t kt);
    u64 ktime_to_ns(ktime_t kt);
</pre>

<p>
The interface for hrtimers can be found in
<tt>&lt;linux/hrtimer.h&gt;</tt>.  A timer is represented by <tt>struct
hrtimer</tt>, which must be initialized with:
<p>
<pre>
    void hrtimer_init(struct hrtimer *timer, clockid_t which_clock);
</pre>
<p>
Every hrtimer is bound to a specific clock.  The system currently
supports two clocks, being:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt>: a clock which is guaranteed always to move 
     forward in time, but which does not reflect "wall clock time" in any
     specific way.  In the current implementation, <tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt>
     resembles the <tt>jiffies</tt> tick count in that it starts at zero
     when the system boots and increases monotonically from there.
<p>
<li> <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME</tt> which matches the current real-world time.
</ul>
<p>
The difference between the two clocks can be seen when the system time is
adjusted, perhaps as a result of administrator action, tweaking by the
network time protocol code, or suspending and resuming the system.  In any
of these situations, <tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt> will tick forward as if
nothing had happened, while <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME</tt> may see discontinuous
changes.  Which clock should be used will depend mainly on whether the
timer needs to be tied to time as the rest of the world sees it or not.
The call to <tt>hrtimer_init()</tt> will tie an hrtimer to a specific
clock, but that clock can be changed with:
<p>
<pre>
    void hrtimer_rebase(struct hrtimer *timer, clockid_t new_clock);
</pre>
<p>
Most of the <tt>hrtimer</tt> fields should not be touched.  Two of them,
however, must be set by the user:
<p>
<pre>
    int  (*function)(void *);
    void *data;
</pre>
<p>
As one might expect, <tt>function()</tt> will be called when the timer
expires, with <tt>data</tt> as its parameter.  
<p>
Actually setting a timer is accomplished with:
<p>
<pre>
    int hrtimer_start(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time,
                      enum hrtimer_mode mode);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>mode</tt> parameter describes how the <tt>time</tt> parameter should be
interpreted.  A <tt>mode</tt> of <tt>HRTIMER_ABS</tt> indicates that
<tt>time</tt> is an absolute value, while <tt>HRTIMER_REL</tt> indicates
that <tt>time</tt> should be interpreted relative to the current time.
<p>

Under normal operation, <tt>function()</tt> will be called after (at least)
the requested expiration time.  The hrtimer code implements a shortcut for
situations where the sole purpose of a timer is to wake up a process on
expiration: if <tt>function()</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, the process whose task
structure is pointed to by <tt>data</tt> will be awakened.  In most cases,
however, code which uses hrtimers will provide a callback
<tt>function()</tt>.  That function has an integer return value, which
should be either <tt>HRTIMER_NORESTART</tt> (for a one-shot timer which
should not be started again) or <tt>HRTIMER_RESTART</tt> for a recurring
timer. 
<p>

In the restart case, the callback must set a new expiration time before
returning.  Usually, restarting timers are used by kernel subsystems which
need a callback at a regular interval.  The hrtimer code provides a
function for advancing the expiration time to the next such interval: 
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long hrtimer_forward(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t interval);
</pre>
<p>
This function will advance the timer's expiration time by the given
<tt>interval</tt>.  If necessary, the interval will be added more than once
to yield an expiration time in the future.  Generally, the need to add the
interval more than once means that the system has overrun its timer
period, perhaps as a result of high system load.  The return value from
<tt>hrtimer_forward()</tt> is the number of missed intervals, allowing code
which cares to detect and respond to the situation.  

<p>
Outstanding timers can be canceled with either of:
<p>
<pre>
    int hrtimer_cancel(struct hrtimer *timer);
    int hrtimer_try_to_cancel(struct hrtimer *timer);
</pre>
<p>
When <tt>hrtimer_cancel()</tt> returns, the caller can be sure that the
timer is no longer active, and that its expiration function is not running
anywhere in the system.  The return value will be zero if the timer was not
active (meaning it had already expired, normally), or one if the timer was
successfully canceled.  <tt>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</tt> does the same,
but will not wait if the timer function is running; it will, instead,
return -1 in that situation.
<p>
A canceled timer can be restarted by passing it to
<tt>hrtimer_restart()</tt>.
<p>

<p>
Finally, there is a small set of query functions.
<tt>hrtimer_get_remaining()</tt> returns the amount of time left before a
timer expires.  A call to <tt>hrtimer_active()</tt> returns nonzero if the
timer is currently on the queue.  And a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int hrtimer_get_res(clockid_t which_clock, struct timespec *tp);
</pre>
<p>
will return the true resolution of the given clock, in nanoseconds.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I might misunderstand something, but will this code work on 32 bit architectures after 2038? In this case the seconds value of ktime_t is only 32 bit long and if the timer is bound to CLOCK_REALTIME, is it possible to install a timer that will expire sometime in 2038 with the HRTIMER_ABS mode?
<P>

      There's no requirement that the epoch for ktime_t be the same as for time_t. (Or, if there is, I missed it...)<br>

      A question that may not be sensible at all, as this concerns kernel functions: will these functions be usable from userspace somehow, to achieve better precision than e.g. 0.01 second when using functions like usleep() or gettimeofday() ?  I am not familiar with the technical details, but my earlier attempts at achieving greater time resolution all failed.<br>
<p>
Is there already a common way to achieve higher resolution from a C program?<br>

      I suppose I could have said something about that...  hrtimers are used now for the implementation of POSIX timers and for the <tt>nanosleep()</tt> call, so, in that sense, yes they are available to user space.
<p>
The other thing which I really should have mentioned (I did in an earlier article) was that, in order to provide truly high resolution, you also need a high-resolution clock within the kernel.  Current kernels still do not have that, so the hrtimer interface still works with <tt>HZ</tt> resolution - 4ms on i386 with the default configuration.  There are a few high-resolution clock patches around, mainly tied to John Stultz's low-level clock rework; something should get merged before too long, I would think (but not for 2.6.16).

<P>
Perhaps I'm missing something, but I was always under the impression that the number of nanoseconds in a second (10<sup>9</sup>) was not actually a power of two. Even if it were, it's not 2<sup>32</sup>...

<P>
So how do we reconcile the two-32-bit-values-as-one-64-bit-value problem?  Does the nanoseconds half count up monotonically for 4.3 seconds, at which point some weird adjustment is made? (No, that would seem to be incompatible with the 64-bit view of things.) Is the "seconds" half not really seconds but actually a count of 4.3[etc.]-second intervals?  Or is the "nanoseconds" half not really nanoseconds but actually a count of 1/4.3[etc.]-nanosecond super-micro-jiffies?

<P>
Am I missing something obvious?  (I didn't get much sleep last night, so I might be...)

      There are two "models". Every architecture picks a model at build-time, and sticks to it - the model's format is compiled into the kernel, and ktime inline functions behave differently in both models.<br>
<p>
the first one is the 'scalar' model, which is used on 64-bit platforms, where the 64-bit value contains nanosec values, and if we ever get seconds values from userspace, it's converted into nanosecs.<br>
<p>
the second is the 'union' model, where the 64-bit word is split into two 32-bit fields, the upper one holds seconds, the lower one nanoseconds. ktime_t values are always in 'normalized' form: the lower 32-bit must only contain values up to 10^9. (I.e. the range 0x3b9aca00-0xffffffff is excluded from the lower 32-bits, only range 0x00000000-0x3b9ac9ff is allowed.) The 64-bit word can also be accessed as a whole, via a union field in the ktime_t structure.<br>
<p>
you might ask: what is the win opposed to having two separate 32-bit fields? Even though values always have to be normalized after operations on them (addition, subtraction), it's still beneficial to do arithmetics on the 64-bit field:<br>
<p>
     /* add 'delta' to 'ktime' */<br>
<p>
     ktime.tv64 += delta.tv64;<br>
     if (ktime.nsec &gt;= 1000000000) {<br>
         ktime.nsec -= 1000000000;<br>
         ktime.sec++;<br>
     }<br>
<p>
note that in the above op there is no division nor multiplication, and since both ktime values were normalized, only a single-step normalization is needed afterwards.<br>

      Ah, I see now--thank you.  I almost had the right idea, but I read too much into Jon's "single 64-bit value" comment.<br>

      heh, you could even use MMX or other SIMD to work on both halfs with one instruction ;-)<br>

      And floating point is unfortunately a no-go in kernelspace.<br>

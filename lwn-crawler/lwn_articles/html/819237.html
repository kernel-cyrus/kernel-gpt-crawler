<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 5, 2020</br>
           </div>
The end of April saw the posting of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1588127445.git.javier.malave@narfindustries.com/">a
complex patch set</a> called "Popcorn 
Linux distributed thread execution".  It is the first appearance on the
kernel mailing lists of an 
academic project (naturally called <a href="http://popcornlinux.org/">Popcorn
Linux</a>) that has been underway since 2013 or so.  This project has,
among other goals, the objective of turning a tightly networked set of
computers into something that looks like a single system â€” a sort of NUMA
machine with even larger than usual inter-node costs.  The posted code,
which is a portion of the larger project, is focused on process migration
and memory sharing across machines.  It is an interesting proof of concept,
but one should not expect to see it merged in anything close to its current
form. 
<p>

Each node in a Popcorn system is a separate Linux host sitting on the
network.  Popcorn itself is started by loading a kernel module that is charged
with connecting the larger system together.  The module reads a list of IP
addresses (IPv4 only) directly from a file (<tt>/etc/popcorn/nodes</tt> by
default).  Each machine will make a TCP connection to every node listed
ahead of itself in this file, then wait for an incoming connection from
every node listed afterward.  Thereafter, each node is known by an integer
ID which is simply its position in the <tt>nodes</tt> file.
<p>
There is a hard-coded maximum of 62 nodes.  No sort of authentication is
done for incoming node connections, which might seem like a bit of a
security issue; indeed, the patch set warns against running Popcorn on
machines connected to the Internet.
There does not seem to be any provision for nodes going up or down or being
absent entirely.
Comments in the patch set say that the TCP-based communication system
"<q>is intended for Popcorn testing and development purposes
only</q>", suggesting that, someday, somebody will get around to
implementing something better.
<p>
<h4>System calls</h4>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, some new system calls are needed to allow applications to
work within the larger Popcorn Linux system.  To start with, 
an application can query the set of available nodes with this new system
call: 
<p>
<pre>
    struct popcorn_node_info {
	unsigned int status;
	int arch;
	int distance;
    };

    int popcorn_get_node_info(int *my_nid, struct popcorn_node_info *nodes, int len);
</pre>
<P>

On return, <tt>my_nid</tt> will contain the ID of the node the caller is
running on, and <tt>nodes</tt>, an array of <tt>len</tt>
<tt>popcorn_node_info</tt> structs indexed by node ID,  will be filled in
with the details of the 
first <tt>len</tt> nodes (up to the number that actually exist, of
course).  The <tt>status</tt> field in each entry will be zero if the
corresponding node is offline, 
one otherwise.  The <tt>arch</tt> field will describe the node's
architecture (<tt>POPCORN_ARCH_X86</tt> in the current patch set, since x86
is the only supported architecture), and
<tt>distance</tt> is always zero.
<p>

The system call to move the current thread to another node is:
<p>
<pre>
    int popcorn_migrate(int node_id, void *uregs);
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>node_id</tt> identifies the node to which the thread should be moved,
and <tt>uregs</tt> is, for some reason, the contents of the processor
registers to be restored when the thread resumes on the new node.  The passing of the
processor registers separately might be an artifact of a Popcorn feature
that is not part of this patch set: the ability to move threads to remote
nodes with a different processor architecture.  In the posted patch set,
threads can only move themselves; the underlying code is written to allow
other processes to force a thread to move, though.
<p>
While <tt>popcorn_migrate()</tt> looks like a general facility to move
threads around, in practice it seems to be a bit more limited than that.  A
moved ("remote") thread retains a connection to its "origin" node; indeed,
the original thread is still present on 
the origin node, it is just prevented from executing while the remote
thread is running.  A remote thread can only be moved back to the origin, 
so migrating a thread between two remote nodes
would be a two-step operation, first moving it back to the origin then to
out the new node.
<p>
The current execution status of a thread can be had with the last of the
new system calls in this patch set:
<p>
<pre>
    struct popcorn_thread_status {
	int current_nid;
	int peer_nid;
	pid_t peer_pid;
    };

    int popcorn_get_thread_status(struct popcorn_thread_status *status);
</pre>
<p>

This call will fill in <tt>status</tt> with the current node ID for the
calling thread, the other node it is connected to, and its process ID on
that node.  If the thread is not currently migrated, both
<tt>current_nid</tt> and <tt>peer_nid</tt> will be the ID of the origin
node.
<p>
<h4>Supporting remote threads</h4>
<p>
Once a thread has been moved to another node, more work must be done to
keep things synchronized.  For example, if the remote thread exits, the
origin thread must be made to exit too.  A signal sent to the origin
thread must be propagated to the remote version where the work is actually
being done.  All of this is handled by intercepting various actions and
sending messages across the inter-node connections to cause the right
things to happen.  Some especially complicated code appears to be making
futexes work across machines.

<p>
Migrating a thread sets up the basic information it needs to run, but
leaves a lot of stuff behind; in particular, almost the entirety of the
thread's memory-layout information still lives on the origin node, where it
might well be shared with other threads.  It is not surprising that memory
management is the focus of some of the most complex code in the Popcorn
patch set.
<p>
The set of virtual memory areas (VMAs) describing the thread's
address-space layout will be shared with any other threads running in the
same process â€” threads that probably have not been migrated to the same
target node.  So, while the migrated thread needs to mirror that VMA
arrangement, it has little ability to change it without 
coordinating with the origin node.  For VMAs, this coordination is handled by
actually executing almost all operations at the origin.
<p>
Thus, for example, if the migrated thread calls <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>,
that call will be intercepted and shipped back to the origin for
execution.  The origin node will send back a response describing the result
of the operation; the migrated thread's memory layout will then be adjusted
to match.  Other calls, including <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/brk.2.html">brk()</a></tt> and
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
are handled in the same way.
<p>
Pages of actual memory need to be handled a bit differently, though, or
performance will suffer horribly.  Popcorn implements a protocol to allow
the ownership of pages to move between nodes, much like ownership of cache
lines can move between processors.  Read-only copies of pages can be spread
across a set of nodes, but only one node can be modifying a specific page at
any given time.  Much of the coordination is handled, once again, by the
origin node, which handles tasks like sending and receiving copies of
pages, invalidating pages on remote nodes, revoking page ownership, and
more.
<p>
The patch set also adds a new <tt>madvise()</tt> operation,
<tt>MADV_RELEASE</tt>, which explicitly releases a remote node's ownership
of a range of pages.
<p>
<h4>Will it pop soon?</h4>
<p>
There is a lot more to Popcorn Linux than what has been posted to the
list so far.  There is a mechanism to run multiple kernels on the same
machine, for example, using a modified version of the kexec mechanism.
There is a whole <a
href="http://popcornlinux.org/index.php/ft-linux">fault-tolerance
project</a> underway.  There is <a
href="http://popcornlinux.org/index.php/hexo">a mechanism</a> to offload
low-demand virtual machines to slow (but power-efficient) embedded boards,
possibly running a different processor architecture.  And more; the web
site is well-populated with academic papers describing various parts of the
system.
<p>
Popcorn Linux seems like an interesting project, so readers unfamiliar with
how kernel development works may be surprised to see that this patch set,
posted on April&nbsp;29 and which has received a fair amount of attention
on various Internet sites
since, has not seen a single response on the mailing list.  The reason for
that is relatively straightforward, though: what has been posted is a pile
of code, rather than a patch series that is intended for serious review and
consideration.  Patch&nbsp;1 introduces the system calls, for example, but
the structure definitions they rely on don't show up until Patch&nbsp;5,
and the messaging infrastructure, without which nothing works, shows up
last.  Your editor can attest that reading a patch series organized in this
way is not a simple task; many busy kernel developers are unlikely to try.
<p>
One often hears complaints that the work done in academic settings almost
never makes it into Linux; this seems paradoxical, given that the open
development process behind Linux should be a natural fit for academic
developers.  This patch set shows where the roadblocks are, though.  It
represents many years worth of work, but none of that work was directed
toward creating a patch set that is ready to be considered for merging.
<p>
To get this work even considered for upstream, the Popcorn Linux developers
will have do a number of things.  The patches will have to be reworked
into a bisectable series, where each patch stands alone and can be
considered on its own merits.  The temporary messaging system will have to
be replaced with something that is robust, secure, and fast.  Performance
benchmarks will have to be prepared, including the impact of Popcorn Linux
on systems that are not using any of its features.  Documentation is
distressingly optional in kernel development, but a few pages of
introductory material might help developers review the patches.  And so on.
<p>
Doing all of that would be a lot of work, even before one gets into the
code changes that are likely to become necessary during the review
process.  This work is expensive and is unlikely to lead to the publication
of even a single thesis or academic paper.  It is unsurprising that getting
code of this complexity upstream tends to look unappealing to academic
researchers.  So that work is rarely done.
<p>
Sadly, that seems likely to be the fate of Popcorn Linux as well, unless somebody
can come up with the funding and the motivation to make it suitable for the
decidedly non-academic Linux kernel.  Even if it is not merged, though,
Popcorn Linux may eventually inspire some energetic developer to adopt some
of its best ideas and get them upstream in some form.  There is a lot of
interesting work to be found in this project; hopefully some of it will
eventually graduate from the academic setting and onto our systems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes it is sad to see the same ideas coming back every ten years and never being merged.<br>
If you really need SSI with terabytes of RAM, this is much cheaper than buying dedicated machines from SGI or IBM. However do not expect similar level of performance, high-speed interconnect is costly.<br>

I think you're more likely to get systemd to integrate a container registry and container-orchestration capability, and to cross the streams of container security with moving a few hundred megabytes of your worker programs through your networks to where your terabytes of data are at rest. Especially if you're at the mercy of extraction costs to move data out of a cloud provider that are so big they'd would burn through your budget or kill your business.<br>
<p>
That's not to say that a single system image is wrong, but that we'd look to create such a thing in a different way in our present tooling.<br>

You do not need a SSI if your data are at rest.<br>
<p>
SSI is used for HPC task which have a working set measured in terabyte, where traditional MPI is inadequate since it require a copy of the working set on each nodes. HP will sell you SSI with 64TB of RAM.<br>

The primary claim of Popcorn Linux over those systems is that the SSI is enforced at the compiler and kernel level, not at the program level. This means (in theory at least) that the developer doesn't need to do any additional work to take advantage of the full cluster -- they develop their application using standard POSIX threads, as if it was running on a single machine, and the Popcorn Linux infrastructure does the heavy lifting to run across multiple systems.<br>
<p>
Source: I worked on this project in grad school (not on this portion of it though -- I doubt the parts I worked on will ever make it out of academia).<br>

IIRC from glancing at MOSIX and Kerrighed when the article was posted, they work in the same way, applications continue to work without changes, they just have access to and run on a big NUMA-like system.<br>

Yes they worked entirely at kernel level.<br>
They even supported automatic process migration from a CPU on one system to a CPU on another.<br>
They also supported automatic detection and dynamic addition of nodes.<br>
<p>
The technology was killed by the cost of fast interconnect and the falling cost of RAM and multicore system.<br>

The notice you linked to states that source code for OpenMosix is still available to download.  The maintainer stopped development because, he said, the project was less relevant in the age of multicore chips.<br>

There's an obvious solution to the motivation problem mentioned at the end of the article: start an academic journal whose style guide is the same as the commit messages in a patch series. Then academics can write papers that have a patch attached to each section, where the patch does what's described in the section. The journal would probably have to publish some papers where the idea was good but the implementation was too hacky, but that just means the paper is likely to get "cited" by Ingo Molnar.<br>
<p>
Joking, of course, but it does seem like academic computer science has a good standard for presenting work that's lacking a good way to connect the presentation to the actual code written in doing the research.<br>

Given the broken way that the academic system works nowadays, you'd also need to convince grant agencies that papers in this journal were worth funding the production of.  Because time spent making your work mergeable is time not spent doing things that inflate your h-index or impact factor.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, get someone with deep pockets (the LF?) to spin up a new funding agency that focuses on stuff for your journal.<br>

You just have to convince people that the industry using Linux should count for your journal like the medical research industry subscribing to a chemistry journal counts, and you'll have a top journal. Computer science is unusual in that industry largely ignores all the academic journals, so a journal that a lot of industry actually read would stand out, even if you couldn't count everyone who compiles and executes the supplementary information sections.<br>

I was actually quite surprised by the diffstat (only looked at that, not the code at all).<br>
<p>
Ignoring the added stuff in */popcorn and drivers/msg_layer (which should probably be popcorn_msg_layer) the number of lines changed is smaller than I would have expected for something like this.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 4, 2025</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2025/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
Alistair Popple started his session at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit by proclaiming that <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt>
is "<q>the ugly stepchild</q>" of the kernel's memory-management subsystem.
Ugly or not, the ability to manage memory that is attached to a peripheral
device rather than a CPU is increasingly important on current hardware.
Popple hoped to cover some of the challenges with <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> and
find ways to make the stepchild a bit more attractive, if not bring it into
the family entirely.
<p>
There are five different types of memory managed under
<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt>; for the curious, they are:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE</tt>: device-hosted memory that is not
     directly accessible by the CPU.
<li> <tt>MEMORY_DEVICE_COHERENT</tt>: memory that <i>is</i> directly
     accessible and maintains cache coherency on both the CPU and device
     sides.  CXL memory is one example of this type.
<li> <tt>MEMORY_DEVICE_FS_DAX</tt>: memory set aside for use with the <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/dax.html">DAX</a> (direct
     file access) subsystem.
<li> <tt>MEMORY_DEVICE_GENERIC</tt>: relatively normal-looking memory,
     hosted on a device, that is often used for DAX as well.
<li> <tt>MEMORY_DEVICE_PCI_P2PDMA</tt>: memory accessible on the bus
     used for direct memory transfers between devices.
</ul>
<p>
About the only thing these types have in common is that this memory is not
allocated directly by the memory-management subsystem.  Popple is most
interested in the device-private type, associated with devices like GPUs.
This memory, being controlled by the relevant driver, has a lifetime that
is tied to that of the driver.  It may be possible to map it into user
space on demand, but, since it is not normal memory, it cannot be tracked
on the kernel's least-recently-used lists.  As a result, drivers have used
the <tt>lru</tt> field of the <tt>page</tt> structure, which is destined
for eventual removal, for other purposes.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/1016132/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/AlistairPopple-sm.png" alt="[Alistair Popple]"
title="Alistair Popple" class="lthumb"></a>

Some of Popple's recent work in this area has been to improve the reference
counting of <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> pages; most types are now properly tracked
this way.  One problem, which took 32&nbsp;patches to fix, was that FS-DAX
pages had reference counts that were off by one, meaning that a reference
count of one actually meant that a page was free.  That has (as of 6.15)
been fixed, freeing a page bit in the process.
<p>
Having solved that problem, Popple is wondering what to be working on next.
He would like to support huge device-private pages; only the DAX types of
<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> pages support anything larger than base pages now.
His cleanup work should enable the use of huge pages more widely.  There
was some discussion on just how folios might be created for larger
<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> pages.  Meanwhile, Balbir Singh has posted <a
href="/ml/all/20250306044239.3874247-1-balbirs@nvidia.com/">a patch
series</a> adding transparent huge page support for device-private pages.
<p>
Currently, Popple said, drivers are using the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/include/linux/migrate.h#L192"><tt>migrate_vma</tt>
interface</a> to move data to and from device memory.  It is a simple
interface, working with arrays of page-frame numbers, but it gets
increasingly unwieldy as page sizes get larger.  He would like to enable
the splitting and merging of huge pages on migration; huge pages are often
easily available on the device side.
<p>
A bigger problem, he said, is enabling file-backed, device-private pages;
currently, those pages only work as private, anonymous memory.  It would be
nice, he said, to be able to just pass a virtual address to a device and
let it access whatever contents are there.  This "<q>sort-of works</q>" with
file-backed data on the host, but those pages cannot be migrated to the
device.  So memory has to be accessed remotely over the bus, which is
slower.  Things would work a lot better if devices could work with
file-backed pages locally.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox asked what the use case was for file-backed device-private
pages.  The answer was, inevitably, working with AI training data.
<p>
Popple continued that he is looking at letting device-private pages exist
in the page cache.  There are only a few lookup functions for the page
cache, so it should be relatively easy to create special cases for
device-private pages.  The read side is especially easy, the data can just
be reread from storage.  For anything requiring writing to shared data, the
kernel would handle a page fault, then call into the driver to put the
relevant pages back into host memory.
<p>
David Hildenbrand said that this scheme did not sound entirely crazy, and
asked how many hoops Popple was having to jump though to implement this;
Popple said there weren't that many.  As more information moves into
folios, he said, the task will get even easier in the future.
<p>
Wilcox was more dubious about the shared case.  Shared, writable mappings
are "<q>a terrible programming model</q>", he said, and the error-handling
is difficult.  "<q>What if we just don't do any of this?</q>".  To migrate
data to a device, let the device just have the copy, and mark it
accordingly on the host.  If something has to be done on the host side,
just invalidate the device's copy, he said, but do not ever let devices
write to this data.  If writes absolutely must happen, they can be done
over the bus; it will be slow, but it really just has to work.  He wondered
whether anybody writes to training data on the device side.
<p>
Josef Bacik concurred, saying that he has recently spent a lot of time
working with AI models; his opinion on allowing shared writable mappings
was: "<q>this whole thing will suck</q>".  Nobody wants to copy data into
user space, then to the device; they would much rather copy the data
directly to the device and avoid allocating host memory at all.  Managing
sharing will be difficult, he said; the implementation should be as simple
as possible, and stop at providing read-only access.
<p>
Hildenbrand suggested using the kernel's MMU notifiers to catch faults on
shared memory as a way of catching host-side write attempts.  It might be
worth the trouble he said; but perhaps it is easier to just say that the
device will not see host-side modifications.  Popple said that in such
cases it is better to invalidate pages on the device for correctness, even
if the result is slow.
<p>
Bacik closed the session with what seemed like a consensus view.  Kernel
developers want to anticipate all possible use cases, he said, but
sometimes it is better to stop with implementing what can be done
correctly.  Writing to data shared in device-private pages is not a use
case to worry about; any use case that might be proposed would have to be
"<q>pretty compelling</q>" to be considered.  Otherwise, he said, the only
reasonable course is to stick with the simpler case that can be implemented
correctly.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Device page faults are very expensive because you are stalling the device until the CPU can resolve the fault.  That makes me very surprised that they are the right choice for such a high-performance application.  Isn’t explicit async I/O from userspace faster?<br>

Userspace is mmap()ing the file. Then it's transferring ownership of the memory to the GPU. This is why we only need read support, because writable file maps are such a bad way to do I/O that people have written white papers about how much it sucks.<br>
<p>
I have no idea why they want to do it this way rather than allocate anonymous memory and use async I/O as you suggested. Maybe it's just that programmer time is expensive and they don't care about getting the last 5% of performance?<br>

There are a couple of reasons we have been looking at this. The first as willy mentions is to ease porting and make programming easier by extending the current model we have for anonymous memory. Ideally this model allows any virtual address to be passed to a GPU library regardless of how a calling application allocated it.<br>
<p>
The other reason to allow faulting is for GPU memory over subscription scenarios, where the problem set might not fit entirely within GPU memory. And in the case of clean file backed pages we can just drop these on the floor rather than have to migrate them back.<br>
<p>
In both scenarios if explicit data movement is possible it's probably quicker, but particularly for memory over subscription I believe it can be rather tricky to get right.<br>

Would O_DIRECT + io_uring + manual data movement in userspace be faster, or am I missing something?<br>

At present you would want to use driver calls to do the data movement, as they can utilise GPU DMA hardware to do the data movement. Particularly for larger data movements this is quicker than using the CPU.<br>

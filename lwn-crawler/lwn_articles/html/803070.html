The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring mechanism</a> is a relatively new
interface for asynchronous I/O; it first appeared in the 5.1 kernel in
May.  Since then, though, it has quickly grown in capabilities and in
users; now it appears that it is outgrowing some of the kernel
infrastructure that supports it.  Thus, we have a proposal from Jens Axboe
(the io_uring maintainer) for <a 
href="/ml/linux-block/20191024134439.28498-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">a new
workqueue subsystem</a> for io_uring that hints at some interesting plans
for the future.
<p>
<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/workqueue.html">Workqueues</a>
are used by many kernel subsystems to run work asynchronously in
process context.  Over the years, workqueues have been extensively tweaked
to provide the features needed by the kernel and to keep queued work
requests from running concurrently on the same processor and contending
with each other for CPU time.  They have been
relatively stable for a while, indicating that they do what is needed most
of the time.
<p>
The io_uring mechanism is all about allowing user space to create
asynchronous threads of execution, so it's not surprising that workqueues
are extensively used there.  Over time, though, some of the limitations of
workqueues have become apparent in this context.  Workqueues are, to a
great extent, about ceding control over where and when the work
functions are executed, but io_uring would benefit from a higher degree of
control over how that work is done.  Thus, the new mechanism, called
"io-wq".
<p>
One of the new workqueues (an "<tt>io_wq</tt>") is created with:
<p>
<pre>
    struct io_wq *io_wq_create(unsigned concurrency, struct mm_struct *mm);
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>concurrency</tt> is the maximum number of worker threads that can
be running on any given NUMA node, and <tt>mm</tt> is the memory-management
context associated with this queue.  In io_uring, one of these workqueues
will be created for each <tt>io_uring_setup()</tt> call, and <tt>mm</tt>
will point to the calling process's <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure.
Associating the <tt>mm_struct</tt> with the <tt>io_wq</tt> in this way
makes a number of the memory-management issues easier; the existing
workqueue mechanism does not maintain this association, even when private
workqueues are created.
<p>
The <tt>io_wq</tt> may be destroyed by passing it to <tt>io_wq_destroy()</tt>.
<p>
To defer work to an <tt>io_wq</tt>, one starts by filling out one of these
structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct io_wq_work {
	struct list_head list;
	void (*func)(struct io_wq_work **);
	unsigned flags;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The main thing to do is to set <tt>func</tt> to the function that should be
called to actually do the work; <tt>flags</tt> should be set to zero.  The
item can then be queued with either of:
<p>
<pre>
    void io_wq_enqueue(struct io_wq *wq, struct io_wq_work *work);
    void io_wq_enqueue_hashed(struct io_wq *wq, struct io_wq_work *work, 
			      void *val);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>io_wq_enqueue()</tt> adds the <tt>work</tt> to the queue for
future execution.  The <tt>io_wq_enqueue_hashed()</tt> variant, instead, is
one of the reasons for the creation of new mechanism; it guarantees that no
two jobs enqueued with the same <tt>val</tt> will run concurrently.  If an
application submits multiple buffered I/O requests for a single file, they
should not be run concurrently or they are likely to just block each other
via lock contention.  Buffered I/O on different files can and should run
concurrently, though.  "Hashed" work entries make it easy for io_uring to
manage that concurrency in an optimal way.
<p>
Passing an <tt>io_wq</tt> to <tt>io_wq_flush()</tt> will cause the calling
thread to block until all pending work items have left the queue.  Note
that this does <i>not</i> mean that those items have completed, only that
they have started.
<p>
Cancellation is another motivation for io-wq.  The io_uring mechanism has
to allow user space to cancel pending requests, meaning that it must be
possible to cancel io-wq work requests in a predictable way.  In current
kernels, cancellation of requests on network sockets can occasionally lead
to deadlocks; users tend to find this kind of behavior less amusing than
one might think, so a better solution is needed.  The new cancellation
functions are:
<p>
<pre>
    void io_wq_cancel_all(struct io_wq *wq);
    enum io_wq_cancel io_wq_cancel_work(struct io_wq *wq,
    					struct io_wq_work *cwork);
</pre>
<p>
A call to the first function will cancel all outstanding operations on the
given <tt>io_wq</tt>; the second one will cancel only the specified work
request.  Either way, this is done by sending a <tt>SIGINT</tt> signal to
each running worker thread; the function will return after the signals have
been sent without waiting for the worker threads to respond.  For
<tt>io_wq_cancel_work()</tt>, the return value will be
<tt>IO_WQ_CANCEL_OK</tt> (the request was canceled before starting),
<tt>IO_WQ_CANCEL_RUNNING</tt> (the request was running and the signal was
sent), or <tt>IO_WQ_CANCEL_NOTFOUND</tt> (the request wasn't found, meaning
it had already completed).
<p>
That is about it for the io-wq API.  It is not clear that there would be
benefits for any other kernel subsystem to move to this mechanism, so
io_uring may remain the only user for some time.  An improved io_uring will
be enough for many users to celebrate, though.
<p>
That said, there may be more coming.  Long-time LWN readers may remember a
series of discussions in 2007 for an in-kernel mechanism called, at times,
<a href="/Articles/219954/">fibrils</a>,
<a href="/Articles/223899/">threadlets</a>, or
<a href="/Articles/236206/">syslets</a>.  Regardless of the name, this
mechanism was intended to
improve asynchronous I/O support, but there was another motive as well: to
allow user space to run <i>any</i> system call asynchronously.  None of
those mechanisms reached a point of being seriously considered for merging,
but it seems that they were not forgotten.  In <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20191024134439.28498-3-axboe@kernel.dk/">patch
two</a> of the series, Axboe notes that using io-wq in io_uring "<q>gets
us one step closer to adding async support for any system call</q>".  It
thus seems that we can expect io_uring to develop the capabilities that
were envisioned almost 13&nbsp;years ago.  Stay tuned for further
developments.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Does this mean you can't issue multiple reads from the same file and have them run concurrently? That would be sad.<br>

It looks like that is just for buffered ops. Which seems reasonable, most applications that would want such an interface are likely playing with the DIO power tools anyways.<br>

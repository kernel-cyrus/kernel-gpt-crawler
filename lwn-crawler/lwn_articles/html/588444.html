           <p>This article was contributed by <a href="http://man7.org/">Michael Kerrisk</a>.</p>
           </div>
<p>
As noted by various commenters on our earlier article,
"<a href="/Articles/585415/">Flags as a system call API design
pattern</a>", there is an important step that is required when
equipping a system call with a <tt>flags</tt> argument.  If the kernel does
not take care to return an error if unknown flags are set, it is setting
the stage for a number of compatibility problems in the future.
Unfortunately, the history of Linux (and Unix) system call development
shows that this lesson has been hard to learn.
<p>

In particular, a system call flags argument
(or indeed any input structure argument that has a bit-flags field)
should always include a check of the following form in its
implementation:
<p>	  
<pre>
	if (flags &amp; ~(FL_XXX | FL_YYY))
	    return -EINVAL;
</pre>
	
<p>
Here, <tt>FL_XXX</tt> and <tt>FL_YYY</tt> form the hypothetical 
set of flags that the system call understands,
and the effect of this check is to deliver an error when the caller
specifies any bit value other than one in the set.


Checks like this future-proof the API against the day when the system
call understands additional flags. Suppose that the system call
adds a new flag, <tt>FL_ZZZ</tt>, and adjusts its check to:
	 
<pre>
	if (flags &amp; ~(FL_XXX | FL_YYY | FL_ZZZ))
	    return -EINVAL;
</pre>

<p>
A user-space application is now able to check whether it is running on
a kernel where the system call supports <tt>FL_ZZZ</tt> by checking
for an <tt>EINVAL</tt> error when making the system call. This allows
the application to flexibly deal with system call differences across
kernel versions.
	   
<p>
Although implementing <tt>flags</tt> checks such as the above inside
the kernel might seem simple and obvious, it turns out that dozens of
system calls <i>don't</i> make this check, including
<tt>clock_nanosleep()</tt>,
<tt>clone()</tt>,
<tt>epoll_ctl()</tt>,
<tt>fcntl(F_SETFL)</tt>,
<tt>mmap()</tt>, 
<tt>msgrcv()</tt>, 
<tt>msgsnd()</tt>, 
<tt>open()</tt>,
<tt>recv()</tt>, <tt>send()</tt>, 
<tt>sigaction()</tt>,
<tt>splice()</tt>,
<tt>unshare()</tt>, and many others.
		
<p>
Most of those system calls have been around for several
years.  In more recent times, most new system calls that have
a <tt>flags</tt> argument include the required check.  However, such
checks are missing even in a few system calls added in recent kernel
versions, such as as
<tt>open_by_handle_at()</tt> (2.6.39), 
<tt>recvmmsg()</tt> (2.6.33), and
<tt>sendmmsg()</tt> (3.0).
In each of those recent cases, the implementer was presumably emulating
the lack of checking that was done in the corresponding earlier system
call (<tt>open()</tt>, 
<tt>recv()</tt>,
<tt>send()</tt>). However, the failure to add the checks represents a
missed opportunity to improve on the original API.
					 
<p>
For each of the system calls that lack a check on the <tt>flags</tt>
argument, user-space applications have no easy way of detecting what
API flags a particular kernel version supports. Furthermore, failure
to implement such checks in the kernel can also complicate the lives
of kernel developers, as a couple of examples demonstrate.
				
<p>
When the kernel fails to check that only valid bits are passed
in <tt>flags</tt>, user-space applications can, with impunity, place
random garbage in the "unused" bits of <tt>flags</tt>. If a kernel
developer then decides to make use of one of the hitherto unused bits,
this may lead to surprising breakage in user-space applications, which
in turn may require the kernel developer to write suboptimal
implementations of new user-space API
features. <a href="/Articles/520198/#EPOLLWAKEUP">One recent
example</a> of this was in the implementation of
the <tt>EPOLLWAKEUP</tt> flag, where avoiding user-space breakage
meant that the kernel silently ignored this flag if the caller did not
have the <tt>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND</tt> capability. Ideally, of course,
the kernel would have informed the caller by returning an error from
the call. Consequently, applications that want to be absolutely sure
that the call will succeed must explicitly check beforehand that they
have the <tt>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND</tt> capability.
	
<p>
An even more recent example was in the implementation of the
<tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> flag for <tt>open()</tt>, where the flag
definition <a href="/Articles/558940/">incorporated
the <tt>O_DIRECTORY</tt> flag</a>, with the goal that older kernels
that do not support <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> would give an error if the flag
was specified in a call to <tt>open()</tt>.  This was necessary,
because applications that create temporary files are often security
conscious, and need to know whether their requests to create hidden
temporary files have been honored. Without this fix,
the <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> flag would be silently ignored on older
kernels,
and <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/75969/focus=76261">an
application might end up creating a visible file</a>. An unpleasant
side effect of that implementation is that user-space
applications <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html#BUGS">must
check for two different errors</a> from <tt>open()</tt> in order to
determine whether they are running on a kernel that doesn't
support <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt>.

<p>
Finally, it is worth mentioning that a few system calls have
added the required <tt>flags</tt> check <i>after</i> the call was
first implemented. Two examples are the ancient system calls
<tt>umount2()</tt> (check added in Linux 2.6.34) and
<tt>swapon()</tt> (check added in Linux 3.4). In addition, the
<tt>mremap()</tt> call, which first appeared in Linux 2.0, added the
check in Linux 2.4, and the <tt>timerfd_settime()</tt> system call,
which first appeared in Linux 2.6.25, added the check in Linux 2.6.29.
	  
<p>
However, the addition of <tt>flags</tt> checks to these system calls
represents an exception to the general rule that such checks cannot be
added after the fact, because doing so would break existing
applications that happen to pass random garbage in the "unused" bits
of <tt>flags</tt>.  With <tt>umount2()</tt> and <tt>swapon()</tt>, the
change was possible presumably because there are few users of these
system calls other than the <tt>mount</tt> and <tt>swapon</tt>
commands, and those programs could be modified if the kernel change
caused them to break. In the case of <tt>timerfd_settime()</tt>, the
change was made soon after the initial implementation, when there were
likely to have been few users of the interface. And in the case
of <tt>mremap()</tt>, the change was made at the time of a major
kernel version change (from 2.2 to 2.4), when such ABI changes were
occasionally permitted; with the contemporary 10-week release cycle, such changes
are not permitted. 
<p>
Thus if the check on
unused flag bits is not included in the initial implementation, it is
often impossible to add it later.  The clear conclusion is that any
addition of flag bits to a system call should come with the proper checks
from the outset.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Add a new system call api_level().  By default the level is 0.  Any extra flags passed to clone() will be quietly ignored.  If the process sets api_level(1) then strict checking is enabled on the flags.<br>
<p>
When a new flag is added to clone() it can continue to be ignored with api_level 0 and only have effect with 1 and above.<br>
<p>
I imagine that the standard C library would call api_level as soon as the process is created.<br>

This sounds like an api_level() global to the process. There's a big problem with that: You can't link different code using different api_levels into one program, unless you want to call api_level() before every syscall (and properly protect it in multithreaded programs) which sounds quite impractical.<br>
<p>
Linked libraries would be the obvious biggest problem. Also, if you want to use a new flag for one syscall in your program and have to raise api_level for that, you'd have to audit the complete source for any syscalls incompatible with that api_level.<br>

You're right, it would be for the whole process.  Better than nothing, I think.  I don't agree that you would always have to 'audit the complete source' because most access to the kernel goes through the standard C library, which will perform its own validation or scrubbing on flags.  The upgrade to api_level would be by upgrading to a newer version of libc.  It is common for systems to have older libcs available to support older binaries.<br>

If the syscall has at least one pointer parameter, there is an easy fix: use the top bit of the pointer as a "validate flags" flag. Older kernels will return an error ("wtf are you trying to do with a kernel pointer, userspace program?"). Newer kernels will mask it and carry on.<br>

Can't do this only for the OS: having access to the top bit of a pointers (on 64bit address spaces) would be very useful for garbage collectors which could then record efficiently which pointers they have visited or not.<br>
<p>
That's said, it's still possible: two bits for the GC(in case one isn't enough), two bits for the 'OS compatibility' (in case one isn't enough), it remains 60-bit for the real address which is more than enough.<br>

      <p>Whatever bits the userspace program is using for GC or other tagging already have to be masked out before passing the pointer to the kernel, so it does not matter if the same bits are used for userspace tags and system call flags. They won't conflict.</p>

<p>That said, I stand by my proposal being a joke (though my jokes being taken seriously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Skip_to_talk#A_confession">has happened before</a>). It only works if the address space is split right in the middle; it would work for x86-64 and for 32-bit architectures with a 2G/2G split, but would not work for 32-bit architectures with a 3G/1G split, where there are valid userspace pointers with the high bit set.

      <P>We had exactly this problem on Solaris. David J. Brown of spec-1170 fame went through and removed all the edge-cases from our implementation, over a number of years.

<P>We offered a "next version" guarantee and provided a tool, "appcert".  If your program passed appcert but didn't run on the next release of Solaris, it was Sun's fault and we were on the hook to fix it.  Think of it as "validate once, run forever"

<P>Mostly, people failed appcert, but a few passed and blew up, thus exposing new bugs for us <I>before</I> they shipped their product.

<P>Linux could do something similar: announce an addition is coming in the next release and ship a test tool to detect breakage. Obviously one would also ship another optional tool to let a broken app keep running (;-))

<P>In the specific case of flags, it's easy to write an interposer (interceptor) that checks the flags. Easy, in this case, was on the 
order of 30 seconds ...

<PRE>
$cat open.c
/*
 * open -- intercept calls to open to catch flag errors
 * Generated by mkinterposer from a template by David Collier-Brown.

#define MASK 0xDEADBEEF

#include &lt;link.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;	/* For assert() macro. */
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;	/* For open(). */
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;	/* For open(). */
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;	/* For open(). */
/*
 * open -- intercept open
 */
int open(const char *pathname, int flags) {
        int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode) {
	static void *actual = NULL;

	if (actual == NULL) {
		actual = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "open");
		assert(actual != NULL);
	}
	assert((flags &amp; MASK) == 0);
	return ((int (*)(const char *, int))actual)(pathname, flags);
}
</PRE>

<P>The same kind of interposer can be used to fix the flags, for people who don't have the source code for a buggy program they still want to run.

<P>If anyone wants the mkinterposer script or a complete set of interposers, send me mail.

Perhaps strace(1) would be a good starting point?  As a side benefit it would at least update strace with knowledge of all valid flags and system calls.<br>

We prototyped this sort of thing using strace (truss, actually: it was Solaris) but that's an intrusive, heavyweight program and not suitable for production. It's also a lot of work!  <br>
<p>
Adding a library and one more call/return is harmless, and can be added to a regression-test suite with LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/intrerposer.so.1 <br>
<p>
As it happens, we fell in love with shared libraries and built several tools, including apptrace, a standard-library strace equivalent, a shared library profiler and a transaction performance monitor, all lightweight and non-crash-inducing.<br>

I'll also point out the example of the ecn flag bit in TCP. It was marked as 'reserved' for years, so suitably paranoid firewalls either dropped packets with it, or zeroed it out. This caused grief when the bit was redefined to mean something new and large portions of the Internet couldn't use it.<br>
<p>
In this case, I think the firewalls were doing the right thing. they didn't know what this bit meant and so had no idea what the effect of allowing it would be.<br>

You need to think of this sort of situation when you talk about how to handl unknown flags.<br>

(Just as background for others, and to make sure that we're talking about the same thing, I presume we are talking about this: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3360#section-3">http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3360#section-3</a> ) <br>
<p>
Someone else also mentioned this example to me. I haven't thought about it at length, but it seems to me that this case is different in kind. The problem there is that *a third party* is mediating the conversation between two end-points. In that case, things get more tricky. But, the case of a direct two-party user-space-to-kernel conversation is simpler, and I think the "check for invalid flags" rule always applies.<br>

You are correct, but we are getting to the point where there are also 'third party' security tools trying to mediate between userspace and the kernel (seccomp, SELinux policies, etc) so the comparison isn't as dissimilar as it may seem at first glance.<br>

I see where you're going (I think), but I don't think it changes things from the perspective of kernel system call service routine, which should still do the EINVAL flags check. However, different rules may be needed for intermediaries that you refer to.<br>

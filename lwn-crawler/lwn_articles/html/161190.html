It's <a href="/Articles/161192/">official</a>: the third edition of
<i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i>, by Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati,
is out.  Your editor was pleased to receive a copy of this 900-page
monster, delivered by a company which specializes in other sorts of heavy
loads, such as pianos.  UTLK&nbsp;3 was some time in coming, but it is a
welcome arrival.
<p>

As one would expect, this version of UTLK covers the 2.6 kernel.  Your
editor would like to point out to kernel-oriented publishers, however, that
simply saying "2.6" is not particularly informative.  A wide variety of
kernels have come out under the 2.6 name.  Readers will want to know
<i>which</i> 2.6 kernel is covered by a given book, and they would rather
not have to dig for that information.  As it turns out, the reader who gets
far enough into the introduction will discover that UTLK&nbsp;3 was written
for the 2.6.11 kernel.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/161199/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/utlk-figure-sm.png"

align="left"></a> 
This version of the book, like its predecessor, is big on details, and is
very firmly tied to the i386 architecture.  So, after a brief (and, in your
editor's opinion, not entirely necessary) introduction to how Unix-like
systems work, the book delves directly into i386 segmentation registers,
global descriptor tables, and related details.  Many of the key control
paths in the kernel are described, step by step; often, the book includes
flow charts, like the example on the left (which describes the page fault
handling algorithm).  The level of detail sometimes makes it hard to get a
sense for the big picture, but it <i>does</i> help somebody trying to
figure out how a particular function works.
<p>

Indeed, that is perhaps the key feature which differentiates this book.  It
is very much a "how it works" book, designed to help people understand the
code.  It is not, however, a "how to hack it" book like <i>Linux Device
Drivers</i> or <i>Linux Kernel Development</i>.  It presents kernel
functions and data structures, steps the reader through them, but does not,
for example, emphasize the rules for using them.  UTLK is a study guide,
not a programming manual.
<p>

But it is an effective and useful study guide.  It covers a wide range of
topics, including memory management, process management, scheduling,
signals, the virtual filesystem, timing, the I/O layers, and more.  Even
with its weight, this book cannot cover everything, however; omitted topics
include networking, security (security modules, key management, etc.),
specific device drivers, sound, video, the kernel build system, and all of
the other architectures supported by Linux.  (For what it's worth, O'Reilly
is said to have an "understanding the Linux network stack" book in the
works now).
<p>

Certainly, there are things your editor would have done differently.  There
are some minor technical glitches; for example, the book claims that
acquiring a semaphore always involves putting the acquiring process to
sleep first, which is very much not the case.  The discussion of sleeping
starts with <tt>sleep_on()</tt>, and only later mentions that
<tt>sleep_on()</tt> is not a recommended interface.  The discussion of some
interesting topics (direct I/O, for example) is overly short.  But, as a
whole, the book is excellent, and the kernel function index at the end
helps to make it a useful reference.  There is a space on your editor's "L1
bookshelf" (the one reachable without moving the chair) for UTLK&nbsp;3.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I was wondering what other Linux-related books people have on their L1<br>
bookshelf.  The last time I had my hands in kernel guts was around<br>
2.1.126, I'd like to start tinkering again and it would be useful to<br>
have something that could get me up to speed with the current kernel.<br>

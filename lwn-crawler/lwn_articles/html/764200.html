<p>Network packet headers contain a great deal of information, but the
kernel often only needs a subset of that information to be able to perform
filtering or associate any given packet with a flow. The piece of code that
follows the different layers of packet encapsulation to find the important
data is called a flow dissector. In current Linux kernels, the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.6/source/net/core/flow_dissector.c">flow
dissector</a>
is written in C. A <a href="/Articles/763938/">patch set</a> has been
proposed recently to implement it in BPF with the clear goal of improving
security, flexibility, and maybe even performance.</p>

<h4>Flow dissection in the kernel</h4>

<p>Flow dissector usage is common in high-speed networks, but it is not limited
to that use case. Information from the flow dissector may be used
by a firewall or a traffic filter, or in any other situation where complete
packet parsing is not necessary. For example, just the source IP address or UDP
port number may be enough for the kernel to decide on the action to
perform on a packet.  The flow dissector extracts just
the values the caller has requested from the headers; those values are
called "keys". The Linux implementation of the flow dissector is not
the only one; Wireshark, for example, has its own version of <a
href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChapterDissection.html">packet
dissection</a>.</p>

<p>Let us show packet dissection on an example of extracting fields from a
UDP packet; in this case, it has been asked to extract two keys: the IP
addresses and the UDP port numbers.  The dissector starts at the Ethernet
layer to check whether 
the packet contains an IP header directly or if there are VLANs or other
encapsulations to deal with. At the IP level it will save the source and
destination addresses, along with the protocol field, which determines
the type of the payload protocol. Assuming that the protocol is UDP, the
dissector will look for the source and destination port fields,
respectively, and save their values. At that point, the requested keys have
been found and the dissector's work is done.  Note that the real dissector
will be more complicated; it will also follow other encapsulation cases
(if the UDP header does not directly follow the IP header, for example),
take into account the 
packet fragmentation, and possibly save more keys.</p>

<p>Linux currently includes one built-in flow dissector; the <a
href="https://www.netdevconf.org/2.2/papers/horman-tcflower-talk.pdf">flower
classifier [PDF]</a> is the main user. The idea of using a flow dissector
based on BPF was <a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/netconf2017_files/rx_hardening_and_udp_gso.pdf">raised
back in 2017 [PDF]</a>. Petar Penkov and Willem de Bruijn have recently
proposed to add a
flow dissector written in BPF for the receive path.</p>

<h4>Switching to BPF</h4>

<p>Using BPF for flow dissection adds a number of interesting security
features. Certain types of vulnerabilities become impossible because BPF
programs are 
guaranteed to terminate and thus won't go into an infinite loop.
The submission mentioned <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4348">CVE-2013-4348</a>
as an illustration of the type of problem that can be avoided.
That vulnerability consisted of the flow dissector entering an
infinite loop when using IPIP encapsulation in cases where it received a
packet with a tiny header length value.</p>

<p>Additionally, in BPF, all memory accesses are checked, so it is
not possible for a program to read outside of the packet bounds. Another
possible feature of the new flow dissector is allowing the administrator to
disable the dissection of packets containing unused protocols,
reducing the number of possible attacks. If a bug is discovered, the
administrator can remove the faulty code from the dissector without a
kernel recompilation or even a reboot. Or, they can add their own specialty
dissector if needed.</p>

<p>The proposed patch adds the BPF execution in
<tt>__skb_flow_dissect()</tt>; each network namespace can have its own
dissector.  The submission includes an <a
href="/ml/netdev/20180830182301.89435-3-peterpenkov96@gmail.com/">example
program</a> to illustrate the concept. It already handles most of the
protocols needed, including multiple levels of IP encapsulation, VLAN, and
IPv4/v6 extension headers.</p>

<p>The possible return values of the BPF flow dissector were the subject of a
discussion. Currently the program returns <tt>BPF_OK</tt> (if dissection
has completed successfully) or <tt>BPF_DROP</tt> (if the dissector came to
a conclusion that it is necessary to drop the packet). Song Liu <a
href="/ml/netdev/CAPhsuW5pOYdTx+w06=xW0XMPkjx62RsJ2EP5iJZCx_3QQZb=xw@mail.gmail.com/">asked</a>
if there should be a separate value to allow fallback to the C
implementation if the BPF program encounters a protocol it does not
support. Penkov <a
href="/ml/netdev/CAG4SDVVS1Akdg7hkFwkencBk_rZL5zGRYREHtAiK3+Cg=oL3pw@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>
that fallback to C would defeat the security guarantees provided by
BPF.  De Bruijn <a 
href="/ml/netdev/CAF=yD-KciJUH6Mi_oE2rqfOPWTLvEAdinos64fL=0+dEA=_gFQ@mail.gmail.com/">explained
further</a> that this idea had been discussed, but they had decided
against it. The goal of the BPF flow dissector is to replace the built-in
version; falling back to the C dissector would make reaching this goal harder
because users would quickly come to depend on this behavior.</p>

<p>The location of the hook for the BPF program was also discussed. It
would be possible to add it to the XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook instead,
for example. The authors of the proposal did not go that way for
multiple reasons. The first reason is that it would be more expensive
&mdash; the XDP hook executes before <a href="/Articles/358910/">GRO</a>
(generic receive offload), so the dissector would run more often. The XDP
hook also runs before the SKB structure to hold the packet is allocated,
and there is no easy way to move
the dissected keys to the SKB afterwards. It could be possible to
implement both flow dissection and GRO in a single pass, but that would
require much more flow state to work.

<p>In the first version of the submission, the definitions of the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.6/source/include/net/flow_dissector.h">various
structures</a> used to hold flow-dissector keys were copied into the BPF
program itself, since they are otherwise not visible to user space. Alexei
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/netdev/20180820205205.jj7e75pulwqkorpr@ast-mbp/">noted</a> that
everything used by a BPF program becomes part of the user-space API; he
suggested three solutions: moving all the key structures to the user-space
headers, wrapping all of them into a separate structure and modifying the
code when the internal ones change, or waiting for <a
href="/Articles/750695/">BTF</a> to solve the issue. The last option was
eliminated since BTF is not ready for this kind of use yet. As networking
maintainer  David Miller
also <a
href="/ml/netdev/20180820.192446.1163576988616844281.davem@davemloft.net/">supported</a>
the wrapping option, this is the solution the second
submission used: <tt>struct bpf_flow_keys</tt> contains all of the
supported keys
so that they are available to the BPF program.</p>

<p>
The first version of this patch set ran into an interesting problem: since
the offset at which to start dissection in a packet is supplied by the
caller, the BPF verifier cannot ensure that accesses using that offset will
remain within bounds.  So relatively slow accessors had to be used to get
at packet data.  Daniel Borkmann <a
href="/ml/netdev/3551c6f1-61d4-6f2d-885f-9f84131179e9@iogearbox.net/">suggested</a>
a simple trick to get around this issue: the BPF program need only check
that the offset is in bounds at the beginning; after that, the verifier can
prove that subsequent uses will remain within bounds.  That change 
<a
href="/ml/netdev/CAG4SDVXU8kT_ZX17GkZb8BVBEHGRSR9vBe+jE_EavkBzjOeECQ@mail.gmail.com/">improved
the performance</a> of BPF dissectors to be comparable with the in-kernel
dissector.

<h4>Current state</h4>

<p>
A performance evaluation is
included with the submission; it compares the BPF flow dissector with
the in-kernel dissector and the no-op dissector on a UDP flow.
The speed of the dissectors is similar, with
the BPF one performing slightly better than the in-kernel dissector. More
evaluations will probably
follow, but the results are already encouraging.</p>

<p>The BPF flow dissector already integrates with the flower classifier since it
uses the same interface. The tests included with the patch set show this
integration: the demonstration drops packets from a specified UDP source
port in the scenario we covered at the beginning of the article. As
flower uses the flow dissector to match flows, dropping the right ones shows
the right dissection.</p>

<p>The BPF flow dissector is another part of an increasingly BPF-based
network processing model that includes
XDP (<a href="/Articles/750845/">covered here</a> previously).  The
goal of the BPF flow dissector is ambitious: to replace the built-in
one. Time will tell if it will succeed.  Before that,
the patch set received positive comments and it seems likely that it will be
included in the near future.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      As long as it's <em>compiled</em> to similar machine code (iirc, ebpf is compiled on load) then there's no reason it shouldn't run at a similar speed, is there?

Years of work on C compilers makes them pretty good both at higher level transformations and low level machine specific optimisation.<br>
<p>
I'd be surprised if this could easily be beaten or quickly replicated by the eBPF compiler.<br>
<p>
The only case I see BPF winning is if the BPF program is produced and compiled specifically for the task in hand and thus omits a lot of option checking and branches that are not used in the specific dissector.  This could well be what's happening here.<br>

The nature of the BPF instruction set and virtual machine also makes it easier for a compiler to elide rote conditionals and branches, such as related to bounds checking, regardless of the scope and SLoC of the policy logic. This can be accomplished in C, but the language and environment have many more degrees of freedom so it requires careful and deliberate use of data structures[1] and composition[2] such that the compiler can readily ascertain and prove the variants through complex conditionals, type conversions, and deep call chains. Such careful design is normally lacking in typical C software stacks, including Linux kernel networking code, and its one of those aspects of programming (like good error handling, OOM recovery, or concurrency modeling) that demands strict discipline across the code base from the very outset.<br>
<p>
A BPF compiler should have an easier time optimizing data access because of the stricter invariants baked into the design; and because these invariants demand greater discipline from the outset. C compilers are super sophisticated and the eBPF compiler quite naive, but we overestimate the ease of proving constraints in general purpose code and underestimate the dividends from code underpinned by strong, natural invariants.<br>
<p>
I think this is one aspect of BPF that indisputably gives it a leg up, notwithstanding the abusive use of BPF. I've been critical of the shift to using BPF and eBPF as a green field for reinventing subsystems that are more maintainable and transparent using the normal C kernel interfaces and architecture. From a functional perspective I'm suspicious of heavy BPF usage, but I can't deny the technical potential.<br>
<p>
[1] For example, using fixed-sized arrays...<br>
[2] ...and passing them in a way that access bounds remain easily statically provable despite C's pointer decay semantics. (E.g. keep pointer derivations in lexically close proximity to parameter declarations and variable definitions containing the array.) Relying on the compiler to hoist bounds checking out of loops has proven spotty at best. Like JIT optimizations and performance claims, it's theoretically workable but difficult for compilers to resolve consistently. Plus, such hoisting can be done more reliably in something like BPF because there are more invariants enforced from the outset.<br>

I don't know BPF at all, but I can support the idea that it is remarkably difficult to prove constraints in C.<br>
<p>
In general, in high performance computing situations, one reason Fortran is sometimes preferred is that it does not have pointers (in practical terms - they do exist but are very little used).  A pointer in C can point *anywhere*, so unless the compiler can trace its entire lifecycle, they can make lots of otherwise relatively straightforward optimizations very hard.  Pointers can also point in to the middle of what you'd like to have as unitary data types, again preventing certain optimizations.  So in general, Fortran code is more easily optimized than C.  (There are modified dialects of C that implement some additional constraints for this same reason (C11 has some effort in this direction, I believe).)<br>
<p>
That specific example might not apply here, but is hopefully interesting.<br>

Indeed, it has often been said, and it is logically true, that higher level languages with stronger typing and more descriptive constructs should allow for better compiler optimisation and faster execution.<br>
<p>
Often that's not the case as code can be a mess in any language- and though this may also be a situation where the C is aged and not well optimised.<br>
<p>
The security benefits of eBPF make this initiative a good thing though.  And if anything, further use of eBPF should help drive optimisation efforts in the compiler/assembler.<br>

I've heard these sorts of defenses of jitted code over and over again for 30 years. Please forgive me for being dubious as to any advantages in real world applications on anything other than toy benchmarks.<br>

Java, a JITted runtime, actually is pretty fast. What drags it down in real world workloads is garbage collection pauses. There are techniques that avoid allocation, and thus the GC, but barely anyone uses them.<br>
<p>
And the Graal compiler available in newer OpenJDK promises to show what a JIT is really capable of, because the current compiler is so old and complex that progress in it ceased a long time ago. Early adopters of Graal report even 20% improvements, if I remember correctly.<br>

      <br>&gt; [1] For example, using fixed-sized arrays...
<br>&gt; [2] ...and passing them in a way that access bounds remain easily statically provable despite C's pointer decay semantics.

Found this posting by Walter Bright from 2009. Too bad no C compiler has implemented something like it (AFAIK):

Higher level transformations can still be done when compiling to eBPF, since they are done before instruction selection. So LLVM does the first round of optimization and emits eBPF, while the kernel does bytecode verification and x86 instruction selection. Where a regular compiler has an edge is in register allocation and target-dependent loop optimizations (optimizing induction variables, choosing addressing modes, etc.).<br>

Are loops permitted in eBPF now? I mean, there's no reason loops that the verifier can prove terminate might not exist in eBPF, but last I knew they were still prohibited (in check_cfg()). (... I just checked, and that's still true in master, and in -next.)<br>
<p>
In the absence of loops I don't see that target-dependent loop optimizations are going to be particularly relevant (except, I suppose, for complete unrolling.)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Years of work on C compilers makes them pretty good both at higher level transformations and low level machine specific optimisation.</font><br>
<p>
A C compiler is like a cow. It's big and complex (how many stomachs?) because it has to be if it wants to stand a chance extracting anything of value from the extremely low quality food it takes.<br>
<p>
Assembler, on the other hand, is like a dog. It's much simpler because transition from meat to meat is kind of easy.<br>
<p>
But C? Nope. It has to work *hard*.<br>

"Linux currently includes one built-in flow dissector; the flower classifier [PDF] is the main user." It's one user but /not/ the main one. Calculating the skb-&gt;hash is done using the flow dissector and this is done for every packet in the stack, and its something that cannot be compiled out, hence the target to reduce attack surface there.<br>

Those who read the linux-kernel mailing list will, over time, develop an
ability to recognize certain types of discussions by the pattern of the
thread.  One of those types must certainly be "lone participant
persistently argues that the entire kernel community is doing it wrong."
Such discussions can often be a good source for inflammatory quotes, but
they often lack much in the way of redeeming value otherwise.  <a
href="/Articles/492677/">This thread</a> on the rules for merging patches
into stable releases would seem to fit the pattern, but a couple of the
points discussed there may be worthy of highlighting.  If nothing else,
perhaps a repeat of that discussion can be avoided in the future.
<p>
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=c1afdaff90538ef085b756454f12b29575411214">This
patch</a> to the ath9k wireless driver was meant to fix a simple bug; it
was merged for 3.4. Since it was a bug fix, it was duly marked for
the stable updates and shipped in 3.3.1.  It turns out to not have been
such a good idea, though; some 3.3.1 users have reported that the "fix" can
break the driver and sometimes make the system as a whole unusable.  That
is not the sort of improvement that stable kernel users are generally
hoping for.  Naturally, they hoped to receive a fix to the fix as soon as
possible.
<p>
When the 3.3.2 update went into the review process without a revert for the
offending commit, some users asked why.  The answer was simple: the rules
for the stable tree do not allow the inclusion of any patch that has not
already been merged, in some form, into the mainline.  Since this
particular fix had not yet made it to Linus (it was still in the wireless
tree), Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable kernel maintainer, declined to take
it for the 3.3.2 cycle.  And that is where the trouble started.
<p>
Our lone participant (Felipe Contreras) denounced this decision as a
triumph of bureaucratic rules over the need to actually deliver working
kernels to users.  Beyond that, he said, since reverting the broken patch
simply restored the relevant code to its form in the 3.3 release, the code
was, in effect, already upstream.  Accepting the revert, he said, would have
the same effect as dropping the bad patch before 3.3.1 was released.  In
this view, refusing to accept the fix made little sense.  
<p>
Several kernel developers tried to convince him otherwise using arguments
based on the
experience gained from many years of kernel maintenance.  They do not
appear to have succeeded.  But they did clearly express a couple of points
that are worth repeating; even if one does not agree with them, they
explain why certain things are done the way they are.
<p>
The first of those was that experience has proved, all too many times, that
fixes applied only to stable kernel releases can easily go astray before
getting into the mainline.  So problems that get fixed in a stable release
may not be fixed in current development kernels - which are the base for
future stable kernels.  So stable kernel users may see a problem addressed,
only to have it reappear when they upgrade to a new stable series.
Needless to say, that, too, is not the experience stable kernel users are
after.  On the other hand, people who like to search for security holes can
learn a lot by watching for fixes that don't make it into the mainline.
<p>
It is true that dropped patches used to be a far bigger problem than they are now.  A patch
applied to, say, a 2.2 release had no obvious path into the 2.3 development
series; such patches often fell on the floor despite the efforts of
developers who were specifically trying to prevent such occurrences.  In
the current development model, a fix that makes it into a subsystem
maintainer's tree will almost certainly get all the way into the mainline.
But, even now, it's not all that rare for a patch to get stranded in a
forgotten repository branch somewhere.  When the system is handling tens of
thousands of patches every year, the occasional misrouted patch is just not
a surprise.
<p>
The simple truth of the matter is that many bugs are found by stable kernel
users; there are more of them and they try to use their kernels for real
work.  As this thread has shown, those users also tend to complain if the
specific fixes they need don't get into stable releases; they form an
effective monitoring solution that ensures that fixes are applied.  The
"mainline first" rule takes advantage of this network of users to ensure
that fixes are applied for the long term and not just for a specific stable
series.  At the cost of (occasionally) making users wait a short while for
a fix, it ensures that they will not need the same fix again in the future
and helps to make the kernel less buggy in general.  
<p>
Developers also took strong exception to the claim that applying a revert
is the same as having never applied the incorrect fix in the first place.
That can almost never be strictly true, of course; the rest of the kernel
will have changed between the fix and the revert, so the end product
differs from the initial state and may misbehave in new and interesting
ways.  But the real issue 
is that both the fix and the revert contain information beyond the code
changes: they document a bug and why a specific attempt to fix that bug
failed.  The next developer who tries to fix the bug, or who makes other
changes to the same code, will have more information to work with and,
hopefully, will be able to do a better job.  The "mainline first" rule
helps to ensure that this information is complete and that is it preserved
in the long term.
<p>
In other words, some real thought has gone into the creation of the stable
kernel rules.  The kernel development community, at this point, has
accumulated a great deal of experience that will not be pushed aside
lightly.  So the stable kernel rules are unlikely to be relaxed anytime
soon.  The one-sided nature of the discussion suggests that most developers
understand all of this.  That probably won't be enough to avoid the need to
discuss it all again sometime in the near future, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>This is not <em>quite</em> correct. If a patch goes into a stable branch and causes a regression there, but we know it doesn't cause that regression in mainline, <em>then</em> it is OK to revert it on the stable branch only (though in some cases it's better to cherry-pick the missed dependencies of the original patch from mainline). Also, a patch applied to the stable branch may sometimes look quite different from the corresponding patch(es) in mainline, but this is quite rare.</p>

I fail to see why this guy could not simply revert to 3.3.1, and/or file a bug in his distribution's bug-tracking system.  If he's on LKML, then I would assume he's compiling his own kernels and can thus even apply the patch himself...<br>

the stable tree is a branch from mainline.<br>
<p>
The intent is that it contains a subset of the changes that have gone into mainline since the branch point (on the theory that adding the other changes may cause regressions)<br>
<p>
the problem is that if changes are made to the stable branch that do not go into the mainline, then there is a real probability that the next stable branch will be missing the fix and users will break yet again<br>
<p>
if the fix goes into 3.3.2, but not 3.4-mainline, then when the 3.4.0 mainline release (and the 3.4.1 stable release) come out then the fix will not be there and users will break yet again and justifiably scream about the incompetent kernel developers who can't track fixes.<br>
<p>
this is the reason behind the policy that _nothing_ goes into stable unless it is already accepted into the mainline.<br>
<p>
This isn't a high bar to reach, if you have a fix, send it to Linus for acceptance and cc the stable tree and it will get into both, but if you _only_ send it to stable, it won't get in.<br>

Yeah, but doesn't merging stable into mainline (either via git merge, or by manually checking if any commit is missing in mainline) achieve the same thing, and allow stable to immediately include fixes?<br>

FWIW -- businesses have requirements to provide fixes immediately, but they also expect drivers to be backported, we obviously address backporting automatically, and we also have a way to address prioritizing upstream with these rules but also provide a mechanism for dealing with direct deliveries through the additional patches to stable patches:<br>

           </div>
Kernel development is not for people who lack persistence; changes can take
a number of revisions and a lot of time to make it into a mainline
release.  Even so, the story of the <a
href="https://landlock.io/">Landlock</a> security module, developed by
Mickaël Salaün, seems like an extreme case; this code was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/17ae69aba89d">merged for 5.13</a> after
more than five years of development and 34&nbsp;versions of the patch set.
This sandboxing mechanism has evolved considerably since LWN <a
href="/Articles/703876/">covered version&nbsp;3 of the patch set</a> in
2016, so a look at what Landlock has become is warranted.
<p>
Like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>,
Landlock is an unprivileged sandboxing mechanism; it allows a process to
confine itself.  The long-term vision has always included adding controls
for a wide range of possible actions, but those in the actual patches have been
limited to filesystem access.  In the early days, Landlock worked by
allowing a process to attach BPF programs to various security hooks in the
kernel; those programs would then make access-control decisions when
asked.  BPF maps would be used to associate specific programs with portions
of the filesystem, and a special <tt>seccomp()</tt> mode was used to
control the whole thing.
<p>
The goals behind Landlock have never been particularly controversial, but
the implementation is a different story.  The use of BPF was questioned
even before making BPF available to unprivileged users in any context <a
href="/Articles/796328/">fell out of favor</a>.  It was also
felt that <tt>seccomp()</tt>, which controls access to system calls, was a
poor fit for Landlock, which does not work at the system-call level.  For
some time, Salaün was encouraged by reviewers to add a set 
of dedicated system calls instead; it took him a while to give that
approach a try.
<p>
In the end, though, dedicated system calls turned out to be the winning
formula.  <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200224160215.4136-1-mic@digikod.net/">Version&nbsp;14</a>
of the patch set, posted in February 2020, dropped BPF in favor
of a mechanism for defining access-control rules and added a multiplexing
<tt>landlock()</tt> system call to put those rules into force.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200802215903.91936-1-mic@digikod.net/">20th
version</a> split the multiplexer into four separate system calls, but one
of those was dropped in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201008153103.1155388-1-mic@digikod.net/">the next
revision</a>.  So Landlock, as it will appear in 5.13, will bring three
system calls with it.

<p>
<h4>The 5.13 Landlock API</h4>
<p>

The first of those system calls creates a rule set that will be used for
access-control decisions.  Each rule set must be given a set of access
types that it will handle.  To define a rule set that can handle <i>all</i>
action types, one would start like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct landlock_ruleset_attr ruleset_attr = {
        .handled_access_fs =
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM,
    };
</pre>
<p>
(This example and those that follow were all taken from <a
href="https://landlock.io/linux-doc/landlock-v34/userspace-api/landlock.html">the
Landlock documentation</a>).
<p>
Once that structure is defined, it can be used to create the rule set
itself:
<p>
<pre>
    int landlock_create_ruleset(struct landlock_ruleset_attr *attr,
    				size_t attr_size, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>attr_size</tt> parameter must be the size of the
<tt>landlock_ruleset_attr</tt> structure (which allows for future
expansion in a compatible manner); <tt>flags</tt> must be zero (with 
one exception, described below).  If
all goes well, the return value will be a file descriptor representing the
newly created rule set.
<p>
That set does not actually contain any rules, yet, so it is of limited
utility.  The 5.13 version of Landlock only supports a single type of rule,
controlling access to everything contained within (and below) a given
directory.  The first step is to define a structure describing what
accesses will be allowed for a given subtree; to limit access to reading
and executing, one could use something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct landlock_path_beneath_attr path_beneath = {
        .allowed_access =
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE |
            LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR,
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>landlock_path_beneath_attr</tt> structure also contains a field
called <tt>parent_fd</tt> that should be set to a file descriptor for the
directory where the rule is to be applied.  So, for example, to limit
access to <tt>/usr</tt> to the above operations, a process could open
<tt>/usr</tt> as an <tt>O_PATH</tt> file descriptor, assigning the result
to <tt>path_beneath.parent_fd</tt>.  Finally, this rule should be added to
the rule set with:
<p>
<pre>
    int landlock_add_rule(int ruleset_fd, enum landlock_rule_type rule_type,
			  void *rule_attr, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>ruleset_fd</tt> is the file descriptor representing the rule set,
<tt>rule_type</tt> is <tt>LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH</tt> (the only
supported value, currently), <tt>rule_attr</tt> is a pointer to the
structure created above, and <tt>flags</tt> is zero.  The return value will
be zero if all goes well.  Multiple rules can be added to a single rule set.
<p>
The rule set has now been defined, but is not yet active.  To bind itself
to a given set, a process will call:
<p>
<pre>
    int landlock_restrict_self(int ruleset_fd, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Once again, <tt>flags</tt> must be zero.  This operation will fail unless
the process has previously called <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
with the <tt>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</tt> operation to prevent the acquisition
of capabilities through setuid programs.  Multiple calls may be made to
<tt>landlock_restrict_self()</tt>, each of which will increase the number
of restrictions in force.  Once a rule set has been made active, it cannot
be removed for the life of the process.  Rules enforced by Landlock will be
applied to any child processes or threads as well.
<p>
For the curious, there is a sample sandboxing program using Landlock that
was added in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ba84b0bf5a16">this
commit</a>.
<p>
<h4>After 5.13</h4>
<p>
Landlock is useful in its current form, but it can be expected to gain a
number of new 
features in future kernel releases now that the core infrastructure is in
place.  That could present a problem for sandboxing programs, which would
like to use those newer features but must be prepared to cope with older
kernels that lack them.  To help future application developers,
Salaün added a mechanism to help determine which features are available.
If <tt>landlock_create_ruleset()</tt> is called with <tt>flags</tt> set to
<tt>LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_VERSION</tt>, it will return an integer value
indicating which version of the Landlock API is supported; currently that
value will always be one.  When new features are added, the version number
will be increased; developers will thus be able to use the version to know
which features are supported on any given system.
<p>
Landlock has clearly reached an important milestone after more than five
years of work, but it seems just as clear that this story is not yet done.
After perhaps taking a well-deserved break, Salaün can be expected to start
fleshing out the set of Landlock features; with luck, these will not take
as long to find acceptance in the kernel community.  There may come a time
when Landlock can do much of what <tt>seccomp()</tt> can do, but perhaps in
a way that is easier for application developers to use.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Landlock and Pledge (and XNU Sandbox, and Capsicum) have the same goal: to sandbox applications. Landlock is a bit more complex than Pledge because of the differences between a Linux distro (i.e. a set of eclectic software, including various kernels) and OpenBSD (i.e. roughly a monolithic set of compatible software, with a specific kernel). One of Pledge&#x27;s strength is its simplicity, which is also a limitation. Landlock has a more flexible (and then more complex) kernel API than Pledge, but the idea is to rely on user space libraries to make the use of Landlock simple (e.g. the Pledge API could eventually be implemented with Landlock). This first release of Landlock targets basic file-system rights, which is the only objective of Pledge, but Landlock is designed to be able to support more fine-grained access-control types over time.<br>

LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_VERSION sounds like something that will work fine until the first time a distro kernel starts backporting Landlock features.  How willing will distros be to only ever take progress monotonically, and how likely are they not to screw it up by mistake?<br>

That is a reasonable concern and it was actually addressed by a previous version of Landlock with a dedicated syscall to get the set of available features. However, this approach was drastically simplified with the current version that only deal with a monotonic version, which is enough for the objective.<br>
<p>
Downstream users (e.g. distros) should not cherry-pick arbitrary features from Linux mainline without measuring the potential consequences. If they do so, they are responsible for the new forked kernel they create. It would also be a risk (and it seems weird, and it may be too cumbersome) for them to only pick partial features instead of the whole new features up to a point. This responsibility also requires to run kernel tests, including Landlock ones. I&#x27;ll do my best to maintain consistent tests, including version checks that are and will be part of the feature tests.<br>

<p>
&quot;It is currently not possible to restrict some file-related actions accessible through these syscall families: chdir(2), truncate(2), stat(2), flock(2), chmod(2), chown(2), setxattr(2), utime(2), ioctl(2), fcntl(2), access(2). Future Landlock evolutions will enable to restrict them.&quot;<br>

It is an incremental development; we can&#x27;t push a big chunk of new code, especially for security features, which should also come with exhaustive documentation, tests and reviews. BTW, most Linux access-control mechanisms don&#x27;t handle every possible access-control types. It is also an opportunity to take into account different use cases and wish lists. Anyhow, Landlock is already useful, the current limitations are explicit, and sandboxing can be improved thanks to features such as seccomp.<br>

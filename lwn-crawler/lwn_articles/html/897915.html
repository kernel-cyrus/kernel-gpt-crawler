<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
As with many conferences these days, the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM) had a virtual
component.  The main rooms were equipped with a camera trained on the
podium, thus the session leader, so that
remote participants could watch;  this camera connected into a Zoom
conference that allowed participation from afar.  In a session near the
end of the conference, led by conference organizer Josef Bacik, remote
participants were invited to share their 
experiences—on camera—with those who were there in person.  It was an
opportunity to discuss what went right—and wrong—with an eye toward
improving the experience for future events.
</p>

<p>
Ric Wheeler was first up; he said that aside from the first few minutes
where he could not hear anyone, "it was a good virtual experience". Mel
Gorman echoed that and noted that it "was infinitely superior to not being
able to participate at all".  One thing he noted is that the "raised hands"
in the Zoom interface were not monitored in some sessions.  There were two
sessions that he remembered where the speaker asked for objections or other
comments and he was left "screaming at the mic".  It is difficult to keep
an eye on that when leading a session, he said; it was only a minor detraction
from the overall great experience.
</p>

<p>
Bacik agreed that there were problems with ensuring that remote
participants were heard.  James Bottomley, who was onsite, asked why the
"curated mute" feature was chosen; "since we vaguely trust ourselves", why
not allow participants to unmute on their own?  Bacik said that he had not
really thought about it much going into LSFMM; eventually the filesystem
track switched to "unmute at will", which seemed to work well.
</p>

<p>
Remote participant Jan Kara agreed that being able to unmute when he wanted
to say something worked well, though, overall, the experience was "better
than I was expecting". Bottomley said that it would have been better if
Kara had turned on his video when he was going to talk, so that there was
someone to focus on rather than having a "disembodied voice from around the
room". Kara said he was unsure whether there was a way to see his video in
the room if he had done so; in fact, the video side of the Zoom conference
was only available if attendees were signed into it.  Unlike this session,
most of the others did not display 
the Zoom video on the conference-room screen.
</p>

<p>
Matthew Wilcox, who was present in Palm Springs, wanted to thank the remote
participants for putting in the effort to attend, especially those where it
was at being held at highly inconvenient times.  "You have made this such a
better conference."
</p>

<p>
A remote attendee said that LSFMM "went way better than I expected".  He is
more comfortable interacting via text than voice, so it was nice to have
the Zoom chat feature available.  Sometimes the chat got read to the room,
which was "really great".  If people introduced
themselves before they made comments on the microphone, he said, it would
help, especially for those who are new to the
community.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley asked if it would be better to have a chat that
everyone in the room could see (rather than just those logged into Zoom),
but the attendee said that giving the session leader the option to decide
if the comment was worth passing on made it less worrisome for him to make a
comment.  Onsite participant Ted Ts'o wondered if having a chat channel separate from
the videoconference application, as it is for the <a
href="https://lpc.events/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a> (LPC), made sense.
Sometimes having a chat back-channel is useful even when there is another
foreground conversation going on in the audio channel, he said. 
</p>

<p>
Another remote attendee said that the sessions with remote presenters,
where people could just comment without raising their hands, seemed to work
better. One problem they noticed was that the video resolution was not
sufficient to be able to read the slides or screen sharing much of the
time; larger fonts would be helpful.  An LSFMM virtual
presenter noted that he could not see which of the local attendees was
speaking, which was less than ideal.  Bottomley had pointed his laptop
camera at the room for the session and added it to the videoconference, but
said that it was hard to see who might be speaking.  For LPC, there will be
a 
camera operator at the front of the room who will zoom in on speakers, but
that "costs a fairly fantastic amount of money"; the laptop-camera option
might be better if it is at all useful, he said.
</p>

<p>
A first-time attendee, who was remote, said that 
"content-wise it was perfect", though there was a problem with the volume
oscillating periodically.  Another remote attendee had several suggestions
based on other events and meetings they had attended over the last few
years.  When the session leader wanders away from the podium, they are not
just leaving the video feed, he said, they are also stepping away from the
microphone so it can be hard to hear them at that point.   A separate wiki
or shared notes site that can be updated by everyone is helpful, as is a
"watcher of the tech space" to monitor hands being raised, chat messages,
and so on.  He thought the laptop camera was helpful from a feedback
perspective; if nothing else, it gives an indication of when might be a
good time to jump in with a remote comment.
</p>

<p>
One of the A/V people said that, based on doing other events of this sort, he
recommended having a separate screen at the front dedicated to the Zoom
conference instead of trying to share it with the slides and such. That
way, remote people can turn on their cameras and speak to the
room when they have comments or questions.  In addition, he agreed that
having someone in charge of paying attention to the videoconference side of
things (a "Zoom ambassador") is important.  Bacik thanked the A/V staff,
who did a "fantastic job", he said, using a modifier on that phrase that
anyone who knows him can guess.  That led to a loud round of applause for
the staff.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of the problems inherent in being a virtual
participant.  For example, the more-or-less nine-to-five schedule can be
even more difficult over video, which is why all-virtual events tend to
stretch out the schedule over more days.  That is not really possible for a
hybrid event, since the in-person attendees cannot typically stay for many
more days; the expense of renting the conference facility also factors into
that.
But virtually attending a conference in a different
time zone and then trying to put in a full day at the office "is brutal",
Gorman said.
</p>

<p>
In addition, virtual attendees miss out on the hallway track, which is
often cited as half the value of technical conferences, and the social
events, which are also valuable.  Gorman said that it might be kind of
creepy to try to somehow involve virtual attendees in those.  There are
tradeoffs that people are making when they attend virtually; missing out on
those pieces is just part of that, he said.  He is concerned that going too
far in trying to accommodate virtual attendees would reduce the value of the
in-person portion too much.  There was general agreement with that.
</p>

<p>
Overall, it would seem that LSFMM went well, both locally and virtually.
Much of that was due to the help of the Linux Foundation events staff, who Bacik
has been working with for three years as the conference was scheduled—then
canceled—several times.  He specifically thanked those folks in the 
conference closing session a few hours later.  It would seem there are some
fairly minor
improvements to be made, so a hybrid LSFMM next year should
be even better.

from testing and usage at FOSDEM and other conferences, you can do a mix with Jitsi and streaming, which works pretty well, or if you want more online participant, you can try BBB. Jitsi is ok up to ~20 people, I&#x27;ve seen BBB handle ~100, mostly because jitsi is fully peer-to-peer, BBB mixes the audio in itself (it uses FreeSwitch for that).<br>

Indeed, while reading this article I couldn&#x27;t help but thinking &quot;they are reinventing virtual FOSDEM&quot;. The experience of FOSDEM the last two years has been incredibly good, far better than I would have expected given the size of the event and the complexity, and it was all done using open source software.<br>

I like it when online sessions have a parallel chat: then you can ask your question and sometimes it gets answered by someone else so it doesn&#x27;t detract from the presentation. Some online presentation tools allow the host to highlight a message so it&#x27;s more visible. Helpful for minor clarifications that don&#x27;t need to interrupt the presentation.<br>
<p>
But the best is when you have someone who is there paying attention to the remote attendees and ensuring everything works well.<br>

The LWN coverage was also very nice, thanks!<br>

      In a recent company event I attended which had a remote component, the organizers had nominated for each session a "remote chat watcher" - someone physically in the room who had their laptop open and monitored the remote participants' chat, raised hands, etc.

<p>This worked extremely well, and ensured the remote participants were never ignored.

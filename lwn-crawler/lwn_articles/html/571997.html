<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The final sessions at the 2013 Kernel Summit were given over to a brief
discussion of the kernel's bug tracker, followed by a series of lightning
talks and a discussion of the summit itself.  
<p>
Konstantin Ryabitsev is one
of the kernel.org administrators hired 
after the Linux Foundation took over responsibility for that site.  One of
the many services he is charged with managing is the <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/">bugzilla system</a>.  He came to the
Kernel Summit asking if the community was happy with things and how could
the kernel's bug tracker be made more useful?
<p>
Rafael Wysocki responded that his group is using it to track ACPI and power
management bugs; it works well and they are happy with it.  Ted Ts'o said
that he tends to use specific bugs as a sort of miniature mailing-list

<a href="/Articles/572024/"><img

archive.  He often forgets to close out the bugs when things are resolved;
as a result, he's not particularly interested in getting status report
messages out of the system.
<p>
There was a request for better ways of tracking patches posted in response
to tracked bugs.  One developer complained that he would like to be able to
assign bugs to others, but the system won't allow that.  It seems that the
"edit bugs" permission is required; Konstantin said he is willing to give
that permission to anybody who requests it, but it was also suggested that
perhaps that permission should just be given to anybody who has a
kernel.org account.

</blockquote>
<p>
Russell King asked how he could get out of receiving mail for bugs in
subsystems that he no longer maintains; Konstantin's response was
"procmail."  More seriously, though, it's just a matter of sending him a
note and such issues will be taken care of.
<p>
Dave Jones noted that bugzilla is the second-worst bug tracker available,
with the absolute worst being "everything else."  He went on to say that
Fedora developers are <a href="/Articles/568716/">interested in using
upstream bug trackers more</a> and that, in particular, Fedora's kernel
developers would like to track bugs in the kernel.org bugzilla.  Beyond
that, though, they would like to feed bugs from Fedora's "Automatic Bug
Reporting Tool" directly into the system.  Anybody who has ever had to wade
through a morass of ABRT bugs in the Fedora tracker might be forgiven for
being worried about this idea, but, Dave said, things have gotten much
better and there aren't a whole lot of duplicate bugs anymore.  So the
assembled group was reasonably accepting of this idea, seeing it as a
replacement for the much-lamented kerneloops.org service if nothing else.
<p>
<h4>Lightning talks</h4>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/572025/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/LinusTorvalds-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Linus Torvalds]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

Linus wanted the group to know that the 3.13 merge window is likely to be
"chaos."   He has a bunch of travel coming up, including an appearance at
the <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/korea-linux-forum">Korea
Linux Forum</a>.  So he will be traveling during the merge window,
sometimes in places without any sort of reasonable network access.  
<p>
Ted asked whether it would just make sense to delay the release of 3.12
until Linus is back.  Linus responded that he could do that if people
wanted, but that it really wouldn't make much difference in the end.
There's going to be a period where he just isn't looking at pull requests,
but, he emphasized, maintainers should still get their pull requests in
early.  Greg added that, during this time, urgent stable fixes could,
contrary to normal policy, get into the stable tree prior to being merged
into the mainline; he won't hold them while Linus is off the net.
<p>
Dave Airlie asked: who out there is pining for kerneloops.org?  Anybody who
would like to see better tracking of the problems being encountered by
users might want to take a look at <a
href="https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/summary/">retrace.fedoraproject.org</a>.
It has plots of reports, information on specific problems, and more.  It's
a useful resource, he said, but he still wishes the kernel project had
somebody tracking regressions.
<p>
Dave Jones talked about his work digging through the reports generated by
Coverity's static analysis tool.  During the 3.11 merge window, he said,
the merging of the staging tree alone added 435 new issues to the
database.  He's been working on cleaning out the noise, but there are still
over 5000 open issues there.  A lot of them are false positives or failures
on the tool's part to understand kernel idioms; that noise makes it hard to
see the real bugs.  He's trying to clean things up over time.
<p>
He has been given the permission to allow others to see the problem list;
interested developers are encouraged to contact him.  He is also able to
see who else is looking at the problems.  A few of them are kernel
developers, he said, but most of the people looking at problem reports have
no commits in the tree.  Instead, they work for government agencies,
defense contractors, and commercial exploit companies.  The list "gave him
the creeps," he said.  Should those people be kicked out of the system?  It
might be possible, but they could then just buy their own Coverity license
or run a tool like smatch instead, so there would be little value in doing so.
<p>
Wireless network drivers are the leading source of problem reports,
followed by misc drivers, SCSI drivers, and network drivers as a whole.  In
general, he said, the "dark areas of the kernel" are the ones needing the
most attention.
<p>
Mathieu Desnoyers asked whether people working on their own static analysis
tools should be looking at Coverity's results.  That was acknowledged to be
a gray area.  Coverity does not appear to be a litigious company, but
people working in that area might still want to steer clear of Coverity's
results.
<p>
<h4>Future summits</h4>
<p>
Ted Ts'o closed out the day by asking: were developers happy with how the
kernel summit went, and what would they like to see changed?  The
participants seemed generally happy, but there were a couple of complaints
that the control group discussion was boring to many.  That follows a
longstanding Kernel Summit trend: highly technical subjects are generally
considered to be better addressed in a more specialized setting.
<p>
Much of the discussion was related to colocation with other events.  From a
show of hands, only about 20% of the Kernel Summit attendees found their
way over to LinuxCon, which was happening that same week.  The separation
of the venues (LinuxCon was a ten-minute walk away) certainly didn't help
in that regard.  In general, there were grumbles about how there was too
much going on, or that the "cloud stuff" (CloudOpen was also running at the
same time) is taking over.
<p>
Should the Kernel Summit be run as a standalone event?  The consensus
seemed to be that an entirely standalone summit doesn't work, but that,
with enough minisummits, it might be able to go on its own.  Should the
summit be colocated with the Linux Plumbers Conference, and possibly away
from everything else?  One problem with that is that, like the summit, LPC
is a high-intensity event; the two together make for a long week.  Still, a
straw poll indicated that most of the participants favored putting those
two conferences together.
<p>
Eventually the discussion wound down.  The group headed off for the group
photo, followed by a nice dinner and the TAB election.

About "looking at coverity results": at the Kernel Summit, I was merely pointing out that closing access to Linux kernel Coverity reports might hinder progress on research and development being done on open source static analyzers. Since Coverity reports don't include any detail about the underlying algorithms used underneath, I don't think looking at those reports could be an issue for anyone working on those static analyzers (but I'm not a lawyer). Keeping those open would just help comparing the quality of the various static analysis tools available.<br>

FWIW, after taking a look, it seems that wireless is leading the list because coverity is getting confused by 'enum nl80211_band' vs. 'enum ieee80211_band' and flagging every single use of any of those ...<br>

Yes, it seems to not be terribly clever with handling enums in general. In drm/i915 there's lots of reports about enum mismatches despite that we have explicit casts for all (or at least most) of these cases. Often with a comment that on a given hw generation pipes and transcoders are wired up in a fixed way, so casting is the Right Thing. Still coverity doesn't seem to get it. I'll plan to file those all as false positives and hope they improve the tool a bit.<br>

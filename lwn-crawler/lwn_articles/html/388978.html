<p>
One of the outcomes from the Collaboration Summit in April was a plan to
create a tracing ring buffer implementation that would work for both <a href="https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ftrace">Ftrace</a>
and <a href="http://lttng.org">LTTng</a>.  There was also hope that perhaps
the separate ring buffer added for <a
href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>
could be folded in as well, so that
the <a  
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/300992/">vision of a single ring buffer</a>
implementation in the kernel&mdash;from the 2008 Kernel Summit and Linux
Plumbers 
Conference&mdash;could come to fruition.  To that end, Steven Rostedt <a
href="/Articles/389199/">posted</a> an RFC for a unified ring buffer, but
before that conversation could really get going, it was diverted.  It seems
that Ingo Molnar 
thinks there are much bigger issues to resolve in the world of Linux tracing.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">ring buffer</a> is
a circular data structure that is often used to hold 
data that is produced and consumed by separate processes without
synchronization.  For tracing, the data is produced by the kernel outside
of any specific process's context, but the consumer is in user space.  The
kernel needs to hand out pages from the head of the ring buffer to user
space for consumption, while ensuring that it doesn't overwrite that data
as it writes 
to the tail of the buffer.

<p>
In his RFC, 
Rostedt recounts the history of tracing ring buffers, noting that the
Ftrace ring buffer did not become lockless until after perf came along.
Since perf needed to be able to record events in non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
contexts, it couldn't use 
the Ftrace ring buffer; instead, it used one of its own, written by Peter
Zijlstra. 
Eventually, Rostedt changed the Ftrace ring buffer to be <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/340400/">lockless</a>, but at that point, it
was too late 
for perf.  In addition, the perf ring buffer allows user space to
<tt>mmap()</tt> its pages, while the Ftrace ring buffer was geared to
in-kernel users and <tt>splice()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
So the kernel already has two tracing ring buffers, but there is also an
out-of-tree ring buffer to consider, which is the one used by LTTng.
That ring buffer has seen a lot of use in production Linux shops as well as
being integrated into various embedded Linux distributions.  In addition,
much as was done with RCU, LTTng project lead Mathieu Desnoyers did a
formal proof of the correctness 
of that ring buffer algorithm.  

<p>
At the Collaboration Summit, there was a
belief that the LTTng ring buffer could be extended to support all of the
Ftrace use cases.  It would seem that since then, Desnoyers has come up
with ways to support the perf ring buffer use cases as well.  Both Rostedt
and Desnoyers would like to nail down all of the requirements for (at
least) tracing
ring buffers and put together a single implementation that works for all of
them. Desnoyers has <a href="/Articles/389206/">put together a git tree</a>
that includes a bare bones ring buffer as a starting point.
</p>

<p>
But Andi Kleen is <a href="/Articles/389208/">not convinced</a> of the need
for a unified ring buffer, at least one that encompasses other non-tracing
uses. The Ftrace ring buffer is very complex and "<q>too clever</q>";
plenty of other subsystems use kfifo:
<div class="BigQuote">
In fact there
are far more users of it than of your ring buffer. And it's 
really quite simple and easy to use. And it works fine for them.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to ask "<q>If perf's current ring buffer works for it why not
keep using it?</q>". Rostedt more or less <a
href="/Articles/389209/">agrees</a> with the complexity argument, but notes
that there tends to be a misconception when people first look at the
problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
 You also bring up a point that I try very hard to get across. When
people think of a ring buffer, they think of the ones that they created
in CS101, not realizing that when you are dealing with production
systems, handling the requirements makes the buffering much more
complex.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Desnoyers also <a href="/Articles/389210/">points out</a> that tracing has
some requirements that other ring buffer users may not have:
<div class="BigQuote">
One requirement seems to be shared for most tracing heavy users: it has to be
blazingly fast. This is a requirement that is commonly overlooked by the "very
simple" implementations.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are advantages to sharing a ring buffer implementation among the
different tracing solutions beyond just fulfilling Linus Torvalds's mandate
from the 
2008 Kernel Summit.  High-performance ring buffer implementations tend to
be more complex than standard code according to Desnoyers, "<q>so it's good
if we can focus our review efforts on a single ring buffer</q>".  In
addition, if there is a common implementation, any performance tweaks
will help all of its users.
</p>

<p>
There is another underlying reason for a single ring buffer, though.
Molnar would like to see Ftrace phased out, with its functionality moved
into perf.  Rostedt is not necessarily opposed, but in order to do that,
there needs to be some ring buffer 
implementation that supports both.  The question is: how to get there?
</p>

<p>
Rather than directly commenting on the idea of a unified ring buffer
itself, Molnar 
<a href="/Articles/389212/">posted</a> a request for discussion on
"<q>Future tracing/instrumentation directions</q>".  In it, he makes
the case for moving Ftrace functionality to perf and suggests that Rostedt
and Desnoyers help Zijlstra with "<q>performance and simplification
work</q>" 
of the perf ring buffer:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] The 
last thing we need is yet another replace-everything 
event.
<p>
If we really want to create a new ring buffer abstraction 
i'd suggest we start with Peter's, it has a quite sane 
design and stayed simple and flexible [...]
</div>
</p>

<p>
Molnar believes that the performance of the current ring buffers
"<q>sucks,  in a big way. I've recently benchmarked it and it takes
hundreds of instructions to trace a single event</q>".  He also thinks
that the current "<q>ftrace/perf duality</q>" is hurting developers
and users.  One of the main things he would like to eliminate is the
debugfs interface for Ftrace, but that will take some time:
<div class="BigQuote">
The main detail here to be careful of is that lots of
     people are fond of the simplicity of the 
     /debug/tracing/ debug UI, so when we replace it we 
     want to do it by keeping that simple workflow (or 
     best by making it even simpler). I have a few ideas 
     how to do this.
<p>
     There's also the detail that in some cases we want to
     print events in the kernel in a human readable way: 
     for example EDAC/MCE and other critical events,
     trace-on-oops, etc. This too can be solved.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Thomas Gleixner and Ted Ts'o both spoke up in favor of the kernel events
and tracepoints
being discoverable from user space.  Currently, that is well-supported by Ftrace
using its debugfs interface, and both would like to see that
continue.  Gleixner wants simple tracing tools for embedded
devices&mdash;eventually made a part of BusyBox&mdash;that don't have to
change when new tracepoints or events are added.  Ts'o on the other hand
wants to be able to have bash-completion scripts that can figure out
tracepoint names.  Molnar <a href="/Articles/389279/">agreed</a> that it is
important to maintain that ability going forward.
</p>

<p>
There is some debate about how badly the Ftrace ring buffer performs.
Molnar is quite <a href="/Articles/389286/">critical</a> of its
performance, but Rostedt <a href="/Articles/389288/">disputes</a> some of
those findings.  In the end, there doesn't seem to be much disagreement that
a better performing ring buffer could be created, there is just a question
of how it should be approached.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt does not think that starting with the perf ring buffer is the right
approach: "<q>The current ring buffer in perf is very coupled with the perf
design.</q>"  Molnar, though, is leery of bringing yet another
ring buffer implementation into the picture:
<div class="BigQuote">
We've got two ring buffer implementations right now, one 
has to be replaced.
<p>
It doesnt mean we should disrupt _two_ implementations and 
put in a third one, unless there are strong technical 
reasons for doing so.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Those strong technical reasons may be found in the performance numbers for
the various implementations.  If Rostedt and Desnoyers can produce a
ring buffer that works for Ftrace and perf, while performing better than
either existing implementation, it seems likely that it would find a clear path
into the kernel.  As the discussion has trailed off, one gets the sense
that the participants are now benchmarking and tweaking their
implementations to try to achieve that.
</p>

<p>
The ring buffer implementation is at the heart of any Linux tracing
solution; its capabilities and performance will largely dictate how
intrusive tracing is on the rest of the system, which in turn impacts how
useful the tracing output is.  The fact that several smart developers have
yet to come up with a super-low-impact solution speaks volumes about the
difficulty of the problem.  With all of the work that is currently going
on, though, it seems likely that one way or another a high-performance
ring buffer&mdash;with lower overall complexity&mdash;will come about.

<p>
Another interesting outcome from this discussion, short though it may have
been, is that we are likely to see Ftrace fade away over time.  The
functionality won't disappear, it and much of the Ftrace code would be moved
into perf, but 
Ftrace itself&mdash;which really started the (relatively) recent mainline
tracing push&mdash;might well be gone sometime in the next few kernel
development cycles.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Can I just say "Aaargh!" at the thought of having to relearn tracing?  This continual churn on implementation and interfaces is a royal pain to keep up with.

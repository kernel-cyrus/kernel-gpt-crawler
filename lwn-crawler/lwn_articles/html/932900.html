"I/O hints" for storage devices, which are meant to improve performance by
giving the devices 
extra information about the nature of the I/O, have a long history with
Linux. 
But the code
for write hints was "ripped out last year", according to a <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/Y%2F7L74P6jSWwOvWt@mit.edu/">message</a> from Ted
Ts'o proposing a discussion about new optimizations for cloud-storage devices.
That discussion took place in a
combined storage and filesystem session at the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>.  In it, Ts'o proposed that the Linux
community define its own set of hints rather than just following along with the
hints in the standards—which have largely been ignored by the vendors in
any case. 
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
He began by pointing out that "we have been talking about this set of
storage extensions for freaking ever"; the earliest LSFMM discussion that he
found was <a href="/Articles/548296/">from the&nbsp;2013 event</a>, but he
wondered if that was actually the earliest.  There is mention of I/O hints in
the <a href="/Articles/490501/">report</a> from day two of LSFMM&nbsp;2012
that indicates the topic had already been around for a
while, but perhaps not before that at LSFMM. "Here we are ten years
later—possibly longer", he said, to knowing 
chuckles around the room; he wanted to reflect a bit on why that was.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Working with the standards committees is "slow and expensive"; he has done
it and would not necessarily recommend it for others. It requires a lot of
travel and there are several bodies involved, which multiplies the
problem, especially in times where budgets are tight.  But, then, even if a
spec gets approved, hardware vendors rarely actually implement these
features in easily available devices; it is often only available in
high-end, extremely expensive drives.

</blockquote>
<p>
As a result of that, I/O hints were added to the kernel but were removed
around&nbsp;18 months ago because no one was using them, he said. "They're 
back" was heard from the audience to more chuckles. But Ts'o thinks things
can be a bit different this time around because of the prevalence of
cloud-based emulated block devices, which are essentially software-defined
storage.  Those devices can be updated with new features much more easily
and quickly than waiting for hardware vendors to decide to implement
something.  In addition, in the past "hardware vendors would care about
$OTHER_OS" and did not care what Linux people thought; but these days the
dominant OS running on cloud virtual machines is Linux.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that there is a weekly call among ext4 and other filesystem
developers that 
coincidentally has attendees from Oracle, Amazon, and Google, who are, of
course, cloud vendors.  Many of the call attendees are thinking about doing
similar things with their filesystems, which involve "making assumptions
about how the emulated block device in the cloud works".  It occurred to
him that they could do more than that; "the somewhat radical idea" that he
wanted to propose is that the Linux community could  add its own vendor
extensions that could be used by
these devices. 
</p>

<p>
Instead of some storage vendor being responsible for the extension, it
would come from the Linux community.  A reference implementation could be
created for QEMU and if one or more cloud vendors could be convinced to
adopt it, "then it could be purposely built for us".  Developers would not
have to try to
figure out how to map the SCSI I/O hints from a decade ago to Linux, he said.
</p>

<p>
Storage-track organizer Martin Petersen pointed out that in his hints work from
ten years ago,  
he had mapped <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html"><tt>posix_fadvise()</tt></a>
flags to SCSI and NVMe hints; he shopped that around to various storage
vendors as 
what would make sense for Linux "and it went nowhere".  He is strongly in
favor of reviving the effort and calling it a "Linux cloud" extension; "it
makes a ton of sense, it fixes a ton of performance problems, and it is
like 150 lines of code".
</p>

<h4>Cloud optimizations</h4>

<p>
Given that attendees seemed to be in favor of the overall plan, Ts'o wanted
to talk about specific optimizations that he and others are thinking
about.  The cloud vendors have observed that MySQL and PostgreSQL both
use&nbsp;16KB database pages and would like to be able to write those in  
all-or-nothing fashion.  That guarantee could come from the kernel or the
hardware, he said, but the requirement is for no "torn writes"
(i.e. partial writes).
</p>

<p>
NVMe already has a an atomic-write extension and one is being added to
SCSI, but with slightly different semantics, Ts'o said.  But, today, "as an
accident of implementation", due to the flags that get passed in the BIO
for a direct I/O write, the block layer will not tear an aligned&nbsp;16KB
write; it "will not split them apart in awkward places".
</p>

<p>
Buffered I/O is not treated that way, he said, which can lead to torn
writes.  But for 
direct I/O, he and others have "desk-checked the code" as well as running
torture tests to try to cause torn writes.  There are some who are thinking
of deploying this as it stands, but others are looking for a guarantee from
the operating system rather than just rely on an accident of the implementation.
</p>

<p>
An OS guarantee is a reasonable request, Ts'o said; in addition, getting
some kind of atomic solution for buffered I/O would be great because PostgreSQL
only does buffered I/O.  This would allow database systems to eliminate
their double-buffered writes.  So far, it seems to work fine for the
cloud-storage devices; 
"maybe there are some weird semantics between NVMe and SCSI, but we don't
care". 
</p>

<p>
It would be nice if the block layer could find out whether the device
guarantees that it will not tear for aligned writes of,
say,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;32, or&nbsp;64KB, so that the block layer can also split
on those 
boundaries. Storage-track organizer Javier González pointed out that there
is upcoming LSFMM session on support for large block sizes; there are
already patches for some of that support available. 
</p>

<p>
Luis Chamberlain, who would be leading the large-block discussion the next
day, wondered about the limit of the size of the atomic writes that users
want and how that relates to the block size that the device specifies.
Keith Busch said that for NVMe SSDs today, the sizes for atomic guarantees
range from 4KB up to 64KB.  But Fred Knight pointed out that there is a
large storage vendor that guarantees atomic writes of "hundreds of
megabytes", but the block size is 4KB.  Since a large vendor has done that,
he suspects that others will too.  Chamberlain concluded that there would
be value in supporting block sizes beyond 64KB.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that providing information that a set of blocks is associated
with a particular inode could be used by storage devices for, say, garbage
collecting all of them together.  He does not know how practical that
actually is, but as a filesystem developer he has no problem adding the
inode information if it will help.  Petersen said that he and Christoph
Hellwig had a proposal like that, using a hash of the inode number, around
ten years ago that also did not go anywhere.  But James Bottomley wondered
if it even mattered; since there are mostly extent-based filesystems that
write large extents,  can't the storage devices just use the large write as
a signal that the blocks go together?  Ts'o said that was probably
workload-dependent, but that this particular optimization was not really
one of his priorities.
</p>

<p>
A more interesting optimization in his mind is giving the device hints
about whether a read is actually synchronous from an application or whether
it is coming from the block layer doing a readahead of some kind.  But
Petersen and Josef Bacik said there is already a flag being used for that;
Petersen said that it is needed because a failed readahead is not treated
the same as a failed application read.
</p>

<p>
Another optimization, which has probably seen the most work over the years,
Ts'o said, is 
to provide a 
hint that a given write is for data, metadata, or a journal.  That journal
indication could be for a filesystem journal or a database journal.  That
could allow the storage devices to prioritize the writes that are truly
important versus those from background activities like backups.
</p>

<h4>Working group</h4>

<p>
He thinks that a working group including cloud-vendor representatives could
define something along those lines, which could be implemented in QEMU.
Using that to 
demonstrate the benefits could lead the cloud vendors to start implementing
the feature. Bart Van Assche asked that Android be included in any such
working group;  the project is working on a proposal to standardize write
hints to distinguish between data and metadata writes.
González said that the NVMe device in QEMU is only used for compliance
testing, not for performance, so there has been talk of creating another
NVMe device for QEMU with a fast path that could go directly to a <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/vfio.html">VFIO</a> passthrough
device. 
</p>

<p>
There was some fast-paced disagreement about whether the NVMe and SCSI
standards bodies needed to see an open-source implementation before
actually standardizing something.  In the end, that may not matter, Ts'o
said, if there is a "Linux cloud" vendor extension, things that fall under
it do not need to
work for the hardware vendors.  He has observed that sometimes those
vendors are more interested in throwing sand in the gears of the
standardization process than they are in adding features—especially if they
perceive it might give competitors an 
advantage.  That statement was met with laughing denials from various parts
of the room.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the Linux community can move much more quickly without having to
go to standards meetings in far-flung places multiple times per year, Ts'o
said. "We can just simply make something that works"; people who can go to
the standards meetings can take that work and standardize it if they want.
He thinks it might be easier to align the cloud-storage people, which can
result in a quicker turnaround on these kinds of features. 
</p>

<p>
González asked if Ts'o had some kind of governing or organizing body in
mind for this work, but Ts'o said he had not gotten that far.  He thought
that something informal, which resulted in something that works in QEMU,
would be sufficient, but if a more formal organization is needed, the Linux
Foundation would be an obvious possibility.  His suggestion would be to
keep the process as lightweight as possible though, and liked Petersen's
idea
that the linux-fsdevel mailing list be the "organization".

Correct. I doubt we will change the size of data pages anytime soon. There's been some discussion about changing the journal page size though - but that isn't really relevant in this context.<br>
<p>
One issue is that it turns out that our torn write protection massively speeds up WAL replay, due to removing nearly all random reads in common workloads (the buffer pool can be seeded by the page images included in the WAL). Particularly on comparatively high latency cloud storage that's a hard benefit to give up... <br>

The first time a durable data page is modified after a checkpoint, we include a "full page image" (FPI) in the relevant WAL record (eliding unused page space, optionally that image is compressed), instead of the normal "incremental" description of what has changed on the page. That way crash recovery / WAL replay never needs to rely on the potentially torn page contents after a crash, as we know that any such modification has to be preceded by an FPI. There are some optimizations to not generate FPIs, e.g. because we are re-initializing with different content.<br>
<p>
Of course this has the, fairly significant, downside of increasing the WAL size substantially for some workloads...<br>
<p>
The FPIs can be used during WAL replay to seed the contents of the buffer pool, as they are complete page contents. As long as the set of pages modified during a checkpoint fits into the buffer pool, this eliminates just about all reads.<br>

      Would using direct, async I/O with <code>io_uring</code> solve this problem?  As long as one can queue a large number of I/O requests before needing any results, latency should not be a significant problem.

"It depends". Even on NVMe small random reads tend to be more expensive than larger sequential reads. On commercial clouds you pay for IOPS and also the latencies are considerably higher - making the random reads more of a problem. <br>
<p>
We have some readahead for blocks referenced in the WAL starting in PG 15 and there's more upcoming work. <br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; In fact, the Linux community can move much more quickly without having to go to standards meetings in far-flung places multiple times per year, Ts'o said. "We can just simply make something that works"; people who can go to the standards meetings can take that work and standardize it if they want.</span><br>

This sounds amazing! It would definitely deal with this common issue:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; He has observed that sometimes those vendors are more interested in throwing sand in the gears of the standardization process than they are in adding features—especially if they perceive it might give competitors an advantage.</span><br>

Stalling to protect revenue is not specific to hardware, here's a very high profile example: <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/safari-is-killing-the-web/">https://httptoolkit.com/blog/safari-is-killing-the-web/</a><br>

Standardization is very funny: it's critical for commoditization and competition but it can also being misused for stalling innovation. This complexity makes propaganda and fake news easy.<br>
<p>
The perfect balance really seems to be "innovate first, standardize later". This is how GSM, Type-C charging (PD) and... the Internet were born. From <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/ietf.html">https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/ietf.html</a> (for instance)<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Two major differences stand out if one compares the IETF standards track with the process in other standards organizations. First, the final result of most standards bodies is approximately equivalent to the IETF Proposed Standard status. A good idea but with no requirement for actual running code. The second is that rough consensus instead of unanimity can produce proposals with fewer features added to quiet a noisy individual.</span><br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; In brief, the IETF operates in a bottom-up task creation mode and believes in "fly before you buy."</span><br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; There is mention of I/O hints in the report from day two of LSFMM 2012 (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/490501/">https://lwn.net/Articles/490501/</a>) that indicates the topic had already been around for a while,</span><br>
<p>
Thanks for linking to that old report: this is the nicest introduction to "write amplification" I have ever found! I guess search engines could not find it because the page is part of a larger report with several other topics. Looks like AI still has some way to go before it can write LWN articles :-)<br>
<p>
On the other hand write amplification and "TRIM" did not seem to be mentioned this time? Because it's a solved problem?<br>

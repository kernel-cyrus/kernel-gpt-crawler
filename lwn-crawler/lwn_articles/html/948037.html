           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 25, 2023</br>

The kernel has, for many years, had the ability to control how memory
allocation is performed in systems with multiple NUMA nodes.  More
recently, NUMA nodes have also been pressed into service to represent
different classes of memory; those nodes are now organized into tiers
according to their performance characteristics.  While memory-allocation
policies can control the placement of pages at the NUMA-node level, the
kernel provides no way to connect those policies with memory tiers.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231009204259.875232-1-gregory.price@memverge.com/">This
patch series</a> from Gregory Price aims to change this situation by
allowing allocations to be placed across tiers in a weighted manner.
<p>
The days when computers simply had "memory" have passed.  Systems now can
contain numerous types of memory with wildly different performance
profiles.  Persistent memory can be available in large quantities, but it
is relatively slow.  <a href="/Articles/894598/">CXL memory</a> may be
faster, though still not as fast as normal DRAM, and it can come and go
during the life of the system.  High-bandwidth memory can be faster than
normal DRAM.  Devices, too, can make their own memory available on the
system's memory bus.  Each memory provider is represented in the system as
one or more CPU-less NUMA nodes.
<p>
Tiering is the process of grouping these nodes into levels (tiers) with
similar performance, then working to place memory optimally in each tier;
it is a work in progress.  The kernel only gained a formal concept of
memory tiers in the 6.1 release, when <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220818131042.113280-1-aneesh.kumar@linux.ibm.com/">this
series</a> from Aneesh Kumar K.V. was merged.  The kernel now assigns each
node an "abstract distance" reflecting its relative performance; by
default, all nodes have an abstract distance of 512.  Memory with a lower
abstract distance than that is expected to be faster than ordinary DRAM,
while a higher abstract distance indicates slower memory.  Notably, the
distance is set by the driver that makes the memory available to the
system; it is not subject to direct administrator control.
<p>
As memory is initialized, the kernel will organize it into distinct tiers,
with the tier number for any given node obtained by dividing its abstract
distance by&nbsp;128.  Normal memory, with its default abstract distance of
512, ends up in tier four as a result.  There is, thus, room for four tiers
of memory that is faster than DRAM, and a vast number of slower tiers.
<p>
The kernel can use tiering to make decisions about page placement; <a
href="/Articles/893024/">quite a bit of work</a> has gone into trying to
figure out how to move pages between the tiers.  When pages are unused,
they can be demoted to slower tiers rather than being reclaimed entirely;
that is a relatively easy decision that fits into existing
memory-management practices.  Deciding when pages should be promoted back
to faster memory, though, is a bit trickier.  Importantly, this work has
been focused on moving memory to the correct tier after it has been in use
for a while and its relative busyness can be assessed.
<p>
Price's patch set builds on the tiering mechanism, but is aimed at a
different problem: what is the optimal <i>original</i> placement for pages
when they are first allocated?  In particular, it addresses the practice of
NUMA interleaving, wherein allocations are spread out across a set of NUMA
nodes with the purpose of getting consistent performance from any of a set
of the CPUs on the system.  NUMA interleaving has worked for years, but it
is relatively simple; it spreads pages equally across the set of nodes
provided in the memory policy set by the application.  Interleaving has no
concept of tiers and no ability to bias allocations in any specific
direction. 
<p>
The patch series adds the concept of a "weight" to each NUMA tier.  Weights
are relative to each CPU, so the weight of tier&nbsp;2 as seen from
CPU&nbsp;0 may be different than the weight of that tier seen from
CPU&nbsp;10.  These weights determine how strongly allocation decisions
should be biased toward each tier; a higher weight for a given tier results
in more pages being allocated on nodes contained within that tier.  Unlike
the abstract distance, the tier weights are controlled by the
administrator; a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    echo 0:20 &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/memory_tiering/memory_tier2/interleave_weight
</pre>
<p>
would set the weight of tier 2, as seen by CPU&nbsp;0, to&nbsp;20.  By
default, all tiers have a weight of one.
<p>
These weights are used by the NUMA interleaving code when pages are
allocated.  If a system has two tiers, tier&nbsp;4 (where normal DRAM ends
up) and tier&nbsp;8 (with slower memory), and the weights of those tiers
for the current CPU are set to&nbsp;20 and&nbsp;10 respectively, then
interleaved allocations will place twice as many pages on tier&nbsp;4 as on
tier&nbsp;8.  It's worth noting that, while the application specifies its
NUMA allocation policy (which nodes it wants to allocate memory on), the
weights are solely under the control of the administrator.
<p>
While promotion and demotion between tiers is aimed at putting the
most-used pages on the fastest memory, weighted allocation has a different
objective — necessarily, since the kernel cannot know at allocation time
which pages will be the most heavily used.  The intent, instead, is to try
to obtain an optimal split of memory usage across memory controllers,
maximizing the bandwidth utilization of each.  Moving some pages from
faster memory to a slower tier can result in an overall performance
increase, even if the moved pages are actively used, if the end result is
to keep both tiers busily moving data.
<p>
According to Price, this approach works:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Observed a significant increase (165%) in bandwidth utilization
	with the newly proposed multi-tier interleaving compared to the
	traditional 1:1 interleaving approach between DDR and CXL tier
	nodes, where 85% of the bandwidth is allocated to DDR tier and 15%
	to CXL tier with MLC -w2 option.
</blockquote>

(MLC refers to Intel's proprietary <a
href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intelr-memory-latency-checker.html">memory
latency checker</a> tool).
<p>
This is the second version of this patch set (the first was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230927095002.10245-1-ravis.opensrc@micron.com/">posted
by Ravi Jonnalagadda</a> in late September).  There have been a number of
comments about the details of the implementation, but there does not appear
to be any opposition to the concept in general.  Since all tiers start with
an identical weight, there will be no changes to NUMA interleaving unless
the administrator has explicitly changed the system's configuration.  There
would thus appear to be little reason for this work not to advance once the
details have been taken care of.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

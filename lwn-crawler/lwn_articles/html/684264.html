<h1>A storage standards update</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 20, 2016</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2016/">LSFMM 2016</a>
</div>
<p>
The opening plenary at the 2016 <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-storage-filesystem-and-mm-summit">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit</a> (LSFMM) was an update from Fred Knight and Peter
Onufryk 
on some of the relevant storage standards.  Knight covered changes that are coming from the <a
href="http://www.t10.org/">T10</a> (SCSI) and <a
href="http://www.t13.org/">T13</a> (ATA) technical committees, while
Onufryk talked about changes in the <a href="http://www.nvmexpress.org/">NVM
Express</a> (NVMe) interface specification for SSDs.
</p>

<h4>T10 and T13</h4>

<p>
Knight began with "conglomerates", which is a feature that has been in the
T10 standard for a
while.  It is a way to group logical units.  The 64-bit logical unit number (LUN)
is split into two pieces: a major number, which identifies the group
(conglomerate), and a minor number that identifies the unit within the
group.  There are new SCSI commands (<tt>BIND</tt>, <tt>UNBIND</tt>, ...)
to create and manage these conglomerates.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>WRITE ATOMIC</tt> and <tt>WRITE SCATTER</tt> commands were up
next.  The former will either write all of the data or none of it.  Some
think that is how SCSI currently works, but if a write returns an error,
there is no guarantee of how much data has been written.

<p>
<tt>WRITE SCATTER</tt> allows specifying logical block address (LBA) and
length pairs, followed by the data for each segment, and will write the segments.  There
are no guarantees of atomicity, however, for the entire scatter write.
Developers have asked for scatter and atomic to be combined somehow, but that
made the storage vendors pull their hair out, Knight said, so the T10
committee said "no way".  One thing that could be added that "may be
useless" is to guarantee that
each individual segment will either be written or not in its entirety. But
the order of the writes is not known, so an error will indicate that some or
all of the writes were not done.
</p>

<p>
There were complaints from the audience that some vendors could do atomic
scatter writes, but that the large vendors don't want to do so, which is
unfortunate.  Knight said creating the standard for it is not the hard
part&mdash;it is getting the vendors to agree to implement it. 
</p>

<p>
Write streams are a way to associate writes so that the data ends up
physically "close" on the device.  Its origin is in current flash hardware
that can be more efficient if writes to the same file end up in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Block_erasure">erase
blocks</a>, rather than scattered in many all over the drive.  The number 
of streams is vendor dependent; it is currently up to 255, but there are
vendors that want to have much lower limits.  There is a reserved byte in
the command to potentially expand the stream ID to 16 bits.  It is a
feature that is focused on supporting current hardware, so it is unclear
how long it will stay relevant as flash hardware evolves in coming years,
he said. 
</p>

<p>
SCSI universally unique IDs (UUIDs) are assigned to vendors by the IEEE
but, with the advent of software-defined storage (SDS), there needs to be a way
to generate these IDs.  The standard has been updated so that SDS devices
can create an ID for their use.  This was a feature
that came directly from the Linux community, Knight said.
</p>

<p>
"Hints" for I/O (which are called "logical block markup" in T13) give
information to the device about the expected access pattern for the data.
The device is not obligated to remember or act on the hints; there are a
bunch that are listed in the standards, but there are only two or three
that make a difference.  One of those is a way to "tag" I/O operations,
which can, for example, separate operations for keys, data, and metadata
that will help make databases run faster.
</p>

<p>
There was a question about why both streams and hints were supported, as it
seems that they do much the same thing.  But Knight said that streams are
meant to place the data in the stream physically close on the device, while
hints are meant to indicate the access patterns for the data.  They can be
used together, but hints can be ignored by the device.
</p>

<p>
There are some new log pages for additional statistics and counters,
including counts of misaligned I/Os (e.g. 512-byte writes to a device with
a 4KB block size) and compression and deduplication statistics.  There is a
new application tag mode page for the protection information that is used
for data integrity, as well.  The
application tag can be placed in that page and does not need to be sent
with the protection information on each block.
</p>

<p>
Next up was "depop" (or depopulation), which is a way to remove a
portion of a device based on the failure of a head or other element.  There
are proposals for depop being worked on in T10, T13, and NVMe, Knight
said.  For today's 10TB or 20TB drives, if some component in
the device goes bad, people want to keep using it.  Manufacturers are
already doing this; if they make a 10TB drive and find that 4TB are bad,
they sell it as a 6TB drive to consumers.
</p>

<p>
Offline depop is effectively just a reformat of the drive for its new
capacity.  There is work on online depop going on, but there are "some
interesting problems to be solved".  The organization of logical
blocks on a device is such that loss of a head (or a die on an SSD) does
not equate to a simple range of LBAs, so the drive will need to report the
list of bad LBAs to the host.  Knight said that the committees are
interested in any input that Linux developers can provide.
</p>

<p>
Knight closed his portion of the talk by noting that he has some amount of
his time available to work with the Linux community to take its ideas to
the standards bodies.  He said that protection information without an
application tag that he mentioned earlier was a suggestion from outside, as
was the idea of hybrid 
drives that are partially regular disks and partially shingled magnetic
recording (SMR) drives.  He encouraged those interested to give him ideas
to take back to the committees.
</p>

<h4>NVMe</h4>

<a href="/Articles/684405/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/lsf-onufryk-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Peter Onufryk]" title="Peter Onufryk" width=250 height=250>
</a>

<p>
Onufryk introduced the NVMe organization, which consists of several
workgroups under a board.  The management interface workgroup is concerned
with controlling and monitoring NVMe devices.  For example, the interface
provides information on what devices are available, the temperature of the
disks, and so on.  Vendors want to be able to use it to update the firmware
on the devices as well.  There will also be work coming up on enclosure management
and LED control, among other things.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley noted that the management interface allows changes that
happen without any notification to the operating system.  He asked if there
was a way for Linux to find out what these changes are.  That is a "real
mess right now", Onufryk said.  The first version of the specification
just focused on how to control and monitor the drive, but there will be work on how the
management interface should integrate with the host.  It is a "complex
problem", though.
</p>

<p>
The technical workgroup is working on two big things: NVMe over fabrics and
enhancements to NVMe for streams, directives, and virtualization.  Fabric
support is aimed at scaling NVMe to thousands of drives, which is beyond
what is practical with PCIe.  The idea is to have a thin encapsulation of
the NVMe protocol that will work on fabrics.  The first target is remote
DMA (RDMA), though work is also being done on Fibre Channel.
</p>

<p>
There has been a lot of "blood, sweat, and tears" to keep the PCIe and
fabric versions aligned.  That means device makers should be able to switch
out PCIe for RDMA or some other fabric and not change things much.  We will
"see if it works".
</p>

<p>
While there is roughly 90% commonality between the PCIe and fabric
implementations, there are some differences.  The major ones are the
identifier used to target a particular device and the way that devices are
discovered.  The queueing and data transfer are quite similar between the two.
</p>

<p>
The specification for NVMe over fabrics will likely be accepted by the end
of May, at which point it will become public.  Host and target drivers for
Linux are under development.  They will be released as open source when the
specification is released.
</p>

<p>
The first of the NVMe enhancements Onufryk presented was on host-device
information exchange.  To best use NVM, the
host and device need to exchange various kinds of information beyond just
the I/O data.  That exchange can take place at various points
(before, during, or after a data access) and can target various elements
(LBA, the physical media or partition, or the access relationship).
</p>

<p>
One piece of information that can be given to the device from the host was
mentioned by Knight earlier: stream IDs.  For NVMe, those IDs are 16-bit
values in the write commands to identify writes that are associated with
each other because they are expected to have the same lifetime.   There is
little available space in the NVMe command packet so a "directive" type and
ID was added that can be used for streams or other hints to be sent with
the commands, but only per command.
</p>

<p>
There are also some virtualization enhancements to NVMe.  Today there are
emulated hardware devices or paravirtualized drivers, which just puts software in
the way, Onufryk said.  There is a need to provide direct access to NVMe
devices from virtual machines.
</p>

<p>
The NVMe architecture supports <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_IOV">single-root I/O
virtualization</a> (SR-IOV), but more is needed.  In particular, the new
virtualization enhancements will define a standard mechanism to allocate
interrupt and queue 
resources to a virtual NVMe device.  There are also additions to control
the performance of the virtual devices so that the performance 
of the entire device can be split up between virtual machines—with each
getting a specific portion of that performance.
</p>

<p>
Those enhancements have all been approved for the next revision of the
specification.  Someone asked about the status of <a
href="/Articles/637436/">copy offload</a> for NVMe.  Onufryk said that it
is not yet being worked on and that <a href="/Articles/592645/">thin
provisioning</a> is in the same bucket.

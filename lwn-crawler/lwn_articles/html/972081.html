           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 3, 2024</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers are encouraged to send their changes in small batches as
a way of making life easier for reviewers.  So when a longtime developer
and maintainer hits the list with a 437-patch series touching 859 files,
eyebrows are certain to head skyward.  Specifically, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240411153126.16201-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">this series
from Jens Axboe</a> is cleaning up one of the core abstractions that has
been part of the Linux kernel almost since the beginning; authors of device
drivers (among others) will have to take note.
<p>
<h4>The origin of <tt>struct file_operations</tt></h4>
<p>
In the beginning, the Linux kernel lacked any sort of virtual filesystem
layer.  See, for example, the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source/fs/read_write.c#L49">0.01
implementation</a> of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html"><tt>read()</tt></a>,
which contained explicit checks for each possible file-descriptor type.
That approach worked to get an initial kernel to boot but, before long,
Linus Torvalds realized that it would not scale well. As developers sought
to add more device types, and to implement more than one filesystem type,
the need for an abstraction layer became more urgent.
<p>
The Linux 0.95 release, which came out in March 1992, brought a number of
changes, including a switch to the GPL license.  It also added the first
pieces of what was to become the kernel's virtual filesystem layer.  A
core piece of that layer was  <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.95/source/include/linux/fs.h#L139">the
first <tt>file_operations</tt> structure</a>, defined, in its entirety, as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct file_operations {
	int (*lseek) (struct inode *, struct file *, off_t, int);
	int (*read) (struct inode *, struct file *, char *, int);
	int (*write) (struct inode *, struct file *, char *, int);
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure contains the pointers to the functions needed to implement
specific system calls on anything that can be represented by a file
descriptor.  Rather than use an extended
<tt>if</tt>-<tt>then</tt>-<tt>else</tt> sequence to determine which type of
file was being operated on, the kernel could just do an indirect call to
the appropriate <tt>file_operations</tt> member.  As might be expected, the
most fundamental operations — reading, writing, and seeking — showed up
here first.  In early versions of the kernel, there wasn't much else that
one could do with a file descriptor.
<p>
The <tt>file_operations</tt> structure grew from there.  The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/1.0/source/include/linux/fs.h#L265">1.0
version of this structure</a> included ten members, implementing system
calls like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readdir.2.html"><tt>readdir()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>,
and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>.
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.0/source/include/linux/fs.h#L455">2.0
version of <tt>struct file_operations</tt></a> had 13 members, and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.2.0/source/include/linux/fs.h#L576">2.2</a>
added two more.  Through all of this history, the <tt>read()</tt> and
<tt>write()</tt> members remained the way to read from and write to a file
descriptor, though their prototypes changed somewhat.
<p>
<h4>The plot thickens</h4>
<p>
The 2.4 release, made at the beginning of 2001, included <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.4.0/source/include/linux/fs.h#L773">a
version of <tt>struct file_operations</tt></a> with these new members:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*readv) (struct file *, const struct iovec *, unsigned long, loff_t *);
    ssize_t (*writev) (struct file *, const struct iovec *, unsigned long, loff_t *);
</pre>
<p>
User-space developers often needed the ability to perform scatter/gather
I/O — operations involving multiple segments of memory that needed to be
transferred in a single operation.  In response, the kernel gained support
for <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"><tt>readv()</tt>
and <tt>writev()</tt></a> but, to properly support these system calls, the
kernel needed to pass them down to the underlying implementations.  The new
members, which took an array of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.4.0/source/include/linux/uio.h#L16"><tt>iovec</tt>
structures</a> containing an address (in user space) and size for each
segment, were added for this purpose.  For device drivers or filesystems
that did not implement the new functions, the kernel would emulate them
with a series of <tt>read()</tt> or <tt>write()</tt> calls instead.
<p>
Subsequent work added many more members to <tt>struct file_operations</tt>,
including other variants of <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>.
<tt>aio_read()</tt> and <tt>aio_write()</tt>, used to implement the
kernel's somewhat unloved <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/io_submit.2.html">asynchronous
I/O mechanism</a>, went into the 2.5.33 development release.
<tt>splice_read()</tt> and <tt>splice_write()</tt>, implementing the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html"><tt>splice()</tt></a>
system call, were <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5274f052e7b">added</a> for 2.6.17.
Removals of <tt>file_operations</tt> members, like the removal of kernel
code in general, was rare, but <tt>readv()</tt> and <tt>writev()</tt> were
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ee0b3e671baf">removed in 2.6.19</a>
after all users were switched to use <tt>aio_read()</tt> and
<tt>aio_write()</tt> instead.
<p>
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.16/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1456">3.16
version of <tt>struct file_operations</tt></a>, had grown to
27&nbsp;members, including these additions indicating a new approach to I/O
within the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*read_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *);
    ssize_t (*write_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *);
</pre>
<p>
Increasingly, I/O operations were being initiated from the kernel, not just
from from user space; they often involved multiple segments and needed to
be executed asynchronously.  The data buffers involved could be referenced
in a number of ways.  The <tt>iov_iter</tt> structure used to describe
these more complex I/O operations <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.16/source/include/linux/uio.h#L22">looked
like this</a> at the time:
<p>
<pre>
    struct iov_iter {
	int type;
	size_t iov_offset;
	size_t count;
	union {
	    const struct iovec *iov;
	    const struct bio_vec *bvec;
	};
	unsigned long nr_segs;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The key distinguishing feature of this structure is related to the
<tt>type</tt> field.  If it was <tt>ITER_IOVEC</tt>, then the <tt>iov</tt>
union member contained an array of segments using user-space addresses.  If
it was, instead, <tt>ITER_KVEC</tt>, then the addresses were in kernel
space.  And if <tt>type</tt> was <tt>ITER_BVEC</tt>, then the <tt>bvec</tt>
field pointed to an array of <tt>bio</tt> structures (used to describe
block I/O requests).  An I/O API defined in this way could be called from a
number of contexts and would work regardless of whether the operation was
initiated from user space or from within the kernel.
<p>
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.16/source/include/linux/aio.h#L17"><tt>kiocb</tt>
structure</a> is used by the kernel to coordinate asynchronous I/O
operations.  Drivers are not required to implement asynchronous I/O (though
they may not perform as well if they don't), but if they do implement it,
they need the information in this structure.  The use of <tt>struct
kiocb</tt> reflects the fact that, among other goals, the new methods were
intended to replace <tt>aio_read()</tt> and <tt>aio_write()</tt>, which
were duly <a href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/8436318205b9">removed</a>
for the 4.0 release.
<p>
<h4><tt>struct iov_iter</tt> everywhere</h4>
<p>
Over time, <tt>struct iov_iter</tt> has evolved and become rather more
complex; see <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.8/source/include/linux/uio.h#L22">the
6.8 version</a> for the details.  The kernel has also accumulated a set of
helpers that free code from dealing with that complexity much of the time.
Meanwhile, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.8/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1983"><tt>struct
file_operations</tt> in 6.8</a> is up to 32 callable members.  But, through
all of this change, <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> have remained
essentially unchanged, even though they only handle the simplest of I/O
operations in what has become a complicated world.
<p>
Axboe has decided that, perhaps, those two members have reached the end of
their useful life:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	10 years ago we added -&gt;read_iter() and -&gt;write_iter() to struct
	file_operations. These are great, as they pass in an iov_iter
	rather than a user buffer + length, and they also take a struct
	kiocb rather than just a file. Since then we've had two paths for
	any read or write - one legacy one that can't do per-IO hints like
	"This read should be non-blocking", they strictly only work with
	O_NONBLOCK on the file, and a newer one that supports everything
	the old path does and a bunch more.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since <tt>read_iter()</tt> and <tt>write_iter()</tt> can do everything that
<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> can do, it makes sense to simply
remove the older members.  The only problem is, of course, there is a lot
of code that only implements <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> in the
kernel; much of it is in drivers that may not have seen significant
development (or even use) in years.  Some of them surely are being used,
though, and breaking them would undoubtedly increase the (already high) level of
grumpiness on the net.
<p>
Many modules that use the older interface can, with some effort, be
converted to use <tt>read_iter()</tt> and <tt>write_iter()</tt> instead,
perhaps gaining functionality in the process.  But there are a <i>lot</i>
of these modules, and trying to understand every one of them well enough to
do such a conversion is a path to madness, with little benefit.  So,
instead, Axboe started by implementing <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240411153126.16201-4-axboe@kernel.dk/">a set of
helpers</a> that emulates the new functions with a series of calls to
<tt>read()</tt> or <tt>write()</tt>; that minimizes the amount of change to
any given module while maximizing the chances that the results will be
correct.  See <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240411153126.16201-18-axboe@kernel.dk/">this
patch</a> as an example of what the simplest conversions look like.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240411153126.16201-438-axboe@kernel.dk/">final
patch</a> in the series removes <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> with a
surprising lack of ceremony, given that they have been there for
32&nbsp;years.
<p>
There have not been a lot of comments on the series; perhaps many
developers are still waiting for the whole thing to download into their
inboxes.  Al Viro <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240412042910.GK2118490@ZenIV/">noted</a> that some
of the conversions might need to be done a bit more carefully.  But nobody has
objected to the overall concept, thus far.
<p>
For a series like this to be accepted, it will need to be split into more
manageable chunks — which Axboe acknowledged at the outset.  This set of
changes does simplify the kernel, though, and it removes a fair amount of
old code, so chances are that it will happen in some form, sooner or later.
At that point, there will likely be a lot of out-of-tree modules that will
need to be updated before they can be built on newer kernels.  The good
news is that developers can make those changes now and get ahead of the
game.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Such patch series was sent only to LKML (and without a cover letter), meaning that neither driver maintainers nor driver mailing lists were notified. That's the case, for instance, of media, where patches sent to linux-media at vger are monitored via patchwork.linuxtv.org.<br>

It was only sent with a limited scope since a) the full series only makes sense to see the full picture, actual patches will be sent separately, and b) it's a simplistic RFC where even things like commit messages aren't fully done yet.

There are handful list of files toched by that patch bomb that I'm interested in reviewing, but the series neglected MAINTAINERS records. And there are questionable changes as well (like bloating up fs.h with yet another header and hence adding into dependency hell). Thanks to LWN coverage to get known about this activity...<br>

Al Viro's comment seems like a good topic for an article; there are files for which two separate write operations in a row has a different effect from a single write with the combined buffer, and there's something userspace can do that would come out differently with this series. I couldn't tell whether it was a single write getting split or multiple writes getting combined, but there's an interesting subtlety there.<br>

It's a single writev getting split to multiple calls to th3 .write member of the file_operations struct.<br>

To be specific, the original code for drivers without .write_iter would call .write multiple times for writev (in do_loop_readv_writev), but some of the patches (e.g. #39, which Viro points out) provide a .write_iter that combines them. I couldn't find any documentation that writev is supposed to be a batch of multiple operations (without any interleaved other operations from other tasks) rather than one operation with a pasted buffer, if it matters.<br>

      <p>This could be unrelated, but the <tt>N_HDLC</tt> line discipline for TTYs used to ensure that write boundaries were preserved.  If you did a write followed by another write followed by a read, the read would only get what the first write wrote, and you need to do a second read to get what the second write wrote.  In other words, it preserved frame boundaries.

<p>This was broken sometime between 4.19 and 5.11 as <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20240424173114.035ddd7b@gato.skoll.ca/T/">I reported</a>.

v4.19..v5.11 is a quite big range to say anything about that. You need to bisect.<br>

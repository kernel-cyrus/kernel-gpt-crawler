<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-flow
integrity</a> (CFI) is a technique used to reduce the ability to
redirect the execution of a program's code in attacker-specified ways.  The
Clang compiler has some features that can assist in maintaining
control-flow integrity, which have been applied to the Android kernel.  Kees
Cook gave a talk about CFI for the Linux kernel at the recently concluded
<a href="https://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a> in Gold Coast, Australia.
</p>

<p>
Cook said that he thinks about CFI as a way to reduce the attack, or
exploit, surface of the kernel.  Most compromises of the kernel involve an
attacker gaining execution control, typically using some kind of write flaw
to change system memory.  These write flaws come in many flavors,
generally with some restrictions (e.g. can only write a single zero or only
a set of fixed byte values), but in the worst case, they can be a "write
anything anywhere at any time" flaw.  The latter, thankfully, is relatively rare.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
A historical attack model was to simply write to regions of the running
code, which was used by "ancient rootkits and [...] anti-virus software,
which were indistinguishable from rootkits".   For that kind of attack to
work, the target must have both executable and writable memory permissions.
User space can 
write and execute anywhere in its address space, but it cannot write into that
portion reserved for kernel space.  A
write flaw in the kernel would effectively allow user space to write into
kernel memory, however.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/810083/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/lca-cook-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"
alt="[Kees Cook]" title="Kees Cook" width=217 height=270>
</a>

<p>
That led to the no-execute (NX) bit being used to disallow execution in the data
portions of the kernel's address space; the portions of the address space for kernel
text modules were still executable, though.  That led to the idea
of making those parts read-only (RO) so that they were not both writable
and executable, which is what was needed for an exploit of that sort.
</p>

<p>
But that still left all of user space that could be both written to and
executed from via a kernel exploit.  That led to using the Intel supervisor mode
execution prevention (SMEP) and ARM privileged execute never (PXN) features
to restrict the kernel from executing user-space memory (while in kernel
mode).  That closed off any place that would be both writable and
executable.  All of those protections make up "the last century of
defenses", he said.
</p>

<p>
So, thinking as an attacker, what can be done within those constraints?
One possibility is to use addresses stored in memory; by overwriting those
addresses, an attacker can control which code is executed.  The most common
place to do so is by  manipulating 
return addresses on the stack, which is what <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">return-oriented
programming</a> (ROP) attacks do.
</p>

<p>
Function pointers are used for indirect function calls, which are different
than direct function calls because the address of the call site is not
stored in the (non-writable) kernel text.  Instead, the address for the
call site is fetched from memory, placed into a register, and the call is
made via that value.  If an attacker can change the memory, they can control
where the call actually ends up going.  That is the "forward edge"  of an
indirect call, while the return address on the stack is the "backward edge"
of the call.  Either can be used by an attacker to redirect the code flow.
</p>

<p>
The writable function pointers can only exist in the kernel's heap and
stack due to the earlier tightening of the access to the rest of memory.
Function pointers can be stored in the heap or on the stack.
It turns out that making the stack read-only "makes it very hard to use",
Cook said with a chuckle.  If an attacker can overwrite one of these
two edges, they can call any executable byte in the kernel, "which is a
gigantic exploitation surface".  
</p>

<h4>Enter CFI</h4>

<p>
The goal behind CFI is to try to ensure that indirect calls go to the
expected addresses and that the return addresses are not changed.  For the
forward edge, indirect function pointers need to be validated before the
call is made.  Function pointers can be categorized into "classes" based on
their prototype and return value; doing so allows restricting indirect
calls to functions in the same class as the original.  Hardware CFI
protections, such as Arm's <a href="/Articles/804982/">branch target
identification</a> (BTI), have poor granularity since they only force
indirect calls to go to the start of a function, which is not all that much
protection, he said.
</p>

<p>
The Clang compiler can ensure that calls are only made to functions in the
same class, which "narrows things quite a bit".  In order to do so, though,
Clang needs to use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization#WPO_and_LTO">link-time
optimization</a> (LTO) to get visibility across the whole kernel code
base.  Functions in the same class are collected into jump tables that are
checked at runtime before an indirect call is made.  Cook's <a
href="https://outflux.net/slides/2020/lca/cfi.pdf">slides [PDF]</a> have
detailed examples of how that all works.
</p>

<p>
There is sometimes a bit of a performance hit from doing the validation, he
said, but it is "not terrible".  The Clang method works well enough, but
there are other implementation ideas out there.  The <a
href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/PaXTeam-H2HC15-RAP-RIP-ROP.pdf">Reuse
Attack Protector [PDF]</a> (RAP) technique from PaX Team is a "clever idea" that
uses hash values in the kernel text at function entry and exits, then
checks those values by reading them from the kernel text.  It is not
compatible with execute-only memory (i.e. memory that cannot be read, just
executed from), which is coming.
</p>

<p>
Another mechanism is the (as yet unreleased) <a
href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-17/materials/asia-17-Moreira-Drop-The-Rop-Fine-Grained-Control-Flow-Integrity-For-The-Linux-Kernel-wp.pdf">kCFI
[PDF]</a>; it makes a second pass to determine which functions are
legitimately reachable from call sites.  The idea is to further reduce the
exploitability surface of having multiple functions all in the same class.
For example, there are many kernel functions with a
"<tt>void&nbsp;foo(void)</tt>" signature.  The Android kernel team <a
href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/control-flow-integrity-in-android-kernel.html">looked
at the targets for indirect calls</a> and found that 55% have five or less
targets—but 7% have more than 100.
</p>

<h4>Backward edge</h4>

<p>
For the backward edge, some kind of trusted stack (e.g. a shadow call
stack) to contain the return addresses is needed.  It looks like that is best done in hardware
(e.g. Intel's <a href="/Articles/758245/">Control-Flow Enforcement
Technology</a> (CET) and Arm's <a href="/Articles/718888/">pointer
authentication</a>), but the hardware support is not there yet, so software
versions are needed.
</p>

<p>
The x86 version of shadow stacks in Clang was slow and there were some race
conditions, so it was removed, but the picture for Arm is better.  A single
register is reserved for Arm processors to be used for shadow-stack
operations; its value is not stored on the regular stack to avoid revealing
the location of the shadow stack.  Only the return addresses are pushed
onto the shadow stack, but they are also still pushed onto the regular
stack so that call-stack unwinders and the like will continue to work.  Before
the return from a function, the shadow stack value is popped and used.
</p>

<p>
The need to keep the location of the shadow stack secret makes that
solution less than perfect; the hardware solutions will be much better.
For Intel CET, there is no change needed in the generated assembly code,
though the shadow stack will need to be set up by the language runtime;
calls and returns will automatically use the otherwise-read-only stack.
For Arm pointer authentication, addresses will need to be signed using the
<tt>-msign-return-address</tt> option (for both Clang and GCC) and two new
instructions (<tt>paciasp</tt> and <tt>autiasp</tt>) will be needed at
entry and before return instructions.
</p>

<p>
The Pixel 3 and later Android phones are using CFI; forward-edge
protection was added in Q3 2018 and backward-edge protection in Q3 2019.
The code is also in the Android common kernel.  The Android compatibility
definition strongly recommends the use of these features; strong
recommendations typically become requirements for the next Android release,
he noted.
</p>

<p>
There were a number of "gotchas" in trying to make this all work.  For one
thing, using LTO requires a huge amount of memory and CPU, which resulted
in "massive linking times".  There is a ThinLTO mode for Clang, however,
which does less analysis but, once a few bugs were fixed, worked for CFI;
"now the linking times are not egregious, just slow".  Clang would only
build the jump tables for C functions, but the kernel has lots of assembly
language functions (e.g. cryptographic algorithms), so Clang needed to be
extended to build jump-table entries for all <tt>extern</tt> functions as well.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, relative addresses that are calculated as a delta from the
actual function address, which are used by the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/exception-tables.html">kernel
exception tables</a> for user-space accesses, would fail
because the address did not appear in the jump tables.  The exception
tables are hard-coded, however, so the CFI checks were simply disabled when
jumping to those relative addresses.
Ftrace uses linker aliases in a way that confused the CFI checks, but 
different linker aliases can be added to fix them.  In addition,
<a href="/Articles/752621/">kernel-page-table isolation</a> (KPTI), which
was added to deal with Meltdown, 
ensures that only a small entry stub for the kernel was mapped for user-space
programs, but the jump tables are also needed by that entry stub, so they had to be added to the
regions mapped under KPTI.
</p>

<h4>Upstreaming</h4>

<p>
He is cautiously optimistic ("fingers crossed") that all of the needed
changes in Clang to build Linux will be in the upcoming LLVM&nbsp;10
release.  While it is not related to CFI, the "asm goto" feature was needed
in Clang in order to build x86 kernels; he wants CFI to be available for as
many Linux targets as possible and "it turns out that x86 has a rather
large installed base".
</p>

<p>
On the kernel side, the Clang shadow-call-stack support is separable from
other dependencies and is expected to be added in the&nbsp;5.6 merge
window.  In order to support forward-edge CFI, the function prototypes need
to be correct for all of the indirect call sites, but there were a numbers
of places in the kernel where that was not true.  At this point, Arm has
all of those fixed,
but there is one remaining patch to correct a prototype for x86.
</p>

<p>
Adding LTO support is mostly just changes to the build scripts; it is all
working, but it needs to get upstream.  There were a lot of small details
that needed to be worked out and agreed upon; he is hoping that all of
those are settled now so that LTO can be merged. The actual forward-edge
CFI support requires LTO; he is hoping that the CFI piece "is entirely uncontroversial,
which is 
never true".  In any case, he is optimistic for inclusion in the&nbsp;5.7
or&nbsp;5.8 kernel.
</p>

<p>
There are some "do it yourself" instructions and links near the end of
Cook's slides.  All of the outstanding 50 or so patches are in a <a
href="https://github.com/samitolvanen/linux/tree/clang-cfi">GitHub
repository</a>.  One thing to keep in mind is that even when simply configuring
the kernel, the build scripts need to know what compiler and linker are
being used, so it is necessary to specify Clang and the LLVM linker on
the <tt>make</tt> command line ("<tt>CC=clang&nbsp;LD=ld.lld</tt>").
</p>

<p>
There are two modes for CFI; <tt>CONFIG_CFI_PERMISSIVE</tt> is effectively
the debug version of CFI, it will simply warn of CFI problems and continue
running.  If it is not set to permissive mode, either the kernel will panic
or the thread will be killed depending on the type of CFI failure and "how
it is set up internally".  That is only for forward-edge CFI failures, however; the
backward-edge failures are not reported currently as any changed return address is
just ignored and the correct value is used from the shadow stack.  That is
something he would like to see changed in future versions so that some kind
of warning would be provided.
</p>

<p>
In answer to a question, Cook said that the forward-edge CFI protection
works fine with <a
href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">retpolines</a> (which
is a Spectre mitigation), but he turned them off for his examples as it
just complicates the picture.  Hardware-based forward-edge CFI might make
retpolines impossible, but he is hopeful that retpolines will become
unnecessary well before some new scheme for CFI makes its appearance.
While ROP attacks target places other than function entry, most other
attacks are calling functions "normally", so the restriction that is
provided by today's hardware CFI is not terribly useful, he said.

      I didn't cover the DSO support in Clang's CFI implementation just because things were already pretty complex and I wasn't going to have time to cover everything. The short version is: when a function is not found in the jump table in the main kernel text, it is redirected to a <strong>__cfi_check()</strong> function exported by modules, and the jump tables are effectively "extended" for each function prototype bucket. More details are <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrityDesign.html">here</a> under the "Shared library support" heading.

Can anyone share more information about the executable-pages only functionality which as mentioned is coming? Is this Intel processors or maybe ARM as well? <br>
<p>
This is going to be a main hit against memory disclosure then exploit attacks. There will be maybe other information leaks like Meltdown and Spectre, but as far as I know they are painfully slow for collecting the data leak so preemptive defences can work then.<br>

Funny that you have said "Is this Intel processors or maybe ARM as well?"<br>

Intel is legacy novadays. ARM supports execute-only memory already (although not sure if it's ARM64 thingie or ARM32 works, too), even if software is not quite there. Not sure about Intel.<br>

ARM *did* support XO for user mode, but it was reverted because it defeated other hardening features.  I don’t know about kernel.<br>
<p>
x86 XO has prototype patches that require hypervisor assistance. If you’re lucky enough to have PKRU hardware (thanks, Intel, for coming up with all these server only features), then XO is emulated for user mode using PKRU.<br>

Thanks for the info.<br>
<p>
I have not found detailed information about this Intel mechanism, just an old email from 2015 but referring to a future functionality. Is that work what you refer to?<br>
<p>
If it was mentioned "it is coming", maybe it is something re-started by Intel or ARM improving the current support. Good to know anyway.<br>

There are two mechanisms.<br>
<p>
The EPT one takes advantage of the fact that EPT allows a host-physical-to-guest-physical mapping to be execute only.  By duplicating the entire guest physical space, a hypervisor can effectively repurpose a physical address bit in the guest pagetables as XO.  The only real snags are that an attempt to read XO memory results in an EPT violation instead of a page fault, resulting in some trickery, and that this technique doesn’t work at all on bare metal.  Patches for this exist. I don’t recall whether they’re applied yet.<br>
<p>
The other technique is that, if user code doesn’t ask for a specific protection key on a PKRU-capable system, the kernel will use a special key for XO memory and will program the PKRU register to disallow reads.  This is user-visible and awkward, but it works.<br>

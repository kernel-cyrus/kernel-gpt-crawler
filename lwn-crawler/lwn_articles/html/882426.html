<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 25, 2022</br>
           </div>
<p>
A few weeks back, we <a href="/Articles/880263/">looked</a> at a proposal
to add an integrity-management feature to Fedora.  One of the selling
points was that the integrity checking could be done using the PGP
signatures that are already embedded into the RPM package files that Fedora
uses.  But the kernel needs to be able to verify PGP signatures in order
for the Fedora feature to work.  That addition to the kernel has been proposed, but
some in the kernel-development community seem less than completely
enthusiastic about bringing PGP support into the kernel itself.
</p>

<p>
Roberto Sassu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220111180318.591029-1-roberto.sassu@huawei.com/">proposed</a>
the addition of support for PGP keys and signatures based on earlier work
by David Howells.  Sassu is also proposing the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210914163401.864635-1-roberto.sassu@huawei.com/">Digest
Lists Integrity Module</a> (DIGLIM) for the kernel and is the owner of the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DIGLIM">Fedora change
proposal</a> to support DIGLIM in the distribution.  That proposal was originally
targeting Fedora&nbsp;36, but it is not likely to be adopted for any Fedora
release until both DIGLIM and PGP support are upstream.
</p>

<h4>Parser</h4>

<p>
In order to handle the keys and signatures, though, there is a need for the
kernel to understand the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880">PGP format</a>,
so Sassu proposed putting a parser into the kernel.  As might be guessed, that
drew complaints; Maciej S. Szmigiero <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ab29dd6f-1301-e012-8898-9c739ca511a3@maciej.szmigiero.name/">wondered</a>
if there was a better way:
<blockquote class="bq">
Aren't PGP keys simply RSA / ECC / EdDSA keys with additional metadata?
Can't they be unwrapped from their (complex) PGP format in userspace and
loaded raw into the kernel, in a similar way as they are sometimes used
for SSH authentication?
<p>
This will save us from having to add complex parsers (a well-known source
of bugs) into the kernel [...]
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Sassu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/b37f9c0e9bf941f0b778c6949538835d@huawei.com/">said</a>
that Howells had already implemented a parser that follows the RFC for PGP
data; unwrapping it into another format still requires a parser of some
kind.  In addition, that code has been tested in several different ways:
<blockquote class="bq">
I extensively tested the implementation with an ad-hoc fault injector,
to see if the code can correctly handle errors. I also developed a
fuzzer to corrupt the data before it is read by the kernel. Finally,
I checked that there are not memory leaks. But I agree, there could
still be bugs.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, an "<q>in-kernel PGP Web of Trust</q>", as Szmigiero asked about, would
be available to a limited extent, Sassu said.  Certain kernel keyrings,
such as the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/">Integrity Measurement
Architecture</a> (IMA) keyring,
require that keys being added to them are vouched for by another key on the
kernel keyrings; support for checking the PGP signature on a key and
rejecting the key if the check fails is part of what Sassu has implemented in the
patch set.
</p>

<p>
But Szmigiero was still <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ab3d2bda-a704-f5d3-adee-e52b7d0a4641@maciej.szmigiero.name/">concerned</a>
about an in-kernel parser:
<blockquote class="bq">
A parser in userspace is preferred to one in kernel since if there is
a bug somewhere its consequences are much less severe.
And experience shows that parsers are especially prone to bugs.
A userspace implementation can also be tightly sandboxed for extra
security.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He also pointed out that there are existing user-space parsers for OpenPGP
that could be used, but Sassu does not see that path as less worrisome:
<blockquote class="bq">
However, it does not seem to me less
risky to define a new format to upload the RSA key and the signature
to avoid the complexity of PGP. Also, it does not seem more
complex than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_7">PKCS#7</a>,
which is already in the kernel. 
<p>[...] Another concern that I have is that, the approach of using an
OpenPGP library still requires the Linux distribution vendors to
do a transformation from the source data they have to another
format. They have anyway to certify this transformation, even
if it is done in user space. Maybe it is easier to keep the original
data and verify the minimum necessary to handle PGP keys and
signature in the kernel, rather than verifying a library running
in user space with many other functions.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>PGP deprecated?</h4>

<p>
Jason A. Donenfeld had a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YeV+jkGg6mpQdRID@zx2c4.com/">more fundamental
concern</a> about adding PGP support to the kernel at all. "<q>The
general consensus in the crypto engineering world is 
that PGP ought to be on its way out.</q>"  He pointed to a <a
href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">2019
blog post</a> as an example of the breadth of problems with PGP (and the
applications that implement it, such as <a
href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>).  He suggested using an <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA">Ed25519</a>-based signature
mechanism with something like <a
href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">Minisign</a> or <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify</a> in user space, and having only
minimal code in the kernel; that would have "<q>very few moving parts to
break</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
But James Bottomley <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/d92912bba61ee37e42d04b64073b9031604acc0f.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">disagreed</a>;
while there are legions of PGP detractors, "<q>no-one's actually been
able to come up with a more usable replacement</q>".  Beyond that,
Ed25519 is not supported by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted
Platform Module</a> (TPM) and might never be; by the time the TPM standards
organization adds new algorithms, it might skip over Ed25519 for something
stronger. He said that the crypto community often wants minimal
solutions, but those have "<q>only a relatively small
set of possible use cases and no future proofing</q>", while more
extensible solutions that are more complex get criticized "<q>as
being a 'swiss army knife'</q>"
</p>

<p>
Antony Vennard <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/079f10b9-060b-3a36-2224-fa1b483cbad5@vennard.ch/">thought</a>
that was the wrong way to look at things, though.  There is already support
for 
PKCS&nbsp;#7 in the kernel, adding PGP support further complicates things:
<blockquote class="bq">
We already have one
extensible system that is complicated in the kernel. This patch proposes to
add a second one achieving the same purpose instead of a userspace solution
to take advantage of the existing code, which I think would be preferable
and safer.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Sassu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f42065e2f52a4939b379a8453369aa7b@huawei.com/">replied</a>
that there are still barriers to the use of alternative mechanisms; whatever
key format is adopted will still need some kind of parser and a way to verify
signatures on the keys that will need to be present in the kernel.  He has
considered the problems and believes his approach achieves the right
balance:
<blockquote class="bq">
After several iterations, trying to remove anything that was not
essential from the patch set, I came to the conclusion that having
the logic for both the keys and the signatures was the best
compromise. True, it means more maintenance effort for the
kernel, but this ensures the best interoperability with the current
ecosystem.
<p>
I think the code is not particularly complicated that would be
impractical to review.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
 While the PGP format has lots of
different packet types, the in-kernel parser "<q>just needs to parse the
key, user ID and the signature packet and 
subpackets</q>", he said. The distribution ecosystem is one of his areas
of concern with switching to 
alternative solutions; "<q>I think that forcing all Linux distributions
to do it seems unrealistic</q>".  But if a minimal PGP parser could be
 vetted, the distribution's use cases would be supported:
 <blockquote class="bq">
Parsing data in the PGP format seems to be the only barrier. Once we
are confident that we parse this small number of packets correctly, the
rest is just reusing the mechanisms already in place. And we make it
easier for people to adopt security features.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He elaborated further on the distribution side of the puzzle in a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/887a1e46cd6f4c02a6530a15f00e8eb8@huawei.com/">reply</a>
to Donenfeld.  Switching to another package-signing mechanism (based on
Ed25519 as Donenfeld suggested, say) would require an enormous shift for
the distributions, which would likely take years to accomplish:
<blockquote class="bq">
More specifically, the first task would be to modify how
RPMs are signed (and thus how they are verified). The second
task would be to have a different way to certify the public key.
Lastly, Linux distribution vendors would have to change their
building infrastructure to use the new certified key, a new
version of the rpm package manager which takes as input
the new key, produces a different type of signature and embeds
it in the RPM header.
<p>[...]
The aim of this patch set is to make some security features
available in a short time, by significantly reducing the burden
of Linux distribution vendors for managing those security
features.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Donenfeld sympathized with the situation for distributions, but <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHmME9pMEJxGzmetDu0Bkf1=fqb+BHGQ3-6NB3hhtRjLWHm1cA@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>
that it comes down to short-term versus long-term thinking; instead of
putting a lot of work into a transition to a better scheme (which requires
"<q>evaluating *what* the better thing would be</q>"), continuing to
support a flawed (but functioning) system is an easier path forward.  He
wondered if that kind of thinking needed to come to a halt, at least for
PGP:
<blockquote class="bq">
I don't have a whole lot _technical_ to say about long term vs short
term thinking, but it does strike me that PGP is one of these cases
where people have known about the flaws for decades, but the ecosystem
keeps being extended because people continue to go with the short term
solutions, one by one, and now they've wound up here, at the doorstep
of the kernel. Maybe if at some point somebody puts down the foot and
says, "the road of short term intentions stops here," there might
gradually be impetus toward looking into long term solutions, e.g.
viable PGP replacements? Just a thought.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
While Ed25519 might be attractive, Konstantin Ryabitsev <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220117165933.l3762ppcbj5jxicc@meerkat.local/">said</a>,
its key management leaves something to be desired:
<blockquote class="bq">
I am concerned that ed25519 private key management is very rudimentary -- more
often than not it is just kept somewhere on disk, often without any passphrase
encryption.
<p>
With all its legacy warts, GnuPG at least has decent support for hardware
off-load via OpenPGP smartcards or TPM integration in GnuPG 2.3, but the best
we have with ed25519 is passhprase protection as implemented in minisign (and
even that is rudimentary -- if you need to sign 10 things, you will need to
type in your passphrase 10 times, as there is no passphrase agent of any
kind).
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He said that the <a
href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/02/openssh-fido-security-keys.html">integration</a>
of support for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> into <a
href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> is the "<q>most promising
non-PGP development of PKI [public-key infrastructure] signatures that I've
seen lately</q>".  Key management has been a known weakness for many of the
public-key signature schemes over the years. which makes him "<q>worried
that it's going to result in a net loss in overall security</q>". 
</p>

<p>
It is less than clear where this proposal will lead at this point.  The
kernel is the obvious "trusted" place to store keys and verifying
signatures made with those keys is a logical extension of that.  But the
resistance, both to PGP and to another in-kernel parser for a complicated
format, may be too much to overcome.

<p>
The Extended Verification Module (EVM) extension to IMA protects sensitive inode data including the owner, group, mode, and sensitive xattrs. With that enabled, even if you did rename &quot;bash&quot; to &quot;sudo&quot; you couldn&#x27;t make it SUID without detection, and without SUID it&#x27;s just a shell by another name.<br>
<p>
The IMA overview whitepaper mentioned IMA-Appraisal-Directory-Extension which would cover filenames as well, but so far as I can tell it remains only an abstract proposal.<br>

As a desktop user I wonder if kernel-distro crypto friendship is still includes me or not. Distro has keys to trust, kernel has keys to trust, and all untrusted code is untrusted.<br>
<p>
If I run `gcc foo.c` is `a.out` still a trusted code or it&#x27;s now a second-class suspicious unsigned binary?<br>
<p>
Whilst I see the point of securing &#x27;installation&#x27;, loosing freedom (and friction-less access) to hacking everything (kernel and system binaries including) would be a big loss.<br>

      dm-verity requires the whole filesystem to be immutable. Fedora would like rpm to be able to modify the filesystem to install and update packages, so dm-verity isn't suitable. They <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/878281/">also considered fs-verity</a>, but if I understand correctly <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/880263/">that was decided against</a> because it would have required a lot of extra data to be added to RPM packages.

So... adding a lot of extra data to RPM packages is unacceptable, and changing RPM to add a new signature format is unacceptable, but adding a PGP parser to the kernel is acceptable, even though adding things with historically bad security records (like PGP parsers) to the kernel should obviously be the last resort security-wise because it&#x27;s privileged? I&#x27;m fairly sure making RPM packages a bit bigger cannot result in system compromises, but compromising the kernel would in effect invalidate every signature applied to every file on the disk, since in kernelspace you can do anything.<br>
<p>
There does seem to me to be some not terribly good reasoning going on here.<br>

I wonder when the Kernel is going to get a &quot;restricted kthread&quot;, something that can run kernel code but is sandboxed just as much (if not more) than userspace.  I guess eBPF is kinda like this.  So why not compile the parsers to run in an eBPF context where the only thing they have access to is the input and output buffers?<br>

We have such a concept.  It&#x27;s called &quot;userspace&quot;.  You&#x27;re asking for the kernel to create a process, map a small amount of text, the input &amp; output buffers into that process and start it running.  Not terribly hard, but might benefit from some syntactic sugar to make it easier.<br>

I&#x27;m probably missing some things here, but couldn&#x27;t the kernel instead check that the gpg binary matches some checksum, same thing for the gpg configuration and key store, and then RPM use that gpg binary with that configuration ?<br>

I think you&#x27;d have to check that the binary only links to trusted libraries and that the tool you used to get that information (say, `ldd`) is trusted (also recursively). Maybe using kernel code to get the DT_NEEDED would be sufficient, but then you still need to figure out what those references refer to at runtime. Is the ELF interpreter trusted?<br>

While fair, that means that `ld-linux.so` can&#x27;t necessarily be trusted since you need to verify what it will end up loading based on whatever logic is in effect. `LD_*` variables, skipping unloadable libraries (e.g., incompatible arch or ABI flags), and probably more things. Since `ldd` is all *I* would trust to actually get a reliable agreement, are we back to &quot;must be a static binary&quot;?<br>

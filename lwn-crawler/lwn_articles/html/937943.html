           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 13, 2023</br>
           </div>
The kernel-development process routinely absorbs large changes to
fundamental subsystems and still produces stable releases every nine or ten
weeks.  On occasion, though, the development community's luck runs out.
The <a href="/Articles/906852/">per-VMA locking work</a> that went into the
6.4 release is a case in point; it looked like a well-tested change that
improved page-fault scalability.  There turned out to be a few demons
hiding in that code, though, that made life difficult for early adopters of
the 6.4 kernel.
<p>
The <tt>mmap_lock</tt> controls access to a process's address space.  If a
process has a lot of things going on at the same time — a large number of
threads, for example — contention for the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> can become a
serious performance problem.  Handling page faults, which can involve
changing page-table entries or expanding a virtual memory area (VMA), has
traditionally required the <tt>mmap_lock</tt>, meaning that many threads
generating page faults concurrently can slow a process down.
<p>
Developers have been working for years to address this problem, often
pursuing one form or another of <a href="/Articles/730531/">speculative
page-fault handling</a>, where the work is done without the protection of
the lock.  If contention occurred during the handling of a fault, the
kernel would drop the work it had done before making it visible and start
over.  This work never got to the point of being merged, though.
Eventually, Suren Baghdasaryan's per-VMA locking work was merged instead.
Since a page fault happens within a specific VMA, handling it should really
only require serialized access to that one VMA rather than to the entire
address space.  Per-VMA locking is, thus, a finer-grained version of
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> that allows for more parallelism in the execution of
specific tasks.
<p>
After a few iterations, this work was pulled into the mainline during the
6.4 merge window.  Entry into the mainline tends to increase the amount of
testing a change is subject to, but none of that testing turned up any
problems with per-VMA locking, which saw no fixup changes during the
remainder of the 6.4 development cycle.  Per-VMA locking, it seemed, was a
done deal.
<p>
<h4>Trouble arises</h4>
<p>
A mainline kernel release gets even more testing, though.  The 6.4 release
happened on June&nbsp;25; it took four days for Jiri Slaby to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/dbdef34c-3a07-5951-e1ae-e9c6e3cdf51b@kernel.org/">report</a>
problems with the Go language build.  On July&nbsp;2, Jacob Young <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217624">reported</a>
"<q>frequent but random crashes</q>" and narrowed the problem down to a
simple test case that could reproduce it.  In both cases, investigation
quickly pointed a finger at the per-VMA locking work.  There were, it
seems, cases where unexpected concurrent access was corrupting data
structures within the kernel.
<p>
Random crashes and data corruption are not the sort of experience users are
looking for when they upgrade to a new "stable" kernel release.  For extra
fun, the <a href="/Articles/937377/">StackRot vulnerability</a> led to the
merging of some significant changes to how stack expansion is handled —
changes that had not seen public review and which were quickly shipped in
the <a href="/Articles/937080/">6.4.1</a> stable update.  That work
introduced another VMA-locking bug in 6.4 kernels, having added another
case that needed explicit serialization.
<p>
Baghdasaryan responded quickly to all of these problems, posting <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230703182150.2193578-1-surenb@google.com/">a patch</a>
to simply disable the feature until the problems were worked out.  That
patch needed some tweaking of its own, but it was never applied to the
mainline in any form.  Memory-management maintainer Andrew Morton <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230704091808.aa2ed3c11a5351d9bf217ac9@linux-foundation.org/">went
into</a> "<q>wait-a-few-days-mode</q>" in the hopes that a proper fix for
the problem would emerge.  Greg Kroah-Hartman, meanwhile, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/2023070509-undertow-pulverize-5adc@gregkh/">said</a>
that nothing could be done for the stable kernels until some patch landed
in the mainline kernel.  As a result, the 6.4 kernel lacked any sort of
workaround for this serious bug.
<p>
On July 5, Thorsten Leemhuis (working in his regression-tracking role) <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/7668c45a-70b1-dc2f-d0f5-c0e76ec17145@leemhuis.info/">wondered</a>
how long the wait would be, noting that the faster-moving community
distributions would already be starting to ship the 6.4 kernel.  Morton <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230705084906.22eee41e6e72da588fce5a48@linux-foundation.org/">answered</a>
that he would send the fixes that existed at the time, but that did not
actually happen for a few more days, leading Leemhuis to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/df1d7d39-56f3-699c-0d0f-fcc8774f182e@leemhuis.info/">think</a>
that he needs to start sounding the alarm more quickly on serious
regressions like this one.  Had he done so in this case, he thought, the
problem might have been addressed more quickly.

<p>
Morton sent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230708104658.927e647f75d55c4a5d99cbf5@linux-foundation.org/">a
patch series</a> to Linus Torvalds on July&nbsp;8 that included, among
other things, the disabling of per-VMA locking.  Torvalds, though, undid
that change when merging the set, because three other patches had gone
straight into the mainline by then:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c137381f71ae">The first one</a>
     added some locking to the new stack-expansion code, undoing the
     problem that had been introduced by the security fixes.
<li> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/33313a747e81">The next</a>
     ensures that newly created VMAs are locked before they are made
     visible to the rest of the kernel.  The problem fixed did not affect
     any released kernels, but it was a latent bug that would be exposed by
     the planned expansion of per-VMA locking in the future.
<li> Finally, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb49c455323f">this
     patch</a> fixed the problem that was being reported.  If a process
     called <tt>fork()</tt>, then incurred a page fault on a VMA while that
     VMA was being copied into the child process, the result could be the
     corruption of the VMA.  The fix is to explicitly lock each VMA before
     beginning the copy, slowing down <tt>fork()</tt>-heavy workloads by as
     much as&nbsp;5%.  </ul>
<p>
It's worth noting that Torvalds was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wi=+qS+5v_7mVxKWUSOKaxzC2V8N7hyFVt1qTWGM_pmAQ@mail.gmail.com/">opposed</a>
to the idea of disabling per-VMA locking; instead he insisted that, if it
could not be fixed, it should be removed entirely:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 I seriously believe that if the per-vma locking is so broken that
	 it needs to be disabled in a development kernel, we should just
	 admit failure, and revert it all.
<p>
	 And not in a "revert it for a later attempt" kind of way.
<p>
	 So it would be a "revert it because it added insurmountable
	 problems that we couldn't figure out" thing that implies *not*
	 trying it again in that form at all, and much soul-searching
	 before somebody decides that they have a more maintainable model
	 for it all.
</blockquote>
<p>
By all appearances, the fixes (which were included in the <a
href="/Articles/937886/">6.4.3</a> stable update on July&nbsp;11) are
sufficient, and per-VMA locking is now stable.  There should, thus, be no
need to revert and soul-search in this case.  That said, it's worth keeping
in mind that this work looked stable before the 6.4 release as well.
<p>
<h4>Closing thoughts</h4>
<p>
The per-VMA locking work made fundamental changes to a core kernel
subsystem, moving some page-fault handling outside of a sprawling lock, the
coverage of which is probably not fully understood by anybody.  The fact
that it turned out to have some subtle bugs should not be especially
surprising.  It is hard to make this kind of change to the kernel without
running into trouble somewhere, but this is also precisely the sort of
change that developers need to be able to make if Linux is to adapt to
current needs.
<p>
In theory, avoiding subtle locking problems is one of the advantages of
using a language like Rust.  Whether, say, a VMA abstraction written in
Rust could truly ensure that accesses use proper locking while maintaining
performance has not yet been proven in the kernel context, though.
<p>
There is a case to be made that this regression could have been handled
better.  Perhaps there should be a way for an immediate "disable the
offending feature" patch to ship in a stable release, even if that change has
not gone into the mainline, and even if a better fix is expected in the
near future.  Kernel developers often make the point that the newest
kernels are the best ones that the community knows how to make and that
users should not hesitate to upgrade to them.  Responding more quickly when
an upgrade turns out to be a bad idea would help to build confidence in
that advice.
<p>
Meanwhile, though, developers did respond quickly to the problem and proper
fixes that allowed the feature to stay in place were found.  The number of
users exposed to the bug was, hopefully, relatively small.  There is, in
other words, a case to be made that this problem was handled reasonably
well and that we will all get the benefits of faster memory management as a
result of this work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Anecdote: Firefox began crashing occasionally (1-2x per day) when I switched to kernel 6.4.  Since I upgraded to 6.4.3 two days ago, it has not crashed.  I don't know for sure it was the kernel, but it seems likely.</p>

<p>
It seems so obvious that the truth of “newest is best” is more complicated than this (I’m not saying those involved don’t know this, just it helps me to say it directly).  The basic logic of it is obviously correct, but at the same time, it’s common that new things have new problems not yet found through greater exposure.  I don’t really have an answer, maybe it’s to hugely increase testing of kernels before they come out.  But it seems likely there will still be a sweet spot with stable kernels that are just a bit older base with more fixes, whatever we may say about the best we know how to produce. :/<br>

      <p>It's complicated. The newest kernel is, by definition, the best kernel the developers know how to produce, but that does not necessarily make it the best for your workload, because it may have new bugs that matter to you, while the old bugs don't matter to you.
<p>And one component of "please use the latest" is that bug reports become less valuable the longer the gap between bug introduced, and bug found; if you report a bug that's not present in 6.4, but is present in 6.5-rc1, not only are there fewer commits to consider that could possibly have exposed the bug, but the people who will fix your bug have the context around <em>why</em> something works the way it does in recent memory. If you report a bug as added in 5.12-rc1 and still present in 6.5-rc1, but not in 5.11, you're still keeping the commit count down, but now you're asking the developers to remember why changes were made in the 5.12 time frame, and what the intended effect was.

Wow. This bug would've made postgres extremely sad, and should've turned up reasonably quickly in a pgbench workload. <br>

Interesting that it got so far, given that postgres has been a useful tool to exercise other MM kernel issues in the past.<br>

I actually happened to run a bunch of postgres benchmarks on a vulnerable kernel, without, as far as I know it, encountering the issue. I suspect it's because postmaster just doesn't have a lot of page faults. <br>

The task calling fork() must be multithreaded to encounter this bug. Most multithreaded tasks don't call fork(). Most tasks that call fork() (including pgbench) are not multithreaded. It's not too surprising that it took months to be uncovered (that is, months since Suren started posting this patch series, not months since it was released in an official kernel).<br>

      The VM switch in 2.4 seemed insane at the time as well.  It <i>did</i> seem to stabilize a lot of the persistent problems that had been plaguing that kernel, though; it's been a long time since I've heard anybody who thinks it was the wrong decision.

Yeah, I can’t argue with the results.  That stood out but I was in fact talking as much about the whole process - the differing branches and the seeming lack of maintainers except Linus.  It feels a little like watching a kind of multi-mode high traffic near-chaos flow, the kind that seems - to someone used to orderly traffic -  like it should lead to constant crashes but somehow doesn’t (usually :x).<br>

Well, I think that such performance critical paths would either use safe code or they would be marked unsafe {} and use some lockless performance tricks.<br>
The unsafe-block by itself would probably help to raise some eyebrows when doing such fundamental locking changes.<br>

I'm not  sure rust would have helped here a lot. Rust is really good at enforcing ownership models and pretty flexible at that. But for that to work you need to understand your ownership model clearly, otherwise you can't encode it in the type system. And you need to encode it all yourself for custom data structure protection schemes like this one.<br>
<p>
I think in this case here it was more an issue of not clearly understanding the ownership model of vma structs, and not so much a missed case that the compiler could have spotted for you. Where rust might help is that it allows you to roll out the ownership model first (in the type system) without changing the locking, and then once you're fairly confident that you got it right, you flip the switch (and watch things blow up if you missed something).<br>

<p>
If you don't understand the ownership model, you can't write correct C code either. The resulting code may be correct by luck, at best.<br>

Exactly.<br>
Because it was not enforced and not even encouraged by the language to think about it.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;not so much a missed case that the compiler could have spotted for you.</span><br>
<p>
I'm not talking about that kind of thing.<br>
I'm talking about Rust encouraging you to think about ownership. This is many levels above a compiler run.<br>
Programming Rust puts your brain into a completely different mode of thinking. And that's what makes the real difference.<br>

An immediate idea to mitigate this: keep a process-global mmap lock until the first thread is created, switch to per-VMA locking only then.<br>
<p>
Is that workable?<br>
<p>
Many many standard Unix tools don’t use any threads at all, while the standard workflow uses loops and pipes and is therefore fork-heavy.<br>

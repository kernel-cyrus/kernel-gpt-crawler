           </div>
The kernel project has usually been willing to make fundamental internal
changes if they lead to a better kernel in the end.  The project also,
though, goes out of its way to avoid breaking interfaces that have been
exposed to user space, even if programs come to rely on behavior that was
never documented.  Sometimes, those two principles come into conflict,
leading to a situation where fixing problems within the kernel is either
difficult or impossible.  This sort of situation has been impeding
performance improvements in the kernel's POSIX timers implementation for
some time, but it appears that a solution has been found.
<p>
<h4>Timers and CRIU</h4>
<p>
The POSIX timers API allows a process to create its own private interval
timers based on any of the clocks provided by the kernel.  A process calls
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html"><tt>timer_create()</tt></a>
to create such a timer:
<p>
<pre>
    int timer_create(clockid_t clockid, struct sigevent *sevp, timer_t *id);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>id</tt> argument is a pointer to a location where the kernel can
return an ID used to identify the new timer; it is of type <tt>timer_t</tt>,
which maps eventually to an <tt>int</tt>.  Various other system calls
can use that ID to arm or disarm the timer, query its current status, or
delete it entirely.   The man page for <tt>timer_create()</tt>
indicates that each created timer will have an ID that is unique within the
creating process, but makes no other promises about the returned value.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
The "unique within the process" guarantee came with the 3.10 kernel release
in 2013; previously, the timer IDs were unique system-wide.  To understand
that change, one has to look at the <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace
(CRIU)</a> project, which has long worked on the ability to save the state
of a group of processes to persistent storage, then restore that group at a
future time, possibly on a different system.  Reconstructing the state of a
set of processes well enough that the processes themselves are not aware of
having been restored in this way is a challenging task; the CRIU developers
have often struggled to get all of the pieces working (and to keep them
that way).
<p>
POSIX timers were one of the places where they ran into trouble.  To
restore a process that is using timers, CRIU must be able to recreate the
timers with the same ID they had at checkpoint time, but the system-call
API provides no way to request a specific timer ID.  Even if such an
ability existed, though, the existence of a single, system-wide ID space
for timers was an insurmountable problem; CRIU might try to recreate a
timer for a process, only to find that some other, unrelated process in the
system already had a timer with that ID.  In such cases, the restore would
fail.
<p>
This problem was addressed with <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5ed67f05f66c">this patch</a> from
Pavel Emelyanov, which implemented a new hash table to store timer IDs.
That table was still global, but the timer IDs kept therein took the
identity of the owning process (specifically, the address of its <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.4/source/include/linux/sched/signal.h#L87"><tt>signal_struct</tt></a>
structure) into account, separating each process's timer IDs from all the
others.  At that point, the problem of ID collision when restoring a
process went away.
<p>
The other problem — the lack of a way to request a specific timer ID —
remained, though.  To address that problem, CRIU stuck with the approach it
had used before, which was based on some internal knowledge about how the
kernel allocates those IDs.  There is a simple, per-process counter,
starting at zero, that is used for timer IDs; that counter is incremented
every time a new timer is created.  So a series of <tt>timer_create()</tt>
calls will yield a predictable series of IDs, counting through the integer
space.  When CRIU must create a timer with a specific ID within a
to-be-restored process, it takes advantage of this knowledge and simply
runs a loop, allocating and destroying timers, until the requested ID is
returned.
<p>
If a process only creates a small number of timers in its lifetime, this
linear ID search will not take long.  Checkpointing, though, is often used
on long-running processes in order to save their state should something go
wrong partway through.  That kind of process, if it regularly creates and
destroys timers, can end up with IDs that are spread out widely in the
integer space.  That, in turn, means it can take a long time to land on the
needed ID at restore time.
<p>
<h4>Without a paddle</h4>
<p>
In 2023, Thomas Gleixner sent <a href="/ml/all/87ednpyyeo.ffs@tglx/">this
summary</a> in response to a timer bug report; he noted that in some cases,
the allocation loop "<q>will run for at least an hour to restore a single
timer</q>".  That is not the speedy restore operation that CRIU users may
have been hoping for.  But the real problem at the time was that the
requirement to allocate timer IDs sequentially in the kernel was getting in
the way of some needed changes to the internal global hash table, which, in
turn, were blocking other changes within the timer subsystem.  Since that
behavior could not be changed without breaking CRIU, Gleixner concluded
that the kernel was "<q>up the regression creek without a paddle</q>".
<p>
At the time, some possible solutions were considered.  Reducing the ID
space from <tt>0..INT_MAX</tt> to something smaller could speed the ID
search, but it would still be an ABI break; CRIU would no longer be able to
restore any process that had created timers with a larger ID.  A new system
call to create a timer with a given ID was another possibility but, due to
how the timer API works (and the <tt>sigevent</tt> structure it accepts),
the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the system call could not be made
compatible.  That would require the addition of another "compat" system
call, which is something the kernel developers have gone out of their way
to avoid for some time.  In the end, the conversation wound down with no
solution being found.
<p>
In mid-February 2025, networking developer Eric Dumazet posted <a
href="/ml/all/20250219125522.2535263-1-edumazet@google.com/">a patch
series</a> aimed at reducing locking contention in the kernel's timer code,
citing "<q>incidents involving gazillions of concurrent posix timers</q>".
That work elicited some testy responses from Gleixner, but there was no
questioning the existence of a real problem.  So Gleixner went off to
create <a href="/ml/all/20250302185753.311903554@linutronix.de">his own
patch series</a>, incorporating Dumazet's work, but then aiming to solve
the other problems as well.  Most of the series is focused on implementing
a new hash table that lacks the performance problems found in current
kernel; benchmark results included in the cover letter show that some
success was achieved on that front.
<p>
<h4>A better solution for CRIU</h4>
<p>
But then Gleixner set out to solve the CRIU problem as well.  Rather than
create a new system call to enable the creation of a timer with a specific
ID, though, he concluded that the <tt>id</tt> argument to
<tt>timer_create()</tt> could be used to provide that ID.  All that is
needed is a flag to tell <tt>timer_create()</tt> to use the provided value
rather than generating its own ... but <tt>timer_create()</tt> has no
<tt>flags</tt> argument.  So, if <tt>timer_create()</tt> is to gain the
ability to read a timer ID from user space, some other way needs to be
found to let it know that this behavior is requested.
<p>
The answer is a pair of new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
operations.  A call like this:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_TIMER_CREATE_RESTORE_IDS, PR_TIMER_CREATE_RESTORE_IDS_ON);
</pre>
<p>
will cause the calling process to enter a "timer restoration mode" that
causes <tt>timer_create()</tt> to read the requested timer ID from the
location pointed to by the <tt>id</tt> parameter passed from user space.
The special value <tt>TIMER_ANY_ID</tt> can provided in cases where user
space does not have an ID it would like to request.  Another
<tt>prctl()</tt> call with <tt>PR_TIMER_CREATE_RESTORE_IDS_OFF</tt> will
exit the restoration mode, causing any subsequent <tt>timer_create()</tt>
calls to generate an ID internally as usual.
<p>
This functionality is narrowly aimed at CRIU's needs.  Normally, adding
this kind of process-wide state would be an invitation for problems; some
distant thread could make a <tt>timer_create()</tt> call while the
restoration mode is enabled, but expecting the old behavior, and thus be
unpleasantly surprised.  But CRIU can use this mode at the special point
where the restarted processes have been created, but are not yet allowed to
resume running at the spot where they were checkpointed.  At that time,
CRIU is entirely in control and can manage the state properly.
<p>
Another important point is that the <tt>prctl()</tt> call will fail on an
older kernel that does not support the timer restoration mode.  When CRIU
sees that failure, it can go back to the old, brute-force method of
allocating timers.  The CRIU developers will thus be able to take advantage
of the new API while maintaining compatibility for users on older kernels.
<p>
One problem that will remain even after this series is merged is that the
sequential-allocation behavior of <tt>timer_create()</tt>, in the absence
of the new <tt>prctl()</tt> operation, is still part of the kernel's ABI.
The timer developers never meant to make that promise, but they are stuck
with it for as long as CRIU installations continue to depend on it.  The
good news is that updating CRIU will generally be necessary for users who
update their kernels anyway, since that is the only way to get support for
newer kernel features.  So, perhaps before too long, the
sequential-allocation guarantee for <tt>timer_create()</tt> can be retired
— unless some other user that depends on it emerges from the woodwork.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

timer_create was standardized in 1997, nearly 2 decades before including a flags argument in new syscalls became common in Linux.

Also, FWIW, I think you could add flags to timer_create via the clockid argument, the same way flags were added to the socket syscall, where SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK were defined to be OR'able into the type argument.<br>

Of course we could add a new syscall, but as explained by Jonathan that would require a compat syscall as well, which is what we really try to avoid. As the use case for this is very narrow, the prctl() turned out to be the least of all evils while maintaining full user space compatibility.<br>

I wonder why the extension to choose timerid was not stashed into the clockid parameter by setting a higher bit ? There is room, the constants for clockid are small integers. This would have kept the effect local.<br>

There is already a hack to put file descriptors in clockids; see "Dynamic clocks" section of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html</a><br>

There would still be room, since the clockid is a 32-bit value and file descriptors are never very large. The clock type values take the bottom 3 bits. If the sign bit is left alone, and we use bit 30 for the special flag, this still leaves 27 bits for the fd part, which is way more than enough.<br>

That wouldn't be a compatible interface. In the POSIX API, the timer_t *id pointer is write-only for the system call. It is fair to assume that it points to uninitialized memory, with any combination of bits set.<br>

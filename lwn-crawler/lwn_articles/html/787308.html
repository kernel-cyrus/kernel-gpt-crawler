<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 2, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
system call allows one process to handle page faults for another — in user
space.  Its original use case was to support transparent container
migration, but other uses have developed over the years.  At the 2019 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Andrea Arcangeli
described a scheme to <a href="/Articles/783571/">add write-protection
support</a> to <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>.  After a year of lost time fighting
speculative-execution problems, Arcangeli is about ready to move this feature
into the mainline.
<p>
The core idea behind <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> is that, when the process of
interest incurs a page fault due to a non-present page, the monitoring
process receives a notification and is given the opportunity to provide a
page to satisfy that fault.  Once pages are present, though, the monitoring
process is no longer involved.  The new proposal changes that by allowing
the monitoring process to mark pages as being write-protected, even though
the owning process has write permission to them.  That allows writes to be
intercepted, and some extra processing performed.
<p>
There are a number of use cases for this feature, Arcangeli said.  They
include:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Live snapshotting of running processes.  QEMU would like this feature
     so that it can be sure of copying pages in a stable state.
<li> The Redis database system performs checkpointing by forking, then
     writing out its memory in the child process, taking advantage of the
     kernel's copy-on-write behavior to keep the memory stable while it is
     being written.  Among other things, this
     technique requires disabling transparent huge pages in order to work,
     but that 
     has a performance impact.  It also potentially doubles memory use,
     since the parent could write to all of its data pages while the child is
     running.  The write-protect feature could eliminate the need to fork
     to get a stable set of pages to write.
<li> There are schemes for implementing distributed shared memory that
     could use it to detect (and distribute) changes.  This can, in theory,
     be done now by using <tt>mprotect()</tt> and handling
     segmentation-violation signals, but it's slow and creates vast numbers
     of virtual memory areas in the kernel.
<li> The <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/soft-dirty.txt">soft
     dirty feature</a>, used by the checkpoint-restore in user space (CRIU)
     mechanism, could be replaced by this write-protect mechanism.  It
     would be far more efficient, since it would eliminate the need to scan
     through the page tables.
<li> Similarly, it could be used to replace the dirty bits used by
     language runtime systems, such as the Java virtual machine, to catch
     changes.
</ul>
<p>
Many other cases that use <tt>mprotect()</tt> now would likely run faster
with <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>, which never needs to acquire the highly
contended <tt>mmap_sem</tt> lock for writes.
<p>
Processes wanting to use this feature must call <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> to
obtain a file descriptor, then perform an <tt>UFFDIO_REGISTER</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt> call with the <tt>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP</tt> option.
Then <tt>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT</tt> operations, which supply a start address

<a href="/Articles/787316/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/AndreaArcangeli-sm.jpg" alt="[Andrea
Arcangeli]" title="Andrea Arcangeli" class="lthumb"></a>

and a size, can be used to change the write-protect bit on one or more
pages.  Events will show up with the <tt>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP</tt> flag
set.  For now, write protection only works with anonymous pages.
<p>
There are some loose ends that still need to be worked out.  For example,
the write-protect feature requires a new bit in the page-table entries; it
has taken 
the last available bit for this purpose, which may not be entirely welcome.
Arcangeli said 
that it may be possible to find an alternative to using that bit later on.
Dave Hansen said that there might just be a couple of other bits available
if one looks hard enough, but Mel Gorman warned that they might not be
available on all architectures.  Some of the apparently unused bits have
been claimed by CPU vendors for uses that have not yet been made public, it
seems. 
<p>
Another issue is that page-fault handlers can fail with a
<tt>VM_FAULT_RETRY</tt> return code, indicating that the memory-management
subsystem should restart the process of handling the fault from the
beginning.  But that can only happen twice for any given fault before the
whole thing fails, sending a (probably fatal) signal to the faulting
process.  This is a problem for the write-protect feature, which can
generate more retries than that.  Ideally, an unlimited number of retries
would be allowed, Arcangeli said.
<p>
Currently privilege is required to use <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>, but the
desire is to make it available for unprivileged use as well; a sysctl knob
would be used to control whether privilege is needed or not, allowing "paranoid"
system administrators to restrict its use.  Jérôme Glisse suggested that
perhaps the seccomp mechanism would be a better way to control access to
this feature.
<p>
At the end of the session, Arcangeli asked whether the patches need more
review before being merged.  "Always" was the inevitable answer from
memory-management subsystem maintainer Andrew Morton.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why does it matter that the last available bit of the page table entry would be used? It's not something that needs to be backwards compatible, right? Besides a (very tiny?) bit of performance loss, what would be the argument against increasing it with a byte when the next feature comes around?<br>

Because the size (and structure) of page table entries is defined by the hardware. After all, the MMU has to be able to decode the entries when converting virtual to physical addresses. There are only a few bits that can be used by the operating system and that are ignored by the hardware.<br>

      The PTE format is defined by the hardware (on many architectures, at least); it's not something that can be readily extended.

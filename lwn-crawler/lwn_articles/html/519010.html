           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>October 10, 2012</br>
           </div>
<p> Loadable kernel modules provide a mechanism to dynamically modify the
functionality of a running system, by allowing code to be loaded and
unloaded from the kernel. Loading code into the kernel via a module has a
number of advantages over building a completely new monolithic kernel from
modified source code. The first of these is that loading a kernel module
does not require a system reboot. This means that new kernel functionally
can be added without disturbing users and applications.

<p> From a developer perspective, implementing new kernel functionality via
modules is faster: a slow "compile kernel, reboot, test" sequence in each
development iteration is instead replaced by a much faster "compile module,
load module, test" sequence. Employing modules can also save memory, since
code in a module can be loaded into memory only when it is actually
needed. Device drivers are often implemented as loadable modules for this
reason.

<p> From a security perspective, loadable modules also have a potential
downside: since a module has full access to kernel memory, it can
compromise the integrity of a system. Although modules can be loaded only
by privileged users, there are still potential security risks, since a
system administrator may be unable to directly verify the authenticity and
origin of a particular kernel module. Providing module-related
infrastructure to support administrators in that task is the subject of
ongoing effort, with one of the most notable pieces being the work to
support <a href="/Articles/515007/">module signing</a>. 

<p> Kees Cook has recently posted a series of patches that tackle another
facet of the module-verification problem. These patches add a new system
call for loading kernel modules. To understand why the new system call is
useful, we need to start by looking at the existing interface for loading
kernel modules.

<p> The Linux interface for loading kernel modules has had (since kernel
2.6.0) the following form:

<pre>
    int init_module(void *module_image, unsigned long len,
                    const char *param_values);
</pre>

<p> <!-- The <tt>init_module()</tt> system call loads a binary module image
into kernel space, performs symbol relocation for the new module,
initializes module's parameter, and then runs the module's <tt>init</tt>
function.--> The caller supplies the ELF image of the to-be-loaded module
via the memory buffer pointed to by <tt>module_image</tt>; <tt>len</tt>
specifies the size of that buffer.  (The <tt>param_values</tt> argument is
a string that can be used to specify initial values for the module's
parameters.)

<p> The main users of <tt>init_module()</tt> are the <tt>insmod</tt> and
<tt>modprobe</tt> commands.  However any privileged user-space application
(i.e., one with the <tt>CAP_SYS_MODULE</tt> capability) can load a module
in the same way that these commands do, via a three-step process: opening a
file that contains a suitably built ELF image, reading
or <tt>mmap()</tt>ing the file's contents into memory, and then calling
<tt>init_module()</tt>.

<p> However, this call sequence is the source of an itch for Kees.  Because
the step of obtaining a file descriptor for the image file is separated
from the module-loading step, the operating system loses the ability to
make deductions about the trustworthiness of the module based on its origin
in the filesystem. As Kees <a href="/Articles/514168/">said</a>:

<div class="BigQuote">

being able to reason about the origin of a kernel module would be valuable
in situations where an OS already trusts a specific file system, file, etc,
due to things like security labels or an existing root of trust to a
partition through things like <a href="/Articles/459420/">dm-verity</a>.

</div>

<p> His solution is fairly straightforward: remove the middle of the three
steps posted above. Instead, the application will open the file and pass
the returned file descriptor directly to the kernel as part of a new
module-loading system call; the kernel then performs the task of reading
the module image from the file as a precursor to loading the module.

<p> Although the concept of the solution is simple, it has been through a
few iterations, with the most notable changes being to details of the
user-space interface.  Kees's initial proposal was to hack the existing
<tt>init_module()</tt> interface, so that if <tt>NULL</tt> is passed in the
<tt>module_image</tt> argument, the kernel would interpret the <tt>len</tt>
argument as a file descriptor.  Rusty Russell, the kernel modules subsystem
maintainer, somewhat bluntly <a href="/Articles/519006/">suggested</a> that
a new system call would be a better approach, and on the <a
href="/Articles/519008">next revision</a> of the patch, H.&nbsp;Peter Anvin
<a href="/Articles/519004/">pointed out</a> that the system call would be
better named according to existing conventions, where the file descriptor
analog of an existing system call simply uses the same name as that system
call, but with an "f" prefix.  Thus, Kees has arrived at the <a
href="/Articles/519009">currently proposed</a> interface:

<pre>
    int finit_module(int fd, const char *param_values);
</pre>

<p> In the most recent patch, Kees, who works for Google on Chrome OS, has
also further elaborated on the motivations for adding this system call.
Specifically, in order to ensure the integrity of a user's system, the
Chrome OS developers would like to be able to enforce the restriction that
kernel modules are loaded only from the system's read-only,
cryptographically verified root filesystem. Since the developers already
trust the contents of the root filesystem, employing <a
href="/Articles/515007/">module signatures</a> to verify the contents of a
kernel module would require the addition of an unnecessary set of keys to
the kernel and would also slow down module loading. All that Chrome OS
requires is a light-weight mechanism for verifying that the module image
originates from that filesystem, and the new system call provides just that
facility.

<p> Kees pointed out that the new system call also has potential for wider
use. For example, Linux Security Modules (LSMs) could use it to examine
digital signatures contained in the module file's extended attributes (the
file descriptor provides the kernel with the route to access the extended
attributes). During discussion of the patches, interest in the new system
call was confirmed by the maintainers of the <a
href="/Articles/137306/">IMA</a> and <a
href="/Articles/353837/">AppArmor</a> kernel subsystems.

<p> At this stage, there appear to be few roadblocks to getting this system
call into the kernel. The only question is when it will arrive. Kees would
very much like to see the patches go into the currently open 3.7 merge
window, but for <a href="/Articles/519027/">various reasons</a>, it appears
probable that they will only be merged in Linux 3.8.

<p> <i>Update, January 2013:</i> <tt>finit_module()</tt> was indeed merged
in Linux 3.8, but with a changed API that added a <tt>flags</tt> argument
that can be used to modify the behavior of the system call. Details can be
found in the manual page.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Well, not really.  For one reason, only: they were too late.<br>
<p>
The patches were posted one week before *Linus's* merge window, which is generally considered the close of subtree merge windows.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

Speaking of init_module(), does anyone know why its man page shows a completely different signature (which also requires much more to be done in user space)?<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 19, 2013</br>
           </div>
Our recent coverage of the <a href="/Articles/552904/">multiqueue block
layer work</a> touched on a number of the changes needed to enable the
kernel to support devices capable of handling millions of I/O operations
per second.  But, needless to say, there are plenty of additional details
that must be handled.  One of them, the allocation of integer tags to
identify I/O requests, seems like a relatively small issue, but it has led
to an extensive discussion that, in many 
ways, typifies how kernel developers look at proposed additions.
<p>
Solid-state storage devices will only achieve their claimed I/O rates if
the kernel issues many I/O operations in parallel.  That allows the device
to execute the requests in an optimal order and to exploit the parallelism
inherent in having multiple banks of flash storage.  If the kernel is not
to get confused, though, there must be a way for the device to report the
status of specific operations to the kernel; that is done by assigning a tag
(a small integer value) to each request.  Once that is done, the device can
report that, say, request #42 completed, and the kernel will know which
operation is done.
<p>
If the device is handling vast numbers of operations per second, the kernel
will somehow have to come up with an equal number of tags.  That suggests
that tag allocation must be a fast operation; even a small amount of
overhead starts to really hurt when it is repeated millions of times every
second.  To that end, Kent Overstreet has proposed the merging of a <a
href="/Articles/554097/">per-CPU tag allocator</a>, a new module with a
simple task: allocate unique integers within a given range as quickly as
possible.
<p>
The interface is relatively straightforward.  A "tag pool," from which tags
will be allocated, can be declared this way:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/percpu-tags.h&gt;

    struct percpu_tag_pool pool;
</pre>
<p>
Initialization is then done with:
<p>
<pre>
    int percpu_tag_pool_init(struct percpu_tag_pool *pool, unsigned long nr_tags);
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>nr_tags</tt> is the number of tags to be contained within the
pool.  Upon successful initialization, zero will be returned to the
caller.
<p>
The actual allocation and freeing of tags is managed with:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned percpu_tag_alloc(struct percpu_tag_pool *pool, gfp_t gfp);
    void percpu_tag_free(struct percpu_tag_pool *pool, unsigned tag);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>percpu_tag_alloc()</tt> will allocate a tag from the given
<tt>pool</tt>.  The only use for the <tt>gfp</tt> argument is to be
checked for the <tt>__GFP_WAIT</tt> flag; if (and only if) that flag is
present, the function will 
wait for an available tag if need be.  The return value is the allocated
tag, or <tt>TAG_FAIL</tt> if no allocation is possible.
<p>
The implementation works by maintaining a set of per-CPU lists of available
tags; whenever possible, <tt>percpu_tag_alloc()</tt> will simply take the
first available entry from the local list, avoiding contention with other
CPUs.  Failing that, it will fall back to a global list of tags, moving a
batch of tags to the appropriate per-CPU list.  Should the global list be
empty, <tt>percpu_tag_alloc()</tt> will attempt to steal some tags from
another CPU or, in the worst case, either wait for an available tag or
return <tt>TAG_FAIL</tt>.  Most of the time, with luck, tag allocation and
freeing operations can be handled entirely locally, with no contention or
cache line bouncing issues.
<p>
The attentive reader might well be thinking that the API proposed here
looks an awful lot like the <a href="/Articles/536293/">IDR subsystem</a>,
which also exists to allocate unique integer identifiers.  That is where
the bulk of the complaints came from; Andrew Morton, in particular, was <a
href="/Articles/554918/">unhappy</a> that no apparent attempt had been made
to adapt IDR before launching into a new implementation:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The worst outcome here is that idr.c remains unimproved and we merge a
	new allocator which does basically the same thing.
<p>
	The best outcome is that idr.c gets improved and we don't have to merge
	duplicative code.
<p>
	So please, let's put aside the shiny new thing for now and work out
	how we can use the existing tag allocator for these applications.
	If we make a genuine effort to do this and decide that it's
	fundamentally hopeless then this is the time to start looking at
	new implementations.
</div>
<p>
The responses from Kent (and from Tejun Heo as well) conveyed their belief
that IDR is, indeed, fundamentally hopeless for this use case.  The IDR
code is designed for the allocation of identifiers, so it works a little
differently: the lowest available number is always returned and the number
range is expanded as needed.  The lowest-number guarantee, in particular,
forces a certain amount of cross-CPU data sharing, putting a limit on how
scalable the IDR code can be.  The IDR API also supports storing (and
quickly looking up) a pointer value associated with each ID, a
functionality not needed by users of tags.  As Tejun <a
href="/Articles/554923/">put it</a>, even if the two allocators were
somehow combined, there would still need to be two distinct ways of using
it, one with allocation ordering guarantees, and one for scalability.
<p>
Andrew proved hard to convince, though; he suggested that, perhaps, tag
allocation could be implemented as some sort of caching layer on top of
IDR.  His position appeared to soften a bit, though, when Tejun <a
href="/Articles/554925/">pointed out</a> that the I/O stack already has
several tag-allocation implementations, "<q>and most, if not all,
suck</q>".  The per-CPU tag allocator could replace those
implementations with common code, reducing the amount of duplication rather
than increasing it.  Improvements of that sort can work wonders when it
comes to getting patches accepted.
<p>
Things then took another twist when Kent posted <a
href="/Articles/555189/">a rewrite of the IDA module</a> as the basis for a
new attempt.  "IDA" is a variant of IDR that lacks the ability to store
pointers associated with IDs; it uses many of the IDR data structures but
does so in a way that is more space-efficient.  Kent's rewrite turns IDA
into a separate layer, with the eventual plan of rewriting IDR to sit on
top.  Before doing that, though, he implemented <a
href="/Articles/555190/">a new per-CPU ID allocator</a> implementing the
API described above on top of the new IDA code.  The end result should be
what Andrew was asking for: 
a single subsystem for the allocation of integer IDs that accommodates all
of the known use cases.
<p>
All this may seem like an excessive amount of discussion around the merging
of a small bit of clearly-useful code that cannot possibly cause bugs
elsewhere in the kernel.  But if there is one thing that the community has
learned over the years, it's that kernel developers are far less scalable
than the kernel itself.  Duplicated code leads to inferior APIs, more bugs,
and more work for developers.  So it's worth putting some effort into
avoiding the merging of duplicated functionality; it is work that will pay
off in the long term — and the kernel community is expecting to be around
and maintaining the code for a long time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

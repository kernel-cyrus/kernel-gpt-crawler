           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>September 26, 2018</br>
           </div>
<p>
When last we <a href="/Articles/761939/">looked</a> at the <a
href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard VPN</a> code and its progress
toward mainline inclusion, said progress was impeded by disagreements about
the new "Zinc"
cryptographic library that is added by the WireGuard patches.  Since that
August look, several more versions of 
WireGuard and Zinc have been posted; it would seem that Zinc is getting
closer to being accepted.  Once that happens, the networking developers are
poised to review that portion of the code, which likely will lead
to WireGuard in the kernel some time in the next development cycle or two.
</p>

<p>
Jason Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180911010838.8818-3-Jason@zx2c4.com/">posted</a>
Zinc v3 as part of an updated WireGuard posting on September&nbsp;10.  Of
the versions he has posted since our article (up to v6 as of this writing),
v3 has gotten most of the comments.  One of the main complaints about Zinc
is that it creates a new crypto API in the kernel without really addressing
why the existing one would not work for WireGuard.  As Ard
Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu9nSeo4PFVrtjtqGQ32eqyxUp3xVCczZfu+dhFz5yLM0A@mail.gmail.com/">put
it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
In spite of the wall of text, you fail to point out exactly why the
existing AEAD [authenticated encryption with associated data] API in unsuitable, and why fixing it is not an option.
<p>
As I pointed out in a previous version, I don't think we need a
separate crypto API/library in the kernel, and I don't think you have
convinced anyone else yet either.
<p>
Perhaps you can devote /your/ rare talent and energy to improving what
we already have for everybody's sake, rather than providing a
completely separate crypto stack that only benefits WireGuard (unless
you yourself port the existing crypto API software algorithms to this
crypto stack first and present *that* work as a convincing case in
itself)
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180911145624.GA21635@kroah.com/">said</a>
that the current crypto API is too hard to use for many parts of the kernel, which leads to
simpler, private implementations of crypto primitives sprinkled all over
the kernel tree.  He suggested that the existing crypto API be switched
over time to use the Zinc primitives where that is possible.  But Eric
Biggers was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180911214737.GA81235@gmail.com/">concerned</a>
that no conversions of that sort have been done, which means there could be
undiscovered problems in the Zinc API that will make it difficult to do so:
"<q>I don't think it makes sense to 
merge all this stuff without doing the conversions, or at the very least
demonstrating how they will be done</q>".
</p>

<p>
Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHmME9rFUruF-VN1pmU-k5nFsb9ppAPhPpW-5Ho9dKL2HCg4kA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that he is willing to do those conversions, but wants to get the series
merged first. "<q>I'd really prefer to land this
series through net-next, and then after we can turn our attention to
integrating this into the existing crypto API</q>".  But, as Andrew Lunn
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180911233015.GD11474@lunn.ch/">pointed
out</a>, that may be putting the cart ahead of the horse.  He noted that
the networking developers have not had a serious look at the WireGuard
patches and won't "<q>until the controversial part
of the code, Zinc, has been sorted out</q>".  He also predicted that
networking maintainer David Miller would not take the code into his tree
without an Acked-by from the crypto maintainers.
</p>

<p>
Miller <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180911.165739.2032677219588723041.davem@davemloft.net/">confirmed</a>
that assessment and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180916.214549.234387075817326903.davem@davemloft.net/">clarified</a>
that even though he is listed as one of the two crypto maintainers, he
would be looking for an ack from the other maintainer, Herbert Xu, as "<q>I haven't done a serious
review of crypto code in ages</q>".  Xu has been quiet, so far, on the
Zinc patches, with one exception.
</p>

<p>
Donenfeld feels that Biesheuvel is not pleased with the
existence of Zinc.  When Biesheuvel <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu8QgRo-Oex2Sk5unET3FMq+1Cp2btAWXCB8xsALxjatHg@mail.gmail.com/">listed</a>
the 
additional 
items that he thinks need to be addressed in Zinc, Donenfeld's <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHmME9qwRzuoo-3Hxahwu=Li2LCz06Uowaq1GFmkts6tsffM7w@mail.gmail.com/">response</a>
is prefaced by a number of worries about Biesheuvel: that he is
"<q>generally hostile to this whole initiative</q>", is trying to
"<q>stall it indefinitely</q>", and perhaps will just keep bikeshedding "<q>until
Zinc copies lots of the same design decisions from the present crypto
API</q>".  Donenfeld did also say that he hoped these were all just fears and
did not truly reflect what was happening.  But that was when Xu stepped in
to make it clear that <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180918042133.4ybztgdooxkoyiru@gondor.apana.org.au/">he
values the review</a> that Biesheuvel has been doing:
<div class="BigQuote">
That may be your view but from what I've read Ard has been very
constructive in pointing out issues in your submission.  If your
response to criticism is to dismiss them as hostile then I'm afraid
that we will not be able to progress on this patch series.
<p>
Please keep in mind that this is a large project that has to support
multiple users on one hand (not just WireGuard) and complex hardware
acceleration drivers on the other.  Ard has been one of the most
prolific contributors to the crypto code and his review should be
taken seriously.
</div>
</p>

<p>
For his part, Biesheuvel tried to <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu9GVbSETjp01tANMwJgA6O9aexhnH+47836KjZg+71q2A@mail.gmail.com/">make
his intentions clear</a> to Donenfeld in another part of the thread:
<div class="BigQuote">
I am not an 'entrenched crypto API guy that is out to get you'. I am a
core ARM developer that takes an interest in crypto, shares your
concern about the usability of the crypto API, and tries to ensure
that what we end up is maintainable and usable for everybody.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But the main technical objections that Biggers and Biesheuvel have raised
were still being hashed out in the thread.  Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/49BAF465-B3DC-4155-BFF9-DB6C386C1878@amacapital.net/">suggested</a>
that Donenfeld add a conversion of one of the algorithms in the existing crypto API to
use Zinc as part of the patch set.  After a bit of resistance, Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHmME9om2rJONj6mMvSPHjiZDQKe05BCe=GonHN=c2Rg4n=pkg@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>.
Conversions of the Poly1305 hash and ChaCha20 cipher (which are what
WireGuard uses) in the existing crypto subsystem were part of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180914162240.7925-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/">WireGuard
v4 patch set</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Along the way, there have also been discussions about the OpenSSL
implementations of some of the primitives (i.e. <a
href="https://github.com/dot-asm/cryptogams">CRYPTOGAMS</a>) that were
incorporated into 
Zinc.  These are written in assembly, but are actually generated from Perl
scripts.  Donenfeld has modified the assembly output in order to make it
comply with kernel coding standards but has also made some other adjustments.
That makes it difficult to keep the implementation in sync with any changes
that OpenSSL might make, Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu-u7vPkU49AzToGHyf_cWp0MiOmpD3cRUt8260QC2wj-Q@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>. "<q>Dumping 10,000s of lines of
generated assembler in the kernel tree like that is really
unacceptable IMO.</q>"  Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180825170629.GA8971@zx2c4.com/">said</a>
that he disagrees with the characterization of the code, but that getting
his changes into the OpenSSL upstream is desirable.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, there were some minor licensing concerns (and the resulting <a
href="/Articles/739183/">SPDX identifiers</a>) with some files, which have
seemingly been resolved.  Similarly, some performance problems were noted
and addressed.  In short, Zinc is starting to look like something that could
be merged.  Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180925145622.29959-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/">posted</a> 
v6 of the WireGuard patch set on September&nbsp;25.
</p>

<p>
Zinc is still awaiting an ack from Xu, though it is not clear how much he
has scrutinized the code at this point.  Once that happens, though, the
networking side of the patch set can be reviewed by Miller and other
networking developers.  If all goes well, it will end up in the mainline
before too long—but that still means at least four, or more likely seven, months
from now.  Whenever it comes, it is clear that WireGuard is eagerly anticipated by many.

For what it's worth, I wound up doing those conversions anyway, and they're a part of v6. This pattern applies for most other things -- I didn't want to do them, in order to keep the Zinc patchset small, but Ard has insisted, and I've relented. So hopefully piece by piece things are being done as needed. So it goes.

<blockquote> but that getting his changes into the OpenSSL upstream is desirable.</blockquote>

And indeed Andy Polyakov and I have already started talking about this stuff and things are moving nicely on this front.

Or he could just as well be following the communication standard which has been set by the kernel community leader through his response and thus acts as an example for others to follow and thinks this is how the community prefers to communicate, could he not? ( if you give him the benefit of doubt )<br>
<p>
It can also be a good practise in communities for other reviewers to chime in once certain number of reviews from the same reviewer is exceeded ( like 3 or something ), to prevent the submitter getting the feeling that no matter how many times he rewrites things at the reviewer behest, it never is or will be good enough. <br>
<p>
Then there are legit case to what he is implying is taking place ( the I own the code syndrom which is similar when administrators self claim ownership of servers ) but as you point out there are better ways to deal with this instead of starting ad hominen attack, like for example just saying it's starting to feel like i'm swimming upstream, can I get a second opinion from someone else ( or something along those lines ). <br>

I agree, I should have written this differently and toned this down a bit. I apologized in a follow-up email.<br>
<p>
The patchset is very much benefitting from the reviews of many, who have all sorts of interesting perspectives to offer. In many areas it's improved tremendously thanks to those. However, I'm pretty wary of directions that lead to bloating the core concepts of Zinc and making the same mistakes as the current crypto API. On those matters, I've been particularly standoffish, especially when I've seen many repeated instances of this. But indeed that should be handled more diplomatically.<br>

I frankly agree with the anger. Ard is repeatably asking for an explanation of what is wrong with the old API, when that explanation has been provided over and over. What is going on here is a fear of admitting fault, and we have a worse kernel because of it.<br>

"If, now, your right eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna.  Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in Gehenna."--Jesus, Matthew 5:29-30<br>

After about a week of digging through a sizable amount of essentially legacy Java code mostly created via mindless copy'n'paste and based on meanwhile seriously ancient version of JBoss, Seam, JSF and RichFaces in order to identifty a certain problem with it, find a way to fix it which works with "the stack" and carefully trying to get rid of at least some ancient horrors encountered during the journey, this "My API!" "His API!" squabbling make for some delightful, light social comedy :-)<br>

The generated assembly thing sounds like a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the GPL.<br>

Would it make sense and be possible to commit the generation code rather than the generated result ?<br>

Often it's best to commit both.  Then you have a safety check in case the generator starts doing something weird.<br>

Including just the generated assembly, and not the generator, would violate GPL2 (both the spirit and the letter), which require source code and says "The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "  That's the same reason that obfuscated C code does not count as "source code". In this case, to fix bugs or add features a developer would not edit the assembly code, s/he would edit the generator or the input to the generator, so that has to be included.  Fortunately it appears that this is being done.<br>

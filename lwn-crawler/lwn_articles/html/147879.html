<h1>A CLOCK-Pro page replacement implementation</h1>

Virtual memory management appears to be a perennially unsolved operating
systems problem.  Nobody has yet figured out how to perform page
replacement in such a way as to ensure that the pages that will be needed
in the future may be found in main memory.  Crystal balls, it seems, remain
fiendishly difficult to implement.
<p>

The reigning algorithm used in most systems is a variant of the
least-recently-used (LRU) scheme.  If a page has not been used in a long
time, the reasoning goes, it probably will not be needed again in the near
future; pages which have not been used for a while are thus candidates for
eviction from main memory.  In practice, tracking the usage of every page
would impose an unacceptable amount of overhead, and is not done.  Instead,
the VM subsystem scans sequentially through the "active list" of pages in
use, marking them as "inactive."  Pages on the inactive
list are candidates for eviction.  Some of those pages will certainly be
needed soon, however, with the result that they will be referenced
before that eviction takes place.  When this happens, the affected pages
are put back on the active list at the "recently used" end.  As long as
pages stay in the inactive list for a reasonable time before eviction, this
algorithm approximates a true LRU scheme.

<p>

This mechanism tends to fall apart with certain types of workloads,
however.  Actions like initializing a huge array, reading a large file (for
streaming media playback, for example), starting OpenOffice, or walking
through a large part of the filesystem can fill main memory with pages
which are unlikely to be used again anytime soon - at the expense of the
pages the system actually needs.  Pages from files start in the inactive
list and may, at least, be shoved back out relatively quickly, but
anonymous memory pages go straight to the active list.
Many Linux users are familiar with the
occasional sluggish response which can come after the active list has been
flushed in this way; with some workloads, this behavior can be a constant
thing, and the system will consistently perform poorly.

<p>
Rik van Riel has recently posted a set of patches aimed at improving the
performance of the VM subsystem under contemporary loads.  The algorithm
implemented is based on <a
href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/hpcs/WWW/HTML/publications/abs05-3.html">CLOCK-Pro</a>,
developed by Song Jiang, Feng Chen, and Xiaodong Zhang.  CLOCK-Pro attempts
to move beyond the LRU approach by tracking how often pages are accessed
and tweaking the behavior of the VM code to match.  At its core, CLOCK-Pro
tries to ensure that pages in the inactive list are referenced less
frequently than those on the active list.  It thus differs from LRU

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/clock-pro-accesses.png" width="432"
height="152" alt="[access diagram]" align="right">

schemes, which prioritize the most recently accessed pages even if those
particular pages are almost never used by the application.  Consider, as an
example, the diagram to the right showing access patterns for two pages.
At the time <tt>t1</tt> marked by the red line, an LRU algorithm would
prefer page&nbsp;2 over page&nbsp;1, even though the latter is more likely
to be used again in the near future.
<p>

Implementing CLOCK-Pro requires that the kernel keep track of pages which
have recently been evicted from main memory.  To this end, Rik's patches
create a new data structure which tries to perform this tracking without
adding much extra overhead.  There is a new kernel function:
<p>
<pre>
    int do_remember_page(struct address_space *mapping, unsigned long index);
</pre>
<p>
The VM code will, when moving a page out of main memory, first call
<tt>remember_page()</tt> with the relevant information.  This function
implements a data structure which looks a little like the following:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/nonresident_page.png" width=424 height=273
 alt="[Cheezy nonresident page diagram]">
</center>
<p>
When a page is to be remembered, a hash value is generated from the
<tt>mapping</tt> and <tt>index</tt> parameters; this value will be used as
an index into the <tt>nonres_table</tt> array.  Each hash bucket contains a
fixed number of entries for nonresident pages.  <tt>do_remember_page()</tt>
treats the hash bucket like a circular buffer; it will use the
<tt>hand</tt> index to store a cookie representing the page (a separate
hash, essentially) in the next available slot, possibly overwriting
information which was there before.  The size of the entire data structure
is chosen so that it can remember approximately as many evicted pages as
there are pages of real memory in the system.  The cost of the structure is
one 32-bit word for each remembered page.
<p>
At some point in the future, the kernel will find itself faulting a page
into memory.  It can then see if it has seen that page before with a call
to:
<p>
<pre>
    int recently_evicted(struct address_space *mapping, unsigned long index);
</pre>
<p>
A non-negative return value indicates that the given page was found in the
nonresident page cache, and had, indeed, been evicted not all that long
ago.  The return value is actually an estimate of the page's "distance" - a
value which is taken by seeing how far the page's entry is from the current
value of the <tt>hand</tt> index (in a circular buffer sense) and scaling
it by the size of the array.  In a rough sense, the distance is the number
of pages which have been evicted since the page of interest was pushed out.
<p>

Whenever a page is faulted in, the kernel computes a distance for the
oldest page in the active list; this distance is an estimate taken from how
long ago the oldest page would have been scanned (at the current rate).
This distance is compared to the distance of the newly-faulted page (which
is scaled relative to the total number of recently evicted pages) to get a
sense for whether this page (which had been evicted) has been accessed more
frequently than the oldest in-memory page.  If so, the kernel concludes that
the wrong pages are in memory; in response, it will decrease the maximum
desired size of the active list to make room for the more-frequently
accessed pages which are languishing in secondary storage.  The kernel will
also, in this case, add the just-faulted page directly to the active list,
on the theory that it will be useful for a while.
<p>

If, instead, pages being faulted in are more "distant" than in-core pages,
the VM subsystem concludes that it is doing the right thing.  In this
situation, the size of the active list will be slowly increased (up to a
maximum limit).  More
distant pages are faulted in to the inactive list, meaning that they are
more likely to be evicted again in the near future.
<p>

Your editor applied the patch to a vanilla 2.6.12 kernel and ran some
highly scientific tests: a highly parallel kernel make while simultaneously
running a large "<tt>grep&nbsp;-r</tt> to read large amounts of file data
into the page cache.  The patched kernel adds a file
(<tt>/proc/refaults</tt>) which summarizes the results from the nonresident
page cache; after this experiment it looked like this:
<p>
<pre>
     Refault distance          Hits
        0 -      4096           138
     4096 -      8192           108
     8192 -     12288            93
    12288 -     16384            88
    16384 -     20480            86
    20480 -     24576            84
    24576 -     28672            59
    28672 -     32768            48
    32768 -     36864            53
    36864 -     40960            46
    40960 -     45056            43
    45056 -     49152            46
    49152 -     53248            39
    53248 -     57344            39
    57344 -     61440            39
 New/Beyond     61440         11227
</pre>
<p>

This histogram shows that the vast majority of pages brought into the
system had never been seen before; they would be mainly the result of the
large <tt>grep</tt>.  A much smaller number of pages - a few hundred - had
very small distances.  If the patch is working right, those pages (being,
one hopes, important things like the C compiler) would be fast-tracked into
the active list while the large number of unknown pages would be hustled
back out of main memory relatively quickly.
<p>

As it turns out, <a href="/Articles/147898/">the patch doesn't work
right</a> quite yet.  Much of the structure is in place, but the desired
results are not yet being seen.  These details will presumably be worked
out before too long.  Only at that point will it be possible to benchmark
the new paging code and decide whether it truly performs better or not.
One never knows ahead of time with virtual memory code; the proof, as they
say, is in the paging.

      I've proposed something like this probably 5 years ago. Well, I've only <br>
started a discussion, and didn't write code, and the discussion was turned <br>
down, because the Linux kernel maintainer back then thought the VM was <br>
"good enough" (I don't think so). <br>
 <br>
The main point in the scheme I proposed is a multi-level list of pages, <br>
not just a two-level as it is now. Pages which have been accessed recently <br>
elevate by one level, pages which didn't go down one level. That way, <br>
frequently used pages end up on the top, while unused pages quickly turn <br>
down to the bottom, making them subject for eviction. Page scanning should <br>
depend on page age, i.e. recently allocated pages should be scanned more <br>
often than old pages. <br>
 <br>
New pages, however, don't start at the top, but (maybe depending on how <br>
they were allocated) somewhere in between. <br>
 <br>
My other pet peeve is the page size. My rule of thumb for random data <br>
access is that access time and transfer time should be about the same. <br>
I.e. 4k pages, which take 10ms to access and 0.1ms to transfer, are ways <br>
too small. The swap in bandwidth is about 400k/s. You can write a small <br>
memory hog which evicts most of the other programs in a second (writing <br>
out sequential pages is easy), and then wait for a minute to have them <br>
demand-page in again (no easy read-in of sequential pages). <br>
 <br>
At the time where the page size decission was made (~1985), the 4k size <br>
did make sense, taking my rule of thumb into account (same 10ms access <br>
time, but clearly less than 1MB/s transfer). Fortunately, it's only a few <br>
years when the next larger native page size on x86 (2MB) will fit in well <br>
with the rule of thumb, and then should be used. <br>

      It's good to see Rik back on the memory management task again.  His work in the 2.3 kernels was certainly responsible for many of the stability issues of early 2.4 releases. Finally the bullet was bitten and his code removed.<br>
<p>
I hope we don't see a repeat of this in the 2.6 kernels.<br>

      Kernels get unstable when the maintainer only merges experimental code and drops bugfixes on the floor.  Luckily these days the kernel has a decent process for making sure that doesn't happen, with patches filtering through Andrew Morton's -mm tree first, and Linus having tools to be able to merge the patches he needs to merge.<br>
<p>
During the early 2.4 days, all of the bugfixes needed to get the VM stable were in the -ac kernels, but due to a lack of tools and process they never made it into Linus' tree...<br>

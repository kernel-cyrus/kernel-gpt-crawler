<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The 2013 Kernel Summit closed out with a set of lightning talks covering a
wide range of topics including random numbers, configuration options, and
ARM board testing.
<p>
Ted Ts'o started things off with a discussion of the kernel's random number
generators.  There has been, he noted dryly, a significant increase in
interest in the quality of the kernel's random numbers recently.  His
biggest concern in this area remains embedded devices that create
cryptographic keys shortly after they boot; there may be little or no
useful entropy in the system at that point.  Some fixes have been added
recently, including adding more entropy sources and mixing in
system-specific information like MAC addresses, but that still may not be
enough entropy to do a whole lot of good.  That can be especially true on
systems where the in-kernel <tt>get_cycles()</tt> function returns no
useful information, a problem which was <a href="/Articles/567055/">covered
here</a> in September.
<p>
MIPS was one of the architectures that had just that problem.  Since MIPS
chips are used in devices like home routers, this is a real concern.  In
that case, the developers were able to find a fine-grained counter that,
while useless for timekeeping, can be used to add a bit of entropy to the
random pool.  A new interface has been added to allow architecture code to
provide access to such counters.  But the best solution, he said, was for
vendors to put hardware random number generators on their chips.
<p>
Josh Triplett presented a proposal to get rid of the various "defconfig"
files found in the kernel tree.  These files are supposed to contain a
complete, bootable configuration for a given architecture.  He would like
to move that information into the Kconfig that define the configuration
options themselves.  There would be a new syntax saying whether a given
option should be enabled by default whenever the default system config was
requested by the user.
<p>
Linus didn't like the idea, though, saying that it would clutter the
Kconfig files and still not solve the problem.  He also noted that most
defconfig files are nearly useless; the x86 one, he said, is essentially a
random configuration used by Andi Kleen several years ago.  A lot of the
relevant configuration settings are architecture-dependent, so it would be
necessary to add architecture-specific selectors and such.  
<p>
The plan at this point is to move further discussion to the mailing list,
but, without some changes, this idea probably will not get too far.
<p>
Peter Senna talked briefly about the Coccinelle semantic analysis tool
which, he said, is finding a few bugs in each kernel development cycle.  He
would like to add more test cases to the system; interested developers are
directed toward <a href="http://coccinellery.org/">coccinellery.org</a> for
examples of how to use this tool.  (One could also see <a
href="/Articles/315686/">this LWN article</a> for an introduction to
Coccinelle).  Dan Carpenter talked briefly about his smatch tool, which is
also improving over time.  His biggest goal at this point is to provide
more user-friendly output; the warnings that come out of smatch now can be
rather difficult to interpret.
<p>
The final talk was presented by Paul Walmsley; it covered automatic testing
of ARM kernels.  He is running a testing lab that builds and boots a number
of trees, generating reports when things go wrong.  Olof Johansson run an
elaborate testing setup; among other things, it performs fuzz testing with
Trinity.  There is also a 20-board testing array run by Kevin Hilman; he is
doing power consumption tests as well.
<p>
These testing rigs, Paul said, are catching a lot of bugs, often before the
relevant patches get very far.  There are also a lot of work to keep going,
though.  Part of that problem may be related to the fact that the bisection
of problems must be done manually; work is being done to automate that
process as soon as possible.
<p>
After that there was a brief discussion of the Kernel Summit itself; some
developers complained about communications, saying that they didn't always
know about everything that was going on.  There was also some discussion of
the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board election held the night
before, which was a somewhat noisy and chaotic affair.  Thereafter, the
group picture was taken and the developers headed out in search of dinner
and beer.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 18, 2019</br>
           </div>
The arm64 architecture is found at the core of many, if not most, mobile
devices; that means that arm64 devices are destined to be the target of
attackers worldwide.  That has led to a high level of interest in
technologies that can harden these systems.  There are currently several
such technologies, based in both hardware and software, that are being
readied for the arm64 kernel; read on for a survey on what is
coming. 
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h4>E0PD</h4>
<p>
The Meltdown vulnerability enables an attacker in user space to read
kernel-space data
by making use of a combination of speculative execution and cache-based
side channels. 
The kernel's defense against Meltdown is <a href="/Articles/741878/">kernel
page-table isolation</a> — removing the kernel's page tables from the
user-space mapping entirely.  That works, but it has a significant
performance cost and it can interfere with the use of other processor features.
Nonetheless, it is fairly widely accepted that address-space isolation will
be <a href="/Articles/803823/">increasingly necessary</a> to protect
systems for some time.
<p>
There is an alternative, though: fix the hardware instead.  One initiative
in this area appears to be the E0PD feature, which was added as part of
the Arm v8.5 extensions.  Documentation on E0PD is scarce to the point of
nonexistence; not even <a
href="/ml/linux-arm-kernel/20191111185243.42638-1-broonie@kernel.org/">the
patch set supporting it</a> from Mark Brown describes how it works or what
the acronym stands for.  That said, the most informative bit of text about E0PD
can be found there:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	E0PD, introduced in the ARMv8.5 extensions, [...]
	ensures that accesses from userspace to the kernel's
	half of the memory map to always fault with constant time,
	preventing timing attacks without requiring constant unmapping and
	remapping or preventing legitimate accesses.
</div>
<p>
E0PD, thus, doesn't prevent speculative execution from going off into
memory that user space should not be able to access, but it does block the
side channel normally used to extract the data exposed by incorrectly
speculated operations.  Systems that support E0PD do not need to enable
kernel page-table isolation and should, thus, regain the performance that
it took away; no benchmark results were included with the patch set,
though.  E0PD support for the kernel is apparently close to ready, but
the availability of processors with E0PD support may take rather longer.
<p>
<h4>Return-address signing</h4>
<p>
Arm <a href="/Articles/718888/">pointer authentication</a> is a mechanism
for applying cryptographic signatures to pointers used in running code.
A special instruction creates a signature for a given pointer value
using a secret key; the signature is stored in the unused bits at the
upper end of the pointer itself.  A separate instruction verifies that a
given pointer was indeed signed using a specific key.  This mechanism can
be used to prevent attackers from fooling the kernel into using an
ill-advised pointer value.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-arm-kernel/1571300065-10236-1-git-send-email-amit.kachhap@arm.com/">return-address
signing patch set</a> from Amit Daniel Kachhap uses this feature for a
specific purpose: protecting the return addresses for function calls
on the stack.  In particular, it uses the
<tt>&#8209;msign&#8209;return&#8209;address</tt> flag added to GCC&nbsp;7
to build the kernel with this protection. 
On entry to a function, the return address is
signed; when the time comes for the function to return, the signature is
verified.  Should the verification fail, a kernel oops will be generated
and the running process will be killed.
<p>
The intent behind this work, of course, is to protect the kernel against
buffer overflows or other attacks that overwrite the stack.  An attacker
may be able to corrupt the stack, but they should not be able to place
return addresses there that will pass the verification step.  That should
protect the kernel against a wide range of potential attacks, since many
common techniques depend on placing crafted return addresses on the stack.
<p>
<h4>Shadow call stacks</h4>
<p>
Another approach to protecting return addresses can be seen in the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191105235608.107702-1-samitolvanen@google.com/">shadow
call stack support patch set</a> from Sami Tolvanen.  Rather than signing
return addresses, this patch set uses <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html">the Clang
<tt>&#8209;fsanitize=shadow&#8209;call&#8209;stack</tt> option</a> to
cause return addresses to be placed on a separate "shadow" stack located
somewhere in memory.  Before a function returns, it restores the return
address from the shadow stack.
<p>
The current call stack tends to be some of the easiest memory for an
attacker to corrupt; any buffer overflow of an automatic variable will do.
With the shadow call stack, though, this sort of corruption is rendered
less harmful, since return addresses no longer live on the stack.  The
shadow stack will typically be much harder for an attacker to modify, or to
even know where it might be located.  The result should, once again, be a
system that is more secure against buffer-overflow attacks.
<p>
Return-address signing and shadow call stacks appear to be two different
approaches to the same problem; one probably does not want to use both of
them.  Tolvanen addresses the question of which should be used in the cover
letter:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	[The shadow call stack] has a minimal performance overhead, but
	allocating shadow 
	stacks increases kernel memory usage. The feature is therefore
	mostly useful on hardware that lacks support for PAC instructions.
</div>
<p>
In other words, processors that can do pointer authentication should use
that feature; shadow call stacks are there for those without that support.
This patch set seems to be about ready; it is currently <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191113120337.GA26599@willie-the-truck/">earmarked</a>
for the 5.6 merge window.
<p>
<a name="bti"></a>
<h4>Branch target identification</h4>
<p>
The last of the arm64 features under consideration is branch-target
identification (BTI), which is intended to trap wild jumps.  The idea is
simple enough: if BTI is enabled, the first instruction encountered after
an indirect jump must be a special BTI instruction.  That instruction is a
no-op on systems without BTI; with BTI, it has the added benefit of not
throwing a fault should it be jumped to.  Jumps to locations that do not
feature a BTI instruction, instead, will lead to the quick death of the
process involved.
<p>
BTI, thus, is a way of marking code that is meant to be the target of an
indirect jump, thwarting attacks that somehow convince the kernel to jump
to some random spot.  That should block a range of attacks based on, for
example, overwriting a structure full of function pointers called by the
kernel.  It is interesting to note that BTI does <i>not</i> check the
target of a return from a function; the intent is that return-address
signing should be used to protect returns.  The GCC&nbsp;9 release includes
support for BTI.
<p>
Each of these technologies addresses one piece of the problem of protecting
arm64 systems from attackers.  Put together, they should have the effect of
making these systems into significantly harder targets.  The arms race will
not end, and attackers will certainly find ways of getting around these
techniques, at least some of the time.  But, with luck, they will find
themselves being frustrated more often in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Exploiting memory safety bugs is a huge business. Other kinds of security bugs may or may not be more numerous, but that has no impact on the cost/benefit analysis of these mitigations.<br>
<p>
It is true that stack buffer overflows are quite uncommon these days, so you could argue that shadow stacks aren't worth the complexity.<br>

A lot of energy is going into password managers (e.g. Firefox Lockwise), security keys (Yubikey etc), FIDO/WebAuthn, etc etc, and efforts to promote the deployment of that tech, to bypass the password problem. None of that is worth much if the users' software is easily hijacked by malicious input.<br>
<p>
We have to solve the UX issues *and* we have to solve the fragile software issues. The resources to address the latter (e.g. kernel developers) aren't easily repurposed to tackle the former, and even if they were, where's your *proof* that that would be the right thing to do? Postulating a conspiracy theory isn't proof.<br>

To be clear: hardening Linux, Android and client software in general against exploitation definitely helps block attacks against the cheap phones of "average people" all around the world, and it also helps block attacks against the services those people depend on (whether they know it or not).<br>
<p>
And FWIW, the "cloud provider megacorps" have a keen interest in improving security UI/UX just as much as preventing software exploitation. AWS lets me use my phishing-proof Yubikey for authentication, but my bank doesn't yet :-(.<br>

      <blockquote>hardening helps cloud-provider megacorps while the latter would help average people avoid get their passwords guessed/phished all around the world.</blockquote>

<p>This is a nonsensical distinction.  One of the things those "cloud-provider megacorps" are doing is handling data that affects millions of "average people".  That makes them an incredibly tempting target for hackers, because it means they can steal information wholesale instead of retail.  I very much want those big companies to put serious effort into protecting their data.

      The latest <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/ea/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile">ARMv8-A manual</a> describes E0PD in the section titled "Preventing EL0 access to halves of the address map", which summarises the feature:

<blockquote>
If ARMv8.5-E0PD is implemented and enabled, the TCR_ELx.{E0PD0, E0PD1} fields can prevent unprivileged access to the addresses translated by TTBR0_ELx or TTBR1_ELx. If access is prevented, the fault is reported as a level 0 fault, and should take the same time to generate, whether the address is present in the TLB or not, to mitigate attacks that use fault timing.
</blockquote>

Setting TCR_ELx.E0PD0 should prevent userspace (EL0) accesses to the kernel half of the address space (which is mapped via TTBR1_ELx), speculative or otherwise. The constant-time faulting behaviour should prevent page table depth probing attacks that can be used against KASLR.

The documentation and the commit message should probably make that first bit more explicit -- i.e. that /speculative/ accesses are indeed prevented.<br>
<p>
Reading the commit message as it stands doesn't give any indication as to why E0PD would prevent Meltdown, as it only mentions constant-time faulting.<br>

“All possible pointer addresses and store them on disk”<br>
No, since that’s some pretty large fraction of 2^64.<br>

Since the 64 bits of a pointer is being partitioned into some upper bits for the signature, and the remaining lower bits for the virtual address, if you know the virtual address you're interested in you only have to try 2^(signature_width) possibilities. So if the split is e.g. 16 bits for the signature and 48 bits for the virtual address (a common virtual address size on 64-bit processors), that will only require on average 32768 attempts to brute-force the right signature for a given address.<br>
<p>
Despite 2^64 being a rather big number (over 18 million TiB), I am still reminded of all the times that people have in the past abused the high bits of addresses thinking that they will never be needed for actual addresses. Two notable examples are IBM mainframes and the Motorola MC68000, both of which originally only used the low 24 bits of addresses, so the high parts were often used for other stuff, which caused huge problems when they expanded the address size (to 31 bits for System/370-XA and MC68012, 32 bits for MC68020).<br>

Ah, I misunderstood - I (incorrectly) read this as pointer encryption, but this is just signing with something stuck in the upper bits.   (Clearly described in the article, in some lines I clearly skipped.)<br>

You're missing a much more up-to-date example, ARM64 itself, which has had pointer tagging built in from the beginning.
<blockquote>
The kernel configures the translation tables so that translations made
via TTBR0 (i.e. userspace mappings) have the top byte (bits 63:56) of
the virtual address ignored by the translation hardware. This frees up
this byte for application use.
</blockquote>

<p>
(Also, early ARM used the top six bits of the program counter for status flags and the bottom two bits for mode flags, making it faster to save state when handling interrupts.)

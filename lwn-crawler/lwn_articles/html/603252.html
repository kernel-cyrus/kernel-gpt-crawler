Performance regressions are a constant problem for kernel developers.  A
seemingly innocent change might cause a significant performance degradation,
but only for
users and workloads that the original developer has no access to.
Sometimes these regressions can lurk for years until the affected users
update their kernels and notice that things are running more slowly.  The
good news is that the development community is responding with more testing
aimed at detecting performance regressions.  This testing found a classic
example of this kind of bug in 3.16; the bug merits a look as an example of
how hard it can be to keep things working optimally for a wide range of
users.
<p>
<h4>The birth of a regression</h4>
<p>
The kernel's read-copy-update (RCU) mechanism enables a great deal of
kernel scalability by facilitating lock-free changes to data structures
and batching of cleanup operations.  A fundamental aspect of RCU's
operation is the detection of "quiescent states" on each processor; a
quiescent state is one in which no kernel code can hold a reference to any
RCU-protected data structure.  Initially, quiescent states were defined as
times when the processor was running in user space, but things have gotten
rather more complex since 
then.  (See LWN's <a href="/Kernel/Index/#Read-copy-update">lengthy list of
RCU articles</a> for lots of details on how this all works).
<p>
The kernel's <a href="/Articles/549580/">full tickless mode</a>, which is
only now becoming ready for serious use, can make the detection of
quiescent states more difficult.  A CPU running in the tickless mode will,
due to the constraints of that mode, be running a single process.  If that
process stays within the kernel for a long time, no quiescent states will
be observed.  That, in turn, prevents RCU from declaring the end of a "grace
period" and running the (possibly lengthy) set of accumulated RCU
callbacks.  Delayed grace periods can result in excessive latencies
elsewhere in the kernel 
or, if things go really badly, out-of-memory problems.
<p>
One might argue (as some developers did) that code that loops in the kernel
in this way already has serious problems.  But such situations do come
about.  Eric Dumazet <a href="/Articles/603259/">mentioned</a> one: a
process calling <tt>exit()</tt> when it has thousands of sockets open.
Each of those open sockets will result in structures being freed via RCU;
that can lead to a long list of work to be done while that same process is
still closing sockets and, thus, preventing RCU processing by looping in
the kernel. 
<p>
RCU developer Paul McKenney put together <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/ac1bea85781e9004da9b3e8a4b097c18492d857c">a
solution</a> to this problem based on a simple insight: the kernel already
has a mechanism for allowing other things to happen while some sort of
lengthy operation is in progress.  Code that is known to be prone to long
loops will, on occasion, call <tt>cond_resched()</tt> to give the scheduler
a chance to run a higher-priority process.  In the tickless situation,
there will be no higher-priority process, though, so, in current kernels,
<tt>cond_resched()</tt> does nothing of any use in the tickless mode.
<p>
But kernel code can only call <tt>cond_resched()</tt> in places where it
can handle being scheduled out of the CPU.  So it cannot be running in an
atomic context and, thus, cannot hold references to any RCU-protected data
structures.  In other words, a call to <tt>cond_resched()</tt> marks a
quiescent state; all that is needed is to tell RCU about it.
<p>
As it happens, <tt>cond_resched()</tt> is called in a lot of
performance-sensitive places, so it is not possible to add a lot of
overhead there.  So Paul did not call into RCU to signal a quiescent state
with every <tt>cond_resched()</tt> call; instead, that function was modified to
increment a per-CPU counter and, using that counter, only call into RCU
once for every 256 (by default) <tt>cond_resched()</tt> calls.  That
appeared to fix the problem with minimal overhead, so the patch was merged
during the 3.16 merge window.
<p>
Soon thereafter, Dave Hansen <a href="/Articles/603262/">reported</a>
that one of his benchmarks (a program which opens and closes a lot of files
while doing little else) had slowed down, and that, with bisection, he
had identified the <tt>cond_resched()</tt> change as the culprit.
Interestingly, the problem is not with <tt>cond_resched()</tt> itself,
which remained fast as intended.  Instead, the change caused RCU grace
periods to happen more often than before; that caused RCU callbacks to be
processed in smaller batches and led to increased contention in the slab
memory allocator.  By changing the threshold for quiescent states from
every 256 <tt>cond_resched()</tt> calls to a much larger  number, Dave was
able to get back to a 3.15 level of performance.
<p>
<h4>Fixing the problem</h4>
<p>
One might argue that the proper fix is simply to raise that threshold for
all users.  But doing so doesn't just restore performance; it also restores
the problem that the <tt>cond_resched()</tt> change was intended to fix.
The challenge, then, is finding a way to fix one workload's problem without
penalizing other workloads.
<p>
There is an additional challenge in that some developers would like to make
<tt>cond_resched()</tt> into a complete no-op on fully preemptable
kernels.  After all, if the kernel is preemptable, there should be no need
to poll for conditions that would require calling into the scheduler;
preemption will simply take care of that when the need arises.  So fixes
that depend on <tt>cond_resched()</tt> continuing to do something may fail
on preemptable kernels in the future.
<p>
Paul's <a href="/Articles/603263/">first fix</a> took the form of a series
of patches making changes in a few places.  There was still a check in
<tt>cond_resched()</tt>, but that check took a different form.  The RCU
core was modified to take note when a specific processor holds up the
conclusion of a grace period for an excessive period of time; when that
condition was detected, a per-CPU flag would be set.  Then,
<tt>cond_resched()</tt> need only check that flag and, if it is set, note
the passing of a quiescent period.  That change reduced the frequency of
grace periods, restoring much of the lost performance.
<p>
In addition, Paul introduced a new function called
<tt>cond_resched_rcu_qs()</tt>, otherwise known as "the slow version of
<tt>cond_resched()</tt>".  By default, it does the same thing as ordinary
<tt>cond_resched()</tt>, but the intent is that it would continue to
perform the RCU grace period check even if <tt>cond_resched()</tt> is
changed to skip that check — or to do nothing at all.  The patch changed
<tt>cond_resched()</tt> calls to <tt>cond_resched_rcu_qs()</tt> in a
handful of strategic places where problems have been observed in the past.
<p>
This solution worked, but it left some developers unhappy.  For those who
are trying to get the most performance out of their CPUs, any overhead in a
function like <tt>cond_resched()</tt> is too much.  So Paul came up with <a
href="/Articles/603266/">a different approach</a> that requires no checks
in <tt>cond_resched()</tt> at all.  Instead, when the RCU core notices that
a CPU has held up the grace period for too long, it sends an
inter-processor interrupt (IPI) to that processor.  That IPI will be
delivered when the target processor is not running in atomic context; it
is, thus, another good time to note a quiescent state.
<p>
This solution might be surprising at first glance: IPIs are expensive and,
thus, are not normally seen as the way to improve scalability.  But this
approach has two advantages: it removes the monitoring overhead from the
performance-sensitive CPUs, and the IPIs only happen when a problem has
been detected.  So, most of the time, it should have no impact on CPUs
running in the tickless mode at all.  It would thus appear that this
solution is preferable, and that this particular performance regression has
been solved.
<p>
<h4>How good is good enough?</h4>
<p>
At least, it would appear that way if it weren't for the fact that Dave <a
href="/Articles/603269/">still observes a slowdown</a>, though it is much
smaller than it was before.  The solution is, thus, not perfect, but Paul
is <a href="/Articles/603270/">inclined to declare victory</a> on this one
anyway: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So, given that short grace periods help other workloads (I have the
	scars to prove it), and given that the patch fixes some real
	problems, and given that the large number for
	rcutree.jiffies_till_sched_qs got us within 3%, shouldn't we
	consider this issue closed?
</div>
<p>

Dave still <a href="/Articles/603344/">isn't entirely happy</a> with the
situation; he noted that the regression is closer to 10% with the default
settings, and said "<q>This change of existing behavior removes some of
the benefits that my system gets out of RCU</q>".  Paul <a
href="/Articles/603345/">responded</a> that he is "<q>not at all
interested in that micro-benchmark becoming the kernel's
straightjacket</q>" and sent in <a href="/Articles/603346/">a pull
request</a> including the second version of the fix.  If there are any
real-world workloads that are adversely affected by this change, he
suggested, there are a number of ways to tune the system to mitigate the
problem. 
<p>
Regardless of whether this issue is truly closed or not,
this regression demonstrates some of the hazards of kernel development on
contemporary systems.  Scalability pressures lead to complex code trying to
ensure that everything happens at the right time with minimal overhead.
But it will never be possible for a developer to test with all possible
workloads, so there will often be one that shows a surprising performance
regression in response to a change.  Fixing one workload may well penalize
another; making changes that do not hurt any workloads may be close to
impossible.  But, given enough testing and attention to the problems
revealed by the tests, most problems can hopefully be found and corrected
before they affect production users.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Any real-world workload is a mix of the things we measure in a microbenchmark like this.  The microbenchmark just breaks the workload down in to constituent pieces so that the pieces can be measured more easily.<br>
<p>
Almost any Linux system does lots of opens and closes.  On my system, one instance of 'top' can do thousands of them a second.  Everyone should care about how fast these kinds of very common operations are, even if they can't measure the overhead when they get slower by a small amount.<br>

And one reason for doing this is that there might be a series of small changes, each of which provides (say) either a 0.5% improvement or a 0.5% degradation.  Measuring these changes one at a time against a more realistic heavyweight application-based benchmark might show no measurable change for each, and taken together, their overall effect might be to cancel each other, thus providing no measurable change in performance.<br>
<p>
In contrast, if you have a small tight benchmark, you might be able to sort the changes that improve performance from those that degrade performance.  Of course, you should follow up by measuring the collection of changes that improved performance on a more realistic benchmark.  After all, sometimes small changes interact in surprising ways.<br>

While everything you say is correct, it's also important to keep in mind that microbenchmarks tend to stress the system in ways that are different than normal use.<br>

In this case, it's not that the individual opens and closes get slower, it's that when there are too many of them happening at once they end up getting slower.<br>
<p>
so while a microbenchmark may show a 3% penalty, it's very possible that a real-world task that did 1/10 as many opens/closes (because it's doing real work in between) would not see a 0.3% penalty, but no measurable penalty<br>

Agreed.  And the points you make are exactly why I said that you should follow up microbenchmark tests with tests on a more realistic benchmark.<br>

Yeah, I'm fairly happy with it at this point.  On my system, things got better when scaling from 1-&gt;80 CPUs, and then marginally worse (and maybe noisier) from 81-&gt;160.  But, that 81-&gt;160 range is where we fall over to using the hyperthreads and where tasks are not bound 1:1 with CPUs, so the scheduler comes in to play more.  So, it's naturally noisier in that range.  Also, the hyperthreads almost never scale as well as physical CPU cores, so scrutinizing scalability in this range isn't as interesting.<br>

Are there any alternatives to RCU? The implementation seems to be complex, and the heuristics to run RCU callbacks every X cond_resched() calls seems quite arbitrary. Also the fact that its run time is amortized makes it hard to analyze it seems to me.<br>
<p>
Is there no way to get the code performant with just locks or with atomic instructions? Also are other kernels like FreeBSD using it?<br>
<p>
I don't have anything personal against RCU I'm just genuinely curious.<br>

Atomic instructions and locks are very slow.<br>
<p>
RCU is being used because it allows software to avoid using them and still be correct.<br>
<p>
Everywhere that RCU is being used or considered previously used Atomic instructions and locks, and it's being used because it's so much faster.<br>
<p>
this is a case where doing things the 'simple' way limits it's performance, RCU looks at the problem a different way and comes at the problem sideways to get the desired result with much better performance, but unfortunantly at the cost of complexity.<br>
<p>
RCU actually takes very little run time, it takes a lot of RAM to hold all the extra copies of the data (and all the complexity boils down to figuring out when these extra copies aren't needed any longer)<br>

Think of RCU as MVCC in a database.<br>
<p>
Older database engines just locked tables for updates. That was reliable but slow.<br>
<p>
When MVCC came along it made databases *so much faster*.<br>
<p>
It may be complicated but you wouldn't want to go back.<br>

What older databases? Do you mean RELATIONAL databases?<br>
<p>
While I've had FILE locks available for ever, they're almost never used. RECORD (ie the equivalent of rows) locking has been available and used pretty much since day 1 (day 1 being 1 jan 1967 iirc :-)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

Yes relational databases. I'm thinking something on a PC. I worked with some dbase, Alpha 4, Paradox, BTrieve and Access so it must have been one or more of those.<br>
<p>
Anyway, perhaps it was using row level locking. Which made no difference because the queries I was writing needed that row, so if it was being updated it still brought all the other queries to a complete halt.<br>
<p>
And it seems to me that the indexes got locked during writes too.<br>

Yep, you're still in the stone age. Modern relational databases do not lock tables or records (unless explicitly requested) but use MVCC.<br>

<a href="/Articles/820337/">OSPM</a>
</div>
Frequency scaling — adjusting a CPU's operating frequency to save power when the
workload demands are low — is common practice across systems supported by
Linux.  It 
is, however, viewed with some suspicion in data-center settings, where
power consumption is less of a concern and there is a strong emphasis on
getting the most performance out of the hardware.  At the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), Giovanni Gherdovich worried that
frequency scaling may be about to go extinct in data centers; he made a
plea for improving its behavior for such workloads while there is still
time.
<p>
He started with a quote from a car-rally driver: "if in doubt, go flat
out".  This may not actually be the best advice for drivers of motor
vehicles, he said, but it may be the right approach for frequency
scaling.

Users in data centers often switch to the "performance" CPU-frequency
governor, which is <i>not</i> frequency scaling.  This governor, which
simply runs at full speed all the time, reflects one outcome
of the tension between energy efficiency and raw performance.  Program
managers tend to be interested in performance first, and performance is the
first 
thing that customers see.  The cost of power usage is only discovered
later, resulting in attempts to hack efficiency into a data-center
deployment as an 
afterthought.  It would be better to have that efficiency there from the
outset, he said.
<p>
He asked the audience a question: assume you are a regional bank running an
on-premises data center.  Which CPU-frequency governor would you choose?
The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html">intel_pstate</a>
powersave governor would be the smart choice for now.  But the intel_pstate
performance governor beckons.
The "schedutil" governor is the upcoming next
generation.  Would you pick one of those, or just go with whatever default
the distribution picked?  The choice is not obvious.  Frequency scaling
looks like a risk for a data-center user.  Can the distribution vendor be
trusted to have made the right choice?
For distributors, the bank is a customer who must be catered to.  Which
governor would you set as the default?
<p>
<h4>Mobile-first considered harmful</h4>
<p>
He would like to see frequency scaling be the obvious choice for
data-center users and make the performance governor obsolete.  Eventually
he would like to see the schedutil governor win universally; it's "too cool
not to win".  But that is hampered by the (in his view) mobile-first
viewpoint taken by the developers working with frequency scaling.  The
object is to save every last bit of energy with the idea that the
performance governor exists for users who don't share that goal.  That

<a href="/Articles/820880/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/ospm/GiovanniGherdovich-sm.png" alt="[Giovanni
Gherdovich]" title="Giovanni Gherdovich" class="lthumb"></a>

results in frequency scaling stagnating on the x86 architecture, which is
relatively rare in power-sensitive settings.
<p>
(Your editor, who has been watching for a long time, was amused by this.
For many years the complaint was that "big iron" dominated
kernel-development priorities; that situation would appear to have
changed.)
<p>
So what happens if distributors default to the performance governor for x86
systems?  One advantage would be that the task of getting the powersave
governor into shape could be dropped, along with the complexity that
governor brings.  On the other hand, he said, the x86 community will lose
its grip on technology that it will certainly need someday.  Avoiding the
powersave governor on server systems will simply paper over bugs that, in
the long run, need to be fixed.  The last time this topic came up at SUSE
(where Gherdovich works) the powersave contingent won, but the issue will
come up again.
<p>
It seems, though, that the performance governor isn't an obvious choice
even now.  Dhaval Giani said that it can prevent a CPU from going
into "turbo" mode, causing some benchmarks to regress.  Rafael Wysocki
pointed 
out that frequency scaling is increasingly done in the processor itself,
which can cause strange results when the performance governor is selected.
<p>
Gherdovich answered that there appears to be some tension here.  The
schedutil governor is getting smarter, but the "hardware-managed p-states"
feature (called HWP) is pushing things the other way and taking the kernel
out of the decision loop.

It's not clear
how things will play out, and whether frequency scaling will ultimately be
controlled in the operating system or the firmware.  Wysocki said that the
two approaches are not mutually exclusive, though; the operating system
works at different time scales than HWP does.  It is possible to bring the
two into agreement, but there aren't many ways to provide feedback between
them now.  He has a patch that tries to improve the situation; he will
attempt to post it soon.
<p>
Continuing, Gherdovich said that defaults set by distributors are
critically important; they are the first thing that users see.  A
distribution will be evaluated with its default settings; if the results
are bad, users will move on without ever getting to the point where they
try to tune things.  So distributors tend to emphasize their default
settings when running tests, resulting in far fewer bug reports for
non-default CPU-frequency governors.  If performance is the default,
powersave will get little attention.
Additionally, regressions are not something that can be tolerated; if
frequency scaling is ever turned off, it will be almost impossible to turn
it back on.  The chances of creating performance regressions would just be
too high.
<p>
That, he said, leads to a downward spiral for non-performance CPU-frequency
governors.  The algorithms in those governors will increasingly be tuned
for settings outside of the data center, causing data-center users to lose
confidence in them entirely.  Distributors will just default to
performance, there will be no bug reports, bugs won't get fixed, and
frequency scaling will just get worse.
<p>
<h4>Compromise needed</h4>
<p>
How do we avoid this dark future?  Frequency scaling needs to compromise a
bit in the direction of performance, he said, if it wants to win the data
center.  Often the correct choice for the CPU frequency is obvious, and the
governor should go with it.  But if there is no information available or
the indications conflict with each other, that is the time to favor
performance.  Any other algorithm will be irrelevant on servers.
<p>
For now, he said, the process that is making frequency scaling unsuitable for
data centers has not advanced far, but he worries that the priority
for upstream developers
seems to strongly favor saving power, and he would like to change that
somewhat.  Wysocki said that anybody who sends patches to the kernel has an
agenda — it's why they wrote the patch in the first place.  What
data-center advocates need to do is to respond to patches that show an agenda
falling too heavily on the battery side.
<p>
Gherdovich was seemingly ready for that; he countered by bringing up <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/16144228.tcT5YVROcV%40aspire.rjw.lan/">this
patch</a> merged by Wysocki in 2019.  The "I/O boost" heuristic in the
powersave governor assumes that, if a task has been waiting for I/O, it
will have work to do once that I/O completes, so the governor increases the
processor's operating frequency to get that work done quickly.  Prior to
the patch, it increased the frequency all the way to the maximum;
afterward, the frequency ramps up more slowly.  This patch regresses the
dbench benchmark, Gherdovich said.  Wysocki responded that the purpose of
the patch was to avoid starving the integrated GPU of power, and to match
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a5a0809bc58e">an equivalent
change</a> made to the schedutil governor.
<p>
There may be good reasons for the change, Gherdovich said, but that patch is
currently reverted in SUSE kernels, which is
clearly a stopgap solution.  There are a couple of other out-of-tree
patches in those kernels as well, as it turns out.  The "idle boost" patch
works like I/O boost; it temporarily increases the frequency when a
processor exits the idle state.  The "ramp up faster" change is an old
patch that nobody likes; it causes the frequency to ramp up more quickly
when utilization hits a threshold.  These patches are expensive to
maintain, and SUSE would much rather stick with the mainline.
<p>
Patrick Bellasi asked whether any attempt had been made to use <a
href="/Articles/762043/">uclamp</a> to get the desired performance results;
that has not been done.  Mel Gorman added that uclamp is disabled in SUSE
kernels since it imposes a significant (3-4%) overhead even when it is not
used.  Bellasi (the author of the uclamp work) was evidently surprised by
this and asked for further information, so that problem, at least, may
eventually be fixed.
<p>
Gherdovich concluded by putting up some numbers.  Reverting the I/O-boost
patch
increases dbench performance by 10%, he said.  The performance per
watt of power used drops by 23%, which is not a big problem on a server
system; users typically do not want to lose that 10% of throughput even if
it's costly in 
energy terms.  The full "spicy-powersave" patch set — the I/O boost revert
plus "idle boost" and "ramp up faster" — improves kernel build times by 10%
with no power cost at all.
<p>
At the end, Wysocki asked how much performance data-center users were
willing to lose to save some power; Gherdovich didn't have a precise answer
but did say that 10% is too much.  Wysocki expressed a wish that the
CPU-frequency governor work would, in the end, converge on a single
solution for everybody, probably in the form of the schedutil governor.

<p>
That depends on the datacenter. If you own your own datacenter, and you pay for power, performance per watt may still matter. If you're running on someone else's servers and they don't charge you for power, performance per watt stops mattering, and you may want to pay a disproportionate amount of power to get more performance.<br>

With all the talk about "Total Cost of Ownership" (over 5 or 10 years) coming from AMD, you'd think there'd be more of a focus on performance per watt. Perhaps we need better benchmarks?<br>
<p>
Another thing to keep in mind when designing such benchmarks is that servers are not necessarily active all hours of the day - in the traffic trough, there's less work going on and it's okay to slow down and you can C-state some of your cores...<br>

Nope, no one charge for energy in DC. The bill is usually is an allowed peak load or 95% percentile of that load. Even the electric companies often charge DC based on contracted power (watts), not the energy (joules or kw*hr, like household bills). The reason is that dc reserves specific power from supplier, and that power is often billed as 'take or pay', as it is not oversubscribed on the supplier capacity.<br>

This sounds like it's also what allows these cloud companies to basically give away their CPU time to CI infrastructure to FOSS for free. Since the extra CPU usage doesn't actually cost them more in resources, they can instead buy some goodwill with the cycles instead (sure there's some personnel overhead, but once it's built out I suspect that it isn't too much to tack it onto the bottom of the sysadmin team's laundry list).<br>

This can vary per colo provider. "Metered power" (which should really be called "metered energy") contracts are available. I can't speak to their relative prevalence, but they are common enough to matter.<br>
<p>
<a href="https://www.greenhousedata.com/blog/colocation-pricing-explained-the-shift-towards-metered-billing">https://www.greenhousedata.com/blog/colocation-pricing-ex...</a><br>
<p>
My own experience with being on a "metered power" contract, and from looking at several competitive offers, is that the rent was on the order of 2/3 of the total bill. Since the rent is fixed for the duration of the contract, this limited the potential immediate savings from power reduction to 1/3. That said, being at a lower power level is good when it comes time to get the next contract, though of course colo providers will charge lower $/kW for higher kW allotments, so the savings are not linear. Different contracts from different providers in different locations at different times will vary....<br>
<p>
<p>
Regarding use of frequency scaling on servers, running at higher frequencies means being able to get each unit of work done more quickly, which means being able to spend more time in higher C states. It's been a while since I measured this, but back on Sandy Bridge servers, using the performance governor resulted in substantially more time in higher C states, which presumably partially offset the increased power usage from higher frequencies. Also, as CPU usage gets higher, the difference between governors becomes lower, and it is good to consolidate workloads until CPUs have a meaningful load anyway, in order to avoid wasted servers. With all that, I don't hesitate to use the performance governor on tiers where latency matters at all; on the other hand, anything asynchronous (e.g. kafka) or high-latency (e.g. email) can generally use ondemand with no real downside.<br>
<p>
All of this comes down to a business decision: determine your needs, measure the impact, calculate the cost, and make a decision. Having a less conservative governor would simply be another option to measure, and that doesn't sound like a bad thing.<br>

To what extent could this depend on whether the system is currently running on battery? If you're running on battery, you may want a default policy of "save as much power as possible", albeit that needs to not cause increased power usage overall on a workload (such as making something take 30% longer to save 5% power, which is not a win if you're trying to get that workload done before you run out of battery). If you're running on mains power (and you're not in the "large datacenter with substantial power and cooling costs that you're paying for" use case), you may want more affordances for performance.<br>
<p>
Back in the say, making *anything* conditional on "running on battery" was seen as a mistake. Is that still true today, though? Might that help make defaults work for more people?<br>

Unfortunately the workload of browsers is to take a lot of CPU permanently so that websites can run their useless js.<br>
<p>
In the case of browsers, the entire idea of making the CPU running faster to get the work done sooner does not work, because it's just endless loops all over the place.<br>

That's a problem to be solved in browsers. The OS's job is to run the workloads given to it, and to attempt to balance power and performance in doing so.<br>

Weird. I love defaults that work in every case but power has obviously very different "prices" depending on the context:<br>
<p>
1. Super expensive because I absolutely need my battery to last at least the day<br>
2. Somewhat expensive because my data center charges me - yet I value happy customers more.<br>
3. A bit "expensive" because I don't want to get up from the couch and look for my charger<br>
4. Free because my data center doesn't charge me.<br>
Etc.<br>
<p>
OK, we probably don't want 5 or 10 different power settings like some Windows OEMs provide but two settings ("I care" vs "I don't care much") seems like a really bare minimum.<br>

Running a datacentre with no power management at all seems exceptionally short-sighted. Sure, you *can* spec a gargantuan HVAC that can handle a sustained 200-300 watts of TDP per 1U, but if your room's constantly at thermal capacity like that then so are your systems.<br>
<p>
I'm surprised the intel_pstate driver performs inconsistently enough to merit all this discourse in the first place. I just tried flipping between schedutil and performance on my Zen2 (using the bog-standard ACPI driver) and the turbostat numbers are more or less identical under load and idle for both, and the chip's overall productivity is too.<br>

No frequency scaling doesn't mean no power management; C-states are still enabled by default. Maximum frequency with C-states enabled is basically the "race to idle" policy which is not a bad policy.<br>

I used to work with HFT systems in colocation space worldwide.  We always paid by the cabinet, with tiered options for available power.  So you pay for the peak wattage, and the datacenter is built to handle whatever heat load they think is going to eventuate (that was totally not our problem).<br>
<p>
There's basically zero incentive to save power, and literally millions of dollars of incentive to ensure that the system is maximally responsive to demand at every microsecond of the day, from 7am Monday in Auckland until 5pm in New York on Friday.<br>
<p>
So, yeah, it probably does mean that the datacenter has a massively over-provisioned HVAC, but ... there's no demand to do anything about it.<br>
<p>
If you're a FAANG, running your own fleet of datacenters, the calculations are probably different.<br>

We've just had a lengthy discussion on this topic (dc business). The conclusion was that it's all overcomplicated. C states, p states, power governor, idle governor, power driver, idle driver, cpufreq, intel_pstate, ondeman governor which worse than powersave, etc, etc.<br>
<p>
The opinion was that this is just too much for a simple feature to save some power. So we've opted for unconditional performance.<br>
<p>
It would be nice to have a way to trim power a bit, but not at cost of years of stidy of that spaghetti bowl of leaking abstractions and hardware wishthinking.<br>
<p>
I appreciate efforts of kernel people a lot, but whole powersaving saga demands more that returns back.<br>

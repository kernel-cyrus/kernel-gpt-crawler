</div>
Memory-management (MM) patches are notoriously difficult to get merged into the
mainline kernel.  They are subjected to a high degree of review because
this is an area where it is easy to get things wrong.  Or, at least, that
is how it used to be.  The final memory-management session at the 2017
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit was concerned with
patch review in the MM subsystem — or the lack of it.
<p>
Michal Hocko started the session off by saying that too many patches get
into Andrew Morton's &#8209;mm tree without proper review.  Fully half of them,
he said, lack an <tt>Acked-by</tt> or <tt>Reviewed-by</tt> tag.  But that
is only part of the problem: even when patches <i>do</i> carry tags
indicating that review has been done, that review is often superficial at
best, focusing on little details.  Reviewers are not taking the time to
think about the real problem, he said.  As a result, MM developers are
"building hacks on other hacks because nobody remembers why they were added
in the first place".
<p>
As an example, he raised memory hotplug, and the care that is taken when
shifting pages between memory zones.  But much of that could be avoided by
simply not assigning pages to zones as early as happens now.  MM developers
were used to working around this issue, he said, and so never really looked
into it.  In the end, this is turning the MM subsystem into an
unmaintainable mess that is getting worse over time.  How, he asked, can we
get more review for MM patches, as befits a core kernel subsystem?  How can
we get review that really matters, and how can we force submitters to fix
the problems that are found?
<p>
<!--
Rik van Riel started off by describing a big problem he encounters when
reviewing patches: he can often see what a patch does, but he has no idea
of why it is doing that.  This is a common problem, Hocko replied,
especially when non-MM developers try to implement new features.
<p> -->
One option, Hocko said, is to make it mandatory that every MM patch have at
least one review tag.  That, he said, is likely to slow things down
considerably.  There are 100-150 MM patches merged in each development
cycle; if the 50% or so of them without review tags are held back, a lot
less will get merged.  Is the community OK with that?
<p>
Kirill Shutemov said that, if reviews are required to get patches merged,
there will also need to be a way to get developers to do those reviews.
Hocko agreed, saying that few developers are reviewing patches now.  Mel

Gorman said that requiring reviews might be fair, but there should be one
exception: when developers modify their own code.  In general, the
principal author should not need as much review for subsequent
modifications.
<p>
Morton said that a lot of patches do not really require review; many of
them are trivial in nature.  When review does happen, he said, the quality
can vary considerably; there are some <tt>Reviewed-by</tt> tags that he
doesn't believe at all.  Gorman agreed that reviews need to have some merit
to be counted.
<p>
Johannes Weiner worried that requiring reviews could cause work to fall
through the cracks.  Obscure bug fixes might not get merged, and
memory-hotplug work could languish.  Memory hotplug is a particular
"problem child", Morton said; there is a lot of drive-by work and he has no
idea who can review it.  Quite a few people, Hocko added, are pursuing
their own use case and don't really care about the rest.  Part of the
problem, Morton said, is that nobody really wants to clean up memory
hotplug and, even if they did, they don't have the hardware platforms that
would allow them to test the result.
<p>
Gorman said that it is important to start enforcing some sort of rule
around review.  Patches that still need review should have a special tag in
the -mm tree.  If the percentage of patches so tagged is too high when the
-rc5 prepatch comes out, developers who have pending patches should be
conscripted to do some review work.  That would, at least, encourage the
active developers to do a bit more review work.
<p>
Hocko then went back to the issue of trivial patches which, he said, are a
bigger problem than many people think.  Many of them are broken in obscure
ways and create problems.  Gorman suggested simply dropping trivial patches
that have no user impact.  Morton said that he could make an effort to be
more careful when taking those patches, but that his attempts to get
reviews for these patches are often ignored.  If the people who have
touched a certain file ignore a patch to it, Gorman said, that patch should
just be dropped.
<p>
Morton replied that he is reluctant to mandate a system where it's
impossible to get changes into the kernel if you can't get them reviewed.
People get busy or take vacations, and many of those patches are changes
that we want 
anyway.  Dropping them would be detrimental to the kernel as a whole.
Hocko said that
XFS is now mandating reviews for all changes, and it doesn't appear to be
suffering from patches being dropped on the floor.
<p>
The discussion then shifted to high-level design review, with Hocko saying
that high-level review is hard and he wishes we had more of it, but it is
not the biggest problem.  The real issue is that we have more submitters of
changes than reviewers of those changes.  Morton said that he would push
harder to get patches reviewed, and would do a walk-through around -rc5 to
try to encourage review for specific patches needing it.
<p>
Morton said there are particular problems around specific patch sets that
never seem to get enough review.  <a href="/Articles/717614/">Heterogeneous
memory management</a> is one of those; it is massive, and somebody spent a
lot of time on it, but there don't seem to be a whole lot of other people
who care about it.  The longstanding <a
href="/Articles/684611/"><tt>ZONE_CMA</tt></a> patches are another
example.  There is a demand for this work, but it has been blocked, he
said, partly because Gorman doesn't like it.  Gorman replied that he still
thinks it's not a good idea, and "you're going to get a kicking from it",
but if the people who want that feature want to maintain it, they should go
for it; it doesn't affect others.  So he will not block the merging of that
code.
<p>
Hocko raised the topic of the hugetlbfs code, which is complex to the point
that few developers want to touch it.  Perhaps, he said, hugetlbfs should
be put into maintenance mode with no new features allowed.  The consensus
on this idea seemed to be that the MM developers should say "no more" to
changes in this area, but not try to impose strict rules.
<p>
Another conclusion came from Morton, who encouraged the MM developers to be
more vocal on the mailing lists.  The volume on the linux-mm list is
reasonable, so there is no real excuse for not paying attention to what is
happening there.  Developers should, he said, "hit reply more often".
Gorman agreed, but said that there need to be consequences from those
replies; if a developer pushes back on a patch, that patch needs to be
rethought.
<p>
By that time, the end of LSFMM was in sight, and thoughts of beer began to
take over.  Whether this discussion leads to better review of MM patches
remains to be seen, but it has, if nothing else, increased awareness of the
problem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

"Mel [Michal Hocko] Gorman said that requiring reviews might be fair, but there should be one exception: when developers modify their own code."<br>
<p>
I very strongly disagree with this statement, from our experience in the drm subsystem, for bunch of reasons:<br>
- If your intimitadely familiar with some code you tend to have an illusion that you know everything. I stopped counting the embarrassing stuff I've missed in patches for code I entirely designed myself.<br>
- If your the expert, you need to share your knowledge. Best way to do that is by explaining all the tricky details to a reviewer, and the reviewer making sure it's all properly documented, commented as needed and functions/variables all have meaningful names fully capturing all the details.<br>
- Often author == maintainer, so your primary reviewer. If you want to kickstart a real, working review market in your community, then the easiest way to pull that off is by subjecting yourself to it. That way new folks learn the art of review, and there's a direct benefit for them since you can return the favour in reviewing their patches. After a few months/years and increasingly encouraging contributors to just cross-review you have a review market where you as maintainer can entirely concentrate on high-level design issues.<br>
- On top, if review is only a hazing ritual for outsiders and doesn't apply for core contributors, it will discourage new contributors. Leading by example and all that.<br>
<p>
Because of this we have a hard rule in drm/i915 and the drm core that you don't get to merge your own crap without review, ever. We're rolling that rule out (slowly) to all the drivers now, which means we're kickstarting a much bigger review market for drm drivers. It works (just takes a bit of time).<br>

      <p>I've seen in code review elsewhere that it's often good to have the new person review the expert's code. Two interesting things happen:
<ol>
<li>The new person asks "stupid" questions. 90% of the time, this leads to the new person's misapprehensions being corrected, because there's something non-obvious going on here, which ensures that they write better code than they would have done without the correction. The other 10% of the time, the new person simply doesn't have a piece of history that biases them into ignoring a bad pattern, and points out a genuine issue.
<li>The fact that new people are going to be doing reviews shifts the culture of the group towards clear, appropriately documented code - you know that the reviewers are going to need to acquire context to review your code, and you shift towards ensuring that it's easy for them to acquire that context. Side benefit is that future potential contributors find it easier to gain the context they need to submit something useful.

It all boils down to the three most important things every engineer must do at all times: communicate, communicate, and communicate. Not tersely and not ad nauseum; rather, sufficiently and adequately. Communicate the idea/concept. Communicate your thoughts. And tell 'em what you're telling 'em. Basically, describe the problem or solution description from three different angles.<br>
<p>
Remember that interpersonal written/verbal communication *is* programming; the speaker/writer is programming the listener/reader to construct a mental image. Thus, the human brain, being the pattern matcher that it is, will construct a 'picture'. If the brain has received adequate instructions , the picture will be largely complete and apparent flaws will stand out.<br>

Code must not only be reviewed. It must also be reviewable.<br>

For most people this metaphor is just completely wrong. Programming is conscious and intentional: interpersonal communication is a theory-of-mind thing for which there is inbuilt neural assistance, and determining how to modify that model is <i>not</i> done consciously. (Which is a good thing, because those of us who do have to do it consciously are mostly terrible at it as a result.)

<p>
You might be terrible at "interpersonal communication", (by which I assume you mean spoken communication with aural/visual cues) but from what I've seen, your written communication is superb. It also gives, may I say, a clear (and edifying) impression of the person behind it.<br>
<p>
Good documentation (and authoring in general) requires being able to think yourself into the shoes of the reader. Some are better at that than others, and practice makes perfect, but it's always going to require conscious thought and effort. Good engineering communication, rather than just code-churning, is no exception.<br>

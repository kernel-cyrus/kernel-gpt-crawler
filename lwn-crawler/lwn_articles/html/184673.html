<h1>Virtualization: now what?</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Serge Hallyn recently posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184383/">a
new version of the UTS namespaces patch</a>.  This code, a small part of
the "lightweight virtualization" or "containers" concept, allows various
bits of system naming information (the stuff which can be seen with
<tt>uname</tt>, essentially) to differ between sets of processes on the
same system.  It may not seem like a big thing, but, as a piece of
container technology which has received the approval of several projects
working in this area, it gives a hint of how the larger problem might be
solved.
<p>

Andrew Morton responded with <a href="/Articles/184674/">a note praising
the way the work has been done</a>, but asking a fundamental question:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Generally, I think that the whole approach of virtualising the OS
	so it can run multiple independent instances of userspace is a good
	one.  It's an extension and a strengthening of things which Linux
	is already doing and it pushes further along a path we've been
	taking for many years.  If done right, it's even possible that each
	of these featurettes could improve the kernel in its own right -
	better layering, separation, etc. [...]
	<p>
	All of which begs the question "now what?".
</div>
<p>

The worry is that the kernel developers could merge a large amount of
non-trivial code, make a number of internal kernel interfaces more
complicated, and still not have an end result that is useful to the
containers community.  The fact that the developers working in this area
were able to agree on a patch for UTS namespaces is encouraging, but it is
not a guarantee that consensus will be reached on the more complicated
changes.  The possibility of an intractable disagreement derailing the
whole process partway through is a real one.
<p>
On the other hand, keeping all of the container code out of the kernel
until it is reasonably complete has its own costs.  Some of the container
changes look to be relatively large and intrusive.  Maintaining them all
out of the tree would not be a great deal of fun.  Neither would merging
the whole mess at some future point when enough developers can agree that
they are "done."
<p>
There are a number of features needed by the projects concerned with
virtualization and containers.  They include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The UTS namespace patch mentioned above.
<p>
<li> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/171017/">PID virtualization</a>,
     isolating each group of processes on the system from each other, and
     allowing process IDs to be reused between containers.
<p>
<li> Namespaces for SYSV interprocess communication primitives (semaphores,
     shared memory, and message queues).
<p>
<li> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/180375/">Time virtualization</a>, so
     that each container can have its own idea of what time it is.
<p>
<li> Virtualization of user and group ID values.
<p>
<li> Network namespaces, intended to give each container a specific set of
     network interfaces to which it has access.  When used in conjunction
     with IP aliases, this feature can set up a separate IP address for
     each container and keep containers from accessing each others'
     traffic.
</ul>
<p>
The ability to virtualize the view of the filesystem through namespaces is
also required, but Linux has had that capability for some years now.  Some
of the more advanced container capabilities - live checkpointing and
process migration, for example - will require yet another set of deep
kernel hooks.
<p>
Most container concepts need most of the items from the list above to be
able to provide useful isolation.  So, somehow, a path must be found to get
those features into the kernel without running into a blocking disagreement
partway through - assuming that container support is considered desirable
in general, of course.
<p>
Andrey Savochkin came up with <a href="/Articles/184682/">a proposal</a>
which could be a good step forward: implement the network namespaces
feature first.  It is one of the most complex features, and it must be
implemented in a way which doesn't upset the highly refined sensibilities
of the networking subsystem developers.  Some fairly tricky side problems -
such as virtualizing access to <tt>/proc</tt> and sysfs - will have to be
solved in the process.  All told, it may be the hardest part of the
problem, and it may be the place where an extended disagreement is most
likely to show up.
<p>
Often, developers like to take on the easier parts of a problem first,
then apply any lessons learned to the harder parts.  In this case, however,
starting with the hardest part may make some sense.  If no universally
acceptable solution can be found, the idea of generalized container support
in the kernel can be dropped before too much other code has been merged.
If, instead, the developers involved are able to implement something which
pleases (or, at least, does not mortally offend) everybody, they should be
able to get over any other roadblocks which may show up later on.  In that
case, the various pieces of the puzzle could be merged with confidence as
they become ready.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Dumb question of somebody not involved in kernel development...<br>
<p>
Wouldn't these changes not be big enough to start Linux 3.0 development (maybe call it 2.9 or 2.99 until it's stable enough for 3.0) and keep the 2.6 branch for driver additions some other "smaller" changes and bug/security fixes which are relativley easy to forward port later?<br>

      <p>Why branch when you can do both in the same tree? Disable the 
macro/configuration option and you have 2.6, enabled it and you 
have '3.0'. Until '3.0' becomes '2.6'.</p>

<p>That's how the preemptable kernel stuff works at least.</p>

      I thought the OpenVZ submission already supported a lot of these features?<br>

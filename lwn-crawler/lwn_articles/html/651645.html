<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 21, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel development community is quite good at adding code to the
kernel; its record on removing code is not always quite so bright.  There
are all kinds of reasons why removing code can be difficult; often, even
code that appears to be without use stays around just in case somebody,
somewhere, still needs it.  Removal can be hard even when there is a known
replacement that should work for all users; that can be seen in the case of
the ext3 filesystem.
<p>
A few eyebrows went up when Jan Kara <a href="/Articles/651072/">posted a
patch</a> removing the ext3 filesystem recently.  Some users clearly
thought the move represented a forced upgrade to ext4; Randy Dunlap <a
href="/Articles/651647/">remarked that</a> "<q>this looks like an
April&nbsp;1 joke to me</q>".  In truth, it is neither a joke nor a
forced upgrade; it is, however, an interesting story to look back at.
<p>
Nine years ago, in the middle of 2006, the premier filesystem for most
users was ext3, but that filesystem was showing its age in a few ways.
Its 32-bit block pointers limited maximum filesystem size to 8TB, a limit
that was not too restrictive for most users at the time, but which would be
highly problematic today.  The filesystem tracks blocks in files with
individual pointers, leading to large amounts of metadata overhead and poor
performance on
larger files.  These problems, along with a number of missing features, had
long since convinced developers that something newer and better was
required.
<p>
For a while, some thought that might be a filesystem called reiser4, but
that story failed to work out well even before that filesystem's primary
developer left the development community.

<p>
The ext3 developers came up with <a href="/Articles/187321/">a number of
patches</a> aimed at easing its scalability problems.  These patches were
made directly against the ext3 filesystem, with the idea that ext3 would
evolve in the direction that was needed.  There was, however, <a
href="/Articles/187336/">some resistance</a> to the idea of making major
changes to ext3 from developers who valued that filesystem in its current,
stable form.  One of those developers, it <a
href="/Articles/187349/">turned out</a>, was Linus who, as we all know, has
a relatively strong voice in such decisions.
<p>
And so it came to be that the ext3 developers <a
href="/Articles/189950/">announced</a> their intent to create a new
filesystem called "ext4"; all new-feature development would be done there.
Actually, the new filesystem was first called "ext4dev" to emphasize its
experimental nature; the plan was to rename it to "ext4" once things were
stable, "<q>probably in 6-9 months</q>".  In the real world, that <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/03010a3350301baac2154fa66de925ae2981b7e3">renaming</a>
happened nearly 28 months later and was merged for the 2.6.28 kernel.
<p>
Since then, of course, ext4 has become the primary Linux filesystem for
many users.  It has seen many new features added, and it is not clear that
this process will stop, even though ext4 is now in the same position that
ext3 was nine years ago.  Through this entire history, though, ext4 has
retained the ability to mount and manage ext2 and ext3 filesystems; it can
be configured to do so transparently in the absence of the older ext2 and
ext3 modules.  And, indeed, many distributions now don't bother to build
the older filesystem modules, relying on ext4 to manage all three versions
of the filesystem.
<p>
Back when ext4 was created, it was envisioned that the older filesystem
code would eventually become unnecessary.  The plan was that when this
happened, "<q>perhaps 12-18 months out<q>", the ext3 code would be
removed.  Once again, reality had something different to say, and the ext3
code endured for over nine years.  Unless something surprising happens,
though, that record is about to come to an end; ext3 could be removed as
soon as the 4.3 development cycle, taking some 28,000 lines of code with
it.  And most users, even those with ext3 filesystems, will not even
notice. 
<p>
One might well wonder whether we will see a similar story in the future and
the addition of an ext5 filesystem.  For the time being, that does not seem
to be in the works.  Ext4 has picked up a number of features in recent
years, with <a href="/Articles/639427/">encryption</a> as the most recent
example, but there has been no talk of moving development to a new source
base.  Over the years, perhaps, the ext4 developers have done well enough
at not breaking things that users are less worried about new development
than they once might have been.
<p>
At the other end, there is the question of the ext2 filesystem.  That code,
too, could be replaced by ext4, but there seems to be no pressure to do
so.  Ext2 is small, weighing in at less than 10,000 lines of code; ext3 and
the associated JBD journaling code come in at 28,000, while ext4
and JBD2 add up to closer to 60,000 lines.  The
simplicity of ext2 
makes it a good filesystem for developers to experiment with, and its
maintenance cost is nearly zero.  So there is no real reason to take it out
anytime soon.
<p>
Ext3, being rather larger than ext2, is a more promising target to remove,
though Jan 
<a href="/Articles/651649/">said</a> that its maintenance cost was pretty
low.  The fact that this code has been so thoroughly replaced makes the
removal decision relatively easy — but that decision still took nine years
to come about.  Even so, if all old kernel code were this easy to
get rid of, the kernel would be quite a bit smaller than it is today.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I agree. I don't think, either, that the article should have gone into details. I'm just amused that the wording suggests that it was Reiser's decision by omission of the circumstances. I'd feel the same if anyone wrote that George Coe would "no longer be performing as Woodhouse in any future Archer episodes." *Usually*, when someone leaves a development community, it's a personal, interpersonal, or work-related decision.<br>

As for stuff being left around "just in case it is needed", in early 2013 I had to get data off an MiniScribe MFM disk. (For youngsters, MFM was before IDE, which was before ATA which was before SATA.) The controller card was a PC XT card which could fit in a Pentium, with manually configured IRQ and removing the ROM, and fixing up the IN TREE driver, it WORKED, and extracted the data from the disk, with some help from ddrescue. The next kernel cycle the driver was deleted, because of being ancient, but I still for one was grateful for it being kept around.<br>

I 100% agree with your implied opinion that drivers shouldn't be removed because they aren't used.  The major difference here is that there is still an in-tree driver that will handle ext3 -- and that is the ext4 driver.<br>

yeah, but for stupidly old hardware it pretty much implies there is no need to be running the latest kernel, so what would have been the problem if your driver was removed 5 years earlier when you still can get the old kernel source?<br>

getting the rest of the distro to install along with the kernel so that you can use it.<br>

<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/">http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/</a> If the data on the disk is that important then fuffying around getting an old distro to install definitly sounds worth it.<br>

Bit rot. There is always some extra modern tool you need to compile (like ddrescue). And it need modern library deps too. The GCC for userspace is built with headers for some kernel version, forcing you to have an old toolchain too. And then it turns out that doesn't compile or run because the ABI changed. All of a sudden you're in an all-out legacy land trying to make things compile. That is usually a waste of time compared to just using the latest of everything, like you do every day.<br>

Honestly, I think that in these very special scenarios, it's just fine to use a very old kernel (eg: grab a Debian image from 10 years ago).<br>
<p>
There's no need to run the latest kernel, and I don't think you'll be using that hardware for much more than copying your data.<br>

<p>
A less extreme example is my NAS, which has a PATA port with a flash drive installed. It requires the "Legacy PATA" driver to work... slowly. Unfortunately stock Debian kernel does not have this module enabled so I'm forced to compile special kernels for this one machine.<br>

      I very recently pulled a SCSI hard drive out of my old Amiga 3000 and was able to get linux to mount the Amiga partitioned 5 volumes and read the whole 200MB of data there, some of which was actually useful to have again. I'm very glad those old linux kernel pieces were still available to make this possible. (It's not like the Amiga end of things has changed much in the last 20 years.)

           </div>
As the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust-for-Linux project</a>
advances, the kernel is gradually 
accumulating abstraction layers that enable Rust code to interface with the
existing C code.  As the discussion around the set of <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20231018122518.128049-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">filesystem
abstractions</a> posted by Wedson Almeida Filho in December shows, though,
there is some tension between two approaches to the design of those
abstractions.  The approach favored by most of the kernel's C programmers
looks set to win out, but this is a discussion that is likely to return as
the use of Rust in the kernel grows.
<p>
If a Rust developer wants to implement a filesystem using the posted
abstractions, their job will be to put together an implementation that
looks like this example taken from the cover letter:
<p>
<pre>
    impl FileSystem for MyFS {
        fn super_params(sb: &amp;NewSuperBlock&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;SuperParams&lt;Self::Data&gt;&gt;;
        fn init_root(sb: &amp;SuperBlock&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;ARef&lt;INode&lt;Self&gt;&gt;&gt;;
        fn read_dir(inode: &amp;INode&lt;Self&gt;, emitter: &amp;mut DirEmitter) -&gt; Result;
        fn lookup(parent: &amp;INode&lt;Self&gt;, name: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;ARef&lt;INode&lt;Self&gt;&gt;&gt;;
        fn read_folio(inode: &amp;INode&lt;Self&gt;, folio: LockedFolio&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The functions defined here perform the tasks that the kernel might ask of a
filesystem implementation: <tt>read_dir()</tt> to read directory contents,
for example, or <tt>lookup()</tt> to look up a file name within a
directory.  All of these operations are defined as part of a single trait
called <tt>FileSystem</tt>.
<p>
This organization differs from how the API is defined for C code, where
file and filesystem-related operations are spread out across a wide range
of object types.  A filesystem as a whole is defined by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1192"><tt>struct
super_block</tt></a>, which has a set of associated operations in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L2059"><tt>struct
super_operations</tt></a>.  But filesystems implement a number of other
object types and related operations, including inodes (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L639"><tt>inode</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1968"><tt>inode_operations</tt></a>),
directory entries (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/dcache.h#L82"><tt>dentry</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/dcache.h#L128"><tt>dentry_operations</tt></a>),
files (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L992"><tt>file</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1916"><tt>file_operations</tt></a>),
and address spaces (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L448"><tt>address_space</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L404"><tt>address_space_operations</tt></a>).
<p>
As an example of how the object model works on the C side, consider that
<tt>lookup()</tt> is an inode operation,
<tt>iterate_shared()</tt> (used to implement the <tt>read_dir()</tt>
function defined in the Rust trait) is a file
operation, and <tt>read_folio()</tt> is an address-space operation.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZT7BPUAxsHQ%2FH%2FHm@casper.infradead.org/">had a
couple of questions</a> about the proposed abstractions, starting with the
<tt>inode</tt> parameter to a number of the operations.  In the kernel's C
code, those functions take a <tt>struct inode</tt> pointer, which is quickly
converted into a filesystem-specific structure pointer.  There is little in
the way of type safety here; a function cannot know that it was actually
passed a pointer to the right sort of inode.  In Rust, it seems, it should
be possible to do better.
<p>
Almeida <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CANeycqrm1KCH=hOf2WyCg8BVZkX3DnPpaA3srrajgRfz0x=PiQ@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>
that this interface does, indeed, do better.  The type of the
<tt>inode</tt> parameter is <tt>&amp;INode&lt;Self&gt;</tt>, which ties the
actual type of that parameter to the filesystem type; it is not possible to
pass the wrong type of inode to those functions without running into
compilation errors.
<p>
Wilcox's other question proved harder to answer, though.  The file
operation used (in C code) to read a directory is:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*iterate_shared) (struct file *, struct dir_context *);
</pre>
<p>
The equivalent in the Rust code (<tt>read_dir()</tt>, above) takes an inode
reference as a parameter rather than a <tt>struct file</tt> pointer.
Wilcox pointed out that, while "<q>toy filesystems</q>" get away with
just the information stored in the inode, others need the information in
the <tt>file</tt> structure.  Not keeping that structure in the interface
thus seems a bit strange.

Almeida answered that the filesystems that have been implemented in Rust,
to date, do not need anything from <tt>struct file</tt>; he added:
"<q>Passing a `file` to `read_dir` would require us to introduce an
unnecessary abstraction that no one uses, which we've been told not to
do</q>".  But, he said, the interface could be changed if and when it
becomes necessary.
<p>
Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZZWhQGkl0xPiBD5%2F@casper.infradead.org/">responded</a>
in fairly strong terms:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Then we shouldn't merge any of this, or even send it out for review
	again until there is at least one non-toy filesystems implemented.
	Either stick to the object orientation we've already defined (ie
	separate aops, iops, fops, ... with substantially similar
	arguments) or propose changes to the ones we have in C.  Dealing
	only with toy filesystems is leading you to bad architecture.
</blockquote>
<p>
Almeida <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CANeycqo1v8MYFdmyHfLfiuPAHFWEw80pL7WmEfgXweqKfofp4Q@mail.gmail.com/">was
not pleased</a> by this message; he asked: "<q>Are [you] saying that Rust
cannot have different APIs with the same performance characteristics as
C's, unless we also fix the C apis?</q>"  Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZZYOkCyujEaR7TdX@casper.infradead.org/">replied</a>
that the kernel's object model exists for a reason, and that the Rust side
should not change that model without a strong justification.  Al Viro <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240103195358.GK1674809@ZenIV/">added</a> that the
existing set of objects and operations needed to be treated "<q>as
externally given</q>"; they can be changed with good reason, he said, but
no such reason exists here.
<p>
Kent Overstreet, instead, <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ulideurkqeiqztorsuvhynsrx2np7ohbmnx5nrddzl7zze7qpu@cg27bqalj7i5/">argued</a>
that the Rust abstractions are a way to design a cleaner interface, and
that this interface should not need to match the C API.  Cleaning up the
latter is "<q>a giant hassle</q>" due to the need to change all existing
filesystems at the same time, while creating something better in Rust is
relatively easy.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So instead, it would seem easier to me to do the cleaner version on
	the Rust side, and then once we know what that looks like, maybe we
	update the C version to match - or maybe we light it all on fire
	and continue with rewriting everything in Rust.
</blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile, Almeida <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CANeycqrazDc_KKffx3c4C1yKCuSHU14v+L+2wq-pJq+frRf2wg@mail.gmail.com/">complained</a>
that passing a <tt>file</tt> structure into <tt>read_dir()</tt> when
nothing uses it is just the sort of thing the Rust developers have been
advised to avoid.  Those developers have long been contending with the
problem of merging abstractions so that they can be used without being able
to merge the users at the same time.  Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZZ2dsiK77Se65wFY@casper.infradead.org/">answered</a>
that the advice had been misunderstood; the Rust developers have been asked
not to merge abstractions for which there are no users, not to change the
interfaces for the abstractions they <i>are</i> merging.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/2024010935-tycoon-baggage-a85b@gregkh/">concurred</a>,
saying that the abstractions should be suitable for all filesystems, not
just those that have been implemented now.  Dave Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZZ3GeehAw%2F78gZJk@dread.disaster.area/">said</a>
that this problem is exactly why he has been suggesting that the Rust
developers reimplement ext2, since that filesystem, while being relatively
simple, uses most of the core filesystem API.
<p>
Eventually, Almeida <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CANeycqrubugocT0ZEhcUY4H+kytzhm-E4-PoWtvNobYr32auDA@mail.gmail.com/">gave
in</a>, and said that he would make a new version of the abstractions with
separate file, inode, and address-space traits; <tt>read_dir()</tt>
will be updated to take a <tt>File&lt;T&gt;</tt> reference instead.  Wilcox
<a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZZ6T6aBjOf+vA9sB@casper.infradead.org/">agreed</a>
that this approach seemed like the right way forward.
<p>
So this particular discussion appears to have come to a resolution.  But
implementing kernel functionality in Rust is sure to provide innumerable
opportunities to create new interfaces that are cleaner and safer than
those that have evolved over decades in the kernel's C code.  Sometimes
those APIs will demonstrate misunderstandings about why the C code evolved
the way it did; sometimes they will truly be better.  But, either way, a
Rust API that differs significantly from the C API will make maintenance
and future development harder, so there will
continue to be strong resistance to the idea of creating APIs on the Rust
side that differ from what is done on the C side.
<p>
One answer, as was also <a href="/Articles/952029/">discussed</a> at the
2023 Maintainers Summit, is to evolve the C code to match the better
interfaces being developed for Rust.  The idea makes some sense, but it is
also asking Rust developers to do large amounts of work — in C, which is
just the thing they are trying to get away from.  Changing core kernel
APIs, updating all users of those APIs, and obtaining acceptance for the
changes will not be a task for the faint of heart.  Such a policy would
undoubtedly impede the development of better interfaces on the Rust side;
the result would be more maintainability, but that comes at a real cost.
<p>
What seems likely to happen at some point was alluded to by Overstreet
above: "<q>light it all on fire and continue with rewriting everything in
Rust</q>".  There is no problem with API divergence if the API used by
everybody is in the Rust code.  Your editor's predictive powers are
severely limited, but a couple of things seem likely to happen: there will
be proposals to replace some core code with Rust implementations at some
point, and the resistance to doing so will be fierce.  Even in this
discussion, David Howells <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1080086.1704413050@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">made it
clear</a> that he didn't want to see Rust anywhere near the core kernel.
<p>
That, though, is a discussion for a future time; Rust will have to prove
itself at the edges of the kernel first.  But once the camel's nose (or the
crab's) is in the tent, the rest seems likely to want to follow.  Stay
tuned, it is going to be interesting.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The fact that this conversation is happening at all is an indication of how far Rust integration has already gone. 5 years ago, this is not the sort of thing that LKML would even be seriously discussing. That doesn't necessarily mean that Rust will actually become a part of the core kernel, but it is impressive how swiftly the Rust integration has advanced. Who is to say where it will be in another 5 years?<br>

<p>
Not sure if I agree with the paragraph here - in general, changing your legacy interface to match the newer interface so you can replace it, if you can do it, can make refactors easier. The kernel doesn't really care too much about external ABIs being stable, after all. And if your refactor is applying the strangler fig pattern to replace the old thing... (in this case, Rust over C)<br>

Can't the Rustaceans define a CFilesystem for the kernel, and implement it in terms of their own Filesystem?<br>
<p>
I can think of a couple of reasons why this might not be a good idea, mostly efficiency, but if the Rustaceans are right they don't need it, then they just ditch the CFilesystem interface.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; One answer, as was also discussed at the 2023 Maintainers Summit, is to evolve the C code to match the better interfaces being developed for Rust.

<p>
I wouldn't ask the Rust developers to do the work in C. If they truly believe that putting read_folio in the super_operations is the right model, and they can convince the rest of us, I'm happy to put in the work on the C side.<br>
<p>
This is obviously a bad idea, but it is what was being proposed. I'm not convinced that the a_ops and i_ops actually need to be separate, but it isn't something I've spent a lot of time thinking about, and could easily be convinced either way.<br>

Linux is already full of forks. Android, the M1 kernel with the rust GPU driver, etc. The genius of Linus was to realize that forks are often a good thing and write a version control system to keep a handle on it. Many Android features have made it upstream thanks to this. <br>
<p>
I think rust-based drivers will start proliferating in forks over the next year or so, which will give additional pressure to upstream the infrastructure.  Nobody would want a permanent fork. <br>

Whoever this was, I'm also in awe of the idea that a short-lived, local git branch in someone's workspace should be implemented exactly the same as the main branch of some project or long-term fork of it. This is the revolutionary aspect of distributed version control: removing stuff instead of adding some new and simplifying version control to its very essence. As you wrote, this is the one truly universal and perfect approach to manage the necessary _duplication_ that has to happen when more than one person works _concurrently_ on any codebase.<br>

Neither McVoy nor Linus worked in a vacuum, but both went in new directions. Bitkeeper isn't a clone of CVS or SVN and git isn't a clone of bk.  <a href="https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116129092117475">Here</a> is an old post by Linus comparing git and bk.

The "lone inventor" thing on McVoy arises out of the internal history of Sun Microsystems having been almost entirely lost (as far as the Internet is concerned).<br>
<p>
BitKeeper drew from TeamWare, a distributed SCM that used SCCS for per-file histories. I don't think McVoy did much work on Teamware itself - certainly, there were a number of others within Sun who worked on its inception and design. Hard to find authoritative sources on the Internet - there were some histories inside Sun, but they're gone/unavailable.<br>

      <p>Having spent some years on the Solaris binary stability team, I see Rust as more suited to evolving[1] code to handle new functionality than C.  And C was better than PL/1 or EPL, although it did take more work to get it right.  

<p>I do find Rust hard, as I'm <i>A Bear of Very Little Brain</i>, but I would have killed for it in Solaris, no matter how much harder it was.

If they came to the Linux kernel hoping not to have to write C then they came to the wrong place. It's just unrealistic to expect to be able to work on Linux without having to know and write C.

It's not the "writing C" that's the problem. It's the "writing *large*amounts* of C" that's the problem.<br>
<p>
And if the aim is to define "a better interface" (which it appears it is), then it should be *everybody's* problem to ease the transition. "I see you're trying to help me. Well, I'm not going to help you do that" - does that seem a reasonable attitude to you?<br>

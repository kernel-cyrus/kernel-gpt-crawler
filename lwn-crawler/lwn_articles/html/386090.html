           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 4, 2010</br>
           </div>
Dan Magenheimer's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/340080/">transcendent
memory patch</a> was examined here last July.  This patch creates a special
class of memory which is not directly accessible to the rest of the kernel,
allowing a number of special tricks to be played.  Since then, transcendent
memory has seemingly disappeared from view - until now, at least.  Dan has
returned with a pair of new abstractions - called "Cleancache" and
"Frontswap" - each of which encapsulates a part of what transcendent memory
does.
<p>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/384411/">Cleancache</a> is the less
controversial of the two.  Dan describes it as 
"<q>a page-granularity victim cache for clean pages<q>", which
should be crystal-clear to most LWN readers.  For those who need a few more
words: Cleancache provides a place where the kernel can put pages which it
can afford to lose, but which it would like to keep around if possible.  A
classic example is file-backed pages which are clean, so they can be
recovered from disk if need be.  The kernel can drop such pages with no
data loss, but things will get slower if the page is needed in the near
future and must be read back from disk.
<p>
In such situations, the kernel could, instead of dropping the page, put it into the
Cleancache system with:
<p>
<pre>
    int cleancache_put_page(struct page *page);
</pre>
<p>
At some future point, if there is a need for the page, it can be retrieved
with:
<p>
<pre>
    int cleancache_get_page(struct page *page);
</pre>
<p>
The key point is that there is never any guarantee that
<tt>cleancache_get_page()</tt> will actually succeed in getting the page
back.  The Cleancache code (or whatever mechanism sits behind it) is free
to drop the page at any time if it needs the memory for some other
purpose.  So Cleancache users must be prepared to fall back to the real
backing store if <tt>cleancache_get_page()</tt> fails.
<p>
While Cleancache holds the page, it can do creative things with it.  Pages
with duplicate contents are not uncommon, especially in virtualized
situations; often, significant numbers of pages contain only zeroes.  The
backing store behind Cleancache can detect those duplicates and store a
single copy.  Compression of stored pages is also possible; there is
currently work afoot to implement ramzswap (<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/334649/">CompCache</a>) as a Cleancache
backend.  It might also be possible to use Cleancache as part of a
solid-state cache in front of a normal rotating drive.
<p>
Dan's patches include the addition of hooks to commonly-used filesystems so
that they will use Cleancache automatically.
<p>
The other half of the equation is <a
href="/Articles/386103/">Frontswap</a>; unlike Cleancache, Frontswap is
meant to deal with dirty pages that the kernel would like to get rid of.
Once again, there is an interface for moving pages into and out of the
system:
<p>
<pre>
    int frontswap_put_page(struct page *page);
    int frontswap_get_page(struct page *page);
</pre>
<p>
The rules are a bit different, though: Frontswap is not required to accept
pages handed to it (so <tt>frontswap_put_page()</tt> can fail), but every
page it accepts is guaranteed to be there later when the kernel asks to get
it back.
<p>
Like Cleancache, Frontswap can play tricks with the stored pages to stretch its
memory resources.  The real purpose behind this mechanism, though, appears
to be to enable a hypervisor to respond quickly to memory usage spikes in
virtualized guests.  Dan <a href="/Articles/386104/">put it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Frontswap serves nicely as an emergency safety valve when a guest
	has given up (too) much of its memory via ballooning but
	unexpectedly has an urgent need that can't be serviced quickly
	enough by the balloon driver.
</div>
<p>
Reviewers have been more skeptical of this mechanism.  To some, it looks
like a way for dealing with shortcomings in the balloon driver, which is
already charged with implementing hypervisor decisions on how much memory
is to be made available to guests.  If that is the case, it seems like
fixing the balloon driver might be the better approach.
Dan's response is that balloon drivers cannot respond quickly to memory
needs, and that regulating guest memory with a balloon driver can lead to
swap storms.  This is, apparently, a real problem encountered by
virtualized systems in the field.  
If, instead, the hypervisor maintains a pool of pages for Frontswap, it
can make them available quickly when the need arises, mitigating
memory-related performance problems.
<p>
Beyond that, Avi Kivity <a href="/Articles/386109/">complains</a> that
memory given to guests with Frontswap can never be recovered by the
hypervisor if those guests choose to hang onto it.  Since operating systems
tend to be written to take advantage of all of the memory resources
available to them, it seems possible that Frontswap memory could fill
quickly and would stay full, leaving the hypervisor starving for memory
while maintaining pages it cannot get rid of.  Avi also dislikes the
page-at-a-time, synchronous nature of the Frontswap API.  Dan's response
here is that per-guest quotas will keep any guest from using too much
Frontswap space and that the API is better suited to the problem being
solved.
<p>
Complaints notwithstanding, Cleancache and Frontswap already appear to be
in reasonably wide use; they are shipping in OpenSUSE 11.2, Oracle's VM
virtualization product, and with Xen.  Such distribution certainly
stretches the "upstream first" rule somewhat, but it also shows that there
is apparently a real use case for these features.  Given that the patches
are not particularly intrusive and that the features have no cost if they
are not used, it seems that something along these lines should make it into
the mainline sooner or later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Find some serious-looking problems with a new feature and then discover some distros have charged ahead and added it anyway. Worse, some user-space stuff which could suffer from it already requires it. I love the Linux world sometimes.<br>

           </div>
<p>The last <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/410200/">LWN article on
Ftrace</a> described <tt>trace-cmd</tt>, which is a front end tool to
interface with Ftrace. <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is all command line based, and
works well for embedded devices or tracing on a remote system. But reading
the output in a text format may be a bit overwhelming, and make it hard to
see the bigger picture. To be able to understand how
processes interact, a GUI can help humans see what is happening at a global
scale.  KernelShark has been written to fulfill this requirement. It is a
GUI front end to <tt>trace-cmd</tt>.  </p>

<p>
KernelShark is distributed in the same repository that <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is:

<pre>
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/trace-cmd.git
</pre>

To build it, you just need to type <tt>make&nbsp;gui</tt>, as just typing
<tt>make</tt> 
will only build <tt>trace-cmd</tt>. These two tools have been kept separate
since a lot 
of embedded devices do not have the libraries needed to build KernelShark.
A <a href="http://rostedt.homelinux.com/kernelshark/">full HTML help</a>
is included in the repository and is installed with <tt>make install_doc</tt>. After installing
the documentation, you can access the help directly from KernelShark from the
"Help" menu.
</p>

<p>
This article is not a tutorial on using KernelShark, as everything you need to
know about the tool is kept up-to-date in the KernelShark
repository. Instead, this 
article will describe a use case that KernelShark was instrumental in helping
to solve.
</p>

<h4>Analyzing the real-time scheduler</h4>

<p> Some time ago, when the push/pull algorithm of the real-time scheduler
in Linux was being developed, a decision had to be made about what to do
when a high priority process wakes up on a CPU running a lower real-time
priority process, where both processes have multiple CPU affinity, and both
can be migrated to a CPU running a non-real-time task. One would think that
the proper thing to do would be to simply wake up the high priority process
on that CPU which would cause the lower priority process to be pushed off
the running CPU. But a theory was that by doing so, we move a cache hot
real-time process onto a cache cold CPU and possibly replace it with a
cache cold process. 

<p>
After some debate, the decision was made to migrate the
high priority process to the CPU running the lowest priority task (or no
task at all) and wake it there. Some time later, after the code was
incorporated into mainline, I started to question this decision even though
I was the one that fought for it. With the introduction of Ftrace, we now
have a utility to truly examine the impact that decision has made.  </p>

<p>
The decision to move the higher priority task was based on an assumption
that if the task was waking up, that it is more likely to be cache cold
than a task that is already running. Thinking more about this case, one
must think about what would cause a high priority task to wake up in the first place.
If it is woken up periodically to do some work, then it can very well be
the case that it will be cache cold. Any task that was scheduled
in between can easily push out the cache of this high priority task.
But what if the high priority task was blocked on a mutex? If the
task was blocked on a mutex and another RT task was scheduled in its place
then when the high priority task wakes up again, there is a good chance that
the task will be cache hot. 

<p> A mutex in most real-time programs will usually be held for a short
period of time. The PREEMPT_RT patch, which this code was developed from,
converts spinlocks into mutexes, and those mutexes are held for very small
code segments, as all spinlocks should be. Migrating a task simply because
it blocked on a mutex increases the impact these locks have on the
throughput. Why punish the high priority task even more because it blocked
and had to wait for another task to run? 

<p>
Before making any decision to change the code,  I needed to have a test
case that can show that the moving of a high priority task instead of preempting
the lower priority task will cause the high priority task to ping pong around
the CPUs when there is lock contention. A high priority task should not be
punished (migrated) if it simply encounters lock contention with lower priority real-time
tasks. It would also be helpful to know how changing this decision affects the total
number of migrations for all the tasks under lock contention.

<h4>First try</h4>

<p>
Having a 4 processor box to play with,
I started writing a test case that would possibly cause this scenario, and
use Ftrace to analyze the result. The first test case to try was to
create five threads (one more than CPUs) and four pthread mutex locks.
Have all threads wake up from a barrier wait and then loop 50 times
grabbing each lock in sequence and do a small busy loop. The name of this
test is called <a href="/Articles/425760/">migrate.c</a>.
</p>

<p>
The test application uses <tt>trace_marker</tt> as explained in
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366796/">previous articles</a> to write what is happening
inside the application to synchronize with kernel tracing.
</p>

<p>
Running the following with <tt>trace-cmd</tt>:

<pre>
   # trace-cmd record -e 'sched_wakeup*' -e sched_switch -e 'sched_migrate*' migrate
   # kernelshark
</pre>

<a href="/Articles/425772/">

border=0 alt="[KernelShark]" align="left">
</a>

Like <tt>trace-cmd report</tt>, KernelShark will, by default, read
the file <tt>trace.dat</tt>. You can specify another file by naming it as
the first argument to KernelShark. While the KernelShark display images may be
difficult to read fully in the article, clicking any of them will bring
up a full-resolution version.
</p>

<p>
Since all tasks have been recorded, even <tt>trace-cmd</tt> itself, we want to
filter out any tasks that we do not care about.
Selecting <tt>Filter->Tasks</tt> from the KernelShark menu, and then
choosing only the <tt>migrate</tt> threads will remove the extraneous
tasks.
Note that events that involve two tasks, like <tt>sched_switch</tt>
or <tt>sched_wakeup</tt>, will not be filtered out if one of the tasks
should be displayed.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/425773/">

border=0 alt="[KernelShark post-filtering]" align="right">
</a>

<p>
In the default graph view, each on-line CPU is represented by a plot line.
Each task is represented by a different color. The color is determined by running the
process ID through a hash function and then parsing that number into a
RGB format.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The purple (<span style="background: #c80ff7;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) colored bar represents
<tt>thread&nbsp;4</tt>, the highest priority task.
<li>The orange(ish) (<span style="background:
#fd523e;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) colored bar represents <tt>thread&nbsp;3</tt>.
<li>The turquoise (<span style="background:
#0b9db5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) colored bar represents <tt>thread&nbsp;2</tt>.
<li>The brown (<span style="background:
#570823;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) colored bar represents <tt>thread&nbsp;1</tt>.
<li>The light blue (<span style="background:
#e4f3e8;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) colored bar represents <tt>thread&nbsp;0</tt>,
the lowest priority task.
</ul>

<p>
The lines sticking out of the top of the bars represent
events that appear in the list below the graph.
</p>

<p>
By examining the graph we can see that the test case was quite naive.
The lowest priority task, thread&nbsp;0, never got to run until the other
four tasks were finished. This makes sense as the machine only had four
CPUs and there were four higher priority tasks running. The four running
tasks were running in lock step, taking the locks in sequence. From this
view it looks like the tasks went out of sequence, but if we zoom in to
where the migrations happened, we see something different.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/425774/">

border=0 alt="[KernelShark zoom]" align="left">
</a>

<p>
To zoom into the graph, press and hold the left mouse button. A line will appear, then
drag the mouse to the right. As the mouse moves off the line, another line will
appear that follows the mouse. When you let go of the mouse button, the view will
zoom in making the locations of the two lines the width of the new window.
</p>

<p>
Repeating the above procedure, we can get down to the details of the
migration of thread&nbsp;3.
Double clicking on the graph brings the list view to the event that was
clicked on. A green line appears at the location of that was clicked.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/425775/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/ks-fail1-select-event-sm.png" width=250 height=135 hspace=3 vspace=3
border=0 alt="[KernelShark event selection]" align="right">
</a>

<p>
On CPU&nbsp;0, thread&nbsp;3 was preempted by the <tt>watchdog/0</tt> kernel thread.
Because we filtered out all threads but the migration test tasks, we see a
small blank on the CPU&nbsp;0 line. This would have been filled in with a colored
bar representing the <tt>watchdog/0</tt> thread if the filters were not enabled.
The <tt>watchdog/0</tt> thread runs at priority 99, which we can see
from the <tt>sched_switch</tt> event as the priority of the tasks is between
the two colons. The priority shown is represented by the kernel's view
of priority, which is inverse to what user-space uses (user space priority 99 is
kernel priority zero).
</p>

<p>
When the <tt>watchdog/0</tt> thread preempted thread&nbsp;3, the push/pull algorithm
of the scheduler pushed it off to CPU&nbsp;3, which had the lowest priority running
task. Zooming into the other migrations that happened on the other CPUs, show
that the watchdog kernel thread was responsible for them as well. If it wasn't for the
<tt>watchdog</tt> kernel threads, this test would not have had any migrations.
</p>

<h4>Test two, second failure</h4>

<p> The first test took the naive approach of just setting up four locks
and having the tasks grab them in order. But this just kept the tasks in
sync.  The <a href="/Articles/425762/">next approach</a> is to try to
mix things up a little more. The concern about the real-time scheduler is
how it affects the highest priority task. The next test creates the four
locks again (as there are four CPUs) and five tasks each of increasing
priority. This time, only the highest priority task grabs all the locks in
sequence.  The other four tasks will grab a single lock. Each lock will
have a single task and the highest priority task grabbing that lock. To try
to force contention, pthread barriers are used. For those unfamiliar with
pthread barriers, they are synchronization methods to serialize threads.
A barrier is first initialized with a number and all threads that hit the
barrier will block until that number of threads have hit the barrier,
then all the threads are released.
</p>

<p>
This test case creates two barriers for each lock (<tt>lock_wait</tt> and
<tt>lock_go</tt>) each initialized with the number 2, for the two tasks (the unique low
priority task and the high priority task) that will take the lock.
The low priority task will take the lock and wait on a barrier (<tt>lock_wait</tt>). The
high priority task will hit that barrier before it takes the corresponding lock.
Because the low priority task is already waiting on the barrier, the high
priority task will trigger the barrier to release both tasks because the barrier
has a task limit of two. The high priority task will most likely try to take
the mutex while the low priority task aleady has it. The low priority task will
release the mutex and then wait on the other barrier (<tt>lock_go</tt>) letting the
high priority task take the mutex. 
</p>

<p>
Running this test under <tt>trace-cmd</tt> yields the following from KernelShark
after filtering out all but the <tt>migrate</tt> test tasks.
</p>

<p>
As the colors of the tasks are determined by their process IDs, this run
has the following:

<a href="/Articles/425776/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/ks-fail2-filtered-sm.png" width=250 height=147 hspace=3 vspace=3
border=0 alt="[KernelShark second try]" align="right">
</a>

<ul>
<li>The initial green (<span style="background: #45cd1d;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the main thread that is
setting up all the locks and barriers.
<li> The light purple (<span style="background: #c138ae;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the lowest priority thread&nbsp;0.
<li> The red (<span style="background: #e41926;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the next-higher priority thread&nbsp;1.
<li> The yellow(ish) (<span style="background: #fdc658;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the next-higher priority thread&nbsp;2.
<li> The blue (<span style="background: #2a9fc5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the next-higher priority thread&nbsp;3.
<li> The light turquoise (<span style="background: #6ed8a7;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) bar is the highest priority
thread&nbsp;4.
</ul>

<p>
Looking at the graph it seems that the highest priority thread stayed on the
same CPU, and was not affected by the contention. Considering that the scheduler
is set to migrate a waking real-time task if it is woken on a CPU that is
running 

<a href="/Articles/425777/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/ks-fail2-zoomed-sm.png" width=300 height=232 hspace=3 vspace=3
border=0 alt="[KernelShark zoom view]" align="right">
</a>

another real-time task, regardless of the priorities, one would think the
high priority task would have migrated a bit more. Zooming in on the graph
brings to light a bit more details to what is occurring.
</p>

<p>
What we can see from the graph, and from the list, is that the high priority
thread did have contention on the lock. But because all threads are waiting for
the high priority process to come around to its lock, the other threads are sleeping
when the high priority process wakes up. The high priority process is only contending
with a single thread at a time. Threads&nbsp;0 and&nbsp;2 share CPU&nbsp;2 without issue, while
threads&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;3 each still have a CPU for themselves.
</p>

<h4>The test to force migration</h4>

<p>
The second test was on the right track. It was able to produce a contention
but failed to have the CPUs busy enough to cause the highest priority task
to wake up on a CPU running another real-time task. What is needed is to have
more tasks. The <a href="/Articles/425763/">final test</a> adds twice as many running threads as there are
CPUs.
</p>

<p>
This test goes back to all tasks grabbing
all locks in sequence. To prevent the synchronization that has happened
before, each thread will hold a lock a different amount of time.
The higher the priority of a thread, the shorter time it will hold the lock.
Not only that, but the threads will now sleep after they release a lock.
The higher the priority of a task, the longer it will sleep:

<pre>
   lock_held  = 1 ms * ((nr_threads - thread_id) + 1)
   sleep_time = 1 ms * thread_id
</pre>

The lowest priority thread will never sleep and it will hold the lock for
the longest time. To make things even more interesting, the mutexes have
been given the <tt>PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT</tt> attribute. When a higher priority
thread blocks on a mutex held by a lower priority thread, the lower priority
thread will inherit the priority of the thread it blocks.
</p>

<p>
The test records the number of times each task
voluntarily schedules, the number of times it is preempted, the number
of times it migrates, and the number of times it successfully acquired
all locks. When the test finishes, it gives an output of these for
each thread. The higher the task number the higher the priority of
the thread it represents.

Running this test under <tt>trace-cmd</tt> and viewing it with KernelShark
yields a graph with lots of pretty colors, which means we likely succeeded
in our goal. 
To prove that the highest priority thread did indeed migrate, we can plot
the thread itself.
</p>

<p>
Using the "Plots" menu and choosing "Tasks" brings up the same type of dialog as the task filter that was described earlier.
I selected the highest priority thread (<tt>migrate-2158</tt>), and zoomed
in to get a better view. The colors on a task plot are determined by the CPU number it
was running on. When a task migrates, the colors of the plot changes.

<p>
This test now demonstrates how a high priority task can migrate substantially
when other RT tasks are running on the system. Changes to the real-time
scheduler can now be tested.
The <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=43fa5460fe60dea5c610490a1d263415419c60f6">commit</a>
changes the decision on which thread 
migrates when an real-time task wakes up on a CPU running another
real-time task. The original way was to always move the task that is
waking up if there is a CPU available that is running a task that is
lower in priority than both tasks. Instead, the commit changes this to
just wake up the real-time task on its CPU if it is higher priority
than the real-time task that is currently running.

<p>
The total number of migrations has stayed around the same (several runs
will yield a fluctuation of a few hundred), but the number of migrations for the
highest priority task has dropped substantially, as it will not migrate
simply because it woke up on a CPU running another real-time task. Note,
the reason 
that the highest priority task migrated at all was because it woke up
on a CPU that was running the task that owned the mutex that it was blocked on.
As these are priority inheritance mutexes, the owner would have the same
priority 
as the highest priority process that it is blocking. The wake up will not
preempt 
a real-time task of equal priority. Perhaps that can be the
next change to the real-time scheduler: have the wake up be aware of priority
mutexes.

<p>
The highest priority thread (<tt>migrate-21412</tt>) was woken on
CPU&nbsp;3, which was running thread&nbsp;1 (<tt>migrate-21406</tt>) which is the task
that thread&nbsp;7 originally blocked on. CPU&nbsp;2 happened
to be running thread&nbsp;0 (<tt>migrate-21405</tt>) which was the lowest priority
thread running at the time.
Note that the empty green box that is at the start of the task plot
represents the 
time between when a task was woken and the time it actually was scheduled in.
</p>

<p>
Using KernelShark allowed me to analyze each of my tests to see if
they were doing what I expected them to do. The final test was able to force
a common scenario where a high priority process is woken on a CPU running
another real-time task, and cause the decision to be made, whether to migrate
the waking task or not. This test allowed me to see how the changes to that
decision affected the results.

<p>
This article demonstrates a simple use case for KernelShark, but there are
a lot more features that aren't explained here. To find out more, download
KernelShark and try it out. It is still in beta and is constantly being worked on.
Soon there will be plugins that will allow it to read other file formats and 
even change the way it displays the graph. All the code is available and
under the GPL, so you can add your own features as well (hint hint).

Interesting. Looking at the second table of 8 tasks it's clear there are 4 CPUs. The 4 highest priority threads have much fewer than 1000 migrations -- 150 or less -- while the remaining threads have 1000 or more. The number of non-voluntary pre-emptions is similarly distributed (presumably because those are involved in the push/pull migrations).<br>

      An interesting note:
<p>
Those gaps you see in the <a href="http://lwn.net/images/2011/ks-success.png">last test run</a> are caused by the RT bandwidth kicking in. If I perform the following:
</p>
<pre>
  # echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
</pre>

<p>
Those gaps disappear.

Looks great!<br>
I wish we could more easily put our efforts in common and put the best of pytimechart (great graphical display), and kernelshark (great textual display and filtering capabilities) into the same tool.<br>
<p>
I guess the choice of toolkit and programming language does not help.<br>

I thought gtk and python work well together. There's even python plugins for kernelshark. The filter capability is separated out and would be easy to make into a library that python could read. As the parse-events library is already separate, and I'm working on getting perf to use it too.<br>
<p>
I'm all for reuse of code, and would love to help in any effort to share capabilities between the tools.<br>

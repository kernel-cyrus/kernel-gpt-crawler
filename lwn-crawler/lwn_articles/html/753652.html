<p>
In a combined filesystem and storage session at the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM), Tim Walker asked for help
in designing the interface to some new storage hardware.  He wanted some
feedback on how a <a
href="https://blog.seagate.com/craftsman-ship/multi-actuator-technology-a-new-performance-breakthrough/">multi-actuator
drive</a> should present itself to the system. 
These drives have two (or, eventually, more) sets of read/write heads and
other hardware that can all operate in parallel.

<p>
He noted that
his employer, Seagate, had invested in a few different technologies,
including host-aware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording">shingled magnetic recording</a> (SMR) devices, that did
not pan out.  Instead of repeating those missteps, Seagate wants to get
early feedback before the interfaces are set in stone. He was not
necessarily looking for immediate feedback in the session (though he got
plenty), but wanted to introduce the topic before discussing it on the
mailing lists.  Basically, Seagate would like to ensure that what it does
with these devices works well for its customers, who mostly use Linux.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/753665/">

</a>

<p>
The device is a single-port serial-attached SCSI (SAS) drive, with the I/O
going to two separate actuators that share a cache, he said.  Both
actuators can operate at full speed and seek independently; each is usable
on a subset of the platters in the device.  This is all
based on technology that has already been mastered; it is meant to bring
parallelism to a single drive.  The device would present itself as two
separate <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_unit_number">logical unit
numbers</a> (LUNs) and each of the two actuator channels would map to its
own LUN. 
Potential customers have discouraged Seagate from making the device be a
single LUN and opaquely splitting the data between the actuators behind the
scenes, Walker said.</p>

<p>
One problem Walker foresees is that management commands, in particular
those that affect the LUN as a whole, such as start and stop commands,
could come addressed to either LUN but would affect the entire drive, thus
the other LUN.  Hannes Reinecke said that it would be better to have a
separate LUN that was only for management commands rather than accepting
management commands on the data LUNs.  If not, though, making the
stop commands do what is expected (park the heads if it is just for
one LUN or spin down the drive if it is for both)  would be an alternative.
</p>

<p>
Fred Knight said that storage arrays have been handling this situation for
years. They have hundreds of LUNs and have just figured it out and made it
all work.  He noted that, even though it may not be what customers expect,
most storage arrays will simply ignore stop commands.  The kernel does not
really distinguish between drives and arrays, Martin Petersen said; there
really is no condition where the kernel would want to stop one LUN and not
the other.  Knight said that other operating systems will spin down a LUN
for power-management reasons, but that the standards provide ways to
identify LUNs that are tied together, so there should not be a real problem
here. 
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that a gathering like LSFMM (or the mailing lists) will not
provide the full picture.  Customers may have their own ideas about how to
use this technology; the enterprise kernel developers may be able to guess
what their customers might want to do, but that is only a guess.  For the
cloud, there is an advisory group that will give some input, he said, but
it may be harder to get that for enterprises.  Ric Wheeler said that he
works for an enterprise vendor (Red Hat), which has internal users of disk
drives (Ceph and others) that have opinions and thoughts that the company
would be willing to share.
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of a filesystem developer, all of what is being
discussed is immaterial; the filesystem developers "don't care about any of
this", Dave Chinner said.  The storage folks will figure out how and when
drives spin up and down (and other things of that nature), but the
filesystems will just treat the device as if it were two
entirely separate devices.  Knight pointed out that there are some
different failure modes that could impact filesystems; if the spindle motor
goes, both drives are lost, while a head loss will lead to inaccessible
data, but that may just be handled with RAID-5, for example.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o noted that previously there had been "dumb drives and smart arrays",
but that now we are seeing things that are between the two.  Multi-actuator
drives as envisioned by Seagate are just the first entrant; others will
undoubtedly come along.  It would be nice to standardize some way to
discover the topology (spindles, heads, etc.) for these.  Wheeler added
that information about the cache would also be useful.
</p>

<p>
This device has a shared cache, but devices with split caches might be
good, Reinecke said.  Kent Overstreet worried that there could be
starvation problems if there are different I/O schedulers interacting in the
same cache.  As time wound down, Walker said that the session provided him
with exactly the kind of feedback he was looking for.

I must've been in an MM track at this time ...<br>
<p>
They may want to investigate some cache management techniques used by CPUs. I can't be the only one who sees the parallels between two hyperthreads sharing a CPU cache and two heads sharing a cache.<br>
<p>
In particular, starvation of one head's cache by the other head is something they should be wary of. You probably don't want a strict partitioning, but reserving two of eight ways for each head and letting the other four ways float between the two based on demand might be a reasonable solution (for a hypothetical eight-way cache)<br>

I made one more observation at the end of the session - that all the problems with management, behaviour, etc were all rooted in the shared cache design. If the cache and queues were separated into discrete segments per LUN instead of being shared by all LUNs, it would look and behave exactly like multiple independent spinning drives to the OS and almost all the OS management and behavioural problems would go away. <br>
<p>
Yes, RAID setups would still have to be taught not to assign both actuators in a single failure domain (e.g. spindle or power loss w/ RAID 1 or 5 means double disk failure and unrecoverable data), but otherwise they could be considered completely independent LUNs.<br>

I have a feeling this is an example of OS developers wanting more control and transparency when it comes to storage devices. To put it another way they'd like to see drive firmware "interfering" less and instead let the OS, which knows far more about usage patterns, make as many decisions as possible. OS developers, not being your run of the mill user, are smart enough not to shoot themselves in the foot when you hand them a very powerful gun.<br>

The first use-case that comes to mind: If you have a database, put the redo log on one spindle and the data on the other. The redo log is mostly append-append-append fairly large amounts of data, the data is going to be randomly seeking all over the place. Both benefit from not being disturbed by the other. If the device tried to present this as a single device (e.g. RAID-0 the two spindles, or concatenate), there's no way you could separate them cleanly.<br>
<p>
Another case: Either of the spindles die, but you could still be using the other one just fine. (This can also be done in other ways, but it's easier to manage “this LUN is dead” than “this byte range is dead”, at least with current tools.)<br>

It sounds like this is essentially two separate hard disks glued together and sharing a motor.  The main difference is the on-disk cache being shared between them.  Isn't that analogous to the old SCSI host adaptors that had cache RAM on the interface card itself?  (I remember running Linux on an IBM MCA bus system where the SCSI adaptor had two 30-pin SIMMs giving two megabytes of cache.)  How does or did Linux handle that?<br>
<p>
The cache on the disk itself seems like a pretty small player when compared to the RAM in the system, so I don't see how the effects caused by sharing it between two disks could be significant.<br>

ISTM a key thing is that one should be able to choose r/w heads<br>
to minimize rotational latency, which in turn will depend on how<br>
long it takes for an actuator to settle on a given track/cylinder.<br>
<p>
So if OS drivers want to play in optimizing access patterns for<br>
different applications, ISTM they will need access to the same<br>
sensor data about spindle and actuator states as the disk's<br>
firmware has, and will need a protocol to override the firmware's<br>
model of optimum data streaming to and from different heads<br>
(which may for starters just be to appear as a competitively<br>
fast black box compatible with ordinary drivers).<br>
<p>
So the next problem becomes social engineering, to help<br>
the manufacturer see bigger disk sales and profit in allowing<br>
free/libre driver writers access to the necessary data to do<br>
wild things that a single closed team of firmware writers can<br>
never think of.<br>
 <br>
Presumably some big commercial users of disk data will see<br>
opportunities for optimizing their software, given firmware<br>
SDK info for the disk, whether their game is SQL or<br>
movie editing, or streaming live, or gaming, etc., and will try<br>
to have it for themselves exclusively, for temporary market<br>
advantage, so history will presumably replay itself unless<br>
the disk mfgr mgmt is unusually enlightened (and has the<br>
independence to resist NDA ploys and economic bullying).<br>
<p>
IWG that optimization would have to consider one actuator's activity's<br>
effect on another -- a kind of multi-body physics problem?<br>
<p>
It is interesting to speculate what effect a fixed rotational delay<br>
for read-modify-replace (if separate actuators are positioning<br>
heads in the same cylinders) will do for the inventive.<br>

This is more like having two drives in one enclosure, with a shared motor and cache.  Wouldn't it be more useful to have two completely separate heads which can each read from all the platters?  That would double bandwidth, reduce latency, and both sets of heads would be able to read the same data. <br>

And a lot of that antipathy is ill-informed speculation ...<br>

Raid-5 is a *LOT* safer than a single disk, if managed properly. There are situations where it is appropriate, and situations where it is not. What would YOU use if your priorities were "available disk space" and you only had three spare SATA ports?<br>

Is there physically enough space in a disk drive to have two independent actuators on the same platters? It's been many years since I disassembled a hard disk (mainly to play with the magnets) but I don't remember there being much spare room.<br>
<p>
It sounds like these MADs are for people who care about IOPS (not bandwidth) and capacity and cost (so they can't afford SSDs). I guess having two heads at different locations on the platter would improve latency/IOPS since it takes less time for the requested data to reach the nearest head, vs Seagate's version where you can do more head movements per second than a single-actuator drive but might still have to wait for a full rotation of the platter; but it sounds more difficult and expensive to manufacture, so maybe not worth the tradeoff.<br>

I asked this question to some HDD experts once and got some (friendly) laughter back ;)<br>
<p>
There appear to be all sorts of difficult problems attached to having 2 separate sets of heads working on 1 set of platters. You can be sure that if it could be done easily, we would have had drives with 4 sets of heads already... (Unfortunately, I can't recall the exact reasons anymore)<br>

Well, if both HGAs could access all the data surfaces, then it wouldn't be an innovative breakthrough in performance...<br>
<p>
See the 1994 Conner Chinook [1] drive, or the IBM Hammerhead DASD [2].  Also see various split actuator designs over the years.<br>
<p>
The basic problem is the heads and flex are the expensive parts; and they get doubled.  Bring manufacturing economies of scale into the picture, and it nearly always ends up that buying two commodity drives is less expensive than a single higher performance drive.<br>

Yes.<hr>
<p>
Seems to me allowing the OS to make one of the actuators cover only a relatively narrow range and dedicate that to uncached log-writing might be worth exploring.  Hardwiring the actuator range boundaries looks like premature optimization, there's lots of other ways the OS knows better what needs doing first too, e.g. why not let the OS auto-stripe long sequential reads?

<p>
It's difficult to predict where SMR is going. There are definitely actual users for the technology and I'm sure that HDD firmware will reach a point where SMR will perform similar to PMR drives for most workloads (if they don't already). But it seems that whenever SMR drives come out with a higher density, PMR drives with the same increase are right around the corner.<br>
<p>
Also with the advent of HAMR/MAMR it's anyone's guess what it will do to SMR versus PMR.<br>
<p>
Apart from that, you might want to replace 'spinning metal' with 'spinning glass' since newer disks use glass substrates, IIRC ;)<br>
Still, I don't think spinners are going anywhere yet, they're just moving into high-density low-performance low-cost storage. If you look at the quarterly reports from the HDD companies, the number of petabytes shipped every year is only going up.<br>

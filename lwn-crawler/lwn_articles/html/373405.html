The release of the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/373332/">2.6.33-rc7</a>
prepatch indicates that this development cycle is headed toward a close,
even if Linus thinks that a -rc8 will be necessary.  As has become
traditional, LWN has taken a look at some statistics related to this cycle
and where the code came from.
<p>
As of this writing, 10,500 non-merge commits have found their way into
2.6.33 - fairly normal by recent standards.  These changes added almost
900,000 lines while deleting almost 520,000 others; as a result, the kernel
grew by a mere 380,000 lines this time around.  According to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/373429/">the most recent regression list</a>,
97 regressions have been reported in 2.6.33, of which 20 remain
unresolved.
<p>

Some 1,152 developers contributed code to 2.6.33.  The most active of those
were:

While some of the usual names appear at the top of this list, there are
some newcomers as well.  Ben Hutchings did a lot of work with network
drivers, including the addition of the SolarFlare SFC9000 driver (which has
several co-authors).  Frederic Weisbecker has been active in a number of
areas, adding the hardware breakpoints code, removing the big kernel lock
from the reiserfs filesystem, and working with tracing and the perf tool.
Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo's work is almost all with the perf events subsystem and
the perf tool in particular.  Luis Rodriguez continues to work all over the
wireless driver subsystem, and with the Atheros drivers in particular, and
Masami Hiramatsu's largest contribution is the dynamic probing work.
<p>
In the "lines changed" column, Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz continues to work
in fixing up some wireless drivers in the staging tree, deleting a lot of
code in the process; he also continues his IDE driver work.  Henk de Groot
added the Agere driver for HERMES II chipsets, Jerry Chuang added the
Realtek rtl8192u driver, and Ben Skeggs added much of the Nouveau driver.

<p>
As usual, Red Hat maintains its position at the top of the list, but others
are gaining; we may yet see a day when Red Hat is just one of several major
contributors.  Some readers may be surprised to see Broadcom near the top
of the list, given that this company's reputation for contribution is not
the best.  The truth of the matter is that Broadcom has several developers
contributing to various drivers in the networking and SCSI subsystems; it's
only in the wireless realm that the trouble starts.
<p>
For the fun of it, your editor typed the "changeset percent"
numbers for the last ten releases into a spreadsheet and got this plot:
<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/empl-contr-pct.png" alt="[Contributor
percentages]" width=678 height=333>
<p>
The percentages are surprisingly stable over the course of almost three
years.  The most obviously identifiable trends, perhaps, are the steady
increases in the contributions from Intel and Nokia.
<p>
All told, the process continues to function smoothly.  The occasional
complaint about certain companies not fully participating in the process
notwithstanding, the picture is one of hundreds of companies cooperating to
a high degree to create the Linux kernel despite their fierce competition
elsewhere.  The significant percentage of code coming from developers
working on their own time shows that Linux is not just a corporate
phenomenon, though.  We have built a development community which is able to
incorporate the interests and work of an astonishingly wide variety of
people into a single kernel.

      The "None" figure is people who are known to be working on their own time - they have told us so.  Those we don't know about are the "Unknown" number instead.

      How many are college students? When people think of working on their own time, you can imagine an engineer that is doing one job during the day and hacking on Linux at night.

<p>Even though, I started as that type of work with Linux, today I bet a lot of it is professors using Linux as a learning tool and then those students get hooked on working on the kernel. It's not that they are not paid to do it, it may more likely be that they are not <b>yet</b> paid to do it.

<p>I believe that Frederic Weisbecker falls under this category.

<p>I've personally been in this category and been contacted by Greg, where I 
replied being in the 'enthusiast' group. Yes, I'm a college student, but I 
did all my patches without any outside influence.</p>

<p>How come you want to consider this as 'paid' work?</p>

I don't consider it paid work. I was just saying that the OP was surprised that the "(None)" was still at the top. My point is that I'm not surprised. I would be surprised if most of those in the "(None)" group were not college students.<br>
<p>
I'm actually quite happy to see that number so high, for the same reason I used the word "yet". Because I know with such a large knowledge base coming up, there will be no limit to how far Linux will go. This "(None)" group will soon be in the paid to do Linux group, and hopefully there will be more inspiring new engineers joining that "(None)" group where it will always be at the top.<br>

I'm one in the "(None)" group too, with a one-liner patch to fix a <br>
regression on a driver. Although I've done it as a paid worker, the kernel <br>
is not what I work with. Just come across that bug when trying to understand <br>
why a piece of hardware we use stopped working.<br>
<p>
I don't consider that as paid kernel work, just a one time contribution by <br>
sheer luck.<br>

I'm sure there are lots of people like me in that situation.<br>

<p>
In the <em>graph</em> the large contribution that cannot be attributed to specific company-sponsored efforts is indeed completely discarded, when compared to the <em>list</em>, where the two categories "None" and "Unknown" are at the top of the list (I mentioned lines of code changed). 
<p>
<em><blockquote>(Also see the upstream clarification about what "(None)" means.) </blockquote></em>
<p>
I observed that "number three in the list" is not "top of the list", especially since the article recognizes the "None" contribution as "significant".

      <i>"where the two categories "None" and "Unknown" are at the top of the list"</i><br>
<br>
Out of context, they yes do look to be at the top of the list. Within context, however, the collection referred to as '(none)' is merely <i>above</i> the list, for purpose of completeness if nothing else, as the list that is being discussed is as the title says: "Most active 2.6.33 employers"... as '(none)' isn't an employer, it can't be top of the list of active employers, which means that RedHat is at the top. By definition.<br>
<br>
As with '(unknown)', it's highly unlikely that all the changes under '(unknown)' are from a single employer, so it's unlikely that from that collection there is going to be someone who can top RedHat in the list.<br>
<br>
<i>"I observed that "number three in the list" is not "top of the list""</i><br>
<br>
Nup, you observed that you can be top of one set without being top of all sets :-)

      If what you are thinking is that one should take the "None" and "Unknown" categories out of the list titled "Most active employers", because we are only considering positively identified company contributions to the Linux kernel, then let's skip the step where I recommend basic courses in English, logic and statistics and just conclude that that's the scenario I was pointing out in my original comment.
<p>
If you insist on leaving the academic trail and you want to play word games: see the title of the bloody article. Consider taking those courses. Skip set theory.
<p>
If you were joking -- and I honestly hope you are -- I had a good laugh! Especially the "above the list" was a brilliant trouvaille.

      <p><em>The truth of the matter is that Broadcom has several developers contributing to various drivers in the networking and SCSI subsystems; it's only in the wireless realm that the trouble starts.</em></p>

<p>Not really :( Their MIPS SOC solutions for stbs are completely missing from the main kernel, which is very annoying when you are stuck with 2.6.12 "vendor" kernel and no way to move forward.</p>

Not really. I'm talking about bcm74xx. These are chipsets used in iptv, cable and satellite stbs. The kernel claims to be 2.6.12 but it really is 2.6.12 + patched in kgdb, random mips patches from 2.6.15, jffs patches from "i'dont know where" (it is different that 2.6.12 and 2.6.15), mtd patches, and basically standard crappy vendor code all over the place. Most of the files in different directories are copy and pasted with minor changes (io register definitions, etc).<br>

<p>
The patch to 2.6.12 can be downloaded here:<br>
<a href="http://hdtvbg.com/foss/linux-stb-4.2.patch.gz">http://hdtvbg.com/foss/linux-stb-4.2.patch.gz</a><br>
<p>
The sad part is that all this is accompanied by 40k binary driver that only have couple of ioctl so it doesn't really need to be binary but because of this crap I can't really port their stuff to something more recent.<br>

Heh, funny you should mention it, due to the utter pig-headedness of Atheros I'm now stuck with Linux 2.6.15 with broken ECMP support on the ar7240 MIPS SoC.<br>
<p>
It's absolutely incredible that Atheros and Broadcom feel that it's ok for them to profit from Linux support for their chips, yet they insist on NDAs and refusing to do anything to document their chips. <br>
<p>
Someone with a vicious lawyer ought to educate Atheros about the GPL in a way that reminds them that a lot (most?) of their SoCs are sold to people who like to put Linux on them and proper Linux support only helps them sell more chips.<br>
<p>
What could Atheros or Broadcom possibly hope to gain from keeping their datasheets secret?<br>

I have no problem with Canonical funding and promoting a nice free desktop OS from off-the-shelf free parts other people have developed, rather than directly funding those parts.<br>
<p>
I use Ubuntu on the desktop and CentOS on the server, mostly.  But my economic activity (via my employer and hosting providers) pays real money to RedHat, whereas I never gave a penny to Canonical or the tiny-but-heroic CentOS team.<br>
<p>
Free software is an ecosystem, not a mere labour exchange.<br>

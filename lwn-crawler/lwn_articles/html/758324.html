<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 27, 2018</br>
           </div>
One of the new features merged for the 4.18 kernel is <a
href="/Articles/743714/">a new polling interface</a> using the asynchronous
I/O mechanism.  As part of this work, the internal implementation of how
the various polling-related system calls (<tt>poll()</tt>,
<tt>select()</tt>, and <tt>epoll_wait()</tt>) work was significantly
changed.  The reporting of a significant performance regression has now put
all of that work into doubt, though.  While it could be reverted, the more
likely outcome would appear to be another set of changes to how polling
works in the kernel.
<p>
As a reminder, kernels prior to 4.18 expect filesystems and device drivers
to provide a single <tt>poll()</tt> method in the <tt>file_operations</tt>
structure:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*poll) (struct file *file, struct poll_table_struct *table);
</pre>
<p>
This function's job is twofold: add the wait queue(s) on which
I/O-readiness events may be reported to <tt>table</tt>, and return a
bitmask describing the I/O operations that could be performed immediately
without blocking.  In 4.18, these tasks have been split out into separate
methods:
<p>
<pre>
    struct wait_queue_head *(*get_poll_head)(struct file *file, int mask);
    int (*poll_mask) (struct file *file, int mask);
</pre>
<p>
Now <tt>get_poll_head()</tt> returns a single wait queue on which events
will be reported, while <tt>poll_mask()</tt> indicates the operations that
can be performed immediately.  The old <tt>poll()</tt> interface
remains in the kernel because many drivers have not been converted, but the
long-term intent is to get rid of it.
<p>
On June 22, a problem with this new interface came to light in the form of
<a href="/Articles/758329/">a performance-regression report</a> from the
kernel test robot.  In particular, a test that exercises <tt>poll()</tt>
heavily regressed 
by 8.8%, which is a significant performance hit.  Linus Torvalds was quick
to <a href="/Articles/758330/">put his finger on the problem</a>: the new
polling interface is slowing things down.  In particular, the replacement
of the single invocation of <tt>poll()</tt> with calls to two other methods
added another indirect call to the polling path.
<p>
An additional function call may not seem like that heavy a cost, but
indirect calls (where the address of the function to be called is computed
at run time) are relatively expensive.  The advent of Spectre has made that
situation worse, since indirect calls must use retpolines on affected
processors; that makes them quite a bit more expensive than they were
before.  So the new scheme has made polling significantly more 
expensive and, since polling is a performance-critical operation in many
workloads, that is a real problem.
<p>
Torvalds was unimpressed with the changes in general; he said that he was
"<q>inclined to just revert the whole mess</q>".  Christoph Hellwig
<a href="/Articles/758333/">responded</a> with a quick patch that attempted
to eliminate some of the extra overhead, but that didn't win applause from
anybody.  Some more serious changes were clearly called for.
<p>
The direction of the most likely fix was suggested by Torvalds in that same
message.  The introduction of <tt>get_poll_head()</tt> already limits
drivers to using a single wait queue to signal I/O-related events â€” a
change that is not universally popular, but it is only a problem for a
small number of drivers.  Rather than provide a callback to obtain a
pointer to that queue, Torvalds suggested, that queue pointer could just be
stored in the <tt>file</tt> structure, where it would be immediately
available when needed.
<p>
Hellwig noted that this solution would not work for every case:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	People are doing weird things with their poll heads, so we can't do
	that unconditionally.  We could however offer a waitqueue pointer
	in struct file and most users would be very happy with that.
</div>
<p>
One of those cases turned out to be in the networking code, and in the
ability to perform busy waiting in particular.  Hellwig ended up reworking
some of that code before writing a patch adding a new field:
<p>
<pre>
    struct wait_queue_head  *f_poll_head;
</pre>
<p>
to <tt>struct file</tt> and removing the <tt>get_poll_head()</tt> method
entirely.  The entire set of patches has been posted in <a
href="http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/vfs.git/shortlog/refs/heads/remove-get-poll-head">Hellwig's
Git tree</a>.
<p>
The changes simplify the polling code somewhat, and they should remove the
4.18 performance regression (though no benchmark results confirming that
have been posted yet).  The cost comes in the form of adding another
pointer to <tt>struct file</tt>, of which there can be many instances on a
busy system.  The fixes are also the sort of change that is normally not
seen as desirable after the close of the merge window, and the networking
changes have not yet been approved by the networking developers.
<p>
An argument could thus be made in favor of reverting the polling
changes entirely and trying again in 4.19.  That may be exactly what
happens if the 
networking developers resist the changes in their subsystem.  The more
likely outcome, though, is that these changes will receive whatever
additional fixes prove to be necessary and will be merged in the near
future.  The new polling mechanism brings significant performance
improvements for users who can take advantage of the asynchronous I/O
interface, and they would prefer not to wait for it if possible.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The advantage was to be able to add the AIO polling operation, which needs to do those two things at different times.

I believe that the busy waiting is done for interfaces where new data is expected very quickly and doing a kernel &lt;-&gt; userspace context switch is a waste of time.<br>
<p>
This can happen a lot with things like 100 Gbps Ethernet and NVMe drives.<br>
<p>
With such high speed devices today and so many CPU cores available it makes a lot of sense to busy wait.<br>
<p>
For some of these things developers are looking for good ways to map them into userspace and *never* going into the kernel.<br>

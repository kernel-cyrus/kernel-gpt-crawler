Kumar Gala talked about the use of DMA engines, which are becoming regular
features on current processors.  These engines can perform simple memory
operations, such as zeroing and copying, offloading that work from the host
CPU.  The more advanced engines can perform transformations on data, all
the way up to those which can handle cryptographic operations.  Nobody
argues that these engines should not be supported; the main issue is what
sort of API should be created to access them.
<p>

The initial discussion involved API calls for allocating DMA engine
channels and submitting operations to them.  After some discussion,
however, it was agreed that this was the wrong approach.  Nobody wants to
see the kernel fill up with code which checks for DMA engines, attempts to
allocate channels, and codes around failures.  Far better would be to have
a function which arranges for a copy operation to happen using the best
method available at the moment.  An asynchronous interface, with a callback
to indicate completion, is probably the best way to go, though there are
some issues to work out there.
<p>

James Bottomley talked about a related issue: the management of I/O memory
management units (IOMMUs).  An IOMMU provides a virtual address space to
DMA-capable devices, solving addressing issues and setting up transparent
scatter/gather operations.  Not all architectures have IOMMUs, but that may
be about to change.
<p>
The driving force at this point is virtualization; evidently there is a
great deal of interest in assigning devices to virtualized systems and
letting those systems handle the I/O details.  If you give a DMA-capable
device to a virtualized host, however, you give that host an engine which
is capable of overwriting any device-addressable memory on the system.
That is a violation of the isolation model and a potential security problem
One could solve this problem by not letting virtualized hosts program DMA
operations, but the preferred approach seems to be to restrict those
operations by way of an IOMMU.
<p>
Making that sort of restriction work will require some changes to the
kernel's DMA interface.  The current DMA mapping interface, which is
designed to be lightweight and fast, will have to become a trap into the
hypervisor, which can then police the IOMMU settings.  As a result,
multi-chunk DMA operations will, whenever possible, need to be mapped in a
single operation to avoid causing excessive traps.  That means using
<tt>dma_map_sg()</tt>, rather than mapping each page individually.  The
block layer, says James, works that way now, but the networking code does
not.  That will need to be fixed, perhaps by way of unifying some of the
scatter/gather I/O paths in the kernel.
<p>
Life gets even harder when trying to share devices between virtual machines
- a use case for which there is, apparently, some real demand.  Nobody
really knows how to do that, not even the hardware vendors.  If the Linux
developers would like to have any influence over how this mode of operation
is to be controlled, now is the time to come up with proposals.  James will
(reluctantly) work to bring such a proposal about.

      With regards to the sharing devices between VMs, I don't quite agree that HW vendors don't know how to do it. It has been done with Infiniband devices (e.g., Jiuxing Liu's work at <a href="https://db.usenix.org/events/usenix06/tech/liu.html">https://db.usenix.org/events/usenix06/tech/liu.html</a> and <a href="http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/xen-smartio.hg">http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/xen-smartio.hg</a>) and the PCI SIG IOV (IO Virtualization) group is working on defining and refining how this could be done.<br>
<p>
With regards to IOMMUs being used to dedicate devices to guest domains, Jon Mason gave a talk about our work to do this at OLS yesterday. See <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2006/view_abstract.php?content_key=91">http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2006/view_abstract.php?cont...</a> for the abstract, <a href="http://www.mulix.org/lectures/using-iommus-for-virtualization/using-iommus-for-virtualization.pdf">http://www.mulix.org/lectures/using-iommus-for-virtualiza...</a> for a preliminary copy of the slides, and <a href="http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/xen-iommu.hg">http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/xen-iommu.hg</a> and <a href="http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/linux-iommu.hg">http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/linux-iommu.hg</a> for the current snapshot of the code. The isolation capable IOMMU we're using is Calgary, available on high end IBM Intel and PPC based servers. So far we haven't had to modify the DMA-API interface, but we haven't gotten to optimizing it yet. <br>

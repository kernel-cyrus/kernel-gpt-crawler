           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 28, 2009</br>
           </div>
Most Linux systems divide memory into 4096-byte pages; for the bulk of the
memory management code, that is the smallest unit of memory which can be
manipulated.  4KB is an increase over what early virtual memory systems
used; 512 bytes was once common.  But it is still small relative to the
both the amount of physical memory available on contemporary systems and
the working set size of applications running on those systems.  That means
that the operating system has more pages to manage than it did some years
back.
<p>
Most current processors can work with pages larger than 4KB.  There are
advantages to using larger pages: the size of page tables decreases, as
does the number of page faults required to get an application into RAM.
There is also a significant performance advantage that derives from the
fact that large pages require fewer translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
slots.  These slots are a highly contended resource on most systems;
reducing TLB misses can improve performance considerably for a number of
large-memory workloads.
<p>
There are also disadvantages to using larger pages.  The amount of wasted
memory will increase as a result of internal fragmentation; extra data
dragged around with sparsely-accessed memory can also be costly.  Larger
pages take longer to transfer from secondary storage, increasing page fault
latency (while decreasing page fault counts).  The time required to simply
clear very large pages can create significant kernel latencies.  For all of
these reasons, operating systems have generally stuck to smaller pages.
Besides, having a single, small page size simply works and has the benefit
of many years of experience.

<p>
There are exceptions, though.  The mapping of kernel virtual memory is done
with huge pages.  And, for user space, there is "hugetlbfs," which can be
used to create and use large pages for anonymous data.  Hugetlbfs was added
to satisfy an immediate need felt by large database management systems,
which use large memory arrays.  It is narrowly aimed at a small number of
use cases, and comes with significant limitations: huge pages must be
reserved ahead of time, cannot transparently fall back to smaller pages,
are locked into memory, and must be set up via a special API.  That worked
well as long as the only user was a certain proprietary database manager.
But there is increasing interest in using large pages elsewhere;
virtualization, in particular, seems to be creating a new set of demands
for this feature.
<p>
A host setting up memory ranges for virtualized guests would like to be
able to use large pages for that purpose.  But if large pages are not
available, the system should simply fall back to using lots of smaller
pages.  It should be possible to swap large pages when needed.  And the
virtualized guest should not need to know anything about the use of large
pages by the host.  In other words, it would be nice if the Linux memory
management code handled large pages just like normal pages.  But that is
not how things happen now; hugetlbfs is, for all practical purposes, a
separate, parallel memory management subsystem.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli has posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/358904/">a
transparent hugepage patch</a> which attempts to remedy this situation by
removing the disconnect between large pages and the regular Linux virtual
memory subsystem.  His goals are fairly ambitious: he would like an
application to be able to request large pages with a simple
<tt>madvise()</tt> system call.  If large pages are available, the system
will provide them to the application in response to page faults; if not,
smaller pages will be used.
<p>
Beyond that, the patch makes large pages swappable.  That is not as easy as
it sounds; the swap subsystem is not currently able to deal with memory in
anything other than <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> units.  So swapping out a large page
requires splitting it into its component parts first.  This feature works,
but not everybody agrees that it's worthwhile.  Christoph Lameter <a
href="/Articles/359183/">commented</a> that workloads which are
performance-sensitive go out of their way to avoid swapping anyway, but
that may become less true on a host filling up with virtualized guests.
<p>
A future feature is transparent reassembly of large pages.  If such a page
has been split (or simply could not be allocated in the first place), the
application will have a number of smaller pages scattered in memory.
Should a large page become available, it would be nice if the memory
management code would notice and migrate those small pages into one large
page.  This could, potentially, even happen for applications which have
never requested large pages at all; the kernel would just provide them by
default whenever it seemed to make sense.  That would make large pages
truly transparent and, perhaps, decrease system memory fragmentation at the
same time.
<p>
This is an ambitious patch to the core of the Linux kernel, so it is
perhaps amusing that the chief complaint seems to be that it does not go
far enough.  Modern x86 processors can support a number of page sizes, up
to a massive 1GB.  Andrea's patch is currently aiming for the use of 2MB
pages, though - quite a bit smaller.  The reasoning is simple: 1GB pages
are an unwieldy unit of memory to work with.  No Linux system that has been
running for any period of time will have that much contiguous memory lying
around, and the latency involved with operations like clearing pages would
be severe.  But Andi Kleen <a href="/Articles/359184/">thinks this approach
is short-sighted</a>; today's massive chunk of memory is tomorrow's brief
email.  Andi would rather that the system not be designed around today's
limitations; for the moment, no agreement has been reached on that point.
<p>
In any case, this patch is an early RFC; it's not headed toward the
mainline in the near future.  It's clearly something that Linux needs,
though; making full use of the processor's capabilities requires treating
large pages as first-class memory-management objects.  Eventually we should
all be using large pages - though we may not know it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Tell that to Outlook and its insistence on pasting BMP versions of images around. I am guilty of sending multi-MB messages like this at work, every time I send a screenshot for clarification. The standard solution: paste the images into a Word document and send that instead. Ick.

      I have all the GIMP for Windows and use it for serious work; it works very well. But the 5 second "alt+print screen, ctrl+v" message that doesn't even touch the hard disk, and that contains a bug report or a bug resolution, still takes about 5 MBs. There, my timesaver is your spacecruncher.

Fair enough.  <br>

Mind you, I was comparing launching MS Paint vs. launching MS Word, since you mentioned sending screenshots wrapped in a Word document.  (And I only mentioned GIMP in case you wanted to get fancier than what MS Paint lets you do.)<br>

Hugepages here rely on multiple page size support in hardware to minimize <br>

It is possible to do something similar in software alone, to create larger <br>

      <blockquote>
he would like an application to be able to request large pages with a simple madvise() system call
</blockquote>
<p>
That sounds like an abuse of madvise().  madvise() isn't supposed to instruct the OS on how to provide virtual memory.  It's supposed to advise the OS on how the process will use the memory.  "I will access this range uniformly" would be something that might inspire the OS to use large pages.

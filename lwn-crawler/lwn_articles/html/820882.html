</div>
As Rafael Wysocki conceded at the beginning of a session at the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), the combination of the <a
href="/Articles/743740/">deadline scheduling class</a> with CPU idle states
might seem a little strange.  Deadline scheduling is used in realtime
settings, where introducing latency by idling the CPU tends to be frowned
upon.  But there are reasons to think that these two technologies might
just be made to work together.
<p>
Why would one even bother to try to combine the deadline scheduler and CPU
idle states?  One should never miss opportunities to save energy, he said.
Plus, on some systems, avoiding idle states is not really an option;
without them, the CPU will overheat and thermal throttling will kick in.
Meanwhile, the combination seems viable to him.  In theory, at least, all
of the information needed to select idle states is present; the scheduler
has work estimates and deadlines for all tasks, and it has the idle-state
properties for the CPU.  It's just a matter of using that information
correctly.
<p>
His idea is to maintain a global latency quality-of-service request that
depends on all deadline tasks in the system.  That will show that,
sometimes, there is no room for idle states; if enough deadline tasks have
been admitted to use all of the available CPU time, the CPU clearly cannot
go idle.  But other times there will be some room.  He proposed two rules
to govern transitions into idle states:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The latency limit cannot exceed the difference between the next
     deadline for any task and its runtime.  If a task has 2ms worth of
     work to do by a deadline 5ms from now, nothing can impose a latency
     greater than 3ms.
<li> That limit, when multiplied by the number of deadline tasks, cannot
     exceed the amount of run time available after all deadline run-time
     reservations have been subtracted.  In other words, the system cannot
     lose more CPU time to exit latency than it would have left over if all
     deadline tasks use their full reservation.
</ul>
<p>
Juri Lelli said that the basic idea makes sense.  Daniel Bristot de
Oliveira, instead, said that while the first rule makes sense, the second
is too pessimistic.  Not all wakeups will happen on an idle CPU, so the
exit-latency penalty will not always have to be paid.  With the
<tt>SCHED_FIFO</tt> realtime class, you know about the maximum latency for
any given task, but that is not true for deadline tasks, which have no
latency guarantees.  Some delay for a deadline task at wakeup time is
acceptable as long as it still makes its deadline.

<p>
One complication, Wysocki said, is that the processor may have to go into
the C1 idle state every so often, regardless of what the operating system
would want to have happen.  That led to some discussion about how the
forced C1 time could maybe be modeled; Tommaso Cucinotta suggested that it
could be set up as a special deadline task of its
own, at which point the scheduler's admission control policy could account
for it.  Wysocki thought it was an interesting idea, but he would still like
to address the possibility of opportunistically going idle for additional
time if the workload allows it.
<p>
Lelli pointed out that the scheduler reserves some time for non-realtime
tasks now to be sure that they can run at least a little bit.  Perhaps
something similar could be done to reserve time for the idle thread?
Cucinotta said that this idling would have to happen at the right
time.  Lelli said that it may be necessary to synchronize idle times across
CPUs as well, but Wysocki said he is not thinking about deeper idle states
or idling entire packages at this time.
<p>
Lelli asked if there were patches to look at now; Wysocki said that he
hasn't done any real work yet.  That is a good thing, since he learned
things in this discussion that will influence what he eventually comes up
with.
<p>
At this point Wysocki was finished, but the conversation continued.
Dietmar Eggemann noted that, while admission control for deadline tasks is
done globally, the actual scheduling of deadline tasks is done on a
per-CPU basis.  At which level, he asked, would idle time be taken into
consideration?   Bristot said that this division is an artifact of the
difference between deadline-scheduling theory and the practice of an actual
implementation.  Cucinotta said that it's always possible to partition the
system to move the admission-control decisions downward.
<p>
From there the discussion went deeply into deadline-scheduling theory; see
the recording, once it's available, for the details.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

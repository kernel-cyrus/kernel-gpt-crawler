For the most part, the <a href="/Articles/492125/">logging reliability
patches</a> covered here in April have been quietly stabilizing and appear
to be set for merging for 3.5.  But <tt>printk()</tt> is a heavily-used
function, so there are a lot of people with strong opinions on how it
should work.  Thus the discussion on how <tt>printk()</tt> can be improved
has stretched out for some time.  The result, so far, is a better
understanding of how continuation lines should be handled and, possibly, a
new format for timestamps.
<p>
Messages are sent to the system log with <tt>printk()</tt>, but that
function has an interesting bit of historical behavior: like
<tt>printf()</tt> in user space, <tt>printk()</tt> can be used to send
partial lines to the log.  Multiple <tt>printk()</tt> calls can be used to
produce a single line in the log stream, piece by piece.
The patches for 3.5 make <tt>printk()</tt> much
more record-oriented internally, but the API does not change.  So there is
a bit of an impedance mismatch between a record-oriented logging system and
its stream-oriented API.  That mismatch has been there since the beginning,
but it has become more clear over time.
<p>
The mixed nature of kernel logging leads to a bit of an ambiguity, because
any message can be either of two things: (1)&nbsp;a new message to be logged
or (2)&nbsp;a continuation of a previous log message.
The kernel decides which of the two situations holds by remembering whether
the previous log message ended with a newline or not.  If there was no
trailing newline, a new message will be appended to the previous line.
<p>

This approach works much of the time, but it is not without its hazards.
In particular, there is nothing that guarantees that two successive
<tt>printk()</tt> calls will be executed one right after the other.  Even on a
uniprocessor system, interrupt handlers can emit messages between two
<tt>printk()</tt> calls that are supposed to produce a single line of
output.  Adding more processors to the system clearly makes the situation
worse; there is only one log buffer containing messages from all
processors, so it is easy for one processor to jump into the middle of a
sequence of <tt>printk()</tt> calls being executed on another.  What
happens then is not especially pretty: messages get mashed together and
corrupted.  The result is a log that is harder for humans to read, and
which can totally confuse automated log-processing tools.
<p>
This patch set was supposed to be about increasing logging reliability, so
that sort of message corruption is not welcome.  The original plan devised
by developer Kay Sievers was to require an explicit <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> "log
level" marker for continuations.  In this scheme, every <tt>printk()</tt>
call will generate a new log line unless merging has been explicitly
requested with the <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> "log level."  There is a little
problem in that most
continuation lines are not so-marked in current kernels, leading to lines
being split up; Kay's plan was to audit the kernel and fix all of those
calls to work properly in the new scheme.
<p>
Linus <a href="/Articles/497223/">didn't like that idea</a>, saying that
things work well as they are now; to him, adding all those
<tt>KERN_CONT</tt> markers just represented unnecessary noise.  After some
back-and-forth, Kay came around to Linus's point of view, but he still
wanted to avoid the corruption of messages whenever possible.  The result
was <a href="/Articles/497224/">a new patch</a> that tries to explicitly
remember partial <tt>printk()</tt> calls and associate them with a specific
process.  Lines passed to <tt>printk()</tt> will be merged only if they
both come from the same process and only if the second line is clearly not
the start of a new log message.  The end result is not perfect: if two
processors try 
to output partial lines at the same time, at least one of them will be
split.  But there will be no more joining of unrelated messages, and that
seems like a good thing.
<p>

A different branch of the same discussion got into the formatting of
timestamps, which will always be present in the new scheme.  In current
kernels, that timestamp comes in the form of seconds and microseconds since
the system booted.  But what developers often really want to see is some
combination of the absolute time of an event and the relative time from
previous events.  After some discussion with Sasha Levin, Linus <a
href="/Articles/497225/">requested</a> a format that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    [May12 11:27] foo
    [May12 11:28] bar
    [  +5.077527] zoot
    [ +10.235225] foo
    [  +0.002971] bar
    [May12 11:29] zoot
    [  +0.003081] foo
</pre>
<p>
In other words, events that are relatively far apart in time would be
marked with the absolute time with one-minute precision.  When things
happen more closely in time, the elapsed time between successive events
would be printed instead.  For any driver developer trying to figure out
the relative timing of device-related events, this kind of output format
would help to save a lot of mental arithmetic.
<p>
The patches to produce this format have not yet been posted, so it is
looking likely that we will not see it in the 3.5 kernel.  The rest of the
logging work should be there for 3.5, though, taking Linux one small step
closer to the sort of structured and reliable logging that many users and
developers  would like to see.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

While the format is nice for the relative events, I disagree about the precision of the 'absolute' events: they should also go to millisecond precision: when you want to correlate something which happened in your application with the kernel logs, you need this.<br>

Things that need the raw data should use the /dev/kmsg interface, not the human readable deltas in the text output of /proc/kmsgm, syslog(), or the console.<br>
<p>
The nice thing with the new infrastructure is that all this is only calculated during the output, and not during the recording of the data. So the real data is all available and not affected by any of the timestamp output options which might get added.<br>

this requires that you know ahead of time that you are going to have a problem that you need to analyze.<br>

the vast majority of the time you only find out afterwords, and as a result, you are stuck with whatever data was written to log files (i.e. syslog)<br>

what form or logging do you have on your system that is storing the raw data somewhere?<br>
<p>
by the way, syslog today is about as different from 80's syslog as linux today is from linux in the early 90's. it's backwards compatible so most people don't have to deal with the differences, but there are vast new capabilities<br>

      It is also a shame about the named month abbreviations, in US order. How about a day-of-year:
<code>
    [139 10:58] foo
</code>
or iso-style year-month-day:
<code>
    [20120518 10:58] foo

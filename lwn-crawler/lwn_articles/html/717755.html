<h1>Stream ID status update</h1>

Stream IDs as a way for the host to give storage devices hints about what
kind of data is being written have been <a
href="/Articles/685499/">discussed before</a> at LSFMM.  This year, Andreas
Dilger and Martin Petersen led a combined storage and filesystem session to
update the status of the feature.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Dilger began by noting that the feature looked like it was moving forward
and would make its way into the kernel, but hasn't.  There are multiple use
cases for it, including making it easier for SSDs to decide where to store
data to reduce the amount of copying needed when garbage collecting.  It
would also help developers using <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/blktrace.8.html"><tt>blktrace</tt></a>
to do analysis at the block layer and could help <a
href="http://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> make better decisions about what
to put in flash or on disk. 
</p>

<p>
Embedding a stream ID in block I/O requests would help with those cases and
more, he said.  It would allow all kinds of storage to make better
allocation and scheduling decisions.  But development on it seems to have
gone quiet, so he was hoping to get an update from Petersen (and the others
in the room) on the status of stream IDs.

Petersen said that he ran some benchmarks using stream IDs and "all the
results were great".  But the storage vendors seem to have lost interest.
They are off pursuing deterministic writes, he said.  Deterministic writes are a way to avoid the performance hiccups caused by background tasks (like wear leveling and garbage collection) by writing in the "proper" way.
</p>

<p>
But Jens Axboe thought that that stream IDs should still be worked on.  He
would like to see a small set of stream IDs (two, perhaps) that simply gave
an advisory hint of whether the data is likely to be short-lived or
long-lived.  That would mean there don't need to be a bunch of different
flags that would need to be agreed upon and defined.  He prefers to simply
separate data with different deletion characteristics.

</a>

<p>
Dilger said that filesystems could provide more information that might
help the storage devices make even better decisions on data placement.
Some fairly simple information on writes of metadata versus user data would
help.  Axboe wondered if an API should be exposed so that applications
could tell the kernel what kind of data they were writing, but Dilger
thought that the kernel is able to provide a lot of useful information on
its own.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o asked if it would be helpful to add a 32-bit stream ID to <tt>struct&nbsp;bio</tt>
that <tt>blktrace</tt> would display.  Petersen
said he had been using 16-bit IDs because that's what the devices use, but
more bits would be useful for tracing purposes.  Dilger said that he didn't
want the kernel implementation to be constrained by the hardware; there
will need to be some kind of mapping of the IDs in any case.  The only
semantic that would apply is that writes with the same ID are related to
each other in some fashion.
</p>

<p>
The hint that really matters is short-lived versus not short-lived, Axboe
believes.  So it makes sense to just have a simple two-stream solution.
That will result in 99% of the benefit, he said.  But an attendee said that
only helps for flash devices, not shingled magnetic recording (SMR) devices
and
others.  In addition, Ts'o thought that indicating filesystem journal
writes was helpful.  Petersen agreed that it made a big difference for SMR
devices. 
</p>

<p>
Axboe said that he had a patch set from about a year ago that he will dust
off and post to the list soon.  The discussion whether an API is needed
and, if so, what it should look like, can happen on the mailing list.  Once
the kernel starts setting stream IDs, though, there may be performance
implications that will need to be worked out.  In some devices, the stream
IDs are closely associated with I/O channels on the device, so that may
need to be taken into account.

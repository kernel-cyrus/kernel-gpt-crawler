           </div>
There are now less than 23 years remaining until that fateful day in
January 2038 when signed 32-bit <tt>time_t</tt> values — used to represent time
values in Unix-like systems — run out of bits and overflow.  As that date
approaches, 32-bit systems can be expected to fail in all kinds of
entertaining ways and current LWN readers can look forward to being called
out of retirement in a heroic (and lucrative) effort to stave off the
approaching apocalypse.  Or that would be the case if it weren't for a
group of spoilsport developers who are trying to solve the year-2038
problem now and ruin the whole thing.  The shape of that effort has come a
bit more into focus with the posting by Arnd Bergmann of <a
href="/Articles/643148/">a new 
patch set</a> (later <a href="/Articles/643407/">updated</a>) showing the
expected migration path for time-related system 
calls.
<p>
Current Linux system calls use a number of different data types to
represent times, from the simple <tt>time_t</tt> value through the
<tt>timeval</tt> and <tt>timespec</tt> structures and others.  Each,
though, has one 
thing in common: an integer value counting the number of seconds since the
beginning of 1970 (or from the current time in places where a relative time
value is needed).  On 32-bit systems, that count is a signed 32-bit value;
it clearly needs to gain more bits to function in a world where post-2038
dates need to be represented.
<p>
<h4>Time representations</h4>
<p>
One possibility is to simply create 64-bit versions of these time-related
structures and use them.  But if an incompatible change is to be made, it
might be worthwhile thinking a bit more broadly; to that end, Thomas
Gleixner recently <a href="/Articles/643237/">suggested</a> the creation of
a new set of (Linux-specific) system calls that would use a signed, 64-bit
nanosecond counter instead.  This counter would mirror the <tt>ktime_t</tt>
type (defined in <tt>&lt;include/linux/ktime.h&gt;</tt>) used to represent
times within the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
    union ktime {
	s64	tv64;
    };
    typedef union ktime ktime_t;		/* Kill this */
</pre>
<p>
(Incidentally, the "kill this" comment was <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/f34c506b0385b43abd25c490335036ecbb173aed">added
by Andrew Morton</a> in 2007; nobody has killed it yet.)
<p>
Having user space work with values that mirror those used within the kernel
has a certain appeal; a lot of time-conversion operations could be
eliminated.  But Arnd Bergmann <a href="/Articles/643239/">pointed out</a>
a number of difficulties with this approach, including the fact that it
makes a complicated changeover even more so.  The fatal flaw, though, turns
up in <a href="/Articles/643240/">this survey of time-related system
calls</a> posted by Arnd shortly thereafter: system calls that deal with
file timestamps need to be able to represent times prior to 1970.  They
also need to be able to express a wider range of times than is possible
with a 64-bit <tt>ktime_t</tt>.  So some
variant of <tt>time_t</tt> must be used with them, at least.  (The need to
represent times before 1970 also precludes the use of an unsigned value to
extend the forward range of a 32-bit <tt>time_t</tt> value).
<p>
So universal use of signed nanosecond time values does not appear to be in
the cards, at least not as part of the year-2038 disaster-prevention
effort.  Still, there is room for some simplification.  The current plan is
to use the 64-bit version of <tt>struct timespec</tt> (called,
appropriately, <tt>struct timespec64</tt> in the kernel, though user space
will still see it as simply <tt>struct timespec</tt>) for almost all time values
passed into or out of the kernel.  The various system calls that use the
other (older) time formats can generally be emulated in user space.  So,
for example, a call to <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> (which uses <tt>struct
timeval</tt>) will be turned into a call to <tt>clock_gettime()</tt> before
entry into the kernel.  That reduces the number of system calls for which
compatibility must be handled in kernel space.
<p>
Thus, in the future, a 32-bit system that is prepared to survive 2038 will
use <tt>struct 
timespec64</tt> for all time values exchanged with the kernel.  That just
leaves the minor problem of how to get there with a minimal amount of
application breakage.  The current plan can be seen in Arnd's patch set,
which includes a number of steps to move the kernel closer to a
year-2038-safe mode of operation.
<p>
<h4>Getting to a year-2038-safe system</h4>
<p>
The first of those steps is to prepare to support 32-bit applications
while moving the kernel's internal time-handling code to 64-bit times in all
situations.  The internal kernel work has been <a
href="/Articles/607741/">underway</a> for a while, but the user-space
interfaces still need work, starting with the implementation of a set
of routines that will convert 
between 32-bit and 64-bit values at the system-call boundary.  The good
news is that these routines already exist in the form of the
"compatibility" system calls used by 32-bit applications running on a
64-bit kernel.  In the future, all kernels will be 64-bit when it comes to
time handling, so the compatibility functions are just what is needed
(modulo a few spots where other data types must be converted differently).  So
the patch set causes the compatibility system calls to be built into 32-bit
kernels as well as 64-bit 
kernels.  These compatibility functions are ready for use, but will not be
wired up until the end of the patch series.
<p>
The next step is the conversion of the kernel's native time-handling system
calls to use 64-bit values exclusively.  This process is done in two broad
sub-steps, the first of which is to define a new set of types describing
the format of native time values in user space.  For example, system calls
that currently accept <tt>struct timespec</tt> as a parameter will be
changed to take <tt>struct __kernel_timespec</tt> instead.  By default, the
two structures are (nearly) the same, so the change has no effect on the built
kernel.  If the new <tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_TIME</tt> configuration symbol is
set, though, <tt>struct __kernel_timespec</tt> will look like <tt>struct
timespec64</tt> instead.
<p>
The various <tt>__kernel_</tt> types are used at the system-call boundary,
but not much beyond that point.  Instead, they are immediately converted to
64-bit types on all machines; on 64-bit machines, obviously, there is
little conversion to do.  Once each of the time-related system calls is
converted in this manner, it will use 64-bit time values internally, even
if user space is still dealing in 32-bit time values.  Any time values
returned to user space are converted back to the <tt>__kernel_</tt> form
before the system call returns.  There is still no
change visible to user space, though.
<p>
The final step is to enable the use of 64-bit time values on 32-bit systems
without breaking existing 32-bit binaries.  There are three things that
must all be done together to make that happen:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The <tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_TIME</tt> symbol is set, causing all of the
     <tt>__kernel_</tt> data structures to switch to their 64-bit versions.
<p>
<li> All of the existing time-related system calls are replaced with the
     32-bit compatibility versions.  So, for example, on the ARM
     architecture, <tt>clock_gettime()</tt> is system call number&nbsp;263.
     After this change, applications invoking system call&nbsp;263 will get
     <tt>compat_sys_clock_gettime()</tt> instead.  If the compatibility
     functions have been done correctly, binary applications will not
     notice the change.
<p>
<li> The native 64-bit versions of the system calls are given new system
     call numbers; <tt>clock_gettime()</tt> becomes system call&nbsp;388,
     for example.  Thus, only newly compiled code that is prepared to deal
     with 64-bit time values will see the 64-bit versions of these calls.
</ul>
<p>
And that is about as far as the kernel can take things.  Existing 32-bit
binaries will call the compatibility versions of the time-related system
calls and will continue to work — until 2038 comes around, of course.
<p>
That leaves a fair amount of work to be done in user space, of course.  In
a simplified view of the situation, the C libraries can be changed to use
the 64-bit data structures 
and invoke the new versions of the relevant system calls.  Applications can
then be recompiled against the new library, perhaps with some user-space
fixes required as well; after that, they will no longer participate in the
year 2038 debacle.  In practice, all of the libraries in a system and all
applications may need to be rebuilt together to ensure that they have a
coherent idea of how times are represented.  The GNU C library uses symbol
versioning, so it can be made to work with both time formats simultaneously, but
many other libraries lack that flexibility.  So converting a full
distribution is likely to be an interesting challenge even once the work on
the kernel side is complete.

<p>
<h4>Finishing the job</h4>
<p>
Even on the kernel side, though, there are a few pieces of the puzzle that
have not yet been
addressed.  One significant problem is <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls; of the
thousands of them supported by the kernel, a few deal in <tt>time_t</tt>
values.  They will have to be located and fixed one-by-one, a process that
could take some time.  The ext4 filesystem <a
href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Inode_Timestamps">stores
timestamps as 32-bit <tt>time_t</tt> values</a>, though some variants of
the on-disk format extend those fields to 34 bits.  Ext3 does not support
34-bit timestamps, though, so the solution there is likely to be to drop it
entirely in favor of ext4.  NFSv3 has a similar problem, and may meet a
similar fate; XFS also has <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/1/240">some challenges to deal
with</a>.  The filesystem issues, notably, affect 64-bit systems as well.
There are, undoubtedly,
many other surprises like this lurking in both the kernel and user space,
so the task of making a system ready for 2038 goes well beyond migrating to
64-bit time values in system calls.
Still, fixing the system calls is a start.  
<p>
Once the remaining problems have been addressed, there is a 
final patch that can be applied.  It makes <tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_TIME</tt>
optional, but in a way that leaves the 64-bit paths in place while removing
the 32-bit compatibility system calls.  If this option is turned off, any
binary using the older system calls will fail to run.  This is thus a
useful setting for testing year-2038 conversions or deploying long-lived
systems that must survive past that date.  As Arnd put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is meant mostly as a debugging help for now, to let people
  	build a y2038 safe distro, but at some point in the 2030s, we
  	should remove that option and all the compat handling.
</div>
<p>
Presumably somebody will be paying attention and will remember to carry out
this removal twenty years from now (if they are feeling truly inspired,
they might just kill <tt>ktime_t</tt> while they are at it).  At that
point, they will likely be grateful to 
the developers who put their time into dealing with this problem before it
became an outright emergency.  The rest of us, instead, will just have to find
some other way to fund our retirement.

The trouble with a 64-bit signed nanosecond representation of time is that 30 bits are needed for nanosecond precision, meaning only 2 bits are added to the number of representable seconds. While this does mean quadrupling the current range of ±68 years to ±272 years, designing our clocks to "only" be able to represent times between the years 1698 and 2242 seems a little short-sighted.<br>
<p>
If we doubled the size just one more time, with 64-bit seconds (±10^12 years) and 64-bit sub-second-precision (10^-18s), we could handle all almost any time anyone would wish to theoretically manipulate.<br>
<p>
Transistor density, and therefore memory sizes, have increased by a factor on the order of a million since the early '70s when time_t was first invented. Surely we can afford to more than just double the size of our timestamps?<br>

Well, as was discussed in the email thread, anything that deals with inode time stamps has to use a 64-bit seconds value, and that is good enough for all practical uses. Using sub-nanosecond values for the fractional seconds would add very noticeable overhead with little benefit.<br>
<p>
For interfaces that deal with timeouts (e.g. clock_nanosleep()), or current time (e.g. clock_gettime()), using unsigned 64-bit nanoseconds gives us until 2554, over 500 years before we have to come up with something else. If we can gain a noticeable performance improvement using the nanosecond based interface until then, it should be worth the effort.<br>

That would seem to militate in favor of separate time formats for "point time" (timespec) and "interval time" (u64 ns) - as has occurred in more modern date/time libraries, such as Joda Time.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, at that point "now" could be defined in an offset-ish way - use point time for "when we booted" and interval time for "...and how long has it been since then?"<br>
<p>
But that'd be an even more drastic API change, and thus deeply unlikely.<br>

I'm not so sure there's much of a need to represent intervals close to Planck time within the kernel. Couldn't we compromise on 64 bit seconds and 32 bit subseconds, or would a 12-byte struct be too awkward to work with here?<br>

Well, the 12-byte struct is what everyone's been working with on 64-bit for quite a while now as I understand it - 64-bit seconds, 32-bit nanoseconds (or microseconds, for the struct timeval antiques). On 32-bit it might even be _less_ painful, as on some 32-bit architectures (x86?) u64 has 4-byte alignment IIRC, rather than 8-byte.<br>

Struct timespec is specced in posix to have a time_t value for seconds since the epoch, and a long value for fractional nanoseconds. Both are 64 bits on 64-bit Linux targets.<br>

Oh, ick. 34 bits total of wastage? Sure, struct alignment would mean the same wastage in arrays, but still...<br>
<p>
This is really reinforcing my preference for Rust's [ui]{64,32,16,8} integer types over C's (unsigned) {long long,long,int,short,char} fuzzily-sized ones :/<br>
<p>
(and Rust then has usize, defined as "capable of holding a pointer", for the cases where that's relevant)<br>

They are exactly that - but when POSIX defines things in terms of the fuzzy types, even the sensible people who use stdint can't escape.<br>

(of course, for FFI there's libc::c_int and so on, but that's just it: for FFI.)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; NFSv3 has a similar problem,</font><br>

Similar, but not the same.<br>
NFSv3 time stamps are unsigned, so they reach until 2106, but don't go back before 1970.<br>
<p>
See RFC1813 definition of nfstime3.  Linux server and client get this right (but silently truncate any timestamps out side that range).<br>

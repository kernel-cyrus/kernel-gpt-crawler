It has been nearly one year since <a
href="/ml/netdev/20230710223304.1174642-1-almasrymina@google.com/">the
first version</a> of the device memory TCP patches was posted by Mina
Almasry.  Now on <a
href="/ml/all/20240625195407.1922912-1-almasrymina@google.com">the 14th
revision</a>, this series appears to be stabilizing.  Device memory TCP is
a specialized networking feature requiring a certain amount of setup, but
it could provide a significant performance improvement for some
data-intensive applications.
<p>
The kernel's networking stack is designed to manage data transfer between the
system's memory and a network device.  Much of the time, data will be
copied into a kernel buffer on its way to or from user space; in some
cases, there are zero-copy options that can accelerate the process.  But
even zero-copy operations can be wasteful when the ultimate source or sink
for the data is a peripheral device.  An application that is, for example,
reading data from a remote system and feeding it into a device like a
machine-learning accelerator may never actually look at the data it is
moving.
<p>
Copying data through memory in this way can be expensive, even if the
copies themselves are done with DMA operations and (mostly) do not involve
the CPU.  Memory bandwidth is limited; copying a high-speed data stream
into and out of memory will consume much of that bandwidth, slowing down
the system uselessly.  If that data could be copied directly between the
network device and the device that is using or generating that data, the
operation would run more quickly and without the impact on the performance
of the rest of the system.
<p>
Device memory TCP is intended to enable this sort of device-to-device
transfer when used with suitably capable hardware.  The feature is anything
but transparent — developers must know exactly what they are doing to set
it up and use it — but for some applications the extra effort is likely to
prove worthwhile.  Although some of the changelogs in the series hint at
the ability to perform direct transfers of data in either direction, only
the receive side (reading data from the network into a device buffer) is
implemented in the current patch set.
<p>
The first step is to assemble a direct communication channel between the
network device and the target device using the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/dma-buf.html">dma-buf
mechanism</a>.  The device that is to receive the data must have an API
(usually provided via <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>)
to create the dma-buf, which will be represented by a file descriptor.  A
typical application is likely to create several dma-bufs, so that data
reception and processing can happen in parallel, to set up a data
pipeline.  Almasry's patch set adds a new netlink operation to bind those
dma-bufs to a network interface, thus establishing the connection between
the two devices.
<p>
Some system-configuration work is required as well.  High-performance
network interfaces usually have multiple receive queues; the dma-bufs can
be bound to one or more of those queues.  For the intended data stream to
work correctly, the interface should be configured so that only the traffic
of interest goes to the queue(s) that have the dma-bufs bound to them,
while any other traffic goes to the remaining receive queues.
<p>
The dma-buf binding will make a range of device memory available to the
network interface.  A new memory allocator has been added to
manage that memory and make it available for incoming data when the user
specifies that the data should be written directly to device memory.  To
perform such an operation, the application should call <tt><a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg()</a></tt>
with the <tt>MSG_SOCK_DEVMEM</tt> flag.  An attempt to read data that has
been directed to the special receive queue(s) without that flag will fail
with an EFAULT error.
<p>
If the call succeeds, the data that was read will have been placed
somewhere in device memory where the application may not be able to see it.
To find out what has happened, the application must look at the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cmsg.3.html">control
messages</a> returned by <tt>recvmsg()</tt>.  A <tt>SCM_DEVMEM_DMABUF</tt>
control message indicates that the data was delivered into a dma-buf, and
provides the ID of the specific buffer that was used.  If, for some reason,
it was not possible to copy the data directly into device memory, the
control message will be <tt>SCM_DEVMEM_LINEAR</tt>, and the data will have
been placed in regular memory.
<p>
After the operation completes, the application owns the indicated dma-buf;
it can proceed to inform the device that some new data has landed there.
Once that data has been processed, the dma-buf can be handed back to the
network device with the <tt>SO_DEVMEM_DONTNEED</tt> <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockopt.2.html"><tt>setsockopt()</tt></a>
call.  This should normally be done as quickly as possible, lest the
interface run out of buffers for incoming packets and start dropping them —
an outcome that would defeat the performance goals of this entire exercise.
<p>
<a href="/ml/all/20240613013557.1169171-13-almasrymina@google.com">This
documentation patch</a> in the series gives an overview of how the device
memory TCP interface works.  It also documents a couple of quirks it
introduces due to the fact that any packet data that is written directly to
device memory is unreadable by the kernel.  For example, the kernel cannot
calculate or check any checksums transmitted with the data; that checking
has long been offloaded to network devices anyway, so this should not be a
problem.  Perhaps a more significant limitation is that any sort of packet
filtering that depends on looking at the payload, including filters
implemented in BPF, cannot work with device memory TCP.
<p>
The patch set includes <a
href="/ml/all/20240613013557.1169171-14-almasrymina@google.com">a sample
application</a>, an implementation of <tt>netcat</tt> using dma-bufs from
<a href="/ml/all/20180703075359.30349-1-kraxel@redhat.com/">udmabuf</a>.
The series does not include any implementation for an actual network device;
Almasry maintains <a
href="https://github.com/mina/linux/commits/tcpdevmem-v13/">a
repository</a> containing an implementation for the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/google/gve.html">Google
gve driver</a>.  This work has evolved considerably over the last year, but
it appears to be settling down and might just find its way into the
mainline in the relatively near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 15, 2010</br>
           </div>
It has been well over five years since LWN <a
href="/Articles/127018/">reviewed the second edition</a> of Robert Love's
<i>Linux Kernel Development</i>.  Needless to say, things have changed a
little since the 2.6.10 release covered by that edition.  As it happens,
the third edition has been out for a few months now; your editor has
finally had a chance to read through his copy and put together a review.
In summary, the third edition is a much-needed update, and <i>Linux Kernel
Development</i> remains a valuable resource, but there are some
disappointments to be found as well.
<p>
One has to dig a little bit to figure out which kernel version is covered
by the third edition; according to the preface, the target is 2.6.34.
Robert, ever the optimist, suggests that it will be good for a long time:
"<q>As the Linux kernel matures, there is a greater chance of a snapshot
of the kernel remaining representative long into the future.</q>"  Time
will tell.
<p>
The third edition has been extensively updated, but it retains the same
structure as its predecessors.  The preface talks of "all-new" chapters,
but the number of chapters remains the same.  The scheduler discussion has
been updated to reflect the merging of the completely fair scheduler.  Other
relatively recent kernel changes (mutexes, for example) have been added,

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/linux-kernel-development.jpg" width=150
height=193 alt="[book cover]" border=0 align="right" hspace=3 vspace=3>

and there are changes throughout to reflect what has happened over the last
24 kernel releases.

There <i>is</i> a new chapter on kernel data structures; it contains
the linked list discussion previously found in Appendix&nbsp;A, along with
coverage of FIFOs, red-black trees, and the idr subsystem.  The low-level
device model chapter has been combined with the chapter on loadable
modules, for some reason, but the discussion is not much changed.  The
appendix on the random number generator is gone.
<p>
All told, the coverage of the core kernel is well written and clear, in an
approachable style.  <i>Linux Kernel Development</i> is, at this time,
probably the best reference available for developers wanting to learn how
the kernel works and how the major pieces fit together.  Your editor is
glad to have a copy on hand.
<p>
With that understanding in place, this, too, must be said: the update to
the third edition appears to have been done in a hurry.  As a result, the
book contains a number of errors and inconsistencies, and it fails to cover
no end of interesting things which have happened in the kernel over the
last five years while retaining text which was obsolete even in previous
editions.  Robert has not been hugely present in the kernel development
community in the last few years (he got a job at a company with a
reputation for removing developers from the community) and, unfortunately,
it shows.
<p>
For example, this book (which covers 2.6.34) includes a section on the
anticipatory I/O scheduler - which was removed in 2.6.33.  There is still
talk of the "Linus" scheduler - which (as is noted in the book) was a 2.4
feature.  The mutual exclusion chapter discusses semaphores - which have
been deprecated for mutual exclusion purposes - with the section on mutexes
seemingly bolted on afterward.  
(The book also says elsewhere that we cannot kill a process in an
uninterruptible sleep because it "<q>may hold a semaphore</q>")
There is a lengthy discussion of the old
"bottom half" mechanism which is long gone; the removed-in-2.5 task queue
mechanism also merits a section of its own.  The unlamented
<tt>ksymoops</tt> tool, we are told, "<q>probably came with your
distribution</q>". 
<p>
Some things are simply wrong.  We're told that <tt>do_exit()</tt> calls
<tt>del_timer_sync()</tt>, but that last happened in 2.6.15.  The workqueue
discussion appears to be stuck in a 2.6.10 time warp; <a
href="/Articles/211279/">changes</a> which were 
merged for 2.6.20 are not reflected here.  Kernel stack size is said to be
16K on 64-bit architectures because they usually have 8K pages.  The
version of <tt>struct file</tt> shown on page 279 never existed; it
includes <tt>f_ep_lock</tt> which was renamed (by your editor) to
<tt>f_lock</tt> in 2.6.30.  The "process address space" chapter says,
several times, that all Linux systems have three-level page tables, despite
the fact that the fourth level was added for 2.6.11.  The device model
chapter no longer mentions <tt>struct subsystem</tt>, but it still appears
in the associated diagram.
<p>

And many things which should be discussed in a contemporary book aren't.
Developers working on the kernel now should probably be familiar with
control groups, contemporary debugging tools (kmemleak, lockdep, the fault
injection framework, ...), debugfs, ftrace, git, high-resolution timers, huge
pages, linux-next, multiple slab allocators, namespaces, perf, power
management and quality of service, read-copy-update, readahead, reverse
mapping in the VM subsystem, scheduler domains, <tt>splice()</tt>,
TASK_KILLABLE, threaded interrupt handlers, virtualization, and so on.
No book on the kernel can hope to be complete and still be something that a
person of ordinary strength can physically lift, but these topics are all
important enough that, one would assume, at least some of them would merit
coverage, but none are mentioned in the third edition.
<p>
Keeping up with all that is happening in the kernel is hard - your editor
hopes that readers will trust him to understand this.  So it is not
surprising that some mistakes would slip through when a book is
fast-forwarded from 2.6.10 to 2.6.34.  But the amount of old stuff that
leaked through, combined with the things which should have been mentioned
but weren't, seems a bit high; some of them should, at least, have been
caught in technical review.  As a result, the third edition of <i>Linux
Kernel Development</i> is not as good as it could have been.
<p>
These grumbles notwithstanding, your editor will restate what was said
above: this book remains 
the best overview of contemporary kernel development available today.
Robert is a talented and engaging writer who is able to cover complex
topics in a readily understandable manner.  The third edition merits a
place on the "L1 bookshelf" (the one which can be reached without getting
out of the chair); developers who are working with the kernel will
probably want a copy.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thank you for your kind words on UTLK.<br>
<p>
I could not agree more with our editor:<br>
<p>
"Keeping up with all that is happening in the kernel is hard - your editor hopes that readers will trust him to understand this." <br>
<p>
The Linux kernel is a fast moving target. A new edition of UTLK will likely cost a couple of years of hard, full-time work. Furthermore, the new book edition will likely become obsolete in a couple of years since its appearance.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we should look for alternative, more efficient ways to write kernel documentation. <br>

I didn't know about that.  Looks neat (uses 'as' to great a .o, and 'objdump' to disassemble that).<br>
<p>
I could even hack that to process a command-line-arg which is sometimes easier to provide than stdin.<br>

A better idea would be for a kernel book to be written by more than one person. Robert Love doesn't scale any more than Linus does. The "best" strategy would be for people deeply involved to develop basic knowledge dumps/draft chapters in their area of specialty, with an overarching author (Robert Love, for example) to unify the style, formatting and content to produce a coherent story from the fragments.<br>
<p>
Also, I'd suggest moving from the monolithic book concept to a framework where each chapter is on a rail of some kind and can be slid out and replaced. The book will then never be "out-of-date" and the upgrades can all be sold in such a manner that it makes the publisher just that little bit richer.<br>

Maybe subsystem maintainers can appoint people that would keep the description of one area of the code up-to-date.<br>
I guess some sort of credit system would need to be put in place to motivate people to work on this.<br>
Maybe we can have our own peer reviewed scientific Linux documentation Journal, so that people from the academia could do Linux documentation and have it count as a publication.<br>

When I want some background on the kernel, then I go to Jon's book(s) or one of his lwn write-ups on some new feature. I have been on the look-out for good Linux/Unix user space and system programming books. There is a lot of old trash out there but the same Robert Love wrote the excellent "Linux System Programming" a few years back. I would like to bring your attention to "The Linux Programming Interface" by Michael Kerrisk. Hard cover and over 1500 pages this is not one to drop on your foot. Only a month old, circa lk 2.6.35 and proof read by the likes of Christoph Hellwig amongst many others. Given the increasing tendency of technical books to contain the wrong English word (e.g. two instead of too), typos and deeply flawed example code; Kerrisk's book seems to be a return to old values. Jon, do you have time to review a 1500 page book?<br>

      No affiliate link, alas.  The state legislature here in Colorado engaged in some high-handed tactics in an attempt to collect sales taxes from Amazon.  Amazon brought out its own high-handed tactics - and abruptly closed every affiliate account in the state.  I can only say I'm glad we didn't depend on that income stream for anything.
<p>
Yes, there are easy ways to get up a mailing address in another state and get back into things, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble.
<p>
Thanks for the thought, though!

I bought the book when it became available as I also have the previous edition. I don't mind if it covers some concepts which are not anymore in 2.6.34 as in the embedded world an older kernel is still of use and in use. Of course it would be better if was stated when a concept is not available anymore.<br>
<p>
It's probably one of the last physical technical books I bought, bringing over 10 books to the customer site is too much (I leave them in the car but still). This book is one of the three books I have on my desk though.<br>

I really enjoyed the 2nd edition of this, but it sounds like the best bet is to wait for an updated print or 4rd edition should one be produced. The amount of errors sound like it would make the book far less like to fill the role the previous version did. <br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 14, 2009</br>
           </div>
The <tt>inline</tt> keyword provided by GCC has always been a bit of a
dangerous temptation for kernel programmers.  In many cases, making a
function inline can help performance.  In some, it is mandatory; this is
especially true for functions which encapsulate specific CPU instructions.
But, in other cases, inlining becomes a classic example of premature
optimization; at best, it does not help, while, at worst, it can
significantly bloat the size of the kernel and harm performance.  Since
performance matters to kernel developers, the proper way of inlining
functions has often been a topic of discussion.  The most recent debate on
the subject has made it clear, though, that there is still no real
consensus on the issue.
<p>

The discussion began as an offshoot of the spinning mutex topic when Linus
<a href="/Articles/314851/">noticed</a> that a posted kernel oops listing
showed that the <tt>__cmpxchg()</tt> function had <i>not</i> been inlined.
This function provides access to the x86 <tt>cmpxchg*</tt> instructions; it
should expand to a single instruction.  Clearly it makes sense to inline a
single-instruction function, but, for whatever reason, GCC had decided not
to do that.
<p>
Linus quickly concluded that the fault lies with the (non-default)
<tt>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</tt> configuration option.  This option, when
selected, makes <tt>inline</tt> into a suggestion which GCC is free to
ignore.  At that point, GCC makes its own decisions, based on a set of
built-in heuristics.  In this case, it decided that <tt>__cmpxchg()</tt>
was too complex to inline, so it made it into a separate function.  Linus,
in disgust, asked Ingo Molnar to remove <tt>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</tt>
and force the compiler to honor the <tt>inline</tt> keyword.
<p>
Some other developers agreed with this request - but not all.  GCC will
still certainly make mistakes, but there is also a growing feeling that,
with more recent versions of the compiler, GCC is able to make good
decisions most of the time.  If GCC is also given the power to inline
functions which have not been explicitly marked by the developer, the
results can be even better.  There are hazards, though, to giving GCC an
overly free hand: excessive inlining can create stack usage problems and
make debugging harder.  But these are problems that some developers are
willing to accept if the benefits are strong enough.

<p>
Ingo ran <a href="/Articles/314852/">a long series of tests</a> to see what
happens when GCC is given free rein over the inlining of functions.  His
results were fairly clear: recent GCC, when allowed to make its own
inlining decisions, produces a kernel that is 1-7% smaller than the kernel
which results from strictly following <tt>inline</tt> declarations.  From
that data, Ingo <a href="/Articles/314855/">concludes</a> that the best
solution is to use the inlining features built into the compiler:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Today we have in excess of thirty thousand 'inline' keyword uses in
	the kernel, and in excess of one hundred thousand kernel
	functions. We had a decade of hundreds of inline-tuning patches
	that flipped inline attributes on and off, with the goal of doing
	that job better than the compiler.
<p>
	Still a sucky compiler who was never faced with this level of
	inlining complexity before (up to a few short months ago when we
	released the first kernel with non-CONFIG_BROKEN-marked
	CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING feature in it) manages to do a better job
	at judging inlining than a decade of human optimizations managed to
	do. (If you accept that 1% - 3% - 7.5% code size reduction in
	important areas of the kernel is an improvement.)
</div>
<p>
Linus, however, <a href="/Articles/314856/">is unimpressed</a>.  In his
point of view, the kernel size reduction provided by automated inlining
does not outweigh the drawbacks:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It's not about size - or necessarily even performance - at
	all. It's about abstraction, and a way of writing code.
<p>
	And the thing is, as long as gcc does what we ask, we can notice
	when _we_ did something wrong. We can say "ok, we should just
	remove the inline" etc. But when gcc then essentially flips a coin,
	and inlines things we don't want to, it dilutes the whole value of
	inlining - because now gcc does things that actually does hurt us.
<p>
	We get oopses that have a nice symbolic back-trace, and it reports
	an error IN TOTALLY THE WRONG FUNCTION, because gcc "helpfully"
	inlined things to the point that only an expert can realize "oh,
	the bug was actually five hundred lines up, in that other function
	that was just called once, so gcc inlined it even though it is
	huge".
<p>
	See? THIS is the problem with gcc heuristics. It's not about
	quality of code, it's about RELIABILITY of code.
<p>
	The reason people use C for system programming is because the
	language is a reasonably portable way to get the expected end
	results WITHOUT the compiler making a lot of semantic changes
	behind your back.
</div>
<p>
Linus would rather that the <tt>inline</tt> keyword be considered mandatory
by the compiler.  Then, if there are too many inline functions in the
kernel (and 30,000 of them does seem like a fairly high number), the
unnecessary <tt>inline</tt> keywords should be removed.  There was some
talk of adding some sort of <tt>inline_hint</tt> keyword for cases where
inlining is just a suggestion, but there is not much enthusiasm for that
approach.
<p>
The problem with the all-manual approach - even assuming that it can yield
the best results - was perhaps <a href="/Articles/314857/">best
expressed</a> by Ingo:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	In this cycle alone, in the past ~2 weeks we added another 1300 inlines
   	to the kernel. Do we really want periodic postings of:
<p>
      [PATCH 0/135] inline removal cleanups
<p>
   ... in the next 10 years? We have about 20% of all functions in the 
   kernel marked with 'inline'. It is a _very_ strong habit. Is it worth 
   fighting against it?
</div>
<p>

Solving excessive use of inline functions by diluting the meaning of the
<tt>inline</tt> keyword may look like a misdirected solution.  But the
alternative would require much more attentive review of kernel patches
before they go into the mainline.  History suggests that getting that level
of review is an uphill battle at best.  History also shows that compilers
tend to be better than programmers at making this kind of decision,
especially when behavior over an entire body of code (as opposed to in a
single function) is considered.  But it may be a while, yet, before the
development community as a whole is willing to put that level of trust into
its tools.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

No, that won't help. Because all the information already exists in the debugging info, but loading all that debugging info (like line numbers) in a running kernel would waste way too much memory. Much more than is saved by aggressive inlining.<br>
<p>
In this particular case it was about static functions with one caller, which in general makes perfect sense to inline, but not for the kernel, because when making a backtrace the kernel only has access to the information loaded in memory at that time.<br>

Why does the debug information have to be in memory at all when the kernel is running?  The symbol resolution in the stack trace is not needed until the report is sent off, so it can be delayed until then.<br>

for the symbol resolution to be done later, someone will have to manually transcribe the oops message (most of the time), when the kernel knows that it's in bad shape you really don't want to have it writing to a disk (it may end up writing over your data)<br>
<p>
Linus' statement about digital cameras being are more useful than crash dumps for kernel debugging is becouse it's easy to take a picture of an oops and send it out, it's much more work (and therefor fewer people bother) to gather the oops in other ways.<br>

Besides the reasons given by dlang, another one is that doing that is only possible if you have the debugging info of the running kernel, which might not always be the case (either for the user or the person receiving a raw oops).<br>
<p>
And finally, it may not be strictly necessary and you could ask people to decipher cryptic messages one way or the other, but debugging the kernel should be as easy as possible. If you want to move the symbol resolution to user space to save kernel memory, you better also move all printk strings to user space as well, as that saves a lot of memory as well.<br>

 Inlining may also depend on the processor you are compiling for, the more available registers there is, the more efficient it is to inline functions.<br>
Do we want ia64_inline and ia32_inline defines?<br>
 Inlining does not only remove call/return costs, but also enable optimisations when arguments are constants, and garanties that some external variable are not modified by the function call - so that there is no need to update the memory before the call, and reload all external variables into registers after the call.<br>
 Because most source have been written and optimised for ia32 (few registers), previous optimisations have not been considered to worth the effort.<br>

      <blockquote><em>Inlining may also depend on the processor you are compiling for, the more available registers there is, the more efficient it is to inline functions.</em></blockquote>

<p>Also, how good the optimizer is.  Even relatively recent versions of GCC seem to have a hard time understanding how, for example, to turn register access functions into single ARM instructions ... unless you hit them over the head with an <em>inline</em> annotation.  I've shrunk drivers' I-space footprint from between ten and twenty percent, in some cases, by simple tricks like that.

<p>Contrariwise, sometimes discrete copies of functions are better.

<p>GCC isn't actually known for good inlining, and something that works well on x86 (or, one particular flavor of x86) will sometimes really hurt other processors.

In addition, as I've been playing with GCC 4.3's --combine and -fwhole-program options lately over various code bases, I've found two things:<br>
<p>
- GCC does an amazing job of poring over a complete 'program' and optimizing it when given the chance. Most programs (for perfectly valid reasons) are broken up into many source files for ease of maintenance, but this removes a large number of optimization opportunities. In the kernel, this means that the only functions that will ever be inlined are those defined in header files, so in a subsystem or driver that consists of 20+ sources files, when 50% of the functions in those files have only one or two call sites, they still don't get inlined.<br>
<p>
- Allowing more aggressive optimization has actually found real bugs in some of the code bases I've been working on, as the compiler has been able to see inside called functions and then report useful things like uninitialized variable usage that it could not do before.<br>

For the Linux kernel, this is especially true in file system code, I believe. At <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/197097/">http://lwn.net/Articles/197097/</A> there is a reference to some work I did a while back on building the kernel with <TT>-fwhole-program --combine</TT>.<P>
I should dig that out again.

Shows up a few compiler bugs too...

<p>
What about the the functions in the same .c file as their callers?  There are plenty of those in the kernel.
<p>
Does -combine totally combine, like #including all the files into a master file, or does it keep them properly modular?  I hate having inline functions in header files because the problems of interference between the header file and the file into which it is #included limits what the inline function can do.  But if -combine solves that problem, I can see having usable source code libraries.

Sorry, I was unclear there: I should have said that the only functions *except those in the same source file*.<br>
<p>
Regarding -combine, essentially what happens is that each source file is run through cpp separately, then the results are concatenated and fed to the compiler. This avoids preprocessor-level conflicts.<br>
<p>
However, keep in mind that -combine alone, while it does provide some benefit, doesn't accomplish most of the desired result. -fwhole-program does that, because when there are multiple source modules, most of the functions will *not* be 'static', as they are cross-module references, and this can interfere with optimization and (especially) inlining. -fwhole-program overrides this, and forces everything to be 'static' scope except those items that are marked with the 'externally_visible' attribute. To gain the most benefits, you need to use both.<br>

      How much of the fuss is due to not having or not using appropriate measurement tools?  It seems to me that there might be a small number of cases (say, 10) where <tt>inline</tt> is required for functional correctness.  In the other 29990 cases, <tt>#define inline /*empty*/</tt> should work, and the justification for an actual <tt>inline</tt> should be a measurement of the increase in speed, or decrease in size.  The measurement should be documented enough so that it can be repeated and verified (say, once per year) as compilers, machines, and usage changes.

I find it strange that there's this "wall" between the kernel developers and the gcc developers.  If <br>
there are problems with gcc's inlining, why don't the kernel developers submit patches to gcc to fix <br>
them (or at least post test cases so the gcc devs can take a look).<br>

At least two reasons:<br>
<p>
- The kernel is special, not at all like most other code, so gcc behaviour that is considered wrong for the kernel is in other cases perfectly fine.<br>
<p>
- The kernel supports all kind of gcc versions, so fixing something in newer versions isn't enough. The problem is worked around one way or the other, reducing the need to change gcc.<br>
<p>
Other reason is that optimising is a very difficult problem, and cases where gcc does the wrong thing are in general not easy to fix, because it needs a lot of restructuring.<br>
<p>
As the posted numbers have shown, gcc almost always does the right thing. Unfortunately, doing it wrong only for a couple functions can be quite bad.<br>

Which seems to be a pretty common reaction of kernel people, too, when people want to ignore what Posix says and what standard usage is, in exchange for "Do (what I think is) The Right Thing (for me)".<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 30, 2010</br>
           </div>
Interrupt handlers run asynchronously in response to signals from the
hardware.  Since they pull the CPU away from whatever it was doing before,
handlers are supposed to be very quick; they should, in most cases, tell
the hardware to be quiet, arrange for any followup work to be done, and get
out of the way.  Historically, the situation has not been so simple,
though, leading to a distinction between "fast" and "slow" handlers in the
earliest days of Linux.  It now seems, though, that this distinction could
disappear as early as 2.6.35.
<p>

The core distinction between fast and slow handlers is this: fast handlers
are run with further interrupts disabled, while slow handlers run with
interrupts enabled.  A slow handler, thus, can be interrupted by another
handler, while a fast handler cannot.  In an ideal world, slow handlers
would not exist; they would all get their work done quickly and not
monopolize the CPU, so there would be no point in interrupting them.  In
the real world, which includes problematic 
hardware, slow processors, and developers of varying ability, slow handlers
have been a fact of life.  The nature of some hardware (old IDE
controllers, for example) makes it hard to avoid doing a lot of work in the
interrupt handler.  Meanwhile, other types of devices must have exceedingly
fast interrupt response to avoid loss of data; a classic example here is a
number of serial ports which are able to buffer exactly one character in
the UART.  The slow IDE work could not be allowed to delay serial
processing; thus, the IDE interrupt handler had to be a slow one.
<p>

Over time, though, the situation has changed.  Hardware has gotten smarter
and better able to handle interrupt response latency.  CPUs have gotten
faster, so even a relatively slow handler can get a lot of work done
quickly.  The needs of the realtime tree (and other latency-sensitive
workloads) have motivated the reworking of the worst interrupt-time
offenders, and improvements in the kernel's deferred work mechanisms have
made it easier to move work out of handlers.   So the need for the
distinction between the two types of interrupt handlers has been fading.
<p>
Simultaneously, problems associated with the fast/slow dichotomy have been
growing.  There is no way to run handlers for interrupts on shared lines
(found on any system with a PCI bus) with interrupts disabled, because any
other handler for a device on the same line can enable interrupts.
Allowing interrupt handlers to interrupt each other leads to worse cache
behavior and unpredictable completion times.  What set off the recent
discussion, though, was 
<a href="/Articles/380937/">this patch</a> from Andi Kleen which
was aimed at addressing another problem: deeply nested interrupt handlers
can overflow the processor's interrupt stack - a situation from which good
things cannot be expected to ensue.
<p>
Andi's solution is to monitor the depth of the interrupt stack within the
core kernel's interrupt-handling code.  Should the stack become more than
half full, the core code will no longer enable interrupts before calling
slow handlers.  In effect, it treats slow handlers as if they were fast
handlers for the duration of the stack-space squeeze.  This patch solved
the problem that was being observed, but it ran into some trouble; in
particular, Thomas Gleixner did not hesitate to make his dislike for the
patch known.  Your editor will try to rephrase the argument in slightly
more polite terms; according to Thomas, the patch implemented a solution
which was unreliable at best, was liable to create significant latencies in
the system, and which ignored the real problem.
<p>
Said real problem, according to Thomas, is the fact that slow handlers
exist at all.  He would like to see a world where all interrupt handlers
are run with interrupts disabled, and where all of those handlers get their
work done quickly.  Any extended interrupt processing should be moved to
threaded handlers.  <a href="/Articles/380940/">In summary</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So what's the point of running a well written (short) interrupt
	handler with interrupts enabled ? Nothing at all. It just makes us
	deal with crap like stacks overflowing for no good reason.
</div>
<p>
Linus initially <a href="/Articles/380942/">squashed the idea</a>, saying
that a world where we only have fast handlers is not really possible:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So Thomas, you're wrong. We can't fix all irq handlers to be really
	quick, and we MUST NOT run them with all other irq's disabled if
	they are not - because that obviates the whole point.
</div>
<p>
It is interesting to note, though, that this position shifted over time.
Linus (and others) expressed a number of concerns about running all
handlers with interrupts disabled:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The handlers for some devices simply have to do a lot of work, and 
     that cannot be easily changed.  Embedded systems, in particular, can
     have fussy hardware and slow processors.
<p>
<li> Some handlers  will not work properly if interrupts are not
     enabled.  In the past, some drivers have done things like waiting for
     a certain amount of time to pass (as reflected in changes to the
     <tt>jiffies</tt> variable).  This dubious practice fails outright if
     interrupts are disabled: the timer interrupt will be blocked, and
     <tt>jiffies</tt> will not advance.
<p>
<li> Some hardware simply has strict latency requirements which cannot wait
     for another interrupt handler to finish its job.
</ul>
<p>
Looking at all these worries, one might well wonder if a system which
disabled interrupts for all handlers would function well at all.  So it is
interesting to note one thing: any system which has the lockdep 
locking checker enabled has been running all handlers that way for some
years now.  Many developers and testers run lockdep-enabled kernels, and
they are available for some of the more adventurous distributions (Rawhide,
for example) as well.  So we have quite a bit of test coverage for this
mode of operation already.
<p>
Another thing that happened over the last few years was the integration of
the dynamic tick code, which disables the clock tick when the system is
idle.  Clock ticks are not turned back on for interrupt handlers.  So any
handler which expects <tt>jiffies</tt> to change while it is running will,
sooner or later, go into a rather undignified infinite loop.  Users tend to
notice that kind of behavior, so most drivers which behave this way have
long since been fixed.
<p>
Finally, the realtime tree developers have spent a great deal of time
tracking down sources of latency; excessive time spent in interrupt
handlers is one of the worst of those.  So drivers which control hardware
of interest have generally been fixed.  The addition of threaded interrupt
handlers has made it easier to fix drivers; most of the code can simply be
pushed into the threaded handler with no other change at all.
<p>
Given all of this, Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/380945/">felt
confident</a> in saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm fairly certain, based on having played with those aspects from
	many angles that disabling irqs in all drivers should work just
	fine today already.
</div>
<p>
After hearing this from a few core developers, and after doing some
research of his own, Linus eventually <a href="/Articles/380946/">stopped
opposing the idea</a> and started talking about how it should be
implemented.  Thomas then posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/380536/">a patch</a> implementing the
change.  With this patch, the <tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> flag (used to indicate
a fast handler) becomes a no-op; it is expected to be removed altogether in
2.6.36.
<p>
There are still some <a href="/Articles/380948/">concerns</a> about the
change, especially with regard to slow hardware on embedded systems.  In
some of these cases, the problem can be solved with threaded interrupt
handlers.  Some developers worry, though, that threaded handlers impose too
much latency on interrupt response.  Improving on that situation is a task
for the future; in the mean time, some interrupt handlers may just have to
enable interrupts internally to get the required behavior.  The preferred
function for this purpose is <tt>local_irq_enable_in_hardirq()</tt>; its
use can already be found in the IDE layer.
<p>
Since all of the technical obstacles have seemingly been overcome, chances
are good that this patch will find its way into the kernel in the 2.6.35

This story and the previous one (finally removing the BKL) are making me happy.  These are potentially serious, scary changes that Linux's development model just skis right over.<br>
<p>
Stable driver interface?  If Linux had one, these changes would be close to impossible.  And, if you're still unconvinced, take a look at what Microsoft's DDK has turned into.<br>

      <p>Yeah, the entire MS business depends on backward compatibility. Check 
Raymond Chen's book 'The Old New Thing' for really fun stories of the great 
lengths MS developers go to maintain such compatibility.

<p>Also Check the mentioned book 'extras' online chapters on the publisher's 
page, where the author  maintains backward compatibility for Win3.1 games in 
his youth days. At the time where hardware protection wasn't used by Windows 
and the code  Windows was trying to be compatible to was doing amazingly 
silly stuff with  the x86 processors and PC architecture nuances (GDT, IDT, 
PIT, etcetera).

      Having the possibility of a kernel stack overflow due to buggy hardware 
sounds scary. Hopefully we will all have handlers running with local 
interrupts disabled in the future! (I guess this might also make the 4K 
kernel stacks experience smoother)

           </div>
The Linux kernel uses a number of hardening techniques to try to protect
itself against compromise; one of those is kernel address-space layout
randomization (KASLR).  But randomization is of little benefit if the
kernel spills the beans on where its code has ended up.  As it happens, the
kernel has been doing exactly that — since 2007, in a behavior that
predates the addition of KASLR.  Some changes are in the
works to close that hole, but it is illustrative of just how hard some
secrets are to keep.
<p>
Exploits of the kernel (as with any other program) often rely on jumping
into specific code in unexpected ways.  Numerous techniques have been
developed to prevent this from happening; control-flow integrity
mechanisms, for example, exist to prevent execution from being diverted
from the intended paths.  Other techniques, though, try to make it
difficult for an attacker to know where to redirect the control flow to,
even if they find a bug that would allow that sort of compromise.  KASLR is
one of those techniques, built on the observation that, if an attacker does
not know where the kernel has been placed in its address space, they cannot
redirect control flow to a known location.
<p>
The idea behind KASLR is simple enough: at boot time, the actual location
for the kernel in memory is chosen randomly.  The offset chosen for each
boot is different, so an attacker does not know, at the outset, where the
kernel lives on any given target machine.  If the kernel takes pains not to
tell the attacker about its location, it creates an added barrier to
successfully exploiting any vulnerability that might exist.
<p>
KASLR was first added to the kernel (for the x86 architecture) during the
3.14 development cycle in 2013.  Randomizing the kernel's layout, though,
has turned out to be the easy part of the job; the harder part is preventing
the kernel from leaking information about its location and making the whole
effort useless.  There was, for example, a lot of kernel code that
would happily encode kernel pointer values in <tt>printk()</tt> calls.
After <a href="/Articles/735589/">a fair amount of work</a>, that problem
was mostly resolved by fixing kernel code to use special formatting
directives for pointers and refusing to output actual pointer values to the
log unless <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.html#kptr-restrict"><tt>kptr_restrict</tt></a>
is set accordingly.  Various other <tt>/proc</tt> and sysfs files were also
redacted as needed.  Over time, learning about the kernel's location on any
given system has become harder; whether it is hard enough to effectively
slow down a capable attacker is still a matter of dispute.
<p>
The problem is that there are a lot of information channels between the
kernel and user space, and any one of them might turn out to be leaking
information that reveals the kernel's location.  Consider, for example, the
relatively obscure sysfs file <tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt>.  This file is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7.5/source/Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-kernel-notes">documented</a>
rather tersely as containing "<q>the binary representation of the running
vmlinux's .notes section</q>".  That section, part of the ELF file
containing the kernel image, contains useful information about the
image itself; any kernel code can add data to this section using the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7.5/source/include/linux/elfnote.h#L4"><tt>ELFNOTE()</tt>
macro</a>.  Anything placed there can be read from
<tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt>, albeit in a binary format that goes rather
against the usual "one value per file" sysfs rule.  
<p>
The most common use for this file is to store a version of the kernel's
version number, but there is at least one other.  Guixiong Wei recently
noticed that this file contained potentially sensitive information,
including the location of the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7.5/source/arch/x86/xen/xen-head.S#L97"><tt>startup_xen</tt></a>
symbol; that information is enough for an attacker to defeat KASLR.  That
is particularly problematic because this file is world-readable, so that
information is made available to an unprivileged attacker.  Wei posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240218073501.54555-1-guixiongwei@gmail.com/">a
patch</a> restricting readability to the root account, closing the hole
somewhat.  As of this writing, that patch has not found its way to the
mainline, though that can be expected to happen in the near future.
<p>
Kees Cook, who got much of the KASLR work into the kernel (built on <a
href="/Articles/444503/">work by others</a> that had been underway for a
while), <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202402180028.6DB512C50@keescook/">confirmed</a> that
the result was a KASLR exposure that had been in place since 2007, long
before KASLR itself was added.  He welcomed the permissions change, but
also asked whether addresses in <tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt> needed boot-time
relocation at all; the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/23ecde01-0e9a-4d2f-8194-294174ca7dbc@suse.com/">answer</a>
from Xen developer Jürgen Groß was that Xen, at least, does not need that
relocation to happen.  In other words, the address that appears in
<tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt> does not need to be adjusted to reflect the
randomized offset chosen at boot time.  So we may see further changes to
this sysfs file in the future, though it is always hard to know that such
changes can be made without breaking some user-space program somewhere.
<p>
As this episode suggests, finding kernel code that leaks addresses to user
space is a bit of a game of whack-a-mole, except in this case one of the
moles has managed to remain standing for 11&nbsp;years after its presence
was made unwelcome.  There is a tool
that is meant to help in the detection of moles in need of whacking called
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/scripts/leaking_addresses.pl"><tt>leaking_addresses.pl</tt></a>;
it looks at the system log and walks through <tt>/proc</tt> and
<tt>/sys</tt> in search of kernel addresses that have escaped to user
space.  It missed <tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt>, though, because it's looking
for addresses expressed as human-readable strings;
<tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt> is a binary file, which is rather less amenable
to the <tt>grep</tt>-like approach used by this tool.  Addresses encoded
into ASCII are relatively easy to recognize; in binary form, instead, they
just look like data.
<p>
Most data, though, does not contain a value corresponding to the address of
a kernel symbol.  To find the exceptions (and catch addresses leaked in
binary form), Cook has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240218173809.work.286-kees@kernel.org/">a patch to
<tt>leaking_addresses.pl</tt></a>.  It can read a file of kernel symbols,
such as <tt>/proc/kallsyms</tt>, and look to see if the the addresses
associated with those symbols appear in a binary file like
<tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt>.  With this change,
<tt>leaking_addresses.pl</tt> would have found this longstanding
kernel-address disclosure; it should help to prevent others from
being introduced in the future as well.
<p>
These changes will keep <tt>/sys/kernel/notes</tt> from wrecking KASLR on
systems going forward.  It seems almost certain that there are other moles
in need of whacking, though.  For most of the kernel's history, developers
had no particular reason to conceal internal addresses; even now,
preserving KASLR is not one of the top concerns for most developers.  KASLR
is a useful defense when combined with other techniques but, in a world
where any developer in an inattentive moment can compromise it, KASLR
cannot stand alone.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

My native language is German, and I always read KASLR as Kassler, in the same manner that one would read SCSI as “scuzzy” rather than “S C S I”; and yes, that makes me think of salted and smoked pork.<br>
<p>
By the way, Kassler is _maybe_ cognate with the English casserole via the French casserole (other explanations Wikipedia gives for “Kassler” are a butcher named Cassel or the city of Kassel) -- I’m mentioning this just in case you need more tasty connotations for KASLR ;-)<br>

Apparently SCSI was originally meant to be pronounced "sexy", and the slightly derogatory "scuzzy" came from someone working on a competing standard:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Boucher: ... the first order of business was to figure out what we were going to call the standard. We were told it can't be SASI, which was really a shame because Shugart Associates System interface, I mean SASI, was such a cute word [pronounced “Sassy”] ... So, basically I felt that we should keep it as close to SASI as we could and there was a lot of discussion. There were all different opinions on the committee. But we came up ultimately with SCSI [“Scuzzy”] because “Small Computer Storage Interface” would help us continue to differentiate from those guys that were trying to build this monster [IPI]</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; </span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; ... So I figured well okay, we can call it “sexy”. I was hoping that it would go from SASI to sexy but when the committee meeting broke at the same time as Dal’s committee, Dal walks in and says, "Okay. So what's happening?" I said, "Well, we've got a name. It’s SCSI." And he said, "Oh scuzzy." I said, "No. No. No. [it is “sexy”]</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; </span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Burniece: So he's the one that pronounced SCSI scuzzy rather than sexy?</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; </span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Boucher: Yes. I think he claims he's not, but he is. He's the one ... and because he wanted in the worst way to kill us. So he laughed when he said, "Oh, so you guys are scuzzy."</span><br>

When I was younger before the internet was pervasive, I remember being really puzzled about these "scuzzy" drives that I had never heard of. I knew of eye-dee-eee and ess-see-ess-eye and couldn't figure out what anyone was talking about. Computers being a relatively niche interest back then I really didn't encounter people talking about them much, it was something I only read about. <br>

<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
After a <a href="/Articles/718734/">session</a> at last year's Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit (LSFMM), Jeff Layton was able to
<a href="/Articles/724307/">make some improvements</a> to block-layer error
handling.  Those changes, which <a href="/Articles/724232/">added</a> a new
<tt>errseq_t</tt> type to hold an error number and sequence number, seemed
to help and were well 
received—except <a href="/Articles/752063/">by the PostgreSQL
developers</a>.  So Layton led a session at the 2018 LSFMM to discuss ways
to improve things further; it would be followed later in the week with a
session by one of the PostgreSQL developers to look at the specifics of the
problem from their perspective.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/752726/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/lsf-layton-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Jeff Layton]" title="Jeff Layton" width=227 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Layton started by noting that Matthew Wilcox had come up with a <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/23/994">patch</a> to restore the
behavior that PostgreSQL relies on, which is to receive I/O errors from
periodic <tt>fsync()</tt> calls made by a checkpointing process. However,
that change still could not 
guarantee that errors would always be reported; if the inode is evicted
from memory, the error stored there will be lost.  The lack of a guarantee
made Layton leery of the patch, but Jan Kara noted that there never was a
guarantee, even under the old behavior prior to <tt>errseq_t</tt>.
</p>

<p>
A writeback error may not actually be reported by <tt>fsync()</tt>,
however; other calls, such as <tt>close()</tt>, could return it. 
There was some discussion about whether getting 
an error return from a <tt>close()</tt> call actually makes sense.  Dave
Chinner said that a write failure that is not noticed until well after the
write has completed (during writeback, for example) could be reported when
the file is closed.

<p>
But Layton mentioned Neil Brown's assertion that
returning errors on close is not reasonable.  For one thing, it is quite
common for applications to ignore the return code from <tt>close()</tt>.  But it is
documented that the <tt>close()</tt> call can return errors, so some
users will be dependent on <i>that</i> behavior, Chinner said.
</p>

<p>
Even with Wilcox's patch, there is still the problem of inodes that get
evicted from memory.  The bug has always been there but, since
error reporting is being scrutinized and fixed, it is worth eliminating that problem.
There was some talk of making the error persistent on 
disk, but Eric Sandeen suggested simply refusing to evict
inodes that have errors associated with them.
That should work well, and remove that lingering problem for PostgreSQL
(and others) unless there is major memory pressure, Layton said.  But
Chinner does not think hanging on to a few extra inodes is going to affect
the out-of-memory handling in any significant way.
</p>

<p>
Layton mentioned that  there is another problem: <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync.2.html"><tt>syncfs()</tt></a>
is "really broken" in its error reporting.  He plans to fix that, probably
by using another <tt>errseq_t</tt> in the superblock, since reporting from
<tt>syncfs()</tt> requires a
separate cursor on the error state. 
</p>

<p>
As the session was wrapping up, Chinner asked about tests for the changes.
Layton said that he had some to add to xfstests, but there is a need to
create some specifically for the PostgreSQL <tt>fsync()</tt> problem.  That
will allow some assurance that the problem has really been solved and that it
doesn't regress down the road.

<p>
The thing about close() is that a lack of an error doesn't tell you anything about the data.  It just tells you that writeback hasn't hit an error *yet*.  I don't see how you can depend on something that is already unreliable.<br>
<p>
NFS (and possibly other similar filesystems) is a bit different as close() always does an internal fsync() first - so a lack of an error there means that all the data is safe.  For other filesystems, we don't need to go out of our way to report an error that cannot be relied upon anyway.<br>

Well yes, and even if writeback has succeeded that doesn't promise you that the hard disk won't spontaneously catch fire and destroy your data tomorrow.  The idea is to report, reliably, any errors that have occurred so far.<br>

<p>
That is exactly the question I ask as an application developer: What does an error on close() mean, and why should I check it?<br>
As I see it, *not* doing fsync(), but then checking close(), only catches errors in an unreliable way.<br>
<p>
As an example:<br>
<p>
Let's assume I do a doomed write(), that will hit a bad block, followed directly by a close().<br>
<p>
Now, after the write(), I get preempted for some time, and when my process runs again, and can submit the close(), it will get the error that occurred while other processes where running. Fine.<br>
<p>
But now, I am on an idle system and will be scheduled immediately once my write() returns. The error has not occurred yet, and I won't see it. Not so fine.<br>
<p>
(Alternatively: The first write() happens shortly before the automatic ext4 filesystem sync, the second shortly after).<br>
<p>
So, if I get an error from close(), something is wrong. But if I don't get the error, exactly the same thing might be wrong, it's just that no one has noticed yet.<br>
<p>
I find it hard, to come up with a scenario where that would be truly useful, but perhaps I am missing something. (Quotas and NFS are obvious candidates; they might add failure classes that close() catches reliably).<br>

uh-oh.<br>
Remember when ext3 had that wonderful "rename causes fsync" semantic, so no body bothered to fsync and when ext4 had more sane semantics people complained?<br>
I wonder how many people don't fsync on NFS because they know close() is enough and are about to find out that it isn't.<br>

<p>
No? The behaviour people were expecting was that doing a write and then a rename would result in those operations happening in order and that you'd either end up with the old file or the new file. People weren't fsyncing because they didn't care *which* file ended up on disk, not because they were expecting rename to cause an implicit fsync.<br>

<p>
Do you think that's really likely?<br>
<p>
Linux knfsd doesn't support write delegations, but I believe that both the client and some popular servers have supported them for a while, and I don't recall seeing such a bug report.<br>
<p>
So, I'm optimistic, but I suppose it's something to keep an eye on.  (Possibly also worth checking that the man pages don't provide any false guarantees here.)<br>

The crucial thing may be that a read() after a successful open()-write()-close() may return old data. <br>
<p>
That may happen where an async writeback error occurs after close() and the inode/mapping get evicted before read().<br>
<p>
That violate POSIX as POSIX requires that a read() that can be proved to occur after a write() has returned will return the new data.  <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  syncfs() is "really broken" in its error reporting. He plans to fix that, probably by using another errseq_t in the superblock, since reporting from syncfs() requires a separate cursor on the error state.</font><br>
I thought sync() always returns success, how does it "really broken"? And what is "separate cursor on the error state"?<br>
Thanks.<br>

sync() is void return. syncfs() returns an int, and so could (in principle) return an error if there is a problem with writeback. syncfs() is not defined by POSIX, so it's not "broken" per-se, but I think it'd probably be more helpful to have it return an error if there was an issue with writeback.<br>

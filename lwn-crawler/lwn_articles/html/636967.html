<p>
A problem that Milosz Tanski has run into throughout his career is part of what
brought him
to the 2015 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit. Some
reads can be satisfied immediately from the page cache, while others
require an expensive I/O.  Distinguishing between the two can lead to more
efficient programs.  He has implemented a new mode for
<tt>read()</tt> that does so, though it requires adding a
new system call.
</p>

<p>
The problem typically occurs in low-level network applications, Tanski said.
Not every application can use <tt>sendfile()</tt>.  For
example, applications using TLS modify the data to encrypt it before
sending it, which means they can't use <tt>sendfile()</tt>.  So they must
do their own copies but, depending on whether the data is in the page
cache, some will be "slow", while others are "fast".
Some programs that want to do 
asynchronous disk I/O often just use <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> and replicate the
page cache concept in user space.  That way they can track the contents of
the cache to determine if an I/O can be satisfied quickly or not.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/636979/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/lsf-tanski-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Milosz Tanski]" title="Milosz Tanski" width=237 height=280>
</a>

<p>
The normal workaround for these problems is to use thread pools for the
I/O, but that pattern 
"kinda sucks".  The 
latency added due to synchronization between the threads is not
insubstantial.  It is also often 
the case that requests that could be satisfied quickly get stuck behind
slower requests. 
</p>

<p>
So, with the help of Christoph Hellwig, he has <a
href="/Articles/612483/">implemented <tt>preadv2()</tt></a>, which is 
like <tt>preadv()</tt> except that there is a new <tt>flags</tt> argument
(which, as was pointed out by several attendees, really <a
href="/Articles/585415/">should have been added</a> with 
<tt>preadv()</tt>).  There is only one flag available in his <a
href="/Articles/636955/">patches</a>: <tt>RWF_NONBLOCK</tt> (which could
also have been called <tt>RWF_NOWAIT</tt>, he said).  That flag will cause
reads to succeed only if the data is already in the page cache, otherwise
it will return <tt>EAGAIN</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Basically, that flag allows reads from the network loop to skip the queue if
the data needed is already available in the page cache.  It essentially
provides a fast path with minimal changes to the user-space application.
He has been using it with an internal application and it works well.
</p>

<p>
His patches drew one major comment, he said, which was about using
functionality like 
that in <a href="/Articles/371538/"><tt>fincore()</tt></a> to get a list of
the pages of a file that are resident in the page cache.  The problem with that
is a race condition where a page that was present at the time
of the check is no longer there when the read is performed, which puts
that read back into the slow lane.
</p>

<p>
He has also tested the patches with Samba, where they reduce the latency
significantly.  For his internal application, which is a large, columnar data
store using the Ceph filesystem, he got 23% lower response times.  The average
response times dropped by 200ms, he said.
</p>

<p>
There have been some objections to adding another system call, Tanski
said.  James Bottomley was not particularly concerned about that, since the
new system call is just adding a flag argument that 
should have been there already.  Hellwig added that it required a new system
call just to get the flag in, which is not an unusual situation in recent times.
</p>

<p>
Hellwig has also implemented <tt>pwritev2()</tt> as part of the patch set
to add a flag argument for 
the <tt>write()</tt> side.  There are no write
flags included in the patch, though some will be added as separate patches
down the road.  There are some potential user-space uses for flags for
writes, including a "high priority" flag and a non-blocking flag that could
be used for logging, Hellwig said.
</p>

<p>
No one in the room seemed opposed to the idea.  It seems likely that the
two new system calls could show up as early as the 4.1 kernel.

Are there plans to support something similar for select ? Namely, have this improved estimation of whether a read will block be used to determine read 'readyness' for select ?<br>

There's currently no plans to support select(), pool(), epoll(). I would say it's also unlikely because I don't think those interfaces make sense for disk IO with a fd that points to a fail.<br>
<p>
It makes sense to have select() work for network sockets, pipes, singnalfd, timerfd... because you're waiting on external progress (somebody to send you data or somebody retrieves data and drains the buffer). The same is not quite true for files. It's unlikely that any progress getting data in the page cache will be made unless you explicility perform it yourself (read(), readahead()). To add to that even doing a lseek() on a file does not trigger any kind of readahead / activity just updates the position pointer.<br>
<p>
io_submit / io_wait for APIs that exist for direct IO are a much better API for files.<br>

The problem here is in multiplexing. It's extremely common to have a loop that reads data from a disk and puts it into a network socket.<br>
<p>
And there's no real way to do it asynchronously in one thread - poll/epoll don't work for disk IO and aio doesn't work for sockets.<br>

      You have two options:
<br/><br/>
1. <i>io_submit()</i>, <i>eventfd()</i>, <i>poll()</i> the eventfd
<br/>
Any requests you submit via <i>io_submit</i> can have an optional notification via eventfd. You have to set that in the <i>struct iocb</i>. The downside is that you're limited to <i>O_DIRECT</i> and it can still block in some cases.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Build yourself a threadpool for handling IO.
<br/>
This is kind of what everybody does today who doesn't do <i>O_DIRECT</i>. It still issues like introducing latency (synchronization, slow requests). This is what this <i>RWF_NONBLOCK</i> addresses it lets you try doing a "fast read" from your network thread, so you can skip the threadpool if the data is there (because of kernel readahead or because it's hot data).

You really have to do it from a separate thread.<br>

That's what everyone does since there's really no way around it. That's why it would be nice to have a unified asynchronous API.<br>
<p>
And really, I don't see disk IO that much different from the network IO. <br>

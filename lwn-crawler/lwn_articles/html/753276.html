<p>
At the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Mimi
Zohar gave a presentation in the
filesystem track on the Linux integrity subsystem.  There is a lot
of talk that the integrity subsystem (usually referred to as "IMA", which
is the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/">integrity
measurement architecture</a>, though there is more to the subsystem) is
complex and 
not documented well, she 
said.  So she wanted to give an overview of the subsystem and then to
discuss some filesystem-related concerns.
</p>

<p>
The goals of the integrity subsystem are to detect files that have been
altered, either accidentally or maliciously, by comparing a measurement of
the current file contents with that of a stored "good" value; it can
then enforce various file integrity policies (e.g. no access or no execution).
IMA is three separate pieces: measurement, which calculates a hash of file
contents; appraisal, which verifies file signatures made using the measured
hashes; and audit, which records hashes and other information in the audit
logs. There is also the extended verification module (EVM), which targets
the measurement and protection of the file metadata, though that is not
included in what she would be presenting.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that IMA does not protect against attacks on
objects in memory, it can only be used to thwart attacks that change
files.  The policies governing IMA behavior for a given system all come
from a single file.  There are two built-in policies, one that uses the
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to sign a list of file hashes that can be
used for attestation to a third party.  The other can verify the entire <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">trusted
computing base</a> (TCB) of the system.  The IMA policy file can itself be
signed and verified, of course.
</p>

<p>
One reason why IMA is seen as complicated and difficult to work
with is because there are so many pieces to it.  One area that needs work
is software distribution with signature verification.  RPM has provisions
for signatures on package files, but there have been three separate
attempts to add signatures to <tt>.deb</tt> files, without success.  Key
management is another area; there needs to be a separation between the keys
that are used before starting the operating system and those that are
trusted after that point.
</p>

<p>
IMA-audit was added in the 3.10 kernel; it can be used to augment existing
security information and event management (SIEM) tools, as FireEye <a
href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/extending_linux_exec.html">described
in 2016</a>.   There is a problem, though:  it is important to be able to
identify the namespace or container that is generating the log entry.
There is a <a href="/Articles/750313/">proposal</a> for a kind of
container ID to be used by the audit subsystem, but nothing has been merged
as yet.
</p>

<p>
Most of the needed hooks to measure files and verify signatures are
available.  One missing piece is the ability to verify the signature on the
root filesystem, which requires a <tt>cpio</tt> that can handle security
extended 
attributes (xattrs) on files in the initramfs.  Some patches to add that
functionality to <tt>cpio</tt> have been posted, but she wonders if there
is a maintainer of the tool that will pick up and maintain that work.
</p>

<p>
All code and data that gets loaded into the kernel needs to be able to be
measured and have signatures verified.  That includes kernel modules,
policy files, and so on.  New system calls that take file descriptor
parameters allow IMA to access the needed security xattrs.  But she is
concerned that BPF programs may avoid measurement and verification since
file descriptors are not part of the API for loading them.
</p>

<p>
There are still some kinds of attacks that are not being thwarted; the most
major is that file names can be changed in an offline attack.  Protecting
against that would require hashing and verifying the directory
structure. Symbolic and hard links would both provide ways to have
different names for the same file, however, as was pointed out by several
in the room.  It is the reason that SELinux protects objects and not files
by name, Ted Ts'o noted.
</p>

<p>
Namespace support for IMA is another area that needs attention, Zohar
said.  IMA-measurement needs per-namespace policies and IMA-appraisal needs
per-namespace keyrings.  She concluded her talk by asking the assembled
developers to help ensure that new features did not add measurement or
appraisal gaps.  There are some difficult problems that need solving
for IMA and she would like some help from the filesystem developers in
doing so.

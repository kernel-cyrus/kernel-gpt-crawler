<p>
Power-efficient workqueues were first introduced in the 
3.11 kernel release; since then, fifty or so
subsystems and drivers have been updated to use them. These workqueues
can be especially useful on handheld devices (like tablets and
smartphones), where power is at a premium.
ARM platforms with power-efficient workqueues enabled on Ubuntu and
Android have shown significant improvements in energy consumption (up to
15% for some use cases).</p>

<p>Workqueues (wq) are the most common deferred-execution mechanism used in the
Linux kernel for cases where an asynchronous execution context is
required. That context is provided by the
worker kernel threads, which are woken whenever a
work item is queued for them.  A workqueue is represented by the
<tt>workqueue_struct</tt> structure, and work items are represented by
<tt>struct work_struct</tt>. The latter includes a pointer to a function
which is called by the worker (in process context) to execute the
work. Once the worker has finished processing all the work items queued on
the workqueue, it becomes idle.</p>

<p>The most common APIs used to queue work are:</p>

<pre>
    bool queue_work(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work);
    bool queue_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work);
    bool queue_delayed_work(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct delayed_work *dwork, 
			    unsigned long delay);
    bool queue_delayed_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq, 
			       struct delayed_work *work, unsigned long delay);
</pre>

<p>The first two functions queue the work for immediate execution, while
the other two queue 
it to run after <tt>delay</tt> jiffies have passed. The work queued by
<tt>queue_work_on()</tt> (and 
<tt>queue_delayed_work_on()</tt>) is executed by the worker thread
running on the designated <tt>cpu</tt>.  The work queued by
<tt>queue_work()</tt> (and <tt>queue_delayed_work()</tt>), instead, can be
run by any CPU in the system (though it doesn't really happen that
way, as will be described later).</p>

<h4>The workqueue pinning problem</h4>

<p>A fairly common use case for workqueues in the kernel is to repetitively
run and requeue the work from the work function itself, as we need to do
some task periodically.  For example:
<pre>
    static void foo_handler(struct work_struct *work)
    {
        struct delayed_work *dwork = to_delayed_work(work);

	/* Do some work here */

	queue_delayed_work(system_wq, dwork, 10);
    }

    void foo_init(void)
    {
        struct delayed_work *dwork = kmalloc(sizeof(*dwork), GFP_KERNEL);

	INIT_DEFERRABLE_WORK(dwork, foo_handler);
	queue_delayed_work(system_wq, dwork, 10);
    }
</pre>

<p><tt>foo_init()</tt> allocates the delayed work structure and queues it
with a ten-jiffy delay.
The work handler (<tt>foo_handler()</tt>) performs
the periodic work and queues itself again.
<p>
One might think that the work
will be executed on any CPU (whichever the kernel finds to be most
appropriate). But that's not really true.
The workqueue core will most likely queue it on the local CPU
(the CPU where <tt>queue_delayed_work()</tt> was called), unless
the local CPU isn't part of the global
<tt>wq_unbound_cpumask</tt>. On an eight-core platform, for example, the
work function 
shown above will be executed on the same CPU every time, even if that
CPU is idle and some of the other seven CPUs were not.</p>

<p>The <tt>wq_unbound_cpumask</tt> is the mask of CPUs that are
allowed to execute work which isn't queued to a particular CPU
(i.e. work queued with queue_work() and queue_delayed_work()). It can be
found in sysfs as <tt>devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask</tt>.
This mask is
used to keep such work items confined to a specific group of CPUs  and can be
useful in cases like heterogeneous CPU architectures, where we
want to execute such work items on low-power CPUs only, or with CPU
isolation, where we don't want such work items to execute on CPUs
doing important, performance-sensitive work. This mask can't be used
to get rid of the pinning problem described above, though;
if the local CPU is part of the
<tt>wq_unbound_cpumask</tt>, then queue_work() will keep queuing the
work there.</p>

<p>It is probably fine (from power-efficiency point of view) if a CPU is
interrupted to run a workqueue while it is doing some other work.
But if the CPU is
brought out of the idle state solely to service the timer and queue the
work, more power than necessary will be consumed.
Pinning may also not be good for performance in
certain cases, as the selected CPU may not be the best available CPU to run
the work function. Also, the scheduler is unable
to load-balance this work with other CPUs and the response time of the
work function may increase if the target CPU is currently
busy.</p>

<h4>Power-efficient workqueues</h4>

<p>The power-efficient workqueue infrastructure is disabled by default, as
we may want the same work items to be either power
or performance-oriented depending on the current system configuration.
These workqueues can be enabled by either passing
<tt>workqueue.power_efficient=true</tt> on the kernel command line or
enabling the <tt>CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT</tt>  configuration option.
The command line can also be used to disable this feature
(if enabled in the kernel configuration) by setting
<tt>workqueue.power_efficient=false</tt>.</p>

<p>Once the power-efficient workqueue functionality is enabled, a workqueue
can be made to run in the power-efficient mode by passing
the <tt>WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT</tt> flag 
to <tt>alloc_workqueue()</tt>  when creating the
workqueue. There are two system-level workqueues that run in this mode as
well: <tt>system_power_efficient_wq</tt> and
<tt>system_freezable_power_efficient_wq</tt>; they can be used when a
private workqueue is not needed.

<p>
Instead of running work on the local CPU, the workqueue core asks
the scheduler to provide the target CPU for the work queued on unbound
workqueues (which includes those marked as power-efficient).
So they will not get pinned on a single CPU as can happen with regular
workqueues. 

<p>
Unfortunately, that does not mean that the scheduler always picks the
optimal CPU to run a workqueue task.  The algorithm responsible for picking
the CPU for a task 
is complex but, more likely than not, the scheduler will pick the least
busy CPU among those sharing the same last-level cache. For a multi-cluster
platform, it will most likely pick a CPU from the same cluster. But if the
work handler doesn't finish quickly, load balancing will happen
and that may move the task to another, possibly idle, CPU.</p>

<p>Thus, with
the current design of Linux kernel scheduler, we may not get the best
results (though they should still be good enough) with power-efficient
workqueues. There is ongoing work (strongly pushed by the ARM community) to
make the scheduler more power-aware and power-efficient in general; this
work will also benefit  power-efficient workqueues.
Currently, they are a bit more useful (from power-efficiency point of
view) with the Android kernel, which carries some scheduler modifications
to make it more energy-aware.</p>

<p>It is natural to wonder whether
all workqueues should run in the power-efficient mode.
But power-efficient workqueues have one disadvantage: they may end up
executing the work item on a different CPU every time, incurring
lots of cache misses, depending on how much data the work handler
accesses. 
This can significantly hurt the performance of the system when
workqueue tasks run often and need their caches to be hot.
On the other hand, this can be good, performance wise, in some cases where
cache misses are not a big issue,
as the scheduler can do load
balancing and the response time for the work items may improve.
So one needs to evaluate the users of the workqueues carefully and
see which configuration (power-efficient or not) they fit best with.

<h4>Power numbers</h4>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/548281/">I ran some benchmarks</a>
on a 
32-bit ARM big.LITTLE platform with four Cortex A7 cores and four
Cortex A15 cores.  Audio was played in background using <tt>aplay</tt> while
the rest of the system was fairly idle. Linaro's ubuntu-devel
distribution was used and the kernel also had some out-of-tree scheduler
changes.
The results across multiple test iterations showed average improvement
of 15.7% in energy consumption with power-efficient workqueues
enabled. The  numbers shown here are in joules.
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th></th><th>Vanilla kernel +<br>scheduler patches</th>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Vanilla Kernel +<br>scheduler patches +<br>power-efficient wq</th></tr>
<tr><td>A15&nbsp;cluster</td><td align="right">0.322866</td><td></td><td align="right">0.2289042</td></tr>
<tr><td>A7 cluster</td><td align="right">2.619137</td><td></td><td align="right">2.2514632</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td align="right">2.942003</td><td></td><td align="right">2.4803674</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>With the mainline kernel, the power-efficient workqueues will give
better results today as well since the scheduler picks  a better target CPU;
it will further improve as the scheduler gets more
energy aware.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Does an L2 cache miss on the core running the delayed work cause a wake up on idle cores to clear cache lines? Or is the L2 cache lost when a core goes into a low power state?<br>

It shouldn't. Generally L2 caches are tied (not necessarily but mostly) to cluster power domain.<br>
So as long as one CPU is active, cluster can't enter power off/retention state and hence L2 cache<br>
remains powered on. This is generally applicable on systems where cores just have L1 caches.<br>
However the recent cores have integrated L2 cache which will be powered off with core. In such<br>
systems the above in applicable to any cluster level L3 cache.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;Audio was played in background using aplay while the rest of the system was fairly idle.</font><br>
<p>
So the assumptions of this test design are that the memory read and then transcoding of the audio and its copy/dma to the sound output is handled more efficiently by workqueues targetting a quiesced CPU -- and underlying that, that race-to-idle is the optimal solution? How many parallel streams?<br>
<p>
The audio might be a straight-copy of PCM audio to an onboard DAC which can handle it natively (it might be that the sound chip can decode MP3, too) -- does it matter if it's scheduling a straight memcopy, or if it's merely setting up DMA's which finish quickly?<br>

So, this isn't really about audio as such. Audio was chosen as it puts very low load on the CPU and so most of the CPUs should be idle all the time. In general, most of the cases should get benefited from the power efficient workqueues, especially where CPU load is light. The idea is also not to choose a quiesced CPU, but choosing a CPU intelligently (which will improve going down the line with the scheduler becoming more energy aware). Right now it chooses the idlest CPU with the highest level of cache.<br>

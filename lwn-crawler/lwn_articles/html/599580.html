Most LWN readers are likely aware of the doom impending upon us in January
2038, when the <tt>time_t</tt> type used to store time values (in the form
of seconds since January&nbsp;1, 1970) runs out of bits on 32-bit systems.
It may be surprising that developers are increasingly worried about this
deadline, which is still nearly 24 years in the future, but there are good
reasons to be concerned now.  Whether those worries will lead to a solution
in the near term remains to be seen; not much has happened since <a
href="/Articles/563285/">this topic came up</a> last August. But recent
discussions have at least 
shed a bit of light on the forms such a solution might take.
<p>
At times, developers have hoped that this problem might solve itself.  On
64-bit systems, the <tt>time_t</tt> type has always been defined as a
64-bit quantity and will not run out
of space anytime soon.  Given that 64-bit systems appear to be taking over
the world — even phone handsets seem likely to make the switch in the next
few years — might the best solution be to just wait for 32-bit systems to
die out and take the problem with them?  A "no action required" solution
has an obvious appeal.
<p>
There are two problems with that
reasoning: (1)&nbsp;32-bit systems are likely to continue to be made for
far longer than most people might expect, and (2)&nbsp;there are 32-bit
systems being deployed now that can be expected to have lifetimes of 24
years or longer.  32-bit systems will be useful as cheap microcontrollers
for a long time, and, once deployed, they will often be expected to work
for many years while being difficult or impossible to update.  There are
almost certainly systems already deployed 
that are going to provide unpleasant surprises in 2038.
<p>
<h4>Kernel-based solutions</h4>
<p>
So it would appear to make sense to solve the problem soon, rather than in,
say, 2036 or so.  There is only one snag: the problem is not all that easy
to solve.  At least, it is not easy if one is concerned about little
details like not breaking existing programs.  Since Linux developers at
most levels are quite concerned about compatibility, the simplest solutions
(such as a BSD-style ABI break) are not seen as being workable.  In a
recent discussion, John Stultz <a 
href="/Articles/599582/">outlined a couple of alternative approaches</a>,
neither of which is without its difficulties.
<p>
The first approach would be to change the 32-bit ABI to use a 64-bit
version of <tt>time_t</tt> (related data structures like, <tt>struct
timespec</tt> and <tt>struct timeval</tt> would also change).  Old binaries
could be supported through a compatibility 
interface, but newly compiled code would normally use the new ABI.  There
are some advantages to this approach, starting with the fact that lots of
applications could be updated simply by rebuilding them.  Since a couple of
BSD variants have already taken this path, a number of the worst
application problems 
have already been fixed.  Embedded microcontrollers typically run custom
distributions built entirely from source; changing the ABI in this way
would make it possible to build 2038-capable systems in the near future
with a minimum of pain.
<p>
On the other hand, the kernel would have to maintain a significant
compatibility layer for a long time.  Developers are also worried that
there will be many applications that store 32-bit <tt>time_t</tt> values in
their own data structures, in on-disk formats, and more.  Many of these
applications could break in surprising ways, and they could prove to be
difficult to fix.  There are also some concerns about the runtime cost of
using 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> values on 32-bit systems.  Much of this cost
could be mitigated within the kernel by using a different format
internally, but applications could slow down as well.
<p>
The alternative approach is to simply define a new set of system calls, all
of which are defined to use better time formats from the beginning.  The
new formats could address other irritations at the same time; not everybody
likes the separate seconds and nanoseconds fields used in <tt>struct
timespec</tt>, for example.  All system calls defined to use the old
<tt>time_t</tt> values would be deprecated, with the idea of removing them,
if possible, before 2038.
<p>
With this approach, there would be no hard ABI break anytime soon and
applications could be migrated gradually.  Once again, embedded systems
could be built using the new system calls in the relatively near future,
while desktop systems could be left alone for another decade or so.  And it
would be a chance to start over  and redesign some longstanding system
calls with 21st-century needs in mind.
<p>
Defining new system calls has its downsides as well, though.  It would
push Linux further away from being a POSIX system, and would take us down a
path different from the one chosen by the BSD world.  There are a
<i>lot</i> of system calls to replace, and <tt>time_t</tt> values show up
in other places as well, most notably in a long list of <tt>ioctl()</tt>
calls.  Applications would have to be updated, including those running only
on 64-bit systems, which would not see much of a benefit from the new
system calls.  And, undoubtedly, there would be lots of applications using
the older system calls that would surface in 2037.  So this approach is not
an easy solution either.
<p>
<h4>Including glibc</h4>
<p>
Discussions of these alternatives went on for a surprisingly long time
before Christoph Hellwig made an (in retrospect) obvious <a
href="/Articles/599583/">suggestion</a>: the C library developers are going
to have to be involved in the implementation of any real solution to the
year-2038 problem, so perhaps they should be part of the discussion
now.  For years, communications between the kernel community and the
developers of C libraries (including the GNU C library — glibc) have been
sporadic at best.  The changing of the guard at glibc has made productive
conversations easier to have, but changing old habits has proved hard.  In
any case, it is true that the glibc developers will have to be involved in
the design 
of the solution to this problem; the good news is that such involvement
appears likely to happen.
<p>
Glibc developers are not known for their love of ABI breaks — or of
non-POSIX interfaces for that matter.  So, once glibc developer Joseph Myers <a
href="/Articles/599591/">joined the conversation</a>, the tone shifted a
bit toward a solution that would allow a smooth transition while retaining
existing POSIX system calls and application compatibility.  The plan (which
was discussed only in rough form and would need a lot of work yet) looks
something like this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Create new, 64-bit versions of the affected system calls.  So, for 
     example, there would be a <tt>gettimeofday64()</tt> that returns the
     time in a <tt>struct timeval64</tt>.  The existing versions of these
     system calls would be unchanged.
<p>
<li> Glibc would gain a new feature test macro with a name like
     <tt>TIME_BITS</tt>.  If <tt>TIME_BITS=64</tt> on a 32-bit system, a
     call to <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> will be remapped to
     <tt>gettimeofday64()</tt> within the library.  So applications can opt
     into the new world by building with an appropriate value of
     <tt>TIME_BITS</tt> defined.
<p>
<li> Eventually, <tt>TIME_BITS=64</tt> would become the default, probably
     after distributions had been shipping in that mode for a while.  Even
     in the 64-bit configuration, compatibility symbols would remain so
     that older binaries would still work against newer versions of the C
     library. 
</ul>
<p>
Such an approach could possibly allow for a relatively smooth transition to
a system that will work in 2038, though, naturally, a number of troublesome
details 
remain.  There was talk of remapping <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls in a similar
way, but that looks like a recipe for trouble given just how many of those
calls there are and how hard it would be to even find them all.  Developers
in other C library projects, who often don't wish to maintain the sort of
extensive compatibility infrastructure found in glibc, may wish to take a
different approach.  And so on.
<p>
But, even with its challenges, the existence of a vague plan hashed out
with participation from kernel and glibc developers is reason for hope.
Maybe, just maybe, some sort of reasonably robust solution to the 2038
problem will be found before it becomes absolutely urgent, and, with luck,
before lots of systems that will need to function properly in 2038 are
deployed.  We have the opportunity to avoid a year-2038 panic at a
relatively low cost; if we make use of that opportunity, our future selves
will thank us.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Uh oh. Claiming that TIME_BITS=64 could allow a smooth transition is really wrong. The type time_t is exposed in numerous library APIs. The TIME_BITS=64 thing suggests one could mix and match components compiled with different settings freely, but that is not the case: if you compile one lib with 64bit time_t then you have to do the same for all programs using that lib. And if you do that the  you transitively have to recompile all other libs they are using too, and so on. Ultimately you have to recompile the full system that way... Unless of course every single library would do what glibc does and provide both 32bit and 64bit calls for everything. And that's just not going to happen.<br>
<p>
The same story happened for large file support (LFS) where off_t got increased in size. Now, off_t is thankfully not that often exposed in APIs, and because people knew how awful the situation was many just avoided exposing it in APIs, but for time_t the situation is much worse.<br>
<p>
Also, one particular gem: think of stat() which already exists in two flavours, with LFS and without. Now, this API would also have to be duplicated for 32bit time_t and 64bit time_t. So you get four flavours of this call: stat(), stat64(), stat_t64() and stat64_t64()! Ouch!<br>
<p>
And even thinking of duplicating gettimeofday() when there's also clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) is just wrong...<br>

Since stat() without LFS support is only for compatability, I assume it would suffice to add a stat64_t64 (with hopefully a better name). But having three variants is bad enough.<br>

For the particular example, we have been talking about a replacement for stat that solves a number of other problems as well. See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/394298/">http://lwn.net/Articles/394298/</a> for instance.<br>

      I hope going to 64-bit time_t is selected, like the BSD:s did. Given the human tendency of putting off chores with no immediate benefit, harshly imposing the fix when code is recompiled is the only way to get this solved before the deadline.

My feeling is that at the kernel interface side, we won't do a hard break, and keep 32-bit time_t at least for the architectures that have it today while introducing new syscalls to take to the libc.<br>
<p>
What user space does is a different matter though. I think you should always have at least the option to build a libc that only supports 64-bit time_t in user space and that uses the new kernel interfaces for a safe implementation. This way, an enterprise distro with e.g. 10 years of guaranteed support and lots of legacy third-party applications can keep working as previously, while an embedded system with 25 years support and no legacy code can go to 64-bit time_t in user space without any backwards compat hacks in user space.<br>

Would it be possible to change the epoch date?  For example, setting an environment variable like $EPOCH_YEAR to 2010 would make the 32 bit time_t relative to midnight UTC, January 1, 2010.  Methods like localtime() would take this offset into account.  Somehow, the kernel would have to be informed that the process is running with an epoch offset, but presumably that could be done during the process startup in glibc.<br>
<p>
Obviously this wouldn't solve situations where the time_t value is recorded outside the process (in a file, sent over the network, etc), so this wouldn't work for some subset of applications.  But most applications probably do not do that, so this workaround seems like it could be effective in cases where recompiling is not possible or desirable.<br>

      Running in a different epoch would work in situations where dates in the past do not need to be represented. But think about things like file time stamps that do indeed need to be in the past.

time_t is signed, so it can represent 68 years in either direction of the epoch (2^31/86400/365.25).  Setting the epoch to 2010 would allow representation from 1942 to 2078.<br>

      <P>Are negative<TT> time_t </TT>values really valid times, though?  There are APIs (such as<TT> time()</TT>) that return -1 to indicate an error.  The lazy programmer in me imagines that among programs that actually check for an error (which, admittedly, are probably rare), the majority would just check for less-than-zero.</P>

True, that would probably preclude setting your epoch date in the future (say to 2050 so you could span between 1982 and 2118).  At the very least, there would be a time (December 31, 23:59:59) when time() would have to legitimately return -1, which is the error code.<br>
<p>
But if the epoch date is in the recent past, that wouldn't cause any trouble for the time() function.  I don't think any code would care if, for example, the time_t values in a stat structure are null.  As long as they are relatively consistent and localtime() returns the correct human translation.<br>

Ok, so now it's 2038, what does the 32-bit interface return after that? Or does it return 0x7FFFFFFF forever?<br>
<p>
I suppose what you could do is change the definition to reduce the resolution. So after 2030 it starts counting at half speed. In 2034 at quarter speed, 2036 one-eighth speed, etc. If you fix the APIs for strftime, ctime, etc everything will be transparent for most programs except the resolution gets worse.<br>
<p>
This of course screws people who do calculations on time_t though. You'll only see even seconds after that time. It might save you on file formats though. A sort floating point time_t...<br>

for a large percentage of the embedded devices, thinking that the date is 1904 instead of 2039 will not actually hurt things much. The biggest question is how everything will handle the rollover<br>

But since embedded devices get reset and power cycled anyway, if they do have problems, resetting them if not going to be that unusual an action.<br>

and then there is a category that cares about the day of the week (or month), and for those you can pick a time in the available window where the calendar matches up.<br>

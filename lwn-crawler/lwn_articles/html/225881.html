<h1>paravirt_ops considered harmful?</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
As flame wars go, this one was somewhat more technical and inscrutable than
most.  It was, however, still a flame war.  The core issue was this: is the
addition of the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194543/">paravirt_ops</a>
layer, now beginning to be used to support running Linux under hypervisors,
a good thing or a long-term maintenance disaster for the Linux kernel?
<p>

It all started with a patch added to the -mm tree; it seems that some work
on the new <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/223185/">clockevents</a> code
broke the VMI virtualization layer.  So the developers at VMware put
together a fix, but that fix did not sit well with the core clockevents
developers.  In their view, it took much of the older time-related code,
which they had worked so hard to get rid of, and shoved it back under the
VMI layer.  Thomas Gleixner <a href="/Articles/225882/">did not like</a>
this solution:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is ugly as hell. NO_HZ enables the dyntick functions in
	idle(), irq_enter() and irq_exit() so the clockevents code is
	actually invoked.  I have not looked close enough why this does
	work at all.
	I have the feeling that "working fine" means something like "does not
	explode".
</div>
<p>
The right solution, according to Thomas, is for all of the people who are
working on hypervisors and Linux to get together and come up with a single
timer interface based on clockevents.  This should not be all that hard of
a job, in his opinion.  The VMI hackers may well be willing to do that over
time, but they don't see that as something which can be done in the near
future.  Their current code works, and, besides, they are on the verge of a
product release and would rather not thrash things up at this time.
<p>

"On the verge of a product release" is not an excuse which flies far on
linux-kernel.  This is doubly true in this case, where some of the people
involved feel that the VMI developers should have seen clockevents coming
and developed for that interface over the last year.  They see the current
VMI timer code as being the beginning of a long-term maintenance
nightmare.  
<p>

Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/225884/">widened the discussion</a> to the
problems he sees with paravirt_ops in general.  The posting is long, but
the core point seems to be this: every hypervisor connection implemented
with paravirt_ops becomes an ABI that the kernel must then maintain
forever.  The paravirt_ops interface itself is supposed to insulate the
kernel from changes, and that API can change.  But each hypervisor
interface done through paravirt_ops must continue to work into the future,
meaning that certain sorts of fundamental design changes cannot be made.
Maintaining compatibility with several hypervisors will be hard, and <a
href="/Articles/225887/">Ingo sees bad things</a> when one inevitably
breaks:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And it doesn't matter whether we think that it was VMWare who messed
	up.  Users/customers _will_ blame us: "v2.6.25 regresses, it wont
	run under ESX v1.12 anymore". Distro will yield and will undo
	whatever change breaks backwards compatibility with older
	hypervisors. (most likely it will be undone upstream already)
	Backwards compatibility acts as a very heavy barrier against
	certain types of paravirt_ops design changes.
</div>
<p>

There have not been a whole lot of others supporting this point of view,
though.  The current abuses are seen as things which can be fixed, people
seem to be sanguine about the ability to maintain compatibility in the
paravirt_ops interface code, and, most likely, many people simply tune out
of virtualization discussions.  Linus <a
href="/Articles/225889/">suggests</a> that Ingo point out specific problems
(and fix them if he desires) rather than complaining about general
problems.  Ingo's response is that hypervisor interfaces should be treated
like system calls, and added with the same degree of care and deliberation.
<p>

In the end, it is not clear that anything will change.  There is a high
level of interest in getting hypervisor support into the kernel, and that
process is unlikely to stop.  So expect to see some more serious squabbles
about what is done in hypervisor interfaces in the future.  If we are
lucky, that process, while noisy, will result in the evolution of the
paravirt_ops code toward something which proves to be maintainable over the
long term.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

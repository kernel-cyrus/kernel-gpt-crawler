<h1>Toward more robust network-based block I/O</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 8, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
One thing which came out of <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2005/">this
year's Kernel Summit</a> is that the kernel still does not deal well with
network-based block devices when memory gets tight.  If the system is full
of dirty memory, the kernel must write some of those dirty pages to their
backing store so that the memory may be reused.  But the act of writing
that data over the network can require the allocation of more memory.  Even
worse, completing network-based I/O requires the ability to receive the
acknowledgment packets back from the remote device.  Not only does that
packet reception require memory, but the system must contend with the fact
that the network could also be the source of vast numbers of packets which
are completely unrelated to the problem at hand.  If the system cannot find
a way to receive the packets it needs while ignoring unrelated packets,
extreme memory pressure will eventually lead to a lockup.
<p>

Solving this problem is hard.  At the Summit, Linus suggested that it might
not even make sense to try; instead, users should be directed toward I/O
hardware which does not present this sort of problem.  In reality, however,
Linux will do its best to support network-based block devices.  Daniel
Phillips has recently been working on <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/146652/">a patch</a> which tries to make some
progress in that direction.
<p>

Like many before him, Daniel bases his approach on the use of preallocated
memory pools - a chunk of memory which is set aside for use when no other
memory is available.  Daniel has tried to take things a little further by
quantifying how much memory should be set aside.  To that end, each network
driver should, when an interface is brought up, make a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int adjust_memalloc_reserve(int pages);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>pages</tt> is the number of pages required to be able to continue
to receive packets on the given interface.  A helper function,
<tt>estimate_skb_pages()</tt>, can come up with a guess for how many pages
will be required to hold a given number of packets with a specified maximum
size.  The call to <tt>adjust_memalloc_reserve()</tt> will cause the
virtual memory subsystem to set aside the given number of pages for
emergency use by the driver.  In this way, it is hoped, the system will
reserve a sufficient amount of memory without being overly wasteful.
<p>

Memory can be allocated from the reserve by adding the new
<tt>__GFP_MEMALLOC</tt> flag to the allocation request.  A new networking
helper function, <tt>dev_memalloc_skb()</tt>, will use that flag if
necessary to obtain a packet.  Before doing so, however, it checks a count
of packets allocated from the reserve; no interface is allowed to allocate
beyond a maximum count, which defaults to&nbsp;50.  Unlike previous versions of
the patch, the current code does not attempt to track which packets, in
particular, were allocated from reserve memory.  Any packets which
originate from a given device will, when returned to the system, be
credited to that device's reserve.
<p>

A longstanding problem with the reserve approach is that, if one is not
careful, the reserve simply gets depleted and the system runs out of memory
anyway.  In a situation where memory use is not entirely within the system's
control - when dealing with incoming network data, for example - this sort
of depletion is especially likely.  Your system may be doing its best to
flush dirty pages to your home iSCSI array, but the network memory reserves
are full of incoming music being downloaded by your children, so the entire
system comes to a halt.  Such an outcome may please the RIAA, but the
kernel developers are trying to satisfy a different audience.
<p>

Daniel's answer to this problem is to add a special flag to network sockets
which are involved in block I/O.  Only sockets marked with
<tt>SOCK_MEMALLOC</tt> are entitled to use packet memory from the
reserves.  When the packet arrives on the interface, the system cannot know
whether it is useful or not, so that packet must be received (possibly
using reserve memory) and fed into the system in
the usual way.  The protocol code, however, is expected to check each
packet to see whether it comes from a device which is currently using
reserve memory.  If so, and the packet does not belong to a suitably-marked
socket, that packet is to be dropped immediately.  In this way, it is
hoped, the system will be able to focus its remaining resources on
recovering from its memory crunch.  
<p>

This approach may have some promise.  This patch needs some work, however,
before it is ready for serious stress testing.  Once it has been worked
into shape, the patch can be applied to a suitably-equipped system, which
can then be pushed into a state of serious memory pressure.  That point
has been the downfall of a number of other approaches to this problem;
whether Daniel's work is up to this test remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Thanks Jon, for once again expressing this all more succintly than I ever could.  A subtle point:<br>
<p>
"The protocol code... is expected to check each packet to see whether it comes from a device which is currently using reserve memory. If so, and the packet does not belong to a suitably-marked socket, that packet is to be dropped immediately."<br>
<p>
...and the tasks driving the competing traffic are likely to be blocked waiting for memory to be freed, or soon will be.  So the competing traffic problem is self-correcting.<br>
<p>
Of course we need to worry not just about whether the system avoids deadlock under load, but that it keeps running smoothly.  The vm system's highwater/lowwater scheme lets it get out of the way for a while after relieving memory pressure, a natural way of sharing network bandwidth with normal tasks.<br>
<p>
However, we are not quite out of the woods yet.  As soon as atomic allocs start to fail, the current patch starts dropping non-blockio packets, which might cause user-visible protocol stalls.  But the machine does not exist solely to write out dirty memory - we want everything to keep running smoothly, not just block IO.  After all, under load these low memory conditions are the rule, not the exception.  Fortunately, this behavior is easily tunable: we can adjust the threshold at which non-blockio packets begin to be dropped, effectively giving non-vm traffic access to part of the reserve.  When nicely tuned, the vm-related throttling should cause the non-blockio network traffic to taper off just as the vm writeout traffic begins to rise and no packets will ever have to be dropped.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Daniel<br>

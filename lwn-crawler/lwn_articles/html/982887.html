David Howells wanted to discuss swap handling in light of multi-page folios
in a combined storage, filesystem, and memory-management session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  Swapping has always been
done with a one-to-one mapping of memory pages to swap slots, he said, but
swapping multi-page folios breaks that assumption.  He wondered if it would
make sense to use filesystem techniques to track swapped-out folios.
</p>

<p>
Traditional swap is divided into page-sized segments, Howells began, and, up
until recently, memory was divided the same way.  When the kernel wanted to swap
something out, it found a free segment and put the contents of the page
there; the reverse of that was done when it needed to swap the page back
in.  But, with folios,
there might be two pages, 2MB of pages, or even 2GB of pages joined
together that need to be swapped out as a unit.
</p>

height=290>
</a>

<p>
The locations where those pages get stored on disk need to be recorded;
there may not be a contiguous region in the swap space to hold the full
folio due to fragmentation. To him, it looks like reinventing a filesystem;
"we don't want to do that, we've already got a whole bunch of filesystems".
He wondered if there could be a filesystem mechanism added where a block of
data, such as a 2MB folio, can be stored with a specific key.  That key
can be used to retrieve the block or to cancel it, if it is no longer of interest.
</p>

<p>
He maintains <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/caching/fscache.html">FS-Cache</a>,
which is a local disk cache for network filesystems, that has similar
needs; it stores blocks from remote files in a local on-disk cache.  So
there are two separate caches that have many of the same properties; does
it make sense to combine them?  They could share the same pool of reserved
disk space and FS-Cache could fill up the entire space if it needs to; swap
can always get the space that it needs because FS-Cache is a true cache, so
any of its entries can simply be removed.
</p>

<p>
Howells noted that Chris Li's <a href="/Articles/974587/">session on a swap
abstraction</a>, which would have a
different take on changes to the swap layer,  was coming up in the next
summit slot.  Howells asked for attendees'
thoughts on the idea of merging FS-Cache and swap.  Jeff Layton was
concerned that the current FS-Cache uses <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/caching/cachefiles.html">cachefilesd</a>,
which may allocate memory; using that mechanism for swapping could lead to
a deadlock.  Howells said that if the two were combined, cachefilesd would
no longer be used. That functionality would move into the kernel so that it
could track both swap and FS-Cache entries; the new code would not allocate memory to
do so.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley said that filesystems could already provide what Howells was
looking for with a generic extent map and some form of pre-allocation.  He
suggested that the block layer did not need to be involved at all; "if
that's the solution, can we go on to the next session?"  As might be
guessed, there was more to work out than that; Howells said that an
interface was still needed, but "I don't know if anyone has any particular
insight" on it.  He noted that Kent Overstreet had thoughts of providing it
from bcachefs.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
What had been described is a kind of object storage, Jan Kara said.  He
agreed that it was basically a filesystem question; it is nearly trivial to
expose an API like what is needed, but there are a lot of constraints to be
worked out.  The FS-Cache piece is easy, but fitting swap into that is much
harder; he remembers how difficult it was to get swap-over-NFS working, so
making this combined cache work reliably in close-to-out-of-memory
conditions "needs some serious thought".  For that, patches are more
important than discussion, because of all of the little details that need to
be handled.
</p>

<p>
Li asked about using <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html">zram</a> as a
backing device and thought that a separate kind of swap-handling would be
needed in that case. Kara said that the point of zram is to compress the
data, but the filesystem can do that compression instead.  But Li said that
filesystem compression is done on a per-file basis, so the whole file would
have to be decompressed to access some of its blocks.  Overstreet said that
"the right way to do compression is per extent". 
</p>

<p>
The information about swapped blocks is stored in memory, Dave Chinner
said, so it simply goes away if the system crashes.  There is no need for
persistence of that information, but he wondered if that was also true for
FS-Cache.  Howells agreed that the data did not need to persist if the
system crashed.  That means the existing swap-file support mostly takes
care of what is needed, Chinner said; all that needs to be added is support
for a variable-length block size to deal with various folio sizes.  The
metadata can be stored in memory, since it does not need to
persist, and can use the B-tree code from, say, XFS or bcachefs to manage
the extents; it is efficient and easy to do, he said.
</p>

<p>
But Howells said that the FS-Cache did need to persist, though not across
crashes; when the system is rebooted, the contents of FS-Cache should
persist.  That invalidates the idea of using swap files as the basis of the
feature, Chinner said, "you need an actual filesystem at that point".
Bottomley wondered what was stored in FS-Cache that can be destroyed in a 
crash, but must be preserved on a reboot.  Howells said that the FS-Cache data is
valuable, so he would prefer not to get rid of it, but it is a real cache
so the files could be recreated if needed—at a fairly high cost.
</p>

<p>
So the question then becomes "how valuable is FS-Cache persistence?", Bottomley said.  Howells said that it is "very valuable" and
that there are many customers that use it.  Layton added that some of those
customers are doing big rendering jobs with huge files; "the last thing
they want to do when it comes up is throw away their cache because then it
will slam their server" to retrieve the files.
</p>

<p>
The key that would be used for the FS-Cache files is based on several
pieces of data that identifies the remote file being stored, but Howells
had not mentioned anything about the key for swap data, Matthew Wilcox
said.  In today's swap code in the memory-management layer, much of the
pain is that there are "these sort-of address spaces, not exactly address
spaces" that are used to allocate space in; that is done with a data
structure that is not good for allocation, using locks that don't really
scale, he said. "It's all a bit ... awful."
</p>

<p>
Wilcox wondered if Howells had a proposal for what the key for the swap
items would be or if he was looking to the memory-management community to
come up with one.  Howells said that he had assumed it would be based on
the host inode number and a page offset within it, but realized that would not cover
anonymous memory.  Wilcox thought that maybe the VMA structure could be
used, but Kara noted that those can be split and merged, which would
invalidate the key.
</p>

<p>
Li said that the swap offset, which is an index into the array of swap
slots, is what is used at swap-out time and what gets stored in the swap
entry, so it should be used as the key.  But he was concerned about the
amount of overhead that would be consumed if, for example, an inode was
allocated for each swap slot.  Wilcox said that it was important to
move away from swap offsets and slots, since that is what causes the "real
scalability problems in the swap subsystem".
</p>

<p>
There will be a need for some kind of mapping layer to map the page-based
swap offset (because the least-recently-used (LRU) list is maintained on a
page basis) to some internal file, inode, or something else.  Wilcox said that
he is thinking that the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.10/source/include/linux/rmap.h#L17"><tt>struct&nbsp;anon_vma</tt></a>
used for anonymous memory areas could be used; it "looks and feels to me an
awful lot like an 
inode", though it is not an exact fit.  When you add <a
href="/Articles/333783/">reflinks</a>, which are copy-on-write links to
files, into the mix, an <tt>anon_vma</tt> is even more like an inode, he
said.
</p>

<p>
Adding something that is "akin to the page cache in each
<tt>anon_vma</tt> structure", if done properly, could also solve "all of
the problems that we have around caching reflinked files".  Many sessions
at LSFMM over the last ten years have had complaints about the lack of
page-sharing in the page cache between files that are reflinked, Wilcox
said; "if we make both of these problems the same problem, maybe that will
be the final impetus we need to get this problem fixed".
</p>

<p>
Li and Wilcox went back and forth some about how that would look, what
would need to be stored in the swap entry, and where the swap entry would
be stored.  No real conclusions were reached and Li said that he would like
to see a more concrete proposal.  To that end, Howells wondered if it would
make sense to convert tmpfs to use FS-Cache instead of the swap system;
Wilcox thought that would be a big improvement for tmpfs.  At that point,
the session ran out of time; we will have to wait and see what, if any,
patches emerge.

      For storing folios as extents, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/xfs-realtime-device">XFS real-time devices</a> seem well suited: the metadata structures are preallocated, and space is tracked for all power of two sizes.

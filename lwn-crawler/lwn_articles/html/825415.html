<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 7, 2020</br>
           </div>
When support for classic BPF was added to the kernel many years
ago, there was no question of whether BPF programs could block in their
execution.  Their functionality was limited to examining a packet's
contents and deciding whether the packet should be forwarded or not; there
was nothing such a program could do to block.  Since then, BPF has changed
a lot, but the assumption that BPF programs cannot sleep has been built
deeply into the BPF machinery.  More recently, classic BPF has been pushed
aside by the <a href="/Articles/740157/">extended BPF</a> dialect; the
wider applicability of extended BPF is now
forcing a rethink of some basic assumptions.
<p>
BPF programs can now do many things that were not possible for classic BPF
programs, including calling helper functions in the kernel, accessing data
structures ("maps") shared with the kernel or user space, and synchronizing
with spinlocks.  The core assumption that BPF programs are atomic has not
changed, though.  Once the kernel jumps into a BPF program, that program
must complete without doing anything that might put the thread it is
running in to sleep.  BPF programs themselves have no way of invoking any
sort of blocking action, and the helper functions exported to BPF programs
by the kernel are required to be atomic.
<p>
As BPF gains functionality and grows toward some sort of sentient
singularity moment, though, the inability to block is increasingly getting
in the way.  There has, thus, been interest in making BPF programs
sleepable for some time now, and that interest has recently expressed
itself as code
in the form of <a
href="/ml/netdev/20200630043343.53195-1-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/">this
patch set</a> from Alexei Starovoitov.
<p>
The patch adds a new flag, <tt>BPF_F_SLEEPABLE</tt>, that can be used when
loading BPF programs into the kernel; it marks programs that may sleep
during their execution.  That, in turn, informs the BPF verifier about the
nature of the program, and brings a number of new restrictions into
effect.  Most of these restrictions are the result of the simple fact that
the BPF subsystem was never designed with sleepable programs in mind.
Parts of that subsystem have been updated to handle sleeping programs
correctly, but many other parts have not.  That is likely to change over
time but, until then, the functionality implemented by any part of the BPF
subsystem that still expects atomicity is off-limits to sleepable programs.
<p>
For example, of the many types of BPF programs supported by the kernel,
only two are allowed to block: those run from the Linux
security module subsystem and tracing programs (<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM</tt>
and <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING</tt>).  Even then, tracing programs can only
sleep if they are attached to security hooks or are attached to functions
that have been set up for <a 
href="/Articles/740146/">error injection</a>.  Other types of programs are
likely to be added in the future, but the coverage will never be
universal.  Many types of BPF programs are invoked from within contexts
that, themselves, do not allow sleeping — deep within the network
packet-processing code or attached to atomic functions, for example — so
making those programs sleepable is just not going to happen.
<p>
Sleepable BPF programs are also limited in the types of maps they can
access; anything but hash or array maps is out of bounds.  There is a
further restriction with hash maps: they must be preallocated so that
elements need not be allocated while a sleepable program is running.  Most
of the internal housekeeping within maps is currently done using
read-copy-update (RCU), a protection scheme that breaks down if a BPF
program is blocked while holding a reference to a map entry.  The hash and
array maps have been extended to use <a href="/Articles/607117/">RCU
tasks</a>, which can handle sleeping code, for some operations.  Once
again, it seems likely that support for the combination of BPF maps and
sleepable programs will grow over time.
<p>
Sleepable BPF programs, thus, run with a number of restrictions that do not
apply to the atomic variety.  With Starovoitov's patch set, there is
exactly one thing they can do that's unavailable to atomic BPF programs; it
takes the form of a new helper function:
<p>
<pre>
    long bpf_copy_from_user(void *dest, u32 size, const void *user_ptr);
</pre>
<p>
This helper is a wrapper around the kernel's <tt>copy_from_user()</tt>
function, which copies data from user space into the kernel.  User-space
data may not be resident in RAM when a call like this is made, so callers
must always be prepared to block while one or more pages are brought in
from secondary storage.  This has prevented BPF programs from reading
user-space data directly; now sleepable BPF programs will be able to do
so.  One potential use for this ability would be to allow security-related
BPF programs to follow user-space pointers and get a better idea of what
user space is actually up to.
<p>
This patch set is in its fifth revision as of this writing and seems likely
to find its way into the mainline during the 5.9 merge window.  After that,
the restrictions on what sleepable BPF programs can do are likely to start
getting in the way of users, so it would not be surprising to see work
loosening those restrictions showing up relatively quickly.  For some use
cases, at least, BPF insomnia should soon be a thing of the past.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I note that the most recent Fedora release no longer creates a swap partition or swap file by default.  Instead there is swapping to zram.  But perhaps we are nearing the day when even that won&#x27;t be necessary and systems won&#x27;t have swap any more.  If you also got rid of demand paging for executables, and assuming for the moment that memory-mapped files need not be handled, how much kernel could could be simplified out once you know that all user-space data is always in physical RAM?<br>

You&#x27;re still going to LRU files listed in the VFS cache, and maybe that would go away when you&#x27;ve got enough spare RAM to pin a mount point into the cache -- operating (eg root and home partitions) from RAM at the cost of being write heavy keeping disk in fsync().<br>

Unless I&#x27;ve misunderstood, the VFS cache is not user-space data.  I meant if you can assume that all of a user process&#x27;s address space (apart from memory-mapped files) is in RAM and so there is no possibility of having to wait for it to be paged in.<br>

      That would be so hugely wasteful of RAM that I have a hard time seeing it ever happening. Programs have a tendency to never access large parts of their address spaces.  And that's before you get into other tricks, like copy-on-write or memory shared with devices, that can cause faults.  You'll be waiting a long time waiting for that particular simplification, I think.

If you apply the rule of thumb that swap space should equal twice the physical RAM(*), then you only need triple the amount of RAM to eliminate swap altogether.  That could happen in a year or two depending on how well Moore&#x27;s Law applies to RAM production.  Of course, software becomes more bloated at the same time, which is why we still have swap space, but I think the improvement in machine size is slowly outstripping the rate at which programmers can add bloat.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, Android systems don&#x27;t have swap space.  I would expect most embedded Linux systems to do without it also.  A spinning disk is too slow, and swapping to flash memory wears it out.  Meanwhile supercomputers will normally run a specialized application designed to fit into physical RAM.  It&#x27;s the medium-sized systems that still use swap, as a kind of last resort before breaking out the OOM killer.  I think this middle space is likely to shrink in the years to come.<br>
<p>
I take your point that programs may allocate a huge address space and then use little of it.  That&#x27;s a slightly different issue from swap: no 64-bit system has a swap file big enough for the whole virtual address space that some process might make, and you can have huge (but mostly empty) address spaces with no swap at all.  But it would invalidate the property that access to user memory can never block.  If the page had been allocated but not touched, a page fault would still be needed on first use.<br>
<p>
(*) I know this rule came from various old systems and Unix variants in simpler times.  I use it as a rough example of a fairly generous allocation of swap space, not that I am advocating it on current systems.  My point is that even if swap is much bigger than RAM, that&#x27;s still less than an order of magnitude to overcome.<br>

Thanks for the correction.  So Fedora is now catching up to Android in this regard.<br>
<p>
I wonder whether for Android devices an old-fashioned task swapper might work better than demand paging, with an app that you&#x27;ve switched away from (and which does not run in the background) being swapped out to zram and swapped back in when you open it.<br>

      <p>Android effectively has that, by requiring all apps to be capable of writing their own state to storage and exiting while backgrounded. However, swap helps because it allows more processes to sit idle in memory, ready for an on-demand "instant" switch instead of a slightly slower restore from storage.

Yes, the fork-exec idiom is a longstanding pain point for conservative memory management.  If only posix_spawn() weren&#x27;t so kitchen-sink-looking compared with the classical elegance of separate fork and exec primitives.<br>
<p>
As for ordinary fork() where you won&#x27;t immediately exec() afterwards, that might not spoil things, as it&#x27;s only *writing* to user-space memory that can cause a copy-on-write fault, not reading it.  And a system call to read bytes from a file into some memory may as well reserve the physical space in advance, rather than allocating it only once data comes back from the disk.<br>

You&#x27;ve reached the limits of my knowledge.  Could you explain how writing from other threads would cause a copy-on-write page fault to happen when a page is *read* rather than when it is written?<br>

The fault wouldn&#x27;t occur on a read, that&#x27;s true, but even if the child process doesn&#x27;t write, the parent is still running with all its threads, which will likely write eventually, and those can then unexpectedly fault.<br>
<p>
So you&#x27;d have to not write in *both* the parent and the child until the child execs.<br>

The child and parent both become CoW, and fork() does not stop any other threads in the parent. These threads can very well keep on writing to the newly shared memory.<br>

      Ha, that's an interesting idea - <code>fork_nocow()</code>. Exist in the parent's address space until <code>exec()</code>.

<p>Hey, <code>clone(2)</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55429269/45583">already exists</a>! A trampoline to spill all your registers to memory and you're done. Except for having to be careful not to leak any memory, as the memory would leak in the parent too, it's probably a friendlier environment than using regular fork - all your threads are still there. Oh and locks, who knows what's going on with that.

<p>Oh and how does thread-local storage work? Can you move it between threads? Is it even common? Does it depends on the thread ID? Is it possible to fake the TID? I don't know

<p>Hmm and how do you know when you can free the stack you've just allocated for this new out-of-process-but-same-address-space thread you've just started? And I bet python and other runtime-y things are not going to be happy with two threads that think they're the same. Maybe block the parent until the child <code>exec</code> s? I'm going to wave my magic wand and proclaim that if you did this you could then share the same stack on both sides of this new <code>fork_nocow</code>. 

<p>Anyway, I had fun spending 15 minutes thinking about it.

      Oh I'm an idiot. <code>fork</code> has to return - of course you can't share a stack. Copying/COWing just the stack would mess up all those RAII and scope based resource cleanup things. More likely to work with a callback, but then you've thrown away the almost-compatibility with existing code that was the whole point.

<p>Still, fun.

Your fork_nocow() is probably closest to vfork(2), which is approximately the same as forking but without a new stack or any CoW. However vfork is only really useful for the child to immediately call exec().<br>

posix_spawn is a kitchen-sink because there is no way to create a suspended process, apply all necessary settings/syscalls to it and start it. Hence the need to communicate a lot of possible settings through a single system call.<br>

I think that might happen in the distant future when all storage is NVRAM. If your entire storage system *IS* RAM already, there would be no point in paging. The CPU would be handling it in hardware via level 3 or level 4 cache.<br>

<h1>configfd() and shifting bind mounts</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 10, 2020</br>
           </div>
The 5.2 kernel saw the addition of an extensive new API for the mounting
(and remounting) of filesystems; <a href="/Articles/759499/">this
article</a> covered an early version of that API.  Since then, work in this
area has mostly focused on enabling filesystems to support this API fully.
James Bottomley has taken a look at this API as part of the job of
redesigning his <a href="/Articles/718639/">shiftfs filesystem</a> and
found it to be incomplete.  What has followed is a significant set of
changes that promise to simplify the mount API â€” though it turns out that
"simple" is often in the eye of the beholder.
<p>
The mount API work replaces the existing, complex <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html">mount()</a></tt>
system call with a half-dozen or so new system calls.  An application would call
<tt>fsopen()</tt> to open a filesystem stored somewhere or
<tt>fspick()</tt> to open an already mounted filesystem.  Calls to
<tt>fsconfig()</tt> set various parameters related to the mount;
<tt>fsmount()</tt> is then called to mount a filesystem within the kernel
and <tt>move_mount()</tt> to attach the result to the filesystem hierarchy
somewhere.  There are a couple more calls to fill in other parts of the
interface as well.  The intent is for this set of system calls to be able to
replace <tt>mount()</tt> entirely with something that is more flexible,
capable, and maintainable.
<p>
Back in November, Bottomley <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1574295100.17153.25.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">discovered</a>
one significant gap with the new API: it is not possible to use it to set
up a read-only bind mount.  The problem is that bind mounts are 
special; they do not represent a filesystem directly.  Instead, they can be
thought of as a view of a filesystem that is mounted elsewhere.  There is
no superblock associated with a bind mount, which turns out to be a problem
where the new API is concerned, since <tt>fsconfig()</tt> is designed to
operate on superblocks.  An attempt to call <tt>fsconfig()</tt> on a bind
mount will end up modifying the original mount, which is almost certainly
not what the caller had in mind.  So there is no way to set the read-only
flag for a bind mount.
<p>
David Howells, the creator of the new mount API, <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/17268.1574323839@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">responded</a>
that what is needed is yet another system call, <tt>mount_setattr()</tt>,
which would change attributes of mounts.  That would work for the read-only
case, Bottomley <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1574348414.3277.6.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">said</a>,
but it falls down when it comes to more complex situations, such as his
proposed UID-shifting bind mount.  Instead, he <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1574352920.3277.18.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">said</a>,
the file-descriptor-based configuration mechanism provided by
<tt>fsconfig()</tt> is well suited to this job, but it needs to be made
more widely applicable.  He suggested that this
interface be made more generic so that it could be used in both situations
(and beyond).
<p>
He posted <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1574886778.21593.7.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">an
initial version</a> of this proposed interface in November, and has
recently come back with <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200104201432.27320-1-James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com/">an
updated version</a>.  It adds two new system calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int configfd_open(const char *name, unsigned int flags, unsigned int op);
    int configfd_action(int fd, unsigned int cmd, const char *key, void *value,
    			int aux);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>configfd_open()</tt> would open a new file descriptor
intended for the configuration of the subsystem identified by
<tt>name</tt>; the usual <tt>open()</tt> flags would appear in
<tt>flags</tt>, and <tt>op</tt> defines whether a new configuration
instance is to be created or an existing one modified.
<tt>configfd_action()</tt> would then be used to make changes to the
returned file descriptor.  The <tt>fsconfig()</tt> system call (along with
related parts like <tt>fsopen()</tt> and <tt>fspick()</tt>) is
reimplemented using the new calls.  Bottomley provides an example for
mounting a <tt>tmpfs</tt> filesystem:
<p>
<pre>
    fd = configfd_open("tmpfs", O_CLOEXEC, CONFIGFD_CMD_CREATE);
    configfd_action(fd, CONFIGFD_SET_INT, "mount_attrs", NULL,
		    MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV|MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC);
    configfd_action(fd, CONFIGFD_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0);
    configfd_action(fd, CONFIGFD_GET_FD, "mountfd", &amp;mfd, O_CLOEXEC);
    move_mount("", mfd, AT_FDCWD, "/mountpoint", MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>configfd_open()</tt> call creates a new <tt>tmpfs</tt> instance;
the first <tt>configfd_action()</tt> call is then used to set the
<tt>nodev</tt> and <tt>noexec</tt> mount flags on that instance.  The
filesystem mount is actually created with another
<tt>configfd_action()</tt> call, and the third such call is used to obtain
a file descriptor for the mount that can be used with <tt>move_mount()</tt>
to make the filesystem visible.
<p>
With that infrastructure in place, Bottomley is able to <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200104203946.27914-1-James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com/">reimplement
his shiftfs filesystem</a> as a type of bind mount.  A shifting bind mount
will apply a constant offset to user and group IDs before forwarding
operations to the underlying mount; this is useful to safely allow
true-root access to an on-disk filesystem from within a user namespace.
<p>
Only one developer, Christian Brauner, has responded to this patch series
so far; he <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200105162311.sufgft6kthetsz7q@wittgenstein/">doesn't
like it</a>.  It is an excessive collection of abstraction layers, he said,
and it creates another set of multiplexing system calls, a design approach
that is out of favor these days:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If they are ever going to be used outside of filesystem use-cases
	(which is doubtful) they will quickly rival prctl(), seccomp(), and
	ptrace(). That's not a great thing. Especially, since we recently
	(a few months ago with Linus chiming in too) had long discussions
	with the conclusion that multiplexing syscalls are discouraged,
	from a security and api design perspective.
</div>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, Bottomley <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1578508929.3260.61.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">disagreed</a>.
He argued that there is a common pattern that arises in kernel development:
a subsystem that is complicated to configure, but then relatively simple to
use.  Filesystem mounts are an example of this pattern; the setup is hard,
but then they can all be accessed through the same virtual filesystem
interfaces.  Cryptographic keys and storage devices were also mentioned.
It would be better, he said, to figure out a common way of interfacing with
these subsystems rather than inventing slightly different interfaces every
time.  The configuration file descriptor approach may be a good solution
for that common way, he said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I don't disagree that configuration multiplexors are a user space
	annoyance, but we put up with them because we get a simple and very
	generic API for the configured object.  Given that they're a
	necessary evil and a widespread pattern, I think examining the
	question of whether we could cover them all with a single API and
	what properties it should have is a useful one.
</div>
<p>
The conversation appears to have stalled out at this point.  It is hard to
guess how this disagreement will be resolved, but one thing is fairly
straightforward to point out: if the configfd approach is deemed
unacceptable for the kernel, then somebody needs to come up with a better
idea for how the problems addressed by configfd will be solved.  Thus far,
that better idea has not yet shown up on the mailing lists.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Because /dev or /dev/config/fs might not exist in your namespace.<br>

If you're binding a filesystem, though, I wonder why there isn't a way to change the fd you get from fsopen of the existing filesystem into a separate filesystem with separate options for "bind"?<br>

Not a problem for /proc<br>

And if it *is* a problem, the right approach isn't some random new twice on open(2), but a system call that retrieves a directory file descriptor for /dev/config or whatever, one that you could then use with openat --- <br>

Adding more things to /proc isn't a great idea (it's already full of lots of other crap that arguably shouldn't be there), and there are lots of problems with safely resolving paths in /proc. Any new kernel interfaces (*especially* ones that will be implemented through magic-links) should have a non-procfs counterpart.<br>

I like that idea, but rather than a directory file descriptor, which might cause issues if the filesystem is not in fact mounted anywhere, it might be better to have new open() flags or AT_ values that select specific magic filesystems --- e.g. procfs.<br>
<p>
As a solution to the "what if procfs isn't mounted?" problem, that seems far more elegant than the alternative of creating new syscall APIs for every single feature in procfs that someone might need to use without procfs mounted. (Same goes for other magic filesystems.)<br>

Why would it cause problems? The actual FD would refer to a magical internal non-rooted mount, e.g., like the one the kernel sets up for pipefs on boot.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; As a solution to the "what if procfs isn't mounted?" problem, that seems far more elegant than the alternative of creating new syscall APIs for every single feature in procfs that someone might need to use without procfs mounted</font><br>
<p>
Agreed. We don't need duplicate APIs. We just need some way to get a directory FD for /proc, /sys, whatever without going through the mount table.<br>

sysctl() was broken, it had only casual connection with /proc.<br>

Perhaps it would be better to add a new syscall like 'open_special(fs_type)' to open '/proc', '/sys', '/sys/fs/...' directories without them being mounted.<br>

New special FD arguments to "openat()" and friends should be sufficient, no need for a new syscall.<br>
Alternately, the new "mount" syscalls can give you a handle to /proc or /sys without actually mounting them.<br>
Alternately, just acknowledge that not mounting /dev, /proc and /sys is not supported and going to cause problems, and leave it at that.<br>

The new mount API (in particular fsopen(2)) could work for this.<br>
<p>
The problem is that there is a security issue with giving a program access to a /proc without any over-mounts if the /proc they already have access to has locked mounts on top of it (container runtimes use this technique to mask certain dangerous procfs files from containers). If we want to have a simple API that gives us a /proc handle, we'll need to make some kind of procfs2 (which has been suggested several times in the past) which removes all of the patently unsafe files so that untrusted programs can get access to all of it.<br>

Yeah, security is a problem.<br>
<p>
Probably at this point creating something like procfs2 and then mandating it would be the best approach. But then there's a question of what exactly is an "unsafe file"...<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; why there isn't a way to change the fd you get from fsopen of the existing filesystem into a separate filesystem with separate options for "bind"?</font><br>
<p>
Bind mounts can point to any file, even one that is not a mount point--or even one that isn't a directory.<br>
<p>
However, it does seem to me that passing an O_PATH file descriptor to fspick, plus a new flag for fspick that says "create a bind mount", would be a good API. The article hints that "fsconfig() is designed to work with superblocks" but it's not clear why.<br>

<p>
I did explain that problem in the original email: all the hooks for fsconfig actions are in sb-&gt;fs_type-&gt;init_fs_context() which the fs_context allocation uses.  Now it is possible to special case this for bind mounts, but you also have to special case fsmount and fsconfig/reconfigure.  By the time you've done all that, you've effectively got two separate paths through the same code, which isn't really such a good idea, which is why I asked the question "what would the generalisation of fsconfig look like".<br>

<p>
In something of a grab-bag session, Josef Bacik led a discussion about
various challenges that Linux kernel maintainers face, some of which lead to
burnout.  The session was originally
going to be led by Darrick Wong, but he was <a href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220426024331.GR17025@magnolia/">unable to come to LSFMM</a>, so
Bacik gathered some of Wong's concerns and combined them with his own in a
joint storage and filesystem session at the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM).  As part of the
discussion, Bacik presented
his view on what the role of a kernel maintainer should be, which seemed to
resonate with those present. 
</p>

<h4>Fuzzing and CVEs</h4>

<p>
He started by noting that some of the areas that Wong wanted to discuss had
already come up in other sessions, including the <a href="/Articles/896670/">difficulties in setting up
and running fstests</a> and the need for <a
href="/Articles/896523/">backports of fixes to multiple stable 
releases</a>.  One topic that had not come up, though, was the increasing
prevalence of people running fuzzers against filesystems, then filing for
CVEs on the resulting problems.  The CVE then triggers the kernel security
process, which limits the amount of time available to make a fix and also
limits which people can be involved in the investigation and bug-fixing process.
</p>

</a>

<p>
In Bacik's opinion, a fuzzed filesystem does not constitute a security bug;
"I know I'm probably a heretic for saying that".  Filesystems can only be
mounted by the root user, he said, but that is often countered with the
example of a USB drive; "turn off automount" is his answer for that.  In
any case, the problem Wong described is not one that he has personally
experienced, but he asked Ted Ts'o what he knew about it.
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Ts'o said that companies that want to sell their products into certain
markets, such as to the US government, have special requirements with
regard to fixing security problems.  There are various time frames on how
quickly the bugs must be fixed on production systems based on their severity
score.  If those are not met, 
then there is an auditing process where arguments like "we're not crazy
enough to let random
container people mount untrusted filesystems" can be made to explain why
the CVE does not apply.  But that involves describing the situation to a
government bureaucrat, which, unsurprisingly, security teams do not enjoy, he said.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that generally those types of bugs do not have a high
severity score because they are not remotely exploitable.  Chris Mason said
that he did not think the security@kernel.org team was opening CVEs for the
reports it receives; Ts'o agreed, but noted that the research labs that find
these bugs often have a financial incentive to open CVEs.
</p>

<p>
Luis Chamberlain
said that the process followed depends on the subsystem maintainer to a
large extent.  Some subsystems, such as networking, do not fix bugs behind
closed doors, while others do.  The problem, of course, is that public
fixes can lead to zero-day exploits until the fix is made and rolled out to
distributions and into production.  Ts'o said that it may also depend on the employer;
there may be pressure applied to a particular employee who happens to also
be the maintainer of a subsystem.  That is not directly "maintainer stress"
but is instead targeting an employee, he said.
</p>

<h4>Expectations</h4>

<p>
Bacik said that he wanted to discuss "what we expect from maintainers".
Traditionally, the expectation has been that they merge, write, test,
review, and backport patches; that is a lot of work for one person.  Many
maintainers have come up with ad hoc solutions to try to scale that back,
such as making sure that 
the developers for the subsystem are also reviewing patches.  Ensuring that
there are good testing setups is important to that effort as well.
</p>

<p>
He would like to ensure that maintainers are also actively working on
maintaining the community itself.  Linux developers are passionate about
the work that they do, but that passion sometimes leads to conflicts. "We
get a little short with each other", which is not a good thing to maintain
good working relationships, he said.
</p>

<p>
Getting together in the same room, for example at
LSFMM,  is helpful, but he would like to see more done to get
out ahead of these kinds of problems.  It would be great to resolve these
difficulties before they blow up and before they require getting together
at a conference to fix them.  A maintainer cannot follow all of the email
threads, Bacik said, but it is fairly easy to spot "the big stuff that may
be contentious".  In those cases, he would like to encourage maintainers to
either be a mediator, or find someone in the community who is good at
mediating, to try to help developers from getting "overly invested in the
code; in the end, this is just code".
</p>

<p>
The intent is to find a way to ensure that those who are butting heads do
it respectfully and in a way that will allow them to continue working
together.  If the maintainers could be "a little bit more proactive" about
keeping an eye on contentious discussions, it would help head off these
kinds of problems.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that he has been having weekly ext4 development meetings that
have been really helpful in reducing friction for filesystem development.
Wong attends those meetings, which allows them to informally
discuss things, maintainer to maintainer, that will ultimately need to be resolved on the
linux-fsdevel mailing list.  Jan Kara and other filesystem developers, who
bring other useful perspectives, 
attend as well.  Though Ts'o is
sure that no one needs more meetings, he does wonder if some kind of monthly or
quarterly gathering of developers could make a difference.
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner agreed with the idea of periodic meetings; he thought it would be "very
useful".  He has run into mailing-list conflicts along the way and said
that it is only "in very very rare circumstances" when a third party comes
along to calm things down on the list.  Bacik said 
that it is important to ensure "that a random person can pop into a
conversation" to ask the participants to calm down.  That is not
necessarily the case currently.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to suggest that Linus Torvalds (or some other individual)
should be the one to step in and calm things down, but depending on a
single person is not likely to work.  Sometimes people are not paying
attention at the right time; Bacik said he did not see the problems Brauner
was referring to until well after the fact.  Bacik wondered if people who
are involved in a conflict of that sort should put out a call for a
maintainer or other third party to step in and help calm things down.
</p>

<p>
There are two areas that he would like to see maintainers take more of a
lead in: conflict resolution and technical direction.  Sometimes there are
two developers who are disagreeing about the best way forward; "that's
where I really want maintainers to step up more" and point out the
direction that the project should take.  That will help prevent the
developers from continuing to butt heads and allow the project to progress.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that he agrees that the main goal should be conflict resolution,
but that is in an ideal world.  In his experience, a maintainer generally
picks up all of the tasks that the rest of the community is unwilling to
do.  Since no one steps up to do test engineering for ext4, for example, he
takes care of it
because it needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
He is also spending quite a bit of time in recruiting new people to the ext4 community
and in encouraging companies to staff positions for ext4 developers.
That includes "working with an unnamed cloud company, not my own" to try to
get some of its developers working on ext4 and, hopefully, to join that
weekly development call.  That is something he suggested other maintainers
consider doing; other subsystem developers can also help the maintainer with that effort, which
ultimately will help reduce burnout.  A big problem is that "we simply do
not have enough people on some of the filesystem teams", he said.
</p>

<p>
Bacik said that it is his goal to reduce the number of things that
maintainers are doing so that they can focus on the areas where their
experience and knowledge are needed.  Automation, especially in testing, is
a good way to reduce the burden for maintainers.  The important jobs for
maintainers, conflict resolution and technical direction, cannot be
automated; that is the piece that requires a human.
</p>

<h4>Moving faster</h4>

<p>
He concluded the session by saying that he would like to see the
development of Btrfs (and, by extension, other parts of the kernel) move more 
quickly than they do today.  In order for that to happen, though, there need to be
more and better tests that are being continuously run to detect when bugs
are introduced.  Testing and test engineering are the kinds of tasks that
can be handed off to more junior engineers, he said, though the bar for test quality
needs to be maintained.
</p>

<p>
In general, he said that he wants to foster an environment where things
move quickly, but mistakes will be made "and that's OK".  Developers need
to understand that they can make mistakes, those mistakes will be detected
early on, and the change will simply be reverted.  Then they can try again,
That philosophy can be applied to the tests and testing infrastructure, as well
as to new features for the kernel.

<p>
The root user does not have a crystal ball that tells them whether the filesystem they are about to mount will exploit their kernel. I can empathise with the grumpiness of being flooded with security nothingburgers by companies that run automated systems but this claim really is heresy to me.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 18, 2018</br>
           </div>
In April, LWN <a href="/Articles/752188/">looked at the new API</a> for
zero-copy reception of TCP data that had been merged into the net-next tree
for the 4.18 development cycle.  After that article was written, a couple
of issues came to the fore that required some changes to the API for this
feature.  Those changes have been made and merged; read on for the details.

<p>
This API is intended to make it possible to read data from a TCP connection
without the need to copy the data between the kernel and user space.  The
original version was based entirely on the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call;
once a socket had been marked for zero-copy reception, an <tt>mmap()</tt>
call would create a mapping containing the available data â€” in some
circumstances, anyway.  The application would use <tt>munmap()</tt> to
release that data once processing was complete; see the article linked
above for the details.
<p>
Two problems with this interface came to light after the feature had been
merged.  One was that this use of <tt>mmap()</tt> was somewhat strange; an
<tt>mmap()</tt> call does not normally have side effects like consuming
data from a socket.  The author of this patch (Eric Dumazet) <a
href="/ml/netdev/633a84fd-ef6a-91a1-e45a-86d44ab2b9ac@gmail.com/">was
comfortable</a> with that aspect of the interface, but he had a harder time
dealing with the locking problems that came with it.  Calling network-layer
operations from within <tt>mmap()</tt> inverts the normal locking order
around <tt>mmap_sem</tt>; there was no easy way to fix that without
separating the networking operations from the <tt>mmap()</tt> code.
<p>
So, in the version that (barring more surprises) will be merged for 4.18,
the call to <tt>mmap()</tt> just sets up a range of address space into
which data from the network can appear via zero-copy magic.  Actually
getting some data into that range requires a <tt>getsockopt()</tt> call
with the <tt>TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE</tt> operation.  This structure is passed
into that call:
<p>
<pre>
    struct tcp_zerocopy_receive {
	__u64 address;
	__u32 length;
	__u32 recv_skip_hint;
    };
</pre>
<p>
On entry to <tt>getsockopt()</tt>, the <tt>address</tt> field contains the
address of the special mapping created with <tt>mmap()</tt>, and
<tt>length</tt> is the number of bytes of data to be put into that mapping.
As before, <tt>address</tt> must be page-aligned (which will happen
naturally since it must also be the address returned from the
<tt>mmap()</tt> call), and <tt>length</tt> must be a multiple of the page
size.  On return, <tt>length</tt> will be set to the number of bytes
actually mapped into that range.  The data will remain mapped until either
the range is unmapped with <tt>munmap()</tt> or another
<tt>getsockopt()</tt> call replaces the data.
<p>
In the old interface, the <tt>mmap()</tt> call would fail if the available
data did not fill full pages or if there is pending urgent data.  The
new <tt>getsockopt()</tt> call will fail in the same way in those
circumstances, but with a
difference: the <tt>recv_skip_hint</tt> field of the
<tt>tcp_zerocopy_receive</tt> structure will be set to the amount of data
the application must consume with <tt>recv()</tt> before returning to the
zero-copy mode.  That should make it easier for applications to recover
when things don't go as planned.
<p>
The new interface should also perform better, especially in multi-threaded
applications, because it is no longer necessary to call <tt>mmap()</tt> for
each new batch of data.  The implementation can also avoid making some
higher-order allocations that were necessary with the old API.
<p>
The end result is an interface that is less surprising, easier to use, and
perhaps even faster for some use cases.  The whole episode is a clear
demonstration of the benefits of wider review of new features, especially
those that have user-space API components.  In this case, a number of the
ideas behind the new implementation <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/9ed6083f-d731-945c-dbcd-f977c5600b03@kernel.org/">came
from Andy Lutomirski</a>, who 
seemingly only became aware of the changes once they were discussed beyond
the netdev mailing list.  Having many eyes on the code really does make it
better in the end.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What seems frankly amazing for me is that such a change (even the latest one) could be implemented and written in stone in such a short period of time without a larger audience looking at it. I understand that too large an audience could just an exercise in bike shedding, but still. If we had a mechanism to implement test changes not subject to the ABI stability requirement would make experimenting a bit easier, but as this mechanism does not exist I would suggest to proceed more carefully.<br>
In particular what seems strange is the fact that (and I may be wrong on this) mmap has been knows to be quite slow (isn't this the reason why using mmap for cp never worked better than read/write?), and therefore the initial mechanism should have been spotted as suboptimal immediately....<br>

Since `mmap()` is used to open shared libraries, I certainly would hope that it is fast to setup the page mapping.<br>

You're missing that this thread isn't about a _design_ concern with the _new_ proposal, it's a _process_ concern regarding the _old_ proposal (which did call mmap() once per receive). Namely, "How did that proposal get so far along before someone noticed that issue?"<br>

mmap is not slow. munmap (specifically tearing down the TLBs on every CPU) is slow. You must not leave a TLB entry available to userspace when the kernel has reused the page for something else. There are various optimisations we've implemented and a few we haven't yet to speed this up, but fundamentally it's slow because you need to tell every CPU that this process has ever executed on that the mapping is no longer valid. So it gets slower on larger machines.<br>

getsockopt is an arcane function, and a strange choice for this purpose.  If names mean anything, it's meant to receive socket metadata, not data.  <br>
<p>
The logical function to extend, of course, is read(2).  If the buffer address came from mmap, the kernel can operate in zero-copy mode.  Only if the user refers to the mapped memory must the data be made visible in userspace.  <br>

That doesn't work. The data doesn't just arrive while a recv() is ongoing, no? So either the data needs to be buffered somewhere, or you need state that lasts longer than a recv().<br>

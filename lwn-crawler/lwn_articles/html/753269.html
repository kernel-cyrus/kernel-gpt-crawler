The memory-management subsystem is a central point that handles all of the
system's memory, so it is naturally subject to scalability problems as
systems grow larger.  Two sessions during the memory-management track of
the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit looked at
specific contention points: the zone locks and the <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
semaphore.
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h4>Zone-lock optimizations</h4>
<p>
Dave Hansen ran a brief session about optimizations for the zone lock as a
follow-on to the <a href="/Articles/753058/">LRU lock session</a> held on a
previous day.  The management of memory at the page level is handled by the
zone mechanism, which maintains a set of per-CPU lists of pages that can be
used to satisfy allocation requests; the zone lock serializes access to
those lists when the need arises.  In some workloads, the zone lock can
create a significant amount of contention.
<p>

When one of the per-CPU lists is exhausted, the memory-management code
moves a new batch of pages into it from the global list.  The question that Hansen
wanted to discuss was the number of pages that are pulled when this
happens; that number has been set to 31 for a long time.  Hardware has
evolved considerably since that value was arrived at; perhaps it's time for
a change?
<p>
He had the results of some tests run by Aaron Lu on a couple of relatively
large x86 machines.  Increasing the batch size to 53 yielded an 18%
microbenchmark performance increase on a four-socket system; the increase
on a two-socket system was about half that.  Making the batch size larger
yielded progressively smaller improvements, and by about 300 there was no
improvement at all.  So there does not appear to be a case for a huge
increase, but perhaps a modest increase makes sense?
<p>
Andrew Morton asked whether there were other workloads that would be hurt
by this change.  Hansen replied that the worst-case latency might increase, but
throughput would as well.  Michal Hocko suggested asking the networking
developers for their opinion, since they are highly sensitive to latency in
memory-allocation functions.  Hansen said that the latency could
conceivably improve due to the reduced contention on the zone lock.
<p>
If the default value is going to be changed, a new value must be picked.
There was some talk of trying to tune it automatically, but the tests did
not show a whole lot of variation between the systems, so autotuning is probably
not worth the effort.  Rik van Riel suggested writing an LWN article describing the
problem and asking users to test various batch sizes.  The session concluded
with the idea that the batch size should probably be approximately doubled,
but that more tests need to be run before the change goes upstream.
<p>
<h4>mmap_sem scalability with munmap()</h4>
<p>
Yang Shi returned to the front of the room to discuss a specific problem
with the often-criticized <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore.  When a process
calls <tt>munmap()</tt> to unmap a range of memory, <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is
held for the duration of the entire operation.  That can be a long time for
big mappings; he measured 18&nbsp;seconds when undoing a 320GB mapping.
Any other threads needing <tt>mmap_sem</tt> (to handle a page fault, for
example) will hang while this is happening.
<p>
As a way of dealing with this problem, Shi developed <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1521581486-99134-1-git-send-email-yang.shi@linux.alibaba.com/">a
patch series</a> changing the way <tt>munmap()</tt> operates.  Rather than
unmap the entire range at once, it splits the range into a number of
pieces, and unmaps each piece separately, dropping and reacquiring
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> after each.  That change increased page-fault performance
by 6-8%.  The improvement is not seen for all workloads, but performance
does not appear to degrade for any.  That patch did not get much discussion
in the room, though; instead, the developers wanted to consider alternative
solutions.
<p>
Jérôme Glisse suggested that only the top-level page tables (the page upper
directory — PUD — in particular) need to be unmapped while holding
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>; after that, unmapping could drop the lock and do the
rest of the work without.  That only works for ranges covering a full PUD entry,
though.  Hugh Dickins, instead, suggested marking the virtual memory areas
(VMAs) covering the range as being deleted, then dropping <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
to clean up the page-table mappings contained in those VMAs.
<p>
Hocko had a different variation on the two-phase idea.  An unmap operation
could acquire <tt>mmap_sem</tt> for read access, then call
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
with the <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt> to release the pages associated with the
mapping.  <tt>mmap_sem</tt> could then be upgraded to write access to
finish the rest of the cleanup.  There are some practical difficulties with
this approach, including the fact that there is no way to upgrade
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> in that way, and it would be hard to create one since a
thread can hold multiple read locks simultaneously.  One solution there
might be to just drop the lock entirely and retake it for write access.
<p>
One possible trouble point with this approach is that an application 
accessing the pages in a range that is being unmapped would see a behavior
change if this two-phase model were implemented.  It was generally agreed,
though, that this application, if it exists, is already playing with
undefined behavior in a buggy way, so there shouldn't be any real trouble
there.  Things wound down with Hocko suggesting that this change should be
done first, since it is a relatively simple approach to the problem; more
complex changes can be done if the easy optimization is not enough.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

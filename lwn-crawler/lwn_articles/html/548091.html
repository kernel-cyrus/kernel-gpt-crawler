           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
Daniel Phillips addressed the full LSFMM group to push a concept that he
calls "page 
forking."  It is a response to the <a href="/Articles/442355/">problems</a>
that led to the 
addition of "stable pages" to the kernel and the <a
href="/Articles/528031/">performance regressions</a>
that followed.  In short, page forking is a sort of copy-on-write mechanism
for pages that are currently being written back to persistent store; it is
used in the in-development Tux3 filesystem.
Should some process attempt to modify such a page while I/O is active, a
copy of the page will be made and the modification will happen in the
copy; the old copy remains until the writeback I/O is complete.  In this
way, no surprising data will be written to disk before its 
time.  There are, he said, "a few interesting details" to work out, but
it's not too hard.
<p>
The result, he said, is that the performance regressions associated with
stable pages are avoided.  Instead, the system is accelerated
significantly.  Meanwhile, the overhead of the technique when it's not in
use is nearly zero.
<p>
Page forking proved to be a bit of a hard sell in this crowd.  Ted Ts'o
expressed skepticism about the performance claims, for example.  Boaz
Harrosh pointed out that page forking would result in two pages in the
system with the same mapping and offset, breaking assumptions found in the
code now.  Daniel responded that this is an issue that would have to be
examined in each filesystem that switched over to the forking technique;
there is, he said, a "burden of analysis" that would need to be done.
<p>
There were also concerns about how well the technique would work with pages
that have been mapped into user space.  Whenever a page is written back,
the kernel would have to find every page table entry referring to it
and turn that entry read-only so that the copy-on-write semantics could be
enforced.  Memory-mapped pages are heavily used in Linux, so there could be 
a real performance cost there.  Daniel agreed that this issue was a
concern, but did not elaborate further.
<p>
Then came a rather detailed discussion about how to handle pages with
elevated reference counts â€” pages that have been faulted in by the kernel
with <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, for example.  A page with references may be
undergoing modification, there is no way to know.  Daniel said that, in
such situations, the Tux3 code simply waits for the outstanding operations
to complete.  But, it was pointed out, some operations can take a very long
time; waiting in this manner could cause unexpected stalls.  Direct I/O is
another operation that can raise interesting questions. It 
is possible for an application to start a direct write from one region of a
file to another, possibly overlapping part of the same file; how page
forking would work in such a situation is not entirely clear.
<p>
Dave Chinner asked about how the writeback path works, especially in regard to
interactions with the <tt>fsync()</tt> system call.  Calls to
<tt>fsync()</tt> use tags in the radix tree to track the pages that are to
be written back; an <tt>fsync()</tt> call  will not return to user space
until all of those pages 
have been successfully written.  Swapping a page out of the radix tree
would clear those 
tags, creating all kinds of confusion.  Fixing that would require
significant changes to the writeback code, but, Dave asserted, writeback
will not be rewritten just to add page forking.  Ted added that the current
writeback code may suck, "but there are reasons for it sucking that way"
that cannot be ignored.
<p>
Daniel stated that there will certainly be some costs to implementing page
forking, but there are benefits too.  Once the work is done, the affected
filesystems will be faster and cleaner.  Should we, he asked, stick with
stable pages knowing that they can hurt performance, or should we do
something similar that is, instead, a performance improvement? Ted
responded that much of this talk seems like handwaving in the absence of a
patch with updated writeback code.
<p>
There were also concerns about pages that are written to a second time
while the first 
I/O is outstanding.  Would such a page be forked a second time, with two
copies under I/O?  That could lead to serious problems, given that I/O
operations can be reordered in the block I/O subsystem.  If a newer page is
overwritten by an older copy, users are unlikely to be impressed.  Daniel,
when pressed, allowed that he did not have a solution to this particular
problem.
<p>
Ted asked what the next steps should be.  Daniel responded that he hoped
somebody in the room would pick up the idea and make it generic.  Ted
responded that he sensed serious doubts in the room about the sanity of the
idea.  He had no desire to pick it up himself, stating that he didn't
consider himself to be smart (or foolhardy) enough to rewrite the writeback
code.  And, at that point, the discussion wound down.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is, for better or for worse, already the case.  (This is a perennial cause of pain for me.)  x86 hardware, at least, has real dirty tracking, but the kernel doesn't use it; instead, it write protects every mapping of a page before writeback.  The gory details are in a function called page_mkclean.

Parts of this almost sound like it either a.) overlaps with or b.) would benefit greatly from something similar to Featherstitch.<br>

      <i>..."page forking" ... is a response to the problems that led to the addition of "stable pages" to the kernel and the performance regressions that followed.</i>
<br><br>
Almost. Actually, page forking is how Tux3 enforces strong ordering to make the write-rename pattern atomic, among other things. But we found that it also boosts performancem and as a bonus solves the same problem as stable pages solves. So it happened in that order.

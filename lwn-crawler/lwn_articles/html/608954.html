Performance regressions are some of the nastiest problems that can afflict
the Linux kernel.  Often they go unnoticed when they are introduced.  Some
time — often years — later, some large user attempts to upgrade to a new
kernel and notices that things have slowed down considerably.  By then, the
original problem (or series of problems) may be hard to track down.  For
this reason, performance regressions are a common Kernel Summit topic, and
2014 was no exception.  What might be exceptional is that, it would appear,
the kernel community is getting far better at avoiding the creation of new
performance problems.
<p>
Chris Mason started off the session by noting that, at his employer
(Facebook), Linux is used anywhere that it is faster than FreeBSD — which,
he said, is everywhere.  Facebook tends to keep its working sets in
RAM, so its workloads tend to be CPU-, memory-, or network-bound.
Performance is an important concern there, so the company maintains
extensive metrics of how its systems and applications are performing.
<p>
Most of the production systems at Facebook are currently running on
3.10-stable kernels with about 75 additional patches.  There are systems
running older kernels there, but the Facebook kernel group is slowly
forcing them to move to more recent systems, mostly through the simple
expedient of refusing to fix problems in older kernels.
<p>
When Facebook first moved to 3.10, its developers felt the usual concerns
about performance 
regressions.  As it turned out, this kernel had far fewer
problems than expected — but some problems still popped up.  There was one
10% performance regression in the

IPv6 stack, but somebody else had already fixed it upstream before Chris
was able to track it down.  Beyond that, there are some issues with CPU
frequency governors, which tend to choose lower-than-optimal frequencies
and create unwanted latencies.  So Facebook is currently using the
ACPI-based CPU frequency governor while trying to figure out how to get the
newer <tt>intel_pstate</tt> code to do the right thing.

Another problem is contention for the futex bucket lock, which has
increased in newer kernels.  Within Facebook, Chris has fixed this problem
by moving some significant work out of the critical section protected by
that lock.  Rik van Riel suggest that increasing the number of buckets can
also help.
<p>
So what happened when Chris tried running a Facebook workload on a 3.16
kernel?  The numbers, he said, were "really good."  The workload on that
kernel gets 2.5% more queries per second and shows 5% lower latency.  It
does, however, also use about 4.5% more time in the kernel.  That is
<i>after</i> applying Chris's futex bucket lock fix; otherwise more than
half of all the system time was spent contending for that lock and the
system was unusable.
<p>
Going back to the company-wide 3.10 migration, Chris repeated a point from
an earlier session: there have been zero regressions caused by patches from
the stable tree.  They have seen a few problems with the out-of-memory
killer locking up the machine when killing POSIX-threads-based programs;
that problem has been fixed upstream.  There is also a case where combining
direct and buffered I/O on a file can cause data corruption, leaving
zero-filled pages in the page cache.  Chris expressed surprise that
existing tests did not find this problem, especially since it's not even
caused by a race condition.  He plans to look at the xfstests suite to
figure out why this problem is not being caught.
<p>
But in general, he said, going to 3.10 was the easiest kernel move ever.
<p>
In a digression from the main topic, Arnd Bergmann asked about the
additional patches that Facebook applies to its kernel.  Chris responded
that one of the more significant ones speeds the task of getting a thread's
CPU usage by moving the relevant system calls into the VDSO area.  That
code, he said, should go upstream soon, but his forward port needs fixing
up first; he 
"will not admit to having worked on it" in its current state.  Another one
allows the memory management system to avoid zeroing pages in memory-mapped
regions during a page fault; he allowed as to how that one might be hard to
send upstream.  There is also a change to reduce the amount of IPv6 routing
table information exported via <tt>/proc</tt>.  The company runs its entire
internal network on IPv6, so that routing tables are very large; it seems
that Java programs have a tendency to query that information and slow
everything down.

Getting back to performance issues, Jan Kara, who is working on
stabilizing 3.12 for the SLES&nbsp;12 release, agreed that things have
gotten easier recently.  His biggest concern seemed to be changes in
behavior that benefit some workloads at the expense of others.  These
changes are not necessarily bad, unless, of course, you are one of the
people whose systems slow down.  He pointed to changes in the CFQ I/O
scheduler and the NUMA balancing work as examples of this kind of change. 
<p>
Andi Kleen asked why Chris thought that things were getting better.  After
all, the kernel process is certainly not slowing down.  James Bottomley
echoed that question, wondering why regressions are declining when we have
not even been tracking them for the last few years.  There appear to be a
few aspects to the answer, but the most significant factor seems to be easy
to identify: there is a lot more performance testing going on now than
there was in the past.  If a performance problem is introduced, it is far
more likely to be caught and fixed long before it finds its way into a
stable kernel release.
<p>
Chris added that both Red Hat and SUSE have recently gone through their
enterprise 
distribution stabilization cycles; the extra focus on fixing problems
certainly helped to stabilize things.  Mel Gorman added that a number of
hardware vendors have been introducing new hardware platforms.  They put a
lot of effort into making their systems go fast, but everybody benefited
from the work.  But that, he warned, might be a one-time boost that will
not always be present.
<p>
Chris closed the session by noting that 3.10, in the end, is the fastest
kernel ever run at Facebook.  The developers in the room, who have perhaps
grown used to being admonished over their tendency to introduce performance
regressions, can only have been cheered by that news.

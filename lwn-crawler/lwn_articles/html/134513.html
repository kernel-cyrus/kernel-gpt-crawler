<h1>Defending against fork bombs</h1>

Standard wisdom says that the proper defense against fork bomb attacks
(where a simple script forks children until the system chokes under the
load) is to use resource limits.  Put a cap on the number of processes
which can be created, and the problem goes away.  In reality it's not quite
so simple; the limit can be softened by logging in multiple times.  And, in
any case, some people feel that the system should not collapse when faced
with such an attack.  A Linux system, it is said, should not be so easy to
bring down in its default configuration.
<p>

The last defense against fork bombs is typically the out-of-memory (OOM)
killer.  As the system fills up with processes, it will eventually run out
of memory and, in its desperation, start looking for processes to kill.
The OOM killer has a set of heuristics which attempt to choose the "best"
process to kill.  These rules help the system to avoid (sometimes) killing
processes which are vital to the continued operation of the system.  They
are not particularly helpful in dealing with fork bombs, however.

<p>
Coywolf Qi Hunt has posted <a href="/Articles/134388/">a patch</a> which
tries to do a better job of defending against fork bombs in the OOM killer.
It works by 
extending the task structure to keep better track of a process's
"biological" parent and children.  These lists are maintained separately
from the regular process hierarchy pointers, and are not actually used
during normal system operation.  They are, in other words, pure overhead
most of the time.

<p>

Things change, however, when an out-of-memory situation hits.  When the OOM
killer starts up, it will select its first victim in the usual way.  When a
second process is chosen for an untimely death, however, the new lists come
into play.  For both the current and previous victim, the OOM killer will
traverse the "biological parent" pointers to create a path through the
process hierarchy.  Using those paths, the code can select the "least
common ancestor," the lowest process which is an ancestor to both victims.
Then, rather than killing the second chosen victim directly, the OOM killer
goes after the ancestor - and all of its children.  If the OOM situation
persists, the killer should be able to quickly work its way up the process
hierarchy until it finds (and eliminates) the process responsible for the
whole mess. 

<p>
Coywolf has a set of test cases and a system he is willing to run them on;
for all but the nastiest of the three, the patched system was able to put
an end to the fork bomb attack without any ill effects beyond a temporary
slowdown.  In the worst case, the system still recovered, but with some
collateral damage.  The patch adds some significant overhead (one pointer
and two <tt>list_head</tt> structures) to each process in the system, so it
may encounter some resistance - most systems will pay that overhead, but
never actually need to run the OOM killer.  But, for systems which are
exposed to that sort of attack, this patch could be a useful last line of
defense.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <I>Then, rather than killing the second chosen victim directly, the OOM killer goes after the ancestor - and all of its children.</I>
<P>
According to the pstree, the common ancestor of all my applications started from the window manager's toolbar (including applications started from xterms started from the toolbar) is the window manager itself. So if two of these applications manage to trigger the OOM killer, there is a chance that all of my running applications will be killed. I don't know the probability of this scenario (probably pretty low) but it still doesn't sound to be a good idea for a desktop. And what happens when the fork bomb daemonizes itself (i.e. it's direct ancestor will be the init process)? I don't think it's that hard to create a fork bomb like that...

      <i>And what happens when the fork bomb daemonizes itself (i.e. it's direct ancestor will be the init process)?</i><p>
I guess that's why "biological" parents need to be tracked.

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 23, 2008</br>
           </div>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/264521/">Last week's Kernel Page</a> may
have been filesystem-heavy, but there was still a big omission, in the form
of ext4.  But ext4, being the successor to ext3, may well be the filesystem
many of us are using a few years from now.  Things have been relatively
quiet on that front - at least, outside of the relevant mailing lists - but
the ext4 developers have not been idle.  Some of their work has now come to
the surface with Ted Ts'o's posting of the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/266191/">ext4 merge plans</a> for 2.6.25.
<p>

One of the changes going into ext4 is a lifting of the longstanding 4KB
block size limit.  That does not mean that just any block size works, though,
and this feature will benefit fewer people than one might think, for one
specific reason: the block size must still be no larger than the page size
on the host system.  So those of us running x86 systems with 4KB pages will
be stuck with 4KB blocks still.  And, on any system, the maximum block size
is now 64KB.
<p>

One amusing effect of this change is that the size of a directory entry can
now be as large as 64KB as well.  But the field which holds the size of
directory entries is only 16 bits wide.  So a special hack has been
employed to recognize 64KB directory entries and keep everything
consistent.
<p>

Some internal variables have overflow problems as well.  Block numbers are
stored as a signed, 32-bit quantity, and so are block group numbers.  That
limits the maximum size of a filesystem to a mere 256PB.  In 2.6.25, these values will
become unsigned long variables, eliminating that intolerably low limit.
Through some trickery, the inode field which stores the number of blocks
associated with a file will be expanded to 48&nbsp;bits, raising the
maximum size of an individual file to just under 2<sup>48</sup> 512-byte
blocks.  
<p>

The work does not stop there, though: another patch redefines that field
to mean the number of filesystem blocks (instead of 512-byte sectors) used
by the file.  This is a change which has to be handled carefully, since it
is an on-disk format change which could create trouble for people with
existing ext4 filesystems.  Everybody who is using ext4 should certainly be
doing so with the knowledge that it's a development filesystem and is only
suitable for storing files which are not valuable for more than about
30 minutes - Rawhide OpenOffice.org updates, say.  But it still would be
nice to not trash every existing ext4 filesystem out there.  So the
<tt>i_blocks</tt> field will continue, by default, to hold the number of
512-byte blocks.  But, if that field exceeds 32 bits and forces the use of
48-bit numbers, it is thereafter interpreted as filesystem blocks.  Since
no existing filesystems are yet using 48-bit numbers, this approach
successfully avoids breaking them.
<p>

Journal checksums are another feature arriving for 2.6.25.  If the system
crashes, the journal is used to recover any transactions which were
committed, but which did not actually make it to disk.  It sure would
be nice to know that the journal, as stored in the filesystem, is intact
before using it to make changes elsewhere.
The checksum enables the filesystem to ensure that the journal is good and
avoid (further) corrupting the filesystem if it is not.  An interesting
side benefit is that the checksum loosens the constraints on how the
journal is written to disk, since an incompletely-written journal will now
be detected; that should help to improve filesystem performance slightly.
<p>

Note that full data checksumming is still not on the agenda for ext4.  But
checksumming the journal is a good (if small) step in the right direction.
<p>

Another change is a VFS API change, in that it turns the <tt>i_version</tt>
field of the <tt>inode</tt> structure into an unsigned, 64-bit value on all
architectures.  This version number is incremented when the file is
changed, and it's stored (split into two fields) in the on-disk inode.
64-bit version numbers are required by NFSv4, which uses them to provide
the dreaded "stale file handle" error when things change.
<p>

There is a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> (<tt>EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE</tt>) which can be
used to explicitly request that the on-disk inode for a file be converted
to the ext4 format.
<p>

The ext4 filesystem is extent-based, and has been for some time.
"Extent-based" means that it tracks block allocations by extents (first
block, number of blocks) rather than storing pointers to each individual
block, as is done in ext3.  There are a number of performance benefits to
doing things this way, especially for larger files.  Those benefits
disappear, though, if a file's blocks cannot be grouped into the smallest
number of extents possible.  
<p>

One technique which greatly helps in optimizing block allocations for files
is to allocate them in relatively large groups, rather than individually.
In 2.6.25, ext4 will contain the multi-block allocator, which does exactly
that.  One might think that allocating a few blocks at a time would not be
that big of a change, but the multi-block allocator is by far the most
complex patch in the set.  A lot of effort and heuristics go into deciding
how many blocks to allocate, finding the optimal set of blocks, tracking
the allocation, recovering blocks which end up never being used, ensuring
that an application cannot read pre-allocated (but unwritten) blocks in
search of leaked secrets, etc.  It is quite a bit of code, but it is worth
the trouble; multi-block allocation will be enabled by default in 2.6.25.
<p>

As noted above, a number of these patches force changes to the on-disk data
structure.  According to Ted, though, these should be the last on-disk
changes for ext4.  There are some features which still will not have been
merged when 2.6.25 comes around - delayed allocation and online
defragmentation among them - but they should not require format changes.
So ext4 is getting closer to the point where it is considered ready for
production use.
<p>

It is <i>not</i> at that point yet, though, and people who use it are still
doing so at their own risk.  To help drive that point home, Ted has
proposed <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/266269/">a new mount flag</a>
(called <tt>test_fs</tt>) which communicates to the kernel the user's
understanding that they are about to mount a developmental filesystem and
will not go filing lawsuits if things go wrong.  In the absence of this
mount option, an ext4 filesystem will refuse to mount.  One might think
that child-proofing the filesystem in this way would not be necessary, but
some extra care in this area can only be a good thing.  Filesystem-related
surprises are rarely welcome.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

No, you're thinking of the generation number.

The intent is to use the i_version field as what the NFSv4 spec calls the "change attribute",
which is used by the client to revalidate cached data: the client can check that this value is
still the same as it was when it last looked at the file, saving it from having to re-read it.

Currently we're using the ctime for that purpose, but it's not actually guaranteed to change
every time the file changes (especially not on ext3, which has timestamps with only 1 second
resolution!).

Seems like a number that might be worth exporting to userspace some day too--other
applications could also benefit from a quick, reliable way to determine whether a file has
changed since the last time they looked at it.

(The generation number--the i_generation field of the inode--is what's used to ensure that NFS
filehandles stay distinct even when inode numbers are reused.)

      One of the important issues discussed last week was fsck times&mdash;how current filesystems (including ext3) require long fsck times, which with the new, large disks (terabyte disks, or disk arrays, are soon becoming household items).<p>
Are there no plans to address these issues in ext4?

      The metadata clustering proposal discussed last week would certainly be applicable to ext4.  See also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/265402/">Val Henson's e2fsck patch</a>, which I've not had a chance to look at yet.

      I'm not sure metadata clustering (and/or parallel fsck) will be sufficient to solve the fsck problems.  Metadata clustering is more of an issue for ext3 (which has per-block metadata) than for ext4 (which has extents), and parallel fsck only helps when metadata is split over several disks (e.g. RAID), but not with single huge disks.
<p>
I had hoped to see is something like (for example) Daniel Phillips' idea in <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/13/146">http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/13/146</a>: a small change in ext4 metadata format (adding a reverse mapping), which may allow fsck to operate on-the-fly and way faster than it is now.  This is (IMO) far more scalable than the other approaches, whose effects are at most linear.

fsck is seektime bound, so doing parallel fsck would at least throw more Io requests at the
harddisk, making it hopefully seek less on the whole. Or something like that.

It seems to me that parallelizing, without substantial locking (-&gt; 
serialization) or very clever design, is likely to *reduce* correlations 
between block requests and thus *increase* seeking substantially: and if 
you're adding enough locking to keep correlations between block requests, 
you can probably make the whole algorithm a serial one without much 
difficulty.

Certainly the naive implementations (e.g. multiple threads, one per block 
group) would hugely increase seeking. (There's lots of unavoidable 
serialization too: e.g. you can't carry out the passes all at once, or in 
a significantly different order.)

You just need enough threads.  If there are 1000 threads, you'll have about 1000 requests in the device's queue at any time, and one of them is bound to be near where the head is now.
<p>
I don't know much about fsck; maybe the work can't be done with enough threads to do better than today's single thread.

Yes, one of them will be in the right place: but the others will be all 
over the shop, and the device will have to satisfy those very soon as 
well, so as to free up space for more requests.

It seems to me that this is a quick route to death-by-seeking.

If space for requests is the issue, it doesn't matter which requests you satisfy -- they all return the same kind of space.  You can ignore the distant requests as long as you want
<p>
I thought you'd point out that the general purpose head scheduling algorithm stresses response time, so would satisfy those distant requests soon.  But fsck doesn't need response time, and should use a head scheduling algorithm that satisfies the near requests first regardless.  You can let 990 of those threads wallow while the disk cycles through requests from the 10 that happen to be working in the same region of the disk.
<p>
I would much rather see the device driver than the application doing head scheduling.  Only the device driver really knows the seek issues.

It's not just that the general-purpose head scheduling algorithm stresses 
response time: it's also that it has finite storage, so will *have* to 
satisfy even distant requests fairly fast if it's not to starve userspace 
of memory (at least, this is true with the volume of distant requests a 
naively-threaded fsck would generate).

Also, it doesn't `really know' the seek issues. The only circumstance in 
which it knows *any* more about seek issues than fsck is if you're fscking 
a device atop a dm or md device: and in both of those cases the simple 
rule of thumb `issue contiguous requests' will provide far more speedup 
than the block scheduler ever could wring out of a pile of non-contiguous 
requests.

The only thing that really knows the seek issues is the drive controller 
itself (which is possibly remote from the machine doing the fscking), and 
it *really* doesn't have much ability to accumulate large numbers of 
requests and answer them out of order.

The best approach for speed here remains `issue contiguous requests', 
which is of course interesting to balance with fsck memory consumption... 
of course Val knows all of this far better than do I, and now I look at 
the patch she's catered for this, with I/O parallelized such that 
individual block devices *don't* see heaps of seeks.

"One amusing effect of this change is that the size of a directory entry can now be as large
as 64KB as well. But the field which holds the size of directory entries is only 16 bits wide.
So a special hack has been employed to recognize 64KB directory entries and keep everything
consistent."

Huh?

      modulo 2<sup>16</sup>, 64K is equivalent to zero.

But, if that field exceeds 32 bits and forces the use of 48-bit numbers, it is thereafter
interpreted as filesystem blocks. Since no existing filesystems are yet using 48-bit numbers,
this approach successfully avoids breaking them.

Reading the patches I can find on LKML this description appears to be wrong.

Instead what's going on is...

* If the file is small enough for a 32-bit sector count, the old 32-bit field is used, the new
16-bit field is set to zero, and the EXT4_HUGE_FILE_FL inode flag is reset if present
* If the file is small enough for a 48-bit sector count, the old 32-bit and new 16-bit field
are used together to store it, and again the EXT4_HUGE_FILE_FL inode flag is reset if present
* If the file is bigger, the count is converted to a block count, stored using both the 32-bit
and 16-bit fields together and the EXT4_HUGE_FILE_FL inode flag is set, as well as a "huge
file" filesystem-wide compatibility flag.

This way of doing things ensures that no previous file could possibly be affected, because the
flag was created for this patch, and without that flag such a colossal file can't be stored on
ext4 at all. It also ensures that older versions of ext4 can't write to a filesystem
containing a huge file they don't understand, and that if they're used to mount the filesystem
read-only, they can't read the affected file (since otherwise they'd find it drastically short
of disk blocks).

One should pay attention how many i-nodes creates on its ext3 FS. By reducing i-nodes, fsck
time is reduced too. Anyway there is no possibility to reduce or increase number of i-nodes
without reformating FS so one must figure out how many i-nodes to create for own use and then
do backup/reformat/restore.

Ext4 will have an ability to know what i-nodes are not used so fsck should be fast even
zillions wasted space with unused i-nodes will be in place on your not-tuned-FS.

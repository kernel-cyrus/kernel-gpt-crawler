</div>
Some new kernel features are welcomed by the kernel development community,
while others are a rather harder sell.  It is fair to say that <a
href="/Articles/780703/">core scheduling</a>, which makes CPU scheduling
harder by placing constraints on which processes may run simultaneously in
a core, is of the latter variety.  Core scheduling was the topic of (at
least) three different sessions at the 2019 Linux Plumbers Conference.  One
of the most interesting outcomes, perhaps, is that there are use cases for
this feature beyond protection from side-channel attacks.
<p>
<h4>Current status</h4>
<p>
The discussion started in a refereed-track talk by Julien Desfossez and
Vineeth Remanan Pillai.  Desfossez began by noting that core scheduling
has been under development for about a year; its primary purpose is to make
simultaneous multi-threading (SMT, or "hyperthreading") secure in the face
of hardware vulnerabilities such as speculative-execution attacks.
An SMT core contains two or more CPUs (sometimes called "hardware threads")
that share a great deal of low-level hardware.  That sharing, which
includes a number of caches, makes SMT particularly vulnerable
to cache-based side-channel attacks.  For sites that are worried about such
attacks, the only practical alternative now is to turn SMT off, which can
have a significant performance impact for some workloads.  Core scheduling
was developed as a less drastic way to keep tasks that don't trust each
other from executing in the same core at the same time.
<p>
Pillai took over at this point, saying that core scheduling groups trusted
tasks on a core.  It treats the CPUs in an SMT core as a unit, finding
the highest-priority task on all sibling CPUs; that task will drive the

<a href="/Articles/799490/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/Defossez-Pillai-sm.jpg" alt="[Julien Desfossez,
Vineeth Remanan Pillai]"
title="Julien Desfossez, Vineeth Remanan Pillai" class="lthumb"></a>

scheduling decisions.  If another task can be found that is compatible with
the high-priority task, it will be able to run on a sibling CPU; otherwise,
that sibling will have to be forced idle.
<p>
The first implementation of core scheduling was specific to KVM; it would
only allow virtual CPU threads from the same virtual machine to share a
core.  It was then generalized, with the idea that administrators should be
able to define the policy that sets the trust boundaries.  The initial
prototype uses control groups; an administrator can mark tasks as
compatible by putting them in the same group, or setting the same value in
the <tt>cpu.tag</tt> variable in multiple groups.  The third version of the
patch set is under discussion now; it is focused mostly on bug fixes and
performance issues.
<p>
There are indeed a few of these issues.  The scheduler's <tt>vruntime</tt>
value is used to compare tasks when making scheduling decisions; that works
on a single CPU, but it was never intended to be used for cross-CPU
comparisons.  That can lead to starvation issues for some tasks.  Current
thinking is to treat these comparisons as more of a load-balancing issue,
perhaps along with the creation of a normalized or core-wide
<tt>vruntime</tt> value that will support more accurate comparisons.
<p>
The forced idling of sibling CPUs is a necessary evil in core scheduling,
but it's apparently even more evil than it really needs to be.  In particular, a
CPU-intensive process can cause a sibling to stay idle for a long time,
starving the process executing there of CPU time.  Somehow, the scheduler
must learn to account for the forced-idle time to be able to trigger
decisions (and switch to a starved task) at the right time.  An alternative
might be to create a special 
version of the idle task to run on a forced-idle CPU that can poke the
scheduler when it is time to make a change.
<p>
Desfossez returned to talk a bit about testing, which has been done
extensively for this patch set.  Performance-oriented patches always need
to demonstrate a clear benefit; in this case, it's far from clear that core
scheduling is always better than just turning off SMT.  The testing
infrastructure also uses tracing to verify correctness, ensuring that no
incompatible tasks ever run together.
<p>
Testing has revealed the fairness issues described above, and has shown
that turning off SMT is indeed better for some workloads.  In particular,
I/O-intensive workloads do not benefit from core scheduling; he mentioned a
MySQL benchmark that performs worse with it turned on.
<p>
Future work includes a rethinking of how process selection works.  There is
also the little problem that, while core scheduling protects processes from
each other, it does not protect the kernel against user space.  Fixing that
would require adding synchronization points on system calls and exit from
virtual machines, which is likely to be expensive.  There is probably no
other way to protect the kernel from <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/mds.html#mds">MDS</a>
attacks, though.  Finally, he said, the interface for identifying processes
needs to be rethought.
<p>
After the talk, Len Brown asked about how well the code would work on
systems that have more than two siblings in an SMT core.  Such systems do
not exist now, but one can imagine CPU designers are thinking about such
things.  The answer was that the code is generic and should be able to
handle that case, but it is hard to know for sure since there's no hardware
available to test it on.
<p>
<h4>Other uses</h4>
<p>
During the Scheduling Microconference, core scheduling was the topic of
another set of sessions that were less focused on implementation details
and more on 
other ways in which the feature might be used.  Subhra Mazumdar started by
describing a database use case from Oracle, which has its own
virtualization setup and would like to use core scheduling to spread tasks
optimally.  But using core scheduling now leads to a significant (17-30%)
performance decline, mostly as a result of the forced idling of CPUs.
Often, a CPU goes idle when it could be running a task from another core
elsewhere in the system.  Mazumdar suggested that the scheduler's wakeup
path needs to be changed to allow it to find a task with a matching tag
anywhere in the system.
<p>
In the discussion, it was repeated that core scheduling is unlikely to ever
be better for all workloads.  There were references, in particular, to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190425144619.GX18914@techsingularity.net/">these
benchmarks run by Mel Gorman</a>, showing that enabling SMT can result in worse
performance even in the absence of core scheduling.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/799512/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/AubreyLi-sm.jpg" alt="[Aubrey Li]"
title="Aubrey Li" class="lthumb"></a>

Aubrey Li got up to discuss a different sort of use case for core
scheduling: deep-learning training workloads.  This kind of workload tends
to use a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">AVX-512
instructions</a>, which can give significant performance benefits.  But
these instructions, as it turns out, can reduce the maximum CPU frequency
for the entire core; if an unrelated task is running elsewhere on the same
core, it may be adversely affected by the AVX-512 use.  Having two
AVX-512-using processes on the same core, though, is no worse than having
one there.
<p>
It thus makes sense to keep processes making heavy use of those
instructions together on the same core.  Core scheduling can do this;  his
workload gets a 10% improvement in 
throughput and a 30% reduction in latency with it enabled.  He thus
believes that there 
would be value in merging core scheduling into the mainline.
<p>
Jan Schönherr, instead, has a different sort of use case: isolating some
processes, while forcing others to run together.  His patch set,
confusingly (in this context) named <a
href="/Articles/764482/">coscheduling</a>, allows an administrator to set
policies that will force related processes to run on the same core while
excluding others.  The result should be the security benefits of core
scheduling, but also some performance benefits from having related tasks
share CPU resources.
<p>
He was asked whether the existing cpuset functionality could handle this
use case.  The answer was that it works well, but only until the system is
overcommitted.  Once the load gets too heavy everything breaks down, and
the simultaneous-execution property is lost.

<p>
<h4>Realtime</h4>
<p>
One day later, during the Realtime Microconference, Peter Zijlstra led yet
another session on core scheduling which, he said, is "all the rage these
days".  So many people want it that he's afraid there will be no
alternative to merging it, even though it is not a complete solution to the
side-channel problem.
<p>
It turns out that realtime developers have come to find the idea
attractive as well.  The problem, from the realtime point of view, is that
SMT is not deterministic, or as Zijlstra put it, it's "deterministically
awful".  Realtime users tend to disable it to avoid the latency problems

<a href="/Articles/799513/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/PeterZijlstra-sm.jpg" alt="[Peter Zijlstra]"
title="Peter Zijlstra" class="rthumb"></a>

that it creates.
But core scheduling can force sibling CPUs to go idle when a realtime
process is running on the core, thus preventing this kind of interference.
That opens the door to enabling SMT whenever a core has no realtime work,
but effectively disabling it when realtime constraints apply, getting the
best of both worlds.
<p>
Using core scheduling this way raises some interesting questions, though;
the one that was discussed during this session was the impact on the
admission control enforced by the deadline scheduler.  Admission control
prevents the scheduler from accepting a deadline task if the CPU resources
are not available to let that task meet its deadlines.  Forcing CPUs idle
affects the total amount of CPU time available; if admission control does
not take that into account, the system may take on more work than it can
handle.
<p>

One possible solution that was raised in the session is to multiply a
deadline process's worst-case execution time (essentially the amount of
time it is allowed to run) by the number of CPUs in a core, since that
process will, in effect, occupy all of those CPUs while it runs.  There are
a number of details to deal with, though, such as how to set the tag on
such a task; allowing it to be done in a control group or with
<tt>prctl()</tt> will be too late, potentially after the admission-control
decision has been made.  Perhaps <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html">sched_setattr()</a></tt>
could be enhanced for this purpose, but that would create two different
ways to tag tasks 
for core scheduling.  Zijlstra said that the developers would have to find
an interface that works for all of the use cases.


<p>
<h4>Getting it merged</h4>
<p>
Back in the Scheduler Microconference,
Pillai wrapped up the session by stating the core scheduling is a big win
for some use cases, and that it should be in the mainline kernel for those
who can benefit from it.  The feature will have to be turned off by
default, though, since it is not beneficial to everybody.  There is still
the little problem that core scheduling does not protect the kernel; Pillai
asserted that adding a security boundary on exit from virtual machines
would be sufficient there.  Providing isolation at system calls and
interrupts is not as important.  Thomas Gleixner disagreed strongly with
that claim, though, saying that entry into the kernel is the same
regardless of the mechanism used.
<p>
Paul Turner said that protection against hardware vulnerabilities is not
just a scheduling problem, and that core scheduling is insufficient
regardless.  Coscheduling will also prove necessary, he said, and probably
something like the ill-fated (so far) <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1562855138-19507-1-git-send-email-alexandre.chartre@oracle.com/">address-space
isolation patches</a> as well.  All of the pieces have to be looked at, and
developers need to find a way to assemble them all.  Gleixner agreed, but
said that there also needs to be an understanding of the picture as a whole
or the pieces will never fit.

Yes, and there's more, so I guess it doesn't surprise me that Linux doesn't do scheduling all that well.<br>
<p>
Don't the companies give their devs access to bigger systems? Small systems behavior is kinda easier to figure out without having to explicitly test for them, compared to (multi-level) NUMA and what not...<br>
<p>
With that MySQL example, I'm almost sure the total overall system throughput with many MySQL instances in containers/VMs will be much better with Core scheduling than with HT off; though it will almost certainly have a negative impact on just one single running instance. Kind of expected, isn't it?<br>
<p>
I am writing this knowing that this doesn't sound too respectful to the community that's been doing all the hard work just so that us admins can badmouth results of their hard work, but, it's equally hard for me not to remember the frustration I had every time I've seen Linux behave less than well on "bigger" (not all that big though, arguably) setups. It should say in every admin's 101 that eventually, you ought to became a developer or at least a minor contributor of the open systems you're running ;-)<br>
<p>
Needless to say, I really do appreciate the work; and I know it's not easy to factor in systems so different and apart from each other as a smart bulb and a virtualization/containerization node can be....<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There were references, in particular, to these benchmarks run by Mel Gorman, showing that enabling SMT can result in worse performance even in the absence of core scheduling.</font><br>

That's why these comparisons should always be "3 ways": 1. old and "unsafe" SMT, 2. newer and "safe" SMT, 3. no SMT.<br>

I mean what's the point of "oh noes, safe SMT is slower than no SMT!" in cases where unsafe SMT was already slower in the first place, even before becoming safe...<br>

You are right and all our tests are performed this way, different workloads behave differently in those 3 situations depending on various factors. We work to prove that core scheduling is a relevant alternative for a variety of use-cases. We know it won't be always be better than disabling SMT, just like enabling SMT is not always a performance improvement.<br>
<p>
The observation that disabling SMT is more efficient than having it enabled in some cases was a side effect from this testing.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; That opens the door to enabling SMT whenever a core has no realtime work, but effectively disabling it when realtime constraints apply, getting the best of both worlds.</font><br>
<p>
Hey, why wouldn't *any* workload (not just real time) be able to  dynamically request full cores and virtually disable SMT where and only where it's running because it knows better? I mean performance wise, even before looking at security<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Pillai wrapped up the session by stating the core scheduling is a big win for some use cases, and that it should be in the mainline kernel for those who can benefit from it. The feature will have to be turned off by default, though, since it is not beneficial to everybody.</font><br>
<p>
Does "off by default" mean "completely removed at Kconfig time" or "only for workloads that explicitly request it? (at run-time)".<br>
<p>
I have a feeling that I'm either suggesting something crazy, or that I totally missed it's already there...<br>

Even when core scheduling is built in the kernel, the default behavior is to not tag any task by default. The administrators are responsible for tagging the tasks because they know their performance/threat model. This tagging is what enables core scheduling at run-time, if no tasks are tagged the scheduler behavior is unchanged.<br>
<p>
Dynamically requesting a full core is indeed not a feature restricted to RT tasks, and the purpose can be performance and/or security.<br>

Merci Julien! So basically: "core scheduling == "generic, run-time SMT configuration"; sounds impressive indeed.<br>

So this what was also meant by:<br>

... right?<br>

Default compile-time configuration, default run-time configuration,... who cares about minor implementation details like this and what a nitpicker I am! ;-)<br>

Yes, "turned off by default" means at run-time there are no tags enabled by default, the feature remains inactive until a task in tagged.<br>
For the compile-time default configuration, it hasn't been discussed yet.<br>

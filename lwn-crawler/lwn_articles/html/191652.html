coverage</a> on LWN.net.
</td></tr></table>

As the complexity of the kernel grows, there is an increasing use of
"mini-summits" to talk about specific subsystems.  Each of these events
typically lasts two or three days - as long as the entire primary summit -
and covers its target area in far greater depth.  This session was an
opportunity for the organizers of recent mini-summits to discuss what was
accomplished.
<p>

Matthew Wilcox covered the storage summit, recently held in Vancouver.  The
presentation, unfortunately, was difficult to hear, so few details will be
recounted here.  <a
href="http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/storage-summit-2006/2006-June/000101.html">These
notes by Craig Thomas</a> have much more information about the summit.
<p>

Matthew mentioned the new block layer concept of "request groups," but
didn't get into what they actually do.  There was some discussion of how
I/O barriers and multipath I/O tend not to work well together - it is too
easy for operations to be reordered when they get to the device by
different paths.  There was some discussion of the difficulty of using
sysfs for non-trivial driver control operations; there is just no way to
perform a multi-parameter, transactional operation in the sysfs context.
There was also some talk about how a new SCSI maintainer might be chosen,
should James Bottomley hang up his bow tie and move on; there was agreement
among the vendors that having the SCSI maintainer employed by a competitor
would not be a problem.
<p>

There was a digression into the problem of certain CDROMs which will not
properly report the true length of a disk until the kernel attempts to read
past the end.  Currently, the result can be the loss of the last few (512-byte)
blocks on the disk.  There are feasible ways of working around the problem,
however, so a solution should not be long in coming.
<p>

John Linville discussed the wireless networking summit.  He suggested that
interested people read <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/179305/">LWN's
coverage of the summit</a> for the details from that event.  Since then, a
number of things have happened, including the merging of the zd1211 driver
for 2.6.18.
<p>

Work in integrating the Devicescape stack continues, but a few glitches
remain.  The stack is still not entirely SMP safe, a shortcoming which must
be fixed before Devicescape can be merged.  While this stack works well
with adaptors requiring software MAC support, it is less well suited to
smarter devices with hardware MAC controllers.  Meanwhile, participation
from Devicescape employees has fallen off sharply, and some driver
developers are concluding that this stack isn't quite as nice to work with
as they had originally thought.  Still, integration work continues, and
this stack should find its way into the mainline eventually.
<p>

The wireless extensions API took some grief during the discussion.  This
API has never been entirely popular (though it has achieved its goal of
unifying wireless device control for years), and the addition of the
netlink interface has seemingly just made things worse.  John points out,
however, that patches implementing alternative APIs have been in short
supply, and, until such a patch comes along, the wireless extensions will
not be going anywhere.
<p>

Open issues in the wireless networking area include quality of service support
- this topic was discussed in the Wireless Summit report, and has not
changed much since then.  There is also the problem of reverse engineering
of wireless hardware and just how careful the developers have to be to
avoid legal problems.  Some developers feel that the bar is being set too
high, but Alan Cox recounted the story of the Philips webcam driver and
asserted that extreme care remains necessary.  Getting into legal trouble
with the wrong company could lead to extensive problems for the kernel and
those who work with it.

<p>

Arjan Van de Ven talked briefly about the filesystems summit, noting that
disks are getting cheaper, bigger, slower, and less reliable.  For details,
however, he suggested reading <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/190222/">the
summary published by LWN</a>.  Arjan expressed an interest in getting
together with developers interested in working on a next-generation
filesystem with a five-year timeline, but this idea was not pursued further
here.
<p>

Hugh Dickins covered the memory management summit, held
immediately prior to the Kernel Summit.  There, the developers talked about
fancy new page replacement schemes like <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/147879/">CLOCK-Pro</a>.  For now, however,
there is more interest in fixing glitches with the current page replacement
code than in switching to something entirely new.  Some of the
infrastructure required by newer page replacement algorithms - dirty page
tracking in particular - can be useful in characterizing the performance of
the current code, however.
<p>

The shared page table patch was discussed.  As has been the case for some
years, this patch is still not quite ready for prime time.  Hugh noted that
RSS accounting remained an "extremely irritating" issue.  There are some
conflicts between shared page tables and efforts to make Linux more secure
- address space randomization, for example.  In the end, the case for
shared page tables still has not been fully made.
<p>

Dealing with memory fragmentation was a mini-summit topic, with
long-suffering Mel Gorman's work being sent back for another rewrite.
Write throttling is an ongoing problem; the current code throttles all
writers to a congested drive, rather than just going after the heavy
users.  The CFQ I/O scheduler helps with this problem, however.  The
out-of-memory handler needs work, as always, but memory management hackers
are "a bit ashamed" to be seen in the vicinity of that code.  Finally, huge
page support is an ongoing issue, with the right way of making huge pages
more robust still to be discovered.
<p>

The last update came from Len Brown, who discussed the power management
summit - also <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181888/">covered on
LWN</a>.  This gathering, he said, turned out to be more of an educational
session than a problem-solving exercise.  In a sense, there is not much
going on in the power management/ACPI area; the specification is not
changing, and Linux supports most of its features at this point.  The bulk
of the work is going into fixing bugs and making the code more solid.  To
that end, a test suite has been developed; it currently contains some 1700
tests for the AML interpreter.  This suite is expected to be released as
free software in the very near future.
<p>

Len gave a quick preview of his OLS talk on battery life.  He ran some
tests, and determined that Windows XP outperforms Linux with regard to
power consumption.  An idle laptop running XP runs down its battery in 290
minutes, while Linux only lasts 240 minutes.  For the laptop in question,
that means that Linux required 2.3 more watts of power to sit there doing
nothing.  There was also a large difference when playing back a DVD;
Windows, it seems, performs aggressive readahead so that it can power down
the drive, while Linux has no such capability.  Powering down USB devices
is also a problem - adding a USB mouse to an idle laptop takes 30 minutes
off the battery life.  In summary, there is a fair amount of low-hanging
fruit waiting for those who would like to improve power consumption on
Linux systems.

<h1>VMX virtualization runs afoul of split-lock detection</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 7, 2020</br>
           </div>
One of the many features merged for the 5.7 kernel is <a
href="/Articles/790464/">split-lock detection</a> for the x86 architecture.
This feature has encountered <a href="/Articles/806466/">a fair amount of
controversy</a> over the course of its development, with the result that
the time between its initial posting and appearance in a released kernel
will end up being over two years.  As it happens, there is another hurdle
for split-lock detection even after its merging into the mainline; this
feature threatens to create problems for a number of virtualization
solutions, and it's not clear what the solution would be.
<p>
To review quickly: a "split lock" occurs when a processor instruction locks
a range of memory that crosses a cache-line boundary.  Implementing such locks
requires locking the entire memory bus, with unpleasant effects on the
performance of the system as a whole.  Most architectures do not allow
split locks at all, but x86 does; only recently have some x86 processors gained
the ability to generate a trap when a split lock is requested.
<p>
Kernel developers are interested in enabling split-lock detection as a
way of eliminating a possible denial-of-service attack vector as well as
just getting rid of a performance problem that could be especially
problematic for latency-sensitive workloads.  In short, there is a desire
for x86 to be like other architectures in this regard.  The implementation
of this change has evolved considerably over time; in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6650cdd9a8cc">the
patch that was merged</a>, there is a new boot-time parameter
(<tt>split_lock_detect=</tt>) that can have one of three values.  Setting
it to <tt>off</tt> disables this feature, <tt>warn</tt> causes a warning to
be issued when user-space code executes a split lock, and <tt>fatal</tt>
causes a <tt>SIGBUS</tt> signal to be sent.  The default value is
<tt>warn</tt>.
<p>

The various discussions around split-lock detection included
virtualization, which has always raised some interesting questions.  A
system that runs virtualized guests is a logical place to enable split-lock
detection, since a guest can disrupt others with hostile locking behavior.
But a host that turns on split-lock detection risks breaking guests that
are unprepared for it; this problem extends to the guest operating system,
which will be directly exposed to the alignment-check traps caused by
split-lock detection.  It may not be possible for the administrator of
the host to even know whether the guest workloads are ready or not.  So
various kernel
developers wondered what the best policy regarding virtualization should
be.

<p>
It seems that some of that discussion fell by the wayside as the final
patch was being prepared, leading to an unpleasant surprise.  Kenneth
Crudup first reported that split-lock detection caused VMware guests to
crash, but the problem turns out to be a bit more widespread than that.
<p>
Intel's "virtual machine extensions" (VMX, also referred to as "VT-x")
implements hardware-supported virtualization on x86 processors.  A
<tt>VMLAUNCH</tt> instruction places the processor in the virtualized mode,
where the client's system software can (mostly) behave like it is running
on bare hardware
while being contained within its sandbox.  It turns out that, if split-lock
detection is enabled and code running within a virtual machine attempts a
split lock, the processor will happily deliver an alignment-check
trap to a thread running in the VMX mode; what happens next depends on the
hypervisor.  And most hypervisors are not prepared for this to happen; they
will often just forward the trap into the virtual machine, which, not being
prepared for it, will likely crash.  Any hypervisor using VMX is affected
by this issue.
<p>
Thomas Gleixner responded to the problem with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200402123258.895628824@linutronix.de/">a short
patch series</a> trying to cause the right things to happen.  One of the
affected hypervisors is KVM; since it is a part of the kernel, the right
solution is to just make KVM handle the trap properly.  Gleixner included
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200402124205.334622628@linutronix.de/">a
patch</a> causing KVM to check to see whether the machine was configured to
receive an alignment-check trap and only deliver it if so.  That patch is
likely to be superseded by <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200402155554.27705-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com/">a
different series</a> written by Xiaoyao Li, but the core idea (make KVM
handle the trap correctly) is uncontroversial.
<p>
The real question is what should be done the rest of the time.  All of the
other VMX-using hypervisors are out-of-tree, so they cannot be fixed
directly.  Gleixner's original patch was arguably uncharacteristic of his
usual approach to such things: it disabled split-lock detection globally if
a hypervisor module was loaded into the kernel.  But, since modules don't
come with a little label saying "this is a hypervisor", Gleixner's patch
would, instead, read through each module's executable code at load time in
search of a <tt>VMLAUNCH</tt> instruction.  Should such an instruction
exist, the module is deemed to be a hypervisor.  Unless a special flag
("<tt>sld_safe</tt>") is set in the module info area, the hypervisor will
be assumed to be unready for split-lock detection and the feature will be
turned off.
<p>
It is not at all clear that this approach will be adopted.  Among other
things, it turns out that not all VMX hypervisors include <tt>VMLAUNCH</tt>
instructions in their code.  As Gleixner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87o8s8l7t3.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">noted</a>
later in the discussion, VirtualBox doesn't directly contain <i>any</i> of
the VMX instructions; those are loaded separately by the VirtualBox module,
outside of the kernel's module-loading mechanism.  "<q>This 'design'
probably comes from the original virtualbox implementation which
circumvented GPL that way</q>", Gleixner observed.  Other modules use
<tt>VMXON</tt> rather than <tt>VMLAUNCH</tt>.
<p>
Eventually these sorts of problems could be worked around, but there is
another concern with this approach that was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200406122343.GA10683@infradead.org/">expressed</a>,
in typical style, by Christoph Hellwig:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is just crazy.  We have never cared about any out of tree module,
	why would we care here where it creates a real complexity.  Just
	fix KVM and ignore anything else.
</div>
<p>
There is a fair amount of sympathy for this approach in kernel-development
circles, but there is still a reluctance to ship something that is certain
to create unexpected failures for end users even if it is not seen as a
regression in the usual sense.  So a couple of other ideas
for how to respond to this problem have been circulating.
<p>
One of those is to continue scanning module code for instructions that
indicate hypervisor functionality.  But, rather than disabling split-lock
detection on the system as a whole, the kernel would simply refuse to load
the module.  There are concerns about the run-time cost of scanning through
module code, but developers like Peter Zijlstra also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200406144020.GP20730@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">see
an opportunity</a> to prevent the loading of modules that engage in other
sorts of unwelcome behavior, such as directly manipulating the CPU's
control registers.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200407110236.930134290@infradead.org/">A patch</a>
implementing such checks has subsequently been posted.
<p>
An alternative, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200406125010.GA29306@infradead.org/">suggested</a>
by Hellwig, is to find some other way to break the modules in question and
prevent them from being loaded.  Removing some exported symbols would be
one way to do that.  Zijlstra posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200406140403.GL20730@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">one
attempt</a> at "fixing" the problem that way; Hellwig has <a
href="http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git/shortlog/refs/heads/sanitize-vmalloc-api">a
complementary approach</a> as well.
<p>
As of this writing, it's not clear which approach will be taken; the final
5.7 kernel could be released with both of them, or some yet unseen third
technique.  Then, just maybe, the long story of x86 split-lock detection
will come to some sort of conclusion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What isn’t spelled out clearly anywhere is just how badly they screwed up the split cache line lock implementation. There isn’t one “memory bus” in a modern system, there are many cache coherent agents talking to one another and via home agents (contained within home nodes in Intel parlance) to external memory. There are so many nasty ways that you could implement “locking the bus”.<br>

Intel. This ought to be have been implemented using a TSX-like concept by putting both cache lines into effectively a write set consisting of lines exclusively held by a single core at a time, not by locking the uncore of the chip.<br>

Given how many problems they have had with TSX (which includes some so bad that they had to completely disable TSX on the affected processors in a microcode update), it's a good thing they didn't do it that way.<br>
<p>
It makes sense that they chose the simplest possible implementation: other than legacy MS-DOS era software, no software should do atomic operations on values which are not naturally aligned in memory. Their mistake was to take so long to implement a trap on these misaligned atomic operations.<br>

<p>
After a huge amount of effort to get TSX working for locks in glibc, actual benchmarking was done. TSX was only slightly faster than no-TSX, and algorithmic changes made no-TSX massively faster than TSX. Whoops. (TSX remains dead useful for attackers trying to trigger speculative attacks that then erase the evidence of their execution.)<br>

As someone who knows nothing about this, I have a question: does this essentially mean putting a disassembler in the kernel?  Because presumably that particular sequence of bytes that constitutes the opcode could appear in other contexts, right?  E.g. as initialized data, as the end of one instruction opcode followed by the beginning of another, etc.  Since x86 instructions are variable in length, is there a way to reliably determine this short of disassembling the entire thing from the beginning?<br>
<p>
Like I said, I know nothing about this, so this isn't meant as a commentary on whether it is a good solution or not, whether the benefits outweigh the costs, and so forth--I'm just teying to better understand what's going on.<br>

There's been a disassembler in the kernel for ages (or actually many, for many architectures: used e.g. for kprobes and uprobes etc to analyze function prologues to drop probe points there). This is just one of many users.

Not to mention the emulators... Yes, the kernel can, and does, have to emulate (a few instructions of) the running processor sometimes...<br>

How it has worked before with VMware Workstation: the product ships a ton of pre-built kernel modules, but these are invariably not for my distribution, and even if they were, they get old pretty fast, if you are tracking Linus releases. You can fall back on compiling from the provided module sources, but if your kernel is 6-12 months newer than your release of Workstation, this will usually fail and needs manual fixing.<br>
<p>
So… the module breaking regularly is par for the course, at least when considering VMware. <br>

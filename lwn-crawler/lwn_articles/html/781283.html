           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 5, 2019</br>
           </div>
Kernel code must often access data that is stored in user space.  Most of
the time, this access is uneventful, but it is not without its dangers and
cannot be done without exercising due care.  A couple of recent discussions
have made it clear that this care is not always being taken, and that not
all kernel developers fully understand how user-space access should be
performed.  The good news is that kernel developers are currently working
on a set of changes to make user-space access safer in the future.
<p>
<h4>User-space and kernel addresses</h4>
<p>
The kernel provides a whole set of functions that allow kernel-space code
to access user data.  Naturally, these functions have to handle all of the
possible things that might happen, including data that has been paged out
to disk or addresses that don't point to any valid data at all.  In the
latter case, functions like <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> will return
<tt>-EFAULT</tt>, which is usually then passed back to user space.  The
faulty application, which is certainly checking for error returns from
system calls, can then do the right thing.
<p>
Unpleasant things can happen, though, if the address passed in from user
space points to kernel data.  If the kernel actually dereferences those
addresses, it could allow an attacker to get at data that should be
protected.  The <tt>access_ok()</tt> function exists to prevent this from
happening, but it can't work if kernel developers forget to call it before
passing an address to low-level user-space access functions like
<tt>__copy_from_user()</tt> (the higher-level functions call
<tt>access_ok()</tt> internally).  This
particular omission has led to some severe vulnerabilities in the past.
<p>
This problem was, until recently, aggravated by the fact that, if an
attacker tried to 
exploit a missing-<tt>access_ok()</tt> vulnerability using a kernel-space
address that turned out to be 
invalid, the kernel would helpfully return <tt>-EFAULT</tt>.  That would
allow attackers to probe the kernel's address space at leisure until the
target data structures had been found.  Back in August 2018, Jann Horn
added <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9da3f2b7405">a check</a> to
catch this case and cause a kernel oops when it happens; attackers with
access to a missing-<tt>access_ok()</tt> vulnerability were deprived of the
ability to quietly dig around in kernel space, but there were some other,
unexpected consequences as well.
<p>
As <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190215174945.557218316@goodmis.org/">reported</a> by
Changbin Du, kernel probes ("kprobes") can be configured to access strings at
any address — in either user or kernel space.  The chances of such probes
seeing invalid addresses are relatively high and, after Horn's patch, they
would cause a kernel oops.  Linus Torvalds pulled the suggested fix, but <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgJzNp0R3cVhjBPHTR4X9sOvHdqK4UVFfbsOKQ6L=A_eQ@mail.gmail.com/">objected</a>
to the idea that a single function in kprobes (or anywhere else in the
kernel) could accept both user-space and kernel addresses and manage to
tell them apart.
<p>
On most architectures supported by Linux, it is <i>usually</i> relatively
easy to distinguish user-space addresses from kernel-space addresses; that
is because the two are confined to different parts of the overall address
space.  On 32-bit x86 systems, the default was for user space to own
addresses below <tt>0xc0000000</tt>, with the kernel owning everything
above that point.  Among other things, this layout improves performance by
avoiding the need to change page tables when switching between user and
kernel mode.  But there is nothing that requires the address space to be
laid out that way.  A classic example is the "4G:4G" mode for x86, which
gave the entire 32-bit address space to user space, then switched page
tables on entry into the kernel so that the kernel, too, had the full
address space.
<p>
When something like 4G:4G is in effect, the same address can be meaningful
in both user and kernel space, but will point to different data.  There
is, at that point, no way to reliably distinguish the two types of
addresses just by looking at them.  There are other environments where the
address spaces can overlap in this way, and defensive technologies like
<a href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> are pushing
even plain x86 systems in that 
direction.  As a result, any attempt to handle both user-space and kernel
addresses without knowing which they are is going to end in grief sooner or
later.  That explains why Torvalds became so unhappy at any attempt to do
so.
<p>
The solution for kprobes will be to require accesses to specify whether
they are meant for user space or kernel space.  To that end, Masami
Hiramatsu has been working on <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/155136974478.2968.3105123100519786079.stgit@devbox/">a
patch set</a> to add a new set of accessors for user-space data.  Once
those are added, and after some time has passed, it's likely that the
current accessors will be changed to work with kernel-space data only.
<p>
Kprobes are not the only place where addresses have been mixed up in this
way; it <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190222225103.o5rr5zr4fq77jdg4@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">turns
out</a> that BPF programs will call <tt>bpf_probe_read()</tt> with either
type of address and expect it to work.  Changing that, Alexei Starovoitov
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190222235618.dxewmv5dukltaoxl@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">said</a>,
could break existing user code.  Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whu_iwv4TQP5Xd62bTfWW-uswVecUbFeiSCuTWnH1xgPg@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>,
though, that: "<q>It appears that people haven't understood that kernel
and user addresses are distinct, and may have written programs that are
fundamentally buggy</q>".  He would like to see such uses start to fail
on the x86 architecture sometime soon so that users will fix their code
before something more unpleasant happens.
<p>
The solution here will be similar to what is being done with kprobes.  Two
new functions (with names like <tt>bpf_user_read()</tt> and
<tt>bpf_kernel_read()</tt>) will be introduced, and developers will be
strongly encouraged to convert their code over to them.  Eventually,
<tt>bpf_probe_read()</tt> will go away entirely.  But, as Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wiyFoHuK-EFgOxtepnvKNtzad2qeCTXz0gjRdbntEPoOQ@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>,
that will not be happening in the immediate future: "<q>It's really a
'long-term we really need to fix this', where the only question is how soon
'long-term' is</q>".
<p>
<h4>Keeping user space walled off</h4>
<p>
While the kernel must often access user space, unpleasant things can happen
when the kernel does so accidentally.  Many types of attacks depend on
getting the kernel to read data (or execute code) that is located in user
space and under the attacker's control.  To prevent such things from
happening, processor vendors have implemented features to prevent the
kernel from accessing user-space pages from random places.  Intel's
supervisor-mode access prevention (SMAP) and Arm's privileged access never
(PAN) mechanisms are examples of this type of feature; when this protection
is available, the kernel tries to make use of it.
<p>
This protection must, of course, be removed whenever the kernel 
legitimately needs to get at user-space memory.  For the most part, this is
handled 
within the user-space access functions themselves, but there are cases
where higher-level code may need to disable user-space access protection.
If nothing else, the instructions to enable and disable protection are
expensive, so code that performs a series of accesses can be sped up by
just disabling protection once for the entire series.  This is managed with
calls to functions like <tt>user_access_begin()</tt> and
<tt>user_access_end()</tt>.
<p>
The code that runs with user-space access protection disabled should be as
short as possible.  The more code that runs, the bigger the chance that it
could contain an exploitable bug.  But there is another hazard to be aware
of: a call to <tt>schedule()</tt> could result in another process taking
over the processor — with user-space access protection still disabled.
Once that happens, there is no knowing when protection could be enabled
again or how much buggy code might be executed in the meantime.
<p>
The desire to prevent this situation is why <tt>user_access_begin()</tt>
comes with a special rule: users should call no other
functions while user-space access prevention is disabled.  But, as Peter
Zijlstra noted, this rule is "<q>currently unenforced and (therefore
obviously) violated</q>".  That seems likely to change, though, as a
result of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190228145450.289603901@infradead.org/">his patch
set</a> enhancing the <tt>objtool</tt> utility with the ability to identify
(and complain about) function calls in these sections of code.  Functions
known to be safe to call can be specially marked; the functions that
perform user-space access are about the only obvious candidates for this
annotation.
<p>
Both of these cases show that user-space access is trickier and less well
understood than many developers expect.  A couple of long-time kernel
developers (at least) were surprised to learn that any particular address can be
valid (but mapped differently) in both kernel and user space.  It seems, though,
that at least some of these problems can be addressed with better APIs and
better tools.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's terribly easy to get this wrong. DTrace got it right from year zero in the early 2000s, with copyin() functions the user had to call explicitly to get data from userspace, because the SPARC has multiple architectural address spaces, and Solaris used them as you'd expect to separate userspace and kernelspace. But because for a long time x86 used only one address space... things regressed in the Linux x86 port, and it was only when I upgraded to a server with SMAP that things started failing anywhere I could see so I had a chance to fix it and put in appropriate SMAP-disabling instructions in the right places.<br>
<p>
The real problem isn't that these accessors are needed -- it's that so many arches have no way to make the lack of them obvious. There should always be a way, even an expensive way that nobody would ever run when not debugging, to have your tests explode if this sort of thing isn't being dealt with right. But right now it's down to finding hardware that has the feature, and that's tricky when it's hard to even figure out before you buy a machine whether it has SMAP or not: x86 is improving, but even today there are x86 CPUs on sale that don't have SMAP :( and most of the installed base doesn't, no doubt including most of the installed base of developers trying to work with stuff like this.<br>

Those of us who are <i>really</i> long-term developers expect this thanks to our experience with 16-bit machines.  On a PDP-11/45 running Unix, there was no way that kernel and userspace could have shared a 64KB address space.

<p>
They actually did. This is where `setbrk` came from, as it described where your program ended, and where the kernel started.<br>
<p>
It should also be noted that there was no memory protection, so when tasks were switched, the whole "userland" address space (south of setbrk) was written to disk, and another chunk of memory was loaded and jumped too. <br>
<p>
IBM's System360  was the first computer to do virtual memory in hardware. <br>

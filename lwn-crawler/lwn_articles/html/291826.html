           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 29, 2008</br>
           </div>
One of the biggest problems in kernel development is dealing with
concurrency.  In a system where more than one thing can be happening at
once, one must always take care to keep multiple threads of control from
interfering with each other and corrupting the system as a whole.  In the
same way that two roads become more dangerous when they intersect,
connecting two or more processors to the same memory greatly increases
their potential for the creation of mayhem.
<p>
Travelers to the US are often amused (or irritated) by the often-favored
solution to roadway concurrency: putting in traffic lights.  Such a light
will indeed (if observed) eliminate the potential for a number of
unpleasant race conditions within intersections, but at a performance cost:
traffic going through the intersection must often stop and wait.  This
solution also scales poorly; as more roads (or lanes with different
destinations) feed into the same intersection, each of them experiences
more red-light time.
<p>

In kernel programming, the first tool for controlling concurrency - locks
in various forms - are directly analogous to traffic lights.  It is not
coincidental that the name for a common locking primitive (semaphore)
matches the name for a traffic light (semaforo) in a number of
Latin-derived languages.  Locks enforce exclusive access to a kernel
resource in the same way that a traffic light enforces exclusive access to
an intersection, and with many of the same costs.  When too many processors
end up waiting at the same lock, the performance of the system as a whole
can suffer significantly.
<p>

There are two common approaches to mitigating scalability problems with
locks.  For many years after the 2.0 kernel came out, these problems were
addressed through the creation of more locks, each controlling a smaller
resource.  Lock proliferation is effective, in that it reduces the chance
that two processors will be trying to acquire the same lock at the same
time.  Since it works so well,  this approach has led to the creation of
thousands of locks in the Linux kernel.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>

Proliferation has its limits, though.  Adding locks increases complexity;
in particular, with more locks, the chances of creating occasional deadlock
situations increase.  Deadlocks can be avoided through the careful
observation of rules on the acquisition of locks, and the order in which
they are acquired in particular.  But nobody will ever be able to sort out
- and document - the proper relative locking order for thousands of locks.
So kernel developers must make do with rules for some of the most important
locks and the vigilance of the lockdep tool to find any remaining problems.
<p>

The other problem with lock proliferation is harder to get around, though.
The acquisition of a lock requires writing a value to a location in shared
memory.  As each processor acquires a lock, it must change that value,
which causes that processor to acquire exclusive access to the cache line
holding the lock variable.  The cache lines for heavily-used locks will fly
around the system in a way that badly hurts performance, even if no
processor ever has to wait for another to release the lock.  Adding more
locks will not fix this problem; instead, it will just create more bouncing
cache lines and make things worse.
<p>

So, as the number of processors grows, the path to continued scalability
must not include the wholesale creation of new locks; indeed, it requires
the removal of locks in the most performance-critical paths.  And that is
what this whole long-winded introduction leads up to: the 2.6.27 kernel
will include some changes by Nick Piggin which implement lockless operation in some
important parts of the virtual memory subsystem.  And those, in turn, will
lead to faster operation on multiprocessor systems.
<p>

The first of these changes is a new function for obtaining direct access to
user-space pages from the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
	int get_user_pages_fast(unsigned long start, int nr_pages, int write,
			        struct page **pages);
</pre>
<p>
This function works much like <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, but, in exchange
for some limits on its operation, it is able to do its job without
acquiring the mmap semaphore; that, in turn, can lead to a 10% performance
boost on "a threaded database workload."  The details of how this function
works were <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/275808/">covered here last
March</a> (though the function was called <tt>fast_gup()</tt> back then),
so we'll not repeat that discussion here.
<p>
The other big change is a set of patches which Nick has been carrying for
quite some time: the lockless page cache.  The page cache holds in-memory
copies of pages from files on disk; its purpose is to improve performance
by minimizing disk I/O.  Looking up pages in the page cache is a common
activity; it happens as a result of file I/O, page faults, and more.  So it
needs to be fast.  In 2.6.26 kernels, each mapping (each connection between
the page cache and a specific file in a filesystem somewhere) has its own
lock.  So processors will not normally contend for the locks unless they
are operating on the same file.  But locks for commonly-accessed files
(shared libraries, for example) are likely to be frequently bounced between
processors.
<p>
Most page cache operations are lookups - read-only operations which make no
changes.  In the lookup operation, the lock protects a few aspects of the
task, including:
<p>
<ol>
<li> A given page within the mapping must be looked up in the mapping's
     <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/175432/">radix tree</a> to find its
     location in memory (if any).
<p>
<li> If the page is resident in the page cache, it must have its reference 
     count increased so that it will not be evicted before the code
     performing the lookup has done whatever it needs to do.
</ol>
<p>
The radix tree, itself, is a complicated data structure; it must be
protected from modification while the lookup is being performed.  For
certain, performance-critical parts of the radix-tree code, that protection
is done through (1)&nbsp;some rules on what can be called when, and
(2)&nbsp;the use of read-copy-update (RCU).  As a result, the radix tree
lookup can be done in a lockless manner.
<p>
There is still a problem, though: a given page may be evicted from the page
cache (or simply moved) between steps (1) and (2) above.  Should that
happen, the second step will increment the reference count for a page which
now belongs to a different mapping, and return an incorrect pointer.  The
kernel developers have, through lots of experience over many years, learned
that system crashes resulting from data corruption are quite hard on
throughput.  So true scalability requires that this kind of scenario be
avoided; thus the mapping semaphore, which prevents page cache changes from
being made until the reference count has been properly updated.
<p>
Nick made an interesting observation here: it actually doesn't matter if
the wrong reference count gets incremented as long as one ensures that the
specific page mapping is still valid afterward.  The result is a new,
low-level page cache function:
<p>
<pre>
    int page_cache_get_speculative(struct page *page);
</pre>
<p>
If the given <tt>page</tt> has a reference count of zero, then the page has
been removed from the page cache; in that case this function return zero
and the reference count will not be changed.  If the reference count is
non-zero, though, it will be increased and a non-zero value will be
returned. 
<p>
Incrementing a page's reference count will prevent that page from being
evicted or moved until the count goes back to zero.  So kernel code which
has incremented a specific page's reference count will thereby ensure that the page
stays in its current state.  In the page cache case, the code can obtain a
speculative reference to a page found in a mapping's radix tree.  But it
does not, yet, know whether it actually got a reference to the page it was
looking for - something may have happened between the radix tree lookup and
the obtaining of the reference.  So it must check - after the reference has
been acquired - to be sure that it has the right page.  If not, it releases
the reference and tries again.  Eventually it will either pin down the right page
or verify that the relevant part of the file is not resident in memory.
<p>
Lockless operation forces a bit more care on the part of the page reclaim
code, which is trying to get a page's reference count down to zero so that
it can remove the page.  Since there is no locking around the reference
count now, the reclaim code must set it to zero while checking, in an
atomic manner, that nobody else has incremented it.  That is the purpose
of the <tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt> function, which will only perform the
operation if it does not collide with another processor.  Since
<tt>page_cache_get_speculative()</tt> will not increment the reference
count if it is zero, the reclaim code knows that, by getting that count to
zero, it now has exclusive control of the page.

<p>
The end result of all this is that a set of locking operations has been
removed from the core of the page cache, improving the scalability of that
code.  There is, of course, a cost, in the form of trickier code with a
more complex set of rules which must be followed.  Chances are that we will
see more of this kind of code, though, as the number of processors in our
systems increases.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Do these changes have a measurable speed gain with practical workloads on dual-core or
quad-core processors? The only benchmark I found was a synthetic benchmark from April 2006 by
Jens Axboe. The patch has probably been turned inside out since then.

I would be surprised if there was anything too noticeable for desktop types of workloads,
however 
the nice thing about these patches is that they actually speed up single threaded performance
as 
well as improve scalability.

Here is my justification to have them merged, which includes some numbers:
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/285339/">http://lwn.net/Articles/285339/</a>

For server workloads using threads and direct IO, there should be some improvement at even 2
or 4 
cores. The OLTP database workload that gained nearly 10% throughput was run on a 2s/8c system,

so a 4 core system should see a few %.

Yes.  Lockless is quite simple in theory but gets really difficult in the real world (say,
where ring buffers actually wrap).  You thought threading was hard to prove correct, debug,
and maintain?  Lockless is harder in every way.

I converted a small event-based networking app I wrote two years ago to use lockless lists.
It was fun but ultimately a waste of time...  It didn't run much faster but now it contained
subtle boundary conditions that, when violated by an unwary programmer, resulted in occasional
corruptions under load.  Good luck trying to debug that (don't bother stepping through it in
gdb)!

There are a few areas where lockless really is worth it, especially when you have a hot,
high-contention buffer or stack.  But be prepared for some tough maintenance.

technique, and are definitely very very complex and difficult to understand.  However, in
certain specific cases, lock-free can be simple, elegant, and a huge performance advantage
over traditional approaches.</i>

      Val's comment is directed at <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_synchronization">lock-free synchronization</A>, which is a very different animal than lockless algorithms.
The RCU implementation described in this article is lockless, but not lock-free: although RCU has deterministic read-side primitives, its updates can block via <tt>call_rcu()</tt> and <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt>.
In some cases, the fact that RCU's updates do block keeps things (relatively) simple.
<P>
We are still learning how best to use RCU to obtain good performance and scalability while keeping things (again, relatively) simple.  For that matter, we are also still learning when <i>not</i> to use RCU.  RCU is quite specialized, so is not always the right tool for the job, much though I might wish it otherwise.  ;-)

Can you please explain the difference between lock-free and lockless? That's a complex topic, and I can't find anything on that... e-mail me a link if you have a good reference please: gafunchal AT gmail DOT com<br>

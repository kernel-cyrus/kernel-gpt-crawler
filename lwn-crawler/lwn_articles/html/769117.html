<a href="/Articles/769260/">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
The 2018 Kernel Maintainers Summit convened in Edinburgh, UK on
October&nbsp;22 with a number of things to discuss, but the top subject on
most minds was <a href="/Articles/765108/">the recently (and hastily)
adopted code of conduct</a>.  Linus
Torvalds made his reentry into the kernel community with a discussion of
how we got to the current state of affairs, and the assembled maintainers
had a relatively good-natured discussion on how this situation came about
and where things can be expected to go from here.
<p>
Torvalds started by noting that the conduct issue is not a new one; it has
been "festering in the community" for years.  The immediate cause of his
decision to take a break and bring in the code of conduct was knowledge
that <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside">The
New Yorker article</a> was coming; he noted that, contrary to what was
written there, the author never tried to contact him.  That article led
to a number of discussions with friends and others; Torvalds concluded
that the best way to
"head things off" was to announce some changes with <a
href="/Articles/764901/">the 4.19-rc4 release</a>.
He acknowledged that this was done in private and it was rushed; it did not
follow the usual open-source model.  After the fact, he admitted to not
being sure that
the article justified all of the heartache that preceded it.  But, as James
Bottomley noted, the -rc4 announcement and adoption of the code of conduct
did cause the article to be rewritten.
<p>
The task of writing that announcement was not fun, Torvalds added, but
contrary to some speculation on the net, he did write it all himself.  He
suggested that anybody who needs to write a message of that nature take a
few days to think about it.
<p>
Whether or not the article justified the trouble, he became convinced that
he had taken the right course after about a week of reading the "vile
garbage" that came from people who were opposed to it.  He even saved a
couple of particularly special emails that were sent to him; they dispelled any
doubts that he was on the right side.  From here, he only had a couple of
suggestions.  While he agrees with <a href="/Articles/769056/">the addition
of the interpretation
document</a> and the changes to the code itself, now would be a good time to
stop making changes and just let things be.  There are a lot of people
worried about hypothetical situations, but we shouldn't make more changes
unless and until something happens.
<p>
Steve Rostedt interjected that the code of conduct is not "our code" and
that it 
would be better to move to something that better reflects our community.
Torvalds concurred that a lot of people do not necessarily agree with the
author of the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor
Covenant</a>, upon which the kernel's code is based, but that agreement is
not necessary; 
the code itself is good, he said, and we should resist the temptation to mess
with it further.  There
should be no more hidden emails about it; nobody is entirely happy with
it, but we can live with it.  Greg Kroah-Hartman added that many other
projects have used it; adopting it is like picking a well-known license
rather than writing a new one.
<p>
Torvalds went on to say that, as far as he is concerned, if the code of
conduct ever triggers, it will indicate a big problem; he does not want the
code to be an ongoing issue in the community.  To that end, he asked the
assembled group
to watch his emails and let him know if things start to get close to the
edge.  He has, in fact, installed a profanity filter on his outgoing mail,
but it is easy to be impolite without cursing.  Kroah-Hartman noted that
the previous "code of conflict" had been around for several years; it only
generated three reports ever, none of which had any real substance.  The
community has a good history of doing sane things in this area; we also
have a professional mediator, funded by the Linux Foundation, to help in
that regard.  Contact information for the mediator can be found in the
interpretation document.
<p>
Kees Cook said that conversations between kernel developers can be scary,
especially to relatively new members of the community who see them from
the outside.  Having the code of conduct tells these people that there is
somebody they can talk to if the need arises.  Bottomley added that
adopting the code will help to convince the outside world that the
community has gotten better.  Cook noted that, "two rants ago", Torvalds
apologized to him afterward, and the last one was a joke, so things were
already getting better.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that many of these interactions are context-dependent.  Ten
years ago, an effort was made to encourage Japanese developers in
particular; part of that was sensitizing developers in the community that,
in some cultures, direct criticism can lead to strong feelings of shame.
Once people know about issues like that, he said, they tend to be more
careful.  On the other hand, Christoph Hellwig said that the "I love your
patch" message from the 0day robot (which reports problems with patches)
was offensive to many in a different way.
<p>
The documents associated with the code of conduct, Ts'o said, should not be
seen as an absolute declaration of how things will be; instead, they are a
symbol describing what we are aiming for.  Grant Likely added that 
the community has not really changed much, but now we have thought about what
to do when things go bad and have a way to deal with such situations.
Laura Abbott added that having the code will help new developers feel that
the welcome they get at the beginning will continue to be there as they
grow into the community.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra admonished, though, that if a developer continually ignores
his feedback, he'll eventually stop being nice.  Others responded that it
is OK to say that the code is wrong, but one can't call the developer an
idiot.  But what is to be done when the person, who is ignoring feedback,
is the real problem?  It is still not acceptable to attack the person, Dirk
Hohndel said.  Instead, in the worst cases, the only real alternative may
be to simply ignore the patches.
<p>
Ted Ts'o wondered about difficult cases like <a
href="/Articles/761939/">the current effort to get the 
WireGuard patches merged</a>.  There is no real misbehavior happening there, it
is just friction between developers.  One of the reasons he started the
Kernel Summit in the first place was to get kernel developers to meet each
other; it's much harder to get mad at somebody you've shared a beer with.
Arranging such meetings is harder now, since the community is so much
bigger.  In response, we all have to work harder to assume good faith on
the part of other developers.
<p>
There was a fair amount of discussion on how it might be possible to get
more new developers to conferences.  The invitation that developers would
receive to the older, larger Kernel Summit turn out to be important at a
lot of companies, so it may be worthwhile finding a way to revive them.
There is a lot of thought that needs to go into conferences in general,
though; there are far too many conferences, so it has become difficult for
aspiring developers to meet with established members of the community.
<p>
Returning to the code of conduct, Ts'o noted that the mandates on
maintainers raised a lot of hackles.  The purpose wasn't really to create
more work for maintainers, though, or to turn them into police officers;
instead, it was an expression of the idea that maintainers need to lead by
example.  We should all do that, he said, and to try to talk to people when
we see borderline emails on the lists.
<p>
Mauro Carvalho Chehab expressed some worries that parts of the code of
conduct could be seen as a binding contract in Brazil.  Evidently, though,
lawyers at the Linux Foundation have reviewed it with that concern in mind
and concluded that it is not the case.  There were some questions about
what the kernel community would do if the upstream Contributor Covenant
code were to change; the answer is that the changes will be evaluated when
they happen.
<p>
As things wound down I tried to reemphasize the point that the time for
private conversations around the code of conduct passed a while back.  It
was agreed that any future discussions would happen in a public forum.
Kroah-Hartman added that, in a couple of years, it will likely become
necessary to add some other sort of sensitive, policy-related document
using a similar process, though.
<p>
When, it was asked, is Torvalds returning to the community?  He answered
that he is already back; he has gotten some pull requests and intends to
return to working normally.  It was nice, he said, to have Kroah-Hartman
take over for a while and give him a break, though.  Kroah-Hartman has
write permission to the repository now, so he may be asked to take over again
at some 
point.  Torvalds noted dryly, referring to the mixup that got the
Maintainers Summit moved to Edinburgh in the first place, that he has a
vacation coming up soon where that might be welcome.

It would perhaps be beneficial to distribute the meetings a bit, around the world, in parallel, have them at the same day and around the same topics...<br>
<p>
I donâ€™t have to talk with the top level maintainers, when we have guys like Michal Kubecek here in CZ community, who are able to brush off my rough edge and sometimes unnecessarily strongly held opinions and make me rethink, what I actually want, before I invest any measurable amount of time in developing something in a direction, which would hardly be ever merged.<br>
<p>
The discussions we have - I believe - are about just the same, or at least of the same nature, as they would be with the maintainers who will actually have a final say, whether my stuff gets merged or not.<br>
<p>
What Iâ€™m proposing shouldnâ€™t substitute any of the existing meetings I think; it could be a new opportunity and a new tool, how to shape new contributors and have them up to the task, before they send anything. I think that would save at least some of the hard feelings, I can be sure of that, being my personal best example, believe me guys :))<br>
<p>
That all is to say, that I already owe Michal a few beers ;)<br>

Yeah, at the Maintainer's Summit we actually talked about trying to do some kind of more local meetings to try to get beginning/intermediate kernel engineers to have a chance to meet the maintainers.<br>
<p>
It's a good thing to do from a public service perspective, and if there are maintainers that are willing to do that, I think that would be great.   Maintainers are super busy people who have a lot of things that we ask them to do, so I'm not sure it would be productive to make participating in local meetups a mandate.   But I certainly think it would be great if we could encourage the organization of some local "kernel development meetups" or something like that, and hopefully getting more senior developers involved.<br>
<p>
Maybe we could leverage the LUG's in various regions, but I have heard some rumors that some of the LUG's have a reputation of having a fairly toxic environment of their own, and even if they didn't, many of the LUG's appear to have a focus which is more focused on users and sysadmins, as opposed to kernel development.    Of course, there are some very strong LUG's, such as the ones which organize the SouthEaster Linux Fest (SELF) and the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE).   So there certainly are plenty of possibilities....<br>

This is what we've tried to do at linux.conf.au with the 1-day kernel miniconfs that have been run most years. It's been great to see some brand new kernel developers given the opportunity to meet maintainers. But LCA is only once a year...<br>

It's useful to know some local experts.<br>
<p>
But: one of the ideas I think was that people feel more comfortable if they can put faces to reviewers, rather than just seeing them as strange sources of frightening feedback?<br>
<p>
For that you need to meet most of the people that work in your area.  And the easiest way to do that may just be to get a bunch of them together in one place once a year or so.<br>
<p>
In which case it might be better to focus on figuring out how to get new developers to the big conferences.<br>
<p>
I dunno, maybe it's best to try both.<br>

You can only do so many events, and, as it was mentioned here, there already are a lot of conferences. That said, it's always helpful to know those people personally that you interact with regularly. While I'm not a kernel contributor, I can get very emotional when under pressure and had my experiences in that regard where I was seen as toxic by some people but personal interaction could clear up a lot of things (and I learned from those experiences as well). Local people also help because they tend to have a better understanding of your cultural aspects (us Europeans can routinely be harsh while not meaning it as badly as Californians or Asians may interpret it).<br>
So, tl;dr, both local and in-your-contribution-area meetups make sense - if you have the time to attend and still contribute in a meaningful way. <br>

<p>
Although meeting someone is probably much better, putting a face on a reviewer can also be done without.  A study suggested that radiologists work much better and find much more when they have a picture of the patient attached to the scan.  I think I read about that in the Economist, but I found an online NYT article about it[1].  I wonder whether it applies in this context too, with e.g. profile pictures?<br>

Of course, life is too short. Why is it so hard to do this consciously considering it's already common place anyway for sheer lack of time?<br>

I can only think of: 1. too much passion; 2. "someone is wrong on the internet" <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">https://xkcd.com/386/</a><br>

Note 2. happens only when "someone"' message is not *too* obviously wrong - otherwise there wouldn't have been any feedback at all in the first place.<br>

According to most schools of sociology, humans are socially responsive, which means that they will be urged to provide social feedback from social stimuli (more or less) no matter the effects.<br>
<p>
This instinct, which is not entirely rational, will override the rational choice to just ignore a stimuli in many cases.<br>
<p>
So if someone pose you a question, even if there is a good reason to ignore that question altogether, you will be inclined to answer the question, take part in the social interaction, because humans are socially responsive and very much driven by this impulse.<br>
<p>
This school of sociology will be in conflict with rational choice theories.<br>

<p>
It's not a conflict because the rational choice theories are about what people actually choose to do, not what their instincts are urging them to do. I can't recall any occasion where it was claimed that instincts or urges are expected to be rational; rather the opposite. Moreover, even if people do act on those urges, what evidence is there to say that they do *not* expect this course of action to best satisfy their own preferences in that moment?<br>

I think the option of simply blocking / ignoring someone is much underappreciated these days. People would rather use a code of conduct to get rid of the person altogether instead of just ignoring them personally, which breeds a lot more conflict than is necessary. <br>

      <p><blockquote>Of course, life is too short. Why is it so hard to do this consciously considering it's already common place anyway for sheer lack of time?</blockquote>
<p>My <i>guess</i> is that Peter feels <i>obligated</i>, by his position as maintainer, to continue to review all submitted patches -- including those from people who continually ignore his feedback; and thus the only available option he sees for responding to that situation is to escalate to attacking the person.  Being given a better pattern of response ("This is the third time you've sent patches with this code pattern.  From now on, I will review no more than one series from you per month, and I will stop immediately when I see an issue I have commented on previously") which is neither personal nor undue effort for the maintainer goes a long way towards reducing maintainer frustration.

<p>Eh, I think your obligation is to the project, not to random difficult contributors.

<p>I don't know, it's hard to discuss in the abstract.  The intersection of "capable of providing some value to the project" and "completely ignores clear feedback" sounds rather small, and I'm not thinking of any examples.

<p>The more frequent case is that it's one of those technical disputes where people are just talking past each other.  And in that case it's easy to get caught up in the back and forth and fail to understand something the other person's saying, and regardless of which one's in the right, both often come away with the impression that the other is intentionally refusing to listen, even though that's not exactly what's going on.

<p>I really think the best you can do in that case sometimes is just to drop the subject, and if they ignore clear requests to do that, at some point it's more effective just to stop responding.

"Just listen to what I'm actually saying, not what you're hearing". You need a 3rd-party to step in and moderate, and say "this is the real issue".<br>
<p>
That's one of my big bug-bears in normal life too - people assume they know what I'm going to say, and never wait for me to say it (when actually, I'm usually going to say something rather different ...)<br>

There has been much work done on the problem of dealing with difficult people, from non-violent communication, to negotiation, to working on oneself to understand what one finds difficult about them in the first place (not that some people are not intrinsically difficult, but there is usually that side too).  Studying this sort of work often pays dividends in many situations.<br>

Communist manifesto also looked good and progressive. But finally we got Stalin, Mao Zedong, Pol Pot... History teaches thst people should always check who is standing behind laws and rules you want to take into use. CoC is written and promoted by crazy and rude fanatic and behaviour of this person breaks rules of the CoC itself (e.g. see <a href="https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1029165775213486086">https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1029165775213486086</a> or  <a href="https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1029167431825207301?s=20">https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/102916743182520730...</a>, more examples are there: <a href="http://imgur.com/aksUZ7Z">http://imgur.com/aksUZ7Z</a>).<br>

It's unfortunate that often the people that push the CoC display extremely toxic behavior themselves. I remember when Sage (as Sarah) Sharp left Linux kernel development, they (falsely) accused Linus Torvalds of threatening people with violence: <a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=137390362508794&amp;w=2">https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=137390362508794&amp;...</a> <br>

You clearly are trying to mislead and deceive people. Here's the quote:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Not *fucking* cool.  Violence, whether it be physical intimidation,</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; verbal threats or verbal abuse is not acceptable.  Keep it professional</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; on the mailing lists.</font><br>

Where's the accusation here?<br>

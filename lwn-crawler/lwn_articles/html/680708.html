           <p>March 24, 2016</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p>It has been <a href="/Articles/571995/">said</a> that an important part of a maintainer's role is to
say &quot;no&quot;.  Just how this &quot;no&quot; is said can define the style and
effectiveness of a maintainer.  Linus Torvalds recently displayed just
how effective his style can be when saying &quot;<a href="http://mid.gmane.org/CA+55aFx_NPn0VYk=+Ad5S_r=D6J1xFmWmf7JzQ7RmkwKmdkYOg@mail.gmail.com">no</a>&quot; to a pair of fairly
innocuous <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/20160302040932.16685.62789.stgit@birch.djwong.org">patches</a>
to add a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command for block devices — patches in
their fifth revision that had already received &quot;Reviewed-by&quot; tags from
Christoph Hellwig:</p> 
<div class="BigQuote">
NAK, just based on annoyance with the randomness of this interface
</div>

<p>It became clear that Torvalds only had a fairly general understanding
of the underlying functionality and didn't much care about it anyway.
What he cared about, as he said, was the interface.  It seemed both
"<q>too specific</q>" and too generic; "<q>too 'future-proofing'</q>".</p>

<p>These complaints led to a wide-ranging discussion that brought out a
number of underlying issues, drew parallels between disparate parts of
the storage stack, and resulted in a new interface proposal that
gives quite a different flavor to the same basic operations.</p>

<h4>The heart of the matter</h4>

<p>Modern storage devices can do a lot more with stored data than simply
read or write arbitrary blocks.  Of the other operations the best
known is doubtlessly "discard".  This operation, named
     <tt>TRIM</tt> in the ATA protocol and <tt>UNMAP</tt> in SCSI, tells
     the storage device that the data in some data blocks is no 
longer needed.  It is well-known because it is both valuable and
problematic.  Some SSDs work better if unused data is regularly
trimmed, but trim implementations work differently on
different devices, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
This variation means that users often need to know precise details of
their hardware to achieve the best performance.</p>

<p>There is an operation that is the inverse of discard that is important
for thin-provisioned devices.  Thin provisioning allows a storage
array to appear to be extremely large, while only having physical
capacity for a much smaller amount of storage.  As data is written,
the available storage is allocated to the target addresses.  As
the free space shrinks, the device administrator is alerted and action
can be taken, which could include acquiring extra physical capacity.</p>

<p>A particularly useful operation when using a thin-provisioned device
is to request that storage space be allocated before actually writing data
to it.  This makes it possible to report allocation problems earlier
and to avoid unpleasant surprises.  The SCSI spec refers to these
unwritten allocations as <tt>ANCHORED</tt> blocks, and supports anchoring
with the <tt>WRITE SAME</tt> SCSI command, which writes a
particular block of data (often zeros) to multiple locations over a given
range of 
addresses.</p>

<p>
   The Linux block layer has an interface, <tt>blkdev_issue_zeroout()</tt>, that
   combines both the de-allocation of discard and the pre-allocation of
   <tt>WRITE SAME</tt> with the more generic goal of zeroing out a range of
   blocks on a device.  Depending on the capabilities of the device and
   on the "discard" flag that is passed to the function as a hint, it
   will issue a discard request (i.e. <tt>TRIM</tt> or <tt>UNMAP</tt>), a
   <tt>WRITE SAME</tt> 
   request, or write a zeroed page of memory to every block in the
   range.  Future reads are guaranteed to return zeros, but pre-allocation
   or de-allocation happens on a best-effort basis.
<p>
   The "discard" hint flag and the possible issuing of a discard request
   is a relatively recent addition and is, importantly, different from the
   similar <tt>blkdev_issue_discard()</tt> interface.  The latter will issue a
   discard even if the result might be that subsequent reads return
   random data.  <tt>blkdev_issue_zeroout()</tt> will only issue a discard if
   future reads will reliably return zeros.

<h4>Simple patches for a simple problem</h4>

<p>The pair of patches that Darrick Wong posted does two things.  Primarily
they add a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command so that the "discard" flag can be
set from user space; the existing
<tt>BLKZEROOUT</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls <tt>blkdev_issue_zeroout()</tt>
but always sets the "discard" flag to zero.  Hoping not to have to create
yet-another-command if even more functionality is ever added to
<tt>blkdev_issue_zeroout()</tt>, Wong defined the new
<tt>BLKZEROOUT2</tt> with room 
for expansion: 32 flags of which only one was used, and even some
&quot;padding&quot; fields that must be zero now, but could be defined later.</p>

<p>The other effect of these patches is to purge parts of the page cache for the
block device when blocks are zeroed.  Normal reads and writes on a block device
(e.g. <tt>/dev/sda</tt>) are cached in the page cache.  An <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> write
is instead sent directly to the device, which could make it
inconsistent with the page cache. To avoid such inconsistency, the
corresponding pages of the page cache are removed when an <tt>O_DIRECT</tt>
write happens.  <tt>BLKZEROOUT</tt> is much like an <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> write, so,
with the patches applied, both it and <tt>BLKZEROOUT2</tt>
will purge the page cache.</p>

<p>Torvalds's response seems to be based on an intuitive &quot;it doesn't feel
right&quot; rather than clear logical reasoning.  One flaw he identified
was not actually present in the code; it boiled down to &quot;I absolutely
<em>detest</em> code that tries to be overly forward-thinking&quot;, which is a
little surprising given the <a href="/Articles/585415/">problems</a> there
have been with system 
calls not having a suitable <tt>flags</tt> argument.  Most of the rest is
summed up by his comment: "<q>So the whole patch looks
pointless.</q>"  He 
did approve of purging the page cache, though.</p>
 
<p>As the discussion progressed and requirements were more explicitly
stated, the source of Torvalds's discomfort became clearer.  The
operations of interest deserved to be thought about at a much higher
level than just <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands for a block device.  They are
much more like 
operations on a file — to allocate and de-allocate backing store.</p>

<p>The Linux <tt>fallocate()</tt> system call has a flag <tt>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</tt>,
which is a lot like <tt>TRIM</tt>, particularly the style of <tt>TRIM</tt>
that causes future reads
to return zeros.  <tt>fallocate()</tt> also has
that <tt>FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE</tt> flag,
which 
is a good match for <tt>WRITE SAME</tt> or writing zeros.  Rather than providing
an <tt>ioctl()</tt> command that seems focused on matching low-level
functionality 
provided by certain hardware, using <tt>fallocate()</tt> would reuse an
existing high-level interface that is described in terms of the needs
of applications.  Existing <tt>fallocate()</tt> implementations already
purge 
the page cache as appropriate, so had this approach been used instead
of the initial <tt>BLKZEROOUT</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command, it is
likely that those implementations 
would have been used as a guide, so we would not have the current
situation where zeros can be written without any purge.</p>

<p>Wong provided a <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/20160305005556.29738.66782.stgit@birch.djwong.org">new patch set</a> that added <tt>fallocate()</tt> support for
block devices; this received much warmer support from Torvalds.  He
found a few little nits, but admitted that "<q>on the whole, I like it</q>".
This was a fitting close to a maintainership interaction done really
well: Torvalds followed his intuition and complained about things
that bothered him, despite not having a full picture of the problem
space.  Wong responded directly, called Torvalds out where he was
clearly wrong, and attempted to justify other choices with extra
details.  A more complete picture was formed, against which preferences
could be explained more coherently.  Finally a resolution was found,
implemented, and approved — apparently to everyone's satisfaction.
This is a model worth following.</p>

<h4>An enlightening tangent</h4>

<p>While the conclusion to the main thread of discussion was that
treating block devices a bit more like files could make it easier to
work with new hardware, there was a <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/20160303223952.GE24012@thunk.org">sub-thread</a> that seemed to head in a
complementary direction.</p>

<p>There appear to be a number of user-space file servers — Ceph was given
as an example — that use a local filesystem to store data, but aren't
really interested in many of the traditional semantics of a
filesystem.  A good example of this is the <tt>O_NOMTIME</tt> flag that was
<a href="/Articles/643892/">discussed</a> last year.  These file servers really just want space to
store data and want reads and writes to that space to be passed
down to the device with minimal friction from the filesystem.</p>

<p>In much the same way as described earlier for thin provisioning,
these file servers need to be able to allocate space and write to it
later.  While they wouldn't object to that space being filled with
zeros, they really don't care about the contents of the space, but they
do care about the allocation and subsequent writes being fast.</p>

<p>Filesystems do support pre-allocating space with <tt>fallocate()</tt>, but
they typically do so by recording which blocks have been written and
which have only been anchored.  This means that each
subsequent write needs to spend time updating metadata:
extra work that brings no value to the file server.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the sub-thread, Ted Ts'o mentioned in passing that
he had out-of-tree patches that 
provide a flag, <tt>FALLOC_FL_NO_HIDE_STALE</tt>, that would do exactly what
the file servers want: allocate space so that future writes happen
with no further metadata updates.  In general, this can be a security
issue since reading data from those ranges could return potentially
sensitive data belonging to some other user.</p>

<p>Ts'o's patches restrict this operation to a single privileged
group ID. There were suggestions that a mount option should be used instead
of, or maybe as well as, a special group ID.  There were also
observations that using the flag in containers could lead to unexpected
information leaks.  Possibly the most vocal critic was Dave Chinner
who was <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160303231050.GU29057@dastard">blunt</a>: "<q>it is dangerous and compromises system
security. As such, it does not belong in upstream kernels.</q>"
An example he gave of possible information leaks was automated
backups.  While the application that pre-allocated space may be
trusted to never look at the stale data, once it leaks out in
backups it seems to be more exposed.</p>

<p>
   Torvalds <a
   href="http://mid.gmane.org/CA+55aFwHLJffmN-Dw=yZCGKzxe_2Tm9h2GjdaFL3JdvYXNstRw@mail.gmail.com">wasn't
   convinced</a> by Chinner's fears; his only requirement is that 
   it isn't <i>too</i> easy to do something dangerous.  He has always been in
   favor of providing functionality if people are actually going to use
   it, so the fact that Ts'o has this out-of-tree patch that is widely
   used within Google does carry weight.
   It was also noted that the presence of these performance issues
   has <a
   href="http://mid.gmane.org/CAC6JEv-CGaphHj6hVXUhFS+Dc4jS46nO1yOfKF5yA8AnDwqgOw@mail.gmail.com">already
   caused</a> Ceph developers to give up on using a local 
   filesystem and to instead start using block devices directly, so the
   issues are clearly real.
If performance benefits can be
   clearly demonstrated and application developers affirm that they
   would use the functionality, then remaining barriers are unlikely to
   stand for long.

<p>If we step back for a moment to grasp the big picture, what we see
here is the cluster filesystem using a local filesystem a lot like a
logical volume manager.  It wants storage space of arbitrary size with
the ability to expand later.  It doesn't care about any metadata
except the size, and doesn't care about the initial contents, which in
practice could be stale data.  This sounds exactly like the
logical volumes that LVM2 can provide, though by being embedded in a
filesystem they are much easier to manage than LVM2 volumes.  In a mirror
image of the 
decision to treat block devices more like files so as to meet the
needs of low-level hardware, it seems that we might want to treat
files more like block devices so as to meet the needs of high-level
filesystems.</p>
   
<p>As Chinner himself noted, there are synergies here with the &quot;splitting
filesystems in two&quot; idea that he <a href="/Articles/592091/#splitting">floated</a> at the Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit in 2014.  While nothing
appears to have come of that yet, it is valuable food for thought and
something may yet arise as needs and options become clearer.  The
distinction that Chinner made between &quot;names&quot; and
&quot;storage&quot; certainly 
seems stronger than the distinction between &quot;files&quot; and &quot;block
devices&quot;, which is showing its weakness.  If the old lines are going to
blur, it might be useful to have new lines to focus our thoughts on a
clearer overall picture.  That way, we might not need to depend so
much on the intuition of experienced maintainers.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; This was a fitting close to a maintainership interaction done really well: Torvalds followed his intuition and complained about things that bothered him, despite not having a full picture of the problem space. Wong responded directly, called Torvalds out where he was clearly wrong, and attempted to justify other choices with extra details. A more complete picture was formed, against which preferences could be explained more coherently. Finally a resolution was found, implemented, and approved — apparently to everyone's satisfaction. This is a model worth following.</font><br>
<p>
Cheers for highlighting this. Amidst complaints that interaction on the LKML and other venues is uncivil and hostile, it is nice to have examples of interactions that went well, and *why* they turned out well. There was a BOF during last year's DebConf where the issue of recognising pleasant and effective communication was raised [link to video]:<br>

Agree 100%, the LKML is nowhere near as bad as Hacker News would like to believe.  Great article.<br>
<p>
That said, I'd like to hear a little more about how Wong called Linus out where he was clearly wrong.  :)<br>

This article states Torvalds "only had a fairly general understanding of the underlying functionality" and later "Torvalds followed his intuition and complained about things that bothered him, despite not having a full picture of the problem space. Wong responded directly, called Torvalds out where he was clearly wrong, and attempted to justify other choices with extra details".<br>
<p>
Some readers may be tempted to interpret that as Torvalds not being qualified to object to the patch (he was "wrong" and Wong was right to "call him out" on that). I'd like to give a different interpretation, as someone who helps maintain another free software project:<br>
<p>
The patch contributor failed to give the required information to understand the patch-set in their commit message. Both in terms of explaining the abstract motivations, in terms of the use-cases (starting at a high-level) and explaining how the implementation addressed the motivation.<br>
<p>
<p>
I see this a *lot* in contributions to the project I work on. We get patches with commit messages that fail to communicate *why* the patch exists to begin with, and then *how* it addresses the motivation. Further, the "how" part should also mention alternative possible approaches and discuss the pro/cons of the chosen approach and why it is the most suitable - this is almost *never* done.<br>
<p>
Contributors need to understand their commit message is the "map" the reviewer/maintainer will use to mentally make their way around the patch and judge it. If no real "map" is provided, the reviewer/maintainer will have to reconstruct it for themselves, if that's even possible. At a minimum they'll have expended more effort and may be grumpier as a result. As a contributor you really want to lower the friction for someone else to review your patch. So provide a commit message with structure that addresses the motivation and implementation of the patch, and its effects. I.e.:<br>
<p>
- Why?: What was the original problem or use-case? (in the abstract, independent of this patch).<br>
<p>
- How?: How does this patch address the problem or use-case? What other approaches were considered and why was this approach chosen? What limitations does this approach have? What limitations does this implementation have?<br>
<p>
- What?: What was the result? What testing was done (and how can it be tested)? What effect was there on performance?<br>
<p>
Discussing the "why" is needed to help convince a maintainer a patch is actually needed. Maintainers see lots of patches, and they need to decide whether the benefit of the patch is worth the churn to the codebase of the code-base. A patch whose motivation is unclear or not well explained risks getting dismissed as useless churn!<br>
<p>
Discussing the "How" is useful in convincing the maintainer that you've thought through the patch, and considered other alternatives - especially for any non-trivial patches. For longer patches, providing a detailed walk-through can help in convincing the maintainer that you've at least self-reviewed the patch before hitting send.<br>
<p>
Discussing the "What" is useful to give the maintainer confidence in the patch. Note, that if you've done /no/ testing that you should say that. It is much better to say it up front. Others will at least have confidence in /you/ and that you will be clear when your patch has had no testing.<br>
<p>
tl;dr: If a maintainer didn't understand your patch, then the problem very likely was that your commit message sucked. Write good commit messages!<br>

I guess this must have cost implications, but would it not be impossible to have two counters? Disks tend to write and allocate space from the start, so you do the same thing for files here :-)<br>
<p>
If I want, say, 1TB as a virtual disk, there's nothing stopping the system allocating that space. It then sets a "high water mark" at 0. The guarantee is that any attempt to write beyond the high water mark will fill the space between the old high water mark and where I'm writing with 0s before resetting the high water mark. Any attempt to read beyond the high water mark will return zeros. That way, I can't read any disk that I haven't written.<br>
<p>
Actually, that sounds very like the current setup with holes in files, which are supposed to return 0s if a read hits a hole, aren't they? But this pushes the bulk of the cost of the security onto writes, which are slow anyway, so would that be a reasonable trade-off?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Wol<br>

<p>
Do they?  I don't think disks allocate space at all - they provide space.<br>
File systems allocate space.  Some, like FAT, may allocate from the start.  Many "modern" filesystems have allocation groups sprinkled across the address space and allocate from different allocation groups based on different criteria.<br>
I don't think a high water mark would help a lot.<br>

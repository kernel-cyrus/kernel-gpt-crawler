<h1>The -mm development tree</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 5, 2004 by corbet]

Andrew Morton's -mm kernel tree now fills the role which might have once
been taken by an odd-numbered development series.  We don't have 2.7.x;
instead, new stuff finds its way into 2.6.x-mm.  So it can be interesting
to step back, occasionally, and look at what patches are lurking there.
<p>
2.6.9-rc3-mm2 contains a full 1213 patches.  About half of these come from
trees managed by various subsystem maintainers; seeing what those are
usually requires pulling a separate BitKeeper tree and looking inside.
These trees hold patches which are usually (usually!) relatively small and
maintenance-oriented.  The external trees brought into -mm currently
include those dedicated to the ACPI, AGPGART, ALSA, i2c, IDE, IEEE 1394,
input, serial ATA, networking, NTFS, driver core, PCI, USB, and SCSI
subsystems. 
<p>
Among the other 654 patches in 2.6.9-rc3-mm2 are found:
<p>
<ul>

<li> A change to how rlimit settings are interpreted; they become
     per-process settings, rather than per-thread.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/69523/">sysfs backing store patches</a>
     continue to languish in -mm, apparently waiting for a review from some
     of the core developers.
<p>
<li> Ingo Molnar's "generic IRQ subsystem" work.  These patches, <a
     href="/Articles/104844/">posted</a> on October&nbsp;2, are a big
     reorganization of the interrupt handling code.  Over the years, much
     of the IRQ code had been copied from one architecture to the next,
     leading to a lot of duplicated functions.  These patches pull the
     generic code out of the architecture subtrees and remove some 3000
     lines of code from the kernel.
<p>
<li> Numerous kernel debugger (kgdb) patches continue to live in -mm; as
     always, they are unlikely to move into the mainline.
<p>
<li> They get less attention than they used to, but there are still <a
     href="/Articles/105171/">must-fix</a> and <a
     href="/Articles/105172/">should-fix</a> lists in -mm.
<p>
<li> Arjan van de Ven's patch which keeps processes from being able to
     overwrite kernel memory via <tt>/dev/mem</tt>.  This patch has been
     shipped with Red Hat/Fedora kernels for a while, but is not yet in the
     mainline. 
<p>
<li> An extensive set of ext3 patches implementing <a
     href="/Articles/81357/">block reservations</a>.  Stephen Tweedie has
     recently resumed working on these patches, so they may move forward in
     the near future.  The ext3 online resizing patch set is also in -mm.
<p>
<li> Mikael Pettersson's performance counters patches.
<p>
<li> The -mm tree continues to be a testing ground for scheduler patches.
     It currently contains Peter Williams's Single Priority Array scheduler
     (<a href="/Articles/96554/">covered briefly</a> here last August).
     There is also an extensive set of scheduling domains fixes and a
     number of latency-reduction patches from Ingo Molnar's work.
<p>
<li> Ingo Molnar's <a href="/Articles/102253/">big kernel semaphore</a>
     patch. 
<p>
<li> A set of PCMCIA patches adding driver model and hotplug support.
<p>
<li> A big DVD+RW support patch, which includes CDRW packet writing
     support. 
<p>
<li> Support for in-kernel keyrings and their management.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/100321/">CacheFS</a> filesystem.
<p>
<li> The kexec patches, including support for using kexec as a kernel crash
     dump mechanism.
<p>
<li> The reiser4 filesystem and a large number of fixes.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/102976/">modular I/O schedulers patch</a> and
     the reworked "completely fair queueing" scheduler.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/104333/"><tt>remap_page_range()</tt> change</a>
     to <tt>remap_pfn_range()</tt>.
<p>
<li> A security module implementing the BSD "secure levels" mechanism.
</ul>
<p>

Mixed in with these big patches is the usual array of architecture updates,
subsystem fixes, etc.  
<p>
In other words, -mm is a big patch; it is significantly different from the
mainline kernel.  For some developers, it is too far removed; David Miller
recently <a href="/Articles/105177/">responded</a> to a request to test
networking changes in -mm this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Putting the net stuff into -mm makes debugging of networking
	changes harder, as -mm has a ton of experimental stuff in it as
	well.  -mm frequently makes machines unbootable, and particularly
	this is felt on non-x86 platforms such as sparc64 which is where I
	do all of my work.
</div>
<p>

This kind of observation is not new; many developers continued to create
their patches on the 2.4 kernel long after the 2.5 branch opened because
2.5 struck them as being too unstable.  When one is trying to shake out
bugs in new code, it is nice to minimize the number of other unrelated,
disruptive changes.  That said, -mm continues to be the main staging area
for much of the code going into the mainline, and many developers target it
specifically with their patches.  Given the number of bugs found after
patches go into -mm, people are clearly running it as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      What's happening with reiser4, since the couple weeks of LWN coverage a <br>
few weeks ago?  Based on that, I decided to hold off in converting my <br>
presently reiserfs system to reiser4, but I'd expect (and the "many fixes" <br>
comment seems to support) progress is being made. <br>
 <br>
The main thing I'm interested in, given a recognition that there /are/ <br>
after all other things to cover as well &lt;g&gt;, is what timeframe we are <br>
looking at for mainline kernel inclusion, next month, 1Q2005, 2H2005, <br>
or... <br>
 <br>
Well, that, and if progress /is/ being made on the possible race and <br>
security issues as previously covered.  Based on that coverage, I decided <br>
it wasn't something I wanted to try immediately.  However, I still might <br>
be interested in trying it before mainline introduction, once the large <br>
part of those issues are addressed and the patches get into mm or the <br>
like. <br>

      unfortunantly projects really don't get scheduled for inclusion, they work along with various bugfixes and changes until they are acceptable and then they get in. you can get a minimum timeframe (no chance in less then 6 months type of thing) but nothing more definate then that.<br>
<p>
Reiser4 is adding a LOT of new things and even if the code had no problems that needed to be worked on other then that the inclusion date would still be very questionable. In this case it is very possible that a lot of work will need to be done outside of reiser4 before it gets included (look at XFS for example, it was available for years before it was included, it worked well during most of that time, but it affected lots of things so it wasn't included until those external things were modified to the point that XFS didn't need to modify them)<br>
<p>
personally I would not plan on useing reiser4 for anything I really cared about for at least a year, probably more. even after it gets included it will need to develop a track record to show that it really is safe to use on production boxes<br>

      ---- Arjan van de Ven's patch which keeps processes from being able to overwrite kernel memory via /dev/mem. This patch has been shipped with Red Hat/Fedora kernels for a while, but is not yet in the mainline. <br>
<p>
Anybody knows where can I get this patch? (off the -mm tree, ofcourse) <br>
<p>
Many thanks.<br>

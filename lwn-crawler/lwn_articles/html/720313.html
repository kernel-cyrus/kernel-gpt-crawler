<p>Linux usage in networking hardware has been on the rise for some
time. During the latest <a href="http://netdevconf.org/2.1/">Netdev conference</a> held in Montreal this April,
people talked seriously about Linux running on high end, "top of rack"
(TOR) networking equipment. Those devices have long been the realm of
proprietary hardware and software companies like Cisco or Juniper, but
Linux seems to be making some significant headway into the
domain. According to Shrijeet
Mukherjee, VP of Engineering at  Cumulus Networks: "we are seeing a 28%
adoption rate in the Fortune 50" 
companies.

<p>
As someone who has worked in system administration and
networking for over a decade, I was surprised by this: switches have
always been black boxes of proprietary hardware that we barely get a
shell into. But as more and more TOR hardware gets Linux support, some
of that work trickles down outside of that niche. Are we really seeing
the rise of Linux in high-end networking hardware?</p>

<h4>Linux as the standard interface</h4>

<p>During
<a href="http://netdevconf.org/2.1/news.html?news-brandeburg-keynote">his keynote</a> at
Netdev, Jesse Brandeburg explained that traffic is
exploding on the Internet: "From 2006 to 2016 the compound annual growth
rate was 78% of 
  network traffic. So the network traffic is growing like crazy. In
  2010 to 2023, it's going to grow by a thousand times."

<p>He also mentioned Intel was working on devices that could do up to 400
Gbps. In his talk, he argued that Linux has a critical place in the
modern world by repeating the mantra that "everything is on the
network, and the network runs Linux", but does it really?  Through
Android, Linux has become the most popular end-user device operating system
and is also
dominant on the server — but what about the actual fabric of the
network: the routers and switches that interconnect all those
machines?</p>

<p>Mukherjee, in his own <a
href="http://netdevconf.org/2.1/session.html?mukherjee">keynote</a>, argued
that even though Linux has 
achieved dominance in the server and virtualization markets, there is
a "discontinuity [...] at the boundary where the host and the network
meet" and argued "that the host without the network will not survive".
In other words, proprietary hardware and software in the network
threaten free software in the server. Even though some
manufacturers are already providing a "Linux interface" in their
hardware, it is often only some sort of compatibility shell which might
be compared with
the
<a href="/Articles/681768/">Ubuntu compatibility layer in Windows</a>:
it's not a real Linux.</p>

<p>Mukherjee pushed this idea further by saying that
those companies are limiting themselves by not using the full Linux
stack. He presented Linux as the "top vehicle for innovation" that
provides a featureful network stack, citing VXLAN, eBPF, and Quagga as
prime features used on switches. 
Mukherjee also praised the
diversity of the user-space Linux ecosystem as something that
commercial alternatives can't rival; he compared the faster Linux
development to the commercial sector where similar top features stay
in the beta stage for up to 3 years.

<p>
    Because of its dominance in the server market, consumers are
    expecting a Linux-like interface on their networking gear now, which means
Linux could be the standard
interface all providers strive toward.
As a Debian developer, I can't
help but smile at the thought; if there's one thing we have <em>not</em> been
able to do among Linux distributions, it's pretty much standardize user
space in a consistent interface. POSIX is old and incomplete,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">FHS</a>
is showing its age, and most distributions have
abandoned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base">LSB</a>. Yet, the
idea is certainly enticing: there is a base set of tools and
applications, especially for the Linux kernel, that <em>are</em>
standardized: <tt>iproute2</tt>, <tt>ethtool</tt>, and <tt>iptables</tt>
are generally consistent 
across distributions, even though each distribution has its own way of
using them.</p>

<p>Yet Linux is not dominant, why? Mukherjee identified the problem as
"packaging issues" and listed a set of features he would like Linux to
improve:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Standardization of the <code>ethtool</code> interface</em>. The idea is to make
<code>ethtool</code> a de-facto standard to manage switches and
ports. Mukherjee gave the example that data centers spend more
money on cables than any other hardware and explained that making
it easier to identify cables is therefore a key
functionality. Getting consistent interface naming was also a key
problem identified by numerous participants at the
conference. While systemd tried to fix this with
the
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/">predictable network interface names</a> specification,
the interface names are not necessarily predictable across virtual
machines or on special hardware; in fact, this was the topic of
the
<a href="http://netdevconf.org/2.1/session.html?hemminger">first talk of the conference</a>. <code>ethtool</code>
also needs to support interfaces that run faster than 1&nbsp;Gbps, something
that still has limited support in Linux at the moment.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Scaling of the Linux bridge</em>. Through the rise of "software
defined networking", we are likely to see multi-switch virtual
environments that need to scale to hundreds of interfaces and
devices easily. This is something the Linux bridge was never
designed to do and it's showing scalability issues. During
the conference, there was hope that the <a href="/Articles/719850/">new XDP
and eBPF 
developments</a> could help, but also concerns this would create yet
another bridge layer inside the kernel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cumulus's goal seems to be to establish Linux as the industry standard
for this new era of networking and it is not alone. Through
its <a href="http://opencompute.org/">Open Compute project</a>, Facebook is
sharing open designs of data center products and, while we have yet to
see commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 24 and 48-port gigabit switches
trickle down to the consumer market, the company is definitely deploying new
hardware based on those specifications in its own data centers, and
those devices are often based on Linux.</p>

<h4>The Linux switch implementation</h4>

<p>So how exactly do switches work in Linux?</p>

<p>The Linux kernel manipulates switches with three different operation
structures: <code>switchdev_ops</code>, which
we <a href="/Articles/675826/">previously covered</a>,
<code>ethtool_ops</code>, and <code>netdev_ops</code>. Certain switches,
however, also 
need
<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/dsa/dsa.txt">distributed
switch architecture (DSA)</a> features to be properly
handled.  DSA is a more obscure part of the network stack that allows
Linux to represent hardware switches or chains of switches using
regular Linux tools like <tt>bridge</tt>, <tt>ifconfig</tt>, and so
on. While switchdev 
is a new layer, DSA has been in the
kernel <a href="/Articles/302333/">since 2.6.28</a> in 2008. Originally
developed to support Marvell switches, DSA is now a generic layer deployed
in WiFi access points, set-top boxes, on-board flight entertainment
systems, trains, and other industrial equipment. Switches that have an
Ethernet controller need DSA, whereas the kernel can
support switches without Ethernet controllers directly with switchdev
drivers.</p>

<p>The first years of DSA's development consisted only of basic
maintenance but, in the last three years, DSA has seen a resurgence of
contributions, as part of Linux networking push to support hardware
offloading and network switches. Between 2014 and 2015, DSA added
support for Broadcom hardware, wake on LAN, and hardware port bridging,
among other features.</p>

<p>DSA's development was parallel
to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/swconfig">swconfig</a>, written
by the <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a> project to support the
small office and home office (SOHO) routers that the project is
targeting. The main 
difference between swconfig and DSA is that DSA-supported switches
show one network interface per port, whereas swconfig-configured
switches show up as a single port, which limits the amount of information
that can be extracted from the switch. For example, you cannot have
per-port traffic statistics with swconfig. That limitation is what led to the
creation of the switchdev framework, when swconfig
was <a href="/Articles/571390/">proposed</a> (then refused) for
inclusion in mainline. Another goal of switchdev was to support
bridge hardware offloading and network interface card (NIC)
virtualization.</p>

<p>Also, whereas swconfig
uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">virtual LAN (VLAN)</a>
tagging to address ports, DSA enables
the use of device-specific tagging headers to address different ports,
which enables DSA to have better control over the switches. This
allows, for example, DSA to
do
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol">internet
group management protocol (IGMP)</a>
snooping or implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol">spanning tree
protocol</a>, whereas swconfig doesn't have those features. Some 
switches are actually connected to the host CPU through an Ethernet
interface instead of regular PCI-Express interface, and DSA supports
this as well.</p>

<p>One advantage that remains in the swconfig approach is that it
treats the internal switch as a simple external switch, and addresses
ports with standard VLAN tags. This is something DSA could do,
as well, but no one has bothered implementing this just yet. For now,
DSA drivers use device-specific tagging mechanisms that limit the
number of supported devices. Other areas of future improvement for DSA are
better multi-chip support, IGMP snooping, and bonding, as well as firewall, NAT,
and TC offloading.</p> 

<h4>Where is the freedom?</h4>

<p>Given all those technical improvements, you might rightfully wonder if
your own wireless router or data center switch runs Linux.</p>

<p>In recent years, we have seen more and more networking devices shipped
with Linux and sometimes even OpenWrt (e.g. in the case of the Turris
Omnia, which
we <a href="/Articles/705051/">previously covered</a>), and
especially on SOHO routers, but it sometimes means a crippled
operating system that only offers you a proprietary web interface. But
at least those efforts make it easier to deploy free operating systems
on those devices.</p>

<p>Based on my experience running OpenWrt on wireless routers to build
the <a href="https://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/">Montreal mesh network</a>, deploying
Linux on routers and switches has always been a manual process. The
Ubiquiti hardware being used in the mesh network comes with an OpenWrt
derivative, but it 
includes proprietary drivers and a proprietary web interface. To
use the mesh networking protocol that was chosen, it was necessary to deploy
custom OpenWrt images by hand. For years, it was a continuous
struggle for OpenWrt developers to liberate generation after
generation of proprietary hardware with companies like Cisco locking
down the venerable WRT platform in 2006 and the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) rules that forced TP-Link
to <a href="/Articles/679801/">block free software on its routers</a>, a change
that was <a href="/Articles/695994/">later reverted</a>.</p>

<p>Most hardware providers are obviously not dedicated to software
freedom: deploying Linux on their hardware is for them an economic,
not political choice. As you might expect, a "Linux router" these
days often means a closed device and operating system, using
Linux as the only free component. I had the privilege of doing some
reverse engineering on the SmartRG SR603n VDSL modem, which also
doubles as a WiFi router and VoIP phone adapter. I was able to get a
shell on that machine, and what I found was a custom operating system
built on top of the Linux kernel. I

<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-10-20-smartrg-sr630n-proprietary-router-running-linux/">wrote a detailed report about this</a> two
years ago and the situation then was pretty grim.</p>

<p>Another experience I had was working over a decade in data centers,
which tells an even worse story: most switches and routers there are
not running free software at all. We have deployed HP ProCurve
switches that provide free (as in beer) software updates and have
struggled for years to find free (as in speech) software alternatives
for those. We built our own routers using COTS server hardware, at a
significant performance cost over the dedicated 
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) built into commercial
routers, which do not offer us the trust and flexibility we were
looking for.</p>

<p>But Linux is definitely making some headway, and has been for a
while. When we covered switchdev in February 2016, it was just getting
started, but now vendors like Mellanox, Broadcom, Cumulus, and Intel
are writing and shipping code using the framework. Cumulus, in
particular, is developing a Debian-based distribution
(<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/CumulusLinux">Cumulus Linux</a>)
that it deploys for clients
on
<a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/">targeted hardware</a>.
Most of the hardware in that list, however, is not actually open in
the more radical sense: they are devices that can run free software
but are not
generally
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware">open-source hardware</a>. There
are some exceptions, but they sit at the higher end of the spectrum:
most organizations probably don't need a 100&nbsp;Gbps ports, let alone the
128 ports in
the
<a
href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/about/press-releases/detail/20170124-backpack-modular-switch-platform-available-to-order-from-cumulus-networks/">Backpack
switch</a> that Cumulus
is shipping.</p>

<p>How much this translates to actual freedom for the end-user is
therefore questionable. While I have seen encouraging progress on the
high end of the hardware spectrum at Netdev, I'm not sure this
will translate into immediate wins in the data center or even for home
users in the short term. In the long term, however, we will hopefully
see some progress in Linux's rise in general-purpose networking
hardware following its dominance in general-purpose computing.</p>

Arista switches run a modified (custom kernel and ultra minimal operating system) based on Fedora Linux the last time I ripped apart the root filesystem of one (~6 years ago) with dual socket AMD Athlons.

Juniper also runs Linux on some of their switches and routers.  But they mostly use that as a virtualization platform, and run FreeBSD inside a KVM guest, and inside that FreeBSD VM, they run their own proprietary routing and switching daemons and configuration CLI.  And of course, all the actual packet forwarding (both at layer 2 and layer 3) is performed by proprietary ASICs (e.g. their own Trio chip in MX routers, Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk on QFX5100 and QFX5200 switches).  The stuff inside the FreeBSD machine only handles packets directed to the router/switch itself.<br>
<p>
Those Broadcom chips are also what is used in the Facebook Open Compute switches, including that Backpack switch referenced in the main article.  Calling those switches "open source hardware" is stretching things a bit, imho, since all the interresting stuff is in those chips, and most information about them are covered by NDAs.  I have gotten the impression that even the large switch vendors are only given a library in binary form for configuring the chip, not specifications for the protocol actually used to communicate with the chip.<br>

I'm surely going to read more about all the frameworks mentioned, but I mostly wanted to say how much I liked the whole series. I've worked in system administration and networking for almost a decade too and in recent years I've been spending most of my time on the networking side so reading more about new Linux developments in this sector was very interesting. Thank you very much for this.<br>

<h1>Block layer: solid-state storage, timeouts, affinity, and more</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 15, 2008</br>
           </div>
The 2.6.28 merge window has seen the addition of a number of changes to the
block layer.  Here's a summary of the new features and APIs which have gone
in.
<p>

<h3>Solid-state storage devices</h3>
<p>
There are some enhancements aimed at improving the kernel's support
of solid state storage devices.   One of those, the discard API, has been
<a href="/Articles/293658">covered here</a> before.  This API allows
high-level block subsystem 
users (filesystems) to indicate that a particular range of blocks no longer
contains useful data.  That allows the low-level device to incorporate
those blocks into its garbage collection scheme and to stop worrying about
their contents when performing wear leveling.
<p>

Since the initial LWN article, though, the API has changed a little.  The
way to issue a discard request is now:
<p>
<pre>
    int blkdev_issue_discard(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t sector,
			     unsigned nr_sects);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>end_io()</tt> parameter seen in previous versions of the API is no
longer present.  There is no way for callers to know when the request
completes, or, indeed, if the request completes at all.  Since the caller
is indicating a lack of interest in the given sectors, it really should not
matter what the device does thereafter.

</blockquote>
<p>
There is a filesystem-level function for creating discard requests:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline int sb_issue_discard(struct super_block *sb,
				       sector_t block, 
				       unsigned nr_blocks);
</pre>
<p>
Here, the interface is expecting block numbers using the filesystem block
size, rather than 512-byte sectors.
<p>
User-space programs can issue discard requests with the new
<tt>BLKDISCARD</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> call.  Needless to say, such
operations should be done with care; about the only logical user of this
<tt>ioctl()</tt> would be <tt>mkfs</tt> programs.

<p>
Block drivers which support discard requests will provide a suitable
function to the block layer:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef int (prepare_discard_fn) (struct request_queue *queue, 
    	    			      struct request *rq);

    void blk_queue_set_discard(struct request_queue *q, 
    	                       prepare_discard_fn *dfn);
</pre>
<p>
In the absence of a "prepare discard" function, discard requests for the
device will fail.
<p>

The block layer has also added a flag by which drivers can indicate that a
device is not rotating storage, and, thus, does not suffer from seek
delays.  By setting <tt>QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT</tt> (with
<tt>queue_flag_set()</tt> or <tt>queue_flag_set_unlocked()</tt>), a driver
tells the block layer that it is working with a solid state device.  I/O
schedulers can use that information to avoid plugging the queue - a useful
technique for combining requests to rotating storage devices, but a useless
operation when there is no seek penalty to avoid.
<p>
<h3>Request affinity</h3>
<p>
On large, multiprocessor systems, there can be a performance benefit to
ensuring that all processing of a block I/O request happens on the same
CPU.  In particular, data associated with a given request is most likely to
be found in the cache of the CPU which originated that request, so it makes
sense to perform the request postprocessing on that same CPU.  With 2.6.28,
sysfs entries for block devices will include an <tt>rq_affinity</tt> variable.
If it is set to a non-zero value, CPU affinity will be turned on for that
device.  According to the patch changelog, turning this feature on can
reduce system time by 20-40% on some benchmarks.

<p>
<h3>Timeout handling</h3>

<p>
Robust device drivers typically have to be written to handle cases where
devices fail to complete operations they have been instructed to do.  In a
few cases, higher-level code helps with this task; the networking layer,
for example, can track outgoing packets and let a driver know when a
transmit operation has taken too long.  In most other drivers, though, it's
up to the driver itself to notice when an operation seems to be taking too
long.
<p>
Like the network subsystem, the block layer manages queues of requested
operations.  As of 2.6.28 the block layer will, again like networking, have
a mechanism for notifying drivers about request timeouts; that, in turn,
will allow a bunch of timeout-related code to be removed from the lower
layers.  Timeout handling in the block layer can be more complex, though,
and the associated API reflects that complexity.
<p>
A block driver must register a function to handle timed-out requests:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef enum blk_eh_timer_return (rq_timed_out_fn)(struct request *);

    void blk_queue_rq_timed_out(struct request_queue *q, 
				rq_timed_out_fn *fn);
</pre>
<p>
The amount of time a request should be outstanding before timing out is set
up with:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_queue_rq_timeout(struct request_queue *q, 
    	 		      unsigned int timeout);
</pre>
<p>

The tracking of per-request timeouts is done within the block layer; the
timer for any individual request is started when that request is dispatched
to the driver by the I/O scheduler.  Should a request fail to complete
before the timeout period passes, the driver's timeout function will be
called with a pointer to the languishing request.  The driver then can do
one of three things:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Figure out that, in fact, the request was completed as expected, but 
     that completion had not been noticed by the driver.  A dropped
     interrupt could bring out such a situation, for example.  In this
     case, the driver returns <tt>BLK_EH_HANDLED</tt>, and the request will
     be marked as completed.
<p>
<li> Decide that the request needs more time, perhaps because it has been
     re-issued by the driver.  A <tt>BLK_EH_RESET_TIMER</tt> will start the
     timer again for this request.
<p>
<li> Punt and return <tt>BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED</tt>.  The block layer
     currently does nothing at all when it gets this return code; future plans
     appear to include aborting the request within the block layer when
     this return value is encountered.
</ul>
<p>
If things look bad, the driver may decide to abort any outstanding
requests, reset the device, and start over.  There are a couple of new
functions which can help with this task:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_abort_request(struct request *req);
    void blk_abort_queue(struct request_queue *q);
</pre>
<p>
These functions will abort the given request, or all requests on the queue,
as appropriate.  Part of that process involves calling the driver's timeout
handler for each aborted request.
<p>
<h3>Other changes in brief</h3>
<p>
Some other block-layer changes include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The handling of minor numbers has been changed, allowing disks
     to have an essentially unbounded number of partitions.  The cost of
     this change is that minor numbers may be attached to a different major
     number, and they might not all be contiguous; for this reason, drivers
     must set the <tt>GENHD_FL_EXT_DEVT</tt> flag before the extended
     numbers will be used.  See <a href="/Articles/290141/">this
     article</a> for more information on this change.
<p>
<li> The prototypes of <tt>blk_rq_map_user()</tt> and
     <tt>blk_rq_map_user_iov()</tt> have changed; there is now a
     <tt>gfp_mask</tt> parameter.  This allows these functions to be used
     in atomic context.
<p>
<li> <tt>kblockd_schedule_work()</tt> has an additional parameter
     specifying the relevant request queue.
<p>
<li> The new function <tt>bio_kmalloc()</tt> behaves much like
     <tt>bio_alloc()</tt>, but it does not use a mempool to guarantee
     allocations and can thus fail.
</ul>
<p>
It is, all told, one of the busier development cycles for the block layer
in recent times.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; A block driver must register a function to handle timed-out requests</font><br>
<p>
As of 2.6.31, if the rq_timed_out_fn field in the request_queue is set to NULL, then blk_add_timer() will not start the timer request when called from <br>
blk_start_request() in blk-core.c<br>
<p>
So not setting rq_timed_out_fn (i.e. not calling blk_queue_rq_timed_out()) seems the way to disable any timing for the requests in that queue.<br>

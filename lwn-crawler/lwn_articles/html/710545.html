As is the case with many other tasks, allocation of memory in the kernel is
rather more complex than it is in user space.  The APIs used for allocation
in the kernel have evolved over many years to reflect this complexity.  But a
highly evolved API is not necessarily an optimal one, and there have been
signs for years that the approach used in the kernel is not perfectly
suited to the task.  A set of patches under consideration now shows how
thinking has shifted in this area.
<p>
Memory-allocation complexity in the kernel is driven by constraints on what
the kernel can do in any given situation.  It is often the case, for
example, that the kernel is running in a context where it is not allowed to
block waiting for an event, so allocation requests must be satisfied
without acquiring any sleeping locks.  Sometimes a request should be given
access to the last-resort pools of memory; this is usually the case when
the request itself is part of the process of freeing more memory in a
system where memory is tight.  There can be constraints on where the
allocated memory must be located.  And so on.
<p>
The approach taken to track these constraints is to add a "GFP flags"
argument to every memory-allocation function.  So, for example, the
prototype of <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, used to allocate relatively small chunks
of memory, is:
<p>
<pre>
    void *kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> argument describes the constraints on the request.  A
value of <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> indicates that the request is running in
atomic context and cannot sleep, for example, while <tt>GFP_DMA32</tt>
says that the allocated memory must be placed in a physical location
reachable by devices limited to 32-bit DMA operations.
There is a long list of these flags; <tt>&lt;linux/gfp.h&gt;</tt> has the
whole set.
<p>
<h4>Two types of flags</h4>
<p>
The point of interest here is that some of these flags (like
<tt>GFP_DMA32</tt>) describe attributes of the needed memory — they
apply to a specific allocation request.  But others, like
<tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt>, instead describe the context in which the allocation
request is being made.  This context is often not known at the point where
the allocation function is called, since that often happens in low-level
code that can be invoked in many contexts.  So higher-level code must
inform the low-level code about the context in which it is running; this is
generally done by 
adding GFP-flags arguments to functions all the way up the call chain.  To
pick a random example, consider the function that submits a request to a
USB device:
<p>
<pre>
    int usb_submit_urb(struct urb *urb, gfp_t mem_flags);
</pre>
<p>
This relatively high-level function must track the given
<tt>mem_flags</tt> and pass them to any function it calls that might
allocate memory; it must also adjust the flags if its own context changes.  This
interface has been made to work for many years, but it is somewhat prone to
errors.  One could argue, as some have over the years, that it is
fundamentally wrong; information 
tracking the context in which a thread is running might be better attached
to the thread directly rather than dragged along through a chain of
function calls.
<p>
<h4>GFP_NOFS</h4>
<p>
One flag in particular that describes the calling context is
<tt>GFP_NOFS</tt>, which instructs the memory allocator to avoid calling
into any filesystem code.  In particular, that means that the allocator
cannot start writeback on dirty pages to make more memory available.  There
are (at least) a couple of reasons to impose this constraint.  One is that
the allocation call itself is coming from filesystem code; in that case,
calling back into the filesystem risks deadlocking the system.  The other
is that adding filesystem calls to a lengthy call chain could overflow the
kernel stack, an outcome cherished by attackers but otherwise unloved by
Linux users.
<p>
Given those possibilities, it is unsurprising that kernel developers have
tended to take a "better safe than sorry" approach to the <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt>
flag; as a result, that flag appears in a great many allocation calls — a
quick grep shows over 1,300 instances in the 4.10-rc2 kernel.  At
the Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management summit in April 2016,
Michal Hocko <a href="/Articles/684437/">called out</a> use of this flag
as a problem.  It appears in many places where it is not really needed,
unnecessarily constraining what the memory-management code can do and, as a
result, worsening system performance.  He suggested that this flag should
be phased out in favor of a flag in the task structure that could be used
to accurately track the allocation context.
<p>
More recently, he has <a href="/Articles/709356/">proposed a new API</a>
that implements these changes.  A new flag (<tt>PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS</tt>) is
defined for the <tt>flags</tt> field of the <tt>task_struct</tt>
structure.  Then, whenever a thread enters a context where filesystem calls
should not be made, it should call:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int memalloc_nofs_save(void);
</pre>
<p>
This call will set the <tt>PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS</tt> flag and pass the
previous <tt>flags</tt> value back as its return value.  Exiting from the
"no filesystem calls" context is done with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void memalloc_nofs_restore(unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> value passed in should be the value returned from
<tt>memalloc_nofs_save()</tt>.
<p>
Between the two above calls, all memory-allocation requests executed in the
current thread will behave as if the <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> flag had been
passed, regardless of whether it is actually present or not.  Since each
caller saves the previous context, these calls can be nested to any level
and the right thing will happen.  For now, the <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> flag
remains (there is the matter of those 1,300 users, after all), but one can
see its eventual removal in the cards.  The patch set begins that process
by fixing some callers in the XFS and ext4 filesystem code.  The resulting
code should be clearer, and it eliminates the chance of a stray allocation
calling into the filesystem code in the wrong place.
<p>
Developers familiar with the memory-management code may think that this
interface looks familiar.  Indeed, it is inspired by a set of already
existing functions:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int memalloc_noio_save(void);
    void memalloc_noio_restore(unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
These functions were <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/21caf2fc1931b485483ddd254b634fa8f0099963">added
to the 3.9 kernel</a> in 2013 by Ming Lei; they move the <tt>GFP_NOIO</tt>
flag (which inhibits the initiation of I/O operations) into the task
structure in the same way.
<p>
The memory-allocation interface is, thus, clearly evolving in a direction
where context-related information is stored with the rest of the thread's
context rather than being passed through function arguments.  This
evolution can only be described as a slow process, though; there are nine
<tt>memalloc_noio_save()</tt> calls in the 4.10-rc2 kernel, compared to
nearly 500 uses of <tt>GFP_NOIO</tt>.  Increasing the pace of change may be
hard, though; switching to the new API requires a fairly deep understanding
of the code involved and cannot be done with a simple script.
<p>
One could imagine taking this work further by, for example, tracking atomic
context explicitly.  But that is work for the future; completing the task
for <tt>GFP_NOIO</tt> and <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> should arguably be done first.
Once all that is done, the kernel's memory-allocation API may better match
the uses to which it is put.  Given that we have only had 25 years to work
on it so far, it is not entirely surprising that we have not gotten there
yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I've had occasion to think about GFP_NOFS over the last week, and I think there's a simpler solution to removing it.  Rather than setting/clearing a per-process flag like Michael's proposal, why not a per-superblock flag?  A filesystem would set the SUPER_NO_RECLAIM flag when starting a transaction, and clear it after ending the transaction.  Upon entry to the shrinker, check to see if SUPER_NO_RECLAIM is set, and if it is, return SHRINK_STOP.<br>
<p>
This seems too obvious for everybody else to have missed, so what's the problem with this?<br>
<p>
(It also allows one filesystem to shrink in order to make space for an unrelated filesystem to make progress.  And filesystems can migrate to it on an individual basis; no giant flag day)<br>

You're right; we need to limit recursion. The current GFP_NOFS is a rather blunt instrument and I think we can do better.<br>
<p>
It's reasonable for each shrinker to estimate how much stack it's likely to consume to free memory. If we have a function that returns how much stack is still available, a shrinker can know whether to try to free memory or to fail.<br>

      speaking from personal experience, the downside of having a flag handled the proposed way is making much more difficult future changes to GPF_NOFS behaviour.
The current approach, cumbersome as it is, makes all uses of GPF_NOFS explicit, so one can know if a particular allocation has the flag set or not.
With an external flag, this is much more difficult to determine, because one needs to look not only at all the call chains leading to the allocation, but also at all the possible histories of the thread.

<p>
In principle all the functions that set the flag should also clear it before returning, so the thread flag follows the same "dynamic scope" as the current flag arguments. The history of the thread should not be a factor, apart from the call stack. Of course it's possible to get this protocol wrong, but provided the flag is used as intended I don't see how checking for a GPF_NOFS argument and following the call tree down to the allocation site is simpler or easier than checking for and similarly tracing any calls which occur between memalloc_nofs_save() and memalloc_nofs_restore().<br>

Actually, in principle there's no difference between passing the flag up the call chain or setting it in the task struct – you need to check all caller chains in both cases.<br>
<p>
The advantages of a per-task flag are that (a) you don't need the stupid function parameter everywhere, resulting in a (very small) speed-up and somewhat more readable code, and (b) you don't miss calls where it'd be reqired.<br>

Why isn't some sort of lock used? The memory allocator would try to acquire it and step back in case it can't, without sleeping or spinning at all. Conveying the lack of availability of a resource seems like a legitimate use case.<br>

      <P>Do you run into multiprocessor scalability concerns here?  I'm asking because I really don't know the answer.</P>
<P>Specifically:  Suppose you're in a call chain that wants <TT>GFP_NOFS</TT> for some reason.  If you prefer to represent this with a lock, you want the lock local to the CPU running that call chain to avoid cache-line ping/contention penalties among the CPUs.  This suggests a per-CPU lock, then.  However, since it's not <TT>GFP_ATOMIC</TT>, presumably that context can still sleep.  Is it possible that it wakes up on another CPU?  If the lock was per-CPU, you'd be in trouble.</P>
<P>Forgive me if that's a silly question, as I'll freely admit I'm not fully steeped in all the semantics of these flags.  If it is indeed the case that a thread could move among CPUs within one of these <TT>GFP_xx</TT> contexts, then it does seem like putting it in <TT>task_struct</TT> is exactly the right place.  That is, this context really is a property of the call chain and task state, and should follow it where it goes.</P>

Agreed. Other fav, the last sentence: "Given that we have only had 25 years to work on it so far, it is not entirely surprising that we have not gotten there yet."<br>

Actually direct reclaim does not initiate writeback for some time already (regardless of flags), only kswapd does that. But there's still a releasepage() callback to filesystem that could potentially deadlock. And IIRC also shrinkers.<br>
<p>
Then in addition to reclaim the might be direct compaction where migrating pages involves another fs callback. Until recently, compaction didn't run at all in nofs context, now it just skips over fs pages.<br>

Such kinds of API make source code hard to understand a bit more, e.g. if we need to know what are actual GFP parameters, we must find out all possible callers. It works like some kinds of global variables.<br>

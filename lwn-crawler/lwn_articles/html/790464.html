<p>The Intel architecture allows misaligned memory access in situations
where other architectures (such as ARM or RISC-V) do not. One such
situation is atomic operations on memory that is split across two cache
lines. This feature is largely unknown, but its impact is even less so.  It
turns out that the performance and security impact can be significant,
breaking realtime applications or allowing a rogue application to slow the
system as a whole. Recently, Fenghua Yu has been working on detecting and
fixing these issues in the <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/1556134382-58814-1-git-send-email-fenghua.yu%40intel.com/">split-lock
patch set</a>, which is currently on its eighth revision.</p>

<h4>From misaligned memory accesses to split locks</h4>

<p>Misaligned memory access occurs when the processor accesses memory at an
address that not aligned to the type of the operand, such as an eight-byte
operation that accesses a four-byte-aligned variable.
Reading four bytes from address <tt>0x1008</tt> is
aligned, for example, while the same operation from <tt>0x1006</tt> is not.
Misaligned accesses can cause varying behavior on different
architectures, including correct and performant operation, exceptions that stop
the processor, or incorrect results.

<p>
Misaligned accesses may incur a performance penalty
even if the processor transparently handles them.
For example, a misaligned access may be  split by the CPU
into two separate memory operations. Another possibility is the processor
generating an exception that is silently handled by the kernel.
Portable and high-performance applications should avoid
misaligned accesses; the kernel's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt">code 
guidelines</a> state that developers should assume natural alignment requirements
on all platforms.</p>

<p>A special type of a misaligned access is one that crosses two
cache lines, possibly causing the processor to have to fetch multiple lines
before performing the operation.  Things get more complicated when an
atomic operation is being performed and the processor must ensure that the
data involved is seen consistently and correctly while the operation is
executed.  Intel platforms support
atomic accesses that are split across two cache lines; such an operation is
called a "split lock".</p>

<p>With a split lock, the value needs to be kept coherent between different
CPUs, which means assuring that the two cache lines change together.
As this is an uncommon operation, the hardware design needs to take
a special path; as a result, split locks may have important consequences as
described in the cover letter of Yu's patch set. Intel's choice was to
lock the whole memory bus to solve the coherency problem; the processor
locks the bus for the duration of the operation, meaning that no
other CPUs or devices can access it. The split lock blocks not
only the CPU performing the access, but also all others in the system.
Configuring the bus-locking protocol itself also adds significant overhead to the
system as a whole.

<p>On the other hand, if the atomic operation operand fits into a single
cache line, the processor will use a less expensive cache lock. This all means
that developers may increase performance and avoid split locks by
actions like simply correctly aligning their variables.</p>

<h4>Split lock consequences</h4>

<p>Yu explained the use cases that motivated this work: hard
realtime, cloud computing, and avoiding a security hole.
The most important one seems to be related to systems
that run hard realtime applications on some cores and normal-priority
processes on other cores.  Split locks may cause the hard realtime
requirements to be broken, as 
the bus locking caused by split locks executed by the regular code blocks
memory accesses by the realtime code. Yu noted that, until now,
such complex realtime applications could not be supported for exactly this
reason:
<div class="BigQuote">
To date the designers have been unable to deploy these solutions as they
have no way to prevent the "untrusted" user code from generating split lock
and bus lock to block the hard real time code to access memory during bus
locking.
</div>
</p>

<p>In the cloud case, one user process from a guest system may block other
cores from accessing memory and cause performance degradation across
the whole system. In a similar way, malicious code may try to slow down the
system deliberately in a denial-of-service attack.</p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>

<p>Intel processors, starting with the upcoming Tremont generation, will be able to
generate an exception (called "Alignment Check" or
<tt>#AC</tt>) when a split lock is detected. Earlier processors support only
an event counter for debugging purposes (exposed by an event counter called
<tt>sq_misc.split_lock</tt> in perf), but do not allow immediate action
from the system. Yu's work is based on this new capability.</p>

<p>The correct response to split locks, including what to do when they
are detected while the system firmware is running, was the subject of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/6fbff2df-96c9-db51-371b-a23d1a84d070@intel.com/">some
discussion</a> during the review of the earlier version of the patch
set. The implementation in the current version concentrates on 
detection of the problem.</p>

<p>If a split-lock event happens in the kernel itself, it issues a warning and
disables the detection on the current CPU. After the warning, the faulty
instruction will execute and the system will continue ‚Äî whether the system
should go on or panic was one of the main topics of discussion.
The rationale is that a
split lock in the kernel is a bug and should be fixed, but the bug is not
so severe that the kernel should be made to panic.
<p>
The situation is different for user processes,
which will be sent a fatal (by default) <tt>SIGBUS</tt> signal. The issue
will need to be 
fixed before that program can run successfully.  Something similar happens
when a split lock is created by the system's
firmware: the system will simply hang at that point.  The developers
decided on this handling because they were afraid that otherwise <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1806221125240.2402@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">the
firmware would never be fixed</a>.</p>

<p>Split-lock detection is enabled by default when it is supported by the
hardware.  However, system administrators have control over the feature:
they can use a new kernel parameter (<tt>nosplit_lock_detect</tt>) at boot
time to disable it.  There is also a sysfs interface to disable it at
runtime  at <tt>/sys/devices/system/cpu/split_lock_detect</tt>.

<p>The patch set also includes support for KVM; it emulates the register in
guests, exposing the property. The host system will have the feature
enabled by default. What to do with the guests was discussed at multiple
occasions; the <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1904280903520.1757@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">agreed-on
solution</a> that will show up in the next iteration is to enable it in
guests when the host kernel has it enabled. It means that if the host
kernel has split-lock detection enabled and a guest triggers the exception,
it will be stopped. On the other hand, if the host kernel has it disabled,
the guest may choose to enable and use it, but is not required to.</p>

<h4>Further work</h4>

<p>The work has been through multiple iterations at this point and has
received regular comments from the kernel developers, including Thomas
Gleixner and Ingo Molnar. It has still some issues pending, but at the
current pace it should show up in the mainline kernel before too long.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Intel calls these "data chunk split misaligned" loads and stores. When they occur, the (e.g.) load buffer will hold them until the ROB indicates that the execution results would be committable to architectural state. There's a couple of fun patents if you search "data chunk split misaligned" in your favorite search engine.<br>

They are not talking about "normal" memory accesses.  The fun seems to happen on unaligned "atomic" accesses.  IIRC, ARM does not allow for cache line splitting on atomic operations nor  on load-exclusive/store-exclusive.<br>

It&#x27;s not that simple.<br>
<p>
arm can handle unaligned accesses on regular ldr and str instructions (and I think also ldrh and strh but i&#x27;m not 100% sure on that) since armv6. There are other instructions the hardware can&#x27;t handle unaligned accesses on though (ldrd and vldr spring to mind as ones I&#x27;ve had trouble with in real code). Some of these will be emulated by 32-bit kernels but not by 64-bit kernels leading to programs crashing when run on 64-bit kernels.<br>
<p>
While I haven&#x27;t checked I certainly wouldn&#x27;t expect fancy stuff like atomics to properly support unaligned access on arm.<br>

Unaligned access on arm is a horrible mess.<br>
<p>
On modern arm32, regular loads and stores are unaligned safe, but many other instructions (notably ldrd and vldr) are not. 32-bit kernels will trap and emulate unaligned accesses by default, but 64-bit kernels running 32-bit applications will not.<br>

You could get a deadlock pretty easily this way, and that's one thing that hardware engineers are going to be very careful to try and avoid. Imagine processor 1 has virtual address 0xA0000 mapped to physical address 0x1000 and 0xA1000 mapped to 0x2000, while processor 2 has 0xA0000 mapped to 0x2000 and 0xA1000 mapped to 0x1000. Now say that both do a 4-byte atomic operation to 0xA0FFF at about the same time. This is equivalent to the "Dining Philosophers Problem" for n=2 which requires a good amount of complexity to do safely.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The Intel architecture allows misaligned memory access in situations where other architectures (such as ARM or RISC-V) do not. One such situation is atomic operations on memory that is split across two cache lines. This feature is largely unknown, but its impact is even less so.</font><br>
<p>
Does anybody have any insight why support for such "split" atomic accesses was added? Seems like it's an obvious source of complexity - without IMO having a lot of practical benefit? Allowing un-aligned memory accesses is certainly useful for some work, but I don't quite see that being necessary for atomic operations?<br>

Because back in the 386 (and earlier) days there was no cache and atomic operations were done by literally locking the whole bus, so for the processor it was simpler not to do any check on the alignment after all it did not do any check on non-locked accesses). And when a cache was added, backwards compatibility meant you couldn't drop the feature.<br>

This is actually bad advice, here‚Äôs my suggestion for improvement,<br>
and why this is important:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; When writing code, assume the target architecture has natural alignment</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; requirements, but be prepared for less alignment.</font><br>
<p>
On m68k, even dword (32-bit) quantities are only aligned for 16 bits,<br>
and there has been software that implicitly relies on the implicit<br>
padding added by natural-alignment architectures if you have a<br>
struct { short; int; }; which is not added on m68k.<br>
<p>
We‚Äôve been fixing some of them by changing some assertions (against<br>
accidental struct growth) from sizeof(struct) == value to &lt;= value,<br>
but the proper fix is to make all struct padding explicit by adding<br>
explicitly unused members to the structures. This also helps visua‚Äê<br>
lising the problems of uninitialised padding when comparing them.<br>
<p>
I‚Äôd appreciate if someone with experuence in the LKML community<br>
could pick this up and discuss and fix it there.<br>

Yes! I‚Äôve significantly reduced the in-memory size of several structures (which are then used in arrays, which pads them to powers of 2 at the end too, so going down from 36 to 32 actually reduces from 64 to 32) in some codebasƒìs.<br>

If the arrays are dynamically allocated, slab allocator (for example) might do this.  I once looked at a case that was allocating a bunch of individual pointers that all got rounded up from 8 to 32 bytes, meaning 75% of each allocation was unused.  It makes sense that the allocators work that way, but if you don't know that and do this sort of thing hundreds of times, and especially if the memory being allocated happens to be something like 2**n + small_amount, you can accidentally waste a lot of memory. <br>

The typical userland allocators on Solaris &amp; Windows also behave this way. It's not very surprising.<br>
<p>
On Linux my memory is a bit muddied between the default glibc allocator, tcmalloc, jemalloc etc. so I'm less confident, but I would expect the same.<br>

<p>
Yes, this is the rule you have to follow when designing a data structure to be exchanged between kernel and userspace (or between kernel and firmware/hardware) so that the structure as a fixed size regarding the architecture (and padding can be initialized and/or inspected for unknown bit set).<br>

Is there any support for GDB to be able to pause on these?  I have some code apparently that needs alignment, but I don't know where; most structures are typically aligned so setting the break on the exchange will catch thousands of operations otherwise.   Is there a signal generated?  when I do a search for 'split lock detection gdb' I get articles about one or the other, but not both topics together.<br>

      <p>The easiest way to catch these is to boot with <tt>split_lock_detect=fatal</tt>; then the kernel will send your process a SIGBUS signal every time you get it wrong. You can then use <tt>catch signal SIGBUS</tt> or <tt>handle signal SIGBUS stop</tt> to get GDB to take control whenever you get a SIGBUS, and your normal tools to debug the program. Note that <tt>catch signal SIGBUS</tt> sets a catchpoint, which can have all your usual nice tools for working with breakpoints applied to it (e.g. <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Break-Commands.html#Break-Commands">automatic commands run</a> when you hit the catchpoint, or <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Conditions.html#Conditions">conditional behaviour</a> such as continuing anyway for a SIGBUS that isn't related to a split lock.

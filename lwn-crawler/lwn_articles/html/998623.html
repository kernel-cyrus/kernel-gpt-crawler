As of this writing, just over 1,800 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline kernel for the 6.13 release.  That number may seem small,
given that a typical merge window brings in at least 12,000 commits, but
the early pulls this time around have focused on significant core changes,
and there are quite a few of them.  The time has come to summarize the
changes pulled so far, including lazy preemption, multi-grained timestamps,
new extended-attribute system calls, and more.
<p>
Some of the most significant changes pulled in the first part of the 6.13
merge window include:
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The arm64 architecture can now run Linux in virtual machines under
     the <a
     href="https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture">Arm
     Confidential Compute Architecture</a>.
<li> Arm64 also now supports user-space shadow stacks with the <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/arch/arm64/gcs.html">Guarded
     Control Stack</a> feature.
<li> The s390 architecture has gained support for the resizing of virtual
     machines with <a href="https://virtio-mem.gitlab.io/">virtio-mem</a>.
     There is an overview in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/38968bcdcc1d">this commit
     message</a>. 
<li> <a href="/Articles/911219/">Split-lock detection</a> is now supported
     on AMD CPUs.
<li> There is now <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/322a90638768">support</a> for MIPS
     multi-cluster interrupt controllers.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/992991/"><tt>PIDFD_GET_INFO</tt>
     <tt>ioctl()</tt> operation</a>, which will fetch information about a
     process represented by a pidfd, has been merged.
<li> The io_uring subsystem has a new command,
     <tt>IORING_REGISTER_RESIZE_RINGS</tt>, that allows on-the-fly resizing
     of the submission and completion rings.  This allows applications to
     start with a pair of relatively small rings, and grow them later should
     the need arise.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/994322/">lazy preemption</a> patches have been
     merged.  This work greatly simplifies the kernel's preemption logic
     (and configuration options) while maintaining performance for
     throughput-oriented configurations.  It is a significant change that
     should, eventually, reduce the amount of scheduling-related logic
     scattered through the non-scheduler parts of the kernel.
<li> Some preliminary work needed to implement <a
     href="/Articles/953438/">proxy execution</a>, an improved approach to
     the avoidance of priority inversion, has been merged.  The proxy
     execution feature itself, though, has not yet landed.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There have been a few tries to implement fine-grained timestamps
     for file metadata; the last one <a href="/Articles/946394/">ran
     aground</a> at the end of 2023.  Another attempt is being made for
     6.13; <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6ac81fd55e8a">this merge
     message</a> contains the details of how it works.
     <p>
     In short: as before, filesystems only need to track fine-grained
     change times for a given file if the time is being actively queried;
     most of the time, low-resolution timestamps are good enough.  That is
     important, since lower-resolution timestamps do not need to be written
     back to persistent storage as frequently.  The previous implementation
     ran into problems, though, where a low-resolution timestamp could
     appear to be earlier than a high-resolution timestamp, even though the
     actual changes happened in the opposite order.
     <p>
     In the
     new implementation, the kernel remembers the last fine-grained
     timestamp that was given out and ensures that any coarse-grained
     timestamps assigned for file modifications are later than the that
     last fine-grained value.  This technique avoids the above-mentioned
     problem, ensuring that timestamps always correctly reflect the order
     in which files were modified.
     <p>
     See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e3fad0376d80">this
     documentation commit</a> for more information.
<li> There is a new sysctl knob, <tt>fs.dentry-negative</tt>, that controls
     whether the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer deletes a file's kernel-internal
     directory entry ("dentry") when the file itself is deleted.  It seems
     that some benchmarks do better when dentries are removed, while others
     benefit from having a negative dentry left behind, so the kernel
     developers have put the decision into the system administrator's
     hands.  The default value (zero) means that dentries are not
     automatically deleted, matching the behavior of previous kernels.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/950569/"><tt>statmount()</tt></a> system call
     has gained options to return the filesystem subtype, superblock
     source, and security mount options.  There is also a new flag,
     <tt>STATMOUNT_OPT_ARRAY</tt>, that returns filesystem options as a
     series of NUL-separated strings and without the usual "<tt>\000</tt>"
     escaping.
<li> There have been some deep reference-counting changes within the VFS
     layer that yield a 3-5% performance improvement on highly threaded
     workloads; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/62eec753cae2">this merge
     message</a> for some details.
<li> It is now possible to assemble an <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">overlayfs</a>
     stack using file descriptors rather than path names; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a29835c9d0ba">this merge
     message</a> for details.
<li> The tmpfs filesystem can now be mounted in a case-folding mode
     where file names are no longer case-sensitive.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a713f830c903">this documentation
     commit</a> for the relevant mount options.
<li> Limited support for <a href="/Articles/974578/">atomic write
     operations</a> has been added to the ext4 and XFS filesystems.  
<li> There is a new set of system calls for the management of extended
     attributes: <tt>setxattrat()</tt>,  <tt>getxattrat()</tt>,
     <tt>listxattrat()</tt>, and <tt>removexattrat()</tt>.  They are
     variants of <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setxattr.2.html"><tt>setxattr()</tt></a>,
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getxattr.2.html"><tt>getxattr()</tt></a>,
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listxattr.2.html"><tt>listxattr()</tt></a>,
     and <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/removexattr.2.html"><tt>removexattr()</tt></a>
     that include a directory file descriptor as the starting point for the
     path-name search.
<li> The new <tt>BTRFS_IOC_SUBVOL_SYNC_WAIT</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
     for the Btrfs filesystem will wait for the cleaning of one or more
     subvolumes.  It is an unprivileged operation, and is intended to allow
     the "<tt>btrfs subvolume sync</tt>" command to work without privilege. 
<li> Btrfs now supports performing encoded reads (reading of compressed
     extents directly, without decompression) via io_uring.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     Renesas ISL28022 power monitors and
     Nuvoton NCT7363Y fan controllers.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Marvell PEM performance-monitoring units,
     Airoha true HW random number generators,
     Broadcom BCM74110 random number generators,
     Renesas RZ/V2H(P) interrupt control units, and
     THEAD C9XX ACLINT S-mode IPI interrupt controllers.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new user-space API allowing administrators to set thermal
     thresholds on specific devices; notifications will be generated when a
     threshold is crossed.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/445936f9e258">This commit</a> gives
     an overview of the functionality, but the actual (netlink-based) API
     is uncompromisingly undocumented.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The SELinux security module can now manage policies for individual
     netlink operations; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d1d991efaf34">this commit
     message</a> for a terse overview.
<li> The <tt>/sys/fs/selinux/user</tt> configuration knob <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d7b6918e22c7">has been
     deprecated</a> and will be removed in a future release.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There are now Rust abstractions for a number of VFS data structures
     and interfaces — enough to support the <a
     href="/Articles/953116/">Rust implementation of binder</a>.
<li> The bulk of the <a href="/Articles/985853/">file-descriptor
     memory-safety work</a> has been merged. 
<li> The kernel's cryptographic subsystem has gained a new internal API
     for signature generation.  There is <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/crypto/api-sig.html#asymmetric-signature-api">some
     kerneldoc documentation</a> available.
<li> There is a new variant of the sleepable RCU ("SRCU") API that makes
     the read side cheaper at the cost of more expensive write operations.
     Documentation for the new functions — <tt>srcu_read_lock_lite()</tt>
     and <tt>srcu_read_unlock_lite()</tt> — can be found by reading through
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6364dd8191d2">this commit</a>.
<li> The <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/debug-objects.html">debugobjects
     subsystem</a> has been massively reworked for better performance and
     robustness; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb1dd1403c7b">this merge
     message</a> for details.
<li> The venerable <tt>dontdiff</tt> file <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b27f9e8079bf">has been removed</a>
     from the documentation tree.
</ul>
<p>
The 6.13 merge window can be expected to remain open through
December&nbsp;1.  That closing date is immediately after a significant
holiday weekend in the US, but past experience suggests that the 6.13-rc1
release will come out on schedule regardless.  LWN will have an update of
the remaining changes from this merge window once it closes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder if it would make sense to add a flag to unlinkat, which lets userspace indicate on a case-by-case basis whether the removed file is likely to be looked for again or not? Userspace is in a great position to know whether a filename is likely to be looked for again or not.<br>

      <blockquote> The kernel's cryptographic subsystem has gained a new internal API for signature generation. There is some kerneldoc documentation available.</blockquote>

<p>Author here. More accurately the goal of my patches was to move sign/verify operations out of akcipher and into a new, separate crypto algorithm type. akcipher is thus now solely for asymmetric encrypt/decrypt. Of note here is that the new sign/verify API uses kernel buffers, whereas akcipher uses sglists.

<p>Herbert Xu started the transition to the new crypto algorithm type for sign/verify a year ago by introducing a frontend:

<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/ZIg4b8kAeW7x%2FoM1@gondor.apana.org.au/">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/ZIg4b8kAeW7x%2FoM1@gondor.apana.org.au/</a>

<p>I completed that effort by adding a backend and migrating all asymmetric sign/verify algorithms to it:

<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1725972333.git.lukas@wunner.de/">https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1725972333.git.lukas@wunner.de/</a>

<p>We currently have 3 algorithms in the tree: RSA (only PKCS1 encoding), ECDSA (X9.62 encoding and from v6.13 also P1363) and ECRDSA (aka GOST). Signing is currently only supported by the RSA algorithm implementation. Verifying by all three.

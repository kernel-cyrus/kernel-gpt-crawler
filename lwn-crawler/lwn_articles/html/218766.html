<div class="ArticleText">
Linux cannot be said to suffer from a shortage of virtualization
solutions.  What is harder to come by, however, is a paravirtualization
system which is amenable to relatively easy understanding.  A relatively
recent entrant into the field, however, changes that situation
significantly.  With just 6,000 lines (including the user-space code),
Rusty Russell's hypervisor 
implementation, <a href="http://lguest.ozlabs.org/">lguest</a>
(pronounced <tt>r&#652;s.ti'vai.z&#601;r</tt>), provides a
full, if spartan paravirtualization mechanism for Linux.
<p>

The core of lguest is the <tt>lg</tt> loadable module.  At initialization
time, this module allocates a chunk of memory and maps it into the kernel's
address space just above the vmalloc area - at the top, in other words.  A
small hypervisor is loaded into this area; it's a bit of assembly code
which mainly concerns itself with switching between the kernel and the
virtualized guest.  Switching involves playing with the page tables - what
looks like virtual memory to the host kernel is physical memory to the
guest - and managing register contents.
<p>

The hypervisor will be present in the guest systems' virtual address spaces
as well.  Allowing a guest to modify the hypervisor would be bad news,
however, as that would enable the guest to escape its virtual sandbox.
Since the guest kernel will run in ring&nbsp;1, normal i386 page protection
won't keep it from messing with the hypervisor code.  So, instead, the
venerable segmentation mechanism is used to keep that code out of reach.
<p>

The <tt>lg</tt> module also implements the basics for a virtualized I/O
subsystem.  At the lowest level, there is a "DMA" mechanism which really
just copies memory between buffers.  A DMA buffer can be bound to a given
address; an attempt to perform DMA to that address then copies the memory
into the buffer.  The DMA areas can be in memory which is shared between
guests, in which case the data will be copied from one guest to another and
the receiving guest will get an interrupt; this is how inter-guest
networking is implemented.  If no shared DMA area is found, DMA transfers
are, instead, referred to the user-space hypervisor (described below) for
execution.  Simple disk and console drivers exist as well.

<p>
Finally, the <tt>lg</tt> module implements a controlling interface accessed
via <tt>/proc/lguest</tt> - a feature which might just have to be changed
before lguest goes into the mainline.  The user-space hypervisor creates a
guest by writing an "initialize" command to this file, specifying the
memory range to use, where to find the kernel, etc.  This interface can
also be used to receive and execute DMA operations and send interrupts to
the guest system.  Interestingly, the way to actually cause the guest to
run is to read from the control file; execution will continue until the
guest blocks on something requiring user-space attention.


<p>
Also on the kernel side is a <tt><a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194543/">paravirt_ops</a></tt> implementation
for working with the lguest hypervisor; it must be built into any
kernel which will be run as a guest.  At system initialization time, this
code looks for a special signature left by the hypervisor at guest startup;
if the signature is present, it means the kernel is running under lguest.
In that situation, the lguest-specific <tt>paravirt_ops</tt> will be
installed, enabling the kernel to run properly as a guest.
<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/lguest.png" width=182 height=372 border=0
hspace=3 alt="[lguest address spaces]" align="right">

The last component of the system is the user-mode hypervisor client.  Its job is
to allocate a range of memory which will become the guest's "physical"
memory; the guest's kernel image is then mapped into that memory range.
The client code itself has been specially linked to sit high in the virtual
address space, leaving room for the guest system below.  Once that guest
system is in place, the user-mode client performs its read on the control
file, causing the guest to boot.
<p>
A
file on the host system can become a disk image for the guest, with the
user-mode client handling the "DMA" requests to move blocks back and forth.
Network devices can be set up to perform communication between guests.  The
<tt>lg</tt> network driver can also work in a loopback mode, connecting an
internal network device to a TAP device configured on the host; in this
way, guests can bind to ports and run servers.
<p>

With sufficient imagination, how all of this comes together can be seen in
the diagram to the right.  The lguest client starts the process, running in
user space on the host.  It allocates the memory indicated by the blue box,
which is to become the guest's virtualized physical memory, then maps in
the guest kernel.  Once the user-mode client reads from
<tt>/proc/lguest</tt>, the page tables and segment descriptors are tweaked
to make the blue box seem like the entire system, and control is passed to
the guest kernel.  The guest can request some services via the kernel-space
hypervisor code; for everything else, control is returned to the user-mode
client. 
<p>

That is a fairly complete description of what lguest can do.  There is no
Xen-style live migration, no UML-style copy-on-write disk devices, no
resource usage management beyond what the kernel already provides, etc.  As
Rusty put it at linux.conf.au, lguest eschews fancy features in favor of
cute pictures of puppies.  The simplicity of this code is certainly one of
its most attractive qualities; it is easy to understand and to play with.
It should have a rather easier path into the kernel than some of the other
hypervisor implementations out there.  Whether it can stay simple once
people start trying to do real work with it remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      ... Unless you're using target in a more militant sense then I don't see how the statement logically follows?<br>
<p>
Linux has too many virtualization models.  Factions of developers are experimenting and filling different virtualization niches.<br>
<p>
VMware is commercial, expensive, proprietary, and well established.  Full virtualization via some proprietary (and patented?) software techniques.  Adding support for para virtualization.  Fairly slick UI and provisioning tools.<br>
<p>
Xen is free. But separate (and widely criticized).  Supports para virtualized and full virtualization (with the latest CPU models). Nascent tools<br>
<p>
KVM is free ... and done by core kernel developer.  Thus it's integrated into the mainstream (but perhaps too new to have accumulated much criticism).  No tools nor UI t speak of --- KVM is more of an API and some other project(s) will have to form around that to build front end tools and UIs.  KVM seems to require the VT-x CPU features in any event.<br>
<p>
Virtuozzo and OpenVZ are very lightweight but essentially like a jazzed up "chroot" (or, more to the point, like the FreeBSD jail() system call).  It's well established for "consolidated server hosting."<br>
<p>
This lguest, as described here seems to be an experiment in minimalism.<br>
Interestingly it using the ancient 386 segmentation and additional "rings"<br>
as the basis for it's own paravirtualization abstraction.  I'm guessing<br>
it will be somewhere between Virtuozzo and KVM in the degree of<br>
isolation and virtualization that's achieved.<br>
<p>
So all of these other than VMWare sound like perfectly normal exploration of a range of possibilities.  I suspect that parts of these will be<br>
merged ... but that there will continue to be at least two or three diverse set of "virtualization" and "jail/chroot isolation" features that will<br>
be used in different ways.<br>
<p>
More importantly I hope that provisioning, package management, monitoring and related tools become "VM aware." in a large number of ways.  And that they can mostly abstract away the differences between Virtuozzo, Xen and other VM types.<br>

      Which is User-Mode Linux. On which I've run an incredibly reliable and low cost server doing a great number of things reliably for a couple of years. UML has been criticised for performance compared to Xen - but most servers only use a small fraction of CPU anyway. Don't notice the problem myself. Virtualisation has so much potential it's not surprising there is much work going on different approaches to it. On Linux it is also a young enough field we are all better served by finding out which solutions work best in which situations.<br>

      You miss the point of the lrustyguestvisor.  The answer to your question is that the performance doesn't matter because of the puppies.  Look at all the cute puppies!  Ahem...  He's quite a persuasive speaker, is our Rusty...<br>
<p>
A slightly more serious answer is that performance isn't the number one goal - it's not bad, but it's not going to be heavily tuned for performance if it makes things more complicated.  At this point, it's simple enough that I believe it doesn't do SMP yet, although support for an SMP host kernel has apparently just been added.<br>

<p>
Poor.  Last I did a guest kernel compile, it was twice as slow as running in the host (mind you, the guest only had 512M of ram, the host had 3G, so some can be explained away).<br>
<p>
That said, there are plenty of low hanging fruit left, and progress is being made quickly.  Balancing small code vs. performance is going to be the trick, but I'd hope to get within 25% of native on all reasonable benchmarks.  Of course, for some things it's there already, but context-switch-heavy loads really show the weakness of the shadow page table implementation, for example.<br>
<p>
I often put virtbench results into checkin comments, which you can see here:<br>

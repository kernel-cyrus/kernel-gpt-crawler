The Linux kernel deals extensively with SCSI devices, many of which have
interpretations of the SCSI standard that can accurately be described as
"interesting."  That leaves developers on both the kernel and device sides
of the bus looking for ways to verify that a specific hardware combination
is working correctly.  Lee Duncan led an LSFMM 2013
storage-track discussion on how SCSI testing might be improved.
<p>
Once upon a time, Lee was using a set of Python scripts aimed at testing
specific SCSI features, but then he stumbled across Ronnie Sahlberg's <a
href="https://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi">libiscsi library</a>, which has
a "very handy" test suite built into it.  Those tests cover a wide range of
behavior, including things like response to malformed SCSI commands and
various "edge cases."  This kind of testing is useful, he said, to help
determine whether a SCSI target is working correctly.  Lots of SCSI targets
are implemented in software and change frequently, so this is a question
that needs to be answered often.  His question was: is it possible to put
this kind of testing infrastructure into the kernel's SCSI layer, or,
failing that, to at least make this kind of testing easier?
<p>
There was some discussion about whether SCSI&nbsp;2 or SCSI&nbsp;3 testing
would be more useful.  James Bottomley stepped in to "set expectations,"
saying that a lot of devices lie about what version of the SCSI standard
they support.  Almost every USB device claims to support SCSI&nbsp;2, for
example, though few of them do, and a lot of SCSI&nbsp;2 devices
fraudulently claim SCSI&nbsp;3 compliance.  So the question, he said, is
somewhat irrelevant; in the real world, the lines between the various
standards are blurry at best.

James added that there are many heuristics in the SCSI stack which
are keyed off the SCSI version.  Martin Petersen said that it would be nice
if the test suite could replicate those heuristics.
<p>
There was wide agreement that a test suite would be useful; James said that
device manufacturers have asked for such a thing and said they would use it
if it were available.  So the discussion turned to the form that this test
suite would take.  James said at the outset that it could not be built on
top of <a href="http://www.open-iscsi.org/">Open-iSCSI</a>, because that
would make it impossible to test the initiator side of the bus.  Instead,
the suite should attach to the SG (SCSI generic) interface and send
commands via that path.
<p>
The set of commands sent to the device would need to be thought out a bit;
as James noted, there is no desire to actually destroy the device being
tested.  So the suite would send "sane" commands and verify that they work
properly.  Martin added that there is value in hitting a device with random
commands, but that's not what vendors are usually looking to test.
<p>
James said that there are other things that would be nice to test but, due
to lies from the device, are hard to test.  The classic example is a device
that includes a writeback cache to improve performance, but fails to
implement the commands associated with caching control.  Such devices have
a high risk of losing data.  This is a hard case to catch, though
sometimes that can be done through repeated write-and-power-off cycles.
There was also talk of testing devices with multiple paths to ensure that
commands issued in parallel are executed properly.
<p>
The session ended with a set of tasks to be carried out, starting with the
need to come up with a list of commands that should be exercised by the
test suite; these will then be built into a user-space suite.

The libiscsi testsuite is awesome indeed.  I used it to test QEMU and it found some bugs in the kernel's iSCSI target, too. :)<br>

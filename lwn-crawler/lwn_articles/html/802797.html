<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 21, 2019</br>
           </div>
When a kernel subsystem maintainer has a set of commits to send up the
chain toward the mainline, the <a
href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull"><tt>git request-pull</tt>
command</a>  is usually
the right tool for the job.  But various maintainers have noticed over the
years that this command can sometimes generate confusing results when
confronted with anything but the simplest of histories.  A brief
conversation on the linux-kernel mailing list delved into why this
situation comes about and what maintainers can do in response.
<p>
While <tt>git request-pull</tt> is  intended to be a general-purpose
command, it's no secret that its output is designed for the needs of one
specific consumer; it contains almost everything Linus Torvalds needs to
know when considering a request to pull a tree into the mainline kernel.
This information includes the commit upon which the tree is based, the
timestamp for the most recent commit in the tree, the tree to pull the
commits from, the maintainer's description of the changes, a list of
commits (in the <tt>git shortlog</tt> format), and a diffstat showing which
files will be touched.  See <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190709090611.66911ed5%40lwn.net/">a typical pull
request</a> to see how all of those elements are worked into a single
email.
<p>
That example is generated from a relatively straightforward development
history that looks something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/commits1.svg" alt="[commit stream]" width=400px
class="photo"> 
</blockquote>
<p>
Generating both the commit log and the diffstat for this history is
relatively straightforward, and the pull requests looks exactly as one
would expect.
<p>
Recently, Will Deacon <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191017234348.wcbbo2njexn7ixpk@willie-the-truck/">ran
into a more complex situation</a>, though.  His tree was initially based in
5.4-rc1, but then required a merge of 5.4-rc2 to obtain the dependencies
for a fix.  The history ended up looking something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/commits2.svg" alt="[commit stream 2]"
width=500px class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
When one runs <tt>git request-pull</tt> for a tree like this, the
commit-log portion will look exactly as expected — it contains the commits
in the local tree.  The diffstat, though, is likely to reflect a large
number of unrelated changes, making the pull request look like a scary
beast indeed.  In essence, that diffstat will reflect not just the local
changes, but also everything that was pulled into the local tree when 5.4-rc2
was merged.  That makes it hard, at best, to see what the pull request will
actually do.
<p>
Deacon was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191018174153.slpmkvsz45hb6cts@willie-the-truck/">surprised</a>
that the commit log was correct while the diffstat was wrong.  Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whmtB98b8=YL2b8HzPKRadk2A9pL0aasmvgebhePrDP9w@mail.gmail.com/">explained</a>
it this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So logs and diffs are fundamentally different.

<p>	A log is an operation on a _set_ of commits (that's the whole point
	- you don't list the beginning and the end, you list all the
	commits in between), while a diff is fundamentally an operation on
	two end-points and shows the code difference between those two
	points.
<p>
	And the summary versions of those operations (shortlog and diffstat)
	are no different.
</div>
<p>
He went on to say that, when there are only two endpoints and the history
is simple, it is not hard for a tool like Git to calculate the difference
between them.  Throwing another merge into the mix complicates the
situation, though, by adding another endpoint.  The end result is the
useless diffstat included in the pull request.
<p>
Deacon resolved the issue by merging the current mainline with the tree to
be pulled:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/commits3.svg" alt="[commit stream 3]"
width=550px class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
The diffstat could then be generated manually choosing the mainline and the
merged tree as the two endpoints; the only differences that will be visible
will be those that are not in the current mainline — the changes to be
pulled from Deacon's tree, in other words.  The clean diffstat was then manually 
patched into the pull request.  The merge itself can then be thrown
away; it should not be part of the commit stream sent upstream.  As
Torvalds explained, performing the merge reduced the diffstat problem back
to two simple endpoints, so the result became as one would expect.
<p>
Should maintainers perform this sort of dance before sending pull requests
upstream?  It seems that Torvalds appreciates the effort; he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjPZYxiTs3F0Vbrd3kRizJGq-rQ_jqH1+8XR9Ai_kBoXg@mail.gmail.com/">described</a>
the result as a "<q>good quality</q>" pull request.  He also noted,
though, that he often gets pull requests with confusing diffstats and
doesn't really have a hard time dealing with them.  Still, maintainers who
want to be sure that their pull requests are as pleasing to the recipient
as possible may want to go to the extra effort.
<p>
The best solution, of course, would be to fix <tt>git request-pull</tt> to
do the right thing in this sort of situation.  Depending on how complex the
merge history is, though, "the right thing" may not always be entirely
obvious.  It might also, like the merge described above, require changing
the repository, which the <tt>request-pull</tt> command does not currently
do.  But, as Ingo Molnar <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191021064658.GB22042@gmail.com/">noted</a>, it
should at least be possible for <tt>git request-pull</tt> to detect this
situation and issue a warning when it arises.  Then, at least, developers
would not be surprised by a bogus diffstat — something that can easily
happen immediately after having sent it upstream.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

You're in luck -- there's actually a document in Documentation/ that explains why this is a bad idea for maintainers[1]. There are two primary reasons:<br>
<p>
1. Maintainers' trees are public, and thus developers base their work on them. Rebasing a public tree causes trouble for downstreams.<br>
2. Rebasing a tree before you send it to Linus results in you sending untested patches (any previous tests run on your tree are invalid).<br>

It's possible that in many cases this could be fixed by addition of a single dot:<br>

Note that Linus has also said in the past he does not like the merge to mainline as the top of pull request, so if you generate a merge commit don't send it.<br>
<p>
Based on a conversation with Linus, what I do is to prepare two branches, one that has the unmerged tree, and one that has a merge commit to latest at the very top. The Pull Request is for the first tree, but the diffstat is replaced with the one from the second. The second is tagged something like 'for-linus-merged' and is mentioned in the PR if there were conflicts to resolve. I usually have minor conflicts.<br>
<p>
Linus explained he will use the -merged tag to compare any merge conflict resolutions he makes against the sender's version of those resolutions.<br>
<p>
You can't really 'fix' git pull-request because it doesn't have a merged base to do the diff against. Perhaps the best one could do is have it try to automerge and use that if there are no conflicts. Uwe provided an algorithm that does this later in the thread.<br>
<p>
The diagram in the article is not quite right. The key thing is that 'C2' was sent and merged by Linus into rc3, and then rc2 was merged on top of a commit that was logically in rc3. This 'going backwards' creates the problem.<br>
<p>
It could also have been avoided if rc3 was merged instead of rc2. ie don't merge older tags into your tree.<br>

I am always fascinated by this utility. It seems so full of opportunity and so little used outside of the kernel world. Did for example anybody managed to make an utility parsing its output in the gitlab issue report (hopefully from a repository on another site) and making a merge request out of it?<br>

      <p>It should be noted that this kind of situation has been known since a very long time and some commercial Git hosting providers do exactly the same dance to show a good diff, namely perform a merge and show that diff. See for example <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/a-better-pull-request/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I got used to seeing this kind of diff very quickly. If  <code>git request-pull</code> could automate this it would be great. However I do think this is easier in a centralized environment where every change to the mainline can automatically cause the pull request diff to be recompiled. </p>

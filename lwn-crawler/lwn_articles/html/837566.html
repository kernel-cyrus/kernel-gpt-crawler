           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 19, 2020</br>
           </div>
Almost every filesystem (excepting relics like VFAT) implements the concept
of the owner and group of each file; the higher levels of the operating
system then use that information to control access to those files.  For
decades, it has usually sufficed to track a single owner and group for each
file, but there is an increasing number of use cases wanting to make that
ownership relative to the environment any given process is running in.
Developers have been working for a few years to find solutions to this
problem; the latest attempt is the <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20201115103718.298186-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">ID-mapped
mounts patch set</a> from Christian Brauner.
<p>
In truth, the ID-mapping problem is not exactly new.  User and group IDs
for files only make sense across a management domain if there is a single
authority controlling the assignment of those IDs.  Since that is often not
the case, network filesystems like NFS have had the ability to remap IDs
for many years.  The growth of virtualization and container technologies
has brought the problem closer to home; there can be multiple management
domains running on a single machine.  The NFS ID-remapping mechanism is of
little use if NFS itself is not being used.
<p>
For example, container runtime systems may want to provide a common root
image to each container.  <a href="/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a>
may be used to ensure that each container is running with a set of
nonprivileged IDs on the host system, but those containers should be able
to access their root images with root privileges.  Mounting that image with
ID remapping would make this possible.  Similarly, ID remapping would make
it easier to share filesystems between containers regardless of the IDs in
use within each container.  Or consider <a
href="https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/">systemd-homed</a>, which provides
consistent access to a user's home directory across machines.  If a user
logs into a system and is given a user ID that doesn't match the ownership
of their home
directory, systemd-homed will change the ownership of all files in and
below the home directory â€” not an especially efficient operation.  ID
remapping would solve the problem in a more satisfying way.
<p>
There have been a number of previous attempts to address these use cases.  The <a
href="/Articles/718639/">shiftfs</a> filesystem was designed to be stacked on top of
an ordinary filesystem; it would then remap user and group IDs in
operations as they passed through.  That idea then evolved into <a
href="/Articles/809125/">shifting bind mounts</a>, which moved the
ID-mapping function into the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer.  Shortly after
that, Brauner proposed <a href="/Articles/812504/">FSID mappings</a>, which
repurposed the kernel's filesystem-ID abstraction to perform the
remapping.  Now, with ID-mapped mounts, the remapping is again handled
within the VFS, but with a twist.
<p>
This patch set adds a new pointer to the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.8/source/include/linux/mount.h#L70"><tt>vfsmount</tt></a>
structure that represents a mounted filesystem; this pointer, called
<tt>mnt_user_ns</tt>, points to a user namespace.  One of the key features
of user namespaces is, of course, ID remapping; a process that is running
within a user namespace will already have its user and group IDs remapped
for any operation, including filesystem operations, that reaches outside of
the namespace.  But user namespaces have a single map that applies to all
operations, and to all mounted filesystems; attaching a user namespace to
the <tt>vfsmount</tt> structure allows every mounted filesystem to have a
different mapping.
<p>
Setting up ID-mapped mounts, thus, involves the creation of user namespaces
to contain the ID-mapping tables.  These user namespaces will, most likely,
never have processes running within them; in a sense, much of their
functionality is wasted in this context.  But this approach made it
possible to use all of the existing ID-mapping helpers, while creating a
more focused ID-mapping abstraction would require duplicating much of that
functionality.
<p>
By default, mounted filesystems will point to the initial user namespace,
which is taken as an indication that no remapping is to be done at that
layer.  Code that wants to add ID mapping to a mounted filesystem has to
start by creating a new user namespace; this is a bit of a roundabout
procedure that is not directly supported by the kernel.  In <a
href="https://github.com/brauner/mount-idmapped/blob/master/mount-idmapped.c">a sample
<tt>mount-idmapped</tt> tool</a> written by Brauner, this task is done by
creating a new process within its own user namespace.  The child process
does nothing but suspend itself with a <tt>SIGSTOP</tt> signal while the
parent creates a reference to the child's user namespace by opening the associated
<tt>/proc</tt> file.
<p>
The next step is to establish the ID mapping in the newly created user
namespace; this is done by writing appropriate values to the
<tt>uid_map</tt> and <tt>gid_map</tt> files in the child process's
<tt>/proc</tt> directory.  Once that has been done, the child can just be
killed off; the open file descriptor to its user namespace will ensure that
it will stay around after the process is gone.

<p>
Actually associating the user namespace is done with the
<tt>mount_setattr()</tt> system call, which is also added by this patch
set:
<p>
<pre>
    struct mount_attr {
	__u64 attr_set;
	__u64 attr_clr;
	__u64 propagation;
	__u64 userns_fd;
    };

    int mount_setattr(int dfd, const char *path, unsigned int flags,
    		      struct mount_attr *attr, size_t attr_size);
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>attr_set</tt> and <tt>attr_clr</tt> fields of the
<tt>mount_attr</tt> structure describe the attributes to be set and
cleared, respectively; <tt>propagation</tt> controls whether this operation
affects only the filesystem indicated by <tt>dfd</tt> and <tt>path</tt> or
whether it also affects all filesystems currently mounted underneath it.  To add ID
mapping to a filesystem, the caller (who must have the
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability in the current patches) should set
<tt>MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP</tt> in 
<tt>attr_set</tt>, and set <tt>userns_fd</tt> to the file descriptor for
the relevant user namespace.
<p>
While ID mapping can apparently be set up for any filesystem mount, the
feature is expected to be mostly used with bind mounts, which create a new
view of an existing filesystem.  The above-linked cover letter for the
patch series gives a number of examples of how this capability could be
used.  A simple one involves just providing a view of a directory with the
files owned by a different user ID.  Another creates an identity mapping
(so IDs don't change), but that mapping lacks user ID&nbsp;0, preventing
access as root.  Filesystems without the concept of user IDs (such as VFAT)
can have those IDs grafted onto them with ID-mapped mounts.  And so on.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20201029003252.2128653-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">previous
posting</a> of this patch set generated a certain amount of 
interest.  This work seems to have the approval of the VFS developers,
which is a significant hurdle that any patch in this area must overcome.
So it might just be that a solution to the ID-mapping problem has finally
been found and there will be no need for yet another attempt â€” maybe.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Ideally the kernel would have a &quot;create_user_ns&quot; or &quot;new_user_ns&quot; system call which allocates a fresh user_ns and returns a file descriptor to its /proc directory, without any of these shenanigans required. Then openat could be used to get at the uid_map and gid_map files<br>

Another motivation was that whenever a filesystem is shared with an unprivileged container from the host or between unprivileged and privileged containers the user namespace of the container will usually be attached to the vfsmount. So for a lot of cases there&#x27;s no additional namespace. Just whenever there&#x27;s a complicated custom mapping required. Other use-cases where systemd maps a host mount to another set of ids it would just allocate a single namespace for the logged in user with the ids it allows to remap (Can be up to 340 individual mappings, ranges.) and can then mark whatever it wants.<br>

I am so excited about this.<br>
<p>
I am running a few applications on my home server which have access to the same set of personal files (`/data`):<br>
<p>
- sshfs: everything.<br>
- syncthing: mostly everything.<br>
- rslsync: photos of a family member who uses iOS (there is no syncthing on iOS).<br>
<p>
Now each application will have their own uid, with a &quot;real&quot; isolation from files they do not need. E.g. rslsync will have access only to photos of the family member, and restricted in all the other ways I can think of.<br>

You don&#x27;t need this feature in order for each application to have a different UID. This feature is for when you have a drive with files owned by root (or any UID), but you want the kernel to translate that so it looks like they&#x27;re owned by someone else (a different UID).<br>

E.g. mounting someone else&#x27;s ext4 USB stick so that you can access the files without sudo.<br>

In my previous job  I tried to build identical development environments via containers. One of the requirements I came up with was that it should run on almost all x86-64 Linux installations without having a sysadm around. With username spaces I succeeded with Bubblewrap which mounted a Fedora base image as rootfs and ran a lot of dnf install commands.<br>
<p>
 But I had to do hacks: every service user had to have uid 0 which was mapped to the developers uid in the image creation process. It had to be added to users and groups before installing packages. <br>
The way rootless docker and podman does it with remapping users requires an admin to set up uids belonging to the individual developer to be used for remapping root and service accounts. <br>
<p>
It would be very practical to simply be able to map all to one...<br>

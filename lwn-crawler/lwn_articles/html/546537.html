<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 9, 2013</br>
           </div>
The <tt>revoke()</tt> system call has one conceptually simple job: close
any open file descriptors for the pathname given as its argument and
prevent any further access via those descriptors.  The classic use case is
to ensure that no evil programs are holding a terminal or console device
open before allowing logins there, but others exist as well.  For example,
a functioning <tt>revoke()</tt> implementation could be used within the
kernel to cleanly disconnect any file descriptors referring to a device
that has been removed from the system; filesystems like <tt>/proc</tt>
could also use it to cleanly remove no-longer-needed virtual files.
<p>
There is only one problem: Linux does not support <tt>revoke()</tt>, and
every attempt to add it over the years has ended in failure.  The
functionality behind <tt>revoke()</tt> turns out to be quite difficult to
implement in a safe way.  The latest <a
href="/Articles/546540/">attempt</a> at a <tt>revoke()</tt> implementation
may well come to a similar conclusion; there is not even a proof-of-concept
patch to 
evaluate, after all.  But, since the developer behind it is Al Viro, one
assumes that its chances of success are mildly better than average.
<p>
Not every file or device will support <tt>revoke()</tt>; in some cases, it
may still prove too hard to do properly.  With Al's proposal, in cases
where revocation <i>is</i> supported, there would be a new structure
associated with the relevant device (or other) structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct revokable {
	atomic_t in_use;		// number of threads in methods,
	spinlock_t lock;
	hlist_head list;
	struct completion *c;
	void (*kick)(struct revokable *);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>in_use</tt> field is charged with tracking how many threads are
actively executing in the <tt>file_operations</tt> methods associated with
this object.  Performing this tracking would require changing every method
call site throughout the kernel to call a couple of helper functions and
check for a revoked file.  So a call that currently looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    ret = file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read(...);
</pre>
<p>
Would be turned into something like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (start_using(file)) {
	ret = file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read(...);
	stop_using(file);
    } else {
	ret = -EIO;  /* File revoked */
    }
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>start_using()</tt> and <tt>stop_using()</tt> helper functions
increment and 
decrement the <tt>in_use</tt> counter.  If that counter is negative,
though, access is being revoked and <tt>start_using()</tt> will return
<tt>false</tt>; in such cases, the <tt>file_operations</tt> method should
not be called and an appropriate error code should be returned.  Naturally,
the details of these helper functions are a bit more complex than this; see
Al's posting for a more complete story.  As Al notes, there are quite a few
call sites for <tt>file_operations</tt> methods in the kernel, so this
particular change would be relatively intrusive.
<p>
The purpose of the <tt>kick()</tt> callback is to instruct the object's driver
that access is being revoked and any outstanding I/O operations
should be brought to an end.  Processes waiting on I/O should return with
an error code and the I/O canceled.  After the <tt>kick()</tt> call, the
number of threads 
running within the object's <tt>file_operations</tt> should quickly drop to
zero.
<p>
When <tt>open()</tt> is called on an object that supports revocation, the
associated <tt>file</tt> structure will gain a pointer to a structure like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct revoke {
	struct file *file;
	struct revokable *revokable;
	struct hlist_node list;
	bool closing;
	struct completion *c;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>list</tt> field is used to track all open files associated with a
given revocable object.  As the last step in an <tt>open()</tt>
implementation, the <tt>make_revokable()</tt> helper will be called to
allocate the <tt>revoke</tt> structure and attach it to the list in the
object's <tt>revokable</tt> structure.
<p>
With this infrastructure in place, an implementation of <tt>revoke()</tt>
becomes possible.  The steps, roughly, are these:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Mark the object as being revoked by subtracting a large number from 
     its <tt>in_use</tt> counter, turning that counter negative.  That will
     prevent any further calls to the object's <tt>file_operations</tt>
     methods. 
<p>
<li> If <tt>in_use</tt> indicates that threads are currently running in the
     object's <tt>file_operations</tt>, call <tt>kick()</tt> to encourage
     them all to finish and wait until they all complete.
<p>
<li> For each open file, call the <tt>release()</tt> method to close that
     file, and remove the file from the list.
</ol>
At the end of this process, there should be no open files for the given
object and no threads will be running in any file operations associated
with that object.  The latter point is important; a robust and secure
<tt>revoke()</tt> implementation is possible only if the kernel can be sure
that all previous references to the revoked object are truly gone.  Once
that has happened, it should then be possible to free any associated
resources or allow new processes to open the object.
<p>
There is, of course, one other thorny little problem: what do to about
processes that have used <tt>mmap()</tt> to map the object into their
address space.  One possibility is to forcibly unmap the memory, tearing
down the associated page tables and marking the virtual memory area (VMA)
structure accordingly; the process would then most likely receive a
<tt>SIGSEGV</tt> signal if it attempted to access that address space.  That
approach is secure, but also risks causing programs to crash unexpectedly.
In
cases where device memory has been mapped, a better solution might be to
just cause all accesses to return <tt>0xff</tt> (extended out to the
correct width for the specific access).  Proper handling of <tt>mmap()</tt>
in this situation is an open question, and one apparently without precedent
in the current implementations of <tt>revoke()</tt> in other systems —
<tt>revoke()</tt> on BSD systems works only on devices without mapped memory.
<p>
There is a fair gap between an RFC posting with a clever idea and an
actual, working implementation; it may well be that this approach to
<tt>revoke()</tt> will, like its predecessors, run aground in the real
world.  But the lack of a working <tt>revoke()</tt> has been seen as a
shortcoming in Linux for many years; it would be nice to finally get this
functionality into place.  So, just maybe, things will work out this time
around.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
SIGSEGV is the only reasonable option here. Corrupting the data the process reads is much more likely to make a program crash in a bad way.  Think banking, finance, or industrial control.   Instead of a stopped process, you could have corrupted transactions.<br>

I would think SIGBUS would make more sense than SIGSEGV. IIRC that is the signal you get when the underlying device reports an I/O error. Simply unmapping the memory could still lead to the wrong data being read (or written!) if a later mmap call reuses the now-free address space.<br>

How about, if a process has a mapping on a revoke()d fd, it gets a SIGBUS as a notification *at the time revoke() happens*. If it tries to access the mapping, it gets a SIGSEGV.<br>
<p>
Processes could then try to catch SIGBUS and internally mark any mmap()ed regions as invalid if they want. Or mremap() them? Which could return EINVAL rather than EFAULT for revoked mappings?<br>
<p>
There will presumably still be race conditions where one thread might access the mapped region before the signal handler completes, but presumably that's still better than the alternative - no notice, guaranteed segv.<br>

<p>

I'm running Fedora -- if I remove the setuid bit, X won't start because it lacks permission to hijack a tty. (Maybe I can fix this, but I don't know how. There are so many special groups on modern desktops..)<br>

I'm assuming you're using startx for this? If that's the case, I had filed a bug about programs in the X session being denied PolicyKit since the TTY didn't match the login TTY. You can pass "vt02" to launch on a separate TTY, but I think you still need suid to do that.<br>
<p>
On a related note, that's the reason why a systemd --user session doesn't work right now: I get denied taking over the TTY, but I can't use a different TTY because PolicyKit denies nice things like suspend and shutdown.<br>

You are also conflating the setuid bit on Xorg with running as root - these are two independent things.<br>

I was referring to apoelstra's or nix's systems but anyway, nice to know. :)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; You are also conflating the setuid bit on Xorg with running as root - these are two independent things.</font><br>
<p>
Not really. You mentioned that Xorg is running as root because it's setuid root, and that this was a "huge attack surface", without specifying which part. So while I agree making the full-blown Xorg setuid root is an attack vector, to me it's just tiny (because it's easy to avoid with the Debian wrapper for example) in comparison to running the X server as root, which I assume is still the case with something like GDM. The whole point of this subthread was the possibility of being able to finally run the X server as non-root, which would get rid of the actual (IMO) huge attack surface.<br>

I'm curious about revoke. For forced drm module unloading of drivers (nouveau/ati) I've done something similar, but the real problem is racing with mmaps, during mmap and munmap there is a point where the mapping is removed off (or not yet added) to the list, but is still valid, just not yet tracked.<br>
<p>
I haven't figured out how to close the mmap race there, but for the revoke case it might be important.<br>

      <P>What about just converting the mapping to a private, anonymous, no-permission mapping?  That is, leave a mapping there (so future mmap() won't use the address space), but mark it no-access (PROT_NONE).  Furthermore, block mprotect() from adding access back to the memory—ie. always return EACCESS.</P>
<P>That'll prevent the mremap/mmap address reuse mentioned downthread, by reserving the address range, and it will still allow an munmap to unmap the memory without incident if the process finds out the resource went away through some other mechanism.</P>
<P>It'll give SIGSEGV, not SIGBUS as some argued might be better, but I'm not really sure I see why SIGBUS is better.  SIGBUS means you tried to access physical memory that wasn't there, or in a way that it doesn't support (ie. misaligned access on architectures that don't support it).  SIGSEGV means that you're trying access a virtual mapping you do not have rights to.  In this case, it's because your rights have been revoke()'d.</P>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; SIGBUS means you tried to access physical memory that wasn't there ...</font><br>
<p>
Isn't that exactly what happens when you try to access memory which has been revoke()'d? You mapped a range of a file/device into memory, but when you tried to access it the backing device wasn't available.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; SIGSEGV means that you're trying access a virtual mapping you do not have rights to. In this case, it's because your rights have been revoke()'d.</font><br>
<p>
Generally these rights are the ones the program set up via mmap() and mprotect(). They don't change asynchronously. SIGBUS, on the other hand, can already occur due to asynchronous events, like an I/O error reading from an mmap()'d file. (Which could be due to e.g. unplugging a USB drive, one of the use cases for revoke(). Choosing SIGBUS would mean unmodified programs continue to see the same behavior in such cases.)<br>

      <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, please, no! Solutions which return some value or which allow reuse of the process' virtual address space without notification are going to cause the process to use bad data without any way to know this has happened. Huge possibilities for *bad* things to happen.</p>
<p>Signals may be the best way to handle this because they, at least, guarantee that naive programs, i.e. those that are not programmed to handle revocation of a file descriptor, will quickly draw attention to themselves as requiring a fix.</p>
<p>One other possibility would be to disallow revoke() if the device is mapped unless the process has indicated it can handle it via some other system call (revoke_ok(), perhaps). Then it can chose to handle it with a signal, by getting some magic value from memory, or something else entirely. This may the the most backward compatible approach.</p>

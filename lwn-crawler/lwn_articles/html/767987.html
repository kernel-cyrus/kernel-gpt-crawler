           </div>
Block I/O performance can be one of the determining factors for the
performance of a system as a whole, especially on systems with slower
drives.  The need to optimize I/O patterns has led to the development of a
long series of I/O schedulers over the years; one of the most recent of
those is <a href="/Articles/674308/">BFQ</a>, which was merged during the
4.12 development cycle.  BFQ incorporates an impressive set of heuristics
designed to improve interactive performance, but it has, thus far, seen
relatively little uptake in deployed systems.  An attempt to make BFQ the
default I/O scheduler for some types of storage devices has raised some
interesting questions, though, on how such decisions should be made.
<p>
A bit of review for those who haven't been following the block layer
closely may be in order.  There are two generations of the internal API
used between the block layer and the underlying device drivers, which we
can call "legacy" and "multiqueue".  Unsurprisingly, the legacy API is
older, while <a href="/Articles/552904/">the multiqueue API</a> was first
merged in 3.13.  The conversion 
of block drivers to the multiqueue API has been ongoing since then, with
the SCSI subsystem only <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d5038a13eca72fb216c07eb717169092e92284f1">switching
over</a>, after a false start, in the upcoming 4.19 release.  Most of the
remaining holdout legacy drivers <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20181011165909.32615-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">will be
converted</a> to multiqueue in the near future, at which point the legacy
API can be expected to go away.

<p>
Several I/O schedulers exist for the legacy interface but, in practice,
only two are in common use: <tt>cfq</tt> for slower drives and
<tt>none</tt> for fast, solid-state devices.  The multiqueue interface was
aimed at fast devices from the outset; it was not able to support an I/O
scheduler at all initially.  That capability was added later, along with
the <tt>mq-deadline</tt> scheduler, which was essentially a forward port of
one of 
the simpler legacy schedulers (<tt>deadline</tt>).  BFQ, which came later,
is also a multiqueue-API scheduler.
<p>
In early October Linus Walleij <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20181002124329.21248-1-linus.walleij@linaro.org/">posted
a patch</a> making BFQ the default I/O scheduler for single-queue devices
driven by way of the multiqueue API.
The idea of a single-queue multiqueue device may seem a bit contradictory
at a first encounter, but one should remember that "multiqueue" refers 
to the API which, unlike the legacy API, is capable of handling block
devices that implement more 
than one queue in hardware (but does not require multiple queues).  As more
drivers move to this API, more 
single-queue devices will be driven using it.  In this particular case,
Walleij is concerned with SD cards and similar devices, the kind often
found in mobile systems.  The expectation is that devices with a single
hardware queue can be expected to be relatively slow, and that  BFQ will
extract better performance from those devices.
<p>
The initial <a
href="/ml/linux-block/05fdbe23-ec01-895f-e67e-abff85c1ece2@kernel.dk/">response</a>
from block subsystem maintainer Jens Axboe was not entirely positive:
"<q>I think this should just be done with udev rules, and I'd prefer if
the distros would lead the way on this</q>".  This approach is not
inconsistent with how the kernel tries to do things in general, leaving
policy decisions to user space.  But, of course, current kernels, by
selecting <tt>mq-deadline</tt> for such devices, are already implementing a
specific policy.
<p>
There were a few objections made to Axboe's position.  Paolo Valente, the
creator of BFQ, <a
href="/ml/linux-block/B5321A64-8A1A-42FF-A337-F4524BDA179B@linaro.org/">asserted</a>
that almost nobody understands I/O schedulers or how to choose one, so
almost everybody will stick with whatever default the system gives them.
And <tt>mq-deadline</tt>, as a default, is far worse than BFQ for such
devices, he said.  Walleij <a
href="/ml/linux-block/CACRpkdZFeGy2e9OiDYaq_8XwMTjCd+oeGiJ1HXzNifqZyxPkKw@mail.gmail.com/">added</a>
that there are quite a few systems out there that do not use <tt>udev</tt>
at all, so a rule-based approach will not work for them.  On embedded
systems where <tt>initramfs</tt> is not in use, it's currently not possible
to mount the root filesystem using BFQ at all.  As an additional
practical difficulty, the number of hardware queues provided by a device is
currently not made available to <tt>udev</tt>, so it could not effect this
particular policy choice in any case (though that would be relatively
straightforward to fix).
<p>
Oleksandr Natalenko <a
href="/ml/linux-block/1eca41df95ff660eb247a3de666adeb4@natalenko.name/">was
not impressed</a> by the embedded-systems argument; he said that the people
building such systems know which I/O scheduler they should use and can build
their systems accordingly.  Mark Brown <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20181003145150.GC7132@sirena.org.uk/">took issue</a>
with that view of things, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	That's not an entirely realistic assessment of a lot of practical
	embedded development - while people *can* go in and tweak things to
	their heart's content and some will have the time to do that
	there's a lot of small teams pulling together entire systems who
	rely fairly heavily on defaults, focusing most of their effort on
	the bits of code they directly wrote.
</div>
<p>
Walleij <a
href="/ml/linux-block/CACRpkdb1YSw3WWpGSqwxORaMSAeemiaP4i6cWJcY5VtADfzorQ@mail.gmail.com/">echoed</a>
that view, and added that there have been many times in kernel history
where the decision was made to try to do the right thing automatically
when possible, without requiring intervention from user space.
<p>
Bart Van Assche, instead, questioned the superiority of the BFQ scheduler.
He initially <a
href="/ml/linux-block/1538683746.230807.9.camel@acm.org/">claimed</a> that
it would slow down kernel builds (a sure way to prevent your code from
being merged), but Valente <a
href="/ml/linux-block/A017CAC7-41E6-4BB3-AC31-5EB524276138@linaro.org/">challenged</a>
that assessment.  Van Assche's other <a
href="/ml/linux-block/20bfa679-3131-e0af-f69d-2fbec32fbced@acm.org/">concern</a>,
though, had to do with fast solid-state SATA drives.  Once SCSI switches
over to the multiqueue API, those drives will show up with a single queue,
and will thus be affected by this change.  He questioned whether BFQ could
be as fast as <tt>mq-deadline</tt> in that situation, but did not present
any test results.
<p>
One other potential problem, as <a
href="/ml/linux-block/BN3PR0401MB164003C967C45F2681F503A7E7E90@BN3PR0401MB1640.namprd04.prod.outlook.com/">pointed
out</a> by Damien Le Moal, is shingled magnetic recording (SMR) disks,
which often require that write operations arrive in a specific order.  BFQ
does not provide the same ordering guarantees that <tt>mq-deadline</tt>
does, so attempts to use it with SMR drives are unlikely to lead to a high
level of user satisfaction.  Valente <a
href="/ml/linux-block/44614924-FF19-4C99-B04F-93C032B74395@linaro.org/">has
a plan</a> for how to support those drives in BFQ, but he acknowledged that
they will not work correctly now.
<p>
The discussion wound down without reaching any sort of clear conclusion.
It would appear that, before being merged, a patch of this nature would
need to gain some additional checks to ensure, at a minimum, that BFQ is
not selected for hardware that it cannot schedule properly.  No such
revision has been posted as of this writing.  The proponents of BFQ seem
unlikely to give up in the near future, though, so this topic seems like
one that can be expected to arise again.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just for the record, that Oleksandr Natalenko guy (aka me) is using BFQ since the very early days of its existing (2009, I believe? BFQ was definitely merged into pf-kernel for v2.6.31, at least) and has nothing against its proven superiority. It is just the automated choice for everyone that is questionable.<br>

For a device that does have multiple queues, does the kernel use "none" or "mq-deadline" by default? I have a recent NVMe drive, and the kernel seems to default to "none"; I'm wondering if that's the right default.<br>

Seems that there is only one list for IO schedulers, both normal and multi-queue schedulers are put on the same list. You can only choose default for the normal schedulers, not for the MQ ones. So apparently the default for mq-scheduler is thus nop as there is no way to set it up at compile time.<br>

OK, but do we know at least how the small, "early adopters" minority configure their systems and why?<br>
<p>
Changing a default setting without *any* prior, "from the field" experience would be wrong. Sorry if I missed something.<br>

I am sorry that I (Linus Walleij) have not posted a v2 yet, but it's on my laptop and it enforces mq-deadline on SMR devices while still letting single queue devices use BFQ by default. I will post it next week or so, just waiting for the debate to conclude. I am anyways going to maintain that patch for myself, so who knows, I might go and lobby it into a few distributions where it makes sense, if that is what it takes. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.<br>

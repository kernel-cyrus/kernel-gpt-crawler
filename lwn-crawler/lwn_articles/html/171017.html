A set of patches for the management of virtual process IDs within
containers was discussed here <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/168093/">a
few weeks ago</a>.  That patch set drew some interest, but a fair amount of
concern as well.  It is a large set of changes reaching all over the
kernel; it seemed to many that there should be a better way.
Since then, two candidates for the "better way" have been posted, and the
situation seems less clear than ever.  This sort of virtualization is
clearly of interest to a number of projects, but there is little consensus
on how it should be done.
<p>

One of the new entrants is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/170569/">OpenVZ PID virtualization code</a>,
posted by Kirill Korotaev but originally developed by Alexey Kuznetsov.
These patches introduce a container called a VPS (virtual private server),
each of which can virtualize a number of aspects of the host system,
including process IDs.  Each process has a real and virtual PID; all PIDs
of the virtual variety are identified by having a specific bit set.  In the
simple case, the virtual-PID bit is the only difference between the real
and virtual IDs, but more complex mappings are possible as well.
<p>

There is the usual set of functions to convert between real and virtual
PIDs (and group, process group, and thread IDs as well).  All code which
deals with user space must work with virtual PIDs, but internal code uses
real PIDs, so a certain amount of awareness is called for.  Since there is
a specific bit used to mark virtual PIDs, the code is at least able to
catch situations where the wrong type of PID is used.  There is also a
change to the internal <tt>fork()</tt> implementation allowing a process to
be created with a specific virtual PID; this feature can be used to launch
a new container with its top-level process having PID&nbsp;1.
<p>

The other implementation is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/170802/">this
"process ID namespace" patch set</a> from Eric Biederman.  It does away
with the concept of virtual PIDs in favor of a different view of the
problem.  For starters, every process gets a "wait ID" - the process ID
by which its parents know it.  In most cases, the "wait ID" will be the
same as the PID, but, in cases where a process is the leader of a
virtualized group, the two will be different.
<p>

Then Eric adds process ID spaces.  A process ID space (pspace) is simply a
range of independent PIDs, associated with tree of processes.  By
default, the entire system shares one process space, but, by way of a
<tt>clone()</tt> flag, a new process can be created in its own space.
Process IDs are unique within any one pspace, but may be duplicated in
other spaces.  So the kernel, when it must identify a process unambiguously
using a PID, must now use a (pspace,&nbsp;PID) tuple.  Functions which deal
in PIDs - <tt>kill_pg()</tt> or <tt>find_task_by_pid()</tt>, for example -
get a new pspace parameter.

<p>

This approach has the advantage that there is no distinction between real
and virtual PIDs - <i>all</i> PIDs are interpreted relative to a PID
space.  There is no real possibility of confusing real and virtual PIDs, or
interpreting PIDs relative to the wrong pspace.  So it should be a
relatively safe addition to the kernel.  On the other hand, Eric's patches
don't even try to address the larger virtualization problem; anybody
wanting to implement complete containers will still have to do that work
separately.  Of course, as has been seen, a few projects have already done
that work; it's just a matter of seeing which implementation, if any, gets
into the mainline.
<p>

On that question, it is far too early to say what might happen.  Linus has
<a href="/Articles/171025/">indicated</a> that he likes the container
concept from the OpenVZ patches, but that does not necessarily extend to
the PID virtualization part of it.  Eric has tried to focus the discussion
with <a href="/Articles/171026/">a summary of the relevant issues</a> and
questions which must be resolved going forward.  But there is a certain
amount of disagreement, and a few projects which have each invested
significant time into their particular approaches.  It may be a while
before the dust settles on this one.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      He he he. Looks like the kernel's going to get <a href="http://www.it.physto.se/index.php?invoke=46-AFS//10-user_guide.html&invoketext=user%C2%A0guide#SECTION00720000000000000000">AFS -like PAGs</a> after all.

      My approach does address the architecture for the larger issue.<br>
<p>
I just assume that we won't solve all of the problems simultaneously.  The problem is just to big.  So by taking the problem one namespace at a time we can incrementally get code into the kernel.  As well as allowing flexibility as well.<br>
<p>
I am reusing the architecture we already have that has used tasks to build threads, and processes.  I am just taking the next step to build virtual<br>
private servers/guest/containers/...  Whatever you want to call them.<br>

      Eric, you know well that your approach has disadvantages:<br>
- you introduce strong isolation, when host can't access container. <br>
This makes containers less manageable. For example, in OpenVZ host system can control processes from VPS. You can gdb/strace/kill etc. You can use ps/top and all the existing tools. In your case, you need to introduce new syscalls, which would allow to ptrace/kill foreign processes and you need to patch all the management tools in the world.<br>
- On the other hand VPID approach can be easialy used for both weak/strong isolation. It doesn't care.<br>
- you mess up with interfaces like clone().<br>
- I wouldn't mention your approach to procfs, while OpenVZ virtualizes this FS.<br>
- you missed a lot of issues/bugs/SMP races which were pointed to you<br>
<p>
Just my 2 cents if you start making PR.<br>

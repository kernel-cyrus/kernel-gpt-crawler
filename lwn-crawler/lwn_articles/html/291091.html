           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 22, 2008</br>
           </div>
Three weeks ago, LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287906/">looked at
the renewed interest in dynamic tracing</a>, with an emphasis on
SystemTap.  Tracing is a perennial presence on end-user wishlists; it
remains a handy tool for companies like Sun Microsystems, which wish to
show that their offerings (Solaris, for example) are superior to Linux.  It
is not surprising that there 
is a lot of interest in tracing implementations for Linux; the main
surprise is that, after all this time, Linux still does not have a
top-quality answer to DTrace - though, arguably, <a
href="/Articles/291092/">Linux had a working tracing mechanism</a> long
before DTrace made its appearance.
<p>
Even a casual reader of the kernel mailing list will have noticed that
there are a lot of tracing-related patches in circulation at the moment.
There are so many, in fact, that it is hard to keep track of them all.  So
this article will take a quick look at the code which has been posted in an
attempt to make the various options a bit clearer.
<p>
<h3>SystemTap</h3>
<p>
SystemTap remains the presumptive Linux tracing solution of choice.
It is hampered by a few problems, though, including usability issues, a
complete lack of static trace points in the mainline kernel, and no
user-space tracing capability.  On the
usability side, we are seeing a few more kernel developers trying to put
SystemTap to work and posting about the problems they are having.  If one
takes as a working hypothesis the notion that, if kernel hackers cannot
make SystemTap work, many other users are likely to encounter difficulties
as well, then one might conclude that addressing the reported problems
would be a priority for the SystemTap developers.
<p>
The SystemTap developers do seem to be interested in these reports, which
is a good sign.  There are other things happening in the SystemTap arena,
including the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290127/">release of
version&nbsp;0.7</a> on July&nbsp;15.  This release adds a number of new
features and tapsets, and a substantial set of examples as well.
Meanwhile, Anup Shan has posted <a href="/Articles/289932/">an interesting
integration of SystemTap and the fault injection framework</a>, allowing
tapsets to control fault injection and trace the results.
<p>
James Bottomley has been playing some with the SystemTap code; one result
of that work is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290159/">changes to
SystemTap's internal relocation code</a> in an attempt to make it more
acceptable for mainline kernel inclusion.  There can be no doubt that the
out-of-tree nature of much of the SystemTap support code has made it harder
for that code to progress, so any improvement which makes it more likely
that some of this code will be merged is welcome.
<p>
Also by James is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/289339/">this patch</a>
implementing a new way to put markers into the kernel.  The addition of
markers (or static tracepoints) has always been problematic in that many of
these markers, by their nature, need to go into some of the hottest code
paths in the kernel.  To support dynamic tracing, these markers need to be
available on production systems, so they must work without creating any
significant performance regressions.  Quite a bit of work has gone into the
static marker code which is in the kernel (but mostly unused) now, but some
developers are still uncomfortable with putting them into
performance-critical paths.
<p>
James's patch addresses these concerns by putting the tracepoints entirely
outside of the code paths.  Rather than add some sort of marker to the
code, these markers just make a note of just where in the code the marker
is supposed to be; this note is stored in a separate part of the kernel
binary.  That information is enough for a run-time tool to patch in an
actual jump to a tracing function should somebody want to see the
information from that tracepoint.  An additional benefit is that these
markers do not interfere with any optimizations done by the compiler.  Other
solutions can insert optimization barriers which, while they do make life
easier for the tracing subsystem, also affect the speed of the code even
when the trace points are not active.
<p>

<h3>Ftrace</h3>
<p>
The text above said that the kernel's static tracepoint
code is "mostly unused."  That would have been better expressed as
"completely," except that the 2.6.27 kernel will include a user in the form
of the ftrace framework.  One of the things which makes ftrace truly unique
is that its documentation was not only merged before the code itself, but
well before: the 2.6.26 kernel includes the excellent <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290277/">Documentation/ftrace.txt</a> file.
<p>
The ftrace (which stands for "function tracer") framework is one of the
many improvements to come out of the realtime effort.  Unlike SystemTap, it
does not attempt to be a comprehensive, scriptable facility; ftrace is much
more oriented toward simplicity.  There is a set of virtual files in a
debugfs directory which can be used to enable specific tracers and see the
results.  The function tracer after which ftrace is named simply outputs
each function called in the kernel as it happens.  Other tracers look at
wakeup latency, events enabling and disabling interrupts and preemption,
task switches, etc.  As one might expect, the available information is
best suited for developers working on improving realtime response in
Linux.  The ftrace framework makes it easy to add new tracers, though, so
chances are good that other types of events will be added as developers
think of things they would like to look at.
<p>
<h3>Tracepoints</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/245671/">kernel
markers</a> mechanism is meant to be the way that static tracepoints are
inserted into the kernel.  To that end, a great deal of effort went into
making these markers fast; they are, for all practical purposes, a set of
no-op instructions until somebody wants to turn one on, at which point the
real tracing code is patched into the running kernel.  Since they were
merged, however, kernel markers have been the subject of a few grumbles.
<p>
In particular, kernel markers use a somewhat awkward mechanism to ensure
that any arguments passed to the tracing function are interpreted correctly
there.  Each marker has a <tt>printk()</tt>-style format string associated
with it; that string describes the type of each "argument" (a variable
or expression within the code being traced).  When tracing code activates a
marker, it will supply a function to be called when the marker is hit and a
format string describing the arguments that the function expects.  The
marker code will ensure that both format strings match; otherwise the
marker will not be enabled.  The problem is that the format string requires
extra work to write and is only approximate in its specification of the
types involved.  These strings can make it clear that a given argument is a
pointer, for example, but they say nothing about what type is pointed to.
<p>

In response to various efforts to get around this issue, Mathieu Desnoyers
(the original author of the kernel marker work) has proposed a new
mechanism called <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290203/">tracepoints</a>.  They are another
way of putting static trace points into the kernel, but with a simpler and
more type-safe way of putting the pieces together.
<p>

With tracepoints, every trace point must be declared in a header file with
a mildly ugly set of macros:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/tracepoint.h&gt;

    DEFINE_TRACE(tracepoint_name,
                 TPPROTO(trace_function_prototype),
		 TPARGS(trace_function_args));
</pre>
<p>

This definition will create a new tracepoint called
<tt>tracepoint_name</tt>.  Any function attached to that tracepoint must
have a function prototype as provided in the <tt>TPPROTO()</tt> macro; the
names of the associated arguments are provided with <tt>TPARGS()</tt>.
<p>
Perhaps this is better understood with an example.  The tracepoints patch
set includes quite a few static points for use with the LTTng tracing
toolkit.  There is one called <tt>sched_wakeup</tt> which fires whenever
the scheduler wakes up a process.  It is defined with:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_TRACE(sched_wakeup,
	         TPPROTO(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p),
		 TPARGS(rq, p));
</pre>
<p>
The actual insertion of the tracepoint is a line like this:
<p>
<pre>
    trace_sched_wakeup(rq, p);
</pre>
<p>
Note the <tt>trace_</tt> prefix added to the supplied name.  At this point
in the code, a tracing function can be called with <tt>rq</tt> (the run
queue of interest) and <tt>p</tt> (the process which is waking up) as parameters.
Until an actual function is connected to the tracepoint, though, this
declaration is essentially a no-op.  Connection of a trace function is done
through a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void my_sched_wakeup_tracer(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);

    register_trace_sched_wakeup(my_sched_wakeup_tracer);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>register_trace_sched_wakeup()</tt> function (created as part of the
<tt>DEFINE_TRACE()</tt> definition) will connect the supplied trace
function to the tracepoint.  The fact that the function prototype for the
trace function is supplied as part of the tracepoint definition means that
the compiler can perform thorough type checking; if the prototypes do not
match up, compilation will fail.  And that, in turn, should put an end to
those embarrassing situations where turning on tracing causes the system to
go down in flames.
<p>
Interestingly, tracepoints have dispensed with much of the mechanism
developed to minimize the runtime impact of kernel markers; in particular,
they do not use the "immediate values" code.  Profiling has shown that the
performance impact of tracepoints is so low that there is little value in
the added complexity of runtime patching of kernel code.  Still, there are
signs that some kernel developers will object to the addition of
tracepoints in their current form.  Developers want tracing support - but
not at the cost of slower performance, even if that cost is hard to
measure.
<p>
<h3>Tracehook</h3>
<p>
Finally, Roland McGrath recently surfaced with the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290954/">tracehook</a> patch set.  Tracehook
has a rather different focus; it is, essentially, a cleanup of the way the
kernel handles the <tt>ptrace()</tt> system call.  The tracehook patches
try to organize all of the process tracing code (much of which is
architecture-dependent) into one place where it can be dealt with as a
unit. 
<p>
Tracehook is meant to be a first step toward the merging of a new version
of the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224772/">utrace</a> code.  Utrace
has long been planned as the successor to the current <tt>ptrace()</tt>
implementation, which has few admirers.  But utrace has encountered a
number of difficulties, so its path into the kernel has been slow.  It
disappeared from the lists entirely for a while, but a new version of the
patches is said to be coming soon; Roland notes that he expects "some
vigorous feedback" when that happens.
<p>

The real importance of the <tt>ptrace()</tt> rework is that it is the path
toward integrated tracing of kernel- and user-space events.  And that, of
course, is one of the biggest features offered by DTrace which is not yet
available in SystemTap.  Getting user-space tracing into the kernel -
especially if it could work with the tracepoints already being inserted
into some applications for DTrace - would be a major step forward for
Linux.  A lot of people will be watching when this patch set comes around
again.
<p>
Meanwhile, Roland would like to see the tracehook code merged for 2.6.27.
He is late to the party, though, and this code has not done any time in
linux-next.  So it is not yet clear whether tracehook will go in before the
merge window closes, or whether, instead, it will have to wait for 2.6.28. 

<p>
<h3>In summary...</h3>
<p>
As can be seen, there is a lot happening in the area of tracing support for
Linux.  Tracing, it seems, is an idea whose time has come, at last.  If the
pieces described here can be merged and integrated into a unified
framework, and if it can all be made sufficiently easy to use, the time for
"DTrace envy" will come to an end.  Those "ifs" are not small ones,
though.  There is quite a bit of work to be done yet; hopefully the current
level of energy will remain until the job is done.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

DTrace on Linux is basicly a noop due to licensing conflict. Now what would happen if someone
wrote a syntax compatible "dtrace interpreter" that used systemtap and utrace, once it comes
out?

That would be a win/win because you have 1 language, D, for tracing events on two of the most
popular posix platforms.

It might not be hard for systemtap to parse dtrace's smaller scripting
language, but there's more to it than that.  A variety of dtrace
kernel and userspace features have no equivalent yet, so many real
dtrace scripts would not work.  Plus, may dtrace scripts use
type names/structs/fields that do not correspond to those in
linux, so one would need to change those scripts or create a
solaris emulation layer someplace.

[[Plus, may dtrace scripts use type names/structs/fields that do not correspond to those in
linux, so one would need to change those scripts or create a solaris emulation layer
someplace.]]

Those issue are the same for FreeBSD, MacOS X, no?
And AFAIK they have not made a Solaris emulation layer, so Solaris-specific dtrace's script
won't work here either..

A compatibility layer with dtrace portable scripts would be nice, but compatibility with
OS-specific dtrace scripts doesn't matter much IMHO.

      <p>Forgive me for sounding ignorant, but why all the fuss about tracing the kernel?  And more specifically, why is there DTrace &quot;envy&quot; (referring to a previous week's LWN article)?</p>

<p>My impressions are that in the Linux kernel, the code is already well-optimized and (relatively) error-free, so why is there such a demand as of late to insert all these probes like stuffing pins in a pincushion?  Granted, I'm familiar with using tools like <font face="monospace">strace(1)</font> (and similar tools, both open-source and proprietary), but I'm still unsure why this has become such an important issue with regards to the kernel lately.</p>

<p>And, what's the envy all about over Sun Microsystems' DTrace?  Linux kernel devs are certainly capable of creating their own tracing tools (as this article explains).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any comments--I'm just trying to feed my curiosity by asking here.</p>

      This kind of tracing is wanted by people trying to track down problems which happen in production environments.  You need to see why the system is behaving poorly (or crashing) while operating under its real workload.  That requires the ability to hook into the system almost anywhere without perturbing its operation.  Tracing can be nice for normal kernel debugging, but it's the folks wondering why their monster trading systems are bogging down that really want it.
<p>
The "DTrace envy" is there (1) because Sun has been using it as one of its primary anti-Linux marketing tools, and (2) because what we have isn't as good.  We'll get there.

Another point is that unlike strace, SystemTap's system-wide[1], and being 
kernel side instead of going through the fragile (threads/signals...) &amp; 
slow ptrace() interface it can be much faster, especially after it starts 
using the static markers / tracepoints.

[1] One can attach strace to multiple processes, but it really slows down 
the system and is pretty inconvenient (ptrace has side-effects).  If one 
wants to do full system tracing, currently LTT is much better alternative 
than SystemTap though due to its much smaller overhead (especially with 
multiple probes).  LTT and SystemTap are a bit for different purposes 
though.

Currently neither LTT nor SystemTap provide user-space tracing like DTrace 
does, but I think Frysk does some of that.  Frysk doesn't do kernel 
tracing though and it would also profit from utrace as currently it uses 
ptrace().  (Note: ltrace tool is pretty useless for user-space tracing as 
it doesn't trace library-&gt;library calls and it doesn't support dlopen() 
which is used almost by anything a bit more complicated on Linux desktop).

Once one has system wide monitoring, one could have something like this:
- <a href="http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/filemon-like-systemwide-strace">http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/filemon-like-syste...</a>
- Or the RedHat Google SOC about getting BootChart type of visuals from 
SystemTap...

PS. This is not just DTrace envy, it would be nice to have a GUIs like 
these:
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/performance/optimizingwithsystemtrace.html">http://developer.apple.com/tools/performance/optimizingwi...</a>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/ViewingandAnalyzingData/chapter_6_section_2.html">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/C...</a>
(Instruments uses DTrace, Shark doesn't) :-)


Btw. This is more about performance analysis framework stuff than tracing, 
but what is happening with perfmon2?  Is that going to be used e.g. by 
LTT?

Regarding your ltrace comments, yes, it's a kludge. Thankfully glibc 
provides LD_AUDIT which is much more capable, because the dynamic linker 
really can tell what dynamic calls are being made. It would be even better 
if there was even the slightest hint of documentation about it, but 
thankfully we don't need that as Jiri Olsa has done it for us: 
&lt;<a href="http://latrace.sf.net/">http://latrace.sf.net/</a>&gt;.

Thanks, this looks useful!

(Although dynamic linker based things are faster than ptrace, they require 
restarting the monitored process to enabled the tracing so they are not 
very suitable for ad-hoc system monitoring.)

That's true. (Particularly true in this case, where quite a bit of the 
magic is handled at ld.so startup time.)

Currently, LTTng implements support for user-space markers on x86 32 and 64 bits. It's a bit
slow, since it goes through a system call each time an event record must be recorded, and the
API is subject to change, but one can currently add markers to their userspace program or
library. See the package : <a href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/markers-userspace-0.5.tar.bz2">http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/markers-userspace-0.5.tar.bz2</a>. It
depends on the LTTng patchset to enable/disable markers and to record data. The tarball
contains examples telling how to modify the makefiles and linker scripts to use markers in
userspace.

Being the LTTng project lead, I dream about a simple in-kernel API to manage the performance
counters, which would aim at managing these limited resources for the various users (watchdog,
user-space perfmon-like API, in-kernel LTTng). The tracer is itself easily extensible and can
record new events which include performance counters either in an interrupt mode or at
specific events occuring on the system (system call entry/exit, interrupt handler entry/exit,
trap entry/exit...). I just need something to setup these counters and let them run free on
the system without changing them when switching from one task to another : this is something
really annoying when gathering system-wide information. I haven't looked at the perfmon code
lately, but I think that most of the user-space system call API is useless to an in-kernel
user like LTTng. A minimalistic perfmon would be welcome.

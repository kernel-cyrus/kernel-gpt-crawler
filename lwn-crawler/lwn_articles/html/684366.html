In a combined storage and filesystem session at the 2016 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit (LSFMM), Chuck Lever talked about
using remote DMA (RDMA) for access to persistent memory.  But, more
generally, he was
"soliciting feedback and rotten tomatoes" about what changes might be
needed to make the various protocols and persistent storage classes/types
work well together. 
</p>

<a href="/Articles/684460/">

</a>

<p>
While he mostly discussed RDMA, Lever said that many of the same issues
apply to other protocols, such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI_Extensions_for_RDMA">iSER</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_RDMA_Protocol">SRP</a> at the
block layer and SMB 
Direct and NFS/RDMA at the file layer.  The performance equation for those
protocols and fast persistent devices is such
that the cost of making data durable may be less than that of the I/O
to get the data to the device.
</p>

<p>
So, Lever asked, why marry slow technology to this new fast
technology?  Data replication for disaster recovery is one particularly good
use case.  It can be set up so that there are geographically diverse
failure domains so that the data will be available for recovery.   There
are other use cases as well. 
</p>

<p>
Today, Linux uses a "pull mode" to do I/O to remote targets, where the initiator exposes
a region of its memory to the RDMA controller and sends a request to the
target, which then uses 
that memory to complete the request.  Once the initiator receives a reply,
it invalidates the memory it exposed so it can no longer be accessed.  For
a read, the target simply places the data into the initiator's memory using an RDMA
write.  But for a write request, the target must do an RDMA read to the
initiator to get
the data to be written and await the response before it can write it.  That means there is an
additional round-trip for writes.
</p>

<p>
There are some advantages to pull mode, Lever said, including good memory security,
since the initiator only exposes small amounts of memory and only for the
duration of the request.  In addition, the work to do the transfer is moved
to the target side, leaving the CPU on the initiator available for
application work.  There are several downsides too, however. There is more
than one interrupt for each request and the extra round-trip for write
requests.  In addition, the target CPU has to be involved in all requests.
</p>

<p>
The NFS server on Linux does not have zero-copy writeâ€”except for small I/O
operations, as Christoph Hellwig pointed out.  Lever said that RDMA could perhaps do
zero-copy writes to get better performance. He asked: should
<tt>splice()</tt> be used to do 
so?  Hellwig replied that "<tt>splice()</tt> is really nicely over-hyped"
and doesn't really help this kind of problem.  He suggested that any I/O for a fast
device should be using <a href="/Articles/348719/">direct I/O</a> to avoid
the page cache.
</p>

<p>
For the future, Lever wondered about switching to a "push mode" instead.
The initiator would register its interest in regions of a file and the
target would expose memory for the initiator to use for read and write operations on
those regions.  It would return handles to the regions for the initiator to use;
multiple RDMA read and write operations could be performed by the initiator
before it informed the target that it was done. At that point, the handles would be
invalidated (and the memory no longer exposed).
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o asked what the "security story" was for push mode.  Lever replied
that it uses "reliable connections" where there are only two peers.  That
connection is set up so that one side can view the other's memory based on
the handles.  Those handles are only valid for a single connection and the
hardware guarantees that other endpoints can't interfere with the connection.
</p>

<p>
One problem is that there is no generic way to ensure that writes have
reached durable storage for the remote storage protocols.  Each operating
system, network/fabric, and device has different durability guarantees and
its own way to ensure that a remote write is stored safely. Sagi Grimberg
suggested that code to ensure durability could be written once for all the 
different options and made available as a library, something like what <a
href="/Articles/610174/">DAX</a> has.   There was
general agreement that there should be an API made available that hides the
differences.

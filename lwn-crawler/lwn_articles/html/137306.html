<h1>The Integrity Measurement Architecture</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 24, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
One of the many new features in the 2.6.11 kernel was a driver for "trusted
platform module" (TPM) chips.  This driver made the low-level capabilities of TPM
chips available, but gave no indication of what sort of applications were
envisioned for those capabilities.  Reiner Sailer of IBM has now taken the
next step with <a href="/Articles/136834/">a set of patches</a>
implementing the "Integrity Measurement Architecture" (IMA) for Linux using
TPM. 
<p>
IMA is a remote attestation mechanism, designed to be able to convince a
remote party that a system is running (nothing but) a set of known and
approved executables.  It is set up as a security module, and works by
hooking into the <tt>mmap()</tt> operation.  Whenever a file is mapped in
an executable mode (which is what happens when a program is run or a
sharable library is mapped), the IMA hook will first perform and save an
SHA1 hash of the file.  On request, the IMA module can produce a list of
all programs run and their corresponding hash values.  This list can be
examined by a (possibly remote) program to ensure that no unknown or
known-vulnerable applications have been run.
<p>

If a hostile application has managed to take over the system, however, it
will be in a position to corrupt the list from the IMA module, rendering
that list useless.  This is where the TPM chip comes in.  The TPM contains
a set of "platform configuration registers" (PCRs) which are accessible to
the the rest of the system only in very specific ways.  The PCRs can be
reset to zero only when the system hardware itself is reset.  The host
system can pass data to the TPM which is to be included in a given PCR; the
TPM then computes a hash with the new information and stores the value in
the PCR.  A given set of values, if sent to a PCR in any order, will, at
the end, yield the same final hash value.  The TPM can provide that value
on request; it can also be made to sign the hash value using a top-secret
key hidden deeply within its tamper-proof packaging.
<p>

The IMA module works by sending each hash it computes to a PCR on the TPM
chip.  When it provides the list of executables and hash values, it can
also obtain and hand over a signed hash from the TPM.  A remote party can
then recompute the hash, compare it to what the TPM produced, and verify
that the provided list is accurate.  It is still possible for an intruder
to corrupt the list, but it will then fail to match the hash from the TPM.
It thus should be possible to remotely detect a compromised system.
<p>

Of course, if an attacker can gain control of the kernel at boot time,
before the IMA module has been initialized, the entire battle has been
lost.  The TPM designers have thought of this possibility, however; it is
possible to set up hardware so that it will not boot a system in the first
place unless the TPM approves of the code to be booted.
<p>

There are numerous possible applications of this sort of capability.  In a
highly secured network, systems could refuse to talk to each other until
each proves that it is running only approved software.  Financial web sites
could, if given access to this information, refuse access from systems
running browsers with known security problems.  The less flexible sort of
Linux support provider could refuse to work on systems which have run
programs which are not on The List Of Supported Applications.  Corporate IT
departments could get verifiable lists of which programs have run on each
system.  DRM-enabled software could refuse to unlock its valuable
intellectual property if the system looks suspicious.  And so on.
<p>

In the short term, however, this code looks like it will need some work
before it will be considered seriously for inclusion.  James Morris has <a
href="/Articles/137310/">questioned</a> the security module implementation,
arguing that this functionality should be implemented directly in the
kernel.  Loading the IMA module also makes it impossible to use any
other security module (such as SELinux), which may not enhance the overall
security of the system.  And Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/Articles/137311/">was unimpressed</a> with the quality of the code
in general:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Wow, for such a small file, every single function was incorrect.
	And you abused sysfs in a new and interesting way that I didn't
	think was even possible.  I think this is two new records you have
	set here, congratulations.
</div>
<p>
The IMA authors have now gone off to rework things.  At some point,
however, it seems likely that this sort of functionality will be available
in Linux.  Whether it will then be used to increase or restrict the freedom
of Linux users remains to be seen.

      Okay, so I can verify that my executable code is blessed. How does this protect me from exploits that use "blessed" interpreters, e.g. Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, Bash, etc.<br>
<p>
In the windows world, many viruses, trojans, and worms are written in embedded scripting languages. How does this protect me in the M$ scenarios?<br>
<p>
Does each interpreted program also need a hash signature?<br>
<p>
This seems to be a limited solution.<br>

      Pavel Machek &lt;pavel@ucw.cz&gt; made the same kind of objection on lkml saying "<a
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&m=111686978111563&w=2"
>What is it good for, then? So I have to put my backdoor into script,
not into an executable...</a>".<br>
Reiner Sailer &lt;sailer@us.ibm.com&gt; replied
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111682497821375&w=2"
>Scripts can be measured as well (from the user space). 
For example, equipping the bash shell with 5-10 lines of code, bash 
initiates IMA measurements on scripts and files that are sourced into bash before they are "executed" by bash. This way, startup scripts and executed scripts can be logged as measurements and the measuremnt list will include them.</a><br>
That led to more talk about lots of things and with Pavel
concluding <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111705854625378&w=2">Well, you'll have to add measurement of any security-sensitive config file, any script, and will have to make sure that all parsing of system config files does not contain buffer-overrun problems. That's lot of work before IMA is usefull. It is true you do not make situation any worse.</a><br>
What I wonder is if you can measure arbritary files from userspace what is to stop you from using altered scripts but also having the valid scripts put into the list?

      Do you mean "How do you prevent the exploit of registering A while runnning B?"? If so, read on...<br>
<p>
First off. TPM makes a few fundamental assumption about it's use: If [everything loaded before A] is valid, and A appears valid, then A is valid. If A is valid, than A can be truested.<br>
<p>
Basically, they check to make sure that every program that runs has not been modified from the version used to build the original hash. This includes the BIOS, the bootloader, the kernel, init, etc.<br>
<p>
So, given that assumption:<br>
<p>
If you add the TPM code to (say) bash, and bash is valid, then you know that any script run by bash will be verified by the TPM. Why? Because if the TPM code was changed, bash wouldn't be valid. (When the kernel loads bash, it would fail the check). As long as the script passed, you know it's safe to run.<br>
<p>
So, unless there was a security hole programmed into bash, you wouldn't need to worry about it running 1 script while verifying another.<br>

      Presumably you would just lie to the hardware that does the checksums.  It<br>
has no way to verify what you tell it is valid and will end up signing bad<br>
data.  Normally this wouldn't be possible because untrusted code isn't<br>
allowed to run, and even if it did, it would corrupt the secret state<br>
information.  All bets are off when the untrusted code is in charge from the<br>
start.  But maybe I misunderstand.<br>

      Since you start loading the PCRs when you use GRUB you can be assured that the boot block where grub resides is ok and that the kernel that GRUB loads is ok.<br>
<p>
But it all hangs on the weakest link during startup, if you manage to crack the bootup process to insert your own code then: Yes you can fool TCPA/TPM. But as long as you can load the kernel and there's no root exploit in it, you will have a verifiable environment.<br>
<p>
The TCPA chip of course rely alot on the human administrating the computer. You need to lock it down alot to make this work.<br>

      Like SeLinux (which I hope they can integrate with), this would require a complete rethinking of the OS and how it functions. I know that various 'secure' installations would love something like this to help make sure that the remote client is who they are and what they are. [It is not foolproof or a magic bullet in any shape or form.. but it is a possibly good step.] <br>
<p>
Personally I dont care for the uses that would limit support and such, but I do want to know that a laptop I sent into the field has a good chance of not being rooted before it VPN's in.<br>

      If I understand correctly, the system boils down to securely computing a hash of all programs run on a machine, signing it, and reporting it.  A remote party, such as a publisher or bank, refuses to communicate with you unless you're only running software that will look after the data (intellectual property, financial data, whatever).

<p>

The reporting step seems to be the weakest link.  If you want to steal intellectual property, simply run your machine once in the secure mode and record the signed hash as it is transmitted.  Reuse that value in the future as needed.  The same approach works if the attacker is a thief and the remote party is your bank: the thief records the correct signed hash on an uncompromised system and forces your (compromised) system to return it.

<p>

This may be more or less difficult if there are race conditions in IMA, there are available computers that can eavesdrop, the TPM's key is unique per computer, or your connection to the remote party is encrypted.  I can think of a few things that would probably solve the problem completely, but it's not clear if the authors have considered them.

<p>

Or am I confused and missing something important?

      Reiner Sailer &lt;sailer@us.ibm.com&gt; on the LKML has said
"<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111682497821375&w=2"
>You retrieve not only the measurement list from a system (kernel) but also
a signature over the TPM PCR holding the integrity value. Nonces
(random numbers) are used to protect against replay of old signed TPM PCR
contents by the kernel. Since PCR is signed inside the TPM together with
the nonce, corrupt system software can't cheat unnoticedly.</a>". So it seems they have thought of replay attacks.

      However they can't protect against an untrusted system feeding the hardware<br>
the checksums that would exist, in the correct order, on a trusted system.<br>
The untrusted system simply lies to itself.  Unless this hardware actually<br>
scanned through all of RAM I don't see how it could avoid this -- it relies<br>
on something external to perform the checksums.<br>
<p>
Thus the remote attestation feature can only be trusted when the system is<br>
not compromized before running the trusted IMA module, which is a severe<br>
limitation when you are talking about systems that people have physical<br>
access to.<br>

      It'll protect (to some extent) ordinary users from their own stupidity. Not much use if root themselves is trying to subvert it.<br>
<p>
1) Write your "black hat script"<br>
2) gdb /bin/sh<br>
3) break send_hash_to_kernel<br>
4) run sh black-hat-script.sh<br>
5) set hash_value = permitted_value<br>
6) continue<br>
<p>
The trusted computing folk can get around this by prohibiting gdb... anyone reminded of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html</a> ?<br>

      <i>The trusted computing folk can get around this by prohibiting gdb</i>

<p>Presumably, the trusted computing folks would not have gdb installed on a secure machine--gdb is inheirently insecurable from their perspective. The entire suite of dev tools is usually the first thing removed from a secure system.

<p>Also, you could use strip to remove the symbols from your binaries. That would make it nigh impossible to find anything with gdb.

<p>
Well, only statically linked stuff, or? Any symbol references to dynamically linked libraries remain clearly visible. Ok, ok, from a strict security point of view, dynamic linking has its own large set of issues.<br>

      So an attacker can easly review which version of the software I'm running check the vulnerability database and launch the proper attack without having to guess or try them all ...<br>
<p>
Great step forward for securing servers ...<br>
<p>
And the next weak point will probably the hash database.<br>

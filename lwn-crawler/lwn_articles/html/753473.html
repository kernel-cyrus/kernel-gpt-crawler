<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt></a>
system call suffers from a number of different shortcomings that has led
some to consider a different API.  At last year's Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM), that someone was
Miklos Szeredi, who led a <a href="/Articles/718638/">session</a> to discuss his
ideas for a new filesystem mounting API.  Since then, David Howells has been
working with Szeredi and VFS maintainer Al Viro on this API; at the 2018
LSFMM, he presented that work.
</p>

<p>
He began by noting some of the downsides of the current mounting API.  For one
thing, you can pass a data page to the <tt>mount()</tt> call, but it is
limited to a single page; if too many options are needed, or simply options with
too many long parameters, they won't fit.   The error messages and
information on what went wrong could be better.  There are also filesystems
that have a bug 
where an invalid option will fail the <tt>mount()</tt> call but leave the
superblock in an inconsistent state due to earlier options having been applied.
Several in the audience were quick to note that both ext4 and XFS had fixed
the latter bug along the way, though there may still be filesystems that
have that behavior.
</p>

</a>

<p>
There are also problems with the in-kernel parameter passing using the data
page, Howells continued.  For example, a namespace cannot be turned into a
string, which is what would be needed to pass a namespace option.  Right
now, the namespaces are inherited from the parent filesystem, but
automounts should inherit the mount and network namespace from the process
that caused the mount.
</p>

<p>
In the kernel, the first step of mounting is to create a
filesystem 
context, which is represented by a <tt>struct&nbsp;fs_context</tt>.  It is
an internal kernel structure that can be initialized and used directly by
in-kernel users, but will be created by the filesystem drivers for
user-space callers.  It contains a bunch of different fields, including
operations for parsing and validating options, filesystem type, namespace
and security information, and more.  More information can be found in a 
 <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit/?h=mount-context&id=4abb974e22eabf14090f89dea5b6a0d6a58bf278">commit</a>
 in Howells's Git repository for this work.
</p>

<p>
Viro suggested that it may be useful to think of the filesystem drivers as
external servers; they may actually reside in the kernel (or not) but
mounting is making a request to these servers.  A user-space caller would
get a file descriptor by calling <tt>fsopen()</tt>, then write options and
configuration information to that file descriptor, followed by a "create"
command that would generate the superblock and root directory.  Howells has
<a href="/Articles/753570/">working code</a> for something like the following:
<pre>
    fd = fsopen("nfs", 0);
    write(fd, "d server:/dir");
    write(fd, "o tcp");
    write(fd, "o intr");
    write(fd, "x create");
</pre>
That would create the context for an NFS filesystem on "server" with two
options (TCP transport and interruptible operation).  The final write is
what actually creates the context.  The context can be used to mount the
filesystem with a call like:
<pre>
    fsmount(fd, "/mntpnt", flags);
</pre>
The flags for <tt>fsmount()</tt> would govern options, such as
<tt>nodev</tt> and <tt>noexec</tt>, and propagation attributes like
"private" and "slave".  Options for <tt>fsopen()</tt> might include things
like UID/GID translation tables for network filesystems like NFS and to
eliminate the need for something like <a
href="/Articles/687354/">shiftfs</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There would also a new system call (<tt>fspick()</tt>) for doing superblock
reconfiguration for remounting, bind mounting, and so on.  That is Howell's
idea, anyway; Viro has suggested several new calls, such as
<tt>mount_new()</tt>, <tt>mount_clone()</tt>, and <tt>mount_move()</tt> to
handle that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
Howells was asked about what would happen with the existing mount API.  It
would remain available, though it would likely eventually be switched to an
implementation on top of the new API.  It is not likely that it could ever
be removed entirely.  So far, he has added filesystem context handling for
most of the internal filesystems (e.g. procfs, sysfs, and kernfs) as well
as NFS and AFS.  But, he warned, that bikeshedding is always going to be a
problem for patches of this nature.

I haven't read the implementation yet but I sincerely hope that there's O_NOFOLLOW equivalent for the fsmount() and friends. Having to work around the fact that it doesn't exist is perhaps fun, as in creative exercise, but it certainly feels like busywork that should be avoided by making mount smarter.<br>

That's a symptom of a larger problem; *all* the documentation I could find for NFS seems to be 10-12 years out of date. I had to set up NFSv4 by basically trolling in comments until people corrected me.<br>

<p>
Freezing seems to be on the minds of some kernel hackers these days,
whether it is the northern summer or southern winter that is causing it is
unclear.  Two recent patches posted to linux-kernel look at freezing,
suspending essentially, two different pieces of the kernel: filesystems and
containers.   For containers, it is a step along the path to being able to
migrate running processes elsewhere, whereas for filesystems it will allow
backup systems to snapshot a consistent filesystem state.  Other than
conceptually, the patches have little to do with each other, but each is
fairly small and self-contained so a combined look seemed in order.
</p>

<p>
Takashi Sato <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287242/">proposes</a> taking
an XFS-specific feature and moving it into the filesystem code.  The patch
would provide an <tt>ioctl()</tt> for suspending write access to a
filesystem, freezing, along with a thawing option to resume writes.  For
backups that snapshot the state of a filesystem or otherwise operate
directly on the block device, this can ensure that the filesystem is in a
consistent state.
</p>

<p>
Essentially the patch just exports the <tt>freeze_bdev()</tt> kernel
function in a user accessible way.  <tt>freeze_bdev()</tt> locks a file
system into a consistent state by flushing the superblock and syncing the
device.   The patch also adds tracking of the frozen
state to the <tt>struct block_device</tt> state field.  In its simplest
form, freezing or thawing a filesystem would be done as follows:
<pre>
    ioctl(fd, FIFREEZE, 0);

    ioctl(fd, FITHAW, 0);
</pre>
Where fd is a file descriptor of the mount point and the argument is ignored.
</p>

<p>
In another part of the patchset, Sato adds a timeout value as the argument
to the <tt>ioctl()</tt>.  For XFS compatibility&mdash;though courtesy of a
patch by David Chinner, the XFS-specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> is
removed&mdash;a value of 1 for the pointer argument means that the timeout
is not set.  A value of 0 for the argument also means there is no timeout,
but any other value is treated as a pointer to a timeout value in seconds.
It would seem that removing the XFS-specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> would break
any applications that currently use it anyway, so keeping the compatibility
of the argument value 1 is somewhat dubious.
</p>

<p>
If the timeout occurs, the filesystem will be automatically thawed.  This
is to protect against some kind of problem with the backup system.  Another
<tt>ioctl()</tt> flag, <tt>FIFREEZE_RESET_TIMEOUT</tt>, has been added so
that an application can periodically reset its timeout while it is
working.  If it deadlocks, or otherwise fails to reset the timeout, the
filesystem will be thawed.  Another <tt>FIFREEZE_RESET_TIMEOUT</tt> after
that occurs will return <tt>EINVAL</tt> so that the application can
recognize that it has happened.
</p>

<p>
Moving on to containers, 
Matt Helsley posted a <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287241/">patch</a>
which reuses 
the software suspend (swsusp) infrastructure to implement freezing of all
the processes in a <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/256389/">control group</a> (i.e. cgroup).
This could be used now to 
checkpoint and restart tasks, but eventually could be used to migrate tasks
elsewhere entirely 
for load balancing or other reasons.  Helsley's patch set is a forward port
of work originally done by Cedric Le Goater.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to make the freeze option, in the form of the
<tt>TIF_FREEZE</tt> flag, available to all architectures.  Once that is
done, moving two functions, <tt>refrigerator()</tt> and
<tt>freeze_task()</tt>, from the power management subsystem to the new
<tt>kernel/freezer.c</tt> file makes freezing tasks available even to
architectures that don't support power management.
</p>

<p>
As is usual for cgroups, controlling the freezing and thawing is done
through the 
cgroup filesystem.  Adding the <tt>freezer</tt> option when mounting will
allow access to each container's <tt>freezer.state</tt> file.  This can be
read to get the current freezer state or written to change it as follows:
<pre>
    # cat /containers/0/freezer.state
    RUNNING
    # echo FROZEN > /containers/0/freezer.state
    # cat /containers/0/freezer.state
    FROZEN
</pre>
It should be noted that it is possible for tasks in a cgroup to be busy
doing something that will not allow them to be frozen.  In that case, the
state would be <tt>FREEZING</tt>.  Freezing can then be retried by
writing 
<tt>FROZEN</tt> again, or canceled by writing <tt>RUNNING</tt>.  Moving the
offending tasks out of the cgroup will also allow the cgroup to be
frozen. If the 
state does reach <tt>FROZEN</tt>, the cgroup can be thawed by writing
<tt>RUNNING</tt>.
</p>

<p>
In order for swsusp and cgroups to share the <tt>refrigerator()</tt> it is
necessary to ensure that frozen cgroups do not get thawed when swsusp is
waking up the system after a suspend.  
The last patch in the set ensures that <tt>thaw_tasks()</tt> checks for a
frozen cgroup before thawing, skipping over any that it finds.
</p>

<p>
There has not been much in the way of discussion about the patches on
linux-kernel, but an ACK from Pavel Machek would seem to be a good sign.
Some <a href="/Articles/287500/">comments</a> by Paul Menage, who developed
cgroups, also indicate interest in seeing this feature merged.

Jake,

I think you misunderstood what we did with the XFS ioctls
and FIFREEZE/FITHAW. The XFS ioctls only got "removed" because
FIFREEZE/FITHAW replace them by having the same value as
the XFS ioctls. i.e.:

+#define FIFREEZE       _IOWR('X', 119, int)    /* Freeze */
+#define FITHAW         _IOWR('X', 120, int)    /* Thaw */

-#define XFS_IOC_FREEZE              _IOWR('X', 119, int)
-#define XFS_IOC_THAW                _IOWR('X', 120, int)

Hence any application using the XFS ioctls will continue to
work; they'll just vector through the FIFREEZE/FITHAW
code instead of directly into XFS. That means special handling
of the known arg values to the XFS ioctls needs to remain, despite
it appearing like it's a different interface.

I guess I did misunderstand, thanks for the correction!  So, XFS_IOC_FREEZE and THAW still
exist in the user space headers?  So applications that use them don't have to change at all?

I plead lack of coffee for the previous comment.  Existing binaries will still work with the
changes made is your point.  And that's why the compatibility of the argument value needs to
be maintained.

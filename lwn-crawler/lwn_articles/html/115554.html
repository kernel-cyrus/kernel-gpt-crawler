<h1>Boot-time clock frequency selection</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted December 14, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The timer interrupt is the kernel's way of keeping track of the passage of
time.  Every so often, a programmable timer interrupts the kernel, which
responds by updating its internal time value, performing various
housekeeping tasks, and executing any delayed kernel work whose time has
come.  In the 2.6 kernel, on the x86 architecture, by default, the timer
interrupt comes 1000 times per second; other architectures and
configurations can vary.
<p>

Playing with the timer tick frequency is almost as old as the kernel
itself.  The frequency with which the hardware timer interrupts the
processor is well parameterized into a single compile-time variable
(<tt>HZ</tt>); running the system with a nonstandard clock frequency is
simply a matter of changing the definition of <tt>HZ</tt> (within
reasonable bounds) and building a new kernel.
<p>

There are legitimate reasons for playing with the timer frequency.  A
faster clock can allow the system to perform more precise delays, and to
respond to events more quickly.  Systems running at a higher clock
frequency should have lower latencies in many situations.  There is an
overhead associated with the timer interrupt, however; a higher-frequency
interrupt will take more CPU time.  So, for server loads (where latency is
less important), the overhead of a higher timer frequency is not worth it.
On laptops, the default 1KHz timer can also defeat the CPU's power management
features and significantly reduce battery life.
<p>

In other words, there is no single value for the timer frequency which
works for all users.  Changing the frequency is still relatively hard,
however; some people are more comfortable with building new kernels than
others.  Wouldn't it be nice if the frequency could be made into a
boot-time parameter, so that it could be changed from one boot to the next
without a kernel rebuild?
<p>

As it turns out, Andrea Arcangeli has <a href="/Articles/115285/">a
patch</a> which does exactly that.  It's not even a new patch: SUSE has
been shipping 2.4 kernels with boot-time timer frequency selection for some
time.  Andrea is now interested in merging this patch into the mainline,
should the other developers be willing.
<p>

The patch is relatively intrusive - it touches 143 files around the tree.
The core change is the transformation of <tt>HZ</tt> from a constant value
into a variable.  Much of the kernel does not notice the change at all; a
call like:
<p>
<pre>
    schedule_timeout(HZ/10);
</pre>
<p>

will still set up a wakeup for 100ms in the future.  There is some new overhead
associated with fetching the value of <tt>HZ</tt> and performing the
division at run time, but Andrea states that it is not really measurable.
<p>

There are places in the kernel which require further changes, however.
Compile-time initializations which depend on a constant <tt>HZ</tt> value
will no longer work; those initializations must be moved to run time, or
recast in terms of a known constant value.  There are also places where
values in timer-tick units are provided by user space.  The kernel tries to
hide its internal clock frequency from user space, but there are still
places where it leaks through.  A number of boot-time parameters are
expressed in ticks, and some device drivers take parameters in ticks as
well.  
<p>

To address these problems, Andrea's expands the use of a symbol called
<tt>USER_HZ</tt>.  It is a constant value, though its actual definition is
architecture dependent, varying from 32 to 1200 - though most architectures
set it to 100.  All remaining compile-time initializations, and all values
obtained from user space, are interpreted as being in <tt>USER_HZ</tt> and
must be translated to internal values before being used.  To that end, some
new macros have been provided:
<p>
<pre>
	jiffies_to_clock_t(internal_hz);
	user_to_kernel_hz(user_hz);
</pre>
<p>

With these in place, it's just a matter of keeping track of which type of
clock value is being used where.  Andrea's patch renames variables
containing user-space tick values (it prepends "<tt>__</tt>" to the name)
as a way of indicating that a special value is contained there.
<p>

Andrew Morton has <a href="/Articles/115565/">said</a> that some form of
this patch is likely to be merged:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So I guess we're going to have to do this sometime - I don't think
	there's any other solution apart from going fully tickless, which
	would be considerably more intrusive.
</div>
<p>

Before the patch can be merged, however, a few details must be dealt with -
porting it from 2.4 to 2.6, for example.  So it's unlikely to go in
immediately.  Given time, however, it seems likely to be merged in some
form.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Once this is finished, the next step is obvious: make it fully dynamic!  A daemon could watch the system shift between I/O and interactive use and adjust HZ to fit (similar to speedfreq et al).<br>

Scary...<br>

      The Real Next Step would be to totally get rid of the timer interrupt, and thus have the processor really sleeping when the system is idle. There have already been some patches on lkml a while ago, I don't remember why they were not merged but I liked the idea very much.<br>

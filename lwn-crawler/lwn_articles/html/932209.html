A complete stack trace is needed for a number of debugging and optimization
tasks, but getting such traces reliably can be surprisingly challenging.
At the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Steve Rostedt and Indu Bhagat
described a mechanism called SFrame that enables the creation of reliable
user-space stack traces in the kernel without
the memory and run-time overhead of some other solutions.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/932213/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/SteveRostedt-sm.png" alt="[Steve Rostedt]"
title="Steve Rostedt" class="lthumb"></a>

Rostedt began by saying that obtaining a full stack trace of a user-space
process is useful for a number of purposes.  It is needed for accurate
profiling, so both perf and ftrace make use of stack traces.  BPF programs,
too, can benefit from a picture of the state of the call stack.
<p>
The traditional way to reliably obtain stack frames is to build the program
in question with frame pointers.  The frame pointer is simply a CPU
register that is dedicated to containing the base address of the current
stack frame.  That frame will include a saved copy of the previous frame
pointer, indicating where the previous frame began.  The kernel (or any
other program) can thus follow the chain of frame pointers to locate each
frame on the stack.  If frame pointers are not present, instead, the
kernel's perf subsystem must, at each event, copy a lot of the stack for
later postprocessing using the DWARF unwinder.  That is a costly thing to
do.
<p>
But frame pointers are not free either.  Managing the frame pointer
requires some setup code to run at the entry to every function.  Using a
register for the frame pointer makes a scarce CPU register unavailable for
other uses, slowing program execution.  As described in <a
href="/Articles/919940/">this article</a>, building user space with frame
pointers can lead to measurable performance regressions, which can cause
their use to be controversial.
<p>
The kernel, Rostedt continued, has a stack unwinder called <a
href="/Articles/728339/">ORC</a> that is much simpler than DWARF.  It was
added in the 4.14 release to support live patching â€” another application
that needs reliable stack traces.  The kernel's <tt>objtool</tt> utility
creates the ORC data at build time and adds two tables to a section in the
kernel executable: <tt>orc_unwind</tt> to hold stack-frame information, and
<tt>orc_unwind_ip</tt> to map instruction pointer values to the appropriate
unwind entry.
<p>
SFrame is based on ORC; it provides the same mechanism, but for user space
rather than the kernel.  When an executable is built with SFrame data, the
kernel can create full stack traces without the need for frame pointers.
There is always a cost, of course; in this case, developers are sacrificing
a bit of disk space (to hold the ORC tables) for speed.  This data is read,
if needed, in the kernel's <tt>ptrace()</tt> path, so it doesn't affect
execution when it is not needed.  Some additional effort was required to
handle some user-space complications; for example, since binaries are
relocatable, there must be a mechanism to apply the correct offsets to the
SFrame data.
<p>
Rostedt provided an overview of how SFrame support would work in the
kernel.  The generation of a perf event starts with a non-maskable
interrupt (NMI), which ends up in the perf code.  If a stack trace is
called for, then the kernel will make an attempt to read the call stack; if
that encounters a page fault, then there will be no stack trace for this
event.  He would like to change that code to look for the SFrame data
instead.  The NMI handler would set a flag indicating that there is work to
be done before returning to user space; the <tt>ptrace()</tt> path would
see that flag and reconstruct the stack trace in user context.  Among other
things, that would make it possible to recover the stack even if page
faults occur while reading it.
<p>
This approach would require some changes to the user-space perf tool as
well.  The initial perf event, generated at NMI time, will not include the
call stack (which will not be obtained until later), so it will, instead,
have a bit set saying "a stack trace is coming".  There may be several
intervening events generated before that stack trace finally shows up in
the ring.  Joel Fernandes asked whether the kernel could just reserve space
in the ring buffer at NMI time, then fill it in later.  Rostedt answered
that the ring may end up with multiple events all with the same stack
trace; reserving that space for each would end up wasting space.
<p>

Rostedt concluded his part by saying that the stack is unlikely to be
swapped out, so generating the trace will not normally create I/O to fault
pages back in.  That said, generating the trace will need to bring in some
other data, since the SFrame tables are stored in the executable on disk.
The SFrame data should only be mapped when it is actually used, so the
first use within a process will cause a brief stall while that mapping
takes place.
<p>
Bhagat (who has done <a
href="/ml/linux-toolchains/20230501200410.3973453-1-indu.bhagat@oracle.com/">much
of the work</a> to implement this functionality) said that there could
perhaps be a problem with code in parts of the kernel that are written in
assembly.  The non-standard stack usage in that code may well confuse the
unwinder.  It remains to be seen whether unwinding through those parts of
the kernel is important, she said.
<p>
Another potential issue is that the SFrame data is stored unaligned on the
disk; that can lead to unaligned memory accesses in the kernel.  Avoiding
that requires a certain amount of copying of data, "weird casts", and such.
The alternative, forcing the data to be aligned, would bloat the format
though.  There seemed to be agreement that storing the data unaligned is
the best solution, and that there was no need to change it.
<p>
Other outstanding problems include the need to handle <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html"><tt>dlopen()</tt></a>,
which maps executable text from another file into a range of the calling
process's memory.  This issue could perhaps be addressed by adding a system
call to tell the kernel where the SFrame data for a given executable
mapping can be found.  Just-in-time compiled code is also a problem; when
there is no backing file for a mapping, there is no SFrame data either.
<p>
As the session concluded, the sentiment in the room seemed to be that
SFrame would be a nice tool to have and that this work should continue.

It's worth noting that SFrame is renamed from CTF Frame, which caught me off guard.<br>
<p>
This is such an exciting project, it's the "have your cake and eat it, too" approach to stack unwinding. No extra code generated for frame pointers, no wasted register or icache. But still reliable unwinding without relying on the full DWARF debuginfo.<br>
<p>
Hopefully this becomes standard along with CTF for lightweight introspection. Programs may want to unwind their own stack or examine the layout of data structures, so there's already good use cases. What's more, debuggers can do a lot with a symbol table, a reliable unwinder, and the basic information about types provided by CTF. While dwarf is better suited for development tasks, these smaller formats could fill a nice for basic diagnostics in production environments where debuginfo isn't available.<br>

You can already emit partial DWARF debuginfo that supports stack unwinding but not other debugging features. Has anyone compared SFrame to that?<br>
<p>
I'm worried that people who want to build binaries with full debugging information or just stack traces with parameter values are going to have to build even *bigger* binaries with both DWARF and SFrame information.<br>

Uninformed guess: One would assume that the big difference then is whether you unwind when the sample comes (i.e., in the kernel; SFrame), or whether you snapshot the entire top of the stack to unwind later (i.e., in userspacer; DWARF). The DWARF standard is complex enough that I don't think anyone really wants to parse it in the privileged context of the kernel, even if one happens to use only a subset of it. Plus it can be in a separate dbgsym file, which has all sorts of other implications around needing userspace helpers?<br>

DWARF is indeed incredibly complex. It is basically a turing complete stack machine that can run arbitrary computations. It has to be able to do this to be able to reverse arbitrary compiler optimizations for debugging. For a trivial example, while your code may declare a pointer, the compiler might actually store it as an offset from another pointer instead. In that case some simple addition will do, but this gets a lot more complicated when you stack layers of optimizations, computations that end up being eliminated due to inlining, VLAs, varargs, etc. Answering what the value of a variable is accurately might require substantial emulation of your code.<br>
<p>
I don't know how much of this is needed to only do unwinding, but the idea of DWARF in the kernel is a very spooky prospect to me.<br>

I wonder if it'd be practical to generate the SFrame data from the DWARF data on the fly in userspace, and then present it to the kernel - probably a lot of work the first time a particular executable was processed, but it'd be fairly easy to cache it.<br>
<p>
I think it'd be pretty similar to the dlopen() scenario, except that instead of just pointing at existing SFrame data for the object it'd generate the data from another source first.<br>

Ah, so close. Now, if we were to do the unwinding in a signal handler instead of hard coding SFrame, as I've proposed previously, we'd at last have fully general stack unwinding after all <br>

<p>
I'm not sure what this means. The mechanism for unwinding (in-kernel, copies to userspace, whatever) is orthogonal to the format being used (DWARF, SFrame, ORC): they can presumably all be unwound using code running in many contexts. They're just formats after all.<br>
<p>
But... in general in a signal handler you can't do anything useful involving the process you're running inside -- in particular you can't use stdio or allocate memory and more or less arbitrary locks might be taken out, and that's when nothing has gone wrong: and if you're backtracing quite often it's because all hell has broken loose and the program might be in any state at all. glibc removed the machinery that gave (fp-based) backtraces on stack-protector failure for a reason.<br>
<p>
One attractive-sounding alternative suggested at a past LPC is to use a coredump handler: that is given an image of as much or as little of the process as you wish to configure (this stuff is customizable in /proc) and can do whatever it wants because it's a completely separate process that nothing has gone wrong with and which isn't in a signal handler and has no unexpected locks or half-completed mallocs fouling things up. But a signal handler? The more you do with signals, the more pain you'll eventually be in, and that goes double if the process is halfway through crashing!<br>

Obviously care needs to be taken with the code you write in a signal handler, but that doesn't mean they're not useful, and they're definitely not only useful for a crashing process. At the company I work for we use setitimer with ITIMER_PROF, and in the SIGPROF signal handler we unwind the stack following frame pointers up to 48 frames deep, and these are written into a fixed-size circular ring buffer, so we have the last ~10s of profile data in memory at all times. None of this requires using stdio or memory allocation or anything else unsafe. There is some slightly tricky locking logic for reading/writing the ring buffer (when we dump profiles from the buffer we need to make sure it doesn't race with the signal handler), but it isn't rocket science.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Other outstanding problems include the need to handle dlopen(), which maps executable text from another file into a range of the calling process's memory.</span><br>
<p>
Why would this problem be specific to dlopen()? ISTM it's the same for any dynamically-linked executables (even if they don't use dlopen()). Dynamic linking happens in user space, so the kernel currently learns about libraries only indirectly (by seeing them mmap'ed for execution).<br>

It's not specific to dlopen(). It was just that dlopen() is probably the most known and easiest to explain the issue.<br>

Just a note: the SFrame format is not based on ORC at all (it has rather different goals: simplicity of reading is there, but compactness is valued higher than ORC, plus of course it's targetting representing stacks for all of userspace rather than purely the kernel). The implementation happens to use the same in-kernel API, but that's because it has to: that's the API the in-kernel users are using.<br>

In theory, DWARF-based EH_Frame information is a superset of information in SFrame (the former has information to restore complete register state as well).<br>

<p>
The commonality between SFrame and ORC is that both encode the stack offsets directly. But beyond that, there are enough divergences between the two formats making them quite different - SFrame is generated by the toolchain, has support for AMD64 and AArch64 (AAPCS64), has compactness related optimizations in its on-disk representation; ORC is designed to work for the kernel stack tracing use case.<br>
<p>
Just saying..."SFrame is based on ORC" can be misleading.<br>

Fair enough, but the point was that ORC was mostly a proof of concept that this works, and it works well. As live kernel patching depends heavily on accurate stack traces and it uses ORC unwinding for that. The point was that sframes uses the same concept. But it all really depends on what your definition of "based on" is.<br>

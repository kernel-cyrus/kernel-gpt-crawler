           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 4, 2014</br>

Numerous attempts to improve the power efficiency of the kernel's CPU
scheduler have been made in recent years.  Most of these attempts have taken the
form of adding heuristics to the scheduler ("group small tasks onto just a
few CPUs," for example) that, it was hoped, would lead to more efficient
use of the system's resources.  These attempts have run aground for a
number of reasons, including the fact that they tend to work for only a subset
of the range of workloads and systems out there and their lack of
integration with other CPU-related power management subsystems, including
the CPU frequency and CPU idle governors.  At the <a
href="/Articles/571414/">power-aware scheduling mini-summit</a> in 2013, a
call was made for a more organized approach to the problem.  Half a year or
so later, some of the results are starting to appear.
<p>
In particular, Morten Rasmussen's <a href="/Articles/600135/">Energy cost
model for energy-aware scheduling patch set</a> was posted on May&nbsp;23.
This patch set is more of a demonstration-of-concept than something
suitable for merging, but it does show the kind of thinking that is going
into power-aware scheduling now.  Heuristics have been replaced with an
attempt to measure and calculate what the power cost of each scheduling
decision will be.
<p>
The patch set starts by creating a new data structure to describe the available
computing capacity of each CPU and the power cost of running at each
capacity.  If a given CPU can 
operate at three independent frequencies, this data structure will contain
a three-element array describing the power cost of running at each
frequency and the associated computing capacity that will be available.
There are no specific units associated with either number; as long as they
are consistent across the system, things will work.
<p>
On a simple system, the cost/capacity array will be the same for each CPU.
But things can quickly get more complicated than that.  Asymmetric systems
(big.LITTLE systems, for example) have both low-power and high-power
CPUs offering a wide range of capacities.  On larger systems, CPUs are
organized into packages and NUMA nodes; the power cost of running two CPUs
on the same package will be quite a bit less than the cost of keeping two
packages powered up.  So the cost/capacity array must be maintained at
every level of the <a href="/Articles/80911/">scheduling domain</a>
hierarchy (which matches the hardware topography), and scheduling decisions 
must take into account the associated cost at every level.
<p>
In the current patch set, this data structure is hard coded for a specific
ARM processor.  One of the many items on the "to do" list is to create
this data structure automatically, either from data found in the firmware
or from a device tree.  Either way, some architecture-specific code will
have to be written, but that was not a problem that needed to be solved to
test out the concepts behind this patch set.
<p>
With this data structure in place, it is possible to create a simple
function:
<p>
<pre>
    int energy_diff_util(int cpu, int utilization);
</pre>
<p>
The idea is straightforward enough: return the difference in power
consumption that will 
result from adding a specific load (represented by <tt>utilization</tt>) to
a given CPU.  In the real world, 
though, there are a few difficulties to be dealt with.  One of those is
that the 
kernel does not really know how much CPU utilization comes with a specific
task.  So the patch set has to work with the measured load values, which
are not quite the same thing; in particular, load does not take a process's
priority into account.  
<p>
Then there is the little problem that the scheduler does not actually know
anything about what the CPU frequency governor is doing with any given
CPU.  The patch set adds a hack to make the current frequency of each CPU
available, and there is an explicit assumption that the governor will make
changes to match utilization changes on any given processor.  The lack of
integration between these subsystems was a major complaint at last year's
mini-summit; it is clearly a problem that will need to be addressed as part
of any viable power-aware scheduling patch.  But, for the time being, it's
another detail that can be glossed over while the main concepts are worked
out.
<p>
There are a number of factors beyond pure CPU usage that can change how
much power a given process needs.  One of those is CPU wakeups: taking a
processor out of a sleep state has an energy cost of its own.  It is not
possible to know how often a given process will awaken a sleeping CPU, but
one can get an approximate measure by tracking how often the process itself
wakes up from a sleeping state.  If one assumes that some percentage of
those wakeups will happen when the CPU itself was sleeping, one can make a
guess at how many CPU wakeups will be added if a process is made to run on
a given CPU.
<p>
So Morten's patch set adds simple process wakeup tracking to get a sense
for whether a given process wakes up frequently or rarely.  Then, when the
time comes to consider running that process on a given CPU, a look at that
CPU's current idle time will generate a guess for how many additional
wakeups the process would create there.  A CPU that is already busy most of
the time will not sleep often, so it will suffer fewer wakeups than one
that is mostly idle.  Factor in the energy cost of waking the CPU (which
will depend on just how deeply it is sleeping, another quantity that is
hard for the scheduler to get currently) and an approximate energy cost
associated with wakeups can be calculated.
<p>
With that structure in place, it's just a matter of  performing the
energy calculations for each possible destination when the time comes to
pick a CPU for a given task. 
Iterating through all CPUs could get expensive, so the code tries to
quickly narrow things down to one low-level group of CPUs; the lowest-cost
CPU in that group is then chosen.  In this patch set,
<tt>find_idlest_cpu()</tt> is modified to do this search; other places
where task placement decisions are made (load balancing, for example) have
not been modified.
<p>
The patch set came with a small amount of benchmark information; it shows
energy savings from 3% to 50%, depending on the workload, on a big.LITTLE
system.  As Morten notes, the savings on a fully symmetric system will
be smaller.  There is also an approximate quadrupling of the time taken to
switch tasks; that cost is likely to be seen as unacceptable, but it should
also be possible to reduce that cost considerably with some targeted
optimization work.
<p>
Thus far, discussion of the patch set has been muted.  Getting sufficient
reviewer attention on power-aware scheduling patches has been a problem in
the past.  The tighter focus of this patch set should help to make review
relatively easy, though, so, with luck, this work will be looked over in
the near future.  Then we'll have an idea of whether it represents a viable
path forward or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

After read these articals about power-aware scheduling, I strongly feel that without hardware's help, the problem cannot be solved elegantly.<br>
Hardware is keeping change, we cannot guarantee our plan will still suitable in the future. To that end, how about we built a feedback mechanism? These information is needed:<br>
1. The current power consumption of CPUs.<br>
2. The current processes' information (How many? How to group their vitality?)<br>
3. The knowledge -- With the current processes's information, what's the power consumption it will be? <br>
With all of these, we should be able to generate a suggestion to the scheduler.<br>

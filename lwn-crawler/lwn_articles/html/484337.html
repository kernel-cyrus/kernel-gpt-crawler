Back in October 2011, the Long-term Support Initiative (LTSI) was <a
href="/Articles/464834/">announced</a> at the LinuxCon Europe event by
Linux Foundation board member (and NEC manager) Tsugikazu Shibata.  Since
that initial announcement, a lot has gone on in the planning stages of
putting the framework for this type of project together, and at the
Embedded Linux Conference a few weeks ago, the project was publicly
announced as active.
<p>
Shibata-san again presented about LTSI at ELC 2012, giving more details
about how the project would be run, and how to get involved.  The <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/images/stories/pdf/lf_elc12_shibata.pdf">full
slides for the presentation [PDF]</a> are available online.
<p>

The LTSI project has grown out of the needs of a large number of consumer
electronic companies that use Linux in their products.  They need a new
kernel every year to support newer devices, but they end up cobbling
together a wide range of patches and backports to meet their needs.  At
LinuxCon in Europe, the results of a survey of a large number of kernel
releases in different products showed that there are a set of common
features that different companies need, yet they were implemented in
different ways, pulling from different upstream kernel or project versions,
and combining them in different kernel versions with different bug fixes,
some done in opposite ways.  <a
href="http://kernel.operationaldynamics.com/yaminabe/">The results of this
survey</a> are now available for the curious.
<p>

This is usually done because of the short development cycle that consumer
electronic companies are under in order to get a product released.  Once a
product is released, the development cycle starts up again, and old work is
usually forgotten, except to the extent that it is copied into the new
project.  This cycle is hard to break out of, but that needs to happen in
order to 
be able to successfully take advantage of the Linux kernel community's
releases.
<p>

The LTSI project's goals were summarized as:
<ul>
<li> Create a longterm community-based Linux kernel to cover the
   embedded life cycle.
<li> Create an industry-managed kernel as a common ground for the
   embedded industry.
<li> Set up a mechanism to support upstream activities for embedded
   engineers.
</ul>
<p>
Let's look at these goals individually, to find out how they are going
to be addressed.
<p>

<h4>Longterm community kernel</h4>
<p>
A few months ago, after discussing this project and the needs of the
embedded industry, I announced that I will be maintaining a longterm
Linux kernel for bugfixes and security updates for two years after it
was originally released by Linus.  This kernel version will be picked
every year, enabling two different longterm kernels to be supported at
the same time.  The rules of these kernels are the same as the normal
stable kernel releases, and can be found in the in-kernel file
<a href="/Articles/484478/">Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt</a>.
<p>

The 3.0 kernel was selected last August as the first of these longterm
kernels to be supported in this manner.  The previous longterm kernel,
2.6.32, which was selected with the different enterprise Linux distributions'
needs in mind,  will still be maintained for a while longer as they rely
on this kernel version for their users.
<p>
As the 3.0 kernel was selected last August, it looks like
the next longterm kernel will be selected sometime around August, 2012.
I've been discussing this decision
with a number of different companies about which version would work well
for them, and if anyone has any input into this, please let me know.

<p>
<h4>Longterm industry kernel</h4>
<p>
As shown at LinuxCon Europe, basing a product kernel on just a
community-released kernel does not usually work.  Almost all consumer
electronics releases depend on a range of out-of-tree patches
for some of their features.  These patches include the Android kernel patch
set,
LTTng, some real-time patches, different architecture and
system-on-a-chip support, and various small bugfixes.  These patches,
even if they are accepted upstream into the kernel.org releases, usually
do not fit the requirements that the community stable kernel releases
require.  Because of that, the LTSI kernel has been created.
<p>
This kernel release will be based on the current longterm community-based
kernel, with a number of these common patchsets applied.  Applying 
them in a single place enables developers from different companies to be
assured that the patches are correct, they have the latest versions,
and, if any fixes are needed, they can be done in a common way for all
users of the code.
This LTSI kernel tree is now public, and can be browsed at

<a
href="http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=ltsi-kernel.git">http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=ltsi-kernel.git</a>.
[Editor's note: this site, like the LTSI page linked below, fails badly if
HTTPS is used; "HTTPS Everywhere" users will have difficulty accessing
these pages.]
It currently contains a backport of the Android kernel patches, as well
as the latest LTTng codebase.  Other patches are pending review to be
accepted into this tree in the next few weeks.
<p>
This tree is set up much like most distribution kernel trees are: a set
of quilt-based patches that apply on top of an existing kernel.org
release.  This organization allows the patches to be easily reworked, and even
removed if needed; patches can also be forward-ported to new kernel
releases without 
the problems of rebasing a whole expanded kernel git tree.  There are
scripts in the tree to generate the patches in quilt, git, or just
tarball formats, meeting the needs of all device manufacturers.
<p>
During the hallway track at ELC 2012, I discussed the LTSI kernel with a
number of different embedded companies, embedded distributions, and
community distributions.  All of these groups were eager to start using
the LTSI kernel as a base for their releases, as no one likes to do the
same work all the time.  By working off of a common base, they can then
focus on the real value they offer their different communities.
<p>

<h4>Upstream support for embedded engineers</h4>
<p>
Despite the continued growth of the number of developers and companies
that are contributing to the Linux kernel, some companies still have a
difficult time of figuring out how to get involved.  Because of this, a
specific effort to get embedded engineers working upstream is part of
the LTSI project.
<p>
The LTSI kernel will accept patches from companies even if they contain code
that does not meet the normal acceptance criteria set by Linux kernel
developers due to technical reasons.  These patches will be cleaned up
in the LTSI kernel tree and helped to be merged upstream by either
submission to the various kernel subsystem groups, or through the
staging subsystem if the code will need more work than a simple cleanup.
This feedback loop into the community is to help these embedded
engineers learn how to work with the community, and in the end, be part
of the community directly, so for the next product they have to create,
they will not need to use the LTSI kernel as a "launching pad".
<p>

<h4>Help make the project obsolete</h4>
<p>

The end goal of LTSI is to put itself out of business.  With companies
learning how to work directly with mainstream, their patches will not
need the help of the LTSI developers to be accepted.  And if those
patches are accepted, their authors will not have to maintain them on their own
for their product's lifetime; instead, they can just rely on the community
longterm kernel support schedule for the needed bugfixes and security
updates.  However, until those far-reaching goals are met, there will be
a need for the LTSI project and developers for some time.
<p>
If you work for a company interested in working with the LTSI kernel as
either a base for your devices, or to help get your code upstream,
please see <a href="http://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/">the LTSI web site</a>

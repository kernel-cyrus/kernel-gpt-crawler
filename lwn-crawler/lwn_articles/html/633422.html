<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 16, 2015</br>
           </div>
Epoll is a set of Linux-specific system calls intended to provide fast
polling for large numbers of file descriptors.  The API has been in use
since it was merged during the 2.5 development series but, like many
interfaces, there is always room for improvement.  There are currently two
patch sets making the rounds that would add functionality to this set of
system calls.
<p>
<h4>An epoll overview</h4>
<p>
Epoll is designed to function somewhat like <tt>select()</tt> or
<tt>poll()</tt>, but with more options and with higher performance when
large numbers of file descriptors are in use.  Each call to
<tt>select()</tt> or <tt>poll()</tt> can involve an entirely new set of
file descriptors, so the kernel must go through the process of validating
each one, checking for I/O readiness, and adding the polling process to the
appropriate wait queue.  But the actual list of file descriptors tends not
to change much between calls, so much of that work is unnecessary
duplicated effort.  The epoll calls get around this problem by separating
that setup work from the act of waiting for a file descriptor to become
ready.
<p>
A process using this API must begin by creating a special file descriptor
to use with polling; that is done with a call to one of:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;

    int epoll_create(int size);
    int epoll_create1(int flags);
</pre>
<p>

Either call will return a file descriptor to be used with the remaining
epoll functions.  The <tt>size</tt> parameter to <tt>epoll_create()</tt> is
no longer used; the <tt>flags</tt> argument added for
<tt>epoll_create1()</tt> can 
be used to set the close-on-exec flag for the resulting file descriptor.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
The next step is to add all of the file descriptors that are to be
monitored, using:
<p>
<pre>
    int epoll_ctl(int efd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);
</pre>
<p>
If <tt>op</tt> is <tt>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</tt>, the given <tt>fd</tt> will be
added to the set.  The <tt>event</tt> parameter is used to describe which
events will be polled for; see <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html">the man
page</a> for details.  <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> can also be used to remove file
descriptors or to modify how the polling is done.
<p>
Finally, actually waiting for one of the file descriptors in the set to
become ready is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);
    int epoll_pwait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout,
                    const sigset_t *sigmask);
</pre>
<p>
The events that cause <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> to return (up to
<tt>maxevents</tt>) will be stored in the
<tt>events</tt> array; the <tt>timeout</tt> parameter is specified in
milliseconds.  The <tt>epoll_pwait()</tt> version also allows the
specification of a set of signals to be blocked (or unblocked) during the
call.  Again, see <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html">the man
page</a> for details.
<p>

<h4>epoll_ctl_batch() and epoll_pwait1()</h4>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/633195/">This patch set from Fam Zheng</a> introduces two
new system calls to the epoll family.  The first of these addresses a
performance problem that comes up in situations where it is often necessary
to make changes to the file descriptors in the epoll set.  A call to
<tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> can only add, modify, or delete a single file
descriptor; if a lot of descriptors need to be changed, there will need to
be a lot of <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> calls to get that work done.  The proposed
<tt>epoll_ctl_batch()</tt> system call gets around that problem by processing
multiple file descriptors in a single call:
<p>
<pre>
    int epoll_ctl_batch(int epfd, int flags, int ncmds, struct epoll_ctl_cmd *cmds);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>cmds</tt> structure essentially duplicates all of the arguments
that would have been passed to an <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> call.  By passing an
array of these structures, a program can perform operations on multiple
file descriptors with a single system call.
<p>
Fam's other change is to add a new system call to perform the actual
polling:
<p>
<pre>
    struct epoll_wait_params {
	int clockid;
	struct timespec timeout;
	sigset_t *sigmask;
	size_t sigsetsize;
    };

    int epoll_pwait1(int epfd, int flags,
                     struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents,
                     struct epoll_wait_params *params);
</pre>
<p>

This version of <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> adds a new <tt>flags</tt> parameter,
but does not define any flag values, so <tt>flags</tt> must be zero.  The
parameters shuffled off into the <tt>params</tt> structure are mainly
intended to give the application more control over timeout processing.  The
millisecond-resolution timeout understood by <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> has
proved to be too coarse for a number of use cases.  The new system call
defines a timeout with nanosecond resolution, getting around that problem. 

<p>

<h4>Better multi-threaded behavior</h4>
<p>
Jason Baron (of Akamai) has run into a different problem that only comes up
with a relatively uncommon usage pattern.  Normally, there will only be one
process using a polling function to monitor a given file descriptor.  But,
in Jason's use case, there can be multiple threads, each of which is using
epoll to track the same set of file descriptors.  In this setting, an event
on any given file descriptor will cause <i>all</i> of the waiting processes
to wake up, even though only one of them will be able to actually handle
the event.  This thundering-herd problem is something that Jason would like
to avoid.
<p>
His response is <a href="/Articles/632590/">this patch</a> adding a couple
of new flags to be attached to file descriptors via <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt>.
The first of these, <tt>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</tt>, requests that only one process
be woken up to handle an event on the associated file descriptor.
Internally, the change is a simple matter of using
<tt>add_wait_queue_exclusive()</tt> instead of <tt>add_wait_queue()</tt>
when setting up the polling.  Obviously, all processes polling the same
file descriptor would have to use the exclusive mode to get down to a
single wakeup per event.
<p>

That change did not entirely solve Jason's problem, though, in that it
ended up with the same process waking up in response to each event.  Since
one of the reasons for epoll's existence is to allow processes to be left
on all of the file-descriptor-specific wait queues between calls to
<tt>epoll_wait()</tt>, the process that is at the head of any given queue
will remain there.  It will thus be the one to receive all of the exclusive
wakeups.  But the whole point of having multiple processes polling the same
file descriptor is to spread the work around; waking the same process every
time thwarts that objective.  To deal with that, Jason added another flag,
called <tt>EPOLLROUNDROBIN</tt>, that causes the kernel to work through
each of the polling processes in turn.

<p>
Support for this mode was added to the scheduler in the form of a new wait
queue function:
<p>
<pre>
    void add_wait_queue_rr(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t *wait);
</pre>
<p>
When waiting is done using <tt>add_wait_queue_rr()</tt>, only a single
process will wake, just like with <tt>add_wait_queue_exclusive()</tt>.
But, in addition, the process at the head of the wait queue will be moved
to the tail, so it will not see another wakeup until all of the other
processes have had their turn.
<p>
Jason's patch posting includes results from a little benchmark program
showing a nearly 50% reduction in execution time when the exclusive mode is
used.  When there are a lot of wakeups happening (as can be the case for
many network-oriented workloads), the extra overhead caused by thundering
herds can be crippling.
<p>

Both patches have received a fair number of review comments, and Fam's
patches in particular have evolved quite a bit since <a
href="/Articles/630097/">the first posting</a> in January.  Your editor's
unscientific impression is that API-related patches are getting more
attention than they once did.  That, of course, would be a good thing; APIs
live forever, so it's better to get them right before shipping them to
users and being committed to supporting them forever.  These patches seem
close to being ready, though; they might make an appearance in the next
merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      That question was raised during the discussion; it seems to be a (valid) way of partitioning the load across a large system.

Interesting. It seems like it might also be useful to take advantage of receive flow steering to preferentially wake up a thread running on the same core that is handling the kernel-side packet processing. Of course, this won't always work (i.e., the user-mode processing is taking up 100% of that core), but it could provide some nice additional throughput thanks to cache locality.<br>

But I wonder why thread N is less appropriate than that N+1 (or any other one) just because thread N already handled the last poll event(s). To me it seems that all threads that call epoll() are equally appropriate regardless the past, because all of them are equally idle waiting for I/O events. I mean, what is the technical rationale here to prefer switching threads when there is barely enough work for one?<br>
<p>
But I can fully understand that waking only one thread can give better results than waking all threads, if only one can successfully respond to the event anyway.<br>

Because if you have N file descriptors that are ready, all of them gets signaled on the same thread.  Instead, with round-robin the behavior is more random.<br>

I can't understand this feature, either.<br>
<p>
If you have multiple threads waiting on the same event, then presumably you're using EPOLLONESHOT. If you're not, then you're going to have races when you close a descriptor, whether or not you're using a mutex to synchronize operations on whatever object the descriptor is associated with.[1]<br>
<p>
If you're using EPOLLONESHOT, that means the event is disabled until the edge condition trigger is re-armed, which means only one thread would ever dequeue the event. So why shouldn't EPOLLEXCLUSIVE already be the default behavior for EPOLLONESHOT?<br>
<p>
The only situation where the above assumptions don't hold is calling accept(2). In a multi-threaded environment you definitely don't want to use EPOLLONESHOT, because you don't want the thread that woke up to dequeue _all_ incoming connections. However, the recent SO_REUSEPORT patch solved that particular problem. (See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/">https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/</a> although the per-file descriptor queue is annoying because if a thread or process exits you drop any connections in the queue--a shared queue would be much nicer.)<br>
<p>
Plus, it you're only waking up one thread, that means latency will suffer, because the event won't be attended until that thread is finished with other work. If you're not worried about latency, why are you sharing events among multiple threads? Why not assign an event to a single thread from the very beginning? In such a case the round-robin behavior makes even less sense.<br>
<p>
Really shouldn't the behavior for EPOLLEXCLUSIVE (and EPOLLONESHOT, for that matter) be to wake up the _first_ thread that's sleeping on the wait queue, and no others?<br>
<p>
[1] Unless you go out of your way to make sure a quiescent period has elapsed, such as making sure every thread has be woken up once from epoll_wait after you deleted the descriptor from the epoll queue, and before you close the descriptor.<br>

You can reduce the severity of those races on descriptor close to merely looking like a spurious event -- which is generally fine, because there are little to no guarantees that you wont get spurious edges.<br>
<p>
All you need to do is freelist the structure you hand off to epoll. If that structure is still on the freelist when that extra event comes in, then great, no problem. If it has been reassigned, the event on the old file descriptor just looks like an event on the new one.<br>

Perhaps it is now (finally) standard practice for syscall additions, but I would still like to applaud Fam Zheng for including a proposed man page along with the actual code. If nothing else, it sets a good example for others to follow!<br>

Since the addition of timerfd we've had the ability to have nanosecond resolution timeouts in epoll.  I suppose this simplifies things a little, but it wasn't hard to put a timerfd in your epoll set.<br>

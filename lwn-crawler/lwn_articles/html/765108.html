<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 18, 2018</br>
           </div>
A couple of surprising things happened in the kernel community on
September&nbsp;16: Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/764901/">announced</a>
that he was taking a break from kernel development to focus on improving
his own behavior, and the longstanding "code of conflict" was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f">replaced</a>
with a code of conduct based on the <a
href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct">Contributor
Covenant</a>.  Those two things did not quite come packaged as a set, but
they are clearly not unrelated.  It is a
time of change for the kernel project; there will be challenges to overcome
but, in the end, less may change than many expect or fear.
<p>
<h4>Some time off</h4>
<p>
Torvalds has always been known as a harsh critic; what perhaps fewer people
have seen is that he has always been willing to be just as harsh toward
himself when (in his opinion) the situation warranted it.  He has seemingly
come to the conclusion that some self-criticism is indeed called for now:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This week people in our community confronted me about my lifetime
	of not understanding emotions.  My flippant attacks in emails have
	been both unprofessional and uncalled for.  Especially at times
	when I made it personal.  In my quest for a better patch, this made
	sense to me.  I know now this was not OK and I am truly sorry.
</div>
<p>
Torvalds went on to say that he will be taking a break from kernel work at
least through 
the end of the 4.19 development cycle — which should come in around four
weeks.  Greg Kroah-Hartman will be handling pull requests during this time;
he has already done a number of pulls as of this writing.  
Torvalds, meanwhile, will "<q>get some assistance on how to understand
people’s emotions and respond appropriately</q>".  He expressed a strong
wish to continue leading the kernel project once things settle, and said
that he was "<q>looking forward</q>" to meeting with the maintainer
community at the Maintainers Summit at the end of October.
<p>
As for what brought this moment about, we may never know for sure.  He
talks about being confronted by members of the community, but people have
been telling him for years that some things should change.  If somebody did
get through to him this time, they did it privately.  In any case, we seem
to have arrived at, as Torvalds put it, one of "<q>the inflection points where
development flow and behavior [change]</q>".  Sometimes,
perhaps, it really is just a matter of waiting for the right moment when
change becomes possible.
<p>
The response to this announcement on the net as a whole has, as one might
imagine, covered a wide spectrum.  Some people like Torvalds just as he is
and do not welcome any change, while others are quick to say that he is
beyond redemption and probably cannot change.  Most people, though, seem to
recognize an individual confronting some internal pain and are waiting
hopefully to see what comes next.   We wish him the best and look forward to
his return.
<p>
<h4>A new code of conduct</h4>
<p>
Critics of the kernel community have spent years calling for the
establishment of a proper code of conduct.  The <a
href="/Articles/635999/">adoption</a> of a "code of conflict" in 2015 did little to
mollify those critics, many of whom saw it as, at best, an empty gesture
that would 
change little.  Judging three years later whether they were right is harder
than one might think.  There is little in the way of hard evidence that the
code of conflict brought about any changes in behavior.  On the other hand,
the kernel community continues to grow, and most of the approximately 4,000
people who contribute each year have a fine experience.  The web sites that
specialize in publicizing inflammatory messages found in the mailing lists
have had to dig harder than in the past.  Perhaps the code of conflict helped to
moderate behavior a bit, or perhaps we are just seeing the slow, long-term trend
toward professionalism that has been evident in the community for at least
two decades.
<p>
Attentive readers will note that my name appears as one of the signoffs on
the patch adding the new code of conduct; they might wonder why I chose to
do so despite my beliefs that (1)&nbsp;the situation is not as bad as many
like to portray it, and (2)&nbsp;things are getting better anyway.  Over the
last weekend, I was informed that there was a window of opportunity to
change the code and given the chance to comment on the new one.  How or why
this window came to be is still not entirely clear; I did
<i>not</i> know about Torvalds's plans until I read the
announcement along with everybody else.  I saw the new code as a way of
encouraging the community's slow drift toward greater civility.  It was not
the code I would have written, but I agree with the principles expressed
there and believe that it can be adopted and used in the pragmatic manner
in which the community approaches most problems.
<p>
One of the strongest criticisms against the old code of conflict is that it did
not enumerate the types of behavior that are unwelcome.  The new one
cannot be criticized on that account.  Such laundry lists of misbehavior
can leave a bad taste in the mouth; that can be especially true if, like
me, you are an older, run-of-the-mill white male; it is easy to look at a
list like that and say "everybody is protected except me".  It can look,
rightly or wrongly, like a threatening change pushed by people with a
hostile agenda.

<p>
But the purpose of such a code is not to threaten anybody; indeed, it is
the opposite.  It is a statement that we all have the right to be who we
are and participate in the community as equals without having to contend
with bullying, abuse, and worse.  Posting a patch should not be a
frightening experience.  The code of conduct is a way of saying that, if we
drive away 
contributors with a hostile environment, we don't just impose a personal
cost on those contributors; we also make ourselves weaker as a community.
Not even the kernel community, which still attracts at least 200 first-time
contributors in each development cycle, is so rich that it can afford to
lose talent in that way.
<p>
I can also understand a hostility to rules.  I grew up in a small Wyoming
town that had a sign reading — literally — "Population: 35".  There is
little need for formal rules in such a place; there are no strangers and
everybody knows that they have to get along for many years into the
future.  Every such town has some eccentric and difficult personalities;
people learn how to cope with them.
<p>
Cities do not run the same way, though; cities need rules.  There are too
many people coming from too many different backgrounds to just get along
without some sort of framework.  The kernel community is the free-software
equivalent of a city at this point.  It has grown hugely, and is divided
into a number of neighborhoods, some of which are rather friendlier than
others.  Many bad experiences reported by developers are associated with
crossing into a new neighborhood and unwittingly violating one of the norms
in place there.  There is a place for some city-wide rules on how we deal
with each other so that such bad experiences become much rarer.
<p>

The early O'Reilly books about Linux, <a href="/Kernel/LDD3/">including
mine</a>, used a wild-west cover theme for a reason.  But the kernel
community is not the wild frontier that it was back then; it has become a
far more disciplined, professional, and even welcoming place.
In the end, my hope in signing off on the new code of conduct was that it
would drive home the point that we are no longer the wild west, that it
would encourage further progress toward civility and professionalism, and
that it would help the kernel community continue to scale into the future.
Those of us who work on the kernel tend to be in it for the long term; we
want the community ten years from now to be better than what we have now,
because we expect to still be a part of it.
<p>
<h4>Hazards</h4>
<p>
One need not look far to find predictions of doom in many flavors.  Some,
seemingly including <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041503445025468416">the
author of the Community Covenant</a>, think that the kernel community may
be a lost cause.  There is, among some people, a
sort of hostility toward the 
kernel community that brings a special toxicity of its own; there is little
to be 
done about that.  On the other hand, plenty of people — generally not those
with a lot of contributions to their credit — claim that the adoption of a
code of conduct will force developers out and be the beginning of the end
of the kernel project.  Now that the 
"social justice warriors" have taken over, the real developers will flee
and it will all collapse into a heap.
<p>
That outcome seems unlikely, but there will indeed be challenges in
adopting this code in such a large community. 
The nature of kernel development requires relatively high levels of
pushback on code submissions, many of which will not be merged in anything
resembling their current form.  It attracts passionate developers with
strong opinions 
who do not always understand the need to create a kernel that works for a
huge and diverse set of users.  It attracts developers who are trying to
solve problems above their technical ability — perhaps at the direction of
their employers.  Kernel developers care deeply about the kernel itself and
are unwilling to stand by idly if they see changes that threaten to make
the kernel worse.  And the kernel, perhaps more than any other project, is
surrounded by a vocal community of onlookers with opinions on every move the
community makes.  These are all the makings of a relatively high level of
conflict.
<p>

The community as a whole will have to find a way to implement the code that
handles the community's inherent conflicts without collateral damage.  
It is thus unhelpful that it was adopted so abruptly, without a
community-wide discussion; that will not sit well with some
developers.  It would have almost certainly been better to go more slowly,
and involve at least the invitees to the Maintainers Summit; on the other
hand, any public discussion would have had a high probability of being an
unpleasant experience for everybody involved.  
<p>

It seems almost certain that some people will try to test the boundaries of this
code and its enforcement mechanisms in an attempt to show which effects it
will (or will not) have.  Neither the boundaries nor the consequences for
crossing them are particularly well specified at this
point.  Some parts of the code do not entirely seem to fit; it's not clear
that the kernel project can even have an "official
social media account" or an "appointed representative", for example.  Those
who end up enforcing this code will have to handle complaints with great
care, protecting members of the community while fending off those who
might, as some seem to fear, attempt to use the code to further an
unrelated agenda.
<p>
The written code was changed with a single patch;
implementing that code may be a rather longer and harder process.  Like the
kernel's out-of-memory killer, the code of conduct might be seen as a
collection of heuristics that never quite converge on what is really
wanted.

<p>
That said, the chances are that what will emerge from the dust will be
something that looks like the same kernel community that has achieved so
much in the last 27 years.  Only hopefully it will be a bit friendlier, a
bit more diverse, and much stronger.  This could indeed be one of those
inflection points mentioned by Torvalds in his announcement; the kernel has
always emerged from those episodes stronger than ever.  It is hard to see
any reasons why this time should be different.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Some guidance might come if someone were to take a look at other projects and how they have fared before and after the adoption of codes of conduct, and especially this specific code.  After all, who cares if it's a "nicer project to work for" if the code falls apart because many of the key developers found themselves on the wrong side of the code?<br>

      This CoC has been adopted by numerous other projects, so examples of departures and reduction in code quality should be easy to come by, if that occurs.  The Django project is only one I know of that publishes <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/master/statistics.md#statistics">stats</a>, and there does not appear to be a mass departure due to bans from the CoC.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; But what about Django code quality? And Drupal comes to mind, as well.</font><br>
<p>
Indeed, what about code quality? I'm a longtime user of Django, and in my opinion its quality has not decreased; it has not affected me as a user.<br>
<p>
I don't follow the Django development discussions. Maybe you do, and have noticed such decline/evidences for it? A link would be welcome, I'm most curious.<br>
<p>
The only complaint about Django is about it being bloated, and/or slow. That might be true, but as far as I know, that's not a consequence of adopting a CoC; it has always been Django's philosophy to offer a fully integrated environment. The Django community has banned 3 people, total, in 3 years. I really doubt that has an impact on the project at any level. But I would welcome any evidence to the contrary. <br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
All in all, the whole "now that there is CoC in place the project will lose in technical quality, top contributors who are brash/abrasive/etc. will leave" gives these "people who might leave because of the CoC" too much (technical) credit, too little (emotional) credit in their capabilities to learn and understand and empathize with their peers, and also fails to consider the (lost) contributions of people who have been driven away by the unwelcoming environment in the kernel community.<br>

There is some support for the idea that public discussion of grievances is better than suppressing of them.<br>
<p>
However I don't think this document as written attempts to suppress that at all, it merely says that you really shouldn't troll and swear and ad-hominem while doing that. <br>
<p>
You could try to suggest that such documents correlate with an attempt to suppress public discussion of greivances, but I would challenge that you really need evidence to make such claims.<br>

And that's *ALL* I asked for.  Personally, from the outside looking in, I didn't see any issue with Linus' behavior.  The developer community for the kernel seemed to still be growing, development of new features was happening apace - I didn't see any significant numbers of people throwing up their hands in public and saying "I can't work like this."  But of course, like the use of handguns to prevent a crime, it's pretty much impossible to judge whether or not people were never bothering to start kernel developing because of Linus' behavior.  The *only* way to judge is by comparing before and after records, which is what I asked about.  Someone brought up Django, I mentioned Drupal as a highly public case where someone was kicked out of a community for activities that (as far as I could tell) didn't actually take place within that community...  But I'm sure there's a lot of other communities that have switched to this and found things changed either for the better, or for the worse - or the interesting cases, where as far as anyone can tell, the community didn't change at all after adding a CoC (which would be illuminating in its own way - if the CoC doesn't change anything, why bother?)<br>
<p>
Oh, yeah - one other case comes to mind - the recent Lerna license flap, where the CoC was actually used to kick the guy out who changed the licensing.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure how the minor flap in the Python community over the push to eliminate the terms "master" and "slave" is going - I found it interesting to see this arise once more after the first time it came around in reference to PATA IDE drives.  Still, someone was apparently pushing against it on "diversity" grounds - they have something against the BDSM community?  That seems a remarkably undiverse definition of diversity.<br>
<p>
I'm just really not sure of the utility of these things.  They just seem like one more set of rules to be used to play "gotcha" with.<br>

      Read the recent article <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/764325/">Trying to get STACKLEAK into the kernel</a> for an example of Linus' behavior causing problems.  People who are trying to solve tough problems in contentious areas shouldn't have deal with torrents of personal abuse, and rigorous code review does not require it.

I think this is a case of the seriousness of the insult depending on cultural signifiers (and knowledge of Monty Python, I guess, though it appalls me to realise that Monty Python is now a historical artifact like Shakespeare or Chaucer that not everyone can be expected to have word-perfect as a matter of course.)<br>

I'm with you.  In fact, I'd go even further and wish that more discourse was this direct and obvious.  Maybe Linus lacks tact.  I'm probably the same, but I *know* I often don't get the point on the receiving end simply because I'm corresponding with someone who uses too much tact.<br>

Seriously? That's "emotionally abusive"?<br>
<p>
That's not emotionally abusive, it's direct. In a huge project people need to be told "no" sometimes in a manner that lets them know it's not okay.<br>
<p>
I've seen people in the workplace who don't learn because nobody is willing to be "mean". Sometimes you need to be "mean". Feeling bad is part of growing up and improving yourself. It's incentive. If everyone just tells you "it's okay" nothing changes, you just coast along thinking that it's okay if you mess up or do something wrong or stupid, because there's no consequence.<br>
<p>
Negative emotions are not to be dispensed with. You *should* feel bad sometimes. It's a critical part of the human experience.<br>

I think these are appropriate, not abusive.  They are "I" statements.  Linus. it talking about how he feels.  This is always a reasonable thing to do.  If hearing about Linus' feelings makes you upset, then that really is your problem, not his.<br>
<p>
The previous sentence:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Dammit, have you learnt *nothing*?</font><br>
<p>
Isn't an "I" statement, so it would probably have been better to leave it out.  However it is phrased as a question, not as an attack, so it should not be too hard to read it objectively, and respond to it accordingly.<br>

Honestly that line seems like one of the most hurtful things I've seen cited in these comments. The implication is clearly that Kay *hadn't* learned anything, out of negligence or stupidity or whatever.<br>
<p>
I don't know whether Linus can distinguish hurtful things from non-hurtful things (his statement about stepping away "to learn about human emotions" suggests that he thinks he can't), but it's clear that many people in this space lack this ability (I don't mean you, just in general). It's interesting to read comments like these because helps me, and hopefully others, to see what this distinction is, because it's often unclear over text and across cultures.<br>
<p>
It's also interesting to see mainstream reporters, whose job it is to communicate, get this wrong. For example, I think counting f-bombs or slurs is a total red herring, and I also think any derogatory terms about *code* rather than *people* are fine. (Though in fairness, the latter point is somewhat unique to open source development -- it is definitely not true in most cultures that you can criticize someone's work, even on purely technical grounds, and expect it to be non-personal.)<br>

Thanks - that's really valuable and on-point.  I genuinely didn't think that line would be very hurtful at all, but clearly not everyone shares my opinion.<br>
This re-enforces the importance of not saying anything personal, even if I think it should be harmless (address the code, not the coder).<br>
Hopefully it is OK to say personal things when they are positive: "You did a good job, thanks!" ????<br>

It is, but then, why are they "afraid" of rejection?<br>
<p>
"Good enough to work", "good enough to ship" and "good enough to be included upstream" are three different technical thresholds. It is quite possible that many or most people "afraid of rejection" are aware that their code isn't up to the required quality.<br>

<p>
Don't forget "good enough to be accepted by whoever's in charge of upstream," because that's not the same as "good enough to be included upstream."  A potential contributor may be afraid that his perfectly good work would not be acknowledged as such.  Thus, it could be a truly emotional "afraid" based on lack of validation by another human being as well as a practical "afraid" just meaning you don't want to risk wasting your time.
<p>
I had many patches I thought were great rejected by various projects - some just ignored, others explicitly rejected, which led to a decision many years ago just to keep my code to myself from now on.

It's not clear to me that "Afraid of rejection" means they are personally worried about a rude or abusive response - if I was answering that survey, I'd interpret it as simply a rational concern that I might put a lot of effort into upstreaming my work and then it's still not good enough and gets rejected so I get no payoff for my effort. I'm just afraid of wasting my company's time. But it's hard to tell exactly what was meant without more context.<br>

As the author of the survey, I can say that the survey was not given in the context of querying for abusive behavior.  I do not believe it can be used as evidence of the number of people who have been abused.  Here is the wording that was used:<br>
<p>
12. Please think about a single change that you made to the Linux kernel, that you did NOT submit upstream. Please answer the following questions to describe your reasons for NOT submitting your change:<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
15. My change was not good enough to submit to upstream (e.g. it was a quick hack or workaround, not suitable for upstream).<br>
Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree<br>

16. I was afraid my patch would be rejected.<br>

The Rust community copped a lot of flak for adopting a code of conduct, and the project still gets criticized for it by the "anti-SJW" crowd, but their predictions of doom don't seem to have borne fruit. It's hard to guess what would have happened in other possible universes, of course.<br>

Though I think it's fair to say that an insufficiently high bar to accepting contributions (one of the feared results of a CoC) is NOT one of the problems Rust has. If anything I think Rust has the opposite problem, that they spend too much time and energy searching for the perfect solution to each problem so it takes too long for features to mature.<br>

Here's one data point. As community manager I introduced a code of conduct to the openSUSE conference and was involved in shaping the wider community guidelines. They never had any adverse affect that I could see despite indeed quite some pushback at the time.<br>
<p>
The guidelines were used once to push someone out, which had an amazingly positive effect: that person was clearly keeping many others from contributing with their bad behaviour. In hindsight I should have acted far sooner and in the future, when encountering a toxic person, I certainly will. Heck, I have, though mostly I could fix issues by a stern talking-to rather than kicking. But having a CoC to point to and as stick behind the door is very useful. I know several people who don't attend events without one and while as boring white dude I never bothered to look myself if an event had one I fully support that.<br>
<p>
Talk to community managers. I bet you won't find one who thinks a CoC does anything other than grow the community. <br>

The code of conduct doesn't really deal with things like this. This person made it pretty clear that they are not part of the Linux development community and are using a private Twitter account to make the derogatory comment in question.<br>

If anything, it's perhaps a matter of Twitter terms of use; but my guess is that they're okay with it. They're okay with nuclear threats anyway.<br>

The important point is that this is not a CoC complaint in the first place. The person is complaining that there is somebody on the TAB who they surmise cannot deal with certain types of (hypothetical, so far) CoC complaints fairly. This contention is debatable, but it does not invalidate the concept of having the TAB handle CoC complaints in principle. If nothing else, the TAB member in question (who is known as a reasonable sort of guy) could recuse himself from dealing with that particular type of complaint if and when any specimens actually come in, and they could be handled by the remainder of the TAB. If, in the longer term, enough people object to his presence on the TAB on these grounds they could simply elect somebody else when his seat comes up the next time.
</p>
<p>
Now of course one can discuss whether the TAB is best placed to handle CoC complaints to begin with, but it's fairly obvious that the TAB ended up as arbiters of CoC disputes because the CoC template had a blank to fill in and the TAB was the only body that was immediately available to fill that blank. For all the criticism concerning its (current) composition, the TAB has at least been elected rather than arbitrarily appointed, even if it may not be the most appropriate institution for the job in the long term. But I wouldn't consider its role cast in stone.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of principle, it would probably be better to have a specialised “CoC oversight committee” that is trusted by the kernel development community to adjudicate disputes fairly, but it is by no means clear who should even be allowed to vote in an election for that body if “whoever is attending the kernel summit” is not what is wanted as the electorate. How many lines of code must one have contributed to the current Linux source tree in order to be eligible to vote? (Actually conducting the vote once you know who gets to vote wouldn't be a huge problem; the Debian project does it at least once every year.)

Yeah - that phrasing is more than a bit unfortunate.  It implies that this period was somehow special - and the only special thing about it I see is that Linus was stepping away - therefore, the idea that if Linus actually knew about it, he would object, but that he'd just have to live with it if it was done before he came back.<br>

      Um...if you look at the patch adding the code, you will see that it carries Linus's signoff.  Did you really think people would try to sneak in something like that behind his back?
<p>
I did not know it at the time, but what made the period "special", as far as I can tell, is that Linus wanted to have a new CoC in place when he made his announcement.

Actually yes that appears to be the conspiracy theory that the alt-right/anti-sjw people are currently throwing around at Slashdot and Phoronix, that Linus was forced out by the powers that be in order to inforce full on SJW takeover. Just shows how little they know about Linus I guess, but then there are a wide audience that do not know him so the conspiracy can perhaps get a foothold...<br>

Actually, the theory I heard floated was that it was less a specifically SJW take-over, though some might see that as a bonus, and more an opportunity to get Linus out of the way, whether temporarily or permanently, so that a stable binary interface might be put in place to allow Intel and others to side-step the GPL and lock down machines even more thoroughly than they are.  However, Linus *does* personally own the Linux trademark, so that might affect things.<br>

The 7 sign-offs on the commit include 6 out of 10 members of the technical advisory board (TAB), which the text tasks with enforcing the code: &lt;<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/technical-advisory-board/">https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/technical-advisory-...</a>&gt;.<br>

It seems reasonable to conclude that the TAB was informed of the change beforehand, which is appropriate because otherwise they may end up having a responsibility they did not agree to. (Note, the description page conspicuously lacks any mention of how this body is formed or renewed.)<br>

      <p>I think that Linus's personal behavior will be far more important than a written code of conduct in determining how the community works in practice.  No matter what it says, the code of conduct is meaningless without enforcement.  If Linus comes back from his time away with a real commitment to making the kernel community a more welcoming place, things will change.  Even if he back slides, if people can successfully call him out for it, things will change.  If he comes back and maintains the same old behavior, the code of conduct will turn out to be just another failed experiment that resulted in some dead code.

Even more important than Linus' personal behavior will be the behavior of those who take their lead from Linus. The code of conduct is a pledge that every contributor and maintainer makes, not just Linus.<br>

      <blockquote>I do not expect him to return a “new man”.</blockquote>

<p>I don't expect him to return a new man, at least in the sense that his behavior will completely change.  But there's a lot of space between completely changed and completely unchanged.  The biggest question is how sincerely he wants to change.  I'm sure there will be plenty of people on LKML willing to remind him when he slips up.  But the question is how he'll respond when that happens.  If he's really committed to changing, he'll admit his mistakes and try to do better.  If he changes his mind and decides things are fine as they are, he'll resist.

I'm 50, and I'm still able to change. You're right. I doubt he'll come back as a "new man". But he'll come back as one that is more aware of his actions, and how they affect others. He'll still slip. He'll still  say something that is probably very offensive. The difference is that we can tell him that what he said was over-the-top and I believe he'll step back, apologize, and try to do better.<br>
<p>
Outside of computer conferences, I suck at social norms. I have to constantly be aware and think of what to say before saying it, where others just know how to act. My wife will poke me if I slip and start speaking without analyzing how it will be interpreted by others. I've gotten much better at knowing how to communicate without being offensive. I'm still working on it, and I have more to go.<br>
<p>
Point being, it's not about being a "new man", it's about actually wanting to be better. The "old Linus" didn't appear to care about changing his behavior. The "new Linus" does. That's a HUGE difference.<br>

<p>
A *lot* of what Linus says and does ranges between good and excellent.<br>
The number of times he uses inappropriate language are relatively few - but they have an effect out of proportion to their size (which is expected given Linus' power and position).<br>
<p>
So Linus doesn't need to become a "new man", he just needs a little bit of a shave - file down those few rough edges a bit.<br>

The way the old Code of Conflict was written was much more relevant to kernel development than the new Code of Conduct. It acknowledged conflict as an inherent part of kernel development and outlined how it should be managed. That should be the purpose of a "code of conduct" for a software project. The new CoC is generic and seems disconnected from the needs of the kernel community.<br>

I agree with Frogging101.<br>
<p>
In practice, I've seen CoCs like the one we are discussing be used to marginalize and eject good coders, and the very people doing that sort of thing were violating the CoC with their own behavior... but don't we all know that the rules don't apply to the SJW mobs.<br>

As a suggestion I recommend adopting the Contributor Code of Conduct to ensure everybody's contributions are accepted regarless of their sex, sexual orientation, skin color, religion, height, place of origin, etc, etc, etc. As a white straight male and lead of this trending repository, your adoption of this Code of Conduct will send a loud and clear message that inclusion is a primary objective of the Django community and of the software development community in general.<br>

And now it's the turn for Linux. This is what this and similar "Code of Conducts" are designed to do, and explicitly so by its creator. Create political Drama and arguments and get outside activists to start witch-hunts and Social media/media shitstorms against developers with private political opinions they dislike. It's up to the Linux community to decide if that's what they want or they'd rather keep coding.<br>
<p>
They're also implicitly anti-meritocratic and such language was embedded within the first versions of it, for instance "pervasive cult of meritocracy": <a href="https://twitter.com/dashorst/status/534473049647898624">https://twitter.com/dashorst/status/534473049647898624</a> and even if it's not explicit anymore, the intent of its creator is clear: <a href="https://postmeritocracy.org/">https://postmeritocracy.org/</a><br>

<p>
Just for the record, this has nothing to do with the Django project (a distinction that ESR himself was already careful to muddle when he pointed to that issue). The project in question here is <a href="https://gitlab.com/rosarior/awesome-django">awesome-django</a>, which is basically a list of useful Django resources that is quite distinct from the Django project itself.
</p>
<p>
If anything, the Django project is evidence that it is possible to produce best-of-breed software in the presence of a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">code of conduct</a> that is broadly similar to the one Linux has recently adopted.

It seems that people often use code reviews and technical disagreement as an example of what might stress a CoC, or cause conflict that violates it.  IMO, if a person can't review code or have technical disagreements without harassing somebody or creating an exclusionary environment, they shouldn't be reviewing code or having technical discussions.  <br>
<p>
There's a big difference between "This code isn't up to our standards, here's what you can do to fix it" or "I don't have time to help you fix this code, please look here&lt;link&gt; for guidance" and "this code is bad (and you should feel bad)".<br>

I raise this because I think this is an area that needs improvement, industry-wide.  The Linux kernel discussion isn't mostly full of the kind of condescension and de-valuation that is more common.<br>

One man's "pointlessly curt, needlessly rude" is another's review done quickly while under deadline because management, while saying code reviews are required, doesn't actually want to build time into the schedule for doing them.<br>

I agree.  I'm lucky that my current (also my first) software job is at a company that values friendliness and "playing well with others."  The harshest feedback I've received is "have you considered [better idea] instead?"<br>
<p>
OTOH I'm often hesitant to contribute to open source projects since I've seen enough examples of maintainers saying "this is stupid".  I'm sure most big projects won't respond that way to a new contributor, but seen small, one-person projects reject pull requests in a needlessly curt manner.<br>

Either you're one of the good devs that actually learn, or your reviewers are too soft. I try to give new hires the benefit of the doubt and give them plenty of leniecy on reviews at the beginning, and a good chunk of them actually do learn, but then there is the people who constantly need to be reminded of coding standards, and common patterns and worse, those reviews quickly go from "remind yourself of the coding standard" to "FIX", "FFS you know better", "go over the whole patch, im not wasting my time on the important bits when you cant even get formatting correct".<br>
<p>
My understanding of Linus (as an outsider) was that he was pretty easy going with new people who honestly were trying and only went aggressive with people who (in his opinion) should have known better, and if thats accurate then I'm guilty of the same. In the corporate world this ideally ends up with being managed out but you cant really do that in the OSS world.<br>

The examples chosen by Noam Cohen (linked below) would seem to corroborate JdGordy's impression: in <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75</a> , for instance, Linus was harsh on a person of relative power (a maintainer) to rescue the abused powerless (a bug reporter, userspace developers). Certainly this may make some power contributors uncomfortable, but it makes for a more inclusive community than projects where the non-maintainers are lumpenproletariat.<br>
<p>
Moral leadership works better when the leader shows they're ready to admit mistakes and improve. This positive example by Linus makes me hope he will return better and stronger.<br>
<p>
It's certainly a positive model for decisionmakers who don't admit mistakes or, even when admitting mistakes, don't ever show any sign of self-correction (e.g. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180914/10552840641/guy-charge-eu-copyright-directive-claims-he-didnt-know-what-he-voted-needs-to-fix-things.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180914/10552840641/gu...</a>).<br>

      I take your point about the "<i>laundry lists of misbehavior</i>", but the list in this CoC is pretty short.  More to the point, as a fellow white bloke of a certain age, I can't find anything in this list of example unacceptable behaviours that I would be happy to be subjected to.  If taking more care that I don't subject anyone else to such things is the price for not being subjected to them myself, I'm happy to pay it.

I agree with this. I think Jon should have gone further to criticise 'everybody is protected except me' by showing its wider context: the place in some 'worldwide pecking order' that being an intersection of white (e.g. from one list of traits coded by society to be desirable to undesirable) and male (another) and educated (another) and experienced with computers (yet another) is itself protection. When we're able to unpack and confront that thought, we can accommodate difference and override our unconscious biases to achieve the goal: getting the best code merged from whoever wrote it.<br>

Indeed. I would think the only white males who would feel targeted (or threatened?) by the enumerated list of bad behaviour are those who do not believe such behaviour is bad. Everyone else can probably benefit from having some things spelled out so that no one is surprised when a dispute arises. To me it reads as all very generic and applicable to everyone (though the first one might be construed as aimed at men more than women), with the fourth a particularly useful bit of etiquette that bears reinforcing.<br>

It's possible to fear being accused of bad behavior based on privilege etc without really understanding what that means.  I can see that as legitimately scary for some people.<br>
<p>
Thankfully, it's not very hard to learn about.  It should only remain a problem for those who don't really want to understand what it means.<br>
<p>
Also some people fear issues like this being raised in bad faith, and potentially use confirmation bias to convince themselves it's usually in bad faith.  I haven't really seen that happen in my personal reality though.<br>

I'm extremely unimpressed with the coverage of this topic. It feels a lot like Jon Corbet is too close to write a measured and well balanced article. I think the recent report on the stackleak talk by Jake Edge, or Jake Edge's write up of my LCA talk on the kernel community was a much better take, and greatly benefitted from a bit more distance in reporting.<br>

I'm not seeing any axe to grind here just an valid observation that I for example have observed as well that Jon's written articles in relation to the kernel community and it's communication problems sometime seem to be somewhat biased in the kernel's community favour due to his own personal relation and history with it  ( after all he is one of it's members so no surprice here ). <br>
<p>
It's just something that we ( we as in the entire human race ) have tendency to inadvertently do with matters we hold dear to us ( as in we have a hard time staying neutral ).<br>
<p>
Then he ( as in blackwood ) proposes someone else with less ties to the kernel community should cover those articles which is a perfectly valid point so I fail to see what axes are being grinded in his comment. <br>

      So this is obviously a personal story; I told it in the first person — something I rarely do on LWN — for a reason.  That said, I tried to be complete and fair.  If you find it biased, could you please help us to round it out by explaining what that bias is and where I failed to tell things properly?  I think we would all appreciate that.

I have to confess that reading this article also left me vaguely disappointed. Looking back on it perhaps I can make those feelings less vague for both of our benefits. As you may guess from my ✭ supporter ✭ tag, I have been a long-time fan of you and your work at LWN, ever since I first met you at LCA more than a decade ago. I really am trying to help.<br>
<p>
Let's start with this paragraph:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The adoption of a "code of conflict" in 2015 did little to mollify</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; those critics, many of whom saw it as, at best, an empty gesture</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; that would change little. Judging three years later whether they</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; were right is harder than one might think. There is little in the</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; way of hard evidence that the code of conflict brought about any</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; changes in behavior.</font><br>
<p>
The last sentence here seems to contradict the one immediately before it, making it sound like you just didn't want to admit that the critics were right. It is not until you read much further that you can figure out that what you were actually trying to say is that there may be *indirect* evidence that behaviors have been changing, but by that point the impression has already been made with the reader. The fact that the key word was "hard" was not obvious (especially since it was never explicitly contrasted with an antonym). I think this is mostly an editorial criticism, in that there was nothing wrong what you were trying to say, just that it was hard for me as a reader to figure out what that was.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; On the other hand, the kernel community continues to grow, and most</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; of the approximately 4,000 people who contribute each year have a</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; fine experience.</font><br>
<p>
These read like almost classical logical fallacies. Yes, the community continues to grow, but is that because of or in spite of its policies and cultural norms? No one has ever argued that Linux is not a successful project. It is also not surprising that the majority of the active contributors would not have issues to complain about, just due to survivor bias. The ones who did not have a fine experience would leave.<br>
<p>
But even beyond that point, to people like me who are not actually members of the kernel community and just follow along here on LWN because it is technically interesting, the majority of the discussion one has heard about that community in recent years is from those who were *not* having a fine experience. Now, maybe there is an argument there to be made that this has been sensationalized to generate headlines, but to state that "we're a big, happy, 4,000-person family just having a fine time" with no evidence to back that up makes me think, "Wow, this person has a very different image of that community than I do." A different image is okay (yours may be the right one! you are part of that community after all and I am not), but to leave out any justification for that viewpoint is to suggest that you either don't know what other people are saying about your community or that you don't want to acknowledge what they are saying. Even justifying this by drawing from your own personal experiences would have helped (since this article is told from a personal point of view, as you say). I would summarize this as a case of "telling instead of showing" being unconvincing.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The web sites that specialize in publicizing inflammatory messages</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; found in the mailing lists have had to dig harder than in the past.</font><br>
<p>
I didn't even know such websites existed (though it does not surprise me), but given the opposite impression I have received, that reporting on these issues is more common than ever (outside of LWN), some justification for this claim would have helped, also.<br>
<p>
But I think the bigger point, to me, is that regardless of how many incidences of Linus going postal on some poor contributor there actually are, the real issue has always been that he felt *entitled* to behave in that way, and that most of the other people in leadership positions within the Linux community were willing to back him up on that, or at least unwilling to challenge him on it. Nobody is perfect. I've had people call me out when I have acted badly in my own communities on occasion, but the difference is that those people were in positions of authority when they did it, and that I believed that they were right to do so. The "it's not that bad and it's getting better" line sounds like an abdication of the responsibility of those with actual power in the community to protect those who don't have it (as *people*), and that doesn't sit well with me, even if the line itself is true. You make many other excellent points in the article, and it was by no means one-sided. These were just some of the portions that I struggled with.<br>
<p>
Ultimately, the announcement that Linus no longer feels so entitled is a hugely positive development even if it results in no immediate changes in how the community works on a day-to-day level. I hope that in the long term the Linux community will find ways to achieve its technical excellence by growing and nurturing its members, and I hope that it will set a positive example for other communities struggling with the same issues. Like it or not, as one of the largest and most successful open source projects, Linux as a whole is also in a position of leadership in the broader community, and that is how leaders should behave.<br>

Linus mail is worth reading. It is a proof that you can convey your meaning, in a no bullshit manner, without having to be rude. Being polite doesn't edulcorate what you have to say. <br>
You can be prefectly frank and to the point AND act in a benevolent manner. There is no such thing as "ear candy".<br>
But the opposite is quite true, adding bad words or presonnal attack will just hide what you truly have to say.<br>

Thanks for "edulcorate": "make (something) more acceptable or palatable".<br>

Linus now enters a behavior modification loop.<br>

Hopefully this loop terminates, instead of having an infinite "you haven't been swell enough" condition.<br>

      <p>&gt; IMHO there is no big practical difference between old and new version of COC.</p>

<p>There is: the old CoC inputs penalties to the violators of the CoC. With the new one, maintainers become responsible for baby-sitting other behaviors:</p>

<p><q><i>Maintainers who do not ... <b>enforce</b> the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.</i></q></p>

<p>It gets worse: </p>

<p><q><i>applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.</i></q></p>

<p>So, if a random Kernel developer gets drunk and do something "not welcoming" on a random community event, even if thousands of miles away from current maintainers' location, a random maintainer can be punished, if it doesn't <b>enforce</b> the CoC.</p>

<p>I don't know a single maintainer that signed-up for baby-sitting grown ups.</p>

<p>&gt; Compared to other COC, e.g. , <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/765332/">https://lwn.net/Articles/765332/</a>, its simple and straightforward.</p>

<p>Nice document! Didn't read it until today.</p>

<p>I actually liked a lot more that PostgreSQL one, as it inputs penalties to the ones that violate the CoC, not the ones that don't have any relationship to a random abuser, except by eventually taking patches from him/her, when they're technically correct.</p>

<p>Another good thing is that it states two instances to judge misconducts: a comitte and a Core Team. It also defines an appeal process, where parts can defend themselves if they find the decision to be unfair.</p>

<p>Also, I have some doubts if the way we currently handle electronic emails on tags like Suggested-by would be possible without violating the CoC, as it defines electronic information as private information:</p>

<p><q><i>private information, such as a physical or electronic address</i></q></p>

 and say that publishing them is unacceptable:</p>
<p><q><i>
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:<br><br>...<br><br>
Publishing others’ private information ... without explicit permission</i></q></p>

      <p>You're missing the "in good faith" part. Its simply saying that if you try to <em>abuse</em> these rules, you can face consequences.</p>

<p>...For example, trying to get someone punished because they weren't <em>enforcing</em> the CoC, simply because you wanted to prove that the CoC, as you (mis)interpreted it, was terrible, <em>would be</em> a violation of the CoC. That would not be "enforc[ing] <em>in good faith</em>". (Just in case that was your cunning plan.)

I would think that is exactly the job of a maintainer: it's just a matter of what domains of behavior you need to baby sit - their code? Their behavior on a mailing list unrelated to code? Their behavior outside of the kernel community altogether? <br>
<p>
The line must be drawn somewhere, but, at some point, you are indeed baby sitting adults. Hopefully only in a very limited domain, though.<br>
<p>
I suppose you could be a maintainer that doesn't take responsibility "baby sit" for the patches submitted by other people, but you will either have terrible code or no contributors outside of yourself.<br>

For better and for worse, I really do not think this is special to computing, but more academia.<br>
<p>
It's a difficult space to apply safeguards to, or provide recourse for abuse. There are many essentially completely independent parties, and there's a relative lack of central mechanisms where cultural norms for interparty treatment can be hammered out or advanced.<br>
<p>
I have many personal stories from the realms of language study, music, astronomy, and other fields where people's careers were derailed by blatant sexism and other such unpleasantness.<br>
<p>
From my slightly greater visibility into the space of criminal justice, I think some of the baselines for behavior are leaking into at least conferences.  So I think there's hope.  I think many people in academia are coming to some of the same conclusions you are.<br>

I really hope so.  My occasional contact with other fields (field-work bio, archeology) give me hope. But I know how much work it is for me to re-write my initial, scathing review. Those re-writes open many windows into my own mind. The work is unpaid work, however, and I'm 100% "soft money." That is difficult to manage.<br>

      <p>There's also a dynamic where some of the abusive people are brilliant in their field; they are permitted a degree of leniency because of their undoubted expertise. This then results in other abusive people who aren't brilliant believing that they are being unfairly treated because they're not allowed the same degree of leniency as the brilliant experts. This dynamic can become cyclic, depending on how the abusive people are treated each time.

The point of having a laundry-list of things is to have things that're not on it. Notably, it's fine to exclude contributors for their choice of politics. There are others, but that's the main one that sticks out in its absence.<br>
<p>
Similarly the list of forbidden things is open-ended, meaning that regardless of how one tip-toes around these things the politruks-that-be can simply knit up a paddlin' out of rumour and equivalent derivatives[-1]. Likewise the specification of what amounts to representation is left open, so there's no way to tell what -- aside from wholly anonymous contributions, which the kernel is infamous for rejecting due to the SCO kerfuffle -- wouldn't fall afoul of (say) the rainbow-haired twatter mobs.<br>
<p>
There are other downright pernicious properties to this CoC. One of them is that it permits non-practitioners to participate in said twatter mobs at will, since penalties for e.g. harassment[0] apply only within the project. This is analoguous to the way non-practicing entities ("NPEs") are used to wage software patent wars by proxy: a NPE won't feel the burn from an auto-revocation clause in a general "public benefit" patent grant.<br>
<p>
Another is that it enshrines a method of adjudication where the accused may be denied chance to face their accuser, or to even hear the content of the accusation in detail so as to mount a reasoned defense. As such there's nothing that wouldn't allow Kafka-style kangaroo trials where the accused is put to the block on the basis of false claims by imaginary people based on made-up evidence. There's no reason the most egregious of falsehoods wouldn't fly: by structure alone, the accused will be found guilty even when the accusation would be physically impossible[1], because all the prosecutor need do is ask that the deets be kept secret from even the accused.<br>
<p>
Given the years-long history of this particular CoC and that of its authors, and particularly the way in which it's being applied[0] since its adoption in Linux, I hereby argue directly that these glaring flaws are in the CoC by design. In practice the document is a tool of power, of fascism presented as manners. Unless these failures are remedied forthwith, Linux as we knew it two weeks ago will become a sterile wasteland of poor technical choices[2] enshrined in the politics of ass-kissing, corporate power, and the accompanying cultural rot.[3]<br>
<p>
[-1] for example, the number of claims made by anonymous people, as in the case of the german Tor developer accused of pretty much grabbing all the buttocks wherever he went. Twenty nameless people making specious claims are as good as one that can be investigated, as long as the press shouts hard enough.<br>
[0] such as the tytso kerfuffle, which the usual suspects are warming up once again; spose they didn't like his vote against the CoC?<br>
[1] e.g. when a person would be required to be in two places at once, when the allegations are so poorly formed as to not be testable using any empirical experiment (no matter how involved or expensive) whatsoever, or the allegations require grand conspiracy of the sort that always manages to conceal itself. The latter kind in particular turns the absence of evidence into not just evidence but also an extra damning conspiracy membership!<br>
[2] that means you, kdbus.<br>
[3] which isn't to say that it already hadn't.<br>

Oh come off it. If anyone did that most of the kernel contributors would be massively pissed off, since whatever you choose a lot of other maintainers probably share that political stance.<br>
<p>
This is a code, not a program. You don't have to parse it like software. You don't even have to parse it like law: it's meant for the kernel developers to interpret, not for judges and certainly not for computers. (Also, it was adopted in a terrible hurry so worrying about its precise wording like this is simply ludicrous.)<br>
<p>
This also explains why penalties apply only within the project: it's not a law, it doesn't have the power to imprison you (or, indeed, any power at all except what the maintainers choose to grant it). Your claim that it has been applied since it was instituted is also ludicrous: it hasn't been applied to anyone at all yet, and random bloggers talking about it are just that: random bloggers talking about it.<br>

Something being a criminal offence doesn't mean it should be ignored for CoC purposes, but the point I was making was that it's inappropriate to describe someone who raped multiple people as being "accused of pretty much grabbing all the buttocks wherever he went".<br>

Due process, correctly, exists to provide a very high barrier against the state using its power against individuals. But if a conference attendee tells the organisers that a fellow attendee attempted to rape them, the organisers should take action even if the reporter is unwilling to contact the authorities. <br>

And if the alleged rapist has an otherwise clean sheet, while the alleged victim has a history of making complaints?<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are a fair few fantasists out there. And a lot of *MEN* are victims of sexual misbehaviour. Don't get me wrong, the majority of victims are female, and are often ignored, but those men who are victims seem to be ignored even more!<br>
<p>
(It seems pretty common for female predators - should a man dare reject them - to accuse their intended victim of all sorts of crimes. And seeing as we're on this subject, this seems to have been the crime of the "rape apologist" - to point out that men can just as easily be victims, too.)<br>

Action involves listening to the complaint, talking to those involved and making a decision based on the evidence. That decision may amount to no more than "Please stay away from this person", but the decision to engage should have nothing to do with whether someone's willing to go to the police.<br>

"No, but I'm unclear on what that has to do with anything."<br>
<p>
It's to do with "someone ... raped multiple people" and due process.<br>

That due process has its origins in the English Barons curbing King John's power is neither here nor there.<br>

It established the principal that <br>

“No freeman shall be ... in any way destroyed . . . except by the legal judgment of his peers or (and) by the law of the land.”<br>

I'm free to judge rapists in any way I want regardless of whether a court has found them guilty, just as you're free to judge me for doing so. As the OJ Simpson trial showed us, courts will (justifiably) refuse to use the power of the state against an individual if the state fails to prove its case in a reasonable way - but that doesn't demonstrate that he didn't murder his wife, and it's reasonable for individuals to treat him as if he did. Jake raped multiple people, and the absence of a legal ruling doesn't change that. If you think less of me for asserting that, well, feel free. <br>

That article is horribly biased and unfair, in particular considering that it's likely to be consumed by a much larger audience than that which is usually in contact with LKML. Torvalds is portrayed as an anti-social person doing little else than writing abusive email. <br>
<p>
This whole discussion is getting it wrong. Being on top of the maintainers chain, Torvalds could easily have dismissed stuff with words like "I don't like this patch, I'm not going to merge it - end of story." That would have fulfilled every criterion of "professionalism" that could be reasonably asked from a person in his position. Yet he often resorted to swearing instead, making himself vulnerable to those attacks which now prevail. Why? In part due to his temper, in part due to his lack of consideration... but other than abuse, can't these outcries be interpreted as - desperate and unhelpful - attempts to make the other side finally get his point?<br>
And if so, isn't that actually better than simply waving the other's arguments aside?<br>
<p>
Being sweared at by Linus is certainly a very unpleasant experience. But the way he is now being pilloried by a whole crowd of people is worse. Those who accuse him of being ignorant of other people's sentiments might perhaps consider _his_ feelings for a second. Jon mentioned Torvalds' harsh self-criticism. His willingness to discuss the weaknesses of his own personality in public is nothing but remarkable. I long to see half of that self-critical attitude from those who are attacking him.<br>

I doubt he'll remove it. It may get patched to become clearer in its intent. But that's like any other part of the kernel where we strive to make it better. I really believe Linus wants to change. I'm sure he may fall back to his old behavior every so often, but the difference is, when we tell him, "uh, Linus, that was a bit harsh", he'll react in a more positive way. I know personally that I have some of the same behaviors as he does. But I'm usually politer on email and text forums. In person, I can be very frank and honest and ignore social protocol. Luckily, I have an amazing wife that constantly corrects me. I want to do better, and she has confirmed that I have become better. But I still slip every so often. That's human. The point being, we can change, albeit slowly, if we really want to.<br>

There is no need to give special status to religious people compared to non-religious people, effectively discriminating atheists and humanists. While centuries of interpretation have ended up affirming, in most countries, that constitutional clauses for the freedom of religion equally protect the atheists, a document adopted in the 21st century should get such things right from the start.<br>
<p>
Even in USA the law now states "conscience, non-theistic views, or" before "religious belief or practice" and "The freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess or practice any religion."<br>

Well, if you subscribe to the notion that atheism is itself a religion that just "worships one less god than [the theists] do" as I've heard them claim, you should be fine...<br>
<p>
On the wider point, that list in the CoC is meant to be exemplary rather than exhaustive, maybe a few words to that effect would have been helpful. I know and respect several upright and sincere atheists, even though my beliefs happen to include spiritual truths and theirs don't.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Well, if you subscribe to the notion that atheism is itself a religion that just "worships one less god than [the theists] do" as I've heard them claim, you should be fine...</font><br>
<p>
Where did you hear that? In my experience the idea that atheism is a form of religion is typically advanced by non-atheists hoping to establish a false equivalency (that "atheism requires just as much faith as theism"). The quote that an atheist "just 'worships one less god than [the theists] do'" *is* attributable to atheists, but it's been taken out of context. (Paraphrasing: Theists are atheists with respect to every god humanity has ever worshipped save one; atheists just take this process one god further.)<br>
<p>
To coin another phrase: Atheism is a "religion" in exactly the same way that not collecting stamps is a "hobby".<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; On the wider point, that list in the CoC is meant to be exemplary rather than exhaustive, maybe a few words to that effect would have been helpful.</font><br>
<p>
I agree. Ironically, it would probably have helped if the list were *less* exhaustive—as it is, it seems like there are just a few categories which were omitted, which leaves people wondering if they were left out for a reason. If they had limited themselves to just a few marginal examples to define the scope, while omitting several more obvious ones, people would be less inclined to perceive the list as potentially exhaustive.<br>

<p>
It's not always used as a malicious false equivalency. In the United States, courts generally treat atheism as a religion, but they do so as a sort of legal fiction [1]. To these courts, atheism is only a "religion" in the sense that any laws regarding religion apply in equivalent ways to non-practice and non-belief. For example, the protected class (in terms of non-discrimination) that covers religion also applies to non-believers [2].<br>

<p>
That much I can agree with, but to me it implies only that laws about religious discrimination apply just as much to discriminating on the presence or absence of religion as they do to discrimination among different religions—not that atheism is itself a religion.<br>
<p>
I think the problem is that we are mixing up "religion" as a subject with "religions" as particular systems of faith and worship. Atheism is properly part of the subject of religion (as a negative position), but not *a* religion. Religious discrimination refers to the subject matter; you don't need to belong to any particular religion to be covered.<br>

I think you're confusing atheism and agnosticism.<br>
<p>
Atheists *believe* there is no god. As do *several* religions, I believe. But notice that I said atheists *believe*. In other words a religion.<br>
<p>
People who don't collect stamps *don't* *care*. Agnostics *don't* *care*. I wouldn't call agnosticism a religion - it's just an observation that "gods don't matter to me". It is also noticeable that Atheists typically attempt to convert other people to their beliefs - yet another defining characteristic of a religion. (Agnostics, again, *don't* *care* whether you agree with them or not.)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

      <p>Atheism and agnosticism both come in pragmatic and dogmatic variants.</p>
<p>The pragmatic atheist is merely adopting the null hypothesis (since no deities can be adequately shown to exist, proceed as if no deities exist) in the absence of sufficient evidence to believe in any particular deity; the dogmatic atheist actively believes there are no deities.</p>
<p>The pragmatic agnostic has no experience that they interpret as being experience of a deity or deities. The dogmatic agnostic believes that experience of deities (at least in life) is impossible. One can be agnostic (pragmatic or dogmatic) and still <em>believe</em> that deities exist, of course.</p>
<p>The dogmatic modes of each rather resemble religious doctrines, though I would hesitate to call them <em>religions</em> in the absence of additional premises attached thereto.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I think you're confusing atheism and agnosticism.</font><br>
<p>
No, what I am describing is atheism: the absence of belief in a god or gods.<br>
<p>
Agnosticism addresses a different question altogether: whether it is possible in principle to know whether or not god(s) exist. There are agnostic theists, and agnostic atheists, as well as theists and atheists who are not agnostic. Demanding evidence to justify belief, with absence of belief as the default in the absence of evidence, does not make one agnostic; it makes one a rationalist. The agnostic view is that there can be no evidence one way or the other, that belief and absence of belief are both equally "leaps of faith", and that all positions on the presence or absence of god(s) should be granted equal credibility.<br>
<p>
Atheists, as a rule, *don't* *care* whether you personally agree with them or not, as long as you keep to yourself and don't make trouble. However, unlike agnostics, non-agnostic atheists are unlikely to grant your beliefs equal credibility, and will tend to see any attempt to spread such beliefs in the absence of evidence as tantamount to fraud.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Atheists *believe* there is no god. But notice that I said atheists *believe*. In other words a religion.</font><br>
<p>
Some atheists assert that there is positive evidence for the absence of god(s). This is sometimes referred to as "strong atheism". Not all atheists hold this position. More to the point, even "strong atheism" is not a religion. A religion involves worship as well as belief. One can *believe* that the sky is blue, or that there are no invisible pink unicorns living in one's back yard, without making a religion out of it. None of the myriad varieties of atheism involve any form of worship; ergo, atheism is not a religion.<br>

I prefer "observance" to "worship", since IIRC Buddhism says that worshipping gods keeps you trapped in samsara (because you are worshipping a being who is themselves trapped in samsara).<br>

I think and feel this comes from intentions... And will fail.<br>
<p>
1.) "Laundry lists". -- The culture of today, in general and especially in tech, is all about skirting and avoiding the spirit while conforming to the letter.  Disruption is the core value, above all others.<br>
<p>
2.) As I've followed this and other intertwined issues, I've noticed things that might be explored but somehow aren't, and in not being explored I suspect some fundamental issues are being missed that apply in far more general ways:<br>
<p>
In an article published today in The Atlantic, this jumped out in the section on Megan Squire and is fascinating for this one comment:<br>
<p>
     Squire told me that she found few examples of gender bias. “He is an equal-opportunity <br>
     abuser,” she said. Squire added, though, that for non-male programmers the hostility and <br>
     public humiliation is more isolating.<br>
<p>
And that raises a question that so far I've never see raised, considered and obviously not answered.<br>
<p>
    Same abuse, but a radically more/different effect... Why?  <br>
<p>
The nearest answer I've seen is "it just is".  There is an additional question to be raised:<br>
<p>
    Is it really male vs non-male or was that the only divide tested?  If so, why?<br>
<p>
<p>
I think until these are addressed, there will be continuing issues and excessive conflicts.<br>

People from minority groups and from oppressed groups (and/or whatever intersectional combination you might come across) are generally dealing with additional challenges in their lives on top of what members of the dominant group are, and that means they have fewer resources left over to deal with the crap being hurled at them in the course of trying to contribute to the kernel. It's not gender that makes the difference, it's the position of relative power that men are typically in, particularly in the software industry,that insulates us from a lot of the negative effects of abusive behaviour. Not all of them, of course - everyone can suffer harm from abusive behaviour directed towards them, but if you're starting a lap behind already then you're a lot more vulnerable.<br>
<p>
The same is true for people from less common cultural backgrounds (in comparison to the existing community) - working in a second language, dealing with cross cultural communication issues, even things like the kind of humour that's considered acceptable in different cultures, all add to the background burden on people who are just trying to contribute.<br>
<p>
This is already well studied and understood, it's just not well accepted outside parts of academia, or what might be loosely termed the "social justice" movement. Lots of people don't seem to want to accept it - the push back that's going on now in this community is a perfect example. But it's either ignorant or disingenuous to claim that there's no explanation better than "it just is..." <br>

That's KIND of my point.  And the expression in the article was quite specific.<br>
<p>
Your response is along the lines of "...and every one knows this"<br>
<p>
My hackles always raise when I see this line of thinking/response.  <br>
<p>
But I DO absolutely agree that everyone can and does suffer harm from abusive behavior.  <br>
<p>
And that too is part of the issue here;  Harm is NOT gender, race or culture specific; Laying a claim to that specificity is a problem, in that explicitly excludes those other harms.  <br>

I don't think it's deliberate or intended, but it's there.<br>

      Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary was well-known for always saying "Es war sehr schoen, es hat mich sehr gefreut" (It was very beautiful, I enjoyed it) on cultural events.  Supposedly he adopted that phrase after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_van_der_N%C3%BCll">Eduard van der Nuell</a> (the architect of the (then) court opera in Vienna) had committed suicide after being criticized by the emperor (and others).  I am sure the emperor had phrased his critique in courteous words, but rejection hurts nonetheless.

<p>In contrast to the emperor on cultural issues, a project leader (whether Linus Torvalds or someone else) has to make decisions on project issues, and many decisions hurt people even when the words are code-conformant (for any code).  So I expect that a change in wording practices will have less effect on the addressees of the words than some may expect.  The difference will appear to be bigger to outsiders.

Yes, a good software project has to have someone to say no.   This applies even if the idea isn't bad - it just doesn't belong in that project, on that deadline, etc.  This seems to be very taxing and I can't stand doing it even on tiny internal shared repos for my company.  Software is extremely subjective, like the art in your example.<br>
<p>
A good book I've read is "Verbal Judo".  It's written by a police officer who trains other police and referees on how to tactfully talk to and get compliance from people who are behaving at their worst.   But those people will still go to jail.. just hopefully without adding additional offenses.  Ultimately, I liked the book because it shows how I'm not the only person who struggles with "tact".<br>

I'm a little puzzled by the list of "Signed-off-by" lines on the code-of-conduct commit.<br>
<p>
Signed-off-by is simply a statement affirming the "Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1", so it just says that all these people believe they either wrote the patch, or received it with an appropriate license, and in any case claim they have the right to include it in the kernel.  Surely we don't so many developers to certify the origin of this patch?<br>
<p>
It would have made much more sense to have multiple "Acked-by".<br>

In the debates here on LWN, and elsewhere on the internet, I've seen, what I understand to be, the following views expressed:<br>
<p>
A) The Linux developer community is healthy with occasional minor infractions.<br>
<p>
B) The Linux developer community is toxic.<br>
<p>
C) The Contributor Covenant is a generic document, which permits a wide range of interpretations.<br>
<p>
D) The Contributor Covenant is a tool meant for persuing social justice in the form of anti-meritocracy, and intersectional feminism.<br>
<p>
E) An online community can be welcoming, inclusive, and transparently police itself without adopting a Code of Conduct.<br>
<p>
F) A Code of Conduct is an important tool for ensuring a welcoming, and inclusive online community.<br>
<p>
I think there are real disagreements here, and I encourage these to be acknowledged, and addressed by the core maintainers. I do hope that "debate will continue until morale improves". Full disclosure: I find my views closest to the (A, D, E) triple.<br>

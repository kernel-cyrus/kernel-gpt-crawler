A great many devices in the embedded Linux world run vendor-supplied
kernels.  These kernels are not necessarily dangerous simply because
they contain code not found in the mainline kernel releases, but they
are still a cause for concern.  They introduce a maintenance burden at
the very least, as users (either end users or downstream commercial partners)
must work to apply out-of-tree patches 
when they migrate to newer kernel releases.  At worst, the
vendor's out-of-tree patches can include code that introduces security worries.
At the <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference">2016 Embedded Linux Conference</a> in San Diego, Hisao Munakata
<a href="http://openiotelc2016.sched.org/event/6K6r?iframe=no">presented</a> a recent effort he led to systematically measure and assess
the kernels that ship in vendor board support packages (BSPs).

<p>The full title of Munakata's talk was "Digitization of kernel
diversion from the upstream to minimize local code modifications."
As the latter half of that title suggests, Munakata believes that
measuring the number and riskiness of out-of-tree patches is only the
first step; SoC vendors and board manufacturers can and should seek to reduce their kernels'
divergence from mainline over time.  He works for the embedded Linux
device vendor Renesas and tested the measurement approach against the
company's own R-Car boards, which are designed for use in automotive
projects.  Most of the problems that embedded developers encounter
come from working with BSPs, he said, so assessing a BSP's  "health"
is a task all vendors would do well to consider.
</p>

</a>

<p>Unlike those working on desktop and server Linux projects, Munakata
said, embedded developers do not have a turnkey Linux distribution that
they can rely on to provide hardware support for the boards or
system-on-chips (SoCs) they use.  Instead, they almost always rely on
the board or SoC vendor's BSP and its included
kernel, which they combine in-house with other components.

<p>Vendors pick "random kernels" to ship, he said, while the board is in
development.  The <a href="/Articles/464834/">Long-Term Support Initiative</a> (LTSI) has helped
standardize such selections to a degree, but not entirely.
Because BSP kernels are generally developed by the vendor while the
product is also in development, the hardware is often revised several times
prior to release. Thus, the drivers and other patches are often written
and tested rapidly and may include patches that are little more than 
"quick and dirty hacks."  Those patches may work for the board in
question but break for other use cases, so they will never get
merged&mdash;assuming they are ever sent upstream.  

<p>For users, these BSP kernels cause two main problems: difficulty
when migrating to a new kernel releases and difficulty applying
security patches.  Migration to a new release is sometimes required,
even when it is arduous, to make use of a significant new feature or
API.  Vendor patches that touch the kernel outside of device drivers
make this process more complicated.  The security-patch issue is
similar, except that a security fix backported to an older kernel
release also adds a sense of urgency.

<p>Considering these issues, Munakata said, he decided it would be
useful to have a "sanity assessment" check for BSP kernels.  Ideally,
he said, a vendor kernel would include a human-readable "certification
of contents" file (in its board's bill of materials or BOM) that captured where the kernel differs from the
mainline kernel. The file would describe the purpose of each patch, the size and
location of each patch in the tree, and some sort of qualitative
measurement of each patch's riskiness.  He proposed a simple,
three-class system for categorizing riskiness: "clean" for patches
that merely enable support for new hardware features or backport a
relatively self-contained feature, "safe" for patches that
implement minor fixes, and "dirty" for patches that either rewrite
or outright break functionality from the mainline kernel.

<p>Considering the size of contemporary kernels, he said, such an
assessment has to be generated programmatically.  Initially, he
tried counting the matches and mismatches of SHA-256 file hashes,
using the <a href="http://kernel.operationaldynamics.com/yaminabe/project/">Yaminabe</a> tool.  That method provided insufficient detail,
however, because trivial and major changes both trigger a hash
mismatch.  He also tried tracing patches by Git commit IDs, which he said was
better at determining how many in-house patch sets have been applied
to a kernel, but still fell far short of the goal, since it does not
provide any way to measure the riskiness of a particular patch.
Naturally, that approach is also limited to those vendors that
manage their kernel patches in Git.

<p>The solution he finally settled on was combining Yaminabe's simple 
hash-mismatch hits with a second scan using a locality-sensitive hash,
a hash function that gives similar hashes for similar files and
progressively diverging hashes the more that the files compared
differ.  The <a href="https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh">Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash</a> (TLSH) is such a hash
available in
open-source form.  The result, built in collaboration with Armijn
Hemel, is <a href="http://elinux.org/Yaminabe2">Yaminabe2</a>.  It can compare two Git trees, first weeding out
identical files by comparing SHA-256 hashes.  For the mismatches, it
computes the TLSH hashes and reports a "distance" score for each
pair.  

<p>Transforming those distance scores into the "clean," "safe," and
"dirty" assessments desired took a bit of investigative work.  Running
Yaminabe2 against various revisions of the R-Car BSP, the distance
scores reported ranged from less than 10 (for trivial differences) up
to nearly 400.  After
several rounds of testing, he settled on some cut-off points.  A
distance score less than 60 can be marked as "clean;" a distance
between 60 and 150 can be marked as "safe," and any distance above 150
likely indicates that a patched file is "dirty."  Naturally, such
cut-off points can catch some false positives, and any such assessment
also needs to take a file's location in the kernel source tree into
account (e.g., whether it is a device driver or not).  But they serve
as a good starting point for further exploration.

<p>Munakata showed sample output from his R-Car BSP tests.  For the
sake of speed, Yaminabe2 uses a pre-computed database of SHA-256 and
TLSH hash scores for the comparison kernel (that is, the mainline) and
only processes the "target" Git tree for each run. 
The terminal version of the comparison tool reports the total number of mismatched files, then lists each file
and its distance score, followed by the total accumulated distance for
the entire tree.  For the R-Car second-generation board, based on the
3.10 LTSI kernel, the first BSP release tested (version 1.1.0) had a
total distance of 63,616, while the last (version 1.9.6) had a total
distance of 72,242.  That increase reflects the growing number of bug
fixes applied.  Over time, he said, he hopes to track such total
distance scores as aide to decreasing the R-Car BSP's divergence from
mainline.   

<p>The third-generation board, which was released in December 2015, is
currently working to keep pace with the current kernel, he said,
because the company 
wants to settle on the 2017 LTSI kernel for the board's long-term
support.  Interestingly enough, he added, the total distance reported
by Yaminabe2 is presently higher for the R-Car third generation, which
he finds perplexing.  But there are still many opportunities to tune
Yaminabe2: it could be taught to ignore files for irrelevant
architectures or features disabled by the BSP kernel configuration,
for example.  Perhaps one of those factors accounts for the unexpected
results for the new R-Car BSP. 

<p>The biggest improvement, he said, would be for other vendors to
test Yaminabe2 against their own BSPs, and for companies buying boards
or SoCs to run tests against the BSPs provided by their vendors.  This
would be particularly useful as a way to further refine the
risk-scoring system, which at present is quite simple.  Munakata added
that he also hopes to improve Yaminabe2's reporting features, and to
simplify the setup process.  At the moment, each Yaminabe2
installation requires a fair amount of customization to tune the TLSH
parameters to fit the hardware available (since TLSH is quite
CPU-intensive; a full scan can take 12 or more hours). 

<p>The code is currently available only as a tar archive on the
Yaminabe2 eLinux wiki page, while TLSH must be retrieved from that
project's GitHub page.  Yaminabe2 is a Python application, and the
bundle includes everything users will need to scan and compare any two
arbitrary Git trees.  But Munakata advised interested parties to start
with the (multi-gigabyte) pre-built SHA-256 and TLSH databases also
linked to from the wiki page, since scanning and hashing the mainline
kernel is a multi-hour operation even on a fast machine. 

<p>There are many ways one <em>could</em> gauge the riskiness of
vendor-supplied kernel.  Munakata and Hemel's work on Yaminabe2 offers
just one approach, and it certainly needs more widespread testing.  But it may prove to be a good start toward solving an under-addressed problem: helping embedded users get a handle on precisely where and how their BSP kernel diverges from the mainstream.

<p>
That's excellent for vendors who provide Git trees for their kernels. The modem/router manufacturers I've seen do not (but would a 2.6.24 tree have an infinite score?).<br>

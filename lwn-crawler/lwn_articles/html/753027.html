When kernel code needs to work directly with user-space pages, it often
calls <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/gup.c#L1067"><tt>get_user_pages()</tt></a>
(or one of several variants) to fault those pages into RAM and pin them
there.  This function is not entirely easy to use, though, and recent
changes have made it harder to use safely.  Jan Kara and Dan Williams led a
plenary session at the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit to discuss potential solutions, but it is not
entirely clear that any were found.
<p>
Kara started by saying that he just spent half a year chasing down reports of
kernel crashes; now that he has found the reason, he's not sure what to do
about it.  It comes down to how <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> is used.  When it
is called, it will translate user-space virtual addresses to physical
addresses and ensure that the pages are in memory.  Typically the caller
will then perform some sort of I/O on those pages.  There are a number of

<a href="/Articles/753034/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/JanKara-sm.jpg" alt="[Jan
Kara]" title="Jan Kara" class="rthumb"></a>

mechanisms by which this is done, but it all comes down to passing the addresses
of the pages to the devices.  When the I/O is complete, the kernel calls
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/page-writeback.c#L2531"><tt>set_page_dirty()</tt></a>
to mark the pages as dirty and releases its 
references to the pages.
<p>
Problems can arise when the kernel decides to perform writeback on some of
the pages brought in with <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  The writeback process
will write-protect the pages so that user-space cannot modify them until
writeback is complete, but it knows nothing about DMA operations started by
the driver that called <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>; that I/O may still be
ongoing.  One failure mode comes about as the result of the filesystem not
knowing that pages are changing underneath it; that can lead to crashes in
the filesystem code.
<p>
Other crashes can come about if page reclaim removes buffers from the pages
before the driver marks them dirty.  Problems can result from modification
of the data contained in pages while they are under writeback; it is
essentially the <a 
href="/Articles/442355/">stable pages problem</a> all over again.  And
there are various data loss or corruption problems associated with use of
<tt>fallocate()</tt> on pages that are under I/O — <tt>fallocate()</tt> may
want to shuffle pages around, but an ongoing DMA operation will do the
wrong thing if that happens.
<p>
Things get even worse if DAX is in use, since the pages in
question exist on the storage media itself.  If, for example, pages are
truncated from a file before DMA completes, the result can be data and
metadata corruption.  Running DMA directly against blocks that the
filesystem is manipulating is hazardous; the filesystem cannot see the
elevated reference counts that would indicate that something else is going
on with those pages.
<p>
Boaz Harrosh suggested simply preventing writeback on pages with elevated
reference counts, but that would be likely to create all kinds of strange
side effects.  The fact that subsystems like RDMA can hold references on

<a href="/Articles/753068/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/DanWilliams-sm.jpg" alt="[Dan Williams]"
title="Dan Williams" class="lthumb"></a>

pages for hours at a time exacerbates this kind of problem.  (The group
circled for a while on the topic of whether this kind of long-term
reference makes sense, without any sort of useful outcome).
<p>
Williams said that the core of the problem is finding a way to allow the
kernel to work with pages that have been pinned with
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  He proposed a set of changes, starting with
storing information about pinned pages in the inode (Al Viro was quick to
ask: "which inode?") and requiring <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> users to
provide a <tt>revoke()</tt> callback.  Jérôme Glisse insisted, though, that any call
site that could implement <tt>revoke()</tt> could also just use MMU
notifiers to detect changes.  Williams said that <tt>revoke()</tt> would
really just wait for the I/O to complete so that the pages could be
released, but Glisse pointed out that, with various types of I/O (such as a
camera device streaming video images) the I/O is never really done.  There
would be no avoiding taking action to stop I/O in such cases.
<p>
Going further, Glisse stated that MMU notifiers are the interface that the
kernel has now for dealing with memory-management events.  They are called
for all page-table entry changes, including write protection; they should be
used, he said, rather than reinventing the interface somewhere else.  Kara
acknowledged that the idea sounds interesting for short-term users of
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, at least.  As the session ran out of time,
Glisse said that long-term users could make it work too; the Mellanox RDMA
driver "did it right", for example.  Of course, he acknowledged, the fact
that this interface has its own memory-management unit helps.  The kernel
should, he said, "be mean" to hardware that lacks such capabilities.
<p>
About the only hard conclusion from this discussion was that more
discussions are needed before the developers will get a real handle on this
problem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

FWIW, a big problem with that approach is that get_user_pages_fast() is pretty much lost after that.  As it is, a good way to think of get_user_pages_fast() is to consider it a simulated TLB miss.  If we manage to resolve that out of page tables, everything's nice and fast (and lockless, at that).  If we run into something trickier, that simulated TLB miss escalates into a full-blown simulated page fault, which is where we start grabbing locks, hitting page cache, doing allocations, hitting disk, etc.  That's what "_fast" in get_user_pages_fast() is about and that's what we lose with that approach.  Even finding out which (if any) file is backing the area we are hitting requires pretty much the full-blown page fault locking.<br>
<p>
Doing that for the sake of infinibad playing silly buggers with long-term page references looks like a bad idea - the interface is used for a lot more than that and punishing the regular users that way is not an appealing prospect...<br>

<h1>Which filesystem for Samba4?</h1>

Andrew Tridgell has been hacking away on Samba 4 for a while now; that
project has gotten to the point that he has <a
href="/Articles/112567/">started doing some performance testing</a>.  His
first set of results looked like this (numbers in MB/sec):
<p>
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=2>
<tr><th>Filesystem</th><th>No xattr</th><th>With xattr</th></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td>ext2</td><td align="right">68</td><td align="right">64</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td>ext3</td><td align="right">67</td><td align="right">58</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td>xfs</td><td align="right">62</td><td align="right">40</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td>xfs 2K inode</td><td align="right">63</td><td align="right">58</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td>tmpfs</td><td align="right">69</td><td align="right">--</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td>jfs</td><td align="right">36</td><td align="right">29</td></tr>
<tr class="Odd"><td>reiser3</td><td align="right">58</td><td align="right">44</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

These results show that all filesystems slow down when extended attributes
are used.  This matters for Samba&nbsp;4 because Windows filesystems make
heavy use of extended attributes.  As Tridge put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The high cost of xattr support is a bit of a problem.... I hope we can
	reduce the cost of xattrs as otherwise Samba4 is going to be
	seriously disadvantaged when full windows compatibility is
	needed. I'm guessing that nearly all Samba installs will be using
	xattrs by this time next year, as we can't do basic security
	features like WinXP security zones without them, so making them
	perform well will be important.
</div>
<p>

The cause of the performance problems is not particularly mysterious.  Most
filesystems store extended attributes in a special data block, away from
the rest of the associated file's metadata.  So working with a file's
extended attributes forces the filesystem to go out and read another block
from the drive.  The extra transfers and seeks take their toll on
performance, as can be seen in the numbers above.
<p>

A pointer to the solution can be seen there as well.  The "xfs 2K inode"
results were obtained by turning on the XFS large inode option.  This
option expands the size of the on-disk inode structure, making room for the
extended attributes to be stored there.  When the inode is read from the
drive, the extended attributes come with it, and no separate I/O is
required to work with them.  When this option is enabled, the performance
hit for using extended attributes with XFS is much reduced.
<p>

It turns out that <a href="/Articles/112569/">a large inode patch for
ext3</a> has been in the works for a while; it has passed muster with the
ext3 developers, but has not yet been pushed into the mainline.  Tridge <a
href="/Articles/112571/">tried this patch</a> and was pleased with the
results:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Using a 256 byte inode on ext3 gained a factor of up to 7x in
	performance, and only lost a very small amount when xattrs were not
	used. It took ext3 from a very mediocre performance to being the
	clear winner among current Linux journaled filesystems for
	performance when xattrs are used. Eventually I think that larger
	inodes should become the default.
</div>
<p>

First, however, the patch must be merged.  With testimonials like this,
that merger is likely to happen in the relatively near future.
<p>

One interesting mystery remains, however: Tridge <a
href="/Articles/112572/">gets notably better results</a> with
2.6.10-rc2-mm2 than what he gets with 2.6.10-rc2.  As of this writing,
nobody seems to have an explanation for why ext3 should perform that much
better in the -mm kernel.  Inquiring minds very much want to know, however,
and Andrew Morton is working at finding out which patch makes the
difference.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The mystery has been solved.

You can call off your bsearch - I found the culprit.
<p>
For the 2.6.10-rc2 tests I was running with the patch from Andreas
that added large ext3 inode support (in order to also test the
ext3-256 case). For the -mm2 test I wasn't.
<p>
This patch was supposed to have no effect if large inodes were not
setup at mkfs time. Unfortunately it does have an affect as it also
removes the in-place xattr modification logic from
ext3_xattr_set_handle(), so every xattr set becomes the same as a
delete+create pair. In plain -rc2 and in -mm2 an xattr set of the same
size will be done in-place. As every xattr set is of the same size in
dbench3 this made a huge difference.

      The working set seems to have been too small to cause much disk activity which may explain the counterintutive result (ext3 being faster than jfs and xfs).  Most of the data I have seen on larger server benchmarks (whose working set exceeds physical memory) showed ext3 somewhat worse.  The updates to ext3 seem promising though.  <br>
<p>
In any case a good xattr performance test ala iozone or equivalent would be helpful as well.<br>

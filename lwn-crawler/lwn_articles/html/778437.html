           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 5, 2019</br>

The kernel's page cache, which holds copies of data stored in filesystems,
is crucial to the performance of the system as a whole.  But, as has
recently been 
demonstrated, it can also be exploited to learn about what other users
in the system are doing and extract information that should be kept
secret.  In January, the behavior of the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mincore.2.html"><tt>mincore()</tt></a>
system call was
changed in an attempt to close this vulnerability, but that solution was <a
href="/Articles/776801/">shown to break existing applications while not
fully solving the problem</a>.  A better solution will have to wait for the
5.1 development cycle, but the shape of the proposed changes has started to
come into focus.
<p>
The <tt>mincore()</tt> change for 5.0 caused this system call to report
only the pages that are mapped into the calling process's address space
rather than all pages currently resident in the page cache.  That change
does indeed take away the ability for an attacker to nondestructively test
whether specific pages are present in the cache (using <tt>mincore()</tt>
at least), but it also turned out to break some user-space applications
that legitimately needed to know about all of the resident pages.  The
kernel community is unwilling to accept such regressions unless there is
absolutely no other solution, so this change could not remain; it was thus
duly <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/30bac164aca750892b93eef350439a0562a68647">reverted</a>
for 5.0-rc4.
<p>
Regressions are against the community's policy, but so is allowing known
security 
holes to remain open.  A replacement for the <tt>mincore()</tt> change is
thus needed; it can probably be found in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190130124420.1834-1-vbabka@suse.cz/">this patch
set</a> posted by Vlastimil Babka at the end of January.  It applies a new
test to determine whether <tt>mincore()</tt> will report on the presence of
pages in the page cache; in particular, it will only provide that
information for memory regions that (1)&nbsp;are anonymous memory, or
(2)&nbsp;are backed by a file that the calling process would be allowed to
open for write access.  In the first case, anonymous mappings should not be
shared across security boundaries, so there should be no need to protect
information about page-cache residency.  For the second case, the ability
to write a given file would give an attacker the ability to create all
kinds of mischief, of which learning about which pages are cached is
relatively minor.
<p>
Interestingly, in the cases where <tt>mincore()</tt> does not return actual
page-cache residency information, it reports all pages as being
present.  This was done out of worries that applications might exist that
will make repeated attempts to fault in pages until <tt>mincore()</tt>
confirms that they are present in the cache; reporting a "present" state
will prevent such applications from looping forever.  But it might also
prevent them from bringing in the pages they need, harming
performance later.  In an attempt to avoid the second problem, Babka has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190130124420.1834-4-vbabka@suse.cz/">added another
patch</a> partially restoring the behavior that was removed from 5.0:
if information about page-cache residency for a given region is restricted
by the criteria described above,
pages will be marked as present only if they are mapped in the calling process's
page tables.  That will allow a process to observe the effect of explicitly
faulting a page in while hiding information about pages that the process
has not touched.
<p>
It appears that these changes should suffice to close off the use of
<tt>mincore()</tt> to watch the page-cache behavior of other processes
without breaking any legitimate use cases.  The real world is always
capable of providing surprises, though, so these changes will have to be
tested for a while before they can be trusted not to break anything.  For
this reason, they are unlikely to be merged for the 5.0 release.  They
<i>are</i> 
likely to be backported to the stable updates, though, if and when they get into
the mainline and nobody complains.
<p>
In the earlier discussions, though, Dave Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190108044336.GB27534@dastard/">pointed out</a>
that there are other ways of obtaining the same information.  In
particular, the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"><tt>preadv2()</tt></a>
system call, when used with the <tt>RWF_NOWAIT</tt> flag, will return
immediately (without performing I/O) if the requested data is not in the
page cache.  It, too, can thus be used to query the presence of pages in
the cache without changing that state â€” just the sort of tool an attacker
would like to have.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190130124420.1834-3-vbabka@suse.cz/">proposed
solution</a> here can also be found in the patch set from Babka; it works
by always initiating readahead on the pages read with <tt>RWF_NOWAIT</tt>.
That will bring the queried page(s) into the cache, turning the test into a
destructive one.  That does not entirely foil the ability to determine
whether a given page is in the cache, but it does eliminate the ability to
repeatedly query to observe <i>when</i> a target process faults a page into
the page cache.  That should block most of the attacks of interest.
<p>
In theory, this change does not affect the semantics of <tt>preadv2()</tt>
as seen by applications.  In practice, it could still prove problematic.
The existing <tt>preadv2()</tt> implementation takes pains to avoid
performing I/O or blocking for any reason; the changed version could well
block in the process of initiating readahead.  It is hard to tell whether
that change will create performance problems for specific applications, and
it may take a long time before any such problems are actually observed and
reported.  Nobody has suggested a better solution thus far, though.
<p>
Assuming that these patches find their way into the mainline, the known
mechanisms for nondestructively testing the state of the page cache will
have been closed off.  It will, of course, remain possible to do
destructive testing by 
simply measuring how long it takes to access a given page; if the access
happens quickly, the page is resident.  But destructive attacks are much
harder to block; they are also harder to exploit.  A much bigger problem is
likely to be nondestructive attacks that have not yet been discovered; like
Spectre, such problems have the potential to haunt us for some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

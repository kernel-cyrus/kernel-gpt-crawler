<h1>Realtime preemption and read-copy-update</h1>

Ingo Molnar's massive realtime preemption patch is an attempt to bring
near-realtime response to the stock Linux kernel.  It works by making almost
everything in the kernel preemptible.  Spinlocks turn into preemptible
mutexes; interrupt handlers get moved into preemptible kernel threads,
etc.  The result is a major change in how the scheduling of kernel code is
done and quick response to external events.
This work has been quieter in recent times, but it has not stalled by
any means.
<p>

When LWN last <a href="/Articles/107269/">looked at the realtime preemption
patch</a>, one of the remaining rough spots was its interaction with the
read-copy-update (RCU) mechanism.  RCU, remember, encapsulates a
conceptually simple (though a bit more gnarly in the implementation)
technique.  A resource of interest (a routing table entry, say) is
referenced by a pointer.  When that resource must be changed, a copy is
made and the changes are done there; the pointer is then directed at the
new copy.  At some future, safe time, the old version can be freed.  Linux
RCU works by requiring that all accesses to RCU-protected data structures
be atomic; with that constraint, a "safe time" can be defined as "after
every processor on the system has scheduled."  Since scheduling while
holding a reference to an RCU-protected structure is against the rules, any
such structure which was made inaccessible before all processors schedule
cannot be referenced by any processor afterward.
<p>

Since accesses to RCU-protected structures must be atomic, the RCU locking
function (<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt>) disables preemption.  But disabling
preemption is exactly what the realtime preemption patch is trying to get
away from, so something had to give.  Ingo had solved this problem by
requiring that all RCU users identify an explicit lock which protects the
structures in question, and modifying the RCU locking functions to take
that lock as a parameter.  This approach was never optimal.  It caused the
creation of a whole 
new family of new RCU functions to cope with every type of lock that might
be used, and, simultaneously, decreased the flexibility of the RCU read
locking mechanism.  And, to a great extent, it simply replaced RCU with
more traditional locking which, while it works, does not have the
scalability advantages which were the motivation for RCU in the first
place.
<p>

The RCU issue was clearly <a href="/Articles/129563/">on Ingo's mind</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If PREEMPT_RT is merged into the upstream kernel then it will (at
	least initially) be at a status similar to NOMMU: it will be
	tolerated as long as it causes no 'drag' on the main code. The RCU
	API variants i introduced clearly violated this requirement, and
	were my #1 worry wrt. upstream mergability.
</div>
<p>
So Ingo was pleased when RCU creator Paul McKenney <a
href="/Articles/128228/">proposed some approaches</a> for making RCU and
realtime preemption work together.  Paul's message goes through a series of
increasingly complex solutions, and is worth reading in its own right.  The
core idea, however, is that, in a fully preemptible world, RCU cannot
depend on atomic access to data structures, and thus cannot use the "all
processors have scheduled" heuristic to know that the time has come to
execute a given set of RCU cleanup functions.  So the tracking of code
executing within RCU critical sections must be made more explicit.  Paul's
solutions used a reader/writer lock for that purpose, but the approach
taken in Ingo's <a href="/Articles/129211/">latest realtime preemption
patch</a> is a little different.
<p>

The code executed to go into an RCU-protected section now looks like this
(when configured for realtime preemption):
<p>
<pre>
    void rcu_read_lock(void)
    {
	if (current-&gt;rcu_read_lock_nesting++ == 0) {
		current-&gt;rcu_data = &amp;get_cpu_var(rcu_data);
		atomic_inc(&amp;current-&gt;rcu_data-&gt;active_readers);
		smp_mb__after_atomic_inc();
		put_cpu_var(rcu_data);
	}
    }
</pre>
<p>
The idea is simple: a per-CPU count of processes in RCU critical sections
is kept.  When a process goes into a critical section, a pointer to the
current CPU's counter is stored with the task information, so
that the right counter will be decremented later on.  There is also a
per-process variable which keeps track of RCU section nesting.  No further
work needs to be done before the process can access the protected
structure; in particular, no locks are acquired.
<p>
When the process exits the critical section, the process is reversed: the
nesting count is decremented.  When that count goes to zero, the per-CPU
count is decremented as well.  If the per-CPU count drops to zero, then
that processor is deemed to have "quiesced," with no processes running
within RCU critical sections.  Once all CPUs have quiesced in this way (as
tracked by a bitmask of processors in the system), all RCU cleanup
functions queued before their respective processors quiesced can be
called.  
<p>

This scheme restores the core RCU functionality, allowing lock-free access
to fast-path data structures.  It also retains the current RCU API, with
the result that the realtime preemption patch becomes significantly less
intrusive.  It is not a perfect implementation, however.  It requires that
each CPU regularly find itself with no processes executing within RCU
critical sections.  Since these sections are now preemptible, the "quiet"
times could be quite far apart on heavily-loaded systems.  While the system
is waiting for a processor to quiesce, the RCU callback structures for the
cleanup functions will continue to accumulate, to the point that quite a
bit of memory could be used before the cleanup actually happens.  For the
realtime case, this tradeoff is acceptable: latency, not memory use, is the
most important factor.  Since the existing RCU algorithm is used when
realtime preemption is not configured in, everybody should be happy.  In
practice, further work may be required; in particular, it may be necessary
to find a way to force RCU cleanup when the system gets low on memory.
Meanwhile, however, the realtime
preemption patch appears to have gotten past one more major hurdle on its
way toward possible inclusion into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 20, 2017</br>
           </div>
There are a few reasons for wanting the ability to get proper stack traces
out of the kernel, including profiling, tracing, and debugging kernel
crashes.  Historically, the kernel's tracebacks have been unreliable for a
number of reasons, most of which have been fixed in recent years.  Now it
seems likely that the 4.14 kernel will include a new mechanism that
should put our traceback problems behind us — for now.
<p>
The state of the kernel's call stack can be surprisingly hard to
interpret.  Normally, it is made up of normal C function calls, but then
assembly-language code, interrupts, processor traps, etc. tend to confuse
the picture.  A confusing stack can, naturally, cause the "unwinder" code
that tries to derive the current call chain from that stack's contents to
do strange things; as a result, the kernel has long eschewed any sort of
complicated unwinding code.  For the most part, developers who deal with
kernel tracebacks have learned to cope with occasional bad data.
<p>
The live patching effort, though, depends on accurate call-stack
information for its consistency model; in short, it needs to be able to
tell which functions appear in the call stack of any thread in the system.
Getting there involved implementing the <a
href="/Articles/658333/">compile-time stack validation</a> mechanism to
ensure that all kernel code keeps the stack in reasonable condition at all
times.  The final step is a proper unwinder that uses this now-reliable
stack information.
<p>
Last May, an attempt to add such an unwinder based on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF</a> debugging records
emitted by the compiler <a href="/Articles/728347/">ran into trouble</a>
when Linus Torvalds saw it.  He noted that, the last time this
experiment was tried, the unwinder ran into continual problems from changes
to assembly-language code or problems with incorrect DWARF records and, as
a result,
proved to be unmaintainable.  Thus, he said: "<q>I do not ever again
want to see fancy unwinders with complex state machine handling used by the
oopsing code.</q>"  So DWARF, which requires that sort of complexity,
did not appear to be a good option.
<p>
That might have been the end of the story, given that Torvalds was firm in
his position, but Josh Poimboeuf <a href="/Articles/728346/">mentioned an
idea</a> he had been pondering for a bit.  The <tt>objtool</tt> utility
that performs stack validation at compile time builds a model of the state
of the stack at every point in the built kernel.  Perhaps, he thought, 
<tt>objtool</tt> could emit the 
debugging records to make that information available to the unwinder in a
format rather simpler than DWARF.  The result could be a more reliable
unwinder using a more efficient data format that, importantly, is fully
under the control of the kernel community and, one would hope, relatively
unlikely to break.
<p>
Two months or so later, the result is the <a href="/Articles/727553/">ORC
unwinder</a>.  The name ostensibly stands for "oops rewind capability",
though it's obviously a play on DWARF (which, in turn, is a play on the ELF
executable format).  The new ORC format is simple at its core; it is based
on this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct orc_entry {
	s16		sp_offset;
	s16		bp_offset;
	unsigned	sp_reg:4;
	unsigned	bp_reg:4;
	unsigned	type:2;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The purpose of an <tt>orc_entry</tt> structure is to tell the unwinder code
how to orient itself on the stack.  There is one of these structures
associated with each executable address in the kernel, along with a simple
data structure allowing the unwinder to find the correct entry given a
program-counter address.
<p>
The interpretation of the structure depends on the <tt>type</tt> field.  If
it is <tt>ORC_TYPE_CALL</tt>, the code is running within a normal C-style
call frame, and the beginning of that frame can be found by adding the
<tt>sp_offset</tt> value to the value found in the register indicated by
<tt>sp_reg</tt>.   If, instead, <tt>type</tt> is <tt>ORC_TYPE_REGS</tt>,
then that sum points to a <tt>pt_regs</tt>
structure describing the processor (and stack) state prior to a system call.  Finally,
<tt>ORC_TYPE_REGS_IRET</tt> says that <tt>sp_reg</tt> and
<tt>sp_offset</tt> can be used to find a return frame for a hardware
interrupt.  Those three possibilities appear to be enough to describe any
situation that will be encountered, at least on the x86 architecture.  (The
<tt>bp_reg</tt> and <tt>bp_offset</tt> fields don't appear to have much use
in the current implementation).
<p>
The resulting mechanism is far simpler than the DWARF mechanism.  Among
other things, that means it's quite a bit faster — a factor of at least 20x
is claimed.  Unwinding performance may not matter much when responding to a
kernel oops, but it's a big deal for function tracing and profiling.  The
ORC approach is also claimed to be more reliable than telling the compiler
to use frame pointers, and it doesn't suffer from the significant
performance hit that frame pointers bring with them.  And, as noted above,
the ORC format is entirely under the control of the kernel community, so it
shouldn't break with new compiler versions and, if it does, kernel
developers can fix it.
<p>
Of course, it's hard to predict just how creative the compiler developers
of the future may be when it comes to breaking call-stack information.
Poimboeuf acknowledges that risk in the patch posting, but notes that:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If newer versions of GCC come up with some optimizations which
	break objtool, we may need to revisit the current implementation.
	Some possible solutions would be asking GCC to make the
	optimizations more palatable, or having objtool use DWARF as an
	additional input, or creating a GCC plugin to assist objtool with
	its analysis.
</div>
<p>
The other disadvantage is that the ORC format takes more space than DWARF,
occupying 1MB or so of extra memory.  Poimboeuf <a
href="/Articles/728352/">suggested</a> that the memory use could be reduced
if it turns out to be a real problem.  "<q>However, it will probably
require sacrificing some combination of speed and simplicity</q>".
<p>
Torvalds has not yet made his feelings known regarding the ORC patches,
though he had in the past <a href="/Articles/728353/">indicated</a> that he
thought the combination of <tt>objtool</tt> and a simpler format might
work.  Ingo Molnar, meanwhile, has <a href="/Articles/728354/">applied the
patches to the tip tree</a>, indicating that they are likely to show up in
a 4.14 pull request.  So, barring last-minute problems, the multi-year
effort to get a reliable stack unwinder in the kernel may be close to
completion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      ORC will track neither of those things; it just provides the information needed to make sense of the kernel stack.  The kallsyms mechanism can associate symbols with addresses, as always.

A related question; will this eventually seep down into userspace, so that we can get reliable perf backtraces without frame pointers? (Yes, there's --call-graph=dwarf, but it requires dumping the entire stack to the perf trace, since DWARF is too slow to trace in realtime. So it makes for slow, huge traces.)<br>

There are a legion of readers who work exclusively on ARM processors.  I'm disappointed to read the entire article and then realize, looking at the source tree, that "at least on the x86 architecture" meant that the ORC format is not supported on any processors I work with.

      Lots of kernel features show up on x86 first; it doesn't usually take all that long for the interesting ones to spread to the other architectures.  I don't know of anybody working on ARMing the ORCs at the moment, but it would not surprise me if it happened fairly soon once the x86 stuff lands.

ARMing ORCs seems distinctly dangerous to me: they are not renowned for friendliness as neighbours. However, in this case the ARMs have already taken over the world so I'm not sure there's much the ORCs could do. :P<br>

ARM people feel neglected? I work exclusively on powerpc! :P<br>
<p>
From what I can tell of the initially-x86-only features that do get ported to other architectures, arm/arm64 gets them first, powerpc can be (an often distant) second, and everything else may well be never...<br>

Matt Fleming yesterday also posted a blog post about ORC unwinder, with some more details for some aspects of the topic: <a href="http://www.codeblueprint.co.uk/2017/07/31/the-orc-unwinder.html">http://www.codeblueprint.co.uk/2017/07/31/the-orc-unwinde...</a><br>

Is this x86 specific or can this be adapted to all arches ?<br>

Nice. Having done truly shameful things to get MIPS stack backtraces, I spent some time on an approach like this but changed jobs and it fell out of my universe. I have, apparently, a stack backtrace fetish and would take on the ARM version if I could just clone myself. Sigh.<br>

Now that this is merged ...<br>
<p>
What happens if we crash in eBPF JIT'ed code? Clearly there cannot be any ORC annotation for that? I'm not sure the JIT ever emits stack usage though.<br>

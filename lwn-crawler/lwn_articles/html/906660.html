Kernel code can, at times, be quite inward looking; it often refers to
itself.  To enable this introspection, the kernel has evolved several
mechanisms for identifying specific locations in the code and carrying out
actions related to those locations.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220830214919.53220-1-surenb@google.com/">code-tagging
framework</a> patch set, posted by Suren Baghdasaryan and Kent Overstreet,
is an attempt to replace various <i>ad hoc</i> implementations with a
single framework, and to add some new applications as well.
<p>
There are a number of reasons for the kernel to need to identify specific
locations within the code.  For example, kernel code is not normally
allowed to incur page faults, but the functions that access user-space
memory will often do just that.  To do the right thing in that situation,
the kernel build process makes a note of the location of every user-space access
operation; when a page fault happens, that list is checked and, if the
fault happened in an expected location, it is handled normally.  The
kernel's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.html">dynamic
debugging mechanism</a> is another example; each debugging print statement
is tracked and can be enabled independently.
<p>
The usual trick for implementing this kind of mechanism is to create a
special ELF section in the kernel binary; that section is then populated
with structures recording the points of interest within the kernel.  At run
time, the kernel can locate that section, where it will find an array of
structures with the needed information.  At its core, the tagging framework
is a set of functions and macros that make the creation of and access to
this special section easier.
<p>
A code tag denotes a location within the code itself; that location is
represented by a new structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct codetag {
	unsigned int flags;
	unsigned int lineno;
	const char *modname;
	const char *function;
	const char *filename;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure tracks a location but has no other information; it is meant
to be embedded within another structure specific to 
the tagging application.  For example, a large part of the patch set is
dedicated to the creation of a mechanism to track memory allocations; it
can record how much memory is allocated and freed at each call site, and
thus be used to track down memory leaks.  To do this, it will create a tag
at each allocation location with a structure like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct alloc_tag {
	struct codetag			ct;
	unsigned long			last_wrap;
	struct raw_lazy_percpu_counter	call_count;
	struct raw_lazy_percpu_counter	bytes_allocated;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>raw_lazy_percpu_counter</tt> is a new counter type that is also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220830214919.53220-4-surenb@google.com/">added</a>
by the patch set.  At this point we have a structure that can associate
these counters with the location stored in the <tt>codetag</tt> structure.
<p>
One of these structures is placed into the special <tt>alloc_tags</tt> ELF
section with a bit of macro magic:
<p>
<pre>
    #define DEFINE_ALLOC_TAG(_alloc_tag)				\
	static struct alloc_tag _alloc_tag __used __aligned(8)		\
	__section("alloc_tags") = { .ct = CODE_TAG_INIT }
</pre>
<p>
A bit more macro trickery is then used to replace the existing <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/mm-api.html#c.alloc_pages"><tt>alloc_pages()</tt></a>
function with a version that places the tag and remembers allocation calls:
<p>
<pre>
    #define alloc_tag_add(_ref, _bytes)					\
    do {								\
	DEFINE_ALLOC_TAG(_alloc_tag);					\
	if (_ref &amp;&amp; !WARN_ONCE(_ref-&gt;ct, "alloc_tag was not cleared"))	\
	    __alloc_tag_add(&amp;_alloc_tag, _ref, _bytes);			\
    } while (0)

    #define pgtag_alloc_pages(gfp, order)				\
    ({									\
	struct page *_page = _alloc_pages((gfp), (order));		\
									\
	if (_page)							\
	    alloc_tag_add(get_page_tag_ref(_page), PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; (order));\
	_page;								\
    })

    #define alloc_pages(gfp, order) pgtag_alloc_pages(gfp, order)
</pre>
<p>

The end result is that each call to <tt>alloc_pages()</tt> is
changed to create a static <tt>alloc_tag</tt> structure that records the
location of the call site; this structure is placed in
the <tt>alloc_tags</tt> section.  When an allocation call is made, the two
counters in that structure are incremented accordingly (in the not-shown
<tt>__alloc_tag_add()</tt> function).  Behind the scenes,
the code also makes a note (in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.5/source/include/linux/page_ext.h#L28"><tt>page_ext</tt>
structure</a> for the
allocated pages) of the tag location for the allocation call site; this
lets the kernel track which call site allocated each page.  When
the allocated pages are later freed, that information can be used to
decrement the counts for that call site.
<p>
What comes out of all this work is an array of <tt>alloc_pages()</tt> call
sites, each of which tracks the amount of memory that was allocated there
and which has not yet been freed.  The framework also includes
infrastructure for iterating through this array and for presenting its
contents in the debugfs filesystem.  It is not hard to see how this
information could be useful for a developer trying to track down a memory
leak.  Other patches in this series add similar tracking to the slab
allocator and the ability to store the call stack for each allocation,
giving more information on where the real source of a memory leak might be.
<p>
An entirely different application of this framework is dynamic fault
injection.  Driver code could, for example, include a sequence like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (dynamic_fault("foo-driver-init"))
        return -EIO;  /* Simulate a failure */
</pre>
<P>
The <tt>dynamic_fault()</tt> function, once again, places a code tag at the
call site.  It normally returns false, so the simulated failure code is not
run.  There is a knob that will appear under
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_faults</tt>, though, that can be used to
enable this fault site and test whether the driver's error handling works
correctly.
<p>
There is even more in the patch series, including a latency-tracking
mechanism and a reimplementation of the dynamic debugging facility.  The
point that is being made is that the code-tagging framework makes it
relatively easy to add this sort of feature to the kernel in a way that has
a minimal performance impact.
<p>
Most of the early discussion around this patch set has been inspired by <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yw8P8xZ4zqu121xL@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">Peter
Zijlstra's question</a> about just what this facility adds that is not
already provided by the kernel's tracepoint mechanism.  Overstreet <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220831155941.q5umplytbx6offku@moria.home.lan/">responded</a>,
somewhat defensively, that there are a number of advantages to the
code-tagging mechanism.  They include capturing all activity from boot
rather than just from when tracing was started, better performance, better
ease of use, and no problems with dropped events.  He said that the
question should be asked the other way around: tracing proponents should show how
that subsystem could be used to provide a similar capability with
comparable performance and ease of use.
<p>
In response, Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YxBZv1pZ6N2vwcP3@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">pointed
out</a> that use of ftrace is not necessary to attach to tracepoints;
attaching custom handlers to tracepoints would address concerns about
performance and dropped events.  Mel Gorman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220901110501.o5rq5yzltomirxiw@suse.de/">added</a>
that the tracepoint approach is more flexible, works with older kernels,
and is more widely available.  He also pointed to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220901044249.4624-1-osalvador@suse.de/">a patch
set from Oscar Salvador</a> implementing a different approach to
memory-leak detection.  Michal Hocko <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YxBc1xuGbB36f8zC@dhcp22.suse.cz/">worried</a> about
the difficulties of reviewing and maintaining a patch set of this size.
<p>
This is a new and large patch set; it is likely to be under discussion for
some time.  The code-tagging part itself seems like it should be a
relatively uncontroversial cleaning up of the code; it can, in theory,
replace a number of independent implementations in the kernel with a single
framework.  Each of the add-on changes is likely to require additional
discussion, though; one doesn't just walk into the memory-management
subsystem and change the core allocator code without having to answer some
questions.  Chances are that this patch set will end up being split into
its various components somewhere along the way so that each can be
considered on its own merits.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 25, 2022</br>
           </div>
A 64-bit pointer can address a lot of memory â€” far more than just about any
application could ever need.  As a result, there are bits within that pointer that
are not really needed to address memory, and which might be put to other
needs.  Storing a few bits of metadata within a pointer is a common enough
use case that multiple architectures are adding support for it at the
hardware level.  Intel is no exception; support for its "Linear Address
Masking" (LAM) feature has been slowly making its way toward the mainline
kernel.
<p>
CPUs can support this metadata  by simply masking off the relevant
bits before dereferencing a pointer.
Naturally, every CPU vendor has managed to support this feature differently.
Arm's <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/arm/tbi">top-byte ignore</a>
feature allows the most-significant byte of the address to be used for
non-pointing purposes; it has been supported by the Linux kernel since 5.4
came out in 2019.  AMD's "upper address ignore" feature, instead, only
allows the seven topmost bits to be used in this way; support for this
feature was <a href="/Articles/888914/">proposed earlier this year</a> but
has not yet been accepted.
<p>
One of the roadblocks in the AMD case is that this feature would allow the
creation of valid user-space pointers that have the most-significant bit
set.  In current kernels, only kernel-space addresses have that bit set,
and an unknown amount of low-level code depends on that distinction.  The
consequences of confusing user-space and kernel-space addresses could be
severe and contribute to the ongoing CVE-number shortage, so developers are
nervous about any feature that could cause such confusion to happen.  Quite
a bit of code would likely have to be audited to create any level of
confidence that allowing user-space addresses with that bit set would not
open up a whole set of security holes.
<p>
Intel's LAM feature offers two modes, both of which are different from
anybody else's:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>LAM_U57</tt> allows six bits of metadata in bits 62 to&nbsp;57.
<li> <tt>LAM_U48</tt> allows 15 bits of metadata in bits 62 to&nbsp;48.
</ul>
<p>
It's worth noting that neither of these modes allows bit 63 (the
most-significant bit) to be used for this purpose, so LAM avoids the
pitfall that has created trouble for AMD.
<p>
Support for LAM is added by <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220712231328.5294-1-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com/">this
patch set</a> from Kirill Shutemov.  Since LAM must be enabled in the CPU
by privileged code, the patch set introduces a new API in the form of two
new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/arch_prctl.2.html"><tt>arch_prctl()</tt></a>
commands that are designed to be able to support any CPU's pointer-metadata
mechanism.  The first, <tt>ARCH_ENABLE_TAGGED_ADDR</tt>, enables the use of
LAM for the current process; it takes an integer argument indicating how
many bits of data the process wishes to store in pointers and selects the
mode (from the above set) that holds at least that many.
<p>
Programs trying to use this feature need to know where they can store
their metadata within a pointer; this needs to happen in a general way if
such programs are to be portable across architectures.  The second
<tt>arch_prctl()</tt> operation, <tt>ARCH_GET_UNTAG_MASK</tt>, returns a
64-bit value with bits set to indicate the available space.  The patch set
also adds a line to each process's <tt>arch_status</tt> file in
<tt>/proc</tt> indicating the effective mask.
<p>
The LAM patches are, for the most part, uncontroversial; the LAM feature is
seen as being better designed than AMD's equivalent.  That said, there are
some ongoing concerns about the <tt>LAM_U48</tt> mode in particular that may prevent it
from being supported in Linux anytime soon.
<p>
Linux has supported <a href="/Articles/717293/">five-level page tables</a>
on x86 systems since the 4.11 release in 2017.  On a system with five-level
page tables enabled, 57&nbsp;bits of address space are available to running
processes.  The kernel will not normally map memory into the upper nine
bits of that address space, which is the part added by the fifth page-table
level, out of fear of breaking applications; among other things, some
programs may be storing metadata in those bits even without hardware
support.  More care must be taken when applying this trick since the
metadata bits must always be masked out before dereferencing a pointer, but
it is possible.  Programs that do this would obviously break, though, if
those bits became necessary to address memory within their address space.
<p>
To avoid this kind of problem, the kernel will only map memory into the
upper part of the address space if the application explicitly asks for it
in an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
call.  It's a rare application that will need to do that, and should be a
relatively easy thing to add in cases where it's necessary.
<p>
The <tt>LAM_U48</tt> mode, which uses 15 pointer bits and only leaves
48&nbsp;significant bits for the actual address, is clearly inconsistent with any
attempt to use a 57-bit address space.  One might argue that any programmer
who tries to use both together deserves the resulting explosions, but it is
better to simply not provide useless footguns whenever possible.  Since the
kernel already plays a role in the use of both modes, it is well placed to
ensure that they are not used together.
<p>
In Shutemov's patch set, the enabling of <tt>LAM_U48</tt> is relegated to a
set of optional patches at the end; if they are left out, the kernel will
only support the <tt>LAM_U57</tt> mode, which is certainly one way to solve
the problem.  If the patches are included, instead, then user space must
choose which of the two features it will use (if either); the mode that is
selected first wins.  If <tt>LAM_U48</tt> is enabled, the ability to
map memory in the upper nine bits of the address space will be permanently
removed from that process.  But if the process has already mapped memory
there when it tries to enable <tt>LAM_U48</tt>, the attempt will fail.
<p>
It seems like a reasonable solution that would make all of the
functionality available and let processes choose which they will actually
use, but developers remain concerned about the <tt>LAM_U48</tt> mode.
Alexander Potapenko <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG_fn=WR3s3UMh76+bibN0nUpZk9AS_M18=oxP+pc_vtqKt34A@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that distributors would want to remove this mode if it makes it into the
mainline, but that it would become harder to do so over time as other
changes land on top of it.  Dave Hansen, one of the x86 maintainers, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c5dc0415-8c2d-8c9c-5bdc-824c267aa960@intel.com/">said</a>
that he would not merge <tt>LAM_U48</tt> immediately, but would consider
doing so in the future.
<p>
So, while there does not seem to be much to impede the adoption of LAM in
general, it is not clear that <i>all</i> of the LAM patches will be merged
anytime soon.  If there are people with use cases for <tt>LAM_U48</tt> out
there, this might be a good time to make those use cases known; otherwise
they may find that the feature is unavailable to them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Well, a simple question, might sound useless to you, but still ..... are those LAM_U48 and LAM_U57 mutually exclusive?? That means whether the chosen option blocks others to assign in the same space, or does it cancel the precedence? <br>
<p>
IOW, if the devs assign U48 in a space, they are not allowed to assign U57. Kinda hard restriction.<br>
<p>
Reading the article and what I gather, which is not.  Not sure I am getting the right vibes. <br>

PS: If it does not make sense, it is my fault. <br>

That are technically mutually exclusive or, more accurately, setting LAM_U57 causes the hardware ignore the LAM_U48 bit. Thus setting both bits will cause the processor to adopt LAM_U57.<br>
<p>
LAM_U57 = 0 LAM_U48 = 0  -&gt;  No LAM<br>
LAM_U57 = 0 LAM_U48 = 1  -&gt; LAM_U48<br>
LAM_U57 = 1 LAM_U48 = 0  -&gt; LAM_U57<br>
LAM_U57 = 1 LAM_U48 = 0  -&gt; LAM_U57<br>
<p>
However that rather overlooks the fact that LAM_U48 is a super-set of LAM_U57 meaning any LAM_U57 compatible pointer tagging could be used in either of the LAM modes.<br>

LAM_U57 isn&#x27;t actually involved in the conflict at all. The conflict occurs when figuring out how to handle the existing 57-bit virtual addresses features alongside LAM_U48 (which only makes sense if you have 48-bit virtual addresses).<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m not sure a Kconfig option would help much; it looks to me like the existing approach (of letting each process choose which feature they want) is significantly better than a config option since choosing per-process allows 57-bit VA and LAM_U48 processes to exist on the same kernel.<br>

Tagged integers are fairly common in garbage collected languages.  OCaml sets the least significant bit when storing (63 bit) integers, and leaves it clear for pointers.  This has surprisingly small overhead when doing arithmetic because of various mathematical identities: <a href="https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/ocaml-internals/">https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/ocaml-internals/</a><br>
<p>
I&#x27;m not actually sure if OCaml could use the Intel scheme however since it works in the &quot;wrong&quot; way.<br>

We can't. The Intel PRM said "LAM doe not apply to addresses used for instruction fetches or to those that specify the targets of jump and call instructions."<br>

Sorry to bother you guys, but i just cannot think this through:<br>
<p>
since FS/GS could have a none-zero base, if a 64-bit pointer LinAddr = FS: EffAddr, how do we expect the masking behavior?<br>
in certain case, LinAddr[63] could be affected by arithmetic operation of the metadata, which seems weird to me.<br>
masking off the metadata before calculation is also improbableï¼Œsince we cannot know the masking bits before figuring out LinAddr[63] first.<br>
<p>
Does that means that when LAM enabled, or the segment base address must be zero? (in that case this feature should be just called as effective address masking)<br>
<p>
other segment(-related) base address like IDTR/LDTR/GDTR may also suffer the same issue.<br>

Bind mounts can be thought of as a sort of symbolic link at the filesystem
level.  Using <tt>mount&nbsp;--bind</tt>, it is possible to create a second
mount point for an existing filesystem, making that filesystem visible at a
different spot in the namespace.  Bind mounts are thus useful for creating
specific views of the filesystem namespace; one can, for example, create a
bind mount which makes a piece of a filesystem visible within an
environment which is otherwise closed off with <tt>chroot()</tt>.
<p>
There is one constraint to be found with bind mounts as implemented in
kernels through 2.6.25, though: they have the same mount options as the
primary mount.  So a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    mount --bind -o ro /vital_data /untrusted_container/vital_data
</pre>
<p>
will fail to make <tt>/vital_data</tt> read-only under
<tt>/untrusted_container</tt> if it was mounted writable initially.  On
your editor's 2.6.25 system, the failure is silent - the bind mount will be
made writable despite the read-only request and no error message will be
generated (the <tt>mount</tt> man page does document that options cannot be
changed). 
<p>

<!-- LWNPutAdHere -->

There is clear value in the ability to make bind mounts read-only, though.
Containers are one example: an administrator may wish to create a container
in which processes may be running as root.  It may be useful for that
container to have access to filesystems on the host, but the container
should not necessarily have write access to those filesystems.  As of
2.6.26, this sort of configuration will be possible, thanks to the merging
of the read-only bind mounts patches by Dave Hansen.
<p>

As it happens, it's <i>still</i> not possible to create a read-only bind
mount with the command shown above; the read-only attribute can only be
added with a remount operation afterward.  So the necessary sequence is
something like:
<p>
<pre>
    mount --bind /vital_data /untrusted_container/vital_data
    mount -o remount,ro /untrusted_container/vital_data
</pre>
<p>
This example raises an interesting question: what if some process opens a
file for write access between the two <tt>mount</tt> operations?  A system
administrator has the right to expect that a read-only mount will, in fact,
only be used for read operations.  The 2.6.26 patch is designed to live up
to that expectation, though the amount of work required turned out to be
more than the developers might have expected.
<p>
Filesystems normally track which files are opened for write access, so an
attempt to remount a filesystem read-only can be passed to the low-level
filesystem code for approval.  But the low-level filesystem knows nothing
about bind mounts, which are implemented entirely within the virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer.  So making read-only access for bind mounts work
requires that the VFS keep track of all files which have been opened for
write access.  Or, more precisely, the VFS really only needs to keep track
of <i>how many</i> files are open for write access.
<p>
The technique chosen was to create something which looks like a write lock
for filesystems.  Whenever the VFS is about to do something which involves
writing, it must first call:
<p>
<pre>
    int mnt_want_write(struct vfsmount *mnt);
</pre>
<p>
The return value is zero if write access is possible, or a negative error
code otherwise.  This call can be found in obvious places - such as in the
implementation of <tt>open()</tt> - when write access is requested.  But
write access comes into play many other situations as well; for example,
renaming a file requires write access for the duration of the operation.
So <tt>mnt_want_write()</tt> calls have been sprinkled throughout the VFS
code. 
<p>
When write access is no longer needed, the "write lock" should be released
with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void mnt_drop_write(struct vfsmount *mnt);
</pre>
<p>
One of the discoveries which has been made is that write access is needed
in rather more places than one might have thought.  In particular, it turns
out that there is need for <tt>mnt_want_write()</tt> calls within the
low-level filesystems as well as in the VFS layer. So getting the
read-only bind mounts patch into shape has been an ongoing process of
finding the spots which have been missed and adding
<tt>mnt_want_write()</tt> calls there.  In an attempt to make this process
a bit less error-prone, Miklos Szeredi has put together <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/280992/">a set of VFS helper functions</a>
which encapsulate the situations where write access is needed.  Those
functions have not been merged for 2.6.26, however.
<p>
Superficially, <tt>mnt_want_write()</tt> is easy to understand - it simply
increments a counter of outstanding write accesses.  The problem with a
simple implementation, though, is that a shared, per-filesystem counter
would create scalability problems.  On multiprocessor systems, the cache
line containing the counter would bounce around the system, slowing things
considerably.
<p>
A common response to this type of problem is to turn the counter into a per-CPU
variable, allowing operations on the counter to remain local to each
processor.  When somebody needs to know the total value of the counters,
it's a simple matter of adding each CPU's version; this operation is slow,
but it is also rare.  On big systems, though, the number of CPUs can be
large - as can the number of filesystems, and bind mounts will only
increase that number.  The result is a multiplicative effect which, once
again, is a scalability problem, only this time it manifests itself in the
form of excessive memory use.
<p>
The read-only bind mounts patch resolves this situation by, in effect,
going back to global counters which are cached on specific processors.  To
that end, each CPU has one of these structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct mnt_writer {
	spinlock_t lock;
	unsigned long count;
	struct vfsmount *mnt;
    }
</pre>
<p>
At any given time, this structure will hold a local count for one
filesystem, represented by <tt>mnt</tt>.  If the processor needs to adjust
the write count for that filesystem, it's a simple matter of incrementing
or decrementing <tt>count</tt>.  When the processor's attention turns to a
different filesystem, it must first adjust the global count for the old
filesystem, then it can switch its local <tt>mnt_writer</tt> structure to
the new one.  The result is a compromise between purely local and purely
global counters which yields "good enough" performance on benchmarks
designed to stress the system.
<p>

Read-only bind mounts join with other features (such as <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/159077/">shared subtrees</a>) to create a
flexible set of tools for the construction of the filesystem namespace.  It
is not clear how much of this functionality is being used at this time,
but, as the implementation of containers in the mainline gets closer to
completion, there is likely to be more interest in this capability.  Linux
systems in coming years may have much more complex filesystem layouts than
have been seen in the past.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It is also usefull in backup sitution, when you want users to have access to backup data, but
readonly. Because backuping data needs write access to partition which holds backup, and
probably you want to save space using hardlinking you must have both read-write access for
root, and read only for users because backuped data have orginal permissions which can state
that user have read-write access to them (this is bad because, if files are hardlinked beetwen
snapshots file modifications can destroy previous snapshots! and stupid users can also destroy
own backups, which is also bad :D ).

Very usefull feature.

      I hope he gets around implementing proper union mounts soon, at least there has been some progress on the user space front and we have a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sqweek.dnsdojo.org/code/9mount/">9mount</a> command that is more or less safe for non-root users to use. <br> <br>

<a rel="nofollow" href="http//plan9.us">Plan 9 from User Space</a> has also made quite a bit of progress and is quite usable (one can even use venti to have automatic snapshot backups on almost any *nix system, which is quite a bit better than Apple's TimeMachine).
<br> <br>
And now there is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://swtch.com/9vx/">9vx</a> which makes running Plan 9 kernels on top of linux a breeze...

As other commenters posted, the given method for producing a read-only bind mount will actually remount all the underlying filesystems (e.g., bind mounting /home/test1/asdf to /mnt, then making /mnt read-only will remount /home to be read-only).<br>
<p>
To do this and *only* remount the bind mount as read-only:<br>
<p>
mount -o bind /home/test/asdf /mnt<br>
mount -o bind,remount,ro /mnt<br>
<p>

           <p>This article was contributed by Jani Nikula</p>
           </div>
The kernel's documentation tree is going through a fundamental transition
toward the use of <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> and <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>
for the production of
formatted documents.  The <a href="/Articles/692704/">first article in this
series</a> discussed the path the development community took as it made the
decision to go with Sphinx.  This article, which concludes the series,
covers the mechanics of the new documentation system and how to add to it.

<p>From the casual developer's perspective, building the documentation
hasn't changed much. In the 4.8 kernel and beyond, the usual
"<tt>make&nbsp;htmldocs</tt>" and 
"<tt>make&nbsp;pdfdocs</tt>" commands will invoke both Sphinx to build the
documentation written in reStructuredText and the old toolchain to build
documentation still in DocBook format. One will need to have Sphinx
installed, obviously. For prettier HTML, the Read the Docs Sphinx theme
(<tt>sphinx_rtd_theme</tt>) will be used if available. For PDF output, the
<a href="http://rst2pdf.ralsina.me/stories/index.html">rst2pdf</a> package
is also needed. All of them are readily available in stable
distributions.</p>

<p>The documentation build for Sphinx uses a dedicated
<tt>Documentation/Makefile.sphinx</tt>, with <tt>Documentation/conf.py</tt> for
configuration. The generated files are placed under
<tt>Documentation/output</tt> in format-specific subdirectories. Currently,
there is not much documentation that is actually built from
reStructuredText, but the graphics documentation as well as
documentation about the Sphinx-based system itself will be ready in time
for v4.8. Over time, the plan is that all DocBook documents will be
converted to reStructuredText, and we can finally say goodbye to
DocBook.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the build system, Sphinx is pleasantly simple
compared to the DocBook toolchain. It handles dependencies within documents
by itself,
storing intermediate data in the output directory. This allows
the build system to work without knowledge of how the input and output files
map to each other.</p>
<p>
<h4>Writing documentation</h4>

<p>Adding new documentation to the Sphinx build can be as simple as
following these steps:</p>
<ol class="spacylist">
<li>Add a new reStructuredText file somewhere under <tt>Documentation</tt> with
a <tt>.rst</tt> extension.</li>
<li>Refer to it from the main index file <tt>Documentation/index.rst</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For now, converting existing plain-text and DocBook files to reStructuredText is more
likely to happen than adding new files altogether. Because the current
plain-text files don't follow any markup, they need to be manually
converted; happily, by design, plain text is not too far from lightweight
markup. We expect that some of the thousands of plain-text files will be
converted to reStructuredText over time, but there is no real pressure to do so, and not
everything needs to be part of the documentation build. </p>

<p>
The DocBook conversion is more interesting.
There's a &quot;cheesy conversion script&quot; from Jonathan Corbet in
<tt>Documentation/sphinx/tmplcvt</tt> that uses <tt>pandoc</tt> with some
<tt>sed</tt> pre- and post-processing. Markus Heiser has been working on
some more advanced conversion scripts. The DocBook templates should be
converted primarily by their authors or maintainers to ensure they remain
sensible and no errors creep in while converting. The conversion is a
one-time effort anyway, so after a point, polishing the scripts is wasted
effort. (<a href="http://kernel.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-samples/">Here's a
sample</a> of the 
results of some of the DocBook files converted using the cheesy script,
with no manual editing on top.)</p>

<p>Once converted, the DocBook templates are to be placed alongside other
documentation under <tt>Documentation</tt>
instead of in a silo under <tt>Documentation/DocBook</tt>. That directory,
along with the entire DocBook toolchain, is slated to be removed once all
the documents therein have been converted. Even developers who couldn't
care less about producing pretty documents can benefit from converting the
DocBook templates to reStructuredText because grepping and reading
reStructuredText is much easier than the angle-bracketed mess that is
DocBook.</p>

<p>Eventually we'll need to have more structure than just shoving
everything directly in the main index. In particular, the PDF output needs
to be split into several documents. This can be done using a configuration
option in <tt>Documentation/conf.py</tt> as more documents are added. For
starters, however, keeping things simple seems like the way to go.</p>
<p>
<h4>Formatted kernel-doc comments</h4>

<p>When building documentation using Sphinx, the kernel-doc comments are
now treated as reStructuredText. Some hiccups will inevitably follow, as
the comments were not written with reStructuredText in mind, but mostly it just
works.</p>

<p>The <tt>kernel-doc</tt> script parses the formatted comments at the high
level (function and structure names, parameter and member descriptions, and
so on), generates appropriate Sphinx <a
href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html">C Domain</a>
anchors for them, filters the comments for highlights and cross-references,
and otherwise passes the rest through as-is. The filters convert
<tt>function_name()</tt> and references to structure types (using the 
<tt>&amp;struct struct_name</tt> convention) to proper C Domain
cross-references, and there are other 
highlights as well.</p>

<p>A dedicated Sphinx directive extension incorporates kernel-doc comments
from source files into the document. Internally, the extension invokes
<tt>kernel-doc</tt> to do the job and informs Sphinx about the document
dependencies on source files. The extension makes it possible to include
kernel-doc comments with any reStructuredText file under
<tt>Documentation</tt> with no special handling or dependency tracking in
the makefiles.</p>

<p>For example, to include the documentation for all the functions exported
using <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> from <tt>bitmap.c</tt>, you'd write the
following:</p>

<pre>
    .. kernel-doc:: lib/bitmap.c
       :export:
</pre>

<p>To include <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_audio.c#n33">an
overview documentation section from <tt>intel_audio.c</tt></a>:</p> 
<pre>
    .. kernel-doc:: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_audio.c
       :doc: High Definition Audio over HDMI and Display Port
</pre>

<p>The <tt>DOC:</tt> title given in the source code acts as an identifier
for the section. There are also ways to include documentation for specific
functions or types.</p>

<p>Daniel Vetter's contributions enable the kernel-doc extension to feed
the source code file and line number of each documentation comment to
Sphinx to enhance diagnostic messages on reStructuredText errors. This
will come in handy when fixing the hiccups mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>
<h4>Future work</h4>

<p>There has been some talk (and even <a href="/Articles/692710/">code</a>
from Markus) to convert 
the <tt>kernel-doc</tt> script from Perl to Python and perhaps to run it
directly in the Sphinx
extension. It is not clear, however, whether it's worth converting a
homebrew C parser with two decades of field testing from one language to
another just for the sake of it. Perhaps a compiler plugin would be a
better idea.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, the media documentation in particular needs better
syntax for tables. To this end, Markus has written <a
href="/Articles/692711/">a Sphinx extension to 
support row and column spans</a>, among other things, in tables. This work,
too, looks set to go into 4.8; it is a dependency for converting the media
documents.</p> 

<p>But, on a positive note, most of the work discussed in this article has
been merged. We'll be seeing more documentation patches that convert files
to reStructuredText, as well as fixing and improving kernel-doc comments in
source. Hopefully the changes will improve the state of the kernel
documentation as a whole, and will move us one step closer to the
documentation maintainer's vision as expressed during <a
href="https://youtu.be/gsJXf6oSbAE?t=37m">a linux.conf.au talk</a>,
&quot;If we do this, we end up with, some years from now, this 
beautiful, integrated documentation tree, that covers things in a
comprehensive way, where you can find what you want, looks pretty when you
look at it. It's a nice vision, I hear angels singing when I think about it
and so on, it's where I want to go.&quot;</p>

Jani mentioned that I worked on some more advanced conversion scripts. Now I<br>
separated this work in a project. To install the project visit:<br>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://return42.github.io/dbxml2rst/">https://return42.github.io/dbxml2rst/</a><br>

I'am also continuous working on my POC, testing all my developments and thoughts.<br>

There you will find a conversion of all DocBooks and a full scan of the kernel<br>
source tree. The scan gather all kernel-doc comments and builds a analogous tree<br>
of reST files with the documentation from the source-code comments. The HTML<br>
of this is here:<br>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://return42.github.io/sphkerneldoc/linux_src_doc/index.html">http://return42.github.io/sphkerneldoc/linux_src_doc/inde...</a><br>
<p>
All this is based on a set of Sphinx-extensions from my POC, available from my<br>
*linuxdoc* project:<br>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://return42.github.io/linuxdoc">https://return42.github.io/linuxdoc</a><br>
<p>
Within the *linuxdoc* project, you will find the python version of the<br>
kernel-doc parser (Jani mentioned), which runs directly in the Sphinx<br>
process. For me, the decision to reimplementing the kernel-doc perl script in<br>
python was not easy. But within my POC I came to the point where I thought, that<br>
adapting the perl script was at its end. E.g. scanning a file only one time not<br>
on every kernel-doc directive and implementing stuff like a kernel-doc lint is<br>
more straight forward with the python version.<br>

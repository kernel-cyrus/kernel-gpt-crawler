<p>
One of the more useful outcomes from the Snowden revelations may well be the
increased scrutiny of the security of our systems.  While no one would
(sensibly) claim that all of the problems have been found and fixed, there
has been improvement in many different areas over the last year or
so.  One of the areas that has received some attention recently has been the
kernel's random number generation.  Two recent patches continue that trend,
though it is hard to claim that they are the direct result of the exposure
of NSA (and other secret agency) spying.
</p>

<p>
Both patches update the state of the "entropy pool" that is used to
generate random numbers for both <tt>/dev/random</tt> and
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.  That pool is associated with a (conservative)
estimate of the amount of entropy (i.e. state unknowable by an attacker)
stored within it.  Anything that is believed to truly add entropy gets
credited in that estimate, while other, possibly even attacker-controlled,
input is simply mixed into the pool without entropy credit.  The entropy
estimate is used to block <tt>/dev/random</tt> readers when the amount of
data requested is larger than the amount of entropy in the pool.
</p>

<h4>Adding <tt>RDSEED</tt></h4>

<p>
The first patch is from H. Peter Anvin and it simply <a
href="/Articles/589402/">adds support for the <tt>RDSEED</tt> instruction</a> to the
kernel.  <tt>RDSEED</tt> is an instruction being added to Intel processors
that returns "<q>fully
conditioned entropy that is suitable for use as seeds to a PRNG
[pseudo-random number generator]</q>".  The patches use four bytes of
<tt>RDSEED</tt> output 
to mix into the entropy pool at boot time (with
no entropy credit).  In addition, four bytes are generated using the
instruction once per second and then mixed into the pool.
It is also used to do an "emergency refill" with 64 bytes of <tt>RDSEED</tt> output
if <tt>/dev/random</tt> is 
about to block due to a lack of entropy credit to fulfill a
request.  In both of the latter cases, four bits of credit are given for
each byte of <tt>RDSEED</tt> output that gets mixed into the pool.
</p>

<p>
Some may not be convinced that a black-box hardware random number generator
(RNG) 
buried inside an Intel chip should be given that much (or any) entropy
credit.  It is a difficult question, as there is no <i>technical</i>
barrier to the instruction returning known-to-the-NSA sequences and there
is no way for anyone (at least anyone outside of Intel) to know for sure.
While that may seem paranoid, many formerly paranoid scenarios have moved
into the "plausible" category over the last year.  That concern has not
been raised about the <tt>RDSEED</tt> patches, however.
</p>

<h4>Mixing and unmixing</h4>

<p>
The other patch, from Kees Cook, would <a href="/Articles/590398/">add some
output</a> from a newly instantiated hardware RNG into the entropy pool.
When the RNG is 
registered (via <tt>hwrng_register()</tt>), sixteen bytes of its output
would get mixed into the pool, but without any entropy credit.  Jason
Cooper was <a href="/Articles/590417/">concerned</a> that even mixing these
bytes into the pool could lead to problems: "<q>By adding this patch, even without crediting entropy to the pool, a
rogue hwrng now has significantly more influence over the initial state
of the entropy pools.</q>"
</p>

<p>
But Cook didn't see it as any different than mixing in other random or
system-specific data at initialization time:
<div class="BigQuote">
Sure, and I don't want to be the one weakening the entropy pool.
However, I think this patch is no different from the ones that stuff a
NIC MAC into the pool -- it's taking something from my system that is
unique or random and pushing the entropy seed around. It seems silly
that if I've loaded the hwrng-tpm module, my system entropy pool isn't
bumped.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In addition, former random subsystem maintainer Matt Mackall <a href="/Articles/590420/">brought up</a> an
important aspect of the design of the mixing function.  Because it can be
reversed, mixing even attacker-controlled data into the pool can never
remove randomness that was there at the outset:
<div class="BigQuote">
The pool mixing function is intentionally _reversible_. This is a
crucial security property.
<p>
That means, if I have an initial secret pool state X, and hostile
attacker controlled data Y, then we can do:
<p>
X' = mix(X, Y)
<P>
 and 
<p>
X = unmix(X', Y)
<p>
We can see from this that the combination of (X' and Y) still contain
the information that was originally in X. Since it's clearly not in Y..
it must all remain in X'.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That didn't entirely mollify Cooper, who was still concerned that built-in
hardware RNGs would have their output mixed in early in the boot sequence.
He was worried that those bytes could pollute the pool, but Mackall
<a href="/Articles/590422/">reiterated</a> his argument, putting it in
starker terms:
<div class="BigQuote">
If the pool is in an attacker-knowable state at early boot, adding
attacker-controlled data does not make the situation any worse. In fact,
if the attacker has less-than-perfect control of the inputs, mixing more
things in will make things exponentially harder for the attacker.
<p>
Put another way: mixing can't ever [remove] unknownness from the pool, it
can only add more. So the only reason you should ever choose not to mix
something into the pool is performance.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While the mixing function design with reversibility in mind (and its
implications) was clear in Mackall's mind, it would seem that others in the
kernel community did not know about it.  It's an interesting property that
makes perfect sense, once you know about it, but is rather
counter-intuitive otherwise.  In any case, Cooper's objections were
withdrawn, and hardware RNG maintainer Herbert Xu <a
href="/Articles/590423/">queued the patch</a>.  We should see it in 3.15.

I wonder if people assuming that the random mixing was not reversible might cause security problems. I can't think of any off-hand, but many security problems come from faulty assumptions on someone's part of how something else is done. <br>

That's assuming the pool state X is secret.  If the HWRNG can snoop on things, like the CPU's RDRAND instruction can, then it can easily choose Y based on X, in which case the "it's clearly not in Y" assertion doesn't apply.

Assuming they have some way of getting that information out of the compromised system, sure.  From the link I mentioned: "Of course, the malicious device will also be able to see other sensitive information, not just x and y. But this doesn't mean that it's cheap for the attacker to exfiltrate this information! The attacker needs to find a communication channel out of the spying device. Randomness generation influenced by the device is a particularly attractive choice of channel, as I'll explain below".<br>

These sorts of debates over security properties in lieu of a security proof, especially when the possibility of not being able to trust the actors involved is present, makes me deeply dubious.<br>

I'm no expert in the field, but it seems to me that even if a reversible process has a useful security property, it may not be necessary to use that reversible process to get the property.<br>

To me it seems more like people aren't aware of the security proofs that exist. The reversibility means it's impossible to make an RDRAND that will steer the pool to a particular state without knowing what the state is.<br>
<p>
And if your threat model includes the possibility that the RDRAND can actually peek into the state of the pool it is being mixed into, well, then you're screwed anyway.<br>

The entropy estimate is also used to block /dev/random *writers* (i.e. things adding entropy) if the pool is believed to contain lots (i.e. there is a high watermark as well as a low). This is beneficial to keep things that acquire entropy from expensive-to-read sources like USB devices from trying to acquire it on idle systems that don't need any more entropy.<br>

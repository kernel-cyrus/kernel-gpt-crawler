<h1>A netlink-based user-space crypto API</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>October 20, 2010</br>

<p>
User-space access to the kernel cryptography subsystem has reared its head
several times of late.  We <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/401548/">looked
at one proposal</a> back in August that had a <tt>/dev/crypto</tt>
interface patterned after 
similar 
functionality in OpenBSD.  There is another related effort, known as the <a
href="http://home.gna.org/cryptodev-linux/ncr.html">NCR API</a>, and
crypto API maintainer Herbert Xu has recently <a
href="/Articles/410833/">posted an RFC</a> 
for yet another.  But giving user space the ability to request that the kernel
perform its computation-intensive crypto operations is not uncontroversial. 
</p>

<p>
As noted back in August, some kernel hackers are skeptical that there would
be any performance gains by moving user-space crypto into the kernel.  But
there are a number of systems, especially embedded systems, with dedicated
cryptographic hardware.  Allowing user space to access that hardware will
likely result in performance gains, in fact 50-100x performance improvements
have been reported.
</p>

<p>
Another problem with both the <tt>/dev/crypto</tt> and NCR APIs
(collectively known as the cryptodev-linux modules) is the
addition of an enormous amount of code to the kernel to support
crypto algorithms beyond those that are already available.  Those two
modules have adapted user-space
libraries for crypto and multi-precision integers and included them into
the kernel.  They are necessary to support 
some government crypto standards and certifications that require a
separation between user 
space and crypto processing.  So, the cryptodev-linux modules are trying to
solve two separate (or potentially separate) problems: user-space access to
crypto hardware acceleration and security standards compliance.

<p>
When Xu first <a href="/Articles/410848/">put out an RFC</a> on his idea
for the API (without any accompanying code) back in September, Christoph
Hellwig had a rather <a href="/Articles/410850/">strongly worded
reaction</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
doing crypto in kernel for userspace consumers [is] simply insane.
It's computational intensive code which has no business in kernel space
unless absolutely required (e.g. for kernel consumers).  In addition
to that adding the context switch overhead and address space transitions
is god [awful] too.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Xu more or less agrees with Hellwig, but sees his API as a way to provide
access to the hardware crypto devices.  Because Xu's API is based on
netlink sockets (as opposed to <tt>ioctl()</tt>-based or a brand new API that the
cryptodev-linux modules introduce), he is clearly <a
href="/Articles/410854/">hoping</a> that it will provide a 
way forward without requiring such large changes to the kernel:
<div class="BigQuote">
FWIW I don't care about user-space using kernel software crypto at
all.  It's the security people that do.
<p>
The purpose of the user-space API is to export the hardware crypto
devices to user-space.  This means PCI devices mostly, as things
like aesni-intel [Intel AES instructions] can already be used without
kernel help. 
<p>
Now as a side-effect if this means that we can shut the security
people up about adding another interface then all the better.  But
I will certainly not go out of the way to add more crap to the
kernel for that purpose.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The netlink-based interface uses a new <tt>AF_ALG</tt> address family that gets passed to the initial
<tt>socket()</tt> call.  There is also a new <tt>struct sockaddr_alg</tt>
that contains 
information about what type of algorithm (e.g. "hash" or "skcipher") is to
be used as well as the specific algorithm name (e.g. "sha1" or "cbc(aes)")
that is being requested.  That structure is then passed in the
<tt>bind()</tt> call on
the socket.
</p>

<p>
For things like hashing, where there is little or no additional information
needed, an <tt>accept()</tt> is done on the socket, which yields an
operation file descriptor.  The data to be hashed is written to that descriptor
and, when there is no more data to be hashed, the appropriate number of
bytes (20 for sha1) are then read from the descriptor.  
</p>

<p>
It is a bit more
complicated for ciphers.
Before accepting the connection on the socket, a key needs to be
established for a symmetric key cipher.  That is done with a
<tt>setsockopt()</tt> call using the new <tt>SOL_ALG</tt> level and
<tt>ALG_SET_KEY</tt> option name and passing the key data and its
length. But there are additional parameters that need to be set up for
ciphers, and those are done using <tt>sendmsg()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
A cipher will need to know which direction it is operating in
(i.e. encrypting or decrypting) and may need an initialization vector.
Those are 
specified with the <tt>ALG_SET_OP</tt> and <tt>ALG_SET_IV</tt> messages.
Once the <tt>accept()</tt> has been done, those messages are sent to the
operational descriptor and the cipher is ready for use.  Data can be sent as
messages or written to the operational descriptor, and the resulting data can then
be read from that descriptor.
</p>

<p>
There is an additional wrinkle for the "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEAD_block_cipher_modes_of_operation">authenticated
encryption with associated data</a>" (AEAD) block cipher mode, which can
include authentication information (i.e. message authentication code or
MAC) into the ciphertext stream.  Because of that, AEAD requires two data
streams, one containing the data itself and another with the associated
authentication data (the MAC).  This is handled in Xu's API by
doing two <tt>accept()</tt> calls, the first for the operational descriptor, and
the second for the associated data.  If the cipher is operating in
encryption mode, both descriptors will be written to, while the encrypted data is
read from the operational descriptor.  For decryption, the ciphertext is written to
the operational descriptor, while the plaintext and authentication data are read
from the two descriptors.
</p>

<p>
There hasn't been much discussion, yet, of the actual code posting, but
Xu's September posting elicited a number of complaints about performance,
most from proponents of the cryptodev-linux modules.  But it would seem
that there is some real resistance to adding completely new APIs (as NCR does)
or to adding a complicated <tt>ioctl()</tt>-based API (as <tt>/dev/crypto</tt>
does).  Now there are three competing solutions available, but it isn't at
all clear that <i>any</i> interface to the kernel crypto subsystem will be
acceptable to the kernel community at large. We will have to wait to see
how it all plays out.

I must say I'm not a big fan of sockets or netlink. You cannot access them with shell scripts...<br>
<p>
I much prefer the filesystem model.<br>
<p>
{ cat myfile &amp;&gt;0 ; read hash ; } &lt;&gt; /random-mountpoint/crypto/hash/sha1<br>
<p>
So the name of the algorithm in passed as part of the file name, the content is written to the file descriptor.  The hash is read from that same filedescriptor.  The hash state is stored attached to the 'struct file'.  See "Transaction based IO" in fs/libfs.c.  It would need to be extended to work with writing a large file, but the concept is sound.<br>
<p>
For encrypting.. using the same 'fd' for both read and write is problematic in a way that it isn't (so much) for the above.  The original (Unix 6) pipe syscall returned only one fd which you could read from and write to.  One problem with that was that it can be awkward to detect when the 'write' end has been closed (so the read end should get EOF), as there is no distinction between the two.  If you happen to have two processes with the 'read' end open you never see EOF.<br>
<p>
If we can either ignore that or work around it, then<br>
 /mountpoint/crypto/cypher/$direction/$cyphertype/$key/$iv<br>
is a promising file name to write to/ read from, except that there is a risk that the key would get stuck in the dcache and appear in /proc/$N/fd/$FD.  I'm sure that is solvable though.  The key would be HEX or BASE64 encoded of course. <br>
<p>
The need to multiplex cyphertext and MAC is certainly a complication.  I suspect there was a reason Herbert suggested 2 sockets rather than a simple multiplexing scheme. Without knowing that reason it is pointless trying to refine the design.<br>
<p>
If it was to be done with sockets, it would seem to make much more sense to use 'socketpair(AF_ALG, SOCK_STREAM, ....)' rather than the sockets + accept model.  Then you have distinct 'read' and 'write' ends.  I would also use MSG_OOB to send the MAC beside the cyphertext rather than having two separate streams (not that I am a big fan of MSG_OOB, but it does seem to be a shoe that fits).<br>

I have to confess that I do not understand what problem the open() ioctl() interface have that the socket() setsockopt() bind() accept() solves.<br>

To me it looks like you just transform magic ioctl number into magic socket options and magic sendmsg() commands. <br>

where is the benefit over /dev/crypto ?? <br>

The advantage that the sockets API has over ioctl is that the former provides a single, standard, already implemented and tested method of marshalling and unmarshalling parameters kernel-side.<br>
<p>
The fundamental problem of the ioctl interface is that every implementer of the interface must re-implement that parameter marshalling - for every arch.  There are plenty of ioctl()s that *still* don't work properly for IA32 callers on x86-64 arch.<br>

While I'm sure socat is an absolutely awesome program, I'm guessing it isn't precognitive, and so cannot support new address families and socket options until someone goes to the trouble of coding them in.<br>

Netlink is the wrong way to do anything.  It is a kernel interface designed in the image of a network.  However the kernel is not a network node.  The kernel supports a nice simple and generic model of file methods, from which any desired stream interface to the kernel may be derived in a straightforward efficient way that does not bring along the addressing baggage of netlink.  Please just don't spam the kernel with new uses of netlink.  Ever.<br>

      Well, speaking as the architect of a hardware cryptography device&hellip;
<p>
I also dislike for Xu's proposal.  Sorry.
<p>
My issues with this API (unlike the previous commenters) relate to function, not form:
<p>
<ol>
<li>It creates unnatural semantic linkages between sockets (most importantly these pairs of sockets used for AEAD, which need to be written to/read from in a very particular ordering)
<li>There is no way to achieve zero-copy cipher operation with this API (at least one of the sendmsg()/recv() will have to copy data to/from an skbuff).
</ol>
I don't really have a good alternative API; crypto just doesn't appear to map cleanly to the Unix abstractions.  <em>Maybe</em> a specialized system call ("sendrecvmsg()"/"servercall()" or somesuch) could help with the second point.

When you say "zero-copy", do you need the transformation to happen in-place, or is it OK to transform (e.g. encrypt) from one buffer to another buffer as long as the app chooses the buffers?<br>
<p>
I'm imagining you do an aio_read() to identify the buffer for the transformed data to be written to, then an O_DIRECT write to identify the buffer containing data to be transformed.  The underlying implementation would need to notice the presence of a pending aio_read and place the result directly there rather than in the page cache.<br>
<p>
I guess the same thing could do an in-place transformation, but it could get messy.<br>
<p>
Of course if O_DIRECT wasn't used it would fall back to the simple case of copying to the page cache, transforming, and copying back out.<br>

      I refer to "zero-copy" in rather loose terms&mdash;not copying more than is necessary.  In particular, if the application chooses input/output buffers that are suitable for DMA, I would like to perform a single DMA translation (many cryptography engines have dual-channel DMA engines, so they can read the source buffer via DMA, transform it, and write the output to the target buffer in a single pass).
<p>
As for the specific API&mdash;all proposals I have seen so far look like hacks, and are rather brittle (e.g. the aio_read solution would require the driver to keep userspace pointers for longer than a single system call, which is generally considered bad taste AFAIK).

One man's hack is another man's elegant design :-)<br>

aio, by its very nature, requires the kernel to hold on to user-space pointers for longer than a single system call.  This is OK because 'aio_cancel' exists to reclaim the pointer if needed.<br>

4) I am new to ioctl-based programming, so can anyone please tell me what is<br>
awful about it?<br>
<p>
The biggest problem with ioctl is by FAR that people get it wrong.  ioctl is the equivalent of typing everything in C void * and wondering why your program isn't behaving correctly.  Look at ioctl vs getsockopt() and setsockopt()<br>
<p>
int ioctl(int d, int request, ...);<br>
<p>
int getsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, void *optval, socklen_t *optlen);<br>
int setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);<br>
<p>
They provide the same ability to be generic and to move data back and forth but the socket functions encode size and direction into the call.  It means you can easily do sane checks in the kernel.<br>
<p>
Linus has recently pushed a bit that syscalls are the right way to go (not in this discussion, just in general discussions about kernel/userspace ABI).  A good syscall is going to provide size, direction, and strong typing of arguments.<br>
<p>
The more information an interface encodes and enforces the more likely it is that the interface will be used correctly.<br>

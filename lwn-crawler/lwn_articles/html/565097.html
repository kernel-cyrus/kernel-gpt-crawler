           </div>
As a general rule, kernel developers prefer data structures that are
designed for readability and maintainability.  When one understands the
data structures used by a piece of code, an understanding of the code
itself is usually not far away.  So it might come as a surprise that one of
the kernel's most heavily-used data structures is also among its least
comprehensible.  That data structure is <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, which
represents a page of physical memory.  A recent patch set making
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> even more complicated provides an excuse for a
quick overview of how this structure is used.
<p>
On most Linux systems, a page of physical memory contains 4096 bytes; that
means that a typical system contains millions of pages.  Management of
those pages requires the maintenance of a <tt>page</tt> structure for each
of those physical pages.  That puts a lot of pressure on the size of
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>; expanding it by a single byte will cause the
kernel's memory use to grow by (possibly many) megabytes.  That creates a
situation where almost any trick is justified if it can avoid making
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> bigger.
<p>
Enter Joonsoo Kim, who has posted <a href="/Articles/564381/">a patch
set</a> aimed at squeezing more information into <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>
without making it any bigger.
In particular, he is concerned about the space occupied by
<tt>struct&nbsp;slab</tt>, which is used by the slab memory allocator (one
of three allocators that can be configured into the kernel, the others
being called SLUB and SLOB).  A slab can
be thought of as one or more contiguous pages containing an array of
structures, each of which can be allocated separately; for example, the
<tt>kmalloc-64</tt> slab holds 64-byte chunks used to satisfy
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> calls requesting between 32 and 64 bytes of space.  The
associated <tt>slab</tt> structures are also used in great quantity;
<tt>/proc/slabinfo</tt> on your editor's system shows over 28,000 active
slabs for the ext4 inode 
cache alone.  A reduction in that space use would be welcome; Joonsoo
thinks this can be done â€” by folding the contents of
<tt>struct&nbsp;slab</tt> into the <tt>page</tt> structure representing the
memory containing the slab itself.
<p>
<h4>What's in struct page</h4>
<p>
Joonsoo's patch is perhaps best understood by stepping through <tt>struct
page</tt> and noting the changes that are made to accommodate the extra
data.  The full definition of this structure can be found in
<tt>&lt;linux/mm_types.h&gt;</tt> for the curious.  The first field appears
simple enough:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long flags;
</pre>
<p>
This field holds flags describing the state of the page: dirty, locked,
under writeback, etc.  In truth, though, this field is not as simple as it
seems; even the question of whether the kernel is running out of room for
page flags is hard to answer.  See <a href="/Articles/335768/">this
article</a> for some details on how the flags field is used.
<p>
Following <tt>flags</tt> is:
<p>
<pre>
    struct address_space *mapping;
</pre>
<p>
For pages that are in the page cache (a large portion of the pages on most
systems), <tt>mapping</tt> points to the information needed to access the
file that backs up the page.  If, however, the page
is an anonymous page (user-space memory backed by swap), then
<tt>mapping</tt> will point to an <tt>anon_vma</tt> structure, allowing the
kernel to quickly find the page tables that refer to this page; see <a
href="/Articles/75198/">this article</a> for a diagram and details.  To
avoid confusion between the two types of page, anonymous pages will have
the least-significant bit set in <tt>mapping</tt>; since the pointer itself
is always aligned to at least a word boundary, that bit would otherwise be
clear.
<p>
This is the first place where Joonsoo's patch makes a change.  The
<tt>mapping</tt> field is not currently used for kernel-space memory, so he
is able to use it as a pointer to the 
first free object in the slab, eliminating the need to keep it in
<tt>struct&nbsp;slab</tt>.
<p>
Next is where things start to get complicated:
<p>
<pre>
    struct {
	union {
	    pgoff_t index;
	    void *freelist;
	    bool pfmemalloc;
	};

	union {
	    unsigned long counters;
	    struct {
		union {
		    atomic_t _mapcount;
		    struct { /* SLUB */
			unsigned inuse:16;
			unsigned objects:15;
			unsigned frozen:1;
		    };
		    int units;
	        };
	    	atomic_t _count;
	    };
	};
    };
</pre>
<p>

(Note that this piece has been somewhat simplified through the removal of
some <tt>#ifdef</tt>s and a fair number of comments).  In the first union,
<tt>index</tt> is used with page-cache pages to hold the offset into the
associated file.  If, instead,  the page is managed by the SLUB or SLOB
allocators, 
<tt>freelist</tt> points to a list of free objects.  The slab allocator
does not use <tt>freelist</tt>, but Joonsoo's patch makes slab use it the
same way the other allocators do.  The <tt>pfmemalloc</tt> member, instead,
acts like a page flag; it is set on a free page if memory is tight and the
page should only be used as part of an effort to free more pages.
<p>
In the second union, both <tt>counters</tt> and the innermost anonymous
<tt>struct</tt> are used by the SLUB allocator, while <tt>units</tt> is
used by the SLOB allocator.  The <tt>_mapcount</tt> and <tt>_count</tt>
fields are both usage counts for the page; <tt>_mapcount</tt> is the number
of page-table entries pointing to the page, while <tt>_count</tt> is a
general reference count.  There are a number of subtleties around the use
of these fields, though, especially <tt>_mapcount</tt>, which helps with
the management of compound pages as well.  Here, Joonsoo adds another field
to the second union:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int active;	/* SLAB */
</pre>
<p>
It is the count of active objects, again taken from <tt>struct slab</tt>.
<p>
Next we have:
<p>
<pre>
    union {
	struct list_head lru;
	struct {
	    struct page *next;
	    int pages;
	    int pobjects;
	};
	struct list_head list;
	struct slab *slab_page; 
    };
</pre>
<p>
For anonymous and page-cache pages, <tt>lru</tt> holds the page's position
in one of the least-frequently-used lists.  The anonymous structure is used
by SLUB, while <tt>list</tt> is used by SLOB.  The slab allocator uses
<tt>slab_page</tt> to refer back to the containing <tt>slab</tt>
structure.  Joonsoo's patch complicates things here in an interesting way:
he overlays an <tt>rcu_head</tt> structure over <tt>lru</tt> to manage the
freeing of the associated slab using read-copy-update.  Arguably that
structure should be added to the containing union, but the current code
just uses <tt>lru</tt> and casts instead.  This trick will also involve
moving <tt>slab_page</tt> to somewhere else in the structure, but the
current patch set does not contain that change.
<p>
The next piece is:
<p>
<pre>
    union {
	unsigned long private;
#if USE_SPLIT_PTLOCKS
	spinlock_t ptl;
#endif
	struct kmem_cache *slab_cache;
	struct page *first_page;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>private</tt> field essentially belongs to whatever kernel subsystem
has allocated the page; it sees a number of uses throughout the kernel.
Filesystems, in particular, make heavy use of it.  The <tt>ptl</tt> field
is used if the page is used by the kernel to hold page tables; it allows
the page table lock to be split into multiple locks if the number of CPUs
justifies it.  In most configurations, a system containing four or more
processors will split the locks in this way.  <tt>slab_cache</tt> is used
as a back pointer by slab and SLUB, while <tt>first_page</tt> is used
within compound pages to point to the first page in the set.
<p>
After this union, one finds:
<p>
<pre>
    #if defined(WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL)
	void *virtual;
    #endif /* WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL */
</pre>
<p>
This field, if it exists at all, contains the kernel virtual address for
the page.  It is not useful in many situations because that address is
easily calculated when it is needed.  For systems where high memory is in
use (generally 32-bit systems with 1GB or more of memory), <tt>virtual</tt>
holds the address of high-memory pages that have been temporarily mapped
into the kernel with <tt>kmap()</tt>.  Following <tt>private</tt> are a
couple of optional fields used when various debugging options are turned
on.
<p>
With the changes described above, Joonsoo's patch moves much of the
information previously kept in <tt>struct&nbsp;slab</tt> into the
<tt>page</tt> structure.  The remaining fields are eliminated in other
ways, leaving <tt>struct&nbsp;slab</tt> with nothing to hold and, thus, no
further reason to exist.  These structures are not huge, but, given that
there can be tens of thousands of them (or more) in a running system, the
memory savings from their elimination can be significant.  Concentrating
activity on <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> may also have beneficial cache
effects, improving performance overall.  So the patches may well be
worthwhile, even at the cost of complicating an already complex situation. 

<p>
And the situation is indeed complex: <tt>struct page</tt> is a complicated
structure with a number 
of subtle rules regarding its use.  The saving grace, perhaps, is that it
is so heavily used that any kind of misunderstanding about the rules will
lead quickly to serious problems.  Still, trying to put more information
into this structure is not a task for the faint of heart.  Whether Joonsoo
will succeed remains to be seen, but he clearly is not the first to eye
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> as a place to stash some useful memory management
information.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

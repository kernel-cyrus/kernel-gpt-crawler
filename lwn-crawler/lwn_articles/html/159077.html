<h1>Shared subtrees</h1>

The shared subtrees patch set, written primarily by Ram Pai, has been in
circulation for some time, but without a whole lot of discussion.  Those
patches have now been merged into the pre-2.6.15 mainline, so the time has
come for a closer look.
In short, shared subtrees allow a system administrator to configure, in
great detail, how various filesystem mounts should appear in the tree, how
they relate to each other, and how they propagate between namespaces.
There are two motivations for this work:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The "files as directories" feature of the reiser4 filesystem allows 
     a user to create, via hard links, a directory which appears in
     multiple places in the filesystem.  That feature has long been
     disabled due to the deadlock issues which it raised.  Shared subtrees
     are a step toward implementing "files as directories" in a safe
     manner.
<p>
<li> The merging of the filesystems in user space patch, and some of the
     <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/131856/">permissions issues</a>
     associated with it, has increased the desire to be 
     able to run users in their own filesystem namespaces.  Per-user
     namespaces are currently awkward at best; shared subtrees will help 
     make them easier to manage.
</ul>

<p>
It should be noted that the patches merged into the mainline are not a
complete solution for either of the above problems, but they are a step in
that direction.  The per-user namespaces example will be used in what
follows to illustrate how the various subtree options work.
<p>

Every filesystem in Linux is mounted within a specific namespace.  The
kernel has long supported the creation of multiple namespaces, but, in most
situations, that feature is not used.  So the typical Linux system has a
single namespace which is shared between all processes on the system.
When separate namespaces are used, they are usually in the context of
sandboxing and isolation.  There would be advantages, however, to making
more extensive use of namespaces.
<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees1.png" width=172 height=110
align="right" alt="[simple tree]" border=0 hspace=2>
Imagine, for starters, a simple filesystem hierarchy which looks something
like the diagram at the right.  Clearly, a few directories have been left
out for simplicity.  The only unusual thing is that a couple of directories
have been created under <tt>/subtree</tt> for users "alice" and "bob".  We
would like to use those directories as the root for each user's own private
view of the filesystem.
<p>

The first step is to create a copy of the root filesystem under each user's
subtree directory using bind mounts.  The result of such an operation will
look like the diagram below.  
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees2.png" width=491 height=189
alt="[diagram]" hspace=2 border=0>
</center>
Note that the
<tt>/subtree</tt> tree has been bound into each user's namespace as well.
This propagation cuts down on the isolation between users, since they can
see each others' subtrees.  As the number of users grows, it also
complicates the namespaces considerably, as each set of subtrees must be
replicated over and over.
<p>
This loss of isolation and explosion of mount points can be avoided through
the use of "unbindable" mounts, a new feature added by the sharable
subtrees patch.  Said mounts cannot be
bound into other places, and will not be propagated into new subtrees.  So
the administrator could execute a series of commands like:
<p>
<pre>
    mount --bind /subtree /subtree
    mount --make-unbindable /subtree
</pre>
<p>
This incantation turns <tt>/subtree</tt> into a magic point which cannot be
rebound.  If, after this has been done, the administrator makes the
per-user bind mounts of the root filesystem, the portion under
<tt>/subtree</tt> will be pruned, with a result which looks like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees3.png" width=422 height=149
alt="[diagram]" hspace=2 border=0>
</center>
<p>
Now imagine that the system administrator mounts a CDROM under
<tt>/mnt</tt>.  The result will look like:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees4.png" width=548 height=149
alt="[diagram]" hspace=2 border=0>
</center>
<p>
Note that the CDROM mount is not visible in the per-user namespaces, so bob
and alice will be unable to look at the contents of the CD.  That might be the
intended result, but imagine it's not, that the administrator wants all
users to be able to see things mounted on <tt>/mnt</tt>.  The answer is a
"sharable" mount, one which is automatically propagated into every place
where the original mount appears.  So, the administrator need only perform
another new incantation:
<pre>
    mount --bind /mnt /mnt
    mount --make-shared /mnt
</pre>
After this, <tt>/mnt</tt> is a sharable mount.  Any changes made there will
appear in any namespace where <tt>/mnt</tt> appears.  The resulting tree
would look something like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees5.png" width=548 height=189
alt="[diagram]" hspace=2 border=0>
</center>
<p>
Many administrators might rather just make the entire filesystem tree
sharable, rather than try to anticipate where changes could be made.  If
the root is made sharable in this way, any new filesystems which are
mounted will propagate throughout the tree.  This propagation works all
ways; if alice mounts the CD within her subtree, it will still appear in
all of the subtrees.
<p>

Of course, this behavior might not always be desirable.  If, for example, bob is
using FUSE to mount an "ssh filesystem" from a remote host, he would prefer
that this filesystem not be visible to other users at all.  But bob would
still like to see filesystems mounted elsewhere, and does not want to give
up the advantages of a shared subtree.  The answer is yet another type of
mount, called a "slave" mount.  Slave mounts are selfish: they remain tied
to their parent mount, and receive new mounts from there.  Anything mounted
underneath the slave mount, however, will not be propagated elsewhere.  So
each user can have his or her own filesystems which are not part of the
global hierarchy:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/subtrees6.png" width=446 height=189
alt="[diagram]" hspace=2 border=0>
</center>
<p>
The shared subtrees patch also adds a "private" mount type, which is
essentially how mounts in 2.6.14 and prior kernels work.  A private mount
will not be propagated to any other mounts, but it can (unlike an
unbindable mount) be explicitly propagated via a bind operation.
<p>
Internally, the patches create the concept of a "peer group," among which
mount events are propagated.  A new <tt>mnt_share</tt> field (a list of
peers) has been added to the <tt>vfsmount</tt> structure for this purpose.
A couple of other lists (<tt>mnt_slave_list</tt> and <tt>mnt_slave</tt>)
have been added for keeping track of slave mount relationships.  A new
<tt>MNT_UNBINDABLE</tt> flag marks unbindable mounts.  And, of course, a
great deal of locking work has been done to make all of this work in a safe
manner.  Al Viro has worked with a few iterations of the shared subtrees
patch, with the result that it is now considered to be ready for the
mainline. 
<p>

The shared subtrees patch is a big step forward: it is a fundamental change
to the virtual filesystem layer which greatly increases the flexibility in
how namespaces can be populated and presented to users.  What remains, at
this point, is some work on the namespace side of things.  Namespaces are
still unnamed objects which can only be inherited from a parent process;
there is no easy way to create and attach to a per-user namespace.
Finishing the job will take some work, but, chances are, the hardest part
of the problem has been solved.

      One thing that might be useful here is a modification to mount(1) that allows the mounting of filesystems of specific types (listed in /etc/user-mountable-filesystems?) by any user *on top of any directory that user has write access to*. (I'm slightly concerned about /tmp, but not very. /tmp should probably be remounted separately in each user's subtree in any case in a system making use of this patch.)<br>

      How about "any directory the user owns, or has write access to but does not have the sticky bit set"?  Quick refresher on the sticky bit from the chmod(1) manpage:
<PRE>STICKY DIRECTORIES
       When  the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may
       be unlinked or renamed only by root or their owner.  Without the sticky
       bit,  anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files.
       The sticky bit is commonly found on directories, such as /tmp, that are
       world-writable.</PRE>

      Yes; that would mean that only world-writable directories (which strike me as a really bad idea) would be `problematic'.<br>
<p>
(And for those of us giving each user their own /tmp, well, we can turn the sticky bit off and fix up the permissions so that only that user can write to it :) )<br>

      Well, that case should be safe, since it happens before any users could be on the system (since the root directory of their namespaces hasn't been mounted yet, aside from anything else). Other uses might not be so safe, though.<br>

      I think this will help make diskless workstations also more maintainable. In this case you can have a master tree that you keep patched and then have your subtrees which are then exported to each workstation. You can patch the master and see the patches show up cleanly in the multiple workstations without having to patch each workstation. (Except for files in the workstation that are not shared :)).<br>

      Well, yes and no.  You still need some extra hacks to make package post-install scripts get everything right in all of the /etc sub-directories for example.  But you're right, this could make the process somewhat easier.<br>

      How do shared trees and chroot relate?<br>
Is it possible to implement some kind of chroot using this?<br>

      My understanding is that chroot creates a new namespace whereas the shared subtrees patch configures relationships between the namespaces. The answer to your second question is probably negative.  It would be like implementing mkdir using chmod.

      shared subtrees allows you to create identical mount trees at different locations. It does more than that, but in general it makes sure that the<br>
subtrees remain identical even after a series of mount and unmounts, in any of the subtrees.<br>
<p>
Chroot is a entirely different thing. It helps set a process up in a jail<br>
Once in a jail the process wont be able to access anything outside the directory tree. Neither do any of its children.<br>
<p>
But the combination of shared subtree and chroot togather have lot of applications. One example is mentioned in the article, where we can have a identical subtree for each user(thanks to shared subtree semantics). And each user can get jailed in its corresponding subtree (thanks to chroot).<br>

      the namespace terminology used here is bit off.  <br>
In Linux a namespace is the entire mount-tree. A namespace can be accessed only by the processes that created that namespace and all its children provided the child has not forked off its own namespace.<br>
<p>
The namespace terminology is used in this article to mean identical subtrees within a given namespace. <br>
<p>
Otherwise I feel the article has clearly and concisely touched upon this rather complicated idea.<br>

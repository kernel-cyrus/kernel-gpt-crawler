Sometimes a casual comment can capture your imagination and not let
go until you do something with it.  So it was for me with a comment made
by Heikki Orsila on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111049168280159033135/posts/4njRkH5jCa5">some
observations</a> that Greg Kroah-Hartman made about documentation in the
Linux kernel tree:
</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    Greg, the documentation is very bad.
</div>
<p>
The specific documentation that he or Greg were thinking of may well
be very different from the specific documentation that my thoughts
turned to, but as both a producer and a consumer of some parts of
<tt>linux/Documentation</tt> I can at least agree that some of it
isn't very good.
</p><p>
Heikki continued: "<q>Linux is badly documented, but so what?</q>" and often
that would have been the end of it.  But we are an open development community
where putting up with mediocrity is neither necessary nor encouraged.
If things are broken then there is always the possibility of fixing
them if only we know how.  How, then, can we fix the documentation?
</p><p>
"Documentation" is a broad category and I would like to start by
narrowing our focus a little and
excluding reference documentation from consideration.  By this I mean
documents used by a person knowledgeable in the subject who needs to
clarify some detail such as the arguments to some function or the
required ordering between two locks.  For these details the source
code is by far the best resource - as it cannot get out-of-date - and,
when the code itself is not sufficient, placing the documentation in
the source code will provide the greatest likelihood of it being
found, read, and kept up-to-date.  It doesn't really belong in a
separate <tt>Documentation</tt> directory.
</p><p>
The class of documentation that is of interest is documentation for
the new developer, not necessarily new to development but new to a
particular project or subsystem.  Such a developer combines a lack of
knowledge with a genuine interest and this is a combination that is
not stable:  if one component does not disappear soon, the other is
likely to.  The task of good documentation is to ensure the lack of
knowledge disappears before the interest.
</p><p>
I was exposed to this instability when
trying to understand some details of power management in Linux.  The
documentation simply didn't help and I had to look elsewhere.
However when I went back to assess the documentation while preparing
for this article I discovered that it wasn't as bad as I remembered.
I now had enough experience that it all made sense.  The paucity of
the documentation was now only in my memory and I couldn't be sure I
had given that documentation a fair trial.  The temptation to just
move on might have won had Heikki Orslia's observation not
encouraged me on.
</p><p>
To understand what makes good documentation we need to mine the
experiences from that short window of naive interest to find out
what works and what doesn't.
A question that seems most suited for digging is
"What were you looking for that you didn't find".
I'm sure my kind reader will have their own answers
to offer, but here are three that I have found on my travels.
</p>
<h4>Wire-frame outlines</h4>
<p>
When I first went to the Linux power management documentation I was
after a "big picture" understanding.  I wanted more detail than "this
code manages power" but not quite "these are the entry points that a
driver must provide".  I wanted to know what the important parts were
and, significantly, how they connected together and impacted each
other.  I picture this as a collection of key concepts together with
the linkage between them.  These are nodes and edges in a graph,
entities and relationships, or for the more spatially oriented,
vertices and edges of a wire-frame polyhedron.  This gives the shape
of the project without getting bogged down in details.
</p><p>
For me it is vital to have this framework first as I can only take in
and retain new details if I have something to attach them to and a
place to attach them.  Without it I'll either attach new ideas to the
wrong place, or forget them completely - which is probably the safer
of the two.
</p><p>
The image of a wire-frame is a little misleading as it presents all
vertices as of equal value and this is rarely the case.  Some concepts
are bigger and should be named and described first.  Others can come
later.  So maybe a ball-and-stick model might be a better picture,
with big and small balls, joined by thin and fat sticks.
</p><p>
In the case of Linux power management, one key concept that gives
shape to the whole is the number of multiplicities: there are multiple
sequencing states when moving away from or towards full functionality,
multiple power saving approaches such as runtime, suspend, and
hibernate, and many multiple different sorts of devices that need to
fit into the frameworks.  Another concept, already hinted at but often
recurring, is that there is generally one "fully functional" state but
several "low power" states, where moving between two low power states
involves returning to fully-functional and then reducing power a
different way.
</p>
<h4>Why, not what.</h4>
<p>
"Swap over NFS" is a set of functionality that some people find
valuable, but is not at all straightforward to implement.  There is a
need to avoid deadlocks in memory management, and to do so without
slowing down either the networking code or the memory allocation code,
both of which are quite performance sensitive.   There is <a href="/Articles/504262/">a set of
patches</a> which provides this functionality but getting it ready for
mainline inclusion has been a slow process.
</p><p>
Andrew Morton was recently good enough to provide some review of these
patches and, while reading the commit-log entries and code comments is
a little different from seeking out more coherent documentation, it does
provide a good window into the thoughts of someone who, while
generally knowledgeable, is both new to the project specifics and still
interested. It can thus answer the question "what were you looking for
that you didn't find?".
</p><p>
One observation that he made repeatedly is most clearly
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/5/1/307">embodied</a> in
</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    The comment should explain "why", not "what".  Particularly when the
    "what" was bleedin obvious ;)
</div>
<p>
or more humorously in: "<q><tt>s/"what"/"why"/&nbsp;!</tt></q>".
<p>
Documenting <i>what</i> a function does is very important in closed-source
projects, but less so in open source where the code can be directly
read.  Of course if the code is long and complex it might be easier to
read some documentation, however the effort of writing the
documentation might be better spent in breaking up the code and making
it more readable.
</p><p>
Documenting <i>why</i> is much more valuable, whether it is "why do it
this way" or "why even do this at all".  The "why" of a project is
rarely explicit in just one place of the code.  Rather it permeates
throughout and can touch various fragments in different ways.
Sometimes the "why" is not technical at all but is historical,
cultural, or simply subjective.  In these cases it really cannot be
extracted by reading the code and must be documented, or lost.
</p><p>
Were I to properly document the Linux "md" driver, for which I get
occasional requests, I would need to explain its relationship with
"dm" - for it isn't only internal edges of our wire-frame that are
interesting, but also external edges.  The "why"s here are mostly
historical accident, though there would be value in observing that
"md" focuses on reliability through redundancy, while "dm" focuses
more on flexibility by hiding all the other restrictions imposed by
storage hardware.  This, I think, gives the "why" for continuing to
have two separate frameworks, even if it isn't a strong technical
justification.
</p><p>
To continue with the analogy of the wire-frame model, if the concepts
and relationships provide the shape of the model, then the "Why"s
provide the fabric that they give shape to.  They are the substance
that gives purpose and the force that gives direction.  They may not
always be visible, especially once we put some skin on our model, but
understanding them is key to understanding the whole.
</p>
<h4>Examples, examples, examples.</h4>
<p>
One of the documents that I maintain is the set of manual pages for
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm">mdadm</a>.
I recall some years ago being challenged that there weren't enough
examples in that documentation.  At the time I didn't really know what
to do with the challenge as, after all, there was an "Examples" section
at the end of the man page and there was plenty of explanatory
material from which you can deduce your own examples.  Though I didn't
give it much attention then, this challenge clearly stuck in my mind
even to today and on reflection I now think quite differently to how I
thought then.  Examples matter.
</p><p>
For those of us who enjoy binary taxonomies, there are two sorts of reasoning
processes: deductive and inductive.  These are described in various ways in the
literature.  One that is particularly succinct and helpful is from
<a href="http://www.nakedscience.org/mrg/Deductive%20and%20Inductive%20Reasoning.htm">
Naked Science</a> which describes the distinction as:
</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
   Deductive reasoning arrives at a specific conclusion based on
   generalizations. Inductive reasoning takes events and makes
   generalizations.
</div>
<p>
In the context of documentation, reasoning is the process of turning the
words in the document into a model in your mind.  Different people
appear to vary in which style of reasoning they are most comfortable with,
so good documentation must attempt to play to both styles.
</p><p>
Documentation that plays to deductive reasoning will be filled with
generalizations.  This doesn't mean that it avoid details (as
generalities would) but that it attempts to describe exactly - in
complete generality - what each interface does, or how each concept
applies, or what role each interaction plays.  Such documentation can
be very useful, but is can also lead to a feeling that you are
drowning in detail.  It can be a challenge to extract meaning and
importance from such details.  A lot of technical documentation seems
to tend to this extreme.
</p><p>
Documentation that plays to inductive reasoning will be full of
examples of specific cases.  It may explain each case very well but
the coverage of the cases can never be perfect and it will
inevitably leave out some information, typically the particular
information that the reader is looking for.  "How-tos" are a good
example of this sort of document with maybe the extreme case being
recipe books for cooking - they are full of sample recipes with very
little space dedicated to explaining what makes a good recipe.
These are very good if they chose just the right
example, fairly good and quite accessible if they have chosen a good
variety of examples, but usually lacking when you want to get down to
the nitty-gritty.
</p><p>
Documentation that plays to both types of reasoning will mix examples in with the
generalizations, using them to embellish and explain those
generalizations and as an excuse to make diversions into tangentially
related topics.  Examples are particularly good at highlighting
contrasts which are themselves an important part of describing key
concepts and clarifying why choices are made.  The various
multiplicities noted for Linux power management can doubtlessly
provide lots of contrasts such as that between a "UART" serial driver
that must be ready to receive full-rate data whenever it is not off,
as opposed to a "USB" serial driver which only needs to be able to
respond to a wake-up signal and has plenty of time to prepare itself
for full data-rate messages.  These would necessarily make different
decisions about allowable power states.
</p><p>
Returning to our wire-frame model which gives shape
to some substance, it hopefully is not too much of a stretch to see
examples as the skin on the model.  These are the bits we can directly
see, they reveal the texture or taste of the whole, and only hint at the
bigger picture behind them.  But they are an important part in closing
the gaps that are left out of the big-picture descriptions.
</p>
<h4>A worked example?</h4>
<p>
Having all these goals for introductory documentation may be nice, but
are they actually useful? Can they lead to truly "good" documentation?
Clearly they are not enough by themselves, but when combined with
enough knowledge and experience, with some story-telling ability and an
occasional touch of humor I believe that they can.  To put this to
the test, I've used them as a guide to producing some introductory
documentation on Linux power management.  The results will be presented next
week when you, dear reader, can be the judge of whether the
resulting documentation is actually "good".

Thanks for the feedback. I'm sorry the analogy didn't work for you.  Probably I didn't explain it very well.<br>
<p>
The analogy was not meant to be with the documentation exactly but with the mental model you build.  While you a reading a document you build a model in your mind of the thing being described.  A model has various elements which I identified with the wire-frame, substance, and skin of a physical model.<br>
<p>
The document needs to support the creation of all of these elements in your model by describing structure, purpose, and examples.<br>
<p>
I hope that helps.<br>

I actually want *both* sorts of documentation. The big picture is certainly required but fine details matter too. MPI fails to document certain critical details which renders it useless for some tasks: the *sane* behaviour solution is obvious but the MPI standard does not quite mandate it.<br>
<p>
Let it suffice to say the correctness of some of my PhD thesis depends critically on TCP providing per socket queue limits and not an overall limit for all queues together. This is the sort of detail that can only be determined by reading reference documentation.<br>
<p>
I find writing hard. Research which took two weeks to do took more than a month to turn into a ~4 pages (and morphed a bit in the process).<br>

<p>
I would call that big picture, not something for a reference manual.  The only way I'd find it in a reference manual is if I already knew it were there and enough about it to know the words or subroutine names to search for.

One thing the mdraid documentation would benefit from would be "process" or "sequence" examples. The manpage shows a bunch of "this does...and this does..." isolated examples, but there's not many sequence examples.<br>
<p>
For example:<br>
1) Create a raid with a set of properties<br>
1a) Examine the array's properties<br>
2) Start the array<br>
2a) Examine the array's properties<br>
3) Fail out a member of the raid<br>
3a) Examine the array's properties<br>
4) Replace the member of the raid ( alternately, re-add it)<br>
4a) Examine the array's properties<br>
5) Stop the array<br>
5a) Examine the array's properties<br>
6) Dismantle the array<br>
6a) Examine the array's properties<br>
<p>
Just that sequence of example steps would be *incredibly* instructive to a first-time user.<br>

The problem I have with documentation is often that there is too much of it that is out of date and abandoned. Even the documentation directory in the kernel contains stuff that although it may still work really applies to the 2.4 kernel era.<br>

Sorry, offtopic, but...<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; "md" focuses on reliability through redundancy, while "dm" focuses more on flexibility by hiding all the other restrictions imposed by storage hardware. This, I think, gives the "why" for continuing to have two separate frameworks</font><br>
<p>
Well my observation is that un-reliability *is* a restriction of the storage hardware, and redundancy hides this restriction.<br>
<p>
So "md" only cares about one particular restriction and "dm" about all of them? I don't buy your argument that we need both.<br>

</div>
"Volatile ranges" are special regions of memory containing data that the
owner application can regenerate if need be.  If the system runs short of
memory, the kernel is free to evict data from a volatile range, but
otherwise the space is usable for activities like caching.  The volatile
range concept was raised again at the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory Management Summit, in two separate sessions.  This article is a
combined look at both discussions.
<p>

The first session started with an overview of the latest incarnation of the
volatile ranges and <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> APIs; see <a
href="/Articles/590991/">this article</a> for an overview of those
proposals.  One question that came up repeatedly concerned the need for a
separate <tt>vrange()</tt> system call for volatile ranges.  Some of the
incarnations of that work have used <tt>madvise()</tt> instead, and some
developers think that is the better approach.  It turns out that one of the
biggest arguments against an <tt>madvise()</tt> interface has to do with
the process of marking pages as no longer being volatile.  In that case,
the system call needs to return two separate values: (1)&nbsp;how much
memory was successfully marked non-volatile, and (2)&nbsp;whether any pages
were purged by the kernel while they were marked as volatile.
<tt>madvise()</tt> only allows for one return value, so it cannot be used
to create that kind of interface.
<p>

Should the interface indicate <i>which</i> pages have been purged when a
range is marked non-volatile?  The current code returns a single boolean
value indicating only whether any pages have been purged at all.  Hugh
Dickins said that some users would like to have more detailed information.
That said, there does not appear to be any plan to extend the interface in
that direction at this point.
<p>
Another question has to do with page aging.  When pages are marked as being
volatile, should they be "aged" to look like they have not been referenced
for a long time?  Aging the pages in that way would cause them to be among
the first that are reclaimed if the system encounters memory pressure.
There does not seem to be much consensus on whether this kind of aging
should be performed; if it is added, it might be under the control of a
separate flag allowing user space to select the behavior it wants.
<p>
Hugh said he didn't like the <tt>vrange()</tt> name; he would rather see
the name be a verb describing the action that is to be performed.  There
was also talk of making an <tt>madvise2()</tt> system call that would be
able to provide the needed API.  In the end, though, suggestions for better
names have been in short supply, and Hugh agreed that, given all the
revisions that volatile ranges have been through, keeping that
functionality as a separate system call might be the best approach to take.
<p>
Keith Packard raised a related use case that he has: graphics drivers can
allocate large amounts of memory for caching that they can give up if need
be.  But the existing shrinker interface is not actually invoked often by
the kernel, so he ends up holding memory rather longer than is warranted.
Perhaps the volatile range functionality could be made available in a form
that could be used by drivers as well?
<p>
A couple of other API issues came up toward the end of the session.  One
had to do with what happens if a process writes to memory that is in a
volatile range: in that case, should the memory remain volatile, or should
writing the memory automatically make it non-volatile?  Some developers
would like to see the latter behavior, but John Stultz, the author of
current versions of the patch, is uncomfortable with changing the state of
pages on writes in that way.
<p>
The current interface is memory-based, in that a volatile range is
described by a base address and a length.  Some versions of the patch have,
instead, used a file-based interface, where a volatile range is described
as a portion of a file.  The Android "ashmem" subsystem, which, it is
hoped, can be replaced by volatile ranges someday, uses a file-based
interface, but John said that it could be changed internally to use a
memory-based method instead.  Keith had a bit of a stronger requirement for
a file-based interface, though.  The graphics system, he said, does not
normally have addresses for most of the memory it uses for caching, and
mapping all of that memory could create problems on 32-bit systems where
there is not a lot of address space available.  So he would rather see a
file-based API.
<p>
In the end, there was little in the way of concrete conclusions from this
session.  There will certainly be another version of the volatile ranges
patch set at some point, but what it will look like is not entirely clear.

One of things I always thought was interesting about the win16 and 16bit os2 segmented memory architecture (at least back on the 286 era stuff, it may have been removed later) was the notion of segments being able to be marked as containing data that could simply be regenerated or reloaded if the memory was needed by other processes. That idea seemed lost to user space. I think it's worth point out that is still different from the related concept of the os asking a program to ease up on some usage sometime talked about with out of memory killer schemes. <br>
<p>
Of course that really brings up the whole "less S-RAM" vs. "tons of D-RAM + cache + wasteful memory usage" discussion, but I digress from my digression.<br>
<p>
I would love to hear more history if anyone has it. <br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 2, 2018</br>
           </div>
The Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem allows security
modules to hook into many low-level operations within the kernel; modules
can use those hooks to examine each requested operation and decide whether
it should be allowed to proceed or not.  In theory, just about every
low-level operation is covered by an LSM hook; in practice, there are some
gaps.  A discussion regarding one of those gaps — low-level
<tt>ioctl()</tt> operations on XFS filesystems — has revealed a thorny
problem and a significant difference of opinion on what the correct
solution is.
<p>
In late September Tong Zhang <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5EF0D46A-C098-4B51-AD13-225FFCA35D4C@vt.edu/">pointed
out</a> that <tt>xfs_file_ioctl()</tt>, the 300-line function that
dispatches the various <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations that can be performed on
an XFS filesystem, was making a call to <tt>vfs_readlink()</tt> without
first consulting the <tt>security_inode_readlink()</tt> LSM hook.  As a
result, a user with the privilege to invoke that operation
(<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>) could read the value of a symbolic
link within the filesystem, even if the security policy in place would
otherwise forbid it.  Zhang suggested that a call to the LSM hook should be
added to address this problem.
<p>
XFS developer Dave Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180926013329.GD31060@dastard/">disagreed</a>, saying
that such operations are below the level that security modules should be
operating at:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I really don't think these interfaces are something the LSMs should
	be trying to intercept or audit, because they are essentially
	internal filesystem interfaces used by trusted code and not general
	user application facing APIs.
</div>
<p>
Many of the operations carried out by XFS <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands, such
as deduplication of file contents, fast backups, and defragmentation,
require bypassing all protections that apply at higher levels; an LSM just
isn't relevant at this level, Chinner argued.
<p>
Unsurprisingly, others were not entirely on board with this point of view.
Stephen Smalley, the maintainer of the SELinux LSM, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/dc3bf978-1b98-bebd-6f35-9b2795693ea7@tycho.nsa.gov/">said</a>
that "<q>if they are interfaces exposed to userspace, then they should
be mediated via LSM</q>".  Alan Cox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180926192426.472360ea@alans-desktop/">added</a> that
"<q>in a secure environment low level complete unrestricted access to
the file system is most definitely something that should be
mediated</q>".  Neither seemed to think that there was anything
particularly special about <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations on XFS filesystems.
And there could be security benefits to proper LSM coverage; Cox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181001160442.47c798bc@alans-desktop/">described</a>
a scenario where these operations are fully mediated:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	With a proper set of LSM checks you can lock the filesystem
	management and enforcement to a particular set of objects. You can
	build that model where for example only an administrative login
	from a trusted console may launch processes to do that management.
</div>
<p>
There are, according to Chinner, a few significant problems with this
particular vision of how the system should work.  <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180927013812.GF31060@dastard/">One of those</a> is
that the kernel is full of <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations that carry out
privileged tasks.  In theory, the <tt>security_file_ioctl()</tt> hook
mediates access to those operations, but there are vast numbers of them and
no security module can be expected to recognize and properly reason about
even a small fraction of them.  Outside of the context where a given
<tt>ioctl()</tt> command is implemented, it is difficult to make any sense
out of what that command will do or what security policies should apply to
it.   <tt>ioctl()</tt> is, by its nature, a black box that can do just
about anything.
<p>
Since there are so many of these operations, just adding LSM checks to the
XFS operations, even if it could be done correctly, would not solve the
problem.  Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181001002521.GM31060@dastard/">pointed out</a>
that the device-mapper <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations are also only protected
by a <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> check, with no LSM involvement.  As a result,
an attacker with root privileges could simply remap blocks underneath the
filesystem.  Many operations at the block-device level also only check for
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.  As a result, he said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The storage stack is completely dependent on a simplistic layered
	trust model and that root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) is god. The storage trust
	model falls completely apart if we don't have a trusted root user
	to administer all layers of the storage stack.
</div>
<p>
This trust model has created problems at other times, he added.  The
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> checks have had to be tightened up to only allow
operations when the user is privileged in the initial namespace; otherwise
user namespaces create problems.  The issues around <a
href="/Articles/755593/">unprivileged mount operations</a> also trace back
to this trust model.  Fixing this problem now is far from straightforward.
<p>
There are also some practical issues; adding an LSM check now risks
breaking scripts in the wild, creating regressions that would have to be
reverted.  Some regressions <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180927020822.GG31060@dastard/">could be
severe</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	As such, there are very few trusted applications have "massive data
	loss" as a potential failure mode if an inappropriately configured
	LSM is loaded into the kernel. Breaking a HSM application's access
	to the filesystem unexpectedly because someone didn't set up a new
	security policy correctly brings a whole new level of risk to
	administrating sites that mix non-trivial storage solutions with
	LSM-based security.
</div>
<p>

Ted Ts'o <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181001152529.GA2549@thunk.org/">suggested</a> that
anybody who wants to control low-level filesystem operations with security
modules should sit down and specify how the whole thing would work:
"<q>a formal security model, and detail *everything* that would need to
be changed in order to accomplish it</q>".  The resulting changes, he
predicted, would have to be made in "<q>a really huge number of
places</q>".  Chances are, this request will bring the conversation to a
close in the near future.  While there may be numerous developers who would
like to see the system's behavior changed in this regard, most of them are
likely to shy away once they realize how much work would be required to do
the job in a way that would actually increase security without causing
regressions.  It may well be many years too late to try to add that level
of security to Linux.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Whilst not strictly an answer to your question, the Rainbow Series essentially defines security labelling. It includes filesystems and devices. It has been a while since I read the books, so can't tell you precisely what it covers.<br>
<p>
The classic secure OS' are MULTICS, VMS, Open IRIX and Open Solaris. The Linux security system descends from Flask. All borrow from the security kernel paper.<br>
<p>
Far as I know, this mass of wisdom says it should be covered but it might not necessarily be.<br>

Couldn't we just declare that CAP_SYS_ADMIN includes most if not all other privileges?  It would be a truly bizarre setup that granted a user or process the right to do sysadmin-level operations (to XFS or anything else) but forbade them to read a symlink.<br>
<p>
Fine-grained privileges are all very well, and there is sometimes a case for limiting the access even of an administrator, and sometimes a case for restricting an operation even if in principle the user could get round it with some other privilege.  But some common-sense limits have to apply.  Why go through the charade of checking access restrictions for a CAP_SYS_ADMIN process which is clearly meant to be superuser-level?<br>

It should be noted that these interfaces are not unmediated by LSM.  Capabilities are stacked by the LSM framework with whatever major LSM you have loaded, so you can still use e.g. SELinux policy to mediate use of Linux capabilities.  The issue here is that this is likely too coarse grained, as CAP_SYS_ADMIN covers way too many things. Adding new capabilities or perhaps distinct LSM hooks may help decompose out these admin storage operations.<br>

How about exposing control operations in a fs of its own, so that every file becomes a capability to do something (like writing 1 to /sys/fs/xfs/maint/scrub).<br>

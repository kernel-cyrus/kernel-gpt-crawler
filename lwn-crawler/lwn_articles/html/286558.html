Arjan van de Ven's kernel oops report always makes for interesting reading;
it is a quick summary of what is making the most kernels crash over the
past week.  It thus points to where some of the most urgent bugs are to be
found.  Sometimes, though, this report can raise larger issues as well.
Consider the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/286520/">June&nbsp;16
report</a>, which notes that quite a few kernel crashes were the result of
a not-quite-ready wireless update shipped by Fedora.  Ingo Molnar was quick
to <a href="/Articles/286560/">jump on this report</a> with a
process-related complaint:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	i suspect Fedora has done this to enable more hardware, and/or to
	fix mainline wireless bugs?  I wish we would do such new driver
	merging in mainline instead, so that we had a single point of
	testing and single point of effort.
<p>
	Same for Nouveau: Fedora carries it and i dont understand why such
	a major piece of work is not done in mainline and not _helped by_
	mainline.
</div>
<p>
He then <a href="/Articles/286561/">took the discussion further</a> with
this observation:

<div class="BigQuote">
	That's my main point: when we mess up and dont merge OSS driver
	code that was out there in time - and we messed up big time with
	wireless - we should admit the screwup and swallow the bitter pill.
</div>
<p>
This comment drew some unhappy responses from the networking developers,
who feel that they have been unfairly targeted for criticism.  Wireless
drivers have been merged at the first real opportunity, they say, and
trying to put them in earlier would have only made things worse.  In fact,
your editor will submit that mistakes <i>were</i> made with wireless
drivers, but those mistakes have little to do with delaying their inclusion
into the mainline.  What went wrong with wireless is this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Early wireless developers did not really try to solve the wireless 
     networking problem; they just wanted to get their adaptor to work.
     Wireless maintainer John Linville once told your editor that, for
     years, these adaptors were treated as if they were Ethernet adaptors,
     which they certainly are not.  When these developers did get around to
     dealing with issues specific to wireless networking, they created
     their own wireless stacks contained within their drivers.  So no
     general wireless framework was created.
<p>
     It's only in 2004 that Jeff Garzik <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/87952/">started a project</a> to create
     a generic wireless stack for Linux - and he started with a
     stack (HostAP) which, sometime later on, was seen as not being the
     best choice.  So the work on HostAP - late to begin in the first place
     - was eventually abandoned.
<p>
<li> The networking stack which was eventually developed - mac80211 - began
     its life as a proprietary code base created with no community review
     or oversight at all.  Predictably, it had all kinds of problems which
     required well over a year of work to resolve.  Until mac80211 was in
     reasonable shape, there was no real way to get drivers ready for
     inclusion.
</ul>
<p>
The result of all this (and the occasional legal hassle as well) is that
wireless networking on Linux lagged for 
years, and is only now reaching something close to a stable state.  So it
is not surprising that there has been a lot of code churn in this area, or
that things occasionally break.  But it is hard to see how trying to merge
wireless drivers sooner would have helped the situation significantly.
<p>

The non-merging of the Nouveau driver - the reverse-engineered driver for
NVIDIA adapters - also has a simple explanation: the developers have not
yet asked for this merge to happen.  Nouveau is not considered to be at a
point where it works yet, and, importantly, there are still user-space API
issues which must be worked out.  Breaking user-space code is severely
frowned upon, so merging of code is nearly impossible if its user-space
interfaces are still in flux.
<p>

James Bottomley <a
href="https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2008-discuss/2008-June/000136.html">put
forward</a> another reason why a driver may stay out of the mainline even
though the author would like to see it merged:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	For the record, my own view is that when a new driver does appear
	we have a limited time to get the author to make any necessary
	changes, so I try to get it reviewed and most of the major issues
	elucidated as soon as possible.  However, since the only leverage I
	have is inclusion, I tend to hold it out of tree until the problems
	are sorted out.
</div>
<p>
In other words, their control over access to the mainline tree is the one
club subsystem maintainers have at hand when they feel the need to push a
developer to make changes to a driver.  It may well be that simply merging
drivers regardless of technical objections (something which a number of
developers are pushing for) will reduce the incentive for developers to get
their code into top shape - and it's not always clear that others will step
in and do the work for them.
<p>
On the other hand, the idea that in-tree code tends to be less buggy than
out-of-tree code is relatively uncontroversial.  So, for many drivers at
least, a "merge first and fix it up later" policy may well lead to the best
results in the shortest period of time.  One thing that is clear is that
this discussion will not be going away anytime soon; chances are good that
this year's kernel summit (happening in September) will end up revisiting
the issue.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      That really only works in the time between merging and the first stable release thereafter.  Once the driver is shipped, yanking it out will break things for users, and that's generally considered to be undesirable.

Seems like we might be able to learn a lesson from the delay in getting a decent wireless
stack.

Something (like this) likely to affect everybody is not that hard to identify. Every
distribution should recognize that a coordinated effort, probably with centralized resources,
possibly with special task funding would be a benefit to themselves. Could not someone (at
each distro) be charged with the job of looking for these needs/opportunities?

Maybe having high hurdles to inclusion is what makes in-tree code less buggy in the first place?  One wonders whether adopting the approach advocated by the second sentence above might make the first sentence less truthful.

      Sure, but to what degree? That is the interesting question, and it can be formulated as a trade-off. Is the increase in quality worth the initial bugginess?

<p>
Errors in the storage subsystem can happen due to a variety of known
or unknown reasons. A filesystem turns read-only when it encounters
errors in the storage subsystem, or a code path which the filesystem
code base should not have taken (i.e. a <tt>BUG()</tt> path). Making the filesystem
read-only is a safeguard feature that filesystems implement to avoid
further damage because of the errors encountered. Filesystems that change to
read-only end up stalling services relying on data writes and, in some
cases, may lead to an unresponsive system. In embedded devices, dying
applications due to a filesystem turning read-only may render the device
useless, leaving the user confused.

<p>
Filesystem errors can either be recoverable or non-recoverable.
Errors from bad block links in the inode data structures or block
pointers can be recovered by filesystem checks. On the other hand, errors due to
memory corruption, or a programming error, might not be recoverable
because one cannot be sure which data is correct.

<p>
Denis Karpov proposed a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/337492/">patchset</a> that would notify  
user space, so that a user-space policy can be defined to take the
appropriate action to avoid turning the filesystem read-only. The
patchset is currently limited to FAT filesystems. User-space
notifications would allow a filesystem to continue to be used after
encountering "correctable errors" if proactive measures are taken to
correct them. Such corrective
actions can obviate the need for lengthy filesystem checks when the
device is mounted next.

<p>
The patchset adds a <tt>/sys/fs/fat/&lt;volume&gt;/fs_fault</tt> file which is
initialized 
to 0 when the filesystem is mounted. The value of <tt>fs_fault</tt> changes
to 1 on 
error. A user-space program can <tt>poll()</tt> on this file to check if the
value of the file changed which is an indication that an error has occurred.
Besides the file polling, a <tt>KOBJ_CHANGE</tt> uevent is generated, with
the uevents environment variable <tt>FS_UNCLEAN</tt> set to 0 or 1. A udev
rule can then
trigger the correct program to take care of the damage done by the
error.

<p>
Kay Sievers is <a href="/Articles/337767/">not
convinced</a> with the idea of using  
uevents for user-space notifications, as uevents are designed for
device notifications, so they do not fit the design goals of reporting
filesystem errors. Filesystem errors are quite often a repeated series
of events. For example, a read failure may result in printing multiple
read errors in dmesg for each block it is not able to read. An event
generated for each block may be too much for udev to handle. Some of
the events may get lost, or worse still, may cause udev to ignore
uevents from other devices which occurred during the burst of
errors.

<div class="BigQuote">
Uevents have no state, and the information is lost after the event.
Uevents can not block, they need to finish in userspace immediately,
you can not queue them up or anything else, it would block other
operations. Uevents can _never_ be used to transport high frequent
event streams. They might render the entire system unusable, if you
have lots of devices and many errors.

<p>
They could be used to get attention when a superblock does a one-time
transition from "clean" to "error", everything else would just get us
into serious trouble later.
</div>

<p>
Keeping <tt>&lt;volume&gt;/fs_fault</tt> in sysfs is also not the best solution,
because sysfs is unaware of filesystem namespaces. The primary
responsibility of sysfs is to expose core kernel objects. Filesystem
namespaces are a set of filesystem mounts that are only visible to a
particular  process and may be invisible to the rest of the processes.


<p>
A process with a private namespace contains a copy of the namespace
instead of a shared namespace. When the system starts, it contains one
global namespace which is shared among all processes. Mounts and
unmounts in a shared namespace are seen by all the processes in the
namespace. A process creates a private namespace if it was created by
the <tt>clone()</tt> system call using the <tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt> flag (clone New
NameSpace). A process sharing a public namespace can also create a private
namespace by calling <tt>unshare()</tt> with <tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt> flag. Mounts and
unmounts within a private namespace are only seen by the process that
created the namespace. A child process created by <tt>fork()</tt> shares its
parent's namespace.

<p>
Because of this, processes might receive errors on a filesystem in a
different namespace, so they would not know which device to act on.
The problem is also noticeable with processes accessing bind
mounts created in a different namespace (bind mounts are a feature in which a
sub-tree of a filesystem can be mounted on another directory).
Moreover, filesystems spanning multiple devices, such as btrfs, would
not be able to report the device name under the current naming
structure.

<p>
Kay <a href="/Articles/337768/">recommends</a>
<tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt> as a better alternative,
because it contains the list of mount points in the namespace of the
process with the specified PID (self).
Currently, <tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt> changes when the
mount tree changes. This can be extended to propagate errors to
user space in the correct namespace using <tt>poll()</tt>, regardless of
the device name.
<tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt> can accommodate optional fields which hold values
in the form of "tag[:value]" that can be used to communicate the nature of
the problem. Instead of using the existing udev infrastructure, this would require a dedicated application to monitor
<tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt>, identify the error by parsing the argument,
and act 
accordingly.


<p>
Jan Kara further <a href="/Articles/337769/">suggests</a>
using <tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt> as a link to identify the filesystem device
generating the errors:

<div class="BigQuote">
  What currently seems as the cleanest solution to me, is to add some
"filesystem identifier" field to /proc/self/mountinfo (which could be
UUID, superblock pointer or whatever) and pass this along with the
error message to user-space. Passing could be done either via sysfs (but I
agree it isn't the best fit because a filesystem need not be bound to a
device) or just via generic netlink (which has the disadvantage that you
cannot use the udev framework everyone knows)...
</div>


<p>
Despite these objections, everyone agrees that error reporting to
user space must not be limited to dmesg messages. User space
should be notified of the errors reported by the filesystem, so that it can
proactively handle errors and try to correct them. The namespace-unaware
<tt>/sys</tt> filesystem or notifications through uevent may not be the best
solution, but, for a lack of a better alternative interface,
the developers used sysfs and uevents. The design is still under
discussion, and will take some time to evolve, though it is likely
that some kind of solution to this problem will make its way into the kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks for the article!  It is good to hear that something is being done about this problem.<br>
<p>
I "forced" my wife to switch to Linux as her main desktop but she still needs Windows XP so she dual-boots and uses a FAT drive to share data between the 2 OSs.  Occasionally while using Linux, the FAT drive will become corrupted and switch to read-only and she is left wondering why she can't write to the FAT drive all of a sudden.  It would be nice if a user space program could tell her about the issue instead of her screaming "Fix it!" at me.<br>

in dmesg for each block it is not able to read. An event generated for <br>

<p>
I don't think user-space is interested about individual errors like on <br>
which block there's an error but that:<br>
- there's a file system error<br>
- which file system has the error<br>
- maybe the types/classes of errors on that file system<br>
<p>
I.e. at most the first error of certain type on certain file system should <br>
be reported.<br>
<p>
Btw. Regarding corrupted FAT file system, background file system indexing <br>
daemons sometimes behave in interesting ways when they encounter e.g. <br>
infinite list of directory entries or infinitely deep directory <br>
hierarchies on just mounted FAT file systems...    Kernel re-mounting <br>
buggy FS read-only doesn't help in these cases at all. (Such programs are <br>
of course buggy and should be fixed, but it's not always easy to find &amp; <br>
correct such errors in programs beforehand.)<br>

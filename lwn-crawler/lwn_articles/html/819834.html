           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 8, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
system call is a bit of a strange beast; it allows user space to take
responsibility for the handling of page faults, which is normally a
quintessential kernel task.  It is thus perhaps not surprising that it has
turned out to have some utility for those who would attack the kernel's
security as well.  A recent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200423002632.224776-1-dancol@google.com/">patch
set</a> from Daniel Colascione is small, but it makes a significant change
that can help block at least one sort of attack using
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt>.
<p>
A call to <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> returns a file descriptor that can be used
for control over memory management.  By making a set of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls, a
user-space process can take responsibility for handling page faults in
specific ranges of its address space.  Thereafter, a page fault within that range
will generate an event that can be read from the file descriptor; the process
can read the event and take whatever action is necessary to resolve the
fault.  It should then write a response describing that resolution to the same file
descriptor, after which the faulting code will resume execution.
<p>
This facility is normally intended to be used within a multi-threaded
process, where one thread takes on the fault-handling task.  There are a
number of use cases for <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>; one of the original cases
was handling live migration of a process from one machine to another.
The process can be moved and restarted on the new system while leaving most
of its memory behind; the pages it needs immediately can then be
demand-faulted across the net, driven by <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> events.
The result is less downtime while the process is being moved.
<p>
Since the kernel waits for a response from the user-space handler to
resolve a fault, page faults can cause an indefinite delay in the execution
of the affected process.  That is always the case, of course; for example, a process
generating a fault on memory backed by a file somewhere else on the network
will come to an immediate halt for an unknown period of time.  There is a
difference with <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>, though: the time it takes to
resolve the fault is under the process's direct control.
<p>
Normally, there are no problems that can result from that control; the
process is simply slowing itself down, after all.  But occasionally page
faults will be generated in the kernel.  Imagine, for example, just about
any system call that results in the kernel accessing user-space memory.
That can happen as the result of I/O, from a <tt>copy_from_user()</tt>
call, or any of a number of other ways.  Whenever the kernel accesses
user-space memory, it has to be prepared for the relevant
page(s) to not be present; the kernel has to incur and handle a page fault,
in other words.
<p>
An attacker can take advantage of this behavior to cause execution in the
kernel to block at a known point for a period of time that is under said
attacker's control.  In particular, the attacker can use
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> to take control of a specific range of memory; they
then ensure that none of the pages in that range are resident in RAM.  When
the attacker makes a system call that tries to access memory in that range,
they will get a <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> event helpfully telling them that
the kernel has blocked and is waiting for that page.
<p>
Stopping the kernel in this way is useful if one is trying to take
advantage of some sort of race condition or other issue.  Assume, for
example, that an attacker has identified a potential
time-of-check-to-time-of-use vulnerability, where the ability to change a
value in memory somewhere at the right time could cause the kernel to carry
out some ill-advised action.  Exploiting such a vulnerability requires
hitting the window of time between when the kernel checks a value and when
it acts on it; that window can be quite narrow.  If the kernel can be made
to block while that window is open, though, the attacker suddenly has all
the time in the world.  That can make a difficult exploit much easier.
<p>
Attackers can be deprived of this useful tool by disallowing the handling
in user space
of faults incurred in kernel space.  Simply changing the rules that way would almost
certainly break existing code, though, so something else needs to be done.
Colascione's patch addresses this problem in two steps, the first of which
is to add a new flag (<tt>UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY</tt>) for
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> which states that the resulting file descriptor can
only be used for handling faults incurred in user space.  Any descriptor
created with this flag thus cannot be used for the sorts of attacks
described above.
<p>
One could try politely asking attackers to add <tt>UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY</tt>
to their <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> calls, but we are dealing with people who
are not known for their observance of polite requests.  So the patch set
adds a new sysctl knob, concisely called
<tt>vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd_user_mode_only</tt>, to make the request
somewhat less polite; if it is set to one, <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> calls
from unprivileged users will fail if that flag is not provided.  At that
point, kernel-space fault handling will no longer be available to attackers
attempting to gain root access.  The default value has to be zero, though,
to maintain compatibility with older kernels.
<p>
The only response to this patch set so far came from Peter Xu, who <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200506193816.GB228260@xz-x1/">pointed out</a> that
the existing <tt>vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd</tt> knob could be extended
instead.  That knob can be used to disallow <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> entirely
for unprivileged processes by setting it to zero, though its default value
(one) allows such access.  Xu suggested that setting it to two would allow
unprivileged use, but for user-space faults only.  This approach saves
adding a new knob.
<p>
Beyond that, the suggested change seems uncontroversial.  It's a small patch that
has no risk of breaking things for existing users, so there does not appear
to be any real reason to keep it out.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I see the argument for it, but it's yet another obscure option. By default, it can't be turned on, so it won't provide any defense to most users. Considering "the existing vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd knob", is the cost of a feature to hobble but not disable userfaultfd really worth it? <br>

The cost is awfully small, and while another option isn’t perfect, distros can enable it if desired.  If it doesn’t break much, many or most will do so.<br>

It’s not perfect, but this option is low cost.<br>

My 2 cents: If you are not one a cloud provider, then you *probably* don't need userfaultfd() at all. It's the low-level equivalent of fiddling with the garbage collection algorithm, or writing your own malloc(). Basically, there are two use cases for this:<br>
<p>
1. You're doing live migrations of VMs.<br>
2. You can dynamically regenerate paged-out data faster than the OS can page it in.<br>
<p>
(1) makes very little sense if you control all of the code in the VM, because it's far easier to just use a container instead of a VM, and start/stop instances as required (with all state living in some kind of database-like-thing, or perhaps a networked filesystem, depending on your needs). Sure, this is slightly more upfront design work, but live migration consumes an incredible amount of bandwidth once you try to scale it up, whereas container orchestration is a mature and well-understood technology. Unless you are making money per VM, it's difficult to justify the cost of live migration.<br>
<p>
(Granted, if all of your VMs are very similar to one another, you might be able to develop a clever compression algorithm that shaves a lot of bytes off of that cost, but you're still not going to beat containers on size.)<br>
<p>
That leaves (2). What's happening in case (2) is that you're using the page fault mechanism as a substitute for some kind of LRU cache for data that is expensive to compute, but cheaper than actually hitting the disk. But you can build an LRU cache in userspace, and it'll probably be a lot more efficient and easier to tune, since you can design it to exactly fit your specific use case. Trying to rope page faults into that problem makes no logical sense.<br>
<p>
So, in conclusion, I'd tentatively suggest that distros consider turning the whole feature off and see if anything breaks. Perhaps they should teach their package managers to enable this setting if, and only if, one or more installed packages really need it.<br>

Live migration is ABSOLUTELY justified for cloud computing providers to protect against hypervisor vulnerabilities.<br>
<p>
Client workflows often can't be interrupted at will and even asking clients nicely to reboot their instances (so they can migrate to other hardware nodes) can take months. It's much easier to involuntarily migrate client VMs to different hardware.<br>

AWS doesn't support live migration. Live migration is useful, but not for cloud computing, where state is kept outside the node. It's useful for traditional architectures where state is maintained on the node, with only backups (hopefully!) elsewhere. Not just useful but critical, because you're packing more work on the same piece of hardware, so reboots are more disruptive than with dedicated hardware.<br>

It actually does behind the scenes with T2 and T3 instances. <br>

Live migration is very useful to move client software out of a failing node. So really this makes sense only for large cloud providers.<br>

Interesting. Any sources which I could share? All I could find in a quick Google search is an HN comment, "T2 and T3 use live migration to get around this, but it's not public knowledge." <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17815806">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17815806</a><br>

<p>
That is true in a lot of environments, especially when yo u are dealing with software that manages state. It's easy to say that one can design an application so this isn't necessary (though a lot of the container/cloud-native crowd completely ignores stateful systems), but the reality is very different. <br>

I don't understand the cloud provider argument. It does seem like this feature can help with live VM migration, but when you are a cloud provider, you don't necessarily require all users to run unmodified Linux kernels. If a user runs a non-Linux VM, how can the cloud provider migrate that VM?<br>

You're assuming data is paged out to begin with. :-) A prime candidate for this is if you want to mmap a compressed file (and have your application see uncompressed data).<br>

If the kernel handles compression/decompression matters, it's to save on paging space/speed. The user space sees nothing different.<br>

If the user space handles compression, the kernel doesn't care about it at all.<br>

Our Pernosco omnisicient, record-and-replay debugger uses userfaultfd() in a way that's neither 1 nor 2.<br>
<p>
We have a giant omniscient database which lets us reconstruct the memory state of a process at any point in its recorded history. Sometimes we want to execute an application function "as if" the process was at some point in that history. So we create a new process, ptrace it, create mappings in it corresponding to the VMAs that existed at that point in history, and enable userfaultfd() for those mappings. Then we set the registers into the right state for the function call and PTRACE_CONT. Every time the process touches a new page, we reconstruct the contents of that page from our database. Works great.<br>

I *think* a UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY flag/mode would work fine for us. We don't actually allow this fake process to execute syscalls normally; we catch its syscalls with ptrace and emulate them.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 8, 2022</br>
           </div>
Each new kernel release fixes a lot of bugs, but each release also
introduces new bugs of its own.  That leads to a fundamental
question: is the kernel community fixing bugs more quickly than it is adding
them?  The answer is less than obvious but, if it could be found, it
would give an important indication of the long-term future of the kernel
code base.  While digging into the kernel's revision history cannot give a
definitive answer to that question, it can provide some hints as to what
that answer might be.
<p>
<h4>Tagged fixes</h4>
<p>
In current kernel practice, a developer who fixes a bug is expected to
include a Fixes tag in the patch description identifying the commit that
introduced that bug.  This is a relatively recent practice; while various
forms of Fixes tags had appeared in commits for some time, the first patch
using the current form with the hash of the offending commit appears to be
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c511851de162">this revert</a> from
Rafael Wysocki for 3.12 in October 2013.  In that release, only two commits
identified buggy commits from previous releases, but the use of this tag
grew quickly in subsequent development cycles.  The 6.0 kernel release
included 2,784 commits with Fixes tags, 2,112 of which identified commits
from previous releases as the source of the bug being fixed (the remaining
commits fixed bugs that had been introduced in 6.0 and thus never appeared
in a released kernel).
<p>
Thus, in theory, one can simply count Fixes tags over a development cycle
to see how many bugs from previous releases were fixed.  Then, looking at
subsequent releases, the Fixes tags can be used to see how many bugs were
introduced in
that cycle and fixed in later cycles.  If the number of bugs fixed in a
development cycle
regularly exceeds the number of bugs introduced in that cycle, then chances
are good that 
the kernel is getting better over time.  The idea is simple, but runs into
some practical difficulties that will be explored later on.  We can
start with a plot showing how the above analysis comes out:
<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/release-fixes.svg"
     alt="[bugs introduced and fixed per release]"
     width=700 class="photo">
<p>
(This data can also be viewed in tabular form on <a
href="/Articles/914479/">this page</a>).
<p>
In the above plot, the thicker lines are counts of Fixes tags; so the brown "bugs
introduced" line is the number of times that a commit in a given release
was identified by a Fixes tag in subsequent releases, while the green "bugs
fixed" line shows
the number of Fixes tags in a given release identifying buggy commits in
previous releases.  The thinner lines are instead counting commits: "buggy
commits introduced" is the number of commits in a given release that were
later fixed, and "commits fixed" is the number of commits from previous
releases that were fixed in a given release.
<p>
The two sets of numbers differ for a simple reason: some commits are
sufficiently buggy that they need to be fixed more than once — a topic
we'll return to shortly.  There is an interesting difference here, though:
in any given development cycle, the number of bugs fixed tracks closely
with the number of commits fixed, but there is a big difference between the
number of bugs introduced and the number of buggy <i>commits</i>
introduced.  What we can conclude from this difference is that commits that
introduce a lot of bugs require multiple development cycles for all of
those bugs to be fixed.  It is rare to see a lot of fixes to the same
commit in any one development cycle.
<p>
Can this plot answer the question posed at the beginning of this article,
though?  A naive reading shows that the lines cross and that, thus, number
of bugs fixed exceeds the number of bugs introduced as of the 5.1 release.
But that result must clearly be taken with a fair amount of salt.  As has
been seen in other recent <a href="/Articles/909625/">examinations of Fixes
tags</a>, bugs lurk in the kernel for a long time.  Kernel developers are
still finding and fixing bugs introduced early in the 2.6 era — and before.
So the "bugs introduced" numbers for recent kernels are clearly too low, as
can be seen by the fact that those lines head toward zero for the most
recent releases.
<p>
The number of bugs introduced does appear, though, to level out in the
range of 1,200 to 1,400 per release; this can be seen in the older
releases, where the numbers are unlikely to change much at this point.
That trend seems to continue through about 5.8 or so, after which the curve
drops down and clearly does not reflect long-term reality.  Should this
pattern hold — something only time will tell — then the point where the
curves cross may move, but it seems likely to remain in the early 5.x era.  If that is
truly the case then, in recent times at least, the kernel community may
well be fixing more bugs than it is introducing.
<p>
What might have caused the situation to change?  Your editor does not know
but can wave his hands as well as anybody else.  One possibility is improved
development tools and, especially, the increased use of fuzz testing to
turn up old bugs and prevent new ones.  The slow but steady growth in the
kernel's (still inadequate) testing infrastructure will have helped.
Increased insistence on patch review may have helped to keep the number of
bugs introduced roughly constant even as the volume of code going into the
kernel has increased.  Or perhaps none of the above applies.
<p>
It is also almost certainly true that developers have become more
disciplined about adding Fixes tags, causing more bug fixes to actually be
counted as such while not actually reflecting a change in the rate at which
fixes are happening.  In general, Fixes tags may be the best proxy we have
for actual bug counts, but they are still an inaccurate metric; it depends on
developers to carefully add them and to correctly identify the commits that
introduce bugs.
<p>
<h4>The buggiest commits</h4>
<p>
One thing those tags might do reliably, though, is to identify the buggiest
commits in the kernel's history.  Remember that some commits require more
than one fix over time; some of them require quite a few more than one.
Here is a table of the most-fixed commits during the Git era:

<p>
One might wonder about what went wrong with Linux-2.6.12-rc2, which has
been fixed (at last count) 355&nbsp;times.  That is, of course, the initial
commit that started the Git era, so fixes identifying that commit are for
bugs that were introduced prior to April 2005.  Even in 2022, bugs of that
vintage are still being found and fixed.
<p>
After that, the conclusion to be drawn is not that surprising: the commits
that need a lot of fixes tend to be the large ones that add a significant
new subsystem.  A lot of new code will inevitably bring a fair number of
new bugs with it, and those bugs will need to be discovered and fixed over
time.  One interesting exception might be <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ca6fb0651883">ca6fb0651883</a>
("tcp: attach SYNACK messages to request sockets instead of listener")
which inserted 47&nbsp;lines in 2015 and has been fixed 21 times since,
most recently in February for 5.17.  Also noteworthy is <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=96c8395e2166">96c8395e2166</a>
("spi: Revert modalias changes"), which deleted six lines of code and has
required 24 fixes thereafter.  Beyond those, though, the commits needing a
large number of fixes have been large in their own right.
<p>
Perhaps more interesting is the fact that, of the 30 most-fixed commits
shown above, 22 are related to networking (including InfiniBand).  The
networking subsystem is a large part of the kernel, but it is still a small
piece of the whole and not the only subsystem that merges large patches.
It's not clear why networking-related patches, in particular, would be more
likely to need many fixes.
<p>
Bugs are a fact of life in software development, unfortunately, and we are
unlikely to be free of them anytime soon.  If an optimistic reading of the
data above reflects reality, though, then it is possible that the
kernel-development community may have reached a point where it is fixing
more bugs than it
introduces.  LWN will surely revisit this topic in the future to see how
the situation evolves.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

At least for some of the infiniband patches it is largely a quirk of how the original drivers were merged. One giant 57k loc commit for HFI makes it a huge target to capture all of the day 0 bug fixes. It is much more typical that such a big thing would be split to lots more patches and so the fixes lines will be diffused. Plus I'm very pedantic about including fixes lines in patches, even for things that are not functional bugs like spelling fixes and so on.<br>
<p>
What I find surprising is I don't see any FS in this list, are they not using fixes lines in the same way?<br>

It could be, however, that FS developers have smaller commits that are unlikely to individually need fixed a few dozen times? This example sounds like a "large commit" based on the commit summary at least…<br>

Statistics for btrfs since 4.7, with more than 5 fixes tags:<br>
<p>
      8 Fixes: afba2bc036b ("btrfs: zoned: implement active zone tracking")<br>
      7 Fixes: edf064e7c6f ("btrfs: nowait aio support")<br>
      6 Fixes: d2311e69857 ("btrfs: relocation: Delay reloc tree deletion after merge_reloc_roots")<br>
      6 Fixes: 7b508037d4c ("btrfs: defrag: use defrag_one_cluster() to implement btrfs_defrag_file()")<br>
      6 Fixes: 79787eaab46 ("btrfs: replace many BUG_ONs with proper error handling")<br>
      5 Fixes: 18bb8bbf13c ("btrfs: zoned: automatically reclaim zones")<br>
      5 Fixes: 16e7549f045 ("Btrfs: incompatible format change to remove hole extents")<br>
<p>
It's a mix of new features or functionality changes but with unforseen consequences, the patches are not that big on average (except 79787eaab46 which is merge of about 60 few-liner patches). In the sample there are about 600 Fixes tags, median is 1, average 1.29. With good change granularity at most one fixup is IMHO a good result, bug hunting usually improves understanding and there remaining bugs are fixed at once. The exceptions in the list are from specific use case or not widely tested (zoned mode) or hard to hit bugs, d2311e69857 took a long time to track down.<br>

I would expect lots of new drivers and features are developed in a different git repository than rolled up as one large commit. And one would expect the initial integration commit to be tagged for most bugs initially.<br>
Despite the efforts of developers, bugs start showing up as soon as the new driver gets exposure.<br>

When I invented the Fixes tag, I had articles like this in mind.  *unhumble brag*.<br>

The networking subsystem started enforcing a policy that Fixes had to have tags earlier than other subsystems so perhaps that's why they have more.<br>

This also misses the correction to the codebase. But in any case, looking at the graph, I would rather tell, that this is neverending story: bugs are still there, just harder to be asserted (thanks to syzbot to help with that) and to fix. I would take the curve till v4.14 as an approximation for the extrapolation in time for the newer versions.<br>

Linux 4.14 was released roughly five years ago. While the decline from 5.8 on is likely due to not enough time since the release, it seems unlikely that there are so many bugs left to find that are more than five years old.<br>

Not all patches that have Fixed tag in commit messages are fixes for practical issues that bother users.<br>
<p>
Would be interesting to see stats from bugzilla.kernel.org , how many bugs are open there for particular kernel version, how many get closed , how much time on average take to close the bug, etc. At least for subsystems that use bugzilla for bug tracking. <br>

      (... catching up...)

<blockquote>
One interesting exception
</blockquote>
Both these exceptions are making a change and then doing the same mechanical transformation to a lot of different places as fallout, each as a separate commit -- but they're all conceptually the same thing and are likely separate commits just because they touch different subsystems and thus go in via different routes. So really these two exceptions required either a single fix, or none (because the original commit wasn't actually <i>buggy</i> as such: it just needed changes to other subsystems as well, and used Fixes: to denote that the original commit wouldn't work properly until these other commits were in too).
<p>
(As someone busy doing that sort of thing right now, I'm avoiding this problem by putting in the massive multi-subsystem series <i>before</i> I introduce the commits that rely on it. This is usually a better ordering, but not if that 'relying commit' is fixing a live bug that likely bites everyone and the multi-subsystem fixes that follow are fixing cases that bite fewer people.)

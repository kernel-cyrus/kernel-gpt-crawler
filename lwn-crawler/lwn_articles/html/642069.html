<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 29, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel development community maintains a strong commitment to ABI
compatibility; as a general rule, changes that will break existing
applications are not allowed.  But the community is also committed to
fixing known security problems.  There are times when a security issue
cannot be fixed without changing the way a user-visible interface works,
and that can lead to problems.  One such situation has come up as the
result of a change merged for the 4.0 kernel.
<p>
Back in 2008, the 2.6.25 kernel included <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/85863e475e59afb027b0113290e3796ee6020b7d">a
patch</a> adding a new virtual file (called <tt>pagemap</tt>) to each
process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory.  That file contains an array of 64-bit
values describing each page in the process's virtual address space.  If the
page is currently resident, the physical page-frame number will be given;
otherwise, information on how to find the page in swap is provided.  The
original purpose for the <tt>pagemap</tt> file was to enable investigations
into which pages were resident and which were shared with other processes.
<a href="/Articles/642072/">Documentation/vm/pagemap.txt</a> has
information on what can be found in this file.
<p>
At the time this patch was merged, there appeared to be no harm in exposing
the physical page-frame information.  Since then, though, sentiments have
turned against disclosing internal kernel information that is not strictly
needed by user space.  That, alone, might have eventually inspired somebody
to remove the page-frame number from the <tt>pagemap</tt> file but, as it
happens, something else came along first.
<p>
That something is the "<a
href="http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html">rowhammer
vulnerability</a>," wherein the contents of a memory area can be changed by
repeatedly hammering on a nearby memory area.  If an attacker wanted to use
this technique to compromise a system, the first order of business would be
to obtain access to a page of memory physically adjacent to the memory that
is targeted to be changed.  The contents of the <tt>pagemap</tt> file, by
providing the physical location of every page mapped in the system, would
obviously be most helpful in such a situation.  There will probably be
other ways for an attacker to determine how pages are laid out in physical
memory, but <tt>pagemap</tt> is almost certainly the easiest way.
<p>
To make life harder for attackers attempting to exploit the rowhammer
vulnerability, <a href="/Articles/642074/">a simple patch</a> was merged
for the 4.0-rc5 release in March.  The patch turned the
<tt>pagemap</tt> file into a privileged interface; attempts to open it will
now fail unless the process in question has the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>
capability.  The 4.0 release came out with that restriction in place, and
everybody who was paying attention slept a little easier.
<p>
But that rest appears to have come at the cost of some
sleepless nights elsewhere.  It turns out that <a
href="/Articles/642075/">the UndoDB debugger uses the <tt>pagemap</tt>
file</a> to track changes to memory.  When changes need to be tracked, the
debugger will <tt>fork()</tt> the process, putting all of its writable
memory into copy-on-write mode.  After running the operation of interest (a
system call, normally), the debugger can scan the <tt>pagemap</tt> file to
see which pages have changed page-frame numbers; those are the pages that
were written to, and, thus, copied.  Without access to <tt>pagemap</tt>,
UndoDB cannot get this information and, as a result, it no longer works.
<p>
In some situations of this type, one might just argue that the tool in
question should be run as root.  But that is not generally a desirable way
to run an interactive debugging tool.  So some other sort of solution must
be found, or UndoDB will remain broken.  There are cases where "remains
broken" may be the final outcome; as Linus <a
href="/Articles/642077/">said</a> in response to the report, "<q>the one
exception to the regression rule is 'security fixes'</q>".  But,
fortunately, there appear to be some better options available this time
around.
<p>
One possibility would be to restore access to the <tt>pagemap</tt> file but
to somehow scramble the page-frame numbers before reporting them to user
space.  That would work for UndoDB, since it doesn't care about the actual
page-frame numbers; it is only looking for changes.  Linus was not
convinced that this was the right way to go, though: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	However, I don't believe that we have a good enough scrambling
	model to make that reasonable. Remember: any attacker will be able
	to see our scrambling code, so it would need to be both
	cryptographically secure *and* use a truly random per-VM secret
	key. Quite frankly, that's a _lot_ of effort for dubious gain...
</div>
<p>
Andy Lutomirski also <a href="/Articles/642078/">pointed out</a> that even
scrambled page-frame numbers might be enough for an attacker to obtain some
memory-adjacency information.  So that approach does not appear to be
viable.
<p>
The alternative is to simply report the page-frame numbers as zero in the
absence of <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.  That would make the rest of the
information in <tt>pagemap</tt> available while not exposing the page-frame
information.  The bad news is that always-zero page-frame numbers are not
helpful for UndoDB.  The good news, though, is that there is something else
in <tt>pagemap</tt> that is just as useful.
<p>
That "something else" is the "soft-dirty" mechanism added to the 3.11
kernel in support of the <a
href="http://criu.org/Main_Page">checkpoint-restore in user space
(CRIU)</a> effort.  Along with the
page-frame number,
each <tt>pagemap</tt> entry contains a soft-dirty bit that is meant to
track pages that have 
been written to.  All of the soft-dirty bits for a process can be reset to
zero by writing to the <tt>clear_refs</tt> 
file in that process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory.  Thereafter, the soft-dirty
bit will be set whenever that process writes to a given page.  CRIU uses
this mechanism to find pages that have been changed during the checkpoint
process, but it also will work for the UndoDB case.  (See <a
href="/Articles/642080/">Documentation/vm/soft-dirty.txt</a> for details on
the soft-dirty mechanism).
<p>
So the probable outcome in this case is that <tt>pagemap</tt> will, once
again, become globally readable.  But it will contain no useful page-frame
numbers unless the reading process had <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> when it
opened the file.  That will make UndoDB users happy again while preserving
the security objectives of the original patch.  So this story has a happy
ending â€” unless, of course, another user who truly needs the page-frame
number information steps forward.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hello all - I sent the e-mail about UndoDB that originally kicked off this discussion.  I'm not speaking for my company, as such, but here's my perspective as a developer who's involved...<br>
<p>
It's been an interesting week investigating this!  As you might imagine, it was a bit of a surprise to find we had problems with newer kernels, though of course the quick response by the kernel folks to mitigate Row Hammer was quite appropriate and understandable.<br>
<p>
UndoDB has the option of running in a less efficient mode on pre-pagemap systems, so with very minor tweaks we'll be falling back to that when running on kernels that have restricted pagemap permissions; it doesn't break us completely.  However, the current situation prevents us from running in our most efficient mode of operation.  It's been great to have such a productive discussion on LKML about the pagemap functionality - it feels like we're now maybe converging on an acceptable solution that will give us just enough information to run with all our optimisations enabled.<br>
<p>
A happy result of the whole situation is that we've learned about soft-dirty mode, which looks very useful.  This has proved not to be as complete a fix as we'd hoped (it's not available on some of the very old kernels we support, nor on i686 or ARM) so we're still investigating how to deal with its absence.  Still, where it's present it should be *really* useful.<br>
<p>
Another lesson we've taken from this is that, as rather advanced users of the kernel-userspace interfaces, we should probably be doing regular testing with kernels compiled with Linus's git.  Hopefully if anything similar happens in future we will be able to provide proactive feedback to LKML, which should be better for everyone concerned.<br>

IMHO this is very sad.<br>
<p>
On one side we have very dubious _hardware_ bug that can be potentially used as vulnerability. And on the other side we have ABI-breakage that actually breaks product of people's hard work.<br>
<p>
There are also likely other means to get physically contiguous pages. I.e. via huge pages or 1 gig pages. Also it's quite possible that on freshly booted system kernel already hands pages to processes in reasonably predictable way.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm missing something but, I can't see how rowhammer can be good reason for breaking people's code.<br>
<p>
Also soft-dirty is nice, but sadly it can't be used by more than single entity at same time. I.e. if CRIU is using it, then it cannot be used for e.g. boehm gc for efficient tracking of mutations for generational GC and it cannot be used by UndoDB. I know it's a bit unrelated and it's likely that something more powerful and generic would be too inefficient, but it still adds to my sadness :(<br>
<p>
P.S. I don't work for UndoDB. I just find this situation sad and unjust.<br>

Fortunately, from our PoV, whilst the change breaks our preferred operating mode we can use our fallback on the kernels that have this behaviour.  If our patching work is accepted then hopefully it won't present overly widespread problems for us.<br>
<p>
In terms of rowhammer, it's an interesting point about hugepages - presumably as there aren't as many of them you're much more likely to get one that's contiguous with something you'd like to meddle with.<br>
<p>
More generally, my understanding is that hiding PFNs is explicitly intended as an obstacle to slow attackers rather than an outright fix.  I can also see the argument that exposing PFNs in the first place was probably not the best plan, in hindsight...<br>

I think 'has actually been used as a vulnerability' would be a better way of putting this, given that exploits have been demonstrated, and that the physical pfn info provided by pagemap is essential to escalate this from a DoS that crashes things at random to an exploit that lets you futz with the guts of the kernel to such an extent that you can execute arbitrary code in kernel space.

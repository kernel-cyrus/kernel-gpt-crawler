Hardening the Linux kernel is an endless task, with work required on
multiple fronts.  Sometimes, that work is not done in the kernel itself;
other tools, including compilers, can have a significant role to play. 
At the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2023">2023 GNU Tools
Cauldron</a>, Qing Zhao covered some of the work that has been done in the
GCC compiler to help with the hardening of the kernel — along with work
that still needs to be done.
<p>
The <a
href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project">Kernel
self-protection project</a> is the home for much of the kernel-hardening
work, she began.  Hardening can be done in a number of ways, starting with
the fixing of known security bugs, which may be found by static checkers,
fuzzers, or code inspection.  Fixing bugs is a never-ending task, though;
it is far better, when possible, to eliminate whole classes of bugs
entirely.  Thus, much of the work in the kernel has focused on getting rid
of problems like stack and heap overflows, integer overflows, format-string
injection, pointer leaks, use of uninitialized variables, use-after-free
bugs, and more.  Effort is also going into blocking methods of
exploitation, including the ability to overwrite kernel text or function
pointers.
<p>

The GCC 11 release (April 2021), she said, included the ability to zero the
registers used by a function on return from that function; that can help
prevent the leakage of information.  It is now on by default.  GCC&nbsp;12
(May 2022), instead, added the automatic initialization of stack variables;
that, too, has been turned on by default in kernel builds.  GCC&nbsp;13
(April 2023) added more strict treatment of flexible-array members.
<p>
Zhao briefly mentioned some of the features that the kernel
community would like to see in future compiler releases.  These include
better support for flexible-array checking, a reduction in false-positive
warnings with the <tt>&#8209;warray&#8209;bounds</tt> option, better integer-overflow
checking, support for control-flow integrity checking, and more.
<p>
Returning to flexible arrays, Zhao pointed out that out-of-bounds array
accesses are a major source of vulnerabilities in the kernel.  These can be
prevented by bounds checking — if the size of the array in question is
known.  For fixed arrays, the size is known at compile time, so the
checking of array accesses can be done, either at compile time (if
possible) or at run time.  For dynamically sized arrays, though, the
problem is harder.  In C, these arrays take two forms: variable-length
arrays and flexible-array members in structures; only the latter are used
in the kernel at this point.
<p>
A flexible-array member is an array embedded within a structure as the
final element.  It is often declared as having a dimension of either zero
or one (though the latter tends to be a frequent source of bugs), or just
as <tt>array[]</tt>.  When space for an instance of the structure is
allocated, it must be sized large enough to hold the actual array, which
will vary in length from one instance to the next.
<p>
In GCC 12, all arrays that are defined as the final member of a structure
are considered to be flexible, regardless of the declared size of the
array.  So even the array here:
<p>
<pre>
    struct foo {
        int int_field;
	int array[10];
    };
</pre>
<p>
would be deemed by the compiler to be flexible in size even though that was
(probably) not the developer's intent; as a result, no
bounds checking is performed on accesses to those arrays.  In GCC&nbsp;13,
the <tt>&#8209;fstrict&#8209;flex&#8209;arrays</tt> option gives control
over which arrays are considered to be flexible arrays; <a
href="/Articles/908817/">this article</a> gives an overview of how it
works.  The result is that bounds checking can be more easily applied to
arrays that were never meant to vary in size.
<p>
There are still some problems, though; Zhao mentioned the case of a
structure containing a flexible-array member that is, in turn, nested into
another structure type:
<p>
<pre>
    struct s1 {
        int flex_array[0];
    };

    struct s2 {
	type_t some_field;
	struct s1 flex_struct;
    }
</pre>
<p>

Even if the flexible structure is the final member of the containing
structure (<tt>s2</tt> above), versions of GCC less than&nbsp;14 will
incorrectly treat the array as fixed.  Zhao has contributed a fix for that
particular problem.  A separate problem arises when the flexible structure
is <i>not</i> the final field of the containing structure.  In this case,
it's not clear what the compiler should do, but GCC has accepted such
structures.  The new <tt>&#8209;Wflex&#8209;array&#8209;member&#8209;not&#8209;at&#8209;end</tt> option will
warn about such code.
<p>
Flexible-array members in unions are yet another problem; GCC will accept
such members when declared as <tt>array[0]</tt>, but the (legal)
<tt>array[]</tt> form is not accepted.  That makes it impossible to create
unions that will compile under the strictest <tt>&#8209;fstrict&#8209;flex&#8209;array</tt>
mode.  Unions containing <i>only</i> flexible array members raise a
different issue: they could end up being a zero-length object, which is not
something the C&nbsp;standard allows.  Adding a fixed-length member
resolves that issue for now; there may be an attempt to allow fully
flexible unions as a future GCC extension.
<p>
Use of flexible arrays currently defeats bounds checking, but the actual
length of any given array is (or at least should be) known to the code as
it is running.  If that size can be communicated to the compiler, bounds
checking can be added.  There are two potential ways of declaring that
information; one would be to add a new syntax to embed it within the type
itself:
<p>
<pre>
    struct foo {
        size_t len;
	char array[.len*4];
    };
</pre>
<p>
This syntax allows the use of expressions (in this case, "four times
the value of the <tt>len</tt> field").  It is the cleaner option, she said,
but it has the potential to break ABIs for existing code by changing the
dimension of the array.  That makes it harder to adopt, as does the syntax
change, which is sure to require a lot of discussion before it would find
acceptance.
<p>
An alternative is to add an attribute to the flexible-array member instead.
That preserves the existing ABI, is easier to adopt, and can also be
extended to other types (pointers, for example).  On the other hand, it is
harder to extend to more complex expressions.  The <a
href="/Articles/936728/"><tt>counted_by()</tt> attribute</a> has been added
for GCC&nbsp;14 without expression support; it can only refer to
another field in the same structure for now.
<p>
<pre>
    struct foo {
        size_t len;
	char array[] __counted_by(len);
    };
</pre>
<p>
In this case, the <tt>len</tt> field can only be used to dimension
<tt>array</tt> directly, no expressions allowed.
This attribute only works for the size of the flexible array itself for
now; future work may get it to the point where, for example, it can warn
when the allocation size for the structure is not sufficient to hold the
array.
<p>
There is some talk of extending this checking to pointer values as well;
Apple has <a
href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-enforcing-bounds-safety-in-c-fbounds-safety/70854">a
proposal</a> for a more elaborate <tt>&#8209;fbounds&#8209;safety</tt> flag
(for LLVM) implementing this idea.  It is a superset of the existing
<tt>counted_by()</tt> behavior; it would be more effort to implement and
adopt, but will be considered later if it takes off.
<p>
Bounds checking is only useful if the checks are correct, so the existence
of false-positive warnings is a problem.  Specifically, code that is
optimized with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_threading">jump
threading</a> can create false positives.  One aspect of this problem has
been fixed in GCC&nbsp;13, while another is still open.  This issue is
preventing <tt>&#8209;Warray&#8209;bounds</tt> from being enabled by
default in kernel builds.  There are some ideas circulating for how to mark
code where jump threading has been used and suppress the resulting
warnings.
<p>
A separate issue entirely is integer-overflow detection.  In the C
standard, overflow is defined for unsigned integer values, but undefined
for signed values and pointers.  For the undefined case, GCC provides
options to either define the expected behavior or to detect the overflow.
There is no option, though, for unsigned overflow, since the behavior is
well defined.  But unsigned overflow is often unintentional and would be
good to detect.  Perhaps, she said, there needs to be a new option to allow
for detection in this case.
<p>
Back to signed overflow, she noted that the <tt>&#8209;fwrapv</tt> option makes
the behavior defined; the variable will wrap around when it overflows.
But, while the kernel needs to have overflows trap most of the time, there
are occasional spots where it should be allowed.  Florian Weimer pointed
out that there is a built-in mechanism now that can be used to disable
checking for specific operations; Zhao said that she would look into it.
<p>
At this point time ran out, and Zhao was unable to get into the discussion
of control-flow integrity options.  The picture that came out of the
session was clear, though.  Quite a bit of work has gone into improving GCC
so that it can help in the hardening of the kernel (and other programs too,
of course).  But, like so many other jobs, the task of defending the kernel
against attackers never seems to end.  There will be plenty for developers,
on both the compiler and kernel sides, to do for the foreseeable future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As far as I can tell this hasn't yet been merged into gcc - at least I don't find it the sources, docs, nor has the gcc issue been closed / updated: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla//show_bug.cgi?id=108896">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla//show_bug.cgi?id=108896</a> and the mailing list discussion I found didn't indicate the patch having been committed either.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 18, 2011</br>
           </div>
Your editor was innocently looking at some papers on his desk the other day
when his computer abruptly decided to suspend itself.  Rawhide is fun in
that way; combined with GNOME's delight in forgetting user settings, it can
produce no end of surprises to brighten one's working experience.  The
ability to suspend a desktop system to RAM is actually quite a nice
feature, but your editor prefers to have a say in when it happens.
Thankfully, GNOME still (so far) allows automatic suspend to be turned
off.  But it is clear that the suspend-to-RAM functionality is seeing
increased use in a number of contexts; it is not just for laptops and
Android anymore.  Your editor's desktop is not the only place where
stakeholders want some control over when the system sleeps and when it
needs to stay running.

<p>
Indeed, control over automatic suspension of the system is at the core of the
debate over Android's opportunistic suspend mechanism.  As usage of
suspend-to-RAM increases, so does interest in creating a proper mechanism
for determining when a suspend can happen.  <a href="/Articles/463336/">A
new patch set</a> from Rafael 
Wysocki has restarted this discussion and led to, possibly, a surprising
conclusion.
<p>
Rafael started with the conclusion that "<q>whatever the kernel has to
offer in this area is either too complicated to use in practice or
inadequate for other reasons</q>".  He then went on to propose a new
mechanism that, he hoped, would simplify things.  It came in two parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A new sysfs knob, <tt>/sys/power/sleep_mode</tt>, which provided
     overall control of the suspend-to-RAM and hibernation functionality.
     If a suitably-privileged process writes "<tt>disabled</tt>" to this
     file, no attempt to suspend or hibernate the system will succeed.  It
     is a sort of high-power wakelock that ensures the system will keep
     running while important work is being done.
<p>
<li> Applications wanting to keep the system awake would open a new device,
     <tt>/dev/sleepctl</tt>, and execute an <tt>ioctl()</tt> to that
     effect.  After this call, attempts to suspend the system would block
     until the application explicitly drops its lock or until a 500ms (by
     default) timeout period expires.  The "stay awake" operation would
     also be done by the system at resume time to give processes time to
     perform whatever tasks need to be done.
</ul>
<p>
It is probably safe to say that these patches will not be merged in
anything resembling this form.  Leading the opposition was Neil Brown, who
<a href="/Articles/463530/">asserted</a> that the job could be done in user
space, and, indeed, should be done that way.  According to Neil:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The only sane way to handle suspend is for any (suitably
	privileged) process to be able to request that suspend doesn't
	happen, and then for one process to initiate suspend when no-one is
	blocking it.
</div>
<p>
Communication with that process, Neil claimed, should be no harder than
using Rafael's simplified interface to communicate with the kernel.
After a fair amount of discussion, Neil came up with <a
href="/Articles/463510/">a proposal</a> for how he thinks things should
actually work.  As one would expect from the above quote, it centers around
a single daemon with the responsibility for suspending and resuming the
system.  A decision to suspend the system is never made by the kernel, and,
if everybody is following the rules, by no other user-space process.
<p>
The daemon has a pair of modes; it starts in the "on demand" mode where the
system will only be suspended after an explicit request to do so.  That
request could come from the user closing the lid or pressing a button
sequence; in this case, the system should suspend in short order regardless
of what is happening, and it should not resume without an explicit user
action.  Suspend can also be requested by a suitably-privileged
application; in this case the operation is only carried out if nothing is
blocking it, and the system can be automatically resumed at some future
time.  This mode was also referred to as the "legacy" mode; it needs to be
supported but it is not how things are expected to run most of the time.

<p>
Other processes in the system can affect suspend behavior by talking to the
daemon.  One of the things a sufficiently-privileged process can do is to
ask the daemon to go into "immediate" mode; in that mode, the system will
suspend anytime there is no known reason to stay awake.  The immediate
mode, thus, closely mirrors the opportunistic suspend mechanism used on
Android systems.  When the daemon is in immediate mode, it no longer makes
sense for any process in the system to ask the system to suspend - the
daemon is already prepared to suspend whenever the opportunity arises.  So
the rest of the interface is concerned with when the system should be
awake.
<p>
Any process with an interest in suspend and resume events can open a socket
to the daemon and request notification anytime a suspend is being
contemplated.  That process should respond to such notifications with a message saying that
it is ready for the suspend to happen; it can, optionally, add a request
that the system stay awake for the time being if there is work that must be
done.  If no processes block the suspend, the system will go to sleep;
another message will be sent to all processes once the system resumes.
<p>
There is an interesting variant on this mechanism whereby processes can
register one or more file descriptors with the daemon.  In this case, the
daemon will only query the associated processes before suspending if one or
more of the given file descriptors is reported as readable by
<tt>poll()</tt>.  A readable file descriptor thus functions in a manner
similar to a driver-acquired wakelock in the Android system.  If a device
wakes the system and provides input for a user-space process to read, the
daemon will see that the file descriptor is readable and avoid suspending
the system until that input has been consumed and acted upon.  Meanwhile,
processes that clearly have no need to block suspend will not need to wake
up and respond to a notification every time a suspend is contemplated.

<p>
The daemon also allows processes to request that the system be awake at
some future time.  A tool like <tt>cron</tt> can use this feature to, say,
wake the system late at night to run a backup.
<p>
At a first glance, this approach looks like it should be able to handle the
opportunistic suspend problem without the need to add more mechanism to the
kernel.  But it must be remembered that this is a problem that has defeated
a number of initially reasonable-looking solutions.  Whether this proposal
will fare better - and whether the various desktop and mobile environments
will adopt it - remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Not sure if this is useful for smartphones/Android, but I definitely want a "suspend policy" daemon on my desktop and laptop computers.<br>
<p>
Session managers already do something similar for screen savers (though that's in user's session scope, not global). Also desktop environment developers have introduced lots of new odd daemons recently, I'm surprised they haven't came up with a suspend policy framework yet.<br>
<p>
I've currently set all my computers to suspend after 1 hour of inactivity which works great, but I'd like to block suspend when I'm just using my computer to play music and not otherwise using the computer. Also, I want to suspend my laptop, but not when I have music playing. This seems impossible to do for now and makes opportunistic suspend quite annoying. Also I don't want my laptop suspending when I'm listening to music and just close the lid. I just want the screen to shut off its backlight.<br>
<p>
So music players could come with a checkbox "[x] Block suspend while playing music" and my BitTorrent client could have "[x] Block suspend until downloads have completed"<br>
<p>
Combined with wake-on-LAN, I see this could even be useful for home servers (e.g. NAS) to save power while everyone is asleep.<br>

Apple's Wifi routers and their desktops have a feature called wake-on-demand, that will send the requisite wake-on-lan packet to a sleeping machine when a bonjour published service is accessed. So, in theory your system could sleep until you want to ssh into it, and then the router, detecting the attempted access to the sleeping system, sends then wake on lan packet to the system allowing your ssh connection to proceed. Sadly this feature has been an Apple only thing, and while Apple has the source for it's implementation available (it's deeply tied into Darwin's packet filtering),  it hasn't gotten any real attention in the Openwrt and related communities. <br>

The PowerNap project/package in Ubuntu provides exactly the kind of policy manager you're talking about.  It was designed to be sort of a "screensaver for servers, except saving power instead of the screen", but it works just as well on desktop and laptops.  I know LWN and its readers love to hate Ubuntu/Canonical/Launchpad, but in case you're curious, see: <a href="http://launchpad.net/powernap">http://launchpad.net/powernap</a>.<br>

Okay, Jake, you're right -- my comment was inappropriate.  I was in a bit of bad mood when I wrote that.  My apologies.<br>

Anyway, a friend linked me to this interesting article about opportunistic suspend and suggested that I link PowerNap in as a pertinent tool.  I should have did just that and left the criticism to others.  Sorry.<br>

There is some commentary about that package and the dubious value of how good it actually is.  Since we're not seeing enough inflammatory comments about Canonical/Ubuntu/Launchpad on the frontpage, I'll have to post a link here below:<br>

If your computer/tablet/phone can play music while suspended (probably some ARM devices can do this) then your preferences would mean extra power use.<br>

Equally, they would avoid trashed files ...<br>
<p>
I had a load of audacity projects on my Linpus Aspire and did an mv to move them to my desktop.<br>
<p>
With hindsight leaving the Aspire on the desk to finish copying was a major mistake - it kept suspending, breaking network links, and I ended up having to repeatedly wake it. What's worse, it didn't move stuff properly, and having started working on those projects on the desktop, I discovered a load of files had been trashed, leaving holes in the audio. Seeing as I'd done an mv, not a cp, recovery was not possible ... :-(<br>
<p>
Suspending at the wrong time will trash your data ...<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

This is a problem with opportunistic suspend. This is a bug in the protocol/file system you used to access the remote machine. A proper one would return the network error back to mv as an I/O error, and mv would abort without deleting the source file.<br>

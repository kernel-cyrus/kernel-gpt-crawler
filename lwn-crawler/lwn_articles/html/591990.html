</div>
While opinions on how the kernel should respond to out-of-memory (OOM)
situations vary, almost everybody seems to agree that what the kernel does
now is in need of improvement.  A session on the topic during the memory
management track at the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory
Management Summit covered some possible improvements, but reached no real
conclusions.
<p>
David Rientjes used the session to talk about his user-space OOM handling
patches and to ask for a green light for their inclusion.  He spent a while
talking about how these patches work; this introduction can be found in <a
href="/Articles/590960/">David's article on the subject</a> and will not be

repeated here.  David has been pushing this work for the last year or so,
but it seems clear that the community is still not completely sold on it.
<p>
Sasha Levin asked whether it might be better to use the <a
href="/Articles/524742/">vmpressure</a> 
mechanism, which sends notifications when memory is getting tight, rather
than waiting for a full OOM situation and hoping that user space can handle
it.  The problem with that approach, as Rik van Riel put it, is that there
is no limit to how quickly a system can consume its memory.  David added
that the vmpressure mechanism does not work as well as one might think.  As
an illustration of the problem, consider a process that locks many pages
into memory; 
it will consume much of the available memory, but no pressure
notifications will result because no reclaim is yet happening.  The system
can then go from a "no pressure" 
state to "out of memory" almost instantaneously once reclaim starts; there
simply is no opportunity for user space to respond.
<p>
As the discussion went on, it became clear that the most discomfort existed
around the use of a user-space handler to deal with global OOM situations.
If a single control group under the memory controller (a "memcg") runs out
of memory, it makes sense to have a user-space handler respond.  But,
Michal Hocko asked, do we really want to handle global OOM situations
(where the system as a whole is out of memory) in user space?  He agreed
that the current code does not work for everybody, but, he said, pushing
responsibility into user space opens up a can of worms and would be hard to
maintain in the long term.  It would be better, he suggested, to improve
the global OOM killer in the kernel instead.
<p>
Tim Hockin, speaking about his work at Google (which has driven the
user-space OOM handler development), talked about the problems they have
had with OOM-handling requirements that have changed over time.  Google has
a hard time deciding what it wants to have happen in OOM situations; it
seems hard to expect the kernel developers to anticipate where those
requirements might go in the future.  That has led to the desire to push
the policy into user space where it can be changed without the need to
build and deploy a new kernel — a process which does not happen quickly at
Google.  He would be happy with an in-kernel mechanism that allowed
policies to be changed, but only if it is possible to effect a change
without building a new kernel.
<p>
Robert Haas agreed that moving the policy into user space gives users the
ability to make changes without having to change the kernel itself.  Kernel
developers, he said, simply are not smart 
enough to come up with all possible policies.  But David said he was
willing to try if that was how it would be done, though he suggested that
the community might not be happy about the "hundreds of patches"
implementing all of the possible policies that would result.
<p>
There was also some unhappiness about David's use of the memcg mechanism
for global OOM handling.  That mechanism will only work if control groups
are built into the kernel, but there are still plenty of users who prefer
not to enable control groups at all.  The
motivation for using that interface was to allow per-memcg and global OOM
handlers to work with the same interface and be coded the same way.  Peter
Zijlstra suggested that the same control files could be placed in
<tt>/proc</tt> for global OOM handling, providing something very close to
the same interface without needing to enable control groups.
<p>
David asked for some guidance on how he could make progress in this area.
It has been hard to get a consensus on his user-space OOM handling patches,
but no viable alternatives have come forward.  So he is somewhat stuck.
Unfortunately, no consensus emerged in this session either, so there is
still no clear path forward for this project.

Have there been any recent attempts at eliminating overcommit? <br>
<p>
There was a post a while ago[1] by a Windows kernel developer commenting on the lack of advances in the NT kernel and he mentioned that the Linux OOM situation was just crazy.<br>
<p>
I remember Alan Cox having some patches to eliminate overcommit a long time ago. Any other efforts? It seems so much time is spent on handling OOM instead of solving this once and for all.<br>

      Eliminating overcommit does not eliminate the need for an OOM mechanism more sophisticated than "ENOMEM all allocations when memory is exhausted", because that mechanism iteratively kills random programs whose authors are not professional paranoids who always make a massive alloca()-and-memset() to ensure they will have enough stack space for all non-pathological cases, rather than killing the runaway process that is hoovering up all of RAM and swap into its heap.

      It's been possible to turn off overcommit for a long long time; see /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.  But few people do that because it's actually a real pain to have to provide every bit of memory that every process thinks it might ever use.

Wouldn't that be a case of "we need to fix userpace" like with the power problems that led to the creation of powertop? It should be easy to create a memorytop program to list the big offenders in allocated but never used memory.<br>

      <p>That sounds good on paper. Unfortunately, one of the sources of "big offenders" is the result of the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emacs / Firefox / Kdenlive / Eclipse / GIMP / (your favorite application software with a large writable working set) calls <tt>fork()</tt>.</li>
<li>Child process touches a very small subset of its copy of the working set, in order to perform some set of operations which for whatever reason cannot be encoded as arguments to <tt>posix_spawn()</tt> (and anyway you can't rely on <tt>posix_spawn()</tt> being implemented as a syscall).</li>
<li>Child process calls <tt>execve()</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a rather less tractable problem than "this, that, and the other program are spending lots of time busywaiting and thus preventing the CPU from going into a C-state".</p>

... and anyway nobody ever uses posix_spawn() unless they have to because it's a horror to do anything in it. It's meant for programs that have to run on MMU-less systems that are so primitive that they cannot implement any sort of fork(), and such systems rarely run big fork-happy text editors!<br>

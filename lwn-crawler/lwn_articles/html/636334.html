One of the drivers of memory-management development is scalability —
performing well on ever-larger systems.  So it is not surprising that
scalability is a perennial discussion topic at kernel development
gatherings; the 2015 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management
Summit was no exception.  Andi Kleen and Peter Zijlstra led the first of
two  sessions on
virtual memory scalability during the memory-management track at that
event.
<p>
Andi started by pointing out that systems were growing, not only in the
number of CPU cores available, but also in the amount of attached memory.
The number of cores per NUMA node is on the rise, which is bringing out
some new scalability problems.
<p>

One of the well-used scalability tactics found in the kernel is per-CPU
variables; when each CPU has its own data, there can be no contention
between them.  But, Andi asserted, as the number of CPUs grows, it no
longer makes

<a href="/Articles/636538/"><img

align="left"></a> 

sense to do things on a per-CPU basis.  It just adds a lot of work whenever
it becomes necessary to touch every CPU's version of a variable.  Instead,
data should be made local to groups of N cores (where N was not specified).
<p>
Christoph Lameter said that a lot of these scaling problems can be
addressed by limiting subsystems to specific cores.  Andi replied that this
approach works great at installations where there is an experienced person
configuring the system.  In the absence of that person, it does not work
quite so well.
<p>
Mel Gorman asked the group what other scalability problems are being
experienced now.  Christoph complained about I/O bandwidth; in particular,
he said, he is unable to push more than about 2GB/second to a filesystem.
The problems come down to locking and the handling of 4KB pages in the XFS
filesystem.  Writeback tends to slow things down, since a lot of CPU time
is spent making it happen.
<p>
That led to a discussion of batching operations — another tried-and-true
scalability technique.  It was noted that the reverse-mapping code, which
maintains data structures to enable the kernel to tell which processes
have references to a given physical page, takes its locks on a per-page
basis.  Fixing that, evidently, is not hard, but it will require some
reorganization of the code.
<p>
The current least-recently-used (LRU) lists track memory in units of 4KB
pages.  That is considered at this point to be overly fine-grained; there
is no need for LRU accuracy at that level.  There was talk of implementing
a "bucket LRU" that would track larger groups of pages.
<p>
Inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) for translation lookaside buffer flushes
have long been seen as a potential scalability problem.  But, it seems

<a href="/Articles/636539/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lsfmm/PeterZijlstra-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Peter Zijlstra]" title="Peter Zijlstra" hspace=3 vspace=2 border=0
align="left"></a> 

that, while people worry about IPIs, it is hard to find a workload where
they create a bottleneck.  Usually the much-maligned <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
semaphore gets in the way first.
<p>
There was some vague talk of other scalability issues; memory compaction
was mentioned as a problem on large systems.  If compaction tries to
migrate a lot of pages, that can lead to large latencies in process
execution.  Mel Gorman said that compaction shouldn't be doing that,
though, so it is not clear where the problem is.
<p>
The session wound down without coming to any real conclusions.  The
scalability topic returned on the second day, though, when Davidlohr Bueso
led a session focused on <tt>mmap_sem</tt> in particular.  This semaphore
controls access to a process's page tables, along with a number of other,
not always well-defined things; it has been on the list of things to fix
for some time now.  Davidlohr stated a wish to walk out with some tangible
action items for improving the situation.
<p>
He started by looking back at past action items, especially those that came
out of the <a href="/Articles/591978/">LSFMM 2014 locking session</a>.  One
of the concerns then was use of <tt>mmap_sem</tt> in drivers and other code
outside of the memory-management subsystem.  Jan Kara has been working on
getting drivers to use the <tt>gup_fast()</tt> variant of
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> in order to eliminate dependencies on
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>; the biggest problem he is facing at the moment is a
deadlock problem in the media subsystem.
<p>
Jan would also like to get <tt>mmap_sem</tt> out of the filesystem code.
Al Viro wondered, though, about how virtual memory area (VMA) structures
would be protected in its absence.  Peter said he has a patch that shifts
the protection of VMAs to <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable RCU</a> if
anybody wanted to push that work forward.

Meanwhile, Jan hopes to get his driver patches submitted soon.
<p>
Davidlohr said that his focus is moving stuff out from under
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> entirely and, eventually, breaking up the lock into
something finer-grained.  The problem with that, as Peter pointed out, is

<a href="/Articles/636540/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lsfmm/DavidlohrBueso-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Davidlohr Bueso]" title="Davidlohr Bueso" hspace=3 vspace=2 border=0
align="right"></a> 

that what's protected by the lock now is not entirely clear.  The way to
start, he 
said, would be to document what's protected by <tt>mmap_sem</tt>; after
that, one can start thinking about better locking schemes.
<p>
One problem with <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is that it protects a process's entire
address space.  Concurrency could be increased by locking only portions of
that space instead.  The concept of "range locks" is thus of interest
here.  Michal Hocko suggested that developers could start by replacing
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> with a range lock that still covers the entire address
space; the locking could then be made more precise in an incremental
manner.
<p>
Hugh Dickins, though, wondered if that was the right approach and what
problems, exactly, were being solved with range locks.  His impression was
that the top priority was to get page-fault handling out from under
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> entirely.  The answer was that there are, in fact, two
different issues to be addressed regarding <tt>mmap_sem</tt>: it protects
too much, and the hold times are too long.  Range locks are one attempt to
address the first part of the problem.  Peter added that, among other
things, range locking would allow concurrent <tt>mmap()</tt> calls to
proceed, which is important for some threaded workloads.
<p>
There was some concern about surprises that can pop up when it turns out
that an unexpected 
corner of the code was relying on <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  In extreme cases,
Hugh said, user-space code may even rely on it.  He described a complaint
from a user about a change in <tt>mlock()</tt> semantics.  Changes in the
kernel increased <tt>mlock()</tt> concurrency and, in the process, exposed
a lack of locking on the user-space side.  Sympathy for the affected user
was relatively low in this case, but, Hugh said, it would be wise to be
prepared for nasty surprises.
<p>
In the end, Davidlohr's desire for tangible action items went mostly
unfulfilled.  About the only firm conclusion was that the range-lock code
will be cleaned up and posted in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Unfortunately I missed the second day of this topic (mmap_sem) since I was filesystem track about epoll.<br>
<p>
I'd love to see something done around mmap_sem, there was one workload we had with a fairly heavyweight process to churn through columnar db data for aggregation. It used mmap for the columnar files (for zero copy) with 16 threads mmap_sem started showing up a non-negligible part when we spent some time looking into getting more performance using perf.<br>
<p>
Happy to hear that there's work ongoing on this.<br>

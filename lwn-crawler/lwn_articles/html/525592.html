Inserting a loadable module into the running kernel is a potential security
problem, so
some administrators want to be able to restrict which modules are allowed.
One way to do that is to cryptographically sign modules and have the kernel
verify that signature before loading the module.
<a href="/Articles/515007/">Module signing</a> isn't for everyone, and
those who aren't interested 
probably don't want to pay much of a price for that new feature.  Even
those who are interested will want to minimize that price. While
cryptographically signing kernel modules can provide a security benefit,
that boon comes with a cost: slower kernel builds. When that cost is
multiplied across a vast 
number of kernel builds, it draws some attention. 
</p>

<p>
David Miller <a
href="https://plus.google.com/101384639386588513837/posts/aLXZdGRULkP">complained</a>
on Google+
about the cost of module signing in mid-October.  Greg Kroah-Hartman agreed
in the 
comments, noting that 
an allmodconfig build took more than 10% longer between 3.6 and 3.7-rc1.
The problem is the addition of module signing to the build process.
Allmodconfig builds the kernel with as many modules as possible, which has
the effect of build-testing nearly all of the kernel.  Maintainers like
Miller and Kroah-Hartman do that kind of build frequently, typically after
each patch they apply, in order to ensure that the kernel still builds.
Module signing can, of course, be turned off using
<tt>CONFIG_MODULE_SIG</tt>, but that adds a manual configuration step to
the build 
process, which is annoying. 
</p>

<p>
Linus Torvalds noted Miller's complaint and offered up a "<q>*much*
simpler</q>" solution: <a href="/Articles/520259/">defer module
signing</a> until install time.  There is already a mechanism to strip
modules during the <tt>make&nbsp;modules_install</tt> step.  Torvalds's
change adds module signing into that step, which means that you don't pay
the signing price until you actually install the modules.  There are some
use cases that would not be supported by this change, but Torvalds
essentially dismissed them:
<div class="BigQuote">
Sure, it means that if you want to load modules directly from your
kernel build tree (without installing them), you'd better be running a
kernel that doesn't need the signing (or you need to sign things
explicitly). But seriously, nobody cares. If you are building a module
after booting the kernel with the intention of loading that modified
module, you aren't going to be doing that whole module signing thing
*anyway*. Signed modules make sense when building the kernel and
module together, so signing them as we install the kernel and module
is just sensible.
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the main proponents behind the module signing feature over
the years has been David Howells; his code was used as the basis for module
maintainer Rusty Russell's <a href="/Articles/515032/">signature
infrastructure patch</a>.  But, Howells was <a href="/Articles/525884/">not
particularly happy</a> with Torvalds's changes.  He would like to be able
to handle some of the use cases that
Torvalds dismissed, including loading modules from the kernel build
tree. He thinks that  automatic
signing 
should probably just be removed from the build process; a script could be
provided 
to do signing manually.  
</p>

<p>
Howells is looking at the signed modules problem from a distribution view.
Currently, the keys 
used to sign modules can be auto-generated at build time, with the public key
getting built into the kernel and the private portion being used for
signing&mdash;and then likely deleted once the build finishes.  That isn't
how distributions will do things, so
auto-generating keys concerns Howells:
<div class="BigQuote">
 It would also be nice to get rid of the key autogeneration stuff.  I'm not
keen on the idea of unparameterised key autogeneration - anyone signing their
modules should really supply the appropriate address elements. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
That may make sense for distributions or those who will be using long-lived
keys, but it makes little sense for a more basic use case.  With
characteristic bluntness, Torvalds <a href="/Articles/525889/">pointed that
out</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
You seem to dismiss the "people
want to build their own kernel" people entirely.
<p>
One of the main sane use-cases for module signing is:
<p>
 - CONFIG_CHECK_SIGNATURE=y<br>
 - randomly generated one-time key<br>
 - "make modules_install; make install"<br>
 - "make clean" to get rid of the keys.<br>
 - reboot.<br>
<p>
and now you have a custom kernel that has the convenience of modules,
yet is basically as safe as a non-modular build. The above makes it
much harder for any kind of root-kit module to be loaded, and
basically entirely avoids one fundamental security scare of modules.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/525908/">agreed</a> with the need to
support the use case Torvalds described,
though he noted that keys are not removed by <tt>make&nbsp;clean</tt>,
which he considered a bit worrisome.  It
turns out that <tt>make&nbsp;clean</tt> is documented to leave the files
needed to build modules, so <tt>make&nbsp;distclean</tt> should be
used to get rid of the key files.
</p>

<p>
Russell, who has always been a bit skeptical of module signing, <a
href="/Articles/525912/">pointed out</a> that Torvalds's use case could be
handled by just storing the hashes of the modules in the kernel&mdash;no
cryptography necessary.  While that's true, Russell's scheme would disallow some
other use cases.  Signing provides flexibility, Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/525915/">said</a>, and is "<q>technically the right
thing to do</q>".  Russell <a href="/Articles/525918/">countered</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
 It's 52k of extra text to get that 'nice flexible'; 1% of my
kernel image.  That's a lot of bug free code.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Russell's concerns
notwithstanding, it is clear that module signing is here to stay.
Torvalds's change was added for 3.7 (with some additions by Russell and
Howells).  For
distributions, Josh Boyer has a <a href="/Articles/525943/">patch</a> that
will add a "<tt>modules_sign</tt>" target.  It will operate on the modules
in their installed location (i.e. after a <tt>modules_install</tt>), and remove
the signature, which will allow the distribution packaging system (e.g. RPM) to
generate debuginfo for the modules before re-signing them.  In that way,
distributions can use Torvalds's solution at the cost of signing modules
twice.  Since that process should be far less frequent than developers
building kernels (or build farms building kernels or ...), that tradeoff is
likely to be well worth that small amount of pain.

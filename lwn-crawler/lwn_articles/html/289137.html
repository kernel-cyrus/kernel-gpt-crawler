<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 8, 2008</br>
           </div>
One of the fundamental data structures in the networking subsystem is the
transmit queue associated with each device.  

The core networking code will call a driver's
<tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> function to let the driver know that a packet is
ready for transmission; it is then the
driver's job to feed that packet into the hardware's transmit queue.
The result is a data structure which looks vaguely like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/net-tx-old.png" width=512 height=41
alt="[Network transmit queue]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
"Vaguely" because the list of <tt>sk_buff</tt> structures (SKBs - the
internal representation of packets) does not exist in this form within the
kernel; instead, the driver maintains the queue in a way that the hardware
can process it.
<p>
This is a scheme which has worked well for years, but it has run into a
fundamental limitation: it does not map well to devices which have multiple
transmit queues.  Such devices are becoming increasingly common, especially
in the wireless networking area.  Devices which implement the Wireless
Multimedia Extensions, for example, can have four different classes of
service: video, voice, best-effort, and background.  Video and voice
traffic may receive higher priority within the device - it is
transmitted first - and the device can also take more of the available air
time for such packets.  On the other hand, the queues for this kind of traffic may
be relatively short; if a video packet doesn't get sent on its way quickly,
the receiving end will lose interest and move on.  So it might be better to just
drop video packets which have been delayed for too long.  
<p>

On the other hand, the "background" level only gets transmitted if there is
nothing else to do; it is well-suited to low-priority traffic like bittorrent
or email from the boss.  It would make sense to have a
relatively long queue for background packets, though, to be able to take
full advantage of a lull in higher-priority traffic.

<p>

Within these devices, each class of service has its own transmit queue.
This separation of traffic makes it easy for the hardware to choose which
packet to transmit next.  It also allows independent limits on the size of
each queue; there is no point in filling the device's queue space with
background traffic which is not going to be transmitted in any case.  But
the networking subsystem does not have any built-in support for multiqueue
devices.  This hardware has been driven using a number of creative
techniques which have gotten the job done, but not in an optimal way.  That
may be about to change, though, with the advent of David Miller's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/288940/">multiqueue transmit patch
series</a>. 
<p>

The current code treats a network device as the fundamental unit which is
managed by the outgoing packet scheduler.  David's patches change that
idea somewhat, since each transmit queue will need to be scheduled
independently.  So there is a new <tt>netdev_queue</tt> structure which
encapsulates all of the information about a single transmit queue, and
which is protected by its own lock.  Multiqueue drivers then set up an
array of these structures.  So the new data structure can, with sufficient
imagination, be seen to look something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/net-tx-mq.png" width=452 height=252
alt="[Multiqueue tx structure]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
Once again, the actual lists of outgoing packets normally exist in the form
of special data structures in device-accessible memory.  Once the device
has these queues set up for it, the various policies associated with each
class of service can be implemented.  Each queue is managed independently,
so more voice packets can be queued even if some other queue (background,
say) is overflowing.
<p>
David would appear to have worked hard to avoid creating trouble for
network driver developers.  Drivers for single-queue devices need not be
changed at all, and the addition of multiqueue support is relatively
straightforward.  The first step is to replace the
<tt>alloc_etherdev()</tt> call with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    struct net_device *alloc_etherdev_mq(int sizeof_priv, 
                                         unsigned int queue_count);
</pre>
<p>
The new <tt>queue_count</tt> parameter describes the maximum number of
transmit queues that the device might support.  The actual number in use
should be stored in the <tt>real_num_tx_queues</tt> field of the
<tt>net_device</tt> structure.  Note that this value can only be changed
when the device is down.
<p>
A multiqueue driver will get packets destined for any queue via the usual
<tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> function.  To determine which queue to use, the
driver should call:
<p>
<pre>
    u16 skb_get_queue_mapping(struct sk_buff *skb);
</pre>
<p>
The return value is an index into the array of transmit queues.  One might
well wonder how the networking core decides which queue to use in the first
place.  That is handled via a new <tt>net_device</tt> callback:
<p>
<pre>
    u16	(*select_queue)(struct net_device *dev, struct sk_buff *skb);
</pre>
<p>
The patch set includes an implementation of <tt>select_queue()</tt> which
can be used with WME-capable devices.
<p>
About the only other required change is for multiqueue drivers to inform
the networking core about the status of specific queues.  To that end,
there is a new set of functions:
<p>
<pre>
    struct netdev_queue *netdev_get_tx_queue(struct net_device *dev,
                                             u16 index);

    void netif_tx_start_queue(struct netdev_queue *dev_queue);
    void netif_tx_wake_queue(struct netdev_queue *dev_queue);
    void netif_tx_stop_queue(struct netdev_queue *dev_queue);
</pre>
<p>

A call to <tt>netdev_get_tx_queue()</tt> will turn a queue index into the
<tt>struct netdev_queue</tt> pointer required by the other functions, which
can be used to stop and start the queue in the usual manner.  Should the
driver need to operate on all of the queues at once, there is a set of
helper functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void netif_tx_start_all_queues(struct net_device *dev);
    void netif_tx_wake_all_queues(struct net_device *dev);
    void netif_tx_stop_all_queues(struct net_device *dev);
</pre>
<p>
Naturally, there are a few other details to deal with, and the multiqueue
interface is likely to evolve somewhat over time.  At one point, David was
hoping to have this feature ready for inclusion into 2.6.27, but that goal
looks overly ambitious now.  It does seem that <a
href="/Articles/289154/">much of the ground work</a> will be merged in the
next development cycle, though, meaning that full multiqueue support should
be in good shape for merging in 2.6.28.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmmm, thanks for the link :) I'm still very confused though.

Both in his blog and in the patch series initial comment, David mentions duplicating the
qdiscs so that he'd have one per queue rather than one per device. I'm confused about whether
this is supposed to be just an implementation detail to reduce locking somehow, or if this
would be exposed in the traffic shaping user visible interface (in which case I don't
understand how you'd use that :)

      <p>I don't know about DaveM's work, but real routers offer differing QoS policies per class-of-traffic queue (eg, a limited queue length with tail drop for a class with voice traffic, a long queue with RED drop for classes with TCP traffic). Since Linux implements scheduling and queue policies using qdiscs, a qdisc per queue would make sense.</p>

I think that the main issue was to push the tx lock into the queue.
This was a major shortcoming of the previous implementation.

Virtual machine networking performance can be improved by virtualising tcp offloading
functions often found in hardware network cards. Instead of the virtual machine doing all the
tcpy stuff then ethernetty stuff and passing the packet to the host machine which then has to
do some processing on it as well, the virtual machines asks its hardware accelerator functions
to take care of it... this can put it more quickly into the hosts actual hardware and save a
chunk of double processing.

I'm not sure about multiple hardware queues. The hardware, drivers, and virtual machine would
have to be designed for it, allowing each virtual machine direct access to a hardware queue,
with the hardware potentially having to do virtual memory mapping so the virtual machine can't
use it to grab data from the hosts memory, and then the hardware deciding how to schedule
packets from each machine over each other. Aside from all of this, giving a virtual machine
direct access to the real hardware somewhat defeats the purpose of it.

Basically we are taking the path of hardware accelerated traffic classes.
Indeed, now the layer above would feed the queues according to the QoS bandwidth allocated for
each one of them... may we have in the near futur hardware QoS bandwidth on those queues too?
That would offload work from the IPv6 stack for traffic classes management.

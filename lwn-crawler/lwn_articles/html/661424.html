<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 21, 2015</br>
           </div>
A "wait queue" in the kernel is a data structure that allows one or more
processes to wait (sleep) until something of interest happens.  They
are used 
throughout the kernel to wait for available memory, I/O completion, message
arrival, and many other things.  In the early days of Linux, a wait queue
was a simple list of waiting processes, but various scalability problems
(including the thundering herd problem highlighted by the infamous <a
href="http://www.mindcraft.com/whitepapers/nts4rhlinux.html">Mindcraft
report</a> in 1999) have led to the addition of a fair amount of complexity
since then.  The <a href="/Articles/661415/">simple wait queue</a> patch
set is an attempt to push the pendulum back in the other direction.
<p>
Simple wait queues are not new; we <a href="/Articles/577370/">looked at
them</a> in 2013.  The API has not really changed since then, so that
discussion will not be repeated here.  For those who don't want to go back
to the previous article, the executive summary is that simple wait
queues provide an interface quite similar to that of regular wait queues,
but with a 
lot of the bells and whistles removed.  Said bells (or perhaps they are
whistles) include exclusive wakeups (an important feature motivated by the
aforementioned Mindcraft report), <a href="/Articles/288056/">"killable"
waits</a>, high-resolution timeouts, and more.
<p>
There is value in simplicity, of course, and the memory saved by switching
to a simple wait queue is welcome, even if it's small.  But that, alone,
would not be justification for the addition of another wait-queue mechanism
to the kernel.  Adding another low-level scheduling primitive like this
increases the complexity of the kernel as a whole and makes ongoing
maintenance of the scheduler harder.  It is unlikely to happen without a
strong and convincing argument in its favor.
<p>
In this case, the drive for simple wait queues is (as is the code itself)
coming from the realtime project.  The realtime developers seek determinism
at all times, and, as it turns out, current mainline wait queues get in the
way.
<p>
The most problematic aspect of ordinary wait queues appears to be the
ability to add custom wakeup callbacks.  By default, if one of the various
<tt>wake_up()</tt> functions is called to wake processes sleeping on a wait
queue, the kernel will call <tt>default_wake_function()</tt>, which simply
wakes these waiting processes.  But there is a mechanism provided to allow
specialized users to change the wake-up behavior of wait queues:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef int (*wait_queue_func_t)(wait_queue_t *wait, unsigned mode,
    				     int flags, void *key);
    void init_waitqueue_func_entry(wait_queue_t *q, wait_queue_func_t func);
</pre>
<p>
This feature is only used in a handful of places in the kernel, but they
are important uses.  The I/O multiplexing system calls (<tt>poll()</tt>,
<tt>select()</tt>, and <tt>epoll_wait()</tt>) use it to turn specific
device events into poll events for waiting processes.  The <a
href="/Articles/636226/"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt> code</a> (added for the 4.3
release) has a wake function that only does a wakeup for events in the
address range of interest.  The <tt>exit()</tt> code similarly uses a
custom wake function to only wake processes that have an interest in the
exiting process.  And so on.  It is a feature that cannot be removed.
<p>
The problem with this feature, from the realtime developers' point of view,
is that they have no control over how long the custom wake function will
take to run.  This feature thus makes it harder for them to provide
response-time guarantees.  Beyond that, these callbacks require that the
wait-queue structure be protected by an ordinary spinlock, which is a
sleeping lock in the realtime tree.  That, too, gets in the way in the
realtime world; it prevents, for example, the use of <tt>wake_up()</tt> in
hard (as opposed to threaded) interrupt handlers.
<p>
Simple wait queues dispense with custom callbacks and many other wait-queue
features, allowing the entire data structure to be reduced to:
<p>
<pre>
    struct swait_queue_head {
	raw_spinlock_t		lock;
	struct list_head	task_list;
    };

    struct swait_queue {
	struct task_struct	*task;
	struct list_head	task_list;
    };
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>swait_queue_head</tt> structure represents the wait queue as a
whole, while <tt>struct swait_queue</tt> represents a process waiting in
the queue.  Waiting is just a matter of adding a new <tt>swait_queue</tt>
entry to the list, and wakeups are a simple traversal of that list.
Regular wait queues, instead, may have to search the list for specific
processes to wake.  The lack of custom wakeup callbacks means that the time
required to wake any individual process on the list is known (and short),
so a raw spinlock can be used to protect the whole thing.
<p>
This patch set has been posted by Daniel Wagner, who has taken on the
challenge of getting it into the mainline, but the core wait-queue work was
done by Peter Zijlstra.  It has seen a few revisions in the last few
months, but comments appear to be slowing down.  One never knows with such
things (the patches looked mostly ready in 2013 as well), but it seems like
there is not much keeping this work from going into the 4.4 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

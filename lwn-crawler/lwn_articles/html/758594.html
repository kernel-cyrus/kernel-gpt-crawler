<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 29, 2018</br>
           </div>
One of the the most commonly repeated mistakes in system-call design is <a
href="/Articles/588444/">a failure to check for unknown flags</a> wherever
flags are accepted.  If there is ever a point where callers can get away
with setting unknown flags, then adding new flags becomes a hazardous act.
In the case of <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>,
though, developers found a clever way around this problem.  A recent
discussion has briefly called that approach into question, though, and
raised the issue of what constitutes a kernel regression.  No changes are
forthcoming as a result, but the discussion does provide an opportunity to
look at both the specific hack and how the kernel community decides whether
a change is a regression or not.

<p>
Back in 2017, several developers were trying to figure out a way to safely allow
direct user-space access to files stored on nonvolatile memory devices.
The hardware allows this memory to be addressed directly by the processor,
but any changes could go astray if the filesystem were to move blocks around
at the same time.  The solution that arose was a new <tt>mmap()</tt> flag
called <a href="/Articles/731706/"><tt>MAP_SYNC</tt></a>.  When a file is
mapped with this flag set (and the file is stored on a nonvolatile memory
device), the kernel will take extra care to ensure that access to the
mapping and filesystem-level changes will not conflict with each other.  As
far as applications are concerned, using this flag solves the problem.
<p>
Or, at least, it would solve the problem if it weren't for the
unknown-flags problem, which has afflicted <tt>mmap()</tt> since the
beginning.  <tt>mmap()</tt> is not allowed (<strike>by standards like
POSIX</strike> by many years of history) to
return an error when given unknown flags.  One possible problem that can
result from adding a new flag to such a system call is that some program
that was, for whatever reason, setting the <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> flag already
could see a change of behavior; that should not be a huge issue with this
particular flag.  More serious is that there is no way for an application
to know that the kernel it's running on at the moment supports
<tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> at all, since all kernels will return success with that
flag set.  Any application that is depending on <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> to ensure
the integrity of its data needs to know for sure that the feature is
supported, but <tt>mmap()</tt> provides no way to obtain that knowledge.
<p>
The solution to this problem came out of the realization that
<tt>mmap()</tt> supports two flags — <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> and
<tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> — that are mutually contradictory.  Any
<tt>mmap()</tt> call with both flags set will fail, so it is a certainty
that no working programs are making such calls.  This combination is thus
potentially available for other uses.  <a 
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1c9725974074a047f6080eecc62c50a8e840d050">This
commit</a> added a new "flag" called <tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> that was
defined as the combination of <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> and <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt>;
it requests the creation of a shared mapping, but also requests the
explicit validation of any other flags provided in that call.  Filesystems
and device drivers that support flags beyond the "legacy set" can tell the
kernel (via the <tt>mmap_supported_flags</tt> field in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.17.3/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1703"><tt>struct
file_operations</tt></a>) about that fact.  In the absence of this
information, the kernel will conclude that those flags are unsupported and
(in the presence of <tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt>)
fail any call that tries to use them.

<p>
Both <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> and <tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> were merged for the
4.15 release.  An application that uses both flags in its <tt>mmap()</tt>
call can be sure that <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> is actually supported by both the
kernel and the filesystem that the mapped file is stored in.  The kernel
community has, in other words, found a way to add (optional) flag
validation to a system call that is defined by the standards to not perform
that validation.
<p>
Recently, though, Eric Sandeen <a href="/Articles/758597/">stumbled across</a>
<tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> and realized that its addition changed the
behavior of the 
<tt>mmap()</tt> system call in a possibly surprising way.  Before, passing
both <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> and <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> would cause
<tt>mmap()</tt> to fail; now the call may succeed.  Some application could
perhaps pass those two flags (with no knowledge of
<tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt>) and see a different result than before.
Calling this change a "regression", Sandeen
wrote a patch that restored the previous behavior in the absence of flags
outside of the legacy set; in other words, <tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt>
would fail if there were no special flags to validate.
<p>
That patch will not be merged, though.  Linus Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/758598/">stressed</a> that a change in behavior is not, in
itself, a regression.  To be a regression, the change must break programs
that were working before.  The bits that make up
<tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> were explicitly chosen because no program
using that combination could possibly have been working, so none could be
broken.  Torvalds described it as the logical equivalent of adding a new
system call; programs that tried to invoke that call before it was added
will certainly see a change in behavior, but it's hard to describe that as
a regression.
<p>
Instead, Sandeen's patch might cause currently working <tt>mmap()</tt>
calls to start failing; perhaps some application is using
<tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> even though it uses no other flags that
require validation.  That <i>would</i> be a regression.  So the behavior of
<tt>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</tt> will remain unchanged in the (likely)
continued absence of reports of broken applications.
<p>
Experience shows that programs can depend on just about any subtle aspect
of a system's behavior; <a href="http://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's law</a>
has been borne out many times.  No problems have been reported in the six
months since 4.15 was released, though, so the chances are that this
particular change is regression-free.  There <i>is</i> one fix to be made,
though: the <tt>mmap()</tt> man page still says that passing
both <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> and <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> will result in an error,
which is no longer true.  That, fortunately, is an easy problem to fix.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What the documentation needs is a state table. Unfortunately these can be big.<br>
<p>
This gives us two things. (a) if it isn't in the state table it isn't guaranteed to work. And (b) if it should be in the state table then it's undefined.<br>
<p>
This brings me to one of my big programming bugbears - the state table of "do you want me to ignore these problems". When a programmer add the "do you want me to remember your choice?" they usually, only define three of the four possible states. "ignore error", "ignore error now and in future", and "fail on error". The option "fail on error and remember this choice" very rarely works :-(<br>

That’s sort of the point of Hyrum’s Law:<br>
With enough users, we can’t.  Some of the “we” won’t listen or will never get the chance to hear it or will be unable to follow the requirement (which is what the previous poster suggests).  And for a big open project we can’t just say “you’re wrong, fix it”, at least, not if you want to keep users.<br>
<p>
So if you follow the Linus philosophy of “don’t break real users if at all possible” (and I think that’s almost the only sane way to run a big, open low level (ie many things built atop it) project like the kernel), then you’re extra stuck.<br>

A much better rule: any export that isn't explicitly documented to be experimental, for internal use, testing purposes, or similar, can be considered to be a stable part of the API (unless serious security concerns necessitates its removal).<br>
<p>
While we ideally want all APIs to be well documented, I think it's a fair assumption that it's easier to simply to "document" the non-API than to write proper documentation for the API.<br>

That doesn't clarify anything. What does it mean for an API to be stable? In particular, for this topic, is returning an “unsupported operation” error part of the API? <br>

" mmap() is not allowed (by standards like POSIX) to return an error when given unknown flags."<br>
<p>
So f…ing what? not the first instance where Linux basically ignores POSIX because it makes no sense.<br>

Are there really programs out there that do call mmap() with random flag bits, or is that an overabundance of unnecessary caution?<br>

To me this smells like an implementation error made when mmap() was first introduced, which was later codified as official behaviour, because some user code failed to initialize all flag bits...<br>

POSIX allows functions to return errors that are not documented. For example, almost any syscall may return ENOMEM (maybe not getppid ;-)<br>
<p>
"Implementations may support additional errors not included in this list, may generate errors included in this list under circumstances other than those described here, or may contain extensions or limitations that prevent some errors from occurring." (1003.1-2017 section 2.3 of System Interfaces)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; mmap() is not allowed (by standards like POSIX) to return an error when given unknown flags</font><br>
<p>
I've reread the relevant sections of POSIX and can't find this. Where in <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/</a> is mmap() prohibited from returning an error when given unknown flags?<br>

      Sigh, it looks like I got caught going with what I thought I knew and not actually checking it, sorry.  The behavior of <tt>mmap()</tt> <i>is</i> defined by decades of actual practice, though.

What programs, in practice, called mmap with unknown flags and expected them to pass silently?<br>

Too many, probably :-(<br>
<p>
You've only got to set the flags you want in a variable that you forgot to initialise to zero...<br>
<p>
And what's the betting that programmers have done that in times gone by. We tend to be rather more careful now, having been bitten once too many.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

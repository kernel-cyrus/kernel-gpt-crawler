<h1>Flushing the page cache from user space</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 22, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Martin Hicks recently posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/123343/">a
patch</a> which adds a new degree of user-space control over memory
management policy.  In particular, it creates a new <tt>/proc</tt> entry:
<p>
<pre>
    /proc/sys/vm/toss_page_cache_nodes
</pre>
<p>
If a suitably privileged process writes one or more NUMA node numbers to
that file, all pages belonging to that node which are found in the page
cache will be flushed out.  Essentially, this operation causes a node to
forget about all locally-cached pages from files in the filesystem.
<p>

Clearing the page cache in this way would normally be bad for performance.
The page cache exists to allow the filesystem to satisfy common filesystem
requests without going to the disk; clearing the cache defeats that
functionality and would normally be undesirable.  There are exceptions to
everything, however.  This patch is aimed at large-scale high-performance
computing tasks running in a cluster environment.  Such jobs typically do
best if they can start with a clean system; they have no real use for
whatever may have been cached for the previous user.  More to the point, a
full page cache can cause memory allocations to be satisfied with non-local
(slower) memory, resulting in significantly worse performance.  By clearing
the cache before starting a new job, a system administrator can ensure that
local memory is available for that job.
<p>

Not everybody likes the patch.  Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/124566/">thinks</a> that this capability will create
confusion and make the debugging of memory problems even harder.  
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	How are we supposed to debug VM problems where one player
	periodically flushes the whole pagecache? ... Providing APIs to
	flush system caches, sysctl or syscall, is the road to VM madness.
</div>
<p>

Andrew Morton, instead, sees the value of the patch for some users, but <a
href="/Articles/124567/">doesn't like the implementation</a>.  He would
like to see this capability made useful for other classes of users, such as
kernel developers who want to put the system into a known state before
running tests.  He also doesn't like the <tt>/proc</tt> interface, and
argues for a new system call instead.  His suggestion was:
<p>
<pre>
    sys_free_node_memory(long node_id, long pages_to_make_free, 
                         long what_to_free);
</pre>
<p>
This form of the call would allow the clearing of something less than the
entire page cache, making the tool a bit less crude.  The
<tt>what_to_free</tt> argument would be a bitmask specifying which types of
memory to free; beyond the page cache, this call could cause the kernel to
reclaim anonymous memory or slab caches.
<p>

The system call approach would seem to make sense; there is one remaining
glitch, however: SUSE already shipped the <tt>/proc</tt> interface in
SLES9.  That revelation drew <a href="/Articles/124569/">a complaint</a>
from Andrew:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is why you should target kernel.org kernels first.  Now we
	risk ending up with poor old suse carrying an obsolete interface
	and application developers have to be able to cater for both
	interfaces.
</div>
<p>
An explicit purpose behind the 2.6 development model is to get patches into
the mainline quickly so that their form can be stabilized before
distributors ship them.  As the developers become used to this mode of
operation, this sort of issue should become relatively rare.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      To me, and to most of us, a much more helpful feature would be a way to identify inodes whose pages should not be cached at all.  So that it could be used by unprivileged processes, the effect might apply only for the current process: pages seen by another process from that inode would still stick in the cache, and the current process would still use those, but reads or writes  (or unmappings) it initiates would wash out of the cache immediately.  
<p>
We might also, or instead, have an attribute stored on the inode to identify an uncached file.  Then, most programs wouldn't need to know about the feature.
<p>
Tar and xine might be good examples of programs that should know about, or at least benefit from, such a feature.

      fadvise and madvise could provide this feature for programs like tar &amp; <br>
xine.  madvise(addr, len, MADV_DONTNEED) will tell the kernel that a <br>
given virtual address range is unlikely to be accessed again anytime <br>
soon, and I believe there's an equivalent for files as well. <br>

      <a  
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_fadvise.html">posix_fadvise</a>  
already provides that functionality.  
posix_fadvise(fd,0,0,POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE); will tell the kernel that each  
byte of a file is only accessed once, while  
posix_fadvise(fd,start,len,POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED); will tell the kernel  
that a particular range of data is finished with.  
<p>Apart from developer time, there's no real reason not to use  
posix_fadvise and <a 
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_madvise.html">posix_madvise</a> 
(the equivalent for memory mapped  
objects); if the kernel doesn't handle them, they get ignored, and they  
make it possible for the kernel to do more intelligent caching if it does  
understand them.

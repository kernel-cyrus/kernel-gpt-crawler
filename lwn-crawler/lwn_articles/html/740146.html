<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 29, 2017</br>
           </div>
Diligent developers do their best to anticipate things that can go wrong
and write appropriate error-handling code.  Unfortunately, error-handling
code is especially hard to test and, as a result, often goes untested; the
code meant to deal with errors, in other words, is likely to contain errors
itself.  One way of finding those bugs is to inject errors into a running
system and watching how it responds; the kernel may soon have a new
mechanism for doing this sort of injection.
<p>
As an example of error handling in the kernel, consider memory
allocations.  There are few tasks that can be performed in kernel space
without allocating memory to work with.  Memory allocation operations can
fail (<a href="/Articles/627419/">in theory, at least</a>), so any code
that contains a call to a function like <tt>kmalloc()</tt> must check the
returned pointer and do the right thing if the requested memory was not
actually allocated.  But <tt>kmalloc()</tt> almost never fails in a running
kernel, so testing the failure-handling paths is hard.  It is probably fair
to say that a large percentage of allocation-failure paths in the kernel
have never been executed; some of those are certainly wrong.
<p>
The kernel gained <a href="/Articles/209257/">a fault-injection
framework</a> back in 2006; it can be used to test error-handling paths by
causing memory allocation 
requests to fail.  Just making <tt>kmalloc()</tt> fail universally is
unlikely to be helpful, though; execution will almost certainly never make
it to the code that the developer actually wants to test.  The
fault-injection framework has some parameters to control which allocation
attempts should fail, but the mechanism is somewhat awkward to use and is
not as flexible as one might like.  So the number of developers actually
using this framework is small.
<p>
Fully generalizing fault injection would be a lot of work.  A developer may
want to see what happens when a specific <tt>kmalloc()</tt> call fails, but
perhaps only when it is invoked from a specific call path or when some
other condition is true.  It has not been possible in the past to describe
these conditions to the framework but, in recent years, a new technology
has come along that can provide the required flexibility: the BPF virtual
machine.
<p>
It is already possible to attach a BPF program to an arbitrary function
using the kprobe mechanism.  Such programs are useful for information
gathering, but they cannot be used to affect the execution of the function
they are attached to.  Thus, they are not usable for error injection.  That
situation changes, though, with <a href="/Articles/739442/">this patch
set</a> from Josef Bacik, which is intended to turn BPF into a generalized
mechanism for the injection of errors into a running kernel.
<p>
The core of the new mechanism is a BPF-callable function called
<tt>bpf_override_return()</tt>.  If a BPF program attached to a kprobe
calls this function, the execution of the function the program is attached
to will be shorted out and its return value will be replaced with a value
supplied by that BPF program.  The patch set contains <a
href="/Articles/740148/">an example</a> in the form of a test program:
<p>
<pre>
    SEC("kprobe/open_ctree")
    int bpf_prog1(struct pt_regs *ctx)
    {
	unsigned long rc = -12;

	bpf_override_return(ctx, rc);
	return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>

This function can be compiled to BPF using the LLVM compiler.  The
<tt>SEC()</tt> directive at the top specifies that this function should be
attached to a kprobe placed at the beginning of <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.14.2/source/fs/btrfs/disk-io.c#L2555"><tt>open_ctree()</tt></a>,
a function in the Btrfs filesystem implementation.  After the placement of
this probe and the attachment of the BPF function, a call to
<tt>open_ctree()</tt> will be overridden and the value -12
(<tt>-ENOMEM</tt>) will be returned.  This is a relatively simplistic
example, of course; it is expected that many uses will require more
sophisticated BPF programs to narrow down the set of situations where the
injection will occur.
<p>
This patch set had been through several revisions and appeared ready for
inclusion into the mainline; it had even been <a
href="/Articles/740149/">applied</a> to the networking tree for the 4.15
merge window.  Things came to a halt, though, when Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/740151/">blocked</a> the progress of this patch set out of
worries that it violated one of the basic promises behind the BPF virtual
machine and could destabilize the kernel:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	One of the major advantages of having an in-kernel BPF sandbox is
	to never crash the kernel - and allowing BPF programs to just
	randomly modify the return value of kernel functions sounds
	immensely broken to me.
</div>
<p>
After some discussion, a solution was agreed to: BPF programs would retain
the ability to override kernel functions, but only for functions that have
been specifically marked to allow this to happen.  A new macro called
<tt>BPF_ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION()</tt> was introduced; it can be used to add
the required annotation to a function.  See, for example, <a
href="/Articles/740152/">this patch</a> adding the marking for
<tt>open_ctree()</tt>.  Molnar <a href="/Articles/740155/">suggested</a>
some additional conditions — only functions whose return value cannot crash
the kernel should be annotated, and the override function should only
change integer error values — but nothing enforces those rules in the
current patch set.
<p>
Bacik's patch set only marks that one function; it is not clear whether
those markings will be added in any quantity to the mainline kernel, or
whether they will, instead, be maintained as private patches by the
developers who use them.  One can imagine that there could be some
resistance to marking up the mainline in this way.  But, on the other hand,
there would be value in marking functions like <tt>kmalloc()</tt> to enable
the development of generic tools that can be used to test specific
allocation-error handling paths.  
<p>
That question is only likely to be resolved once the mechanism is in place
and patches marking functions for error injection start to appear.  
Meanwhile, the objections to the core mechanism have been addressed, and
its path into the mainline appears to be clear.  It has missed the 4.15
merge window, though, so it will almost certainly have to wait until 4.16.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I believe most code cannot be unit tested without mock objects/functions/BPF programs.</font><br>
<p>
I applaud the spirit of your sentence, but the specific meaning of the words you used is wrong. A unit test is an isolatable unit which should never touch outside and can be run in embarrassingly-parallel concurrent fashion; integration tests are the counterpart which validate that the functional units integrate correctly with the rest of the program and system. This matches up nicely with the design paradigm of 'separation of interfaces and implementation' which has benefits in refactoring and deprecating old implementation details while presenting the same interface to consumers (plus optionally allowing different versions of your interfaces to be in use, maintained and stable). Having the right words for these situations helps clear thinking when designing and implementing systems.<br>
<p>
A unit test shouldn't need a lot of state supplied by the test harness; shouldn't need to reach outside its function, procedure or method to show that it's doing what you believe it should be doing. There's a 'bad code smell' that comes with complex units. You know those times when they're flaky because they're vulnerable to side effects? I typically advise people with complex unit tests to refactor and simplify the tests as well as simplifying the underlying code. How can you not like simpler code plus you get embarrassingly-parallel concurrency for running these tests when they're little atoms of logic?  <br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I find it strange if it's not between #ifdef DEBUG and #endif directives...</font><br>
You might even wrap the BPF_ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() annotation macro in a config wrapper so that no prod system has this injector but someone looking to replicate an observed failure can work on it. It's a given that you'd have to be careful that you're running through the exact same logic as the production binary that failed. <br>

that's the theory, the practice is that they're needed to test interfaces and sometimes even code designed and written two decades ago<br>
<p>
theoretical purism also doesn't help in the initial refactoring of the code - how can you refactor code if you can't know if you're not changing its behaviour because you don't have test cases for it?<br>

Oh, so you're talking about integration testing, which is something I'm keen that you know to be distinct from unit testing? Conflating these two things is bad for your code!<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; how can you refactor code if you can't know if you're not changing its behaviour because you don't have test cases for it?</font><br>
<p>
One of my favourite books is Michael C. Feathers' "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" which calmly and politely says, again and again:<br>
0. write tests round the code as it is, as best you understand it*<br>
1. change the code, i.e. refactor or add functionality<br>
2. ensure the tests keep working<br>
<p>
*: ...and write more tests as you come to understand it better<br>
<p>
You might sample existing data on the live system and replay it, but that's unlikely to protect against embarrassing edge cases. You might instrument your existing code and log its data flows while live, then reproduce them in your test framework, but it loses validity over time. The shortest route to a reliable system when you don't understand it is, from experience, the workflow which loops through "wrap with tests as best you understand it / change the code / ensure the tests continue to pass."<br>

if you don't have units that can be tested in isolation (most of kernel code) then by definition you don't have unit tests :)<br>

I think the BPF part of this is perfectly reasonable. After all, BPF programs have always been about specifying something different that happens instead of what was requested. On the other hand, I'd expect it to get attached to something like "fault/open_ctree", which would only be a possible target if you'd compiled in fault injection. That is, a BPF program can never crash the kernel, but the kernel could consult a BPF program to decide whether to crash itself, assuming the kernel supports conditionally crashing itself.<br>

Perhaps a way for the person loading the BPF programme to say that they really wanted to do that, rather than having to say at kernel build time what can be overridden?  I would expect this to be interesting to a very different audience to typical BPF users, and one that can live with the occasional kernel crash.<br>

In my experience, out-of-memory linux machine always needs reboot, especially if it uses NFS homes.  Allowing a BPF program to bring the computer completely to unusable state does not differ from allowing it to crash kernel.<br>
<p>
I understand that "out-of-memory linux machine always needs reboot" is the point they are trying to fix, but the way chosen looks strange for me.  I think there should be a way to disable this feature for production kernels.<br>

It's a config option, I suspect most distros will have it off.  And I don't just want it for memory, in fact I originally did it for testing NBD's handling of getting EINTR back from kernel_sendmsg since that path is hard to test in a targeted way.  I've used it for memory stuff as well, cases where we do GFP_ATOMIC allocations and expect that it may fail and should be handling the failure gracefully but weren't, so it was handy for that as well.  There are a myriad of reasons to use this beyond just randomly OOM'ing in certain places.<br>

"Just making kmalloc() fail universally is unlikely to be helpful".<br>
<p>
I actually wrote a patch once where you would boot, then write to a sysfs file and after that every kmalloc() would fail the first time you call it.  You had to start applications five times before they had triggered the allocation failures and were able to run but it all worked surprisingly well.<br>

I renamed kmalloc() to kmalloc_real() and then made a macro named kmalloc() to call kmalloc_real().  The macro returned NULL the first time it was called when the sysfs flag was set.<br>
<p>
Something like this (written on phone).<br>
<p>
#define kmalloc(size, gfp) ({<br>
Void *ret;<br>
Static int tested;<br>
If (sysfs &amp;&amp; !tested) {<br>
    Ret = NULL;<br>
    Tested = 1;<br>
} Else {<br>
    Ret = kmalloc_real(size, gfp);<br>

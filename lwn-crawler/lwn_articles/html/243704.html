<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 31, 2007</br>
           </div>
The <tt>arch</tt> directory in the kernel source tree contains all of the
architecture-specific code.  There is a lot of code there, despite years of
work by the development community to make things generic whenever
possible.  There are currently 26 different top-level architectures
supported by Linux, many of which contain a number of sub-architectures.
Two of those top-level architectures are i386 (the original Linux architecture)
and x86_64, which is the 
64-bit big brother to i386.  There is quite a bit of commonality between
those two architectures, and some efforts have been made to share code
between them whenever possible.  Even so, the source trees for the two
architectures remain distinct from each other.
<p>

In the view of some developers, at least, the separation of the two
architecture trees is a problem.  A bug fix which must be applied to one
often is applicable to the other, but it's not clear that all fixes are
being made in both places.  New features, too, must be added twice.  It is
relatively easy to break one architecture while working on the other.
Developers working on architecture-specific projects - virtualization is
mentioned often - end up having to do a lot of work to keep up with two
strongly related trees.  In response to this kind of pressure, the 32-bit
and 64-bit PowerPC architectures were merged into a single architecture
tree in 2.6.15, and the general consensus seems to be that it was a good
move.  But no such merger has happened for the x86 variants. 
<p>

That may be about to change, though: Thomas Gleixner and Ingo Molnar
recently posted <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/242439/">a patch to merge the two
architectures</a> with a request for comments.  This patch is huge: it
weighs in at over 9MB and touches 1764 files.  It is so tied to the current
state of the kernel tree that it can only be reasonably applied to one
specific commit point in the git repository.  This is not the patch which
is meant to be applied, though; its purpose is to show what the final
result would look like.  If and when the time comes to actually merge this
patch, it will be done differently:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	As a next step we plan to generate a gradual, fully bisectable,
	fully working switchover from the current code to the fully
	populated arch/x86 tree. It will result in about 1000-2000 commits.
</div>
<p>
That is a little intimidating as well.  Knowing this, the developers of
this patch have gone out of their way to make it possible to apply the
change with a high level of confidence.  So there will be no code changes
associated with the merger: it will be possible to build the exact same
kernel image from the source tree before and after the change.  
<p>

The patch creates a new architecture called <tt>x86</tt> and moves
everything from the two existing architectures over.  In the small number
of cases where each architecture has an identical copy of the same file,
only a single file is created in the new tree.  More often, though, the two 
architectures have a file by the same name in the same place, but their
contents differ.  In such cases, both files are moved into the new tree
with a <tt>_32</tt> or <tt>_64</tt> suffix, depending on where it came
from.  So, for example, both architectures contain
<tt>kernel/ioport.c</tt>; the new <tt>x86</tt> architecture has
<tt>ioport_32.c</tt> and <tt>ioport_64.c</tt>.  Some simple trickery is
then employed to ensure that the correct files for the target architecture
are built.
<p>

In many (if not most) cases, there is a great deal of common code in the
two files, and that common code is left there.  The idea at this stage of
the game is to get the two architecture trees together without affecting
the resulting kernel; that is probably the only way that such a big change
would ever be accepted.  Once things have been merged, the opportunities
for eliminating duplicated code between individual files will become more
apparent - the files will usually be right next to each other.  One
imagines that an army of code janitors would swoop in to do this work, much
of which would be relatively straightforward.  Once it's done, we would
have a shiny new, merged architecture with duplicated code squeezed out,
and everybody would be happy.
<p>

Or maybe not.  Andi Kleen has <a href="/Articles/243714/">expressed his
opposition</a> to this change:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think it's a bad idea because it means we can never get rid of
	any old junk. IMNSHO arch/x86_64 is significantly cleaner and
	simpler in many ways than arch/i386 and I would like to preserve
	that. Also in general arch/x86_64 is much easier to hack than
	arch/i386 because it's easier to regression test and in general has
	to care about much less junk. And I don't know of any way to ever
	fix that for i386 besides splitting the old stuff off completely.
</div>
<p>
Andi, by virtue of being the maintainer of the i386 and x86_64
architectures, has a relatively strong voice in this discussion.  His core
argument - that splitting the architectures allows lots of legacy issues to
be confined to the i386 tree - reflects a common practice in kernel code
management.  Code which only supports relatively new hardware tends to be a
lot cleaner than code which handles older devices as well, but removal of
support for hardware which is still in use is frowned upon.  So, instead, a
new subsystem is created for the newer stuff, with the idea that the legacy
code can be supported separately until it withers away.  A classic example
is the way that serial ATA support was implemented within its own subsystem
instead of being an addition to the IDE code.  Andi, along with a few
others, argues that x86-family processor support should be handled in the
same way.
<p>

Most of the participants in the early discussion would appear to disagree
with Andi, though.  Unlike legacy IDE devices, it is argued, the 32-bit
architecture is not going to disappear anytime soon.  The number of quirks
which are truly unique to the i386 architecture is seen as being relatively
small.  Linus <a href="/Articles/243718/">argues</a> that it's easier to
carry forward legacy code when it's part of a shared tree than when it's
shoved off into a corner.  Judging from the conversation which followed the
initial posting, there is a near-consensus that the unified tree is the
right way to go. 
<p>

There were a couple of suggestions that the patch could go directly into
2.6.23, but it is probably just as well that things did not happen that
way.  2.6.23 has a lot of new stuff already, and this patch is new.
Allowing a cycle for the work to age can only be helpful.  Besides, we have
not yet seen a repository with those 1000 or so separate commits in it.
<p>

More to the point, though: the real
discussion on the merger has not yet happened.  To rework two architectures
into one over the objections of the maintainer would be an extraordinary
step verging on a hostile takeover of the code.  Maintainers do not have
absolute veto power over patches, but overriding a maintainer on a patch
this big is not something which is done lightly.  So the developers of the
unified x86 architecture patch have one big challenge remaining: they have
solved the technical issues nicely, and they have convinced much of the
development community that this change should be made.  But it would be in
the best interests of everybody involved if they could find a way to
convince the maintainer of the code they are working with as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Conceptually, I love this patch.  It's easy to see why a lot of other maintainers like it.  So it may seem strange that Andi opposes it.  Going back in history, Andi has almost always objected to x86 (-32 or -64) patches that he believed would result in the archs requiring more effort to maintain--which seems a perfectly reasonable attitude, yes?  In this case, he clearly feels the "old cruft" will make it harder to keep the x86-64 codebase "pure".  In fact, independent of anything else, he <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118420191410205">really wants to get rid of</a> NUMAQ/Voyager/P5-SMP/visws support, saying "those [users] could continue using old kernels".
<p>
Now, it's not new to see the tired old "legacy users should use legacy kernels" argument trotted out again.  Anyone who has followed lkml for awhile knows that over the years, Linus and others have repeatedly, and vehemently, shot it down every time it comes up.  Usually, though, it's brought up by a newbie posting to lkml; I don't remember the last time a major maintainer argued for this, and it frankly worries me.
<p>
I love the fact that Linux is willing to support just about any hardware or filesystem.  Indeed, over the years many maintainers have stated that adding all the weird stuff forces them to think outside the box and come up with better abstractions, and that the end result is in fact code that is better designed, more elegant (and sometimes actually more performant) than if the code were excised of all that "legacy cruft".
<p>
When support for a feature *is* removed, it's almost always because it's started to bitrot, and nobody is willing to step up and resurrect it--but there's always the possibility of bringing it back sometime in the future (see the thread about <a href="http://marc.info/?t=118579645500005">removing the arm26 port</a> for a recent example).
<p>
In the end, I think it comes down to what the role of a maintainer is.  <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118420191410205">Andi</a>, on dealing with the potential difficulties of the arch merge: "I must admit I prefer hacking on new code instead".  The higher up the maintainership ladder you go, though, the less time there is for lots of personal hacking.  Linus and Andrew are primarily patch integrators at this point; they don't have the time to engage in major personal hacking any more.  Most of the major subsystem maintainers are similar (although they do have more time than Linus or Andrew, and they do still get some of their own hacking in).  So avoiding the stickier problems in one's maintainership bailiwick because of a preference to hack, while understandable, isn't really the maintainer's job.
<p>
Andi has also recently been taken to task several times for questionable code or decisions--it's been most noticeable to me over the last six months or so, but you can see indications in posts even further back.  The most recent I can recall at the moment is the breakage caused by commit 19d36ccdc34f5ed444f8a6af0cbfdb6790eb1177, which Linus commented upon <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118546915308104">thusly</a>:

<blockquote>I think it shows a total lack of taste and understanding, and I'm totally tired of it. This has happened too many times.<p></p>Andi: please don't send this patch *ever* again.</blockquote>

Personally, I think Andi is a gifted hacker.  I have no complaints there.  But I have to wonder if the maintainer's robes are still comfortable for him.  He seems to chafe at some of the responsibilities that are expected of maintainers, and this does seem to have lead to some less than optimal decisions.  It may be that he would be a more valuable contributor--and personally happier--if he handed the responsibility to someone else.  Unfortunately, maintaining x86 is not at all easy, and there are very few qualified for the position.  It's a difficult problem.

      If IDE/SATA is the ideal model, it's worth noting that, while "IDE" is going away, it's partially being replaced with "PATA" which is a different name for the same thing, but is the name under which libata supports it. And, aside from exceptionally lost devices, libata is getting support for all of the old IDE devices (as well as new devices; optical drives still seem to be routinely PATA, even when the hard drives are SATA).<br>
<p>
This would suggest that the correct thing to do is to rename x86_64 to x86, make it not use files out of i386 and add support for 32-bit processors to it, starting with non-quirky ones and progressively filling in weirder stuff in ways that doesn't impact the regular code. Then i386 is made obsolete when x86 handles everything. This would probably take some time, but probably not any longer than PATA, which seems to be coming along, and the switch will be easier on users (since they won't have their root partition device's major and minor change on them in the process).<br>

      I was thinking a similar thing, tho oss -&gt; alsa was the first thing that came to mind for me.  Think the heathrow controller on my Mac G3 is one of the few drivers left to be ported to libata.<br>

      there is a difference though.. the ide code was old and crufty and barely alive (although Bart did and the people before him did a good job to keep it breathing).<br>
<p>
both i386 and x86_64 are in a relatively good shape, so picking one isn't per se the right move; the proposed method allows for picking the best of either worlds on a per component basis. Sometimes x86_64 is better (for example around change_page_attr() code), sometimes i386 is better (timer/event handling as used by tickless).<br>
<p>
For ide/libata-pata it would be an extremely one-sided deal, not worth it. For this one.... it also allows for a much more gradual change, with each step bisectable, testable and debuggable (something the ide-&gt;libata move isn't either; for good reason since the starting point would have been nasty).<br>

      The whole point of merging is to make it less pain for the developers.<br>

      It sounds like it's both:  It's probably more short term pain for more long term advantage.<br>

      How does this affect users at all beyond the code quality issues that the developers also care about?<br>
<p>
It's not like the issue is visible from userspace.<br>

When I install a new kernel version, all my machines will use the same file name for the image:
<br><br>
/usr/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage<br><br>

Not very signifigant, I agree, but still a userspace-visible change.

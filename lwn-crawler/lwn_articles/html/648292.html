"Writeback" is the process of writing dirty pages in memory back to
permanent storage.  It is a tricky job; the kernel must arbitrate the use
of limited I/O bandwidth while ensuring that the system is not overwhelmed
by dirty pages.  Some years ago, writeback was a perennial discussion topic
at gatherings of memory-management developers; the kernel did not do as
good a job as anybody would have liked.  Those problems have, for the most
part, been solved in recent years — until one adds control groups into the
mix.  A solution to that problem is in the works, though, and should be
hitting the mainline in the near future.
<p>
Tejun Heo took some time to discuss the current situation during his
LinuxCon Japan talk.  The memory-management subsystem will, by default, try
to limit dirty pages to a maximum of 15% of the memory on the system.
There is a "magical function" called <tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt> that
will, if need be, throttle processes dirtying a lot of pages in order to
match the rate at which pages are being dirtied and the rate at which they

<a href="/Articles/648306/"><img

align="right"></a> 

can be cleaned.  It works reasonably well in current kernels, but it only
operates globally; it is not equipped to deal with control groups.
<p>
On the control group side, the memory controller can regulate the amount of
memory that is available to any given group, while the block controller is
in charge of regulating I/O bandwidth use.  Writeback is clearly related to
both memory use and I/O bandwidth, but the control-group mechanism offers
no way to enable controllers to work together — so these two controllers
don't.  The result, Tejun said, is a "really sad situation."
<p>
The memory controller currently tags pages in memory with owner information
so that it knows which control group to charge for each page.  The block
controller is unable to use that information, though, so it has no way of
knowing which control group to charge for writeback I/O traffic.  So
control groups do not use the system's global throttling mechanism at all;
instead, there is a "hacky" mechanism built into the memory controller
itself that, according to Tejun, "does not throttle anything effectively."
It ignores the global dirty-page watermarks that control throttling and is,
he said, "completely broken."  There has been talk of fixing the situation
for at least five years but nothing has been done, leading to a certain
amount of frustration.
<p>
<h4>Fixing writeback in control groups</h4>
<p>
So Tejun set out to deal with the problem.  His approach is driven by the
idea that control-group features should not need completely new mechanisms
for their implementation — writeback control in control groups should use
the same mechanism that the system as a whole uses.  The global mechanism
should just be a degenerate form of the single-group case.
<p>
There are two structures involved in writeback control in the kernel.
<tt>struct backing_dev_info</tt> contains information about a specific
device to which dirty pages are being written; it tracks the observed I/O
bandwidth of the device and how it is being used.  The
<tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure, instead, regulates writeback activity in
particular.  There is currently a single <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure
for each <tt>backing_dev_info</tt> structure, and the separation of their
roles is somewhat fuzzy.  (Both of these structures are defined in <tt><a
href="/Articles/648296/">include/linux/backing-dev.h</a></tt>)
<p>
One of the first things Tejun's <a href="/Articles/645708/">control-group
writeback support patch set</a> does is to move more writeback-specific
information from <tt>struct backing_dev_info</tt> into the
<tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure.  That structure then 
goes from a single instance per device to one instance for each control
group, allowing for each group to be regulated separately.
<tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt> is changed to use the per-group
<tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure, as are other pieces of the
writeback-control mechanism.  Tejun described it as being mostly "a giant
plumbing job."
<p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<p>
The completion of that plumbing job allows the block bandwidth controller
to regulate writeback I/O, but it is missing an important piece: the
throttling of processes that are dirtying more memory than can be cleaned
within their group's I/O bandwidth limits.  Or, more precisely, while the
system can throttle processes when the global dirty-page limit is reached,
it cannot throttle those that have dirtied too much of the memory that is
available to their specific control group.  Solving that problem is the
subject of <a href="/Articles/645707/">a separate patch set</a> adding
per-group throttling.
<p>
This patch set adds a new structure (<tt>struct wb_domain</tt>) for the
control of dirty-page throttling.  There is one global domain that
implements the "15% of total memory" limit that exists in current kernels.
Each control group gets its own <tt>wb_domain</tt> structure as well, to
enforce limits specific to that group.  When the memory-management code
computes the number of pages that a process within a specific group is
allowed to dirty, it looks at both the global and per-group
<tt>wb_domain</tt> structures and uses the more restrictive of the two.  A
process 
will never be allowed to exceed the number of dirty pages allowed to its
control group, but that limit may be lowered if the system as a whole has a
lot of dirty pages.
<p>
That is still not a complete solution to the problem, though.  The
writeback mechanism uses the inode (open file) as its fundamental unit of
control, while the memory controller applies limits on a per-page basis.
Tejun explained that each makes sense within its own context, but there is
a mismatch between the two that makes it harder to make those mechanisms
work well together.
<p>
The writeback mechanism is designed to focus on a single inode at a time;
among other things, writing out all of a single file's dirty pages together
tends to improve disk I/O locality.  When the I/O bandwidth controller
first sees writeback activity for an inode, it assigns "ownership" of the
inode to the control group responsible for that activity.  Thereafter, all
writeback activity for that inode is charged to that control group,
regardless of who actually dirtied the pages.  Tejun looked into making the
accounting more fine-grained but, he said, the result was far too complex
and wasn't worth it.  In the end, one control group is usually responsible
for the majority of writeback traffic to any given file.
<p>
There is still a problem, though, that the initial assignment of
responsibility for any given file might be incorrect.  Or the file could
move from one control group to another over time.  In either case, the
result could be that one group finds itself charged for large amounts of
writeback created by another group entirely.
<p>
To resolve that issue, Tejun has posted <a href="/Articles/645706/">yet
another patch set</a> adding "foreign cgroup inode bdi_writeback
switching."  This mechanism watches the ownership of the pages (as tracked
by the memory controller) being written back to each inode.  Using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer-Moore_Majority_Vote_Algorithm">Boyer-Moore
majority vote algorithm</a>, it decides which control group is responsible
for the most I/O traffic.  If most traffic originates in a group other
than the owner of that inode, and that pattern holds for a period of time
(two seconds, in the current patch), the ownership of the inode will be
switched to the new "winner".  Over time, that mechanism should ensure that
writeback I/O traffic is charged correctly without adding the need to track
things on a sub-inode level.
<p>
As for the status of all this work: Tejun said that it works and is
currently slated for the 4.2 merge window.  That said, it is still
experimental and there are probably some issues to be shaken out.  At the
time  of
the talk, only the ext2 filesystem was supported; since then, <a
href="/Articles/648299/">ext4 support</a> has been posted as well.  Each
filesystem will require changes to support the new writeback mechanism, but
the changes tend to be quite small.  Getting those pieces into place should
not take too long; then, once this work stabilizes, another longstanding Linux
memory-management shortcoming should be no more.

This assumption, that the writeback feature in Linux, is bug free, may not be correct. At the bugzilla, people still report the same symptoms. I recently triggered the use case, and ran into the same problem. It is just that for most of the people on new gen hardware, the issue may not be easily seen, because newer drives (MTD) are faster.<br>

Interesting, this looks like a "magic number"... is this the root-cause of the "disk bufferbloat" issue? Where enough memory and a slow enough USB stick can slow the whole system down since the limit is defined in space instead of time - just like network bufferbloat.<br>
<p>
I imagine control groups could help a bit but wouldn't it even better to dynamically measure the device throughput and throttle processes based on latency=user experience? So users don't have to buy two systems: one to compile and another to browse the web.<br>

<p>Not quite accurate.  It's 15% of *available* memory - this includes free+reclaimable memory, but not anonymous (swappable) memory.</p>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 8, 2015</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2015-Embedded_Linux_Conference">ELC 2015</a>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="https://freedreno.github.io/">freedreno project</a> was
started by Rob Clark to create a free-software driver for the Adreno family
of GPUs, which are used by the Qualcomm Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC)
family.  He 
presented a status report on the project, along with some history and
future plans, at 
the <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference">Embedded
Linux Conference</a>, which was held in San Jose, CA, March 23-25.
</p>

<p> 
The Adreno 2xx, 3xx, and 4xx are all supported by freedreno.  The 2xx GPUs
support <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengles/">OpenGL&nbsp;ES</a>&nbsp;2.0, the 3xx devices support OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;3.0 and the embedded profile of <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a>&nbsp;1.1, while the Adreno
4xx GPUs support OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;3.1 (with the <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/ANDROID/ANDROID_extension_pack_es31a.txt">Android
Extension Pack</a>) and the full
profile of OpenCL&nbsp;1.2.  The 3xx is the first of the modern Adrenos,
Clark said, and the 4xx was announced with the Snapdragon 805 SoC, which is
the first Adreno to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a>&nbsp;11.
</p>

<p>
Adrenos have a tile-based renderer, though it is implemented differently
than other 
tile-based devices.
Adrenos have a relatively large internal memory for the tile buffer, either in
the GPU core itself (GMEM) or elsewhere on the SoC (OCMEM).  The
driver manages the tile buffers, including handling restore and resolve
operations 
(moving tile data between the CPU and GPU memory).  It also handles
partitioning the rendering target into tiles.  On Adreno 3xx and
later GPUs, the driver can decide to bypass the tile buffer to do immediate
rendering in certain scenarios.
</p>

<h4>Motivation and history</h4>

<p>
Clark got involved because of the lack of free drivers for various
Snapdragon-based boards that were becoming available.  Graphics progress
was being held back because the GPUs were all
locked down.  These days,
developers expect 
to have GPU acceleration available for user interfaces and other purposes,
but for these ARM boards, you were "left with Android or Android" for
driver choices.  Those drivers didn't come with source, so you couldn't
even recompile them.  There were some "clever hacks" like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybris_%28software%29">libhybris</a>, but "piling on more duct tape doesn't solve the issue". 
</p>

<a href="/Articles/639250/">

alt="[Rob Clark]" title="Rob Clark" width=200 height=300>
</a>

<p>
So in mid-2012 he decided to do something about it.  He was working for TI
at the time, so PowerVR-based GPUs (as used by TI) were off-limits.  He
found some hardware 
that had an Adreno 220 and started to reverse engineer it.  He began work
on a <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gallium/">Gallium</a> driver in November&nbsp;2012.  By early 2013,
he had most of the "normal stuff" working.  He could run GNOME Shell and
some games on the hardware.
</p>

<p>
One of the nice things about a Gallium driver, Clark said, is that it
supports both desktop graphics and GL&nbsp;ES.  Lots of games are not ported
to GL&nbsp;ES but can still be played using the Gallium driver.
</p>

<p>
That early work was done mostly in the evenings and on weekends, but that
changed somewhat when he joined the Red Hat graphics team in
February&nbsp;2013.  While his freedreno work is not his full-time job, he
does get some work time to do freedreno development.
</p>

<p>
In March&nbsp;2013, he ordered a Nexus&nbsp;4, which has an Adreno 320 GPU, and
started looking at that.  Everything had changed between the two Adreno
revisions, including the shader instruction set and the registers.  Adreno 2xx
support was working well at that point, so it has pretty much been left
behind.  By mid-2013, he had Adreno 3xx support working at a basic level.
</p>

<p>
The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for the MSM (Mobile Station
Modem, a Qualcomm hardware designation that is used as the Adreno driver name)
devices was 
merged into the mainline in 
August&nbsp;2013 for the 3.12 kernel, which provided a "nice platform" for
further development work.  In January&nbsp;2014, he added hardware binning
support, which is a 
pre-pass made on the triangles to be rendered to see which fit in each
tile.  That sped up rendering so that he was able to get a "fairly
playable" 30 frames per second (fps) in <a href="http://www.xonotic.org/">Xonotic</a>.
</p>

<p>
He also started work on a new shader compiler in early 2014.  The earlier
compiler had just translated <a href="http://gallium.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tgsi.html">TGSI</a> directly to native instructions, but
didn't do proper instruction scheduling.  Adding that scheduling fixed a
number of problems while also giving a big performance boost, he said. 
</p>

<p>
He started work on OpenGL 2.0 and 2.1 support in May&nbsp;2014.  Xonotic supports
both OpenGL&nbsp;1.0 and 2.0, so it can easily be used to test the changes
made for 2.0 support.   

<p>
In perhaps something of a surprise move, Qualcomm posted the first patches
for the hardware in 
June&nbsp;2014.  The initial patches were for display support, but
subsequent patches were for the DRM/MSM driver itself.  Clark strongly commended
Qualcomm for doing that work upstream.
</p>

<p>
In mid-2014, he got his hands on his first Adreno 4xx device (an <a
href="http://mydragonboard.org/ifc6540/">Inforce6540</a> with an Adreno 420).  He found that
nearly all of the registers had all changed again, which required another
round of reverse engineering to figure them out.  The shader instruction
set was quite similar to that of the 3xx, so he was able to share that code
between the two GPU versions.
</p>

<p>
By October 2014, 90% of the <a
href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~nh/piglit/">Piglit</a> OpenGL tests
were passing for the Adreno 3xx.   Piglit is useful to test "weird corner
cases", he said.  It is often the case that games will work fine, but lots
of Piglit tests still fail.
</p>

<p>
Kernel driver patches to enable the 4xx were submitted by Qualcomm in
November&nbsp;2014 for the 3.19 kernel, which was another big step for the
company.  The initial Gallium support for 
the 4xx was also released around the same time.  As of February&nbsp;2015,
the 4xx support is behind where the 3xx is, but most games and other
programs are largely working at this point.  By March&nbsp;2015, the new
shader compiler was able to handle everything that the old compiler could,
so the old one has been retired.
</p>

<p>
The architecture for freedreno is much the same as for the Intel, Radeon, or
Nouveau drivers.  There are multiple user-space pieces (Gallium driver, X
video driver, and libdrm_freedreno) that talk to the kernel driver.  By
implementing it that way, they got Wayland support for free.  GNOME
Shell works just fine on Adreno hardware using the Wayland compositor.
</p>

<p>
Clark said that he doesn't know much about the Android graphics stack.  He
would like to see Android support free graphics for Adreno devices, but
that requires further investigation.
</p>

<h4>User space</h4>

<p>
The biggest single component of an open-source graphics driver is the
Gallium driver, he said.  The freedreno Gallium driver has a common core
that handles tasks like dirty state and buffer tracking, tile-buffer
management, and fences (i.e. synchronization operations).  There are also
separate components (fd2, fd3, and 
fd4) to handle each generation of Adreno devices, as well as a shader
compiler (ir3) that is shared between 3xx and 4xx devices.
</p>

<p>
The user-space piece of freedreno builds up a command stream that has lots
of register references.  That gets sent to the kernel driver, which is a
"glorified register writer", Clark said.  The shader compiler is the single
largest piece of the user-space driver.  He also went into some details of
the <a
href="https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki/Adreno-tiling">tiling
implementation</a> and how <a
href="https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki/Queries">queries</a>
(e.g. occlusion queries) are handled by the driver and the hardware.
</p>

<p>
Turning to debugging, Clark said that the <tt>FD_MESA_DEBUG</tt>
environment variable is the most useful technique for debugging.
This command:
<pre>
    $ FD_MESA_DEBUG=help glxinfo
</pre>
will produce a help message that lists other values for the environment
variable.  Another useful tool is <a
href="https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace">apitrace</a>, which will save
all of the GL commands into a trace file.  That file can be used to
reproduce some problem entirely separate from the program that produced the
output.  Command-stream traces can also be grabbed from the kernel driver
(using the <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/rd</tt> file). 
</p>

<p>
The envytools from the Nouveau project were used to generate header files
that describe the Adreno registers for both the Gallium and DRM/MSM kernel
driver.  As he figures out the registers of the GPUs, Clark enters them into
an XML file that is used by other tools, both to create the headers and to
decode various kinds of trace files.  For example, cffdump can decode the
command-stream trace files from both the free and binary blob drivers to
compare the output of each.  Information about the tools
used to reverse engineer the GPUs is <a
href="https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki/Reverse-engineering-tools">available</a> on the freedreno wiki.
</p>

<h4>GL/GL&nbsp;ES 3.0</h4>

<p>
There is a lot of work going on "behind the scenes" to enable
GL/GL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;3.0, Clark said.  A lot of the
work to do so has been done by Ilia Mirkin.  Supporting 3.0
will enable more games to work and will provide more advanced rendering
features.  Clark has also done work on the shader compiler to support the
new version of 
the <a
href="https://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/">GLSL</a> shader language.
</p>

<p>
For GL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;3.0, the "big ticket item" that is left to do is to implement
<a href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transform_Feedback">transform
feedback</a> and <a href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Uniform_Buffer_Object">uniform buffer objects</a> (UBOs).  For those, the
reverse engineering has been done, all that's left is to "write code".
The code for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Render_Targets">multiple render
targets</a> (MRTs) exists on a branch, but has not yet been merged.  There
is also some shader compiler work to support advanced flow control, but that is
not used in games much.
</p>

<p>
Support for the <a
href="https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/conditional_render.txt">NV_conditional_render</a>
extension is the biggest piece left for GL&nbsp;3.0 support.  Clark said
that the extension could be called the "we hate tilers" extension, since
handling it will perform badly on a tile-based GPU.
</p>

<p>
The shader compiler is already the biggest piece of the user-space driver,
but it will be getting somewhat bigger to handle some of these new
features.  Clark has started documenting the <a
href="http://gallium.readthedocs.org/en/latest/drivers/freedreno/ir3-notes.html">compiler
design</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki/A3xx-shader-instruction-set-architecture">Adreno
instruction set architecture</a>.  He has also has some preliminary work
toward supporting the <a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2014-December/072761.html">new
internal representation</a> (NIR), which is an Intel effort aimed at a new
shader compiler IR for better optimization.  He has a TGSI to NIR
translation patch, but it is not ready to land yet.
</p>

<p>
Getting the freedreno driver should be easy, since all of the pieces are
already upstream.  Distributions generally already have it enabled.  He
recommends Mesa&nbsp;10.4.x for Adreno 3xx devices and 10.5.1 (or higher)
for 4xx GPUs.
</p>

<p>
As with most free-software projects, freedreno could use some help.  To
start with, if a distribution doesn't have the driver enabled, help make
that happen, he suggested.  Bug reports are also welcome.  For those
interested in 
actually working on the driver, there is help needed in "everything from
the kernel to compilers".  For those that know GL/GL&nbsp;ES, adding more tests
would be helpful as well.
</p>

<p>
Clark described the process of reverse engineering a bit in answer to a
question from the audience.  He will start with a simple GL program that
draws a "quad" (a four-sided polygon), then he will change the frame buffer
size to see what the blob driver does differently.  As he sees different
registers and values, he records what he finds in the XML file that is used
by cffdump and other tools.  He runs a series of tests, just varying one
parameter at a time to see what changes and slowly works out all of the
registers.   For the most part, these tests are rendered off-screen as he
doesn't actually care much about what the output looks like.

Given that adreno3xx+ support immediate mode rendering (to some degree) is this really that bad?

Well, at least for a3xx the immediate mode (gmem bypass) is only for when blending/depth/stencil are not required.  So probably little overlap between that case and use of NV_conditional_render.<br>

Well... that's a rather limited number of scenarios. I'm sure it's useful but now I know why Qualcomm didn't specify that the immediate mode wasn't functionally complete.<br>
Perhaps it's mostly used for chrome elements.<br>

yeah, mostly for UI type stuff (and texture upload, mipmap level generation, etc)<br>
<p>
I guess it would have cost too many transistors, relative to the usefulness, to make it functionally complete.<br>

Here is a video (by Nicolas Charbonnier) with Rob Clark, <br>
invited by Qualcomm to show off the freedreno driver at an exhibition,<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_-VKM_hPbA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_-VKM_hPbA</a><br>

It is great that Qualcomm is appreciating the work and it may get others to open-up their GPU drivers. <br>

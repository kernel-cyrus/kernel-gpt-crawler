<h1>Securely renting out your CPU with Linux</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 26, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
One might think that hacking kernels for SuSE would be enough to keep a
person busy, but Andrea Arcangeli has more energy than that.  So, on the
side, he is working on a project called <a
href="http://www.cpushare.com/">cpushare</a>.  Essentially, it is
a form of Linux-based worldwide grid network which would enable people to
sell their idle CPU cycles to others who are in need of serious crunching
power.  Most systems sit idle most of the time; they might as well be
working for a living instead.
<p>

Before Linux users will accept outside code on their systems, they will
need to be pretty well convinced that said code can be kept under control.
Without some pretty fierce security, a grid network could quickly be turned
into a serious zombie network, and that would be embarrassing for everybody
involved.  The long-term plan is to take advantage of "trusted computing"
hardware to sandbox the guest code; that hardware will also be able to help
prevent the owner of the system from interfering with (or even observing)
the buyer's computations and data.  For now, however, some other method of
ensuring the security of the host systems will have to be devised.
<p>

Andrea's answer is the <a href="/Articles/120192/">seccomp patch</a>.  It
is, in fact, an exceedingly simple solution to the problem.  With this
patch in place, the kernel allows a process to make a one-way transition
into a "secure computing" mode.  A hook is placed in the system call gate
which checks for this mode; when secure computing is turned on, an attempt
to execute almost any system call will result in the immediate termination
of the process.  The only exceptions are <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>,
<tt>exit()</tt>, and the two forms of <tt>sigreturn()</tt>.  So the
cpushare client would execute outside work by setting up some sockets to
communicate with the master system, turning on the secure mode, and
executing the client code.  If all goes well, that code will be able to do
nothing beyond pure CPU use and communicating through the sockets given to
it.  And exiting, of course.
<p>

The objection that was raised is that this sort of sandboxing can be done
from user space with <tt>ptrace()</tt>.  At least, it can if <a
href="/Articles/120680/">one little patch</a> is applied to ensure that the
sandboxed process cannot continue if, somehow, the monitoring process dies
first.  Andrea <a href="/Articles/120681/">acknowledges</a> that the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> solution is workable, but he still prefers the secure
computing mode.  The reason is simplicity: the seccomp patch is quite
small, and it is relatively easy to verify that it does what is needed.
The <tt>ptrace()</tt> code is rather more complex and harder to verify,
even before considering the interactions with the user-space monitor.
<p>

The public discussion was inconclusive, so it is hard to predict whether
this patch will eventually be accepted or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      To me the patch sounds like something that could have lots of other
uses besides renting CPU:s. For example, it might enable a secure
"ActiveX-like" native code plug-in system for browsers (or other extendable
apps). The plug-in would communicate only through file descriptors open
at the time it is called, and would be completely unable to mess with
anything else (unlike a Windows ActiveX control).

      I see multiple uses: it could be an effective sandbox mechanism for things that have can work over a pipe. Could be as complex as a PDF or PostScript renderer even.<br>

      Exactly.  Add some read/write-related syscals (epool, select, pool, shutdown,  fseek and friends, ioctl, mmap of already open FDs...), plus signal handling, and this code would really be useful to create worker children that simply cannot step outside of their very strict bounds.  <br>
<p>
Give it two security levels (the first one does not give access to seek, ioctl or mmap, or any other non-socket operations), and it would still be useful for grid computing.<br>
<p>
It is a pretty exiting idea, overall. AND it is something we can use everywhere when available easily, unlike SELinux.<br>

      What you are talking about are actually "Process based access controls" that implement a security policy on a per-process basis.<br>
I do think that it is great to have something like that in the kernel, but the present patch is a bit crude. (Can it run an embedded Acrobat Reader in a browser-controlled sandbox?) We'll need some discussion about the design and desired functionality.<br>

      An excellent idea for a department full of fat clients:<br>
instead of letting them sit idle when there is work to<br>
be done, let them contribute to it.<br>
<p>
Natural extensions to this might include<br>
- find-grained capabilities, and a command to<br>
  set a selected subset of them<br>
- a fair-share scheduler, or at least one with<br>
  a "use CPU only when no other process wants<br>
  it" scheduling class.<br>

      To be more generally useful, the process probably wants access to other system calls that simply access file descriptors, e.g. poll(). Passing file descriptors might also be desirable. Architectures with vsyscalls can do gettimeofday() from user space, but not every architecture implements it.<br>
<p>
The great virtue of Andrea's mechanism is that it is rather difficult to get read()/write() wrong -- there's little in the way of syscall argument processing, with potential fence-post errors, etc.<br>
<p>
But to provide additional functionality, one needs to implement an RPC mechanism to a managing process (talking over some file descriptor passed to the secured process) anyway, in which case one has to ask, which is more secure?  As soon as the number of "RPC-like" services provided by the manager process multiplies, one has to worry about security in the manager process.<br>

      This is also one of the features that OpenSolaris 10 is supposed to be spearheading.. a secure way of doing grid computing. It is probably patented 10 ways from Sunday for such a simple thing.<br>

      I would hate to see this be a special purpose thing, when the existing Linux capability concept fits it so well.  Require certain capabilities to do all those forbidden system calls, and then exec the tenant program without those capabilities.

      Linux comes up with his idea to drasticly speed up pipes (along with the splice and tee capabilities) and Andrea comes up with his idea to lock down processes to only be able to access open fd's (like pipes)<br>

      I can definitely see this being useful for grid computing and I could see myself deploying this in my environment. <br>
<p>
Sure you could probably use some SELinux arrangement, but this is vastly simpler. It remindes me of systrace but assumes even less as far as profiling the app in question. Right up front it defines the limitations. Work within it, or leave. <br>
<p>
As grid computing spreads and more projects take advantage of the significant amount of computing out there for inter project work this could be very useful to provide a simple yet effective way to sandbox grid processes. <br>
<p>
When I say computing, I do not mean peoples desktops. Sure they can be used for some projects, but combine multi-gigabit networking with hundreds of nodes in a cluster with terabytes of storage and the domain of problems you can tackle grows fast. There are hundreds of small 100-500 Teraflop scale clusters out there that can be connected to maximize their utilization and techniques like this are just what is required to increase they security. <br>

      I can see how this could be `secure' for those supplying the CPU power.<br>
<p>
But how can you ever trust the results of the calculations?<br>

      Interesting question. It depends on the nature of the computation that you   
are doing, I suppose. There are lots of computations that are easier to   
check than to do. Division is a good example.   
<p>   
A related, and more tricky question, is whether or not you could ever do   
computation on someone's computer without them being able to know what you   
are doing.   
<p>   
You can do certain operations on remote computers with a degree of safety.   
For instance, you can store data on a distributed file system, if you   
encrypt it.   
<p>   
For more traditional computation it is difficult to know what it is   
possible to hide or not. If you wanted someone to do work for you, but not   
know what they were doing, you can take steps. Getting back to division,   
you could multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same amount,   
and know that the results of the division would be the same. The person   
doing the work for you would have no way to know which two numbers you are   
dividing, and still be able to give you a result you can use. Plus you can   
check it when you get the result back.   
<p>   
Of course, the person doing this work will still know that division is   
being done, so the operation isn't completely transparent.   
<p>   
It gets trickier still when you are executing a series of operations. For   
instance, if you have a function that consists of a division followed by   
an addition, then you cannot simply scale the numbers as before.   
<p>   
I'm not sure what is possible and what isn't, only that *something* is   
possible. I've actually considered proposing this as a PhD topic and going   
back to school. <tt>:)</tt>

The <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2002/ols2002-pages-479-495.pdf">futex
[PDF]</a> mechanism, introduced in 2.5.7 by Rusty Russell, Hubertus Franke, and 
Mathew Kirkwood, is a fast, lightweight kernel-assisted locking 
primitive for user-space applications. It provides for very fast
uncontended lock acquisition and  
release. The futex state is stored in a user-space variable (an unsigned 
32-bit integer on all platforms). Atomic operations are used in order to 
change the state of the futex in the uncontended case without the 
overhead of a syscall. In the contended cases, the kernel is invoked to 
put tasks to sleep and wake them up.
<p>
Futexes are the basis of several mutual exclusion constructs commonly 
used in threaded programming. These include pthread mutexes, 
condvars, semaphores, rwlocks, and barriers. They have been through a 
lot of reconstructive and cosmetic surgery over the last several years, 
and are now more efficient, more functional, and better documented than 
ever before.
<p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>

While few application developers will use futexes directly, a cursory 
knowledge of how to do so is necessary to appreciate the improvements 
presented a bit later. By way of a simple example, futexes can be used 
to store the state of a lock and provide a kernel waitqueue for tasks 
blocking on the lock. To minimize syscall overhead, this state should 
allow for atomic lock acquisition when the lock is uncontended. The 
state could be defined as:
<p>
<ol start=0>
<li> unlocked
<li> locked
</ol>
<p>
In order to acquire the lock, an atomic test-and-set instruction (such 
as <tt>cmpxchg()</tt>) can be used to test for&nbsp;0 and set to&nbsp;1. In
this case, the  
locking thread acquires the lock without involving the kernel (and the 
kernel has no knowledge that this futex exists). When the next thread 
attempts to acquire the lock, the test for zero will fail and the kernel 
needs to be involved. The blocking thread can then use the <tt>futex()</tt>
system call with the FUTEX_WAIT opcode to put itself to sleep on the futex, 
passing the address of the futex state variable as an argument. To 
release the lock, the owner changes the lock state to zero (unlocked) and 
issues the FUTEX_WAKE opcode, which will wake the blocked thread to 
return to user space and try to acquire the lock (as described above). 
This is a an obviously trivial example with lots of room for 
optimization. Ulrich Drepper's "<a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/futex.pdf">Futexes are Tricky</a>" [PDF] is still the 
undisputed reference for using futexes to build locking primitives such 
as mutexes. It explores the many race conditions involved with using 
futexes as well as optimizations to improve on the example given here.
<p>
When the user threads call into the kernel with the <tt>futex()</tt> system
call, 
they pass the address of the futex state (uaddr), the opcode to perform 
(op), and various other arguments. The uaddr is used by the kernel to 
generate a unique "futex_key" to reference the futex. When a thread 
requests to block on a futex, as with FUTEX_WAIT, a "futex_q" is created 
and queued in the "futex_queues" hash table. There is one futex_q for 
every task blocked on a futex, possibly many futex_q's per futex. The 
futex_queues themselves (the hash table lists, not the "futex_q's") are 
shared among futexes, since multiple futex_keys will hash to the same 
queue. These relationships are illustrated below:
<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/dvh-futexes.png" width=703 height=399
alt="[Futex diagram]">
<p>
In most cases, there is no policy defining how the user space state 
variable is to be used (despite what the futex man pages may or 
may not say). The application (or a library such as glibc) uses this 
value to define the state of the locking construct being implemented. 
This can be as simple as a boolean variable (as in the example above), 
however optimized implementations and other locking mechanisms require 
more complex state values.
<p>
In addition to the simple FUTEX_WAIT and FUTEX_WAKE operations, the 
kernel also manages special operations that require more knowledge of 
the locking construct's state than can be had in user space, most 
notably the priority inheritance (PI) chains and robust lists. PI and 
robust futexes are exceptions to the user-defined-policy rule regarding 
the state variable. Their state depends not only on the locked state of 
the mutex, but also on the identity of the owner and whether or not 
there are waiters. As such, the futex value is defined as the thread 
identifier (TID) of the owner and a bit to indicate pending owners. This 
policy still allows for user space atomic operations to avoid calling 
into the kernel in the uncontended case.
<p>

<h4>Improvements</h4>

<p>
Futexes have seen numerous improvements from a handful of developers 
since their debut appearance in 2.5.7. Some notable improvements include 
priority based wake-up for real-time tasks (by Pierre Peiffer) and 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/172149/">robust</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/177111/">PI futexes</a> (by Ingo Molnar and Thomas Gleixner). 
These latter features have been in use for some time and have been 
adequately covered here on LWN.net as well as in the excellent 
discussions on the kernel mailing list. Your author's foray into futexes 
picks up here, about two and a half years ago. Aside from several fixes 
to address rare corner cases and race conditions, the futex code has 
seen several functional and performance improvements since those earlier 
contributions.
<p>
Significant effort went into reducing futex overhead. Eric Dumazet 
introduced <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/229668/">private futexes</a> as an optimization for 
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE pthread mutexes. Private futexes can only be 
used by threads of the same process. They are distinguishable from each 
other simply by their virtual address, while shared futexes have 
different virtual addresses in each process, requiring the kernel to 
lookup their physical address for unique identification. This 
optimization eliminates the use of the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore for
private futexes,  
reducing system-wide contention. It also eliminates the atomic 
operations used in reference counting for private futexes, resulting in 
less cache-line bouncing on SMP machines. Glibc now uses private futexes 
by default.
<p>
Peter Ziljstra further reduced the futex dependency on <tt>mmap_sem</tt> by 
using <tt>get_user_pages_fast()</tt> in the fast paths, making use of 
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, and pushing the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> locks down tightly
around the  
slow paths (September 2008). These changes had the added benefit of 
removing much of the virtual memory related logic from <tt>kernel/futex.c</tt>,
simplifying the code considerably. Due to their dependence on user space 
addresses, futexes are burdened with several possible fault points. 
Holding  <tt>mmap_sem</tt> complicated the fault logic since it had to be 
released prior to calling <tt>get_user()</tt>. With  <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
usage reduced,  
your author greatly simplified the fault logic (March 2009), resulting 
in far more legible code.
<p>
Bitset conditional wakeup was added by Thomas Gleixner (February 2008) 
in order to enable optimized rwlock implementations in glibc. 
FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET and FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET allow the user to specify a 
bitmask which limits the woken tasks to those which specified the same 
bitset (or a superset, such as FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY) at wait time.
<p>
Since the introduction of PI futexes, the glibc condvar implementation 
of <tt>pthread_cond_broadcast()</tt> (with a PI mutex) has been forced to wake 
all waiters, rather than take advantage of FUTEX_REQUEUE, due to the 
lack of support for requeueing to PI futexes. This leads to a wake-up 
storm as all the waiters race back to user space to contend for the 
lock. It also fails to ensure that the highest priority task acquires 
the lock first. Recent kernels (2.6.31-rt* and 2.6.32-rc*) now have your 
author's FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI patches (April 2009) which provide the 
kernel-side support for <a href="http://lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/papers/paper.10.html">requeueing waiters from a non-PI futex to a PI 
futex</a>. With glibc patches in the works by Dinakar Guniguntala, 
real-time applications will soon be able to use pthread condition 
variables with guaranteed wake-up order and fewer overall wake-ups.
<p>
<h4>Now What?</h4>

<p>
While there are several items that futex developers may consider in the 
future, they are hopeful that <tt>kernel/futex.c</tt> and all its
brain-bending,  
liver-killing insanity can be put to rest for at least a little while. 
However, since no article is complete without a list of next steps, the 
following items may receive some attention in the future:
<p>
Man pages: The current man pages do not include some of the new futex 
operations. They suggest a policy for the value of the futex which has 
led to some confusion regarding usage of futexes. Worst of all, the user 
space <tt>futex()</tt> definition has been removed from 
<tt>/usr/include/linux/futex.h</tt>, rendering the man pages not only
incomplete,  
but also inaccurate. Users of futexes must use the syscall interface 
directly.
<p>
Adaptive futexes: It is possible that some of the scheduling overhead of 
futexes can be reduced by some optional amount of spinning prior to 
going to sleep in the kernel. However, as futexes expose their state to 
user space, this spinning can also be done in user space, as is done 
with adaptive mutexes in glibc now, albeit without the knowledge of whether 
the owner is running, so spinning is reduced to a simple maximum-retries loop.
<p>
Interruptible futexes: There is some interest in interruptible blocking 
lock operations from large proprietary software projects. Futex 
operations currently restart themselves in the event of a signal, rather 
than returning -EINTR to user space. Futexes could be flagged with 
FUTEX_INTERRUPTIBLE which would be checked on signal-induced wakeup to 
determine if the syscall should be restarted or if -ECANCELED should be 
returned to user space. Exposing such a feature in the pthread locking 
primitives would involve non-POSIX compliant changes to the pthread 
library, but this is not without precedent.
<p>
Scalability enhancements: There has been some discussion on LKML 
regarding private as well as NUMA-optimized hash tables. The futex 
hash table is shared across all processes and is protected by spinlocks 
which can lead to real overhead, especially on large systems. This 
overhead is not serving any useful purpose if these systems are 
partitioned on NUMA nodes, or even for processes that use private 
futexes exclusively.
<p>
Futex test suite: Your author has been compiling a list of requirements 
for an exhaustive test suite to validate futex functionality. This 
test suite would serve as a regression suite for future development. The 
many corner cases and misuse cases possible with futexes complicate the 
test  suite and present a challenge to its design.

I don't know anything about Futexs etc, but given that the last few LWN articles have been along the lines of "The one big locking table was replaced with a per CPU table to increase scalability",  do we expect to have an article in a year's time that the Futex hash table is now one-per-cpu ?<br>

There has been more discussion along the lines of per-numa-node and per-<br>
process tables to reduce false-sharing on the futex hash table, but the <br>
effect is similar. One thing I feel is lacking a use-case that exemplifies <br>
the contention on the hash-table and any cache-ping-pong it may cause on <br>
multi-socket and/or multi-node systems. I'm working on a futex test suite <br>
now and I hope some of the perf and stress tests will help here.<br>

one real-world example of lock ping-pong with futexes that I ran into recently was rsyslog (whould be reduced in recent versions)<br>
<p>
it has threads that receive messages and add them to a (lock protected) queue, while other threads retrieve messages from the queue to output them.<br>
<p>
with a simple UDP input and file output a high enough input rate could push it into lock contention, at which point throughput plummets. I can't say for sure that this is SMP cach line bouncing, but there's a good chance of this being the case.<br>

<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
There has long been a desire for the ability to checkpoint a set of
processes (save their state to disk) and restore those processes at some
future time, possibly on a different system.  For almost as long, Linux has
lacked that feature, but those days are coming to an end.  Pavel Emelyanov
led a session during the 2013 Kernel Summit's plenary day to update the
audience on the status of this functionality.
<p>
Pavel started with the history of this feature.  <a
href="/Articles/375855/">Early attempts</a> to add checkpoint/restart went
with an entirely in-kernel approach.  The resulting patch set was large and
invasive; it looked like a maintenance burden and never got much acceptance
from the broader development community.  Eventually, some developers
realized that the APIs provided by the kernel were nearly sufficient to
allow the creation of a checkpoint/restore mechanism that ran almost

<a href="/Articles/572141/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/PavelEmelyanov-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Pavel Emelyanov]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

entirely in user space.  All that was needed was a few additions here and
there; as of the 3.11 kernel, all of those additions have been merged and
user-space checkpoint/restart works.  Live migration is supported as well.
<p>
Pavel had some requests for developers designing kernel interfaces in the
future.  Whenever new resources are added to a process, he asked, please
provide a call to query the current state.  A classic example is timers;
developers added interfaces to create and arm timers, but nothing to query
them, so the checkpoint/restart developers had to fill that in.  He also
requested that any user-visible identifiers exposed by the kernel not be
global; instead, they should be per-process identifiers like file
descriptors.  If identifiers must be global — he gave process IDs as an
example — it will be necessary to create a namespace around them so that
the same identifiers can be restored with a checkpointed process.
<p>
Now that the basic functionality works, some interesting new features are
being worked on.  One of these checkpoints all processes in the system, but
keeps the contents of their memory in place.  It then boots into a new
kernel with kexec and restores the processes quickly, using the saved
memory whenever possible.  This, Pavel said, is the path toward a seamless
kernel upgrade.
<p>
Andrew Morton expressed his amazement that all of this functionality works,
especially given that the checkpoint/restore developers added very little
in the way of new kernel code.  Is there, he asked, anything that doesn't
work?  Pavel responded that they have tried a lot of stuff, including web
servers, command-line utilities, huge high-performance computing
applications, and more.  Almost everything will checkpoint and restore just
fine.
<p>
Andrew then refined his question: could you write an application that is
not checkpointable?  The answer is "yes"; the usual problem is the use of
external resources that cannot be checkpointed.  For example, Unix-domain
sockets where one end is held by a process that is not being checkpointed
will block things; syslog can apparently be a problem in this regard.  Work
is being done to solve this problem for a set of known services; the
systemd folks want it, Pavel added.  Unknown devices are another
problematic resource; there is a library hook that can be used to add
support for specific devices if their state can be obtained and restored.
<p>
Beyond that, though, this long-sought functionality seems to work at last.

Yeah. I imagine it would be problematic if you checkpointed something using a network connection and the far end timed it out while it was checkpointed. (e.g., what happens if you checkpoint an X client? The X server will presume it dead after a fairly short time...)<br>
<p>
The 'checkpoint everything, kexec, and uncheckpoint' mechanism looks awesome. The sooner it works fully, the happier I'll be. It's a big hammer, unlike, say, ksplice, but it should work well enough. (Kernel modesetting probably helps here, since it is at least possible to checkpoint things like an X server, where before KMS that was a hopeless dream.)<br>

I was thinking about that and it seems a simple solution to just let the TCP connection be immediately reset by the remote side, the application should have some way of handling that in any case, checkpointing or not.<br>

I should have been more clear what I meant by the "remote side", I meant the remote end of the TCP connection.  If TCP can't recover it's no real loss because the network stack and application can handle dropped TCP connections without trouble.  You see the same thing when devices suspend and resume on another network segment.<br>

My X server disagrees -- or rather its connected clients do. X connection drops, oops you're dead.
<p>
For some sorts of TCP-connected application what you say is true -- but not for all, by any means.

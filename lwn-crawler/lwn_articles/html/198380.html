Paravirtualized systems are operating systems unto themselves - they look
like independent systems to the greatest extent possible.  In the end,
however, a paravirtualized system is still running under a host, and must
interact with that host.  A recent set of patches (entitled "<a
href="/Articles/198384/">guest page hinting</a>") shows how running
paravirtualized systems in a fully independent mode can hurt performance -
and the sorts of tricks which can be required to make things run more
efficiently.
<p>
Consider, for example, a short-lived application which runs on a guest
system.  That application may dirty a number of pages, then exit, its job
finished.  The guest system knows that the dirty pages are no longer in
use, and can be recycled.  From the host's point of view, however, the only
thing known is that the pages are dirty.  So the host will, if needs to
reclaim those pages, carefully write their (useless) data out to swap
first.  This is a wasted effort which would be nice to avoid.
<p>
The hinting patches add a couple of low-level primitives for use by guest
operating systems: <tt>set_page_unused()</tt> and
<tt>set_page_stable()</tt>.  The former marks a page as being unneeded by
the guest, while the latter marks the page as being in active use.  The
s/390 architecture (which is the main target for this patch set currently)
can implement these states through a pair of page flags which the guest can
set, making the operations fast.  Once pages have been marked as unused,
the host system can reclaim them with no further effort, making the whole
virtual memory subsystem more efficient.
<p>
The next step is to consider page cache pages.  These pages will contain
data from a file found on a storage device somewhere, meaning that they can
be recreated from the source if need be.  That, in turn, means that the
host could discard them in response to memory pressure.  But, once again,
the host knows nothing about the 
guests' page caches.  So the hinting patches add another state, called
"volatile," to mark pages with backing store.  When the host is feeling
memory pressure, it is 
free to discard volatile pages without saving their contents
first.  It must, however, make sure that the guest system knows that
this action has taken place so that the page can be removed from the
guest's page cache.  In the current patch set, this notification only works
for s/390 machines, however.
<p>

Pages which have been locked into memory pose an extra challenge here -
they can be part of the page cache, but they still shouldn't be taken away
by the host system.  So such pages cannot be marked as "volatile."  The
problem is that figuring out if a page is locked is harder than it might
seem; it can involve scanning a list of virtual memory area (VMA)
structures, which is slow.  So the hinting patches add a new flag to the
<tt>address_space</tt> structure to note that somebody has locked pages
from that address space in memory.  When the flag is set, those pages are
not marked as being volatile.
<p>

The swap cache also benefits from some hinting work - once the guest has written
a page to swap, that page has good backing store and can be grabbed by the
host system.  The approach taken is similar to that used with the page
cache, though there are a few extra details to take care of.  For example,
the guest must take care to have the page marked stable (and deal with its
potentially having been discarded by the host) before freeing the
associated entry in the swap area.
<p>

Attentive readers may have noticed that these patches are heavily oriented
toward the s/390 architecture.  IBM has, of course, been doing
virtualization for a very long time, so it is not surprising that some
relatively advanced virtualization patches are coming from that direction -
or that IBM's architectures are designed with virtualization in mind.
Other paravirtualization projects will encounter many of the same issues,
however, and may well benefit from this work.  So the next stage for this
patch set should be consideration by other projects and possible work to
make the hinting features more generally applicable.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Now imagine after that some other short-lived application runs on the guest. The guest has no trouble to identify which pages to re-use (they're still no longer in use). But as soon as the guest touches the page, the host will first go and reclaim the original contents from its paging devices. And while writing out the page could be seen as just a "waste" from the guest's point of view, bringing the page back in actually delays the guest.<br>
Needless to say that two stacked LRU mechanisms increase chances of this happening.<br>

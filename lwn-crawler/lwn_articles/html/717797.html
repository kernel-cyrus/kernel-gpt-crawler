"Cpusets" are a Linux kernel mechanism that enables control over which
processors a given process is allowed to run on.  The memory policy (or
"mempolicy") mechanism, instead, gives control over how a process's memory
is allocated across the nodes of a NUMA system.  As Vlastimil Babka
explained during the memory-management track of the 2017 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, these two mechanisms do not
always play well together, with some surprising and unfortunate
consequences.
<p>
Cpusets are an administrator-controlled mechanism; unprivileged processes
cannot normally change their CPU assignments.  Mempolicies, instead, are
under the control of the processes themselves.  If both mechanisms are used
together, one might logically expect that memory would be allocated on the
set of nodes defined by the intersection of the cpuset and the mempolicy.
If that intersection is empty, "then there is space for creativity".
But that is not what actually happens.
<p>
Babka put up <a href="/Articles/717801/">a pair of slides</a> showing what
can happen.  Imagine a process running on a four-node system; initially
both the cpuset and the mempolicy are set to nodes zero and one.  In this
case, memory will be allocated from either of those two nodes, as one might
expect.  If the cpuset is changed to nodes one and two, the memory
allocations will follow to those two nodes.  But, if the cpuset is first
reduced to a single node (node two in the example), then restored to the
original zero and one, the result will be allocations from node zero only;
the kernel will have lost track of the fact that the mempolicy called for
both nodes to be used.
<p>
This problem was understood and addressed in the 2.6.26 kernel through the
addition of a couple of flags to <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">the
<tt>set_mempolicy()</tt> system call</a>.  If the process sets its
mempolicy with the <tt>MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES</tt> flag, that policy will not
change when the cpuset is changed.  <tt>MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES</tt>,
instead, causes the policy to move along with cpuset changes while
remembering the original policy, so it will never exhibit the single-node
allocation behavior described above.
<p>
What happens if there is no intersection between the cpuset and the
mempolicy, as can happen, especially, with <tt>MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES</tt>?
The answer is that it will allocate memory from the cpuset nodes.  Kirill
Shutemov suggested that perhaps allocations should fail instead in that
circumstance, but that was deemed to be unfriendly behavior and an ABI
break as well.  It is better to allocate memory on the wrong node than to
kill an otherwise working program, especially if that program did work on
older kernels.  
In general, it was agreed, the <tt>set_mempolicy()</tt>
interface is broken, but it is going to be hard to fix now.
<p>
One serious problem with the current implementation is its behavior when
the cpuset is being changed, forcing the mempolicy to be changed as well.
There is a 
period of time during that change when an empty node list
causes the kernel to conclude that it is out of memory.  That can lead to
spurious invocations of the out-of-memory killer, an outcome that tends to
get a cold reception in the user community.
<p>
Fixing that problem seems necessary and urgent.  The mempolicy updates
associated with cpuset changes have to be maintained, since the alternative
is an ABI break.  For the static case, the solution is straightforward,
since the set of nodes will not change.  In the relative case, instead, the
remapping will need to be done on the fly; it is a solvable problem but the
solution looks complex.  There may be no workable fix for the default case.
<p>
The discussion focused on the details of how a fix might work for the
remainder of the session.  It may involve moving the list of allowed memory
zones back into the cpuset itself, which is how mempolicies were once
implemented many years ago.  The plan, as is so often the case, is to wait
for a patch to appear and see how the solution looks at that time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

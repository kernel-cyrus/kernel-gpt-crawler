The objective of most attacks on the kernel is to run code of the
attacker's choosing with kernel privileges.  It is thus unsurprising that
many hardening techniques are aimed at preventing attackers from putting
arbitrary code in places where a compromised kernel might be convinced to
run it.  Unfortunately, the design of the kernel's memory-management
subsystem makes it possible for many kernel access-prevention techniques to
be circumvented.  A patch set is circulating that attempts to close that
hole, but it brings an interesting question of its own: is the kernel
community now willing to take a performance hit for better security?
<p>
An attacker wanting to get the kernel to run arbitrary code faces a
problem: where can that code be put so that the kernel might run it?  If
the kernel can be convinced to run code found in user space, that problem
becomes much easier to solve, since placing code in user-space memory is
something that anybody can do.  Since user-space memory remains mapped
while the processor is running in kernel mode, all that needs to be done is
to convince the kernel to jump to a user-space address.  Years ago, it was
possible to simply map the page at address 0 and find a bug that would
cause the kernel to jump to a null pointer.  Such simple attacks have been
headed off, but more complex exploits are still common.
<p>
Obviously, the best solution is to ensure that the kernel will never try to
jump to a user-space address.  If one accepts that there will always be
bugs, though, it makes sense to add other defenses, such as simply
preventing the execution of user-space memory by the kernel.  The PaX
KERNEXEC and UDEREF mechanisms are designed to prevent this kind of
user-space access.  More recently, the processor manufacturers have gotten into
the game as well; Intel now has <a href="/Articles/517475/">supervisor mode
access prevention</a> and supervisor mode execute protection, while ARM has
added privileged execute-never.  On systems where these mechanisms are
fully implemented, it should be impossible for the kernel to execute code
found in user-space memory.
<p>
Except, as <a
href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vpk/papers/ret2dir.sec14.pdf">this paper
from Vasileios P. Kemerlis et al. [PDF]</a> points out, there's a
loophole.  User-space memory is accessed via a process's page tables, and
the various access-prevention mechanisms work to block kernel access via
those page tables.  But the kernel also maintains a linear mapping of the
entire range of physical memory (on 64-bit systems; the situation on 32-bit
systems is a bit more complicated).  This mapping has many uses within the
kernel, with page-level memory management being near the top of the list.
It provides a separate address for every physical page in the system.
Importantly, it's a kernel-space address and, on some systems (x86 before
3.9 and all ARM), this memory range is executable by the kernel.
<p>
If an attacker can cause the kernel to jump into the direct mapping, none
of the user-space access-prevention mechanisms will apply, even if the
target address corresponds to a user-space page.  So the direct mapping
offers a convenient way to bypass these protections, with only one little
catch: an attacker must be able to determine the physical address of the
page containing the exploit code.  As the paper points out, the
<tt>pagemap</tt> files under <tt>/proc</tt> will provide that information,
and, while these files can be disabled, distributions tend not to do that.
So, on most systems, everything is in place to enable an attacker to
exploit a bug that can cause a jump to an arbitrary address and the
existing access-prevention mechanisms are powerless to stop it.
<p>
(Life gets a little harder on current x86 kernels, where it is no longer
possible to directly execute code via the direct mapping.  In such cases,
the attacker must resort to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">return-oriented
programming</a> instead â€” not a huge obstacle for many attackers.)
<p>
The solution, as described in the paper and implemented in the <a
href="/Articles/700606/">exclusive page frame ownership (XPFO) patch
set</a> posted by Juerg Haefliger, is to take away the back-door access to
user-space pages via the direct mapping.  The mechanism is fairly simple in
concept.  Whenever a page is allocated for user-space use (something the
kernel already indicates with the GFP flags in the allocation request), the
direct mapping for that page is removed.  Thus, even if an attacker can
generate the directly mapped address for the page and get the kernel to
jump there, the kernel will fault due to lack of access permissions to that
page.  When user space frees a page, it will be zeroed (to prevent attacks
via hostile code left in the page) and returned to the direct map.
<p>
There are times when the kernel must access user-space memory, of course;
the <tt>copy_to_user()</tt> and <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> functions are
obvious examples.  In such cases, the direct mapping is restored for the
duration of the operation.
<p>
Naturally, there is a performance cost to this.  The mapping and unmapping
of pages in the kernel's address space will slow things down somewhat, as
will the zeroing of returned user-space pages.
Perhaps more significant, though, is a change in how the direct mapping is
implemented.  Normally, the kernel creates this mapping with huge pages;
that, among other things, greatly reduces the pressure on the processor's
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) when the direct mapping is accessed.
But use of huge pages is incompatible with adding and removing mappings for
individual (small) pages in that range, so, with XPFO, the huge-page mappings have
to go.  There is also some increased memory overhead resulting from the need
to store more per-page information.  All told, enabling XPFO has a
performance cost up to about 3% in the worst case, though most of the
benchmarks reported in the paper suffered much less than that.
<p>
The patch set needs some completion work before it can be seriously
considered for merging into the mainline.  Once that point comes, one can
assume that the conversation will hinge on how effective it is at
preventing exploits and whether it is worth the performance cost.  The fact
that the slowdown for kernel builds is 2.5% could prove to be a bit of an
obstacle in this discussion.  A performance hit on that scale is a hard
thing to swallow, but so are successful exploits.  Which pill will prove to
be the bitterest will have to be seen as the patch set progresses.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This patch is bogus -- it's a good example of a poor mitigation.  If the root problem is W, and there are methods X, Y, and Z to exploit that problem, all equally feasible for an attacker, it's silly to promote patches like this as a solution to the problem when they can only deal with method X.  It's faith-based security, but surely would be considered a KSPP success story if merged.<br>
<p>
I should also mention that there are numerous glaring factual errors in the article (unsurprisingly due to repeating the same mistakes of the paper author and not adjusting some of the claims to kernels within the past 2 years or so) but I'm curious to see if anyone else can spot them without my help, or if everyone will just take the article at face value.<br>

While solution A to problem W that only solves X, not Y or Z is obviously less than ideal, it always trumps solution B which hasn't been submitted upstream (and thus, in practice, doesn't exist), no matter how superior it is.<br>

That's exactly what you've been doing for years. You go a bit beyond lashing out at merely the upstream kernel hand that feeds you though; you also spew venom at reporters, developers and end users who don't shower you in praise and roses while also telling them you know what's best for them.<br>

What does my comment have anything to do with the tired ad hominem you've regurgitated here?  We already reviewed this mitigation back when the paper was initially released, and there are good reasons why it's not present in grsecurity.  I guess I'll avoid offering any free review or hints here in the future and leave it up to the upstream "experts".<br>

<p>
Perhaps, but I'm not claiming that my comments here are of any inherent value, nor am I threatening to deprive LWN readers the awesomeness of my "free review or hints".<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Have you ever contributed anything of technical value?</font><br>
<p>
Why yes, I have:<br>
<p>
Two chunks of Linux kernel code bear my name -- One wifi driver that I heavily cleaned up [ie rewrote large chunks of], mainlined and still maintain, and another that I originally wrote but someone else mainlined (after some rewriting).  <br>
<p>
(So yes, I have first-hand knowledge of just how much work mainlining something can be.  Incidentally, the latter bears quite a few similarities to this situation -- Only I had the maturity to not complain about how those folks doing the work I was unwilling to do were somehow doing it all wrong.  I even tossed some patches their way to help out)<br>
<p>
I'm also a major contributor to Gutenprint, having written drivers for several dozen photo printers.<br>
<p>
Beyond that, there's a long tail of mostly-minor contributions to various F/OSS projects.  I try to give back whenever possible, and my track record shows that I play well with others.<br>
<p>
Any more questions?<br>

KERNEXEC in PaX does a whole lot more than just prevent direct userspace code execution in kernel mode, it also prevents code execution anywhere in kernel memory that wasn't meant to hold code, all the way back since 2003 (incidentally the same year when ROP, albeit not yet named as such, also died).<br>

Yes, that's what the article says at the end. But you can still place the stack pointer in the direct map in order to bypass SMAP, and then do ROP.<br>

There's been a lot of confusion around the kernel/user memory segregation features, so a while back I attempted to clarify the CPU vs upstream kernel features needed for PXN/SMEP (block execution of user-space memory from kernel-space) and PAN/SMAP (block read/write of user-space memory from kernel-space), either in hardware or emulated, with some tables here:<br>
<p>
PXN/SMEP: <a href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Exploit_Methods/Userspace_execution#Mitigations">http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Exploit_Methods/Userspa...</a><br>

1. i think referring to SMEP/PXN as 'segmentation' is somewhat confusing as that word has a specific meaning on x86 chips (and yet another on ppc) and no meaning on arm AFAIK.<br>
<p>
2. the UDEREF style page table entry shadowing and switching on user/kernel transitions would work on any arch that can otherwise support kernel mode execution control (so UDEREF works on pre-IVB, let alone pre-BDW). if the arch has some form of address space/context ID mechanism then this can be further optimized though in my experience the end result still sucks for performance unfortunately.<br>
<p>
3. i wouldn't call data access control/prevention a superset of execution prevention as i think most processors clearly distinguish between insn fetches and data accesses (different caches, TLBs, access control, etc) and thus you can control them indepedently.<br>

1. Yes, quite right. I've changed those to "segregation". I'm open to a better term for this, though.<br>
<p>
2. I think I covered that already in the text above the tables ("via separate page tables" and "page table swapping"). Is it the table's "could use PCID?" note that feels inaccurate?<br>
<p>
3. Yup, fair point. I've clarified it to mention the emulation case (e.g. CONFIG_SW_DOMAIN_PAN provides PXN emulation as well as PAN emulation) and distinguish the instruction fetch from data access.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Importantly, it's a kernel-space address and, on some systems (x86 before 3.9 and all ARM), this memory range is executable by the kernel.</font><br>
<p>
I think that the paper is somewhat outdated w.r.t. its comments regarding ARM.<br>
<p>
For arm, since v3.18, as of commit 1e6b48116a95046e ("ARM: mm: allow non-text sections to be non-executable"), the linear map is not executable, modulo a small overlap with the kernel text mapping.<br>
<p>
For arm64, since v3.19, commit da141706aea52c1a ("arm64: add better page protections to arm64"), the linear map is not executable, modulo a small overlap with the kernel text mapping. v4.5 commit 068a17a5805dfbca ("arm64: mm: create new fine-grained mappings at boot") gets rid of that overlap.<br>

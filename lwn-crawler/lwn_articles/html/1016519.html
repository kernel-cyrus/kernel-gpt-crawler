Tiered-memory systems feature multiple types of memory with varying
performance characteristics; on such systems, good performance depends on
keeping the most frequently used data in the fastest memory.  Identifying
that data and placing it properly is a challenge that has kept developers
busy for years.  Bharata Rao, presenting remotely during a
memory-management-track session at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, led a discussion on <a
href="/Articles/1014220/#hotpage">a potential solution</a> he has recently
posted; Raghavendra K&nbsp;T was also named on <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20250123105721.424117-1-raghavendra.kt@amd.com/">the
session proposal</a>.  It seems likely, based on the discussion, that
developers working in this area will not run out of problems anytime soon.
<p>
There are two aspects to the memory-promotion problem: detecting which
pages should be moved, and actually migrating them.  On the detection side,
there are a number of sources for data that can be used to detect hot
(frequently accessed) pages; Rao is mostly focused on approaches that
involve scanning page tables to see which pages have been accessed
recently.  He thinks that the current scanning implementation needs an
overhaul; it is tied to the NUMA-balancing code, and its operation tends to
create latency spikes for applications.  Since both the page-table-entry
(PTE) scanning and page migration are done in process context, they
interrupt user-space execution in potentially disruptive ways.
<p>
Additionally, he said, there is an increasing number of ways to detect
memory access â€” new data-temperature sources are becoming available.  That
suggests a need for a way to gather this data together and act on it in one
place.  His proposal is a new kernel thread, <tt>kmmscand</tt>, that would
take over this task.  It would maintain a list of process address spaces,
then perform "A-bit" scanning (clearing the "accessed" bit in the PTEs,
then scanning later to see which PTEs have had the bit set, indicating an
access in the meantime) on each.  The results of the scan are then used to
create a list of pages to promote to faster memory.
<p>
In Rao's implementation, the migration task is separated into its own
thread that runs independently of the scanning thread.  The performance
impact of the scanning can be regulated by adjusting the rate at which PTEs
are scanned or by exempting some processes from scanning altogether.  There
is still room for improvement, though, he said.  In particular, there is
always a need for better hot-page detection, and there is a need for
throttling and batching of the migration work as well.
<p>
A participant asked how often address spaces are scanned; Rao answered
that, initially, a scan is performed every two seconds.  Over time, the
rate is adjusted according to conditions; it can end up anywhere between
0.5 and five seconds.
<p>
Another participant said that effective scanning requires flushing the
translation lookaside buffer (TLB); otherwise, it will short out the
address-translation process that sets the A&nbsp;bit in the first place.
TLB flushes, of course, can hurt performance.  Rao answered that the
current implementation promotes pages the first time an access is observed,
so missing data on subsequent accesses is not a problem.  SeongJae Park
said that <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/damon/">DAMON</a>, which also
performs this sort of scanning, is not currently doing TLB flushes.  That
drew another question about whether this scanning should just be integrated
into DAMON rather than being implemented as a separate thread; Rao answered
that integrating the systems is something he will be looking into.
Davidlohr Bueso pointed out that enterprise distributions do not normally
enable DAMON, but Park answered that Red Hat and Debian are indeed enabling
it.
<p>
Gregory Price said that the scanning thread will have to hold locks while
passing over the page tables, and asked whether that has been observed to
cause latencies for the processes being scanned.  Rao said that the overall
result of his implementation is a significant reduction in latencies
experienced by applications, but did not address the locking issue
specifically.  Jonathan Cameron asked how the scanning of huge pages was
handled; Rao said that the thread is just scanning PTEs and not doing
anything special for huge pages.
<p>
Another participant worried about the cost of scanning especially large
address spaces and asked if the overhead had been measured.  Rao answered
that there is still a need to understand the full cost of A-bit scanning.
If it turns out to be a problem, there are optimizations, such as scanning
at the PMD level first before dropping down to the PTE level in hot areas,
that can be considered.  There have been some experiments done with 64GB
address spaces, he said, that have shown an improvement over current
kernels.
<p>
A remote participant pointed out that the <a
href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational LRU</a> also optimizes its
scanning by looking at higher-level page tables first; among other things,
that helps it to avoid scanning unmapped memory.  Cameron pointed out that
scanning the higher-level tables will only be useful if the TLB is
regularly flushed.  But Yuanchu Xie said that the multi-generational LRU
scanning seems to be optimized well, and is integrated with the reclaim
system as well.  Rao agreed that this avenue needs more exploration.
<p>
At the end of the session, Rao raised one last problem: while A-bit
scanning can identify hot pages, it provides no information about which
NUMA nodes have accessed any given page.  As a result, there is no way to
know which node a hot page should be promoted to.  There needs to be a way
to maintain home-node information for pages he said.  Alternatively, the
system could also scan pages in the fastest tiers to see where the pages in
a given address space are clustered now, then promote other pages to the
same nodes.  The group seemed to think that this could be an interesting
heuristic to explore.

The TLB flush problem does not seem critical in hot page detection, because the systems and jobs that take advantage of a lower tier of memory most likely exceed TLB coverage. MGLRU page table scanning has optimizations beyond the pmd young check, so if it does turn out to be a problem, the check can always be disabled.<br>

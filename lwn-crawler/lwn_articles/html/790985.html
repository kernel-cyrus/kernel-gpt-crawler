           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 14, 2019</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit</a> included <a href="/Articles/787434/">a
detailed discussion</a> about a  memory-management fix that
addressed one performance regression while causing another.  That fix,
which was promptly reverted, is still believed by most memory-management
developers to implement the correct behavior, so <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190503223146.2312-3-aarcange@redhat.com/">a
patch</a> posted by Andrea Arcangeli in early May has relatively broad
support.  That patch remains unapplied as of this writing, but the
discussion surrounding it has continued at a slow pace over the last
month.  Memory-management subsystem maintainer Andrew Morton is faced with
a choice: which performance regression is more important?
<p>
The behavior in question relates to the intersection of transparent huge
pages and NUMA policy.  Ever since <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/077fcf116c8c">this commit from Aneesh
Kumar</a> in 2015, the kernel will, for memory areas where
<tt>madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)</tt> has been called, attempt to
allocate huge pages exclusively on the current NUMA node.  It turns out
that the kernel 
will try so hard that it will go into aggressive reclaim and compaction on
that node,
forcing out other pages, even if free memory exists on other nodes in the
system.  In essence, enabling transparent huge pages for a range of memory
has become an equivalent to binding that memory to a single NUMA node.  The
result, as observed by many, can be severe swap storms and a dramatic loss
of performance.
<p>
In an attempt to fix this problem, Arcangeli applied <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/ac5b2c18911ffe95">a patch</a> in November
2018 
that loosened the tight binding to the current node.  But, it turned out,
some workloads want that binding behavior.  Local huge pages will
perform better than huge pages on a remote node; even local small pages
tend to be better than remote huge pages.  For some tasks, the performance
penalty for using 
remote pages is high enough that it is worth going to great lengths — even
enduring a swap storm at application startup — to avoid it.  No such
workload has been publicly posted, but the patch <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2f0799a0ffc0">was reverted</a> by David
Rientjes in December after <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181127062503.GH6163@shao2-debian/">a huge
discussion</a>. 
<p>
The problem is that far more users appear to be affected by the swap storms
than by non-local huge pages; if nothing else, the former problem is far
easier to notice than the latter.  So a number of distributions have
reverted the revert, causing their kernels to have significantly different
behavior than mainline kernels.  The feeling that
the reverting of Arcangeli's patch was a mistake appears to have grown over
time,
leading to the current attempt to reapply the patch and prioritize
swap-storm avoidance over huge-page locality.
<p>
While most developers appear to support this change, not all do.  In
particular, Rientjes is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1905201018480.96074@chino.kir.corp.google.com/">strongly
in favor</a> of retaining the current behavior:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We are going in circles, *yes* there is a problem for potential
	swap storms today because of the poor interaction between memory
	compaction and directed reclaim but this is a result of a poor API
	that does not allow userspace to specify that its workload really
	will span multiple sockets so faulting remotely is the best course
	of action.  The fix is not to cause regressions for others who have
	implemented a userspace stack that is based on the past 3+ years of
	long standing behavior or for specialized workloads where it is
	known that it spans multiple sockets so we want some kind of
	different behavior.
</div>
<p>
Rientjes argued that the kernel does not currently provide an API that is
adequate for all workloads to specify the behavior they need.  He would
rather see the addition of a <tt>prctl()</tt> call that would let an
application say explicitly that its working set will not fit into a
single node; after this call has been made, the kernel would allocate huge
pages from remote nodes if need be.  Various other calls could also be
added to give applications (and administrators) more control over NUMA
allocation policy for huge pages in particular.
<p>
There is little disagreement over whether the API should be improved, at
least in principle.  But, as Morton <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190523175737.2fb5b997df85b5d117092b5b@linux-foundation.org/">pointed
out</a>: "<q>Implementing a new API doesn't help existing userspace
which is hurting from the problem which this patch addresses</q>".  He,
too, seems to believe that it would be better to address the swap-storm
issue now, then work later to address the needs of applications that
absolutely cannot live with remote huge-page allocations.
<p>
Rientjes <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1906061451001.121338@chino.kir.corp.google.com/">is
adamant</a> that the current semantics should be preserved, though.  He has
some thoughts on how the allocator could be changed to improve its
behavior, mostly focused on avoiding aggressive reclaim in situations where
it is unlikely to help.  Michal Hocko <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190607083255.GA18435@dhcp22.suse.cz/">worried</a>
that the proposed changes would make transparent huge-page allocation less
effective in general, and pointed out that tweaking the allocator leaves
the core problem unaddressed:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And really, fundamental problem here is that MADV_HUGEPAGE has
	gained a NUMA semantic without a due scrutiny leading to a broken
	interface with side effects that are simply making the interface
	unusable for a large part of usecases that the madvise was
	originally designed for.  Until we find an agreement on this point
	we will be looping in a dead end discussion, I am afraid.
</div>
<p>
The discussion has also not been helped by the fact that Rientjes has not
posted an example of a workload that suffers with Arcangeli's patch
applied.  The closest
he came ("<q>induce node local fragmentation (easiest to do by
injecting a kernel module), do MADV_HUGEPAGE over a large range, fault, and
measure random access latency</q>") proved to be somewhat unsatisfying.
Without a workload to test against, other developers cannot know whether
their changes make things better or worse, or even how severe the problem
actually is.  Hocko, for example, believes that the NUMA balancing built
into the kernel now should straighten out workloads that may have initially
had huge pages allocated on remote nodes, but nobody can demonstrate
whether that is true or not.  This has led Mel Gorman to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190524100702.GD23719@suse.de/">complain</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I find it amazing that you think leaving users with trivial to
	reproduce swap storms is acceptable until some unreproducible
	workload can be fixed with some undefined set of unimplemented
	memory policies.
</div>
<p>
Gorman proposed an additional bit for the <tt>zone_reclaim_mode</tt> sysctl
knob that might provide behavior closer to what Rientjes appears to need;
that mode would be off by default but could be enabled for specific
workloads.  Rientjes has not responded to this proposal.
<p>
This discussion has, as numerous participants pointed out, gone around in
circles for a while now.  Other than Rientjes, no memory-management
developers stepped up to defend the status quo; the consensus for applying
Arcangeli's patch seems nearly complete.  But there remains a real
possibility that, should this patch make it to the mainline, complaints
about performance regressions will cause it to be reverted — again — as a
strict reading of the kernel's no-regressions policy would seem to require.
<p>
Everybody involved would prefer to avoid that course of events, thus the
attempts to understand the problem and find a solution that works for
everybody involved.  But memory management is always a balancing act, even
when full information about the workloads involved is available.  In the
absence of that information, developers are left groping for solutions in
the dark, and achieving that balance becomes that much harder.  In such
situations, it may indeed make sense to apply a patch that fixes a known
problem and which is already carried by multiple distributions.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This situation does seem a bit remarkable reading the threads. It’s been over half a year now with David refusing (I don’t think that’s an uncharitable summary) to provide a reproducer while insisting that it’s trivial to create one.<br>
<p>
This also shows the limitations of a strict no-regression policy: the original change obviously caused severe regressions, but because it sneaked into the kernel without anyone noticing at the time, Linus now thinks we should just be stuck with it unless we can fix David’s non-public use case.<br>

This kind of double standard is pretty common.  You may file a bug report, with patch, fixing a recently introduced bug.  Then you have to fight through a thicket of queries and objections -- scripts might be relying on the existing behaviour, it might be a bug fix but I think we should redesign this whole module from scratch before changing anything, we can't change anything until the 3.0 release.  When quite obviously none of these tests applied at the point the bug was introduced.<br>

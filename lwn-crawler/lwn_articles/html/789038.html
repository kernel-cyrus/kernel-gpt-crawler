           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 22, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
Amir Goldstein has a use case for a feature that could be called a "lazy
file reflink", he said, though it might also be described as "VFS-level
snapshots".  He went through the use case, looking for suggestions, in a
session at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit
(LSFMM).  He has already implemented parts of the solution, but would like
to get something upstream, which would mean shifting from the
stacked-filesystem approach he has taken so far.
</p>

<p>
He has a working prototype of some of what he wants, which he presented two
years ago as <a href="/Articles/719772/">overlayfs snapshots</a>.  It has
improved since then.  The idea was to identify a subdirectory and snapshot
it, so that any changes to the files in that hierarchy would be
handled in a copy-on-write (CoW) fashion.  It was done at the VFS layer, so
it did not matter what actual filesystem type was being used. 
It worked using <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ficlonerange.2.html"><tt>FICLONE</tt></a>
operations or by making file copies for file changes.  That means you would
want to use it on filesystems that support clone/reflink operations, though
filesystems that support their own snapshots, such as Btrfs, probably are
not good candidates.
</p>

<p>
His company is using the VFS snapshot mechanism, but only to track
namespace changes: file renames, new files, and deleted files.  It is not
using the mechanism for
tracking changes to the file data, which is convenient because that means
it does not need the underlying filesystem to support clone operations.
</p>

<p>
Instead, for changes to the file data, he is using the <a
href="/Articles/755277/">filesystem change journal</a> that he talked about
at last year's LSFMM.  This is similar to the <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/change-journals">change
journal</a> available with NTFS; it does persistent change tracking in a
way that is reliable, unlike solutions based on fsnotify, which underlies
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a> and <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html">fanotify</a>.
Fsnotify can lose events if there is an 
overflow or crash.  The change journal guarantees that changes in a
particular directory will be seen.
</p>

<p>
He has this code running in production and the <a
href="https://github.com/amir73il/overlayfs/wiki/Overlayfs-snapshots">code
is public</a>, but he would like to make it more widely usable.  There are
some limitations since it is implemented as a stacked filesystem.  There
are other use cases, such as <a
href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/">Watchman</a> from Facebook and
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit">VFS for Git</a> from
Microsoft; both are trying to solve similar problems.  Watchman is using
inotify
recursively with all of the disadvantages that come with that.
</p>

<p>
So he would like to provide a way for applications to watch changes on,
say, a Git project, and to do it consistently and reliably without using a
stacked filesystem.  There are two gaps that he has identified; he is
looking for ideas on how to fill them.
The first is that the hooks he has available only allow getting events when
a file is opened for write.  If it is already open, there is no facility to
get a notification on the first time it is modified via a <tt>write()</tt>
or a change to a region mapped with <tt>mmap()</tt>.  He would like to be
able to freeze the file, flush its pages to persistent storage, then get an
event when the first write happens after that.  He would like to implement
that in a non-intrusive way.
</p>

<p>
The second gap is the lack of a way to do subtree filtering at the kernel
level. That way, a watch could be established on a subtree and only events
from that subtree would be reported; macOS has this facility.  His thinking
is to have an
API to mark a directory as a subtree root, then perhaps something could be
added to the VFS to directly handle subtrees.  There may be some
commonality with some gaps that Btrfs has for subvolume handling, he said.
It would provide the ability to create fixed subtrees that users cannot
change. 
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara said that for fanotify and things like it, he does not think
isolating a subtree so that users cannot, for example, hard link into or
out of them is what is needed.  Goldstein said that one of his ideas was that
you could not rename files into or out of the subtree, but Kara said that
would have strange semantics that would not be understandable for
user-space programs. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion on how the subtree support could be implemented,
but the assembled developers did not seem to entirely grasp what Goldstein
was envisioningâ€”or perhaps it was only me who did not follow what he was
after.  In any case, Goldstein said that he would be trying to implement
something that he could post for comment.  He asked if attendees had
thoughts on the first problem he posed: getting a pre-write notification on
an open file.  Prior to LSFMM, he had <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAOQ4uxgq3iR%2Bw%3DqTrbA6Pqney4NjJP7fAQpWVBSbrZYS%2BiC4cg%40mail.gmail.com/">summarized</a>
his ideas in a post to the linux-fsdevel mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein noted that when he posted his <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAOQ4uxgqm-m1Zj073o_vSnwkTbGObJiQ-CdWV2ESd_P-29=jZw@mail.gmail.com/">initial
request</a> for an LSFMM slot on the topic, Dave Chinner had <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20190128212642.GQ4205@dastard/">replied</a> with
some thoughts on a per-file freeze API, so he may have another use case.
What Goldstein is looking for is different than a mandatory lock on a file
because 
others processes could still have the file open for write.  Like a
filesystem freeze, though, write operations would not complete until the
unfreeze (or, in his case, the notification is acknowledged).  Ted Ts'o
asked if what he wanted was a way to make any attempts 
to modify the file block, while reads could still complete.  Goldstein said
that what he needs is a notification on the first change to a file after a given
point in time. 
</p>

<p>
That notification needs to be given before the file changes so that the
change journal can record it persistently.  In fsnotify terms, what he
wants would be a write pre-modification one-shot mark, Kara said.  Ts'o
asked if he was asking for user space to be able to get the notification
and acknowledge it before the write could proceed.  Goldstein said that he
did not need the user-space side of that, since his use case is inside the
kernel, but other use cases might want that capability.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o asked if any modification to the page cache for the file might
need to send this 
notification, which could actually stop the change from happening.  It
could be done with a new security hook, Goldstein said; there is currently
no security hook for writes to <tt>mmap()</tt> regions.  He is not
suggesting a security hook for every page fault, but does want to block the
first modification until it gets recorded; if the notification does not get
acknowledged, then the application would get a segmentation fault.
</p>

<p>
There are concerns about doing this kind of thing from the
page-fault-handling code.  Goldstein only wants the first write to any page
for a 
given inode to trigger his notification, but if it were a security hook,
others could use it 
differently, which might result in page faults being arbitrarily delayed.
Kara noted that currently the security hooks are always called from a
system-call context, while this would be called from the page-fault
context, which is significantly different, especially with regard to locking.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the consensus seemed to be that this would be complex and
difficult to implement correctly.  There were problems implementing the
security hook for <tt>open()</tt>, Ts'o said, and this will "be ten times
worse".

Thanks for the article, and the link to the GitHub repo.<br>
<p>
Can someone point me to the code location for the "filesystem change journal" portion? It's what's most interesting to me. I would like to see if GNOME Tracker can be finally be made to behave at a reasonable speed on rotational drives :-p.<br>

All the pieces needed for "filesystem change journal" are available in my GitHub repo.<br>
Unfortunately, the "filesystem change journal" is not available as a packaged software nor is there proper documentation how to set it up.<br>
I would like to make the technology available to users and GNOME Tracker is a classic use case, but haven't had the time to do that.<br>
<p>
The change tracking is done by a stacked filesystem called "snapshot".<br>
This means that if Tracker is indexing /home, then /home should be a "snapshot" mount of (e.g.) /.home<br>
and no users should modify /.home directly or changes will be lost.<br>
So you see, setting up a "filesystem change journal" is not a programmatic thing, it is an administrative thing, involving boot/login scripts.<br>
There is a programmatic interface for GNOME Tracker to actually make use of the change information, but that's the trivial part.<br>
<p>
If you are a GNOME Tracker developer interested in integrating the technology, I invite you to contact me on linux-fsdevel and I will guide you through the process.<br>
 <br>
The article says "There are some limitations since it is implemented as a stacked filesystem", so let me elaborate on that.<br>
When users/applications access /home they now access through a filesystem called "snapshot" and not the original ext4/xfs/btrfs they are used to.<br>
This can have many subtle implications, for example, custom ioctls will not work and applications that try to figure out which filesystem<br>
they are running on will get confused. This is why I am considering the change to fsnotify model instead of stacked filesystem.<br>

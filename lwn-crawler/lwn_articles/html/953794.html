<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 7, 2023</br>
           </div>
User-space shadow stacks are a relatively new feature in Linux; support was
only added for 6.6, and <a href="/Articles/926649/">is limited to the x86
architecture</a>.  As support for other architectures (including <a
href="/Articles/940403/">arm64</a> and RISC-V) approaches readiness,
though, more thought is going into the API for this feature.  As a recent
discussion on the integration of shadow stacks with the <a
href="/Articles/792628/"><tt>clone3()</tt> system call</a> shows, there are
still some details to be worked out.
<p>
A shadow stack is a copy of the current call stack that contains only
return addresses; it is maintained by the CPU.  While user-space code can
access (and even modify) the shadow stack, that access is limited in a
number of ways by the hardware.  When a shadow stack is enabled, every
function call results in the return address being pushed onto both the
regular and the shadow stacks.  Whenever a function returns, the return
address on the regular stack is compared to the copy on the shadow stack;
if the two don't match, the processor will trap and (normally) the affected
process will be killed.  This feature is meant to provide a defense against
attacks based on overrunning stack-based variables, including <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">return-oriented
programming (ROP)</a> attacks.
<p>
There is code that will not work with a shadow stack, so the feature cannot
be enabled by default.  Thus, when a process is created, it does not have a
shadow stack, even on an architecture that supports the feature; a shadow
stack can be created and enabled with a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
call.  If, however, a thread with a shadow stack already set up creates a
new thread, the kernel will create and install a shadow stack for that
thread before it begins execution; that ensures that the thread will never
run without protection.  As will be seen, though, there are reasons why a
process may want a higher level of control over how that shadow stack is
created.
<p>
In October, Mark Brown (who is working on the arm64 shadow-stack
implementation) posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231023-clone3-shadow-stack-v1-0-d867d0b5d4d0@kernel.org/">a
patch series</a> adding that control to <tt>clone3()</tt>, a relatively new
system call that was designed to allow the addition of new features in this
way.  The initial version of the series added two fields to the
<tt>clone_args</tt> structure used to pass parameters to <tt>clone3()</tt>:
the address and size of the shadow stack to be provided to the new thread.
Rick Edgecombe (who carried the x86 implementation over the finish line)
quickly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/dc9a3dd544bbf859142c5582011a924b1c1bf6ed.camel@intel.com/">pointed
out a problem</a> with that API, though: the ability to place the shadow
stack in memory could be used to put it in an inconvenient location â€” on
top of another shadow stack, for example.  Nothing good would come from
such an action, and it could be used as an attack vector.
<p>
After some discussion, it was concluded that, while it might be useful to
allow user space to be able to position the shadow stack exactly, there was no
overwhelming need for that capability.  So, in subsequent versions of the
series (including the current <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231128-clone3-shadow-stack-v4-0-8b28ffe4f676@kernel.org/">fourth
revision</a>), only the size of the desired shadow stack can be provided to
<tt>clone3()</tt>, in a <tt>clone_args</tt> field called, unsurprisingly,
<tt>shadow_stack_size</tt>.  If that size is provided, it will be used by
the kernel to create the new thread's shadow stack; otherwise the default
size (which is equal to the size of the regular stack) will be used
instead.
<p>
By <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231120-clone3-shadow-stack-v3-0-a7b8ed3e2acc@kernel.org/">version
3</a>, posted in in late November, the patch set appeared to be settling
down.  Christian Brauner, though, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231121-urlaub-motivieren-c9d7ee1a6058@brauner/">questioned
whether this API was worth adding</a>, worrying that it was a step toward
turning <tt>clone3()</tt> (which he created) into "<q>a fancier version of
prctl()</q>". He wondered why it was necessary to allow user space to
affect the size of the shadow stack at thread-creation time.  Recognizing
that he perhaps did not fully understand the problem, he asked a few
questions about the motivations for this change.
<p>
One of those motivations is to prevent over-allocation of the shadow stack,
which can result from the current policy of allocating the shadow stack
with a size equal to that of the regular stack.  Szabolcs Nagy <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZVyg0WgILK35xjBn@arm.com/">explained the problem</a>
in this case: if a thread is created with a large (regular) stack, perhaps
so that it can store a large array of data there, the shadow stack will be
just as large, and almost all of that space will be wasted.  For a single
thread, perhaps that waste could be tolerated, but in an application with a
large number of threads, it could add up to a lot of lost memory.
<p>
There is also a case where an equally sized shadow stack could be too
small.  The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaltstack.2.html"><tt>sigaltstack()</tt></a>
system call allows a thread to set up an alternative stack to be used for
signal delivery.  Even when a thread is switched to its alternative stack,
though, it continues to use the same shadow stack.  If the thread exhausts
the regular stack, then handles a signal (perhaps even caused by running
out of stack space) with a deep call chain on an alternative stack, the
shadow stack could overflow.
<p>
The kernel can try to make an educated guess as to what the optimal
shadow-stack size might be, but it will remain a guess.  As Brown <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZVzWRIA9AfXHeWMW@finisterre.sirena.org.uk/">pointed
out</a>, the only way to improve on that guess is to accept information
from user space, which (presumably) has a better idea of what its needs
are.  Creating a new thread without a shadow stack and letting that thread
map one explicitly would be one way to solve the problem; creating a
suitably sized shadow stack in <tt>clone3()</tt>, though, ensures that the
new thread will never run without shadow-stack coverage.
<p>
Brauner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231123-geflattert-mausklick-63d8ebcacffb@brauner/">seemed
to accept</a> the reasoning behind the addition of this feature to
<tt>clone3()</tt>, but he worried that there is currently only one
architecture with shadow-stack support in the mainline currently.  The
addition of others, he hinted, could drive changes in the proposed API; he
suggested keeping the <tt>clone3()</tt> changes out of the mainline until
arm64 support has been merged.  Brown <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZV85khoUcFyKhQ+w@finisterre.sirena.org.uk/">was
amenable</a> to that plan for now, as long as the arm64 and
<tt>clone3()</tt> changes could be merged together.
<p>
That seems likely to be how things will go from here.  The merging of arm64
shadow-stack support appears to be on a slow path while the user-space side
is being finalized, so it may be a while before all this work lands in a
mainline kernel.  If all goes well, though, it will eventually be possible
to control the size of the shadow stack given to new threads on all
architectures that implement shadow stacks.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

My understanding is that userspace can access shadow stack memory, at least under some conditions, so as an rr maintainer I suspect we are going to need the ability to control where shadow stacks are allocated, so we can ensure during replay the shadow stacks are allocated at the same address as during recording.<br>
<p>
But I would have thought CRIU has the same issues, and yet I know CRIU maintainers have been talking to the CET people and this hasn't come up?<br>

Yep, map_shadow_stack syscall takes an optional address (like mmap), and the CRIU patches used it.<br>
<p>
The earlier proposed clone3 design involved userspace allocating the shadow stack and then passing the address into clone3. So it was setting the shadow stack pointer register (SSP) to an arbitrary point, not telling the kernel to allocate the shadow stack at a specific point.<br>
<p>
Do you mean rr needs to control where a newly created thread allocates a shadow stack? If so could you comment the details on the mailing list to that series? Keep in mind the SSP is controllable via ptrace, so a tracer should be able to write to shadow stacks, set the SSP wherever it wants, and map shadow stacks at specific locations (via map_shadow_stack injection). So it seems like something could me made to work, but it would be good to know if there are any hard requirements.<br>

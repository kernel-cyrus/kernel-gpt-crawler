           </div>
Free-software development is meant to be fun, at least some of the time.
Even developers of database-management systems seem to think that it is
fun; there is no accounting for taste, it seems.  Part of having fun is
certainly allowing the occasional exercise of one's sense of humor while
working on the code.  But, as some recent "fix" attempts show, humor does
not always carry through to developers all over the planet.  Balancing
humor and inclusiveness is always going to be a challenge for our community.
<p>
There is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.8/source/kernel/sched/topology.c#L1927">a
function in the kernel scheduler</a> that will, if things go badly wrong,
inform users that a bug is present, describing it as "<q>arch topology
borken</q>".  The message is, of course, breathtaking in its clarity;
users will immediately know what to do when they see it.  Recently, though,
a well-intentioned developer <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210526021856.9060-1-thunder.leizhen@huawei.com/">sent
a patch</a> changing the message to read "broken" instead.  This patch was not
accepted, but it did result in a brief discussion explaining the nature of
the intended joke to the submitter.
<p>

The following day, somebody else attempted to fix <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.8/source/kernel/sched/core.c#L7636">another
scheduler function</a> containing a comment that cites "<q>histerical
raisins</q>".  This time, the poster was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YK+5eKc4kx4+ALD1@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">instructed</a>
to search for "humour", which is rather less illuminating.  Other examples
abound; one of the more amusing such attempts came last 
year, when a developer <a
href="/ml/linux-doc/20200409132437.11531-1-richard.weiyang@gmail.com/">concluded</a>
that the title of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.8/source/Documentation/RCU/RTFP.txt">this
document</a> required a spelling correction; the <a
href="/ml/linux-doc/20200409134634.GL17661@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72/">response</a>
this time politely declined the patch, but encouraged the poster by saying
"<q>rest assured that you did get [the] point!</q>".
<p>
Anybody who has spent any amount of time trying to function in a non-native
language understands that humor can be difficult.  It is deeply tied to
both the language it is expressed in and the specific context where it is
found.  Words that fluent speakers find funny can simply fly over the
head of those who are less proficient, and attempts to be funny in a
non-native language do not always go well.  Your editor has a hard time
getting a laugh from native English speakers; he has learned that it's better not
to even try in other settings.

<p>
Source code is meant to be precise and understandable.  Comments are there
to help when the code itself is not enough to explain why a particular
action is taken.  When those comments contain plays on words, creative
misspellings, or jargon-laden inside jokes, they will become less clear to
people who may be struggling to understand even plainly written English.
Such readers will trip over the language in question, and some of them
may then be moved to try to "fix" it.  The result is a certain amount of
confusion and lost time.
<p>
One possible solution could be to eliminate this kind of play on words as
an impediment to global free-software development.  As Zhen Lei <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5571d34f-1965-8d8e-3033-6352dd0dcaee@huawei.com/">said</a>
in the first discussion linked above: "<q>Linux is an open-source
code for the world, so it's better to use a more common word.</q>"  If
we stuck with common words, we would see less confusion, fewer "fixes" for
intentional humor, and possibly better participation overall.
<p>
But, remember, free-software development is supposed to be fun as well as
useful; that is part of why many of us got into it in the first place.
Turning a free-software project into a humor-free zone would make it
distinctly less fun, which could be seen as an inclusiveness problem in its
own right.  The cure could be far worse than the disease.
<p>
Fortunately, nobody is proposing any such thing.  Most of us are agreed
that life can only be improved by something that brings a little smile in
the middle of an extensive code-reading session.  With any luck at all, our
code will continue to acquire the occasional comment that makes it clear
that we do not take ourselves too seriously.
<p>
But that means we will also continue to receive the occasional "fix" from
readers who were unable to appreciate a humorous turn of phrase and wish to
straighten it out in some way.  Those will be the best occasions of all to
demonstrate that, indeed, we do not take ourselves too seriously.  A curt
response from a developer who clearly feels that their time is being wasted
may turn away an aspiring contributor who we would much rather keep.  A
kind response, explaining the phrasing in question, will help that
contributor appreciate the humor, improve their language skills, and get
them to the point where, someday, they will embed some humor in useful code
of their own.  Others, silently watching the conversation, may also
benefit. 
<p>
For better or worse, English is the language of the free-software
development community.  English is not the native language of a
majority of our contributors, though, and some of those contributors will
struggle with it
at times.  But, with some patience, we can have our code and laugh at it
too.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The offensiveness of my comments depends entirely on what kind of project it is. If it&#x27;s professional, you can expect to see a little cursing and my usual cynicism, but nothing too edgy. If it&#x27;s open source, I have code that instructs readers to perform analingus on me and/or their grandmother if, per chance, they dislike and/or wish to change a particular section of code.<br>
<p>
Does it disturb people? Sure. But, abhorrent humor is an integral part of who I am, and I am a true believer in The Satanic Temple&#x27;s 4th tenet: &quot;The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one&#x27;s own.&quot;<br>
<p>
Similar reasons are why I refuse to follow language-specific style guides much of the time, particularly Rust&#x27;s, because the compiler attempts to enforce it with a warning, which I find, ironically, very offensive.<br>

It&#x27;s not presented in a particularly clear way: I was still waiting for the proverb to begin by the time I was half-way through reading it. That&#x27;s even before you consider the double negative (which I&#x27;d assume is half the joke). <br>

Still, fascinating! Thanks for sharing. <br>

Honestly, I never found fart jokes funny. People have tried to explain to me why they did find them funny, but even with the explanation I&#x27;ve never had a moment where I was like &quot;oh yeah, that makes some sense&quot;, which I usually have when it comes to other jokes I don&#x27;t get immediately.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m not saying this to argue whether fart jokes are actually funny or not, because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an objective answer to that; I just want to provide another data point that humor is very subjective and therefore agree very much with the sentiment that there are no universal jokes.<br>

My brother told about a time some year back he was in Sudan, completely lost.  He was looking for a certain primary school.  This was quite a dangerous area to drive around in because there were no roads but there were lots of old landmines and other unexploded ordinance.<br>
<p>
They arrived at a village, but no one had a shared language.  So they&#x27;re trying to for directions to the  school through pantomime.<br>
<p>
They weren&#x27;t making any progress until this two year old kid comes up.  This kid is not wearing a stitch of clothing.  The kid farts and wanders away nonchalantly.  Everyone falls apart laughing.  Universal humor.<br>

Even amongst native English speakers, words can vary in meaning (&amp; offensiveness.) In the UK, &quot;Going for a fag&quot; is quite innocuos (&quot;I&#x27;m going to smoke a cigarette&quot;). But I believe in the USA that phrase can mean something quite different. The phrase &quot;Two countries separated by a common language&quot; is often used to describe the differences between the UK &amp; USA.<br>
<p>
Culture &amp; context are so important in language (&amp; humour) and it&#x27;s very hard for humour to travel - just ask any professional comedian. Then, when you add into the mix that many people aren&#x27;t native speakers of English and trying to understand this sutble word-play, it gets even harder.<br>
<p>
Words&#x27; meaning &amp; culture change over time and at different speeds in different countries. Going back to my example, &quot;fag&quot; used to be a homophobic slur in the UK but now it&#x27;s just slang for cigarrette* whereas in the USA I believe it still maintains the homophobic connotations.<br>
<p>
And this cultural context issue don&#x27;t just apply to words. In many parts of the world, the thumbs up Emoji means &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;. In some parts of the world, this emoji is deeply offensive. We&#x27;ve had support tickets asking us to remove the thumbs up emoji from systems because of its offensiveness.<br>
<p>
TL;DR Writing for an international audience is very hard and humour is an order of magnitude harder. <br>
<p>
* - Fag, in the UK, also has other meanings but it&#x27;s mostly used to refer to cigarettes.<br>

<p>
It&#x27;s complicated and depends on who you ask.<br>
<p>
In general, it is a slur in US English, and will not be understood* to mean &quot;cigarette.&quot; In some circles, there have been attempts to reclaim it in various ways (most of which keep the base meaning of &quot;a homosexual man&quot; but seek to change the connotations). Not everyone agrees that this is desirable or practical.** Regardless, it should never be used as a pejorative, and it&#x27;s probably unwise to use it in any context where it might be mistaken for a pejorative. I would also respectfully suggest that straight people may want to steer clear of this discourse, unless they are deeply involved with LGBTQ+ activism and have a thorough understanding of all of the relevant issues.***<br>
<p>
* Unless the listener or reader recognizes that you&#x27;re not speaking US English in the first place.<br>
** This is mostly because it&#x27;s still used pejoratively by some (small but extremely vocal) groups in the US. Many people still have strong negative feelings about this word because it was wielded against them in childhood or sometimes adulthood, and in many cases this is only one part of a broad campaign of physical or emotional abuse.<br>
*** Look, if you want to put your foot in your mouth, nobody is going to stop you. But we&#x27;re also not going to give you a break for being ignorant. If you deliberately jump in at the deep end, you are expected to know how to swim.<br>

A word of caution in case anyone not well versed in British English takes this as gospel and attempts to employ it in practice - this is <em>highly</em> context dependent. Don't try to be clever about using this word in the UK. If you use it in a context where "cigarette" is a good-faith interpretation of the word, that's how people will interpret it. But the slur form is also well understood and used (either as a slur or as a reclaimed word).

Yeah, &quot;now it&#x27;s just slang for cigarette&quot; implies that if you were to tell somebody they &quot;look like a fag&quot; you&#x27;d just be suggesting they resemble a cigarette (tall and thin maybe?) and that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;ll be doing at all.<br>

Practically? Possibly.<br>
<p>
It appears the etymology&#x27;s independent. Having poked around on en.wiktionary.org:<br>
<p>
The &quot;gay man&quot; usage is a contraction of &quot;faggot&quot;, which as well as meaning &quot;bundle of sticks&quot;, &quot;bundle of metal rods&quot;, &quot;burning ember&quot;, and &quot;English meatball&quot; also came to mean &quot;shrewish woman&quot; and later (I dare say by extension of the &quot;shrewish woman&quot; sense, with some possible influence from a Yiddish term &quot;feygele&quot; which means &quot;little bird&quot;, &quot;loved one&quot;, and (offensively) &quot;homosexual man&quot;) came to mean &quot;homosexual and/or effeminate man&quot;.<br>
<p>
The &quot;cigarette&quot; usage appears to me to be likely to be a back-construction from using &quot;fag-end&quot; (a very old term meaning &quot;remnant or worst portion&quot;, etymologically distinct from the above) to refer to the unsmoked remnant of a cigarette.<br>

No, the word as used most commonly in literature before the cigarette slang, meant junior boarding school boys who had chores for seniors.  All intended to be character building and young gentleman would never abuse such power, would they?<br>
You can contort any words for cigarette to be homophobic following your argument, which disproves it by reductio ad absurdum.<br>

As a student of various languages, though, I can tell you that when you are finally able to “get” jokes in your non-native language, it’s glorious. We shouldn’t deprive people of that joy, even if it does cause the occasional inconvenience. <br>

The miscommunications will happen anyway in a diverse environment. It’s much better if we can learn to laugh at them instead of automatically taking offense. <br>

As the person who initially added that particular message about thirty years ago, I&#x27;ll say that I also thought it had been replaced with something like &quot;lp%d unknown error (on fire, eh?)&quot; to preserve a bad joke while being unlikely to freak people out.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;d fully support removing all reference to fire, but at this point, who even has a parallel port any more? If a joke falls flat in a forest, and there is no one around to hear it, does it matter that no one laughed at it?<br>

With all the Power Delivery stuff going on, it would even be as accurate as the printer fire (when paper gets stuck, the same location will receive more and more heat, hence the fire).<br>

To be honest it was pretty accurate in my case. Back in the day I had a short in wiring on a parallel port in the printer cable. I got this message in dmesg which was followed shortly by a smoke from the computer case.<br>

Even in academia &quot;iff&quot; is not always known to everybody. If your target audience consists of mathematicians, philosophers, theoretical physicists and/or some subset of computer scientists, you may be able to use it without explanation. But even when writing a scientific paper to wider audience (fields outside of those mentioned), it is considered good form to either always expand it to &quot;if and only if&quot;, or at the very least to define the abbreviation at it&#x27;s first usage in the paper.<br>
<p>
In code, where typos are vastly more common than scientific notation, I would always want to avoid &quot;iff&quot;. Because either it doesn&#x27;t matter that the reverse arrow is also true in that comment, and then you can just use a plain &quot;if&quot;, or it does matter, and then &quot;if and only if&quot; is so much clearer to everyone.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;d maybe think differently about this if the abbreviation for &quot;if and only if&quot; were some word that wasn&#x27;t so close to a typo that people who didn&#x27;t understand it would at least think of putting it into a search engine. For example, in German, &quot;if and only if&quot; is &quot;genau dann, wenn&quot; while a plain &quot;if&quot; is &quot;wenn&quot; -- so people sometimes use &quot;gdw&quot; as an abbreviation. But Germans who&#x27;ve never heard of &quot;gdw&quot; won&#x27;t mistake it for a different German word, because it&#x27;s not that close to anything that it could be a typo, so they&#x27;ll probably put it into a search engine. People who&#x27;ve never heard of &quot;iff&quot;, on the other hand, will most definitely think that it&#x27;s just a typo for &quot;if&quot; -- native speaker or not.<br>

I always seen the similarity of &quot;iff&quot; to &quot;if&quot; more as an advantage, especially when it is used carefully. I agree that when the difference really matters, &quot;if and only if&quot; is much cleaner, but often is doesn&#x27;t matter and is more of an additional remark. Then using &quot;iff&quot; adds a small bit of additional context for everyone who understands it, while the important part is still perfectly readable for everyone else (even if it looks like a typo).<br>

My granddad once complained to me about the quality of language in newspapers these days, eg, an article that said something was becoming &quot;curiouser and curiouser&quot;. I had to explain that was a quote from Alice in Wonderland.  But in an international context, one must accept that misspellings have limited scope for humour. <br>
<p>
I have come across &quot;borken&quot; but it&#x27;s more commonly &quot;borked&quot;; as for &quot;histerical raisins&quot;, ESR&#x27;s jargon file spells it &quot;hysterical&quot; (a play on &quot;historical reasons&quot;, which I didn&#x27;t know), and I don&#x27;t see the humour in the additional misspelling of &quot;histerical&quot;.  <br>
<p>
In short: most of this &quot;humour&quot; is lame anyway. There&#x27;s no harm in fixing it!  <br>

I agree, and I also think that removing humor for being lame, it&#x27;s not a good reason, because  someone had to judge if someone else humour is lame or not, but there is no objective rules for lameness in humour. Some jokes resonate with some reader and not with someone else, but this is not a reason per se to avoid it.<br>
<p>
I suspect that humour is like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder. <br>

<p>
Basically this. Most of the “hacker humour” is _painfully_ unfunny, and that includes all of examples in the article. It was maybe funny back in the 80s, but in 2021? It’s just cringy.<br>

I like the practice used in printing of adding &quot;(sic)&quot;, with or without an exclamation mark, to make it clear that this is indeed intended. Then you would be spared well-intentioned but ultimately useless patches.<br>
<p>
So:<br>
<p>
-			pr_err(&quot;BUG: arch topology borken\n&quot;);<br>
+			pr_err(&quot;BUG: arch topology borken\n&quot;); /* (sic!) */<br>

      Yeah, a simple comment would solve all issues IMO, anyone thinking about writing a patch can see the comment and not waste further time on it while the joke still stays and in the wild the explanation doesn't "ruins" it, as it's compiled out there anyway.

I think humor is a *good* thing, but it would be good to avoid wasting everyone&#x27;s time in &quot;fixing&quot; it. Adding &quot;sic&quot; is a good idea. If they don&#x27;t know what that means, they can just search for &quot;sic&quot; and find more information. There&#x27;s even a Wikipedia page:<br>

A related problem is people denoting half-open intervals with the mathematical convention, [0..INT_MAX); I&#x27;ve seen a number of patches &quot;correcting&quot; the ) to a ].  Really not sure what to do about that, since clearly it&#x27;s not a well-understood convention.<br>

That convention also suffers from not beeing universal. I was introduced to writing half-open intervals as [0..INT_MAX[ and got confused when I first came across the [..) style.<br>

I was very fortunate that my high school math teacher taught us both conventions, so I was never surprised by either. But regardless of which of these conventions is used in the comment of the code, you&#x27;ll get corrections for both if the reader doesn&#x27;t understand that the author meant a half-open interval (or doesn&#x27;t even know that such a thing exists).<br>
<p>
I personally tend to write [0..INT_MAX-1] to be extra clear, because the ) in [0, INT_MAX) could theoretically even be a typo -- on German keyboard layouts &quot;]&quot; is &quot;AltGr + 9&quot;, while &quot;)&quot; is &quot;Shift + 9&quot;.<br>

This reminds me of a time when I was still a child visiting a website back in the mid 90s, and the web server returned an error message &quot;Broken pipe&quot; (alongside a 500 error code). I did have some minimal experience with computers back then, but was still just starting out; and I believed that this error message meant that the data center hosting the server was met with a plumbing disaster. ;-) I actually felt really sorry for the sysadmins at that data center for having to deal with water damage in their equipment.<br>
<p>
I spoke English to a level as close to a native speaker as can be at the time (factoring in my age as a child, obviously), having lived in England during very formative years as a child and having just moved away a year or so before that story took place, so this specific language barrier I encountered was not related to me not knowing English well enough, but to me not knowing the special meanings of otherwise everyday vocabulary in a computing context well enough back then.<br>
<p>
I hence don&#x27;t think you can ever get rid of all language barriers, even if you were only dealing with native speakers. The penultimate paragraph in the article is therefore something that I agree with wholeheartedly.<br>

      This reminds me of a story...I didn't think of this while writing the article.
<p>
Way back in the prehistoric past, the University of Colorado's first VAX 11/780 lived a schizophrenic existence: to meet the demands of various faculty members, it toggled between VMS and an early BSD distribution in the late afternoon each day.  This was effected by shutting down and swapping the disk pack in an RP06 drive....those were the days.
<p>
I was lucky enough to be able to mess around with this machine, and was tasked with porting a Fortran program from the VMS side over to Unix.  With some effort I got the file (let's call it <tt>FOO.FOR</tt>) onto the Unix disk, and struggled through enough <tt>vi</tt> (straight from the fingers of Bill Joy) to make some changes to it.  Then it came time to do the compilation.  Some research turned up the fact that the Fortran compiler was called <tt>f77</tt>, so I typed:
<p>
<pre>
    $ f77 foo.for
</pre>
<p>
You'll see I'd already gotten into the Unix mindset by renaming the file to lower case.  The system helpfully answered:
<p>
<pre>
  foo.for: bad magic number
</pre>
<p>
I immediately faulted my undergrad teachers for not teaching me about magic numbers...perhaps the problem was that I was actually studying EE, where magic numbers are not generally welcomed.  Then I went and asked a grad student for help.
<p>
The real problem, of course, the thing the system was trying to tell me, is that my file had the wrong extension — it should have been <tt>foo.f</tt>.  Since the compiler didn't recognize the extension, it simply passed the file name through to the linker which, upon failing to find an indentifying code for the "object" file it had been passed, complained at me.  Once the file was renamed things worked, and my Unix experience had truly begun.

I&#x27;ve several times performed stand-up comedy about the free and open source software industry at tech conferences. I always rehearse in front of a preview audience; for a recent performance at ÖzgürKon (a virtual international conference, organized by FLOSS enthusiasts in Turkey), I rehearsed several times via videocall and included people from multiple countries in my preview audiences. I&#x27;m from the US. I asked them to specifically tell me what jokes they did not understand, and what jokes they thought would not land well with people from outside the US, either because of incomprehension or because it might rub them the wrong way. I took that feedback and modified or removed stuff and wrote new material to replace it. And my final performance (30 minutes long) worked well and made people from multiple countries laugh.<br>
<p>
There are lots of kinds of humor in the world. Wordplay is one (and I love it and engage in it when conversing with people fluent in my language). Sarcasm is another. In-group cultural references are another. Those can be shorter -- more amenable to being used in a short code comment, an error message or a name -- but a bit harder to notice and understand as jokes to someone who doesn&#x27;t have background context. On the other hand, observational humor, self-deprecation, and anecdotes often carry more context with them, but are necessarily longer, more suitable for longer code comments. People who would like to use humor in their code comments but would like to avoid unnecessarily confusing some readers might like to try out observational humor, self-deprecation, and anecdotes as tools to employ. Plus, a winky-face emoticon carries fairly useful intent metadata...<br>

The problem here is really a particular kind of humor: word play and puns, which do not cross language barriers, and do look like typos for non-native speakers (or even native speakers unfamiliar with hacker jargon). Instead of banning humor, more universal kind could be encouraged?<br>

I think humour is alright in comments and error messages as long as it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of clarity. This is especially true for error messages where the last thing you want to do is frustrate the person trying to debug a problem indicated by the error message even more.<br>

      I really like this one from backalong, which I first saw in the venerable <b>fortune</b> quote of the day:

<blockquote>
<p>The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793... at every appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.
</p>
<p>
This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.
</p>

      Once upon a time the shutdown.c code in sysvinit had some code that went like:

<Pre>
char *shutdown_msg;
if (strcmp(username, "tyler") == 0) {
  shutdown_msg = "well hello mister Tyler ... going down?";
} else {
  shutdown_msg = "system going down";
}
</Pre>

Even in the 90s or early 2000s, someone found this, decided it was not appropriate, and sent in a patch to remove that particular attempt at humour.

<p>Hey, popular hit songs usually have a finite shelf life.  For those who still don't quite get the humor, it's a <a href="https://youtu.be/h3Yrhv33Zb8?t=10">spoken quote</a> near the beginning of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_an_Elevator">hit song from 1989</a>.</p>

It often strikes me as odd how jargon-filled the language around inclusiveness is and also how it&#x27;s extremely specific to the US and certain sensibilities. <br>

Yeah, there&#x27;s no hard and fast rule but the more offensive the slang and the deeper the wound, the more culture-specific they tend to be. So while paved with all the best intentions, some &quot;universal&quot; inclusiveness efforts can be actually naive and narrow minded.<br>
<p>
In fact culture and language differences can be felt even inside the US. Social media: people separated by a common language and talking across each other.<br>
<p>
To be fairer with this document the &quot;avoid being too culturally specific to the US&quot; does not seem to be about language. The examples given are holidays, sports and figures of speech. They should add boustrophedon dates, calendars with split &quot;week-ends&quot; and of course non-decimal units :-)<br>

The problem I have is that I as a non-native speaker have is to keep up on the ever-changing landscape of words that are replaced in the name of inclusiveness, while also having to maintain a dictionary in my head for when I encounter those terms that are now deemed non-inclusive. It&#x27;s like having to learn a new language all over. That is what I meant by jargon. And it also leaves me feeling bad because if someone took the time to record what might offend people, have I been hurting people all the time without intent?<br>
<p>
To me it seems a bit silly and paternalistic, I was orphaned at a young age as the result of murder but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m traumatized anytime anyone uses the word &quot;orphan&quot; or &quot;kill&quot; or &quot;shoot the other node in the head&quot; - and even if I was, as long as it wasn&#x27;t the intent of the other party, it is on me to deal with those issues. <br>

Most of that is benign, and I think the reader should be given some credit. If I don&#x27;t understand a metaphor I can look it up. It does not offend me if someone doesn&#x27;t use the metric system, on the other side it would be a pain for me to have to convert all the units I use to some other system - we have computers for that. <br>

While politics are complicated and messy, the technical solution to this problem is dead-simple:<br>
<p>
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --codespell --dictionary inclusive_US_english<br>
<p>
Problem solved, back to work.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve been asking a couple inclusion &quot;authorities&quot; for such a  machine-usable dictionary. I haven&#x27;t even asked any of them to agree with each other and produce a single one, after all it would be trivial to just:<br>
<p>
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --codespell --dictionary inclusive_US_english1<br>
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --codespell --dictionary inclusive_US_english2<br>
...<br>
<p>

The problem with that is --dictionary inclusive_GB_English<br>
<p>
There&#x27;s more than a few words that have VERY different meanings depending on which version of English you are using. And what happens when a word is in inclusive_GB but exclusive_US, or vice-versa?<br>
<p>
The only solution that works is &quot;try not to give offense, be slow to take offense&quot;. The first is not always possible! and the second is needed to defuse failures. (And the reason the first is not always possible, is there are FAR too many people for whom the second does not apply. One only has to look at the discussion about fags to see why.)<br>

Spell checkers etc don&#x27;t force you to use certain words, true, but if your words are in someone else&#x27;s exclusive dictionary then it makes it impossible to communicate ...<br>

Understood: finding common language can be difficult when discussing sensitive topics. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t expect to ever have to use &quot;African American&quot; in source code and no one has requested to rename red-black trees yet.

It might help if people whose first language is not English were less eager to submit spelling and grammar corrections.  In recent weeks I&#x27;ve seen quite a spate of patches of this kind on the netdev list, of which a considerable proportion have been erroneous; most of them haven&#x27;t been missing jokes but simply showing their limited understanding of the English language.  (For a representative example, see [1].)  I don&#x27;t know what has caused these to appear all of a sudden.<br>
<p>
While this isn&#x27;t putting any strain on reviewers that can&#x27;t be borne, I can&#x27;t help but feel that these submitters are making an inefficient use of their _own_ time and effort, and that they would serve both themselves and the project better if they focused on tasks where the language barrier put them at less of a disadvantage.<br>

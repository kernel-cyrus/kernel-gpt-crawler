<h1>TCP vulnerability: cancel red alert</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 21, 2004 by corbet]

               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The mainstream press has been quick to proclaim a new vulnerability which
threatens the entire Internet.  CNN, for example, tells us: "<a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/04/20/internet.threat/index.html">Flaw
could shut down Internet traffic</a>".  A bit of time spent actually
understanding the problem will quickly make it clear, for most
users, there is little to worry about.
<p>

There are several parameters which identify a particular TCP packet.  The
<i>source</i> and <i>destination addresses</i> are exactly that: who sent
the packet, and who is to receive it.  The <i>destination port number</i>
allows the packet to be routed to the proper process on the receiving
system; on the server side of a connection, the destination port will
usually be a well-known number assigned to a specific service.  For
example, the process which receives electronic mail will be expecting it to
arrive on port 25.  The <i>source port</i> identifies the process which
sent the packet.  On the client (initiating) side of a connection, the
source port is ostensibly a random number, though, in practice, they tend
to be assigned in a sequential (and thus predictable) way.  Yet another
parameter is the <i>sequence number</i>, which describes where the packet
fits within the overall stream.  The initial sequence numbers for a
connection are assigned randomly; they then increase as data is sent over
the connection.
<p>

TCP packets also have a "flags" field for control purposes.  One of those
flags is called "reset" or "RST"; it indicates that the sending side is
shutting down the connection immediately.  Resets typically happen when one
side receives a packet for a connection it knows nothing about.  Suppose
you log into a remote system with ssh, then go out for lunch; while you are
eating, the remote system is rebooted.  When you return and try to type
over the connection, the remote system will have no record of it, so it
will send back a reset packet.  That's when 
you get that fun "connection reset by peer" message.  

<p>

Suppose you were an Internet vandal looking to shut down other people's
connections.  This could be accomplished by sending the right sort of reset
packet.  Crafting this packet is not an entirely easy thing to do: you have
to match all five of the parameters listed above.  Presumably coming up
with source and destination addresses would not be too hard, if you know
which connection you are targeting.  One of the two port numbers will
probably be a well-known service number, and thus easily accessible.  The
other port number will require a guess, but the range of possible numbers
is, in many cases, small.  The hardest part is the sequence number; it is a
randomly-chosen, 32-bit number.  In the past, poor initial sequence number
generation has allowed protocol attacks, but most of those problems are
long since fixed.  To mount a reset attack against a modern TCP
implementation, the attacker must work through the entire space of
4&nbsp;billion possible sequence numbers; by the time that has been
accomplished, chances are the target connection will have shut down
normally anyway.
<p>

Except, as it turns out, that is not entirely true.  TCP uses a "receive
window" to control the flow of data.  The window gives a range of sequence
numbers for which the destination is prepared to receive data; this window
can vary widely between systems, but 32KB is a fairly common size.  Since
the two sides of a TCP connection may not share the exact same idea of what
the current sequence number is (one side may have sent packets that the
other has not received), a reset packet with a sequence number that falls
anywhere inside the receive window will be honored.  Thus an attacker need
not try every possible sequence number; attempts may, instead, be spaced as
widely as the probable receive window.  That changes the situation
significantly; if the other four parameters are correct, a usable sequence
number can be found with less than 100,000 attempts.  It does not take very
long to send that many (very short) packets, even over a relatively slow
connection. 

<p>
So, a dedicated attacker stands a fairly good chance of shutting down a
connection.  What are the implications of this?  Very few, for the most
part.  In general, the damage caused by a prematurely closed connection is
small; the user swears and restarts their download operation.  It would be
hard to use this technique to shut down a web server; HTTP connections tend
to be short-lived to begin with.  That is why the largest threat is seen to
be for applications which use long-lived TCP connections for some important
task.  The BGP protocol used for much of the core Internet routing is one
such case; most of the affected systems have already been fixed, however.  

<p>
For those who
are in a situation where this sort of attack could pose a threat, there are
a few things which can be done, including 
using IPSec, which is not vulnerable to this sort of problem, or 
configuring networking to use a smaller window size (but be aware that
performance can be reduced).  The IETF has also come up with <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcpsecure-00.txt">
a proposed protocol change</a> which addresses the problem: when a reset
packet is received which, while falling within the receive window, does not
exactly match the sequence number, the receiving side will send an
acknowledgment rather than immediately resetting the connection.  That
acknowledgment will contain the current sequence number as seen by the
side receiving the reset, which will allow the sending of a second reset
packet with the exact sequence number.
<p>
Some vendors (mostly router manufacturers) are issuing software updates to
implement the IETF suggestion.  Most of us, however, can sit back and look
for something else to worry about.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      When I am writing a networked application (I am a Software Engineer), one of the first things on my design checklist is: &quot;What if the network connection goes down?&quot; (Put that next to &quot;What information will be exposed to the net?&quot; and &quot;How do we restrict remote administration to a trusted set of people?&quot;)<br>With a little care it is possible to make an application that handles loss of connectivity gracefully, this &quot;session layer&quot; vulnarability should not be a problem to a sanely written application.

      That's fine for most things but for BGP it's a problem.  BGP is driven by announcemnts - routers announce to their peers the routes they are providing.  If the TCP connection is reset a router has to remove the announcements that peer was making to it.  This could easily cause loss of connectivity for large portions of the Internet.

      I'm feeling somewhat uncomfortable when reading more about BGP: It looks like the protocol is also sensitive to data insertion attacks. Would it be possible to reroute the TCP connection you attack through a man-in-the-middle router? I really need some tea now to get the bad taste out of my mouth!

      Most BGP operators use MD5 signatures on their BGP sessions, using a shared secret between the two BGP peers.  This effectively adds fairly string authentication over the connection.  It also mitigates this attack.  The recent NANOG discussion covers this.

      A protocol change seems overkill for a problem that should be rather simple to fix. Any of these would do:<p>- Make ISPs implement ingress filtering to kill off spoofed source addresses. This is good against all DoS attacks, and I really don't understand why there's not more pressure to do so. Pressure == refusal to peer with ISPs without filtering.<p>- More randomness in transient port selection. Would make this kind of guessing a few orders of magnitude harder, ie. not practical. I mean, this is hardly a new attack it just haven't been considered practical before.<p>- Specifically protecting BGP or other vulnerable protocols by either (1) ingress source filtering, (2) ingress TTL filtering (3) md5 signing of packets<p>Finally, to quote (from memory) davem: Anyone who suggests replying to an RST doesn't understand tcp.

<p>

This doesn't work except at the very edge of the network.  And it creates problems with multi-homed networks where traffic could be going out one connection and back in another.  It can't be used on the core of anyones network at all, which is where this type of attack would be most effective.  <a href=http://www.nanog.org>NANOG</a> has had extensive discussions on this subject in the last few months - see their mailing lists.  NANOG has also been discussing this problem for the last few days.
<p>
Also, with the large number of Zombie systems out there, spoofing IP addresses is not needed for DDoS attacks.

      All true. Anti-spoof-filtering must be done at the edge. Very few ISPs currently do this, because there is no pressure for them to do so. There is no advantage in doing it. But if everybody did, everybody would be better off. Prisoner's dilemma. Needs &quot;outside&quot; pressure to get to best solution.<p>Regarding DoS though, while a DoS doesn't require spoofed source addresses, it does make it much much harder to stop.

      <i>This doesn't work except at the very edge of the network.
</i>
<p>
Doing it at the edge would probably be sufficient.  

<p>In fact, I thought it already was already done there.  Can an AOL or Earthlink or Road Runner home Internet user send packets with arbitrary source IP addresses into the Internet?  Have we had Internet hacks recently using spoofed IP source addresses?

<p>It doesn't have to be the <i>very</i> edge, does it?  Just beyond the point where the Internet becomes a tree.  I assume most of the Internet nodes are in that outer region.

      Thanks for a very clear explanation; I've sort of gleaned lots of this from other sources, but it's nice to see it all in one place. Now what I don't understand much at all is 1) What is BGP and 2) Why is it so vulnerable to this attack. That'd make another great LWN article, I think.<p>Thanks,<p>Eric<br>

      In short: BGP (specifically BGP-4) is *the* routing protocol used on the Internet.  Think of it as the great-great-great grandnephew of RIP.  Network Service Providers and Internet Service Providers use it to advertise IP address reachability to each other.  Routers run the protocol between themselves over TCP connections.  It's not all that vulnerable to attack - it's biggest problem is that it can be extremely complex to configure properly, which can lead to routing problems across the Internet.<p>BGP-4 is a standard from the IETF.

      OK! I see the vulnerability and its proposed IETF fix. Is this fix in Linux kernel?<p>

      David S. Miller says on the lkml &quot;Anyone who recommends responding to a RST packet, does not understand TCP very well.&quot;<br>

      <blockquote><i>"Anyone who recommends responding to a RST packet, does

<p> 
I agree, so I don't understand why the IETF and Cisco people are pushing 
this "fix".  Why do the Linux (and OpenBSD) people see this as a bad idea 
but not the Cisco people?

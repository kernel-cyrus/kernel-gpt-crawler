Video4Linux2 (V4L2) drivers provide access to webcams, TV tuners, and TV
output devices, among others.  LWN <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/203924/">covered much of the V4L2 API</a> in
2007; sadly, like almost any two-year-old kernel documentation, those
articles are now somewhat obsolete.  One thing that has not changed,
though, is that V4L2
drivers tend to be moderately complex beasts; they are usually an assembly
of two or three drivers working together to operate hardware with a number
of complex operating modes.  Despite all that, a V4L2 driver has, at its core, a
relatively simple task: fill large buffers in memory with video frames and
transfer them between the device and user space.  The management of these
buffers, while subject to complexities of its own, tends to be quite
similar from one driver to the next.  It would be nice if there were a
support layer which could be used to handle much of this task in a standard
way.
<p>
The good news is that such a layer does exist; it's called videobuf.  The
bad news is that the documentation for this code is...not quite what it
could be.  This article is an attempt to fill that gap; a version of it
will eventually be submitted for inclusion into the kernel documentation
directory.
<p>
The videobuf layer functions as a sort of glue layer between a V4L2 driver
and user space.  It handles the allocation and management of buffers for
the storage of video frames.  There is a set of functions which can be used
to implement many of the standard POSIX I/O system calls, including
<tt>read()</tt>, <tt>poll()</tt>, and, happily, <tt>mmap()</tt>.  Another
set of functions can be used to implement the bulk of the V4L2
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls related to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/240667/">streaming I/O</a>, including buffer
allocation, queueing and dequeueing, and streaming control.  Using videobuf
imposes a few design decisions on the driver author, but the payback comes
in the form of reduced code in the driver and a consistent implementation
of the V4L2 user-space API.
<p>
<h4>Buffer types</h4>
<p>
Not all video devices use the same kind of buffers.  In fact, there are (at
least) three common variations:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Buffers which are scattered in both the physical and (kernel) virtual 
     address spaces.  All user-space buffers are like this, but it makes
     great sense to allocate kernel-space buffers this way as well when it
     is possible.  Unfortunately, it is not always possible; working with
     this kind of buffer normally requires hardware which can 
     do scatter/gather DMA operations.
<p>
<li> Buffers which are physically scattered, but which are virtually
     contiguous; buffers allocated with <tt>vmalloc()</tt>, in other
     words.  These buffers are just as hard to use for DMA operations, but
     they can be useful in situations where DMA is not available but
     virtually-contiguous buffers are convenient.
<p>
<li> Buffers which are physically contiguous.  Allocation of this kind of
     buffer can be unreliable on fragmented systems, but simpler DMA
     controllers cannot deal with anything else.
</ul>
<p>
Videobuf can work with all three types of buffers, but the driver author
must pick one at the outset and design the driver around that decision.
<p>
<h4>Data structures, callbacks, and initialization</h4>
<p>
Depending on which
type of buffers are being used, the driver should include one of the
following files:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;media/videobuf-dma-sg.h&gt;
    &lt;media/videobuf-vmalloc.h&gt;
    &lt;media/videobuf-dma-contig.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The driver's data structure describing a V4L2 device should include a
<tt>struct videobuf_queue</tt>
instance for the management of the buffer queue, along with a <tt>list_head</tt>
for the queue of available buffers.  There will also need to be an
interrupt-safe spinlock which is used to protect (at least) the queue.
<p>
The next step is to write four simple callbacks to help videobuf deal with
the management of buffers:
<p>
<pre>
    struct videobuf_queue_ops {
	int (*buf_setup)(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			 unsigned int *count, unsigned int *size);
	int (*buf_prepare)(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			   struct videobuf_buffer *vb,
			   enum v4l2_field field);
	void (*buf_queue)(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			  struct videobuf_buffer *vb);
	void (*buf_release)(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			    struct videobuf_buffer *vb);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<tt>buf_setup()</tt> is called early in the I/O process, when streaming is
being initiated; its purpose is to tell videobuf about the I/O stream.  The
<tt>count</tt> parameter will be a suggested number of buffers to use; the
driver should check it for rationality and adjust it if need be.  As a
practical rule, a minimum of two buffers are needed for proper streaming,
and there is usually a maximum (which cannot exceed 32) which makes sense
for each device.  The 
<tt>size</tt> parameter should be set to the expected (maximum) size for
each frame of data.
<p>
Each buffer (in the form of a <tt>struct videobuf_buffer</tt> pointer) will
be passed to <tt>buf_prepare()</tt>, which should set the buffer's
<tt>size</tt>, <tt>width</tt>, <tt>height</tt>, and <tt>field</tt>
fields properly.  If the buffer's <tt>state</tt> field is
<tt>VIDEOBUF_NEEDS_INIT</tt>, the driver should pass it to:
<p>
<pre>
    int videobuf_iolock(struct videobuf_queue* q, struct videobuf_buffer *vb,
			struct v4l2_framebuffer *fbuf);
</pre>
<p>
Among other things, this call will usually allocate memory for the buffer.
Finally, the <tt>buf_prepare()</tt> function should set the buffer's
<tt>state</tt> to <tt>VIDEOBUF_PREPARED</tt>.
<p>
When a buffer is queued for I/O, it is passed to <tt>buf_queue()</tt>,
which should put it onto the driver's list of available buffers and set its
state to <tt>VIDEOBUF_QUEUED</tt>.  Note that this function is called with
the queue spinlock held; if it tries to acquire it as well things will come
to a screeching halt.  Yes, this is the voice of experience.  Note also
that videobuf may wait on the first buffer in the queue; placing other
buffers in front of it could again gum up the works.  So use
<tt>list_add_tail()</tt> to enqueue buffers.
<p>
Finally, <tt>buf_release()</tt> is called when a buffer is no longer
intended to be used.  The driver should ensure that there is no I/O active
on the buffer, then pass it to the appropriate free routine(s):
<p>
<pre>
    /* Scatter/gather drivers */
    int videobuf_dma_unmap(struct videobuf_queue *q,
    			   struct videobuf_dmabuf *dma);
    int videobuf_dma_free(struct videobuf_dmabuf *dma);

    /* vmalloc drivers */
    void videobuf_vmalloc_free (struct videobuf_buffer *buf);

    /* Contiguous drivers */
    void videobuf_dma_contig_free(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			          struct videobuf_buffer *buf);
</pre>
<p>
One way to ensure that a buffer is no longer under I/O is to pass it to:
<p>
<pre>
    int videobuf_waiton(struct videobuf_buffer *vb, int non_blocking, int intr);
</pre>
<p>

Here, <tt>vb</tt> is the buffer, <tt>non_blocking</tt> indicates whether
non-blocking I/O should be used (it should be zero in the
<tt>buf_release()</tt> case), and <tt>intr</tt> controls whether an
interruptible wait is used.
<p>

<h4>File operations</h4>
<p>
At this point, much of the work is done; much of the rest is slipping
videobuf calls into the implementation of the other driver callbacks.  The
first step is in the <tt>open()</tt> function, which must initialize the
videobuf queue.  The function to use depends on the type of buffer used:
<p>
<pre>
    void videobuf_queue_sg_init(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			        struct videobuf_queue_ops *ops,
			 	struct device *dev,
			 	spinlock_t *irqlock,
			 	enum v4l2_buf_type type,
			 	enum v4l2_field field,
			 	unsigned int msize,
			 	void *priv);

    void videobuf_queue_vmalloc_init(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			        struct videobuf_queue_ops *ops,
			 	void *dev,
			 	spinlock_t *irqlock,
			 	enum v4l2_buf_type type,
			 	enum v4l2_field field,
			 	unsigned int msize,
				void *priv);

    void videobuf_queue_dma_contig_init(struct videobuf_queue *q,
				       struct videobuf_queue_ops *ops,
				       struct device *dev,
				       spinlock_t *irqlock,
				       enum v4l2_buf_type type,
				       enum v4l2_field field,
				       unsigned int msize,
				       void *priv);
</pre>

<p>
In each case, the parameters are the same: <tt>q</tt> is the queue
structure for the device, <tt>ops</tt> is the set of callbacks as described
above, <tt>dev</tt> is the <tt>device</tt> structure for this video device,
<tt>irqlock</tt> is an interrupt-safe spinlock to protect access to the
data structures, <tt>type</tt> is the buffer type used by the device
(cameras will use <tt>V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE</tt>, for example),
<tt>field</tt> describes which field is being captured (often
<tt>V4L2_FIELD_NONE</tt> for progressive devices), <tt>msize</tt> is the
size of any containing structure used around <tt>struct
videobuf_buffer</tt>, and <tt>priv</tt> is a private data pointer which
shows up in the <tt>priv_data</tt> field of <tt>struct
videobuf_queue</tt>.  Note that these are <tt>void</tt> functions which,
evidently, are immune to failure.
<p>
The <tt>void *dev</tt> typing in videobuf_queue_vmalloc_init() is a bit of
an anomaly; your editor has submitted a patch to change it to
<tt>struct&nbsp;device&nbsp;*</tt>.  The <tt>ops</tt> pointer also should
really be <tt>const</tt>; that will probably change in 2.6.33.

<p>
V4L2 capture drivers can be written to support either of two APIs: the
<tt>read()</tt> system call and the rather more complicated streaming
mechanism.  As a general rule, it is necessary to support both to ensure
that all applications have a chance of working with the device. 
Videobuf makes it easy to do that with the same code.  To
implement <tt>read()</tt>, the driver need only make a call to one of:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t videobuf_read_one(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			      char __user *data, size_t count, 
			      loff_t *ppos, int nonblocking);

    ssize_t videobuf_read_stream(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			         char __user *data, size_t count, 
				 loff_t *ppos, int vbihack, int nonblocking);
</pre>

<p>
Either one of these functions will read frame data into <tt>data</tt>,
returning the amount actually read; the difference is that
<tt>videobuf_read_one()</tt> will only read a single frame, while
<tt>videobuf_read_stream()</tt> will read multiple frames if they are
needed to satisfy
the <tt>count</tt> requested by the application.  A typical driver
<tt>read()</tt> implementation will start the capture engine, call one of
the above functions, then stop the engine before returning (though a
smarter implementation might leave the engine running for a little
while in anticipation of another <tt>read()</tt> call happening in the near
future).
<p>
The <tt>poll()</tt> function can usually be implemented with a direct call
to:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int videobuf_poll_stream(struct file *file,
				      struct videobuf_queue *q,
				      poll_table *wait);
</pre>
<p>
Note that the actual wait queue eventually used will be the one associated
with the first available buffer.
<p>
When streaming I/O is done to kernel-space buffers, the driver must support
the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call to enable user space to access the data.
In many V4L2 drivers, the often-complex <tt>mmap()</tt> implementation
simplifies to a single call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int videobuf_mmap_mapper(struct videobuf_queue *q,
			     struct vm_area_struct *vma);
</pre>
<p>
Everything else is handled by the videobuf code.
<p>
The <tt>release()</tt> function requires two separate videobuf calls:
<p>
<pre>
    void videobuf_stop(struct videobuf_queue *q);
    int videobuf_mmap_free(struct videobuf_queue *q);
</pre>
<p>
The call to <tt>videobuf_stop()</tt> terminates any I/O in progress -
though it is still up to the driver to stop the capture engine.  The call
to <tt>videobuf_mmap_free()</tt> will ensure that all buffers have been
unmapped; if so, they will all be passed to the <tt>buf_release()</tt>
callback.  If buffers remain mapped, <tt>videobuf_mmap_free()</tt> returns an
error code instead.  The purpose
is clearly to cause the closing of the file descriptor to fail if buffers
are still mapped, but every driver in the 2.6.32 kernel cheerfully ignores
its return value.

<p>
<h4>ioctl() operations</h4>
<p>
The V4L2 API includes a very long list of driver callbacks to respond to
the many <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands made available to user space.  A number
of these - those associated with streaming I/O -  turn almost directly into
videobuf calls.  The relevant helper functions are:
<p>
<pre>
    int videobuf_reqbufs(struct videobuf_queue *q,
		         struct v4l2_requestbuffers *req);
    int videobuf_querybuf(struct videobuf_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b);
    int videobuf_qbuf(struct videobuf_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b);
    int videobuf_dqbuf(struct videobuf_queue *q, struct v4l2_buffer *b, 
                       int nonblocking);
    int videobuf_streamon(struct videobuf_queue *q);
    int videobuf_streamoff(struct videobuf_queue *q);
    int videobuf_cgmbuf(struct videobuf_queue *q, struct video_mbuf *mbuf, 
    			int count);
</pre>
<p>
So, for example, a <tt>VIDIOC_REQBUFS</tt> call turns into a call to the
driver's <tt>vidioc_reqbufs()</tt> callback which, in turn, usually only
needs to locate the proper <tt>struct videobuf_queue</tt> pointer and pass
it to <tt>videobuf_reqbufs()</tt>.  These support functions can replace a
great deal of buffer management boilerplate in a lot of V4L2 drivers.
<p>
The <tt>vidioc_streamon()</tt> and <tt>vidioc_streamoff()</tt> functions
will be a bit more complex, of course, since they will also need to deal
with starting and stopping the capture engine.  <tt>videobuf_cgmbuf()</tt>,
called from the driver's <tt>vidiocgmbuf()</tt> function, only exists if
the V4L1 compatibility module has been selected with
<tt>CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT</tt>, so its use must be surrounded with
<tt>#ifdef</tt> directives.

<p>
<h4>Buffer allocation</h4>
<p>
Thus far, we have talked about buffers, but have not looked at how they are
allocated.    The scatter/gather case is the most complex on
this front.  For allocation, the driver <i>can</i> leave buffer allocation
entirely up to the videobuf layer; in this case, buffers will be allocated
as anonymous user-space pages and will be very scattered indeed.  If the
application 
is using user-space buffers, no allocation is needed; the videobuf layer
will take care of calling <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> and filling in the
scatterlist array.
<p>
If the driver needs to do its own memory allocation, it should be done in
the <tt>vidioc_reqbufs()</tt> function, <i>after</i> calling
<tt>videobuf_reqbufs()</tt>.  The first step is a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    struct videobuf_dmabuf *videobuf_to_dma(struct videobuf_buffer *buf);
</pre>
<p>
The returned <tt>videobuf_dmabuf</tt> structure (defined in
<tt>&lt;media/videobuf-dma-sg.h&gt;</tt>) includes a couple of relevant
fields:
<p>
<pre>
    struct scatterlist  *sglist;
    int                 sglen;
</pre>
<p>
The driver must allocate an appropriately-sized <tt>scatterlist</tt> array
and populate it with pointers to the pieces of the allocated buffer;
<tt>sglen</tt> should be set to the length of the array.
<p>

Drivers using the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> method need not (and cannot) concern
themselves with buffer allocation at all; videobuf will handle those
details.  The same is true of contiguous-DMA drivers; videobuf will
allocate the buffers (with <tt>dma_alloc_coherent()</tt>) when it sees
fit.  That means that these drivers may be trying to do high-order
allocations at any time, an operation which is not always guaranteed to
work.  Some drivers play tricks by allocating DMA space at system boot
time; videobuf does not currently play well with those drivers.

<p>
<h4>Filling the buffers</h4>
<p>
The final part of a videobuf implementation has no direct callback - its
the portion of the code which actually puts frame data into the buffers,
usually in response to interrupts from the device.  For all types of
drivers, this process works approximately as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Obtain the next available buffer and make sure that somebody
     is actually waiting for it.
<p>
<li> Get a pointer to the memory and put video data there.
<p>
<li> Mark the buffer as done and wake up the process waiting for it.
</ol>
<p>
Step (1) above is done by looking at the driver-managed <tt>list_head</tt>
structure - the one which is filled in the <tt>buf_queue()</tt> callback.
Because starting the engine and enqueueing buffers are done in separate
steps, it's possible for the engine to be running without any buffers
available - in the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> case especially.  So the driver
should be prepared for the list to be empty.  It is equally possible that
nobody is yet interested in the buffer; the driver should not remove it
from the list or fill it until
a process is waiting on it.  That test can be done by examining the
buffer's <tt>done</tt> field (a <tt>wait_queue_head_t</tt> structure) with
<tt>waitqueue_active()</tt>.
<p>
For scatter/gather drivers, the needed memory pointers will be found in the
<tt>scatterlist</tt> structure described above.  Drivers using the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> method can get a memory pointer with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *videobuf_to_vmalloc(struct videobuf_buffer *buf);
</pre>
<p>
For contiguous DMA drivers, the function to use is:
<p>
<pre>
    dma_addr_t videobuf_to_dma_contig(struct videobuf_buffer *buf);
</pre>
<p>
The contiguous DMA API goes out of its way to hide the kernel-space address
of the DMA buffer from drivers.
<p>
The final step is to set the <tt>size</tt> field of the relevant
<tt>videobuf_buffer</tt> structure to the actual size of the captured
image, set <tt>state</tt> to <tt>VIDEOBUF_DONE</tt>, then call
<tt>wake_up()</tt> on the <tt>done</tt> queue.  At this point, the buffer
is owned by the videobuf layer and the driver should not touch it again.

<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
This article has covered most aspects of the videobuf API.  Developers who
are interested in more information can go into the relevant header files;
there are a few low-level functions declared there which have not been
talked about here.  Also worthwhile is the vivi driver

how V4L2 drivers should be written.  Vivi only uses the <tt>vmalloc()</tt>
API, but it's good enough to get started with.  Note also that all of these
calls are exported GPL-only, so they will not be available to non-GPL

I'm curious, is it possible to reuse infrastructure used for Buffer Objects in kernel memory managers used by video drivers?<br>

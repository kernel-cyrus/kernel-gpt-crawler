           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 4, 2016</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2016/">LSFMM 2016</a>
</div>
<p>
The proposed <a href="/Articles/394298/"><tt>xstat()</tt> system call</a>,
which is 
meant to extend the functionality of the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html"><tt>stat()</tt></a>
call to get additional file-status information, has been discussed quite a
bit over 
the years, but has never 
been merged.  The main impediment seems to be a lot of bikeshedding about
how much information—and which specific pieces—will be returned.  David
Howells led a short filesystem-only discussion on <tt>xstat()</tt> at the
2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.
</p>

<p>
Howells presented a long list of possibilities that could be added to the
structure for additional file status information to be returned by a call
like <tt>xstat()</tt>—things like larger
timestamps, the creation (or birth) time for a file, data version number
(for some filesystems), inode generation number, and more.  In general,
there are more fields, with some that have grown larger, for <tt>xstat()</tt>.
</p>

</a>

<p>
There is also space at the end of the structure for growth.  There are ways
for callers to indicate what information they are interested in, as well as
ways for the filesystem to indicate which pieces of valid information have
been returned.

<p>
Howells noted that Dave Chinner wanted more I/O parameters (e.g. preferred
read and write sizes, erase block size).  There were five to seven
different numbers that Chinner wanted, but those could always be added
later, he said.
</p>

<p>
There are also some useful information flags that will be returned.  Those
will indicate if the file is a kernel file (e.g. in <tt>/proc</tt> or
<tt>/sys</tt>), if it is compressed (and thus will result in extra latency when
accessed), if it is encrypted, or if it is a sparse file.  Windows has many
of these indications.
</p>

<p>
But Ted Ts'o complained that there are two different definitions of a
compressed file.  It could mean that the file is not compressible, because
it has already been done, or it could mean that the filesystem has done
something clever and a read will return the real file contents.  It is
important to clearly define what the flag means.  The
<tt>FS_IOC_GETFLAGS</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command did not do so, he said,
so he wanted to ensure that the same mistake is not made with <tt>xstat()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There are other pieces of information that <tt>xstat()</tt> could return,
Howells said.  For example, whether accessing the file will cause an
automount action or getting "foreign user ID" information for filesystems
that don't have Unix-style UIDs or that have UIDs that do not map to the
local system.  There are also the Windows file attributes (archive, hidden,
read-only, and system) that could be returned.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o suggested leaving out anything that did not have a clear definition of
what it meant.  That might help get <tt>xstat()</tt> merged.  Others can be
added later, he said.
</p>

<p>
Howells then described more of the functionality in his current version.
There are three modes of operation.  The standard mode would work the same
way that <tt>stat()</tt> works today; it would force a sync of the file and
retrieve an update from the server (if there is one).  The second would be
a "sync if we need to" mode; if only certain information that is stored
locally is needed, it would simply be returned, but if the information
requested required an update from the server (e.g. atime), that will be
done.  The third, "no sync" mode, means that only local values will be
used; "it might be wrong, but it will be fast".  For local filesystems, all
three modes work the same way.
</p>

<p>
Jeff Layton asked: "How do we get it in without excessive bikeshedding?"
He essentially answered his own question by suggesting that Howells start
small and simply add "a few things that people really want".  Joel Becker
suggested that only parameters with "actual users in some upstream" be
supported. That could help trim the list, he said.
</p>

<p>
Howells said that he asked for comments from various upstreams, but that
only Samba had responded.  Becker reiterated that whatever went in should
be guided by actual users, since it takes work to support adding these bits
of information.  Howells agreed, noting that leaving extra space and having
the masks and flags will leave room for expansion.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, Howells <a href="/Articles/685519/">posted a new patch
set</a> after LSFMM that reintroduces <tt>xstat()</tt> as the <a
href="/Articles/685791/#statx"><tt>statx()</tt> system call</a>.

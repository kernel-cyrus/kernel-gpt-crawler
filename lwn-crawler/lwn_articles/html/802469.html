           </div>
<p><tt>kmalloc()</tt> is a frequently used primitive for the allocation of
small objects in the kernel. During the <a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">2019
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit</a>, Vlastimil
Babka <a href="/Articles/787740/">led a session</a> about the unexpected
alignment problems developers face when using this function. After a few
months he has come back with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190826111627.7505-1-vbabka@suse.cz/">the second
version of a patch set</a> implementing a natural alignment guarantee for
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>. From the strong opposition it faced
initially, it seemed that the change would not get accepted. However, it
ended up in Linus Torvalds's tree. Let's explore what happened.</p>

<p>The issue Babka wanted to fix is the fact that <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
sometimes returns objects that are not naturally aligned (that is, aligned
to the object size if that size is a power of two).  Most of the time,
though, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> does  return
naturally aligned objects and some drivers and subsystems have come to depend
on that property.  The exceptions are when SLUB debugging is enabled or
when the SLOB allocator is used.  <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is essentially a shell
around the 
SLAB, SLUB or SLOB allocator, depending on the kernel configuration;
interested readers may wish to read an article on <a href="/Articles/229984/">the
reasons SLUB was introduced</a> and look at a LinuxCon 2014 <a
href="https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/slides/slaballocators.pdf">slide
set [PDF]</a> on the three allocators.  Unexpectedly returning an
unaligned object can cause data
corruption and other errors. In response to that problem, Babka
proposed to guarantee natural alignment for allocated objects with
power-of-two size, so that all alignment expectations are fulfilled.</p>

<h4>For and against <tt>kmalloc()</tt> alignment</h4>

<p>In the patch set discussion, Christopher Lameter (the creator of the
SLUB allocator) <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/0100016cd98bb2c1-a2af7539-706f-47ba-a68e-5f6a91f2f495-000000@email.amazonses.com/">disagreed</a>
with the idea of adding natural alignment and noted that <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
has its own alignment limit (<tt>KMALLOC_MINALIGN</tt>) for a reason: to
allow optimized memory layout without wasting memory.  The SLOB allocator is an
example; it is designed for small embedded systems and to incur minimal
overhead. The patch from Babka would change that expected behavior. Also,
any future allocators would have to take those new constraints into account
and that would prevent them from implementing certain optimizations in their
memory layout.</p>

<p>Matthew Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190828194607.GB6590@bombadil.infradead.org/">was
in favor of Babka's proposal</a>, as there are many subsystems that
already depend on the implied alignment behavior. He mentioned examples
like the persistent-memory (pmem) and RAM-disk drivers. The XFS filesystem,
without an alignment guarantee, would need slab caches for each object size
between 512 bytes and <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt>, and it may need even more of them
depending on what <tt>kmalloc()</tt> does guarantee.</p>

<p>Dave Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190828222422.GL1119@dread.disaster.area/">agreed</a>
with providing alignment for small objects and spoke for further alignment
of large objects (bigger than a page) to page boundaries. This need was
seen when using pmem with <a href="/Articles/612153/">KASAN</a>. He
suggested, though, using a <tt>GFP</tt> flag to tell the allocator to
return a naturally aligned object, and to fail if it cannot.  That
would avoid the need for higher-level subsystems to create additional
caches. Babka and other developers preferred to deal with the issue without
a separate flag.</p>

<p>A heated debate followed about the severity of the issue.  Lameter <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/0100016cf8c3033d-bbcc9ba3-2d59-4654-a7c2-8ba094f8a7de-000000@email.amazonses.com/">disagreed</a>
that the misalignment cases are frequent, or even seen in practice, as the
drivers affected are enabled in distribution test systems that use debug
options. The cases of bad alignment should have been seen in that testing,
according to him. Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190904051933.GA10218@lst.de/">noted</a> that the
breakage often happens under special conditions, like 
buffers that cross a page boundary.</p>

<h4>From a private NAK to the mainline</h4>

<p>Following the debate, Babka <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/df8d1cf4-ff8f-1ee1-12fb-cfec39131b32@suse.cz/">asked</a> 
for formal approval or disapproval of the patch set:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    So if anyone thinks this is a good idea, please express it (preferably
    in a formal way such as Acked-by), otherwise it seems the patch will be
    dropped (due to a private NACK, apparently).
</div>
</p>

<p>David Sterba <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190923171710.GN2751@twin.jikos.cz/">commented</a>
that he has had to apply workarounds for misalignment cases and would be happy
to remove them when the generic code is fixed. Darrick J. Wong <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190923175146.GT2229799@magnolia/">seconded</a>
Sterba's opinion and expressed his strong preference for open discussion:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    Oh, I didn't realize  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ that *some* of us are allowed the
    privilege of gutting a patch via private NAK without any of that open
    development discussion inconvenience. &lt;grumble&gt;
</div>
</p>

<p>Lameter <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1909242045250.17661@www.lameter.com/">followed
up</a> stating that the options to detect misalignment have been
available for years and are ready to use. Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190924205133.GK1855@bombadil.infradead.org/">disagreed</a>,
as the issues show up when debugging options are enabled and this is
particularly the case when all of the other features should work fine:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    People who are enabling a debugging option to debug their issues,
should not
    have to first debug all the other issues that enabling that debugging
    option uncovers!
</div>
</p>

<p>Andrew Morton moved the discussion back to the technical subject and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190924165425.a79a2dafbaf37828a931df2b@linux-foundation.org/">asked
for verification</a> of the patch's correctness. Lameter <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1909260005060.1508@www.lameter.com/">confirmed</a>
that it is technically fine, while still disagreeing with the intent. That
was followed by a number of acknowledgments (<tt>Acked-by:</tt>) from
kernel developers showing their support for Babka's solution.</p>

<p>That series of approvals ended the public
discussion; Babka did not resend the patch set or submit a third
version. The situation seemed blocked as the patch set had support of
multiple developers, but not from the maintainer of the SLUB allocator,
which is heavily affected by the patch set. However, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eda57a0e42998d1d403187844faa86c9a3ab2fd0">the  
patch was included</a> in  Morton's tree and was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=59bb47985c1db229ccff8c5deebecd54fc77d2a9">merged  
to the mainline</a> on October 7th.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>This discussion shows an example of the kernel community working on a
change that affects a behavior that has been present for a long time. It
is not a surprise that not all developers agreed with the solution &mdash;
however, in this case, the one disagreeing was the maintainer of one of the
modified subsystems. The final result shows that such changes can be
accepted into the mainline since there was wide support from
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> users and other memory-management developers.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm confused. Why can't we have a separate API for callers that have a specific alignment requirement? That would allow any allocator to optimally supply what is expected instead of having to guess the caller's intent.<br>

Because the kernel is full of callers whose intent is to get aligned access, but don't explicitly specify it.  Why do I say their intent is to get aligned access?  Simply because of the fact that access always has been aligned up to now, in all but a few oddball configurations.  If it almost always behaves that way in practice, any support in callers for unaligned access won't get exercised and will inevitably rot away.  By the same argument you can say that malloc() (in user space / libc) is effectively an API that never returns null on failure, since it never does so in practice and nobody writes application code that handles it correctly; even with the best of intentions such code wouldn't get exercised enough for it to have a chance of working correctly.<br>
<p>
I think the question is more whether there are any callers that have a specific requirement for unaligned allocations, that is, cases where there are so many tiny allocations that the wasted space matters.  And if they exist, whether they wouldn't be better served with large requests to kmalloc() feeding to their own internal allocator which portions them out into tiny slices.<br>
<p>
(This from the perspective of a non-kernel-developer, but the same issue arises in any API, having only one real implementation, where a particular behaviour is theoretically possible but doesn't arise in practice.  In my view the answer is almost always to tighten up the specification, codifying the implicit guarantees that have held up to now.)<br>

Typically such unspoken ABIs are extended explicitly, by adding new flags. <br>
<p>
So by default kmalloc() should return an aligned block, but there should be a flag explicitly requesting unaligned block. This way there won't be a need to have multiple allocators in each subsystem needing this.<br>

<p>
The new alignment guarantees are only for power of two sizes, and that's when the common SLAB and SLUB configurations already don't waste any memory. For other sizes, kmalloc() will mostly round them up to the nearest power-of-two anyway (exceptions are 96 and 192 bytes, see your /proc/slabinfo), so the waste comes from that. Those who allocate significant number of "oddly sized" objects should create own cache for them by kmem_cache_create() with precise size and optional alignment, which will minimize the waste. <br>

      <i>The new alignment guarantees are only for power of two sizes...</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The result should be aligned to <tt>min(PAGE_SIZE, n &amp; ~(-1+n))</tt>, which is the place value of the lowest-order '1' bit in the requested size (but limited to the sizeof one page).  So if the request is for 40 bytes then the result should be 8-byte aligned.  The rationale is: the alignment of a <tt>struct</tt> having that size.

The expression was n &amp; ~(-1 + n).  That's a slightly steganographically obscured version of n &amp; ~(n - 1). Assuming that n is some non-zero binary number, subtracting one from that causes the lowest set 1 bit to change to 0 and all 0 bits below it to 1. All other 1 bits of n are also 1 in n - 1. Hence n &amp; ~(n - 1) leaves only the lowest bit of n set. <br>

Randy Dunlap got elected as the leader of a session on kexec and fast
booting.  There are several approaches to speeding the Linux boot process;
they include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Bypassing the firmware, particularly on reboots.  That, of course, is 
     what the kexec patch is for; it allows one kernel to boot directly
     into another without passing through the BIOS first.
<p>
<li> Parallelizing device initialization.  The 2.6 kernel still probes for
     devices in a serial manner; this probing can be slow, but there is
     usually no real reason why probing for and initializing other devices
     cannot be happening at the same time.
<p>
<li> A known devices database which could eliminate much probing
     altogether.  In many cases, the hardware configuration almost never
     changes; the startup process could take advantage of that fact and
     avoid most of the probing it currently does.
<p>
<li> Running initialization scripts in parallel.  In practice, this
     technique helps less than one might expect; what is gained in
     parallelization tends to be lost in disk seeks.
<p>
<li> Early user space (initramfs and such) could be used to trim the
     initialization process to the bare minimum.
</ul>
<p>

Additionally, the consumer electronics people are interested in "execute in
place" (XIP) capability.  On many small devices, the kernel (and
applications too) is located in flash memory which is directly addressable
by the processor.  Rather than copy the kernel from flash to RAM, why not
run it directly from its place in flash, avoid the copy, and preserve RAM
space?  The downside is that flash tends to be slower, so there will be a
performance penalty.  There is talk of trying to copy just the "hotspots"
in the kernel code to RAM; this approach looks like a recipe for complexity
and trouble.
<p>

The kexec patch turns out to have another use, which was revisited in the
next session: it can be set up to preserve part of kernel memory over the
reboot.  If things are carefully done, it can thus be used to implement a
sort of crash dump capability.

      Note that the random seeks on disk can be avoided by a technique used by Windows XP: that OS 'remembers' what sectors of the disk were accessed during boot, and places them close to each other on disk. This is a kind of optimized disk defragmentation. There is a lot of performance to be gained with this technique, I think.<p>Also, this is desperately needed. Booting Linux is slow. Very slow. On a server this is no problem, but it's not acceptable on a desktop which is switched off every night.

      Windows only locates some minimal items to the front of the disk. The rest are still located all over the disk. The save most of their time by delaying most items until a user has logged in. So you get the window up front asap and the apps you need later. They also have an 'integrated' windowing system and kernel. Putting X into the kernel would speed up boot time tons... <p>of course it would lead to a lot of problems.

      It would seem to me that you should be able to get X running before Linux is completely booted for users that want a GUI. Now with the XFree86 fork, perhaps it will be possible to initialize the kernel and X with perhaps the user's GUI of choice. It also seems that it should take advantage of multiple cpus and hyperthreading when available.<p>

      If the kernel didn't block booting while initializing devices, it could start init as soon as the device with the root filesystem was found, and X could start as soon as the video device was detected. It wouldn't actually help to put X in the kernel (aside, I guess, from having it loaded efficiently by the bootloader before other things are using the disk); the real gains would come from not waiting for anything unnecessary. For that matter, it doesn't matter where X is if xdm isn't started until after alsa, exim, inetd, lpd, sshd, atd, and cron.

      It should be possible to do a simple version of this - just remember all the programs that were executed during startup, and put them in a cramfs image which is used as a cachefs/overlaidfs over the original file system during booting.  It should be possible to read the cramfs in a few seconds.<br>

      http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Scripting  <br>  <br>SLEEP COMMANDS   <br>  <br>sleep command   <br>usleep command   <br>  <br>Today's typical developer main PC at home is a P4 or AMD screaming fast  <br>iron. These new programmers actually miss the resource limiting  <br>constraints of a Atari St, Amiga 3000, Commodore 64 or even a 8088 Intel  <br>PC with only 640 kbyte RAM. For sake! Even Bill Gates once said the 640  <br>kb RAM limit would never be exceeded.   <br>  <br>Nowadays, besides RAM abuse, CPU cycles are really abused in god  <br>forbidden ways and methods. For e.g. pcmcia and hotplug to work, its  <br>common practice that inside a startup script the kudzu program is called  <br>several times in a row. Next if one counts inside /etc/rc.d/init.d  <br>directory the number of &quot;sleep 1&quot; calls, one finally understands why that  <br>P4 3.0 GHz hotrod iron is still slower at booting up as my old pentium  <br>P75 with RedHat 4.2 :   <br>  <br>[root@tinker init.d]# grep sleep * | wc -l   <br>31  <br>[root@tinker init.d]#   <br>  <br>So booting might at least take 30 seconds extra due to sleep commands.  <br>One might check /etc/init.d/functions where the sleep command is used  <br>inside a loop! Why not use the usleep command? This command uses a  <br>microsecond as its time unit instead of a whole second. My solution would  <br>be to replace all sleep shell scripting commands with usleep and put 2 or  <br>3 zeros behind the number of seconds . so one would replace :   <br>  <br>sleep 1 ==&gt; usleep 1000   <br>  <br>1 second ===&gt; 1 msec   <br>  <br>Your Linux machine and its scripts might boot/run a 1000 times faster  <br>after this. <br> <br>Robert

      The &quot;known devices list&quot; could be a compile-time option, in which the system is probed for device info, which is saved in the kernel.  Then, when rebooted, the new kernel would already know what was there, and thus be able to avoid probing.<p>Of course, this would not work with hotplug devices, and certainly not when compiling for a different system.  So it would have to be an option.

      Every time a system shuts down, the used devices can be recorded.  With<br>enough reboots, a common list of the system's devices will become known.<p>This list can then be saved on the system's init ram disk so upon further<br>boots, only those devices are initialized.

<h1>Zero-copy TCP receive</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 19, 2018</br>
           </div>
In the performance-conscious world of high-speed networking, anything that
can be done to avoid copying packet data is welcome.  The <a
href="/Articles/726917/"><tt>MSG_ZEROCOPY</tt> feature</a> added in 4.14
enables zero-copy transmission of data, but does not address the receive
side of the equation.  It now appears that the 4.18 kernel will include <a
href="/Articles/752046/">a zero-copy receive mechanism</a> by Eric Dumazet
to close that gap, at least for some relatively specialized applications.
<p>
Packet reception starts in the kernel with the allocation of a series of
buffers to hold packets as they come out of the network interface.  As a
general rule, the kernel has no idea what will show up next from the
interface, so it cannot know in advance who the intended recipient of the
next packet to arrive in a given buffer will be.  An implementation of
zero-copy reception will thus have to map these packet buffers into
user-space memory after the packets come in and are associated with
an open socket.
<p>
That, in turn, implies a set of constraints that must be met.  Mapping of
memory into a process's address space is done on a per-page granularity;
there is no way to map a fraction of a page.  So inbound network data must
be both page-aligned and page-sized when it ends up in the receive buffer,
or it will not be possible to map it into user space.
Alignment can be a bit tricky because
the packets coming out of the interface start with the protocol headers,
not the data the receiving process is interested in.  It is the <i>data</i>
that must be aligned, not the headers.  Achieving this alignment is
possible, but it requires cooperation from the network interface; in
particular, it is necessary to use a network interface that is capable of
splitting the packet headers into a different buffer as the packet comes
in.
<p>
It is also necessary to ensure that the data arrives in chunks that are a
multiple of the system's page size, or partial pages of data will result.
That can be done by setting the maximum transfer unit (MTU) size properly
on the interface.  That, in turn, can require knowledge of exactly what the
incoming packets will look like; in a test
program <a href="/Articles/752197/">posted</a> with the patch set, Dumazet
sets the MTU to 61,512. 
That turns out to be space for fifteen 4096-byte pages of data, plus
40&nbsp;bytes for the IPv6 header and 32&nbsp;bytes for the TCP header.

</blockquote>
<p>
The core of Dumazet's patch set is the implementation of <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
for TCP sockets.  Normally, using <tt>mmap()</tt> on something other than
an ordinary file creates a range of address space that can be used for
purposes like communicating with a device.  When it is called on a TCP
socket, though, the behavior is a bit different.  If the conditions are met
(the next incoming data chunk is page-sized and page-aligned), the
buffer(s) containing that data will be mapped into the calling process's
address space, where it can be accessed directly.  This operation also has
the effect of consuming the incoming data, much as if it had been obtained
with <tt>recvmsg()</tt> instead.  That is, needless to say, an unusual side
effect from an <tt>mmap()</tt> call.
<p>
When the incoming data has been processed, the process should call
<tt>munmap()</tt> to release the pages and free the buffer for another
incoming packet.
<p>
If things are not just right (there is only a partial page of data
available, for example, or that data is not page-aligned), the
<tt>mmap()</tt> call will fail, returning <tt>EINVAL</tt>.  That will also
happen if there is urgent data in the pipeline.  In such cases, the call
does not consume the data, and the application must fall back to
<tt>recvmsg()</tt> to obtain it.
<p>
It has long been conventional wisdom in the kernel community that zero-copy
schemes dependent on memory-mapping tricks will struggle to outperform
implementations that simply copy the data.  There is quite a bit of
overhead involved in setting up and tearing down these mappings.  Indeed,
Dumazet cautioned in the patch introduction that there may not be a benefit
if the application uses a lot of threads, since the contention for the
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> lock will become too expensive.  But it is still natural
to wonder if performing zero-copy packet reception in this way is worth the
trouble. 

<p>
One way of reducing the cost would be to not call <tt>mmap()</tt> until
several pages of data are available to be consumed, so that they can all be
mapped in a single batch.  The network stack
provides a way to request that the application not be notified until a
certain amount of data is pending in the form of the <tt>SO_RCVLOWAT</tt>
option.  That said, the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html"><tt>socket()</tt>
man page</a> cautions:
<P>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The select(2) and poll(2) system calls currently do not respect the
        SO_RCVLOWAT setting on Linux, and mark a socket readable when even
        a single byte of data is available.  A subsequent read from the
        socket will block until SO_RCVLOWAT bytes are available.
</div>
<p>
That shortcoming would make <tt>SO_RCVLOWAT</tt> useless for this
purpose.  That problem appears to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c7004482e8dc">to have been fixed</a> in
2008 for the 2.6.28 kernel, though, so the man page is a bit behind the
times.  Even so, there were still some shortcomings with
<tt>SO_RCVLOWAT</tt>, including spurious wakeups, that Dumazet fixed as a
part of this series.
<p>
In some benchmark results posted with <a href="/Articles/752207/">the core
patch</a>, Dumazet shows some impressive improvements in packet-processing
performance — from 129µs/MB to just 45µs/MB.  Naturally, this is a tuned
test running in a controlled setting, but it shows that there are indeed
benefits to be had.  Those benefits will be generally available before too
long; networking maintainer Dave Miller has <a
href="/Articles/752208/">applied</a> the series for the 4.18 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The underlying memory map would still need to change each time, to avoid copying the underlying pages. That said, using mmap repeatedly for this does seem quite strange.<br>

Right. An ioctl could at least return a proper error code (say, EAGAIN), and there's precedent for an ioctl consuming data. There's no precedent for mmap being destructive!<br>

It might be worth comparing this to how PF_PACKET sockets works with mmap.<br>
<p>
Those I believe implement a shared ring buffer between kernel and user space.  Something like that might be possible.<br>
<p>
TCP is a little different though as you are seeing the abstraction.  With I think tcp segment offload or the ingress equivalent I think it is very likely you will get the kind of packets needed in this case.  <br>
<p>
Doing anything more complicated (aka a ring buffer) I suspect would be quite a bit harder to implement and more fragile than what has been implemented here.  As this sounds like it is just taking packets right out of the existing packet queue.<br>

Another possibility is just mapping the entire packet into the user-mode ring buffer and letting userspace skip over the embedded protocol headers --- sort of as a hybrid between a conventional network stack and a user-space network stack. <br>

Could showing the header data to userspace conceivably introduce a security hole?  It might be better to zero out those bytes (once the kernel has finished with them of course) before handing the page over to userspace.<br>

The FireWire host controller interface is standardized and must support scatter+gather, so the driver can instruct it to write the header words into another buffer so that only the actual data bytes end up in the mmap buffer. This requires that the header size is fixed and 32-bit aligned, so doing the same for a TCP/IP interface would require more flexible hardware support.<br>
<p>
There is also a mode that dumps everything into the buffer, where the application has to parse out the packet metadata and headers.<br>

Would speculative page faults patchset be able to address the contention for the mmap_sem lock?<br>

It is a little odd to see such unusual band controversial change that also introduces new API, to be merged so quickly.<br>

Wouldn't this also have to out perform kernel bypass functionality offered by vendors such as Solar Flare?<br>

Well I’d assume these proposed patches are for a variety of NICs from multiple vendors. The SolarFlare stuff is (I assume) specific to their NICs. <br>

I may be naive, but I feel that hiding headers for any zero copy application is useless and adds compexity. Kernel can instead put a whole packet 'as is' into userspace memory and provide two 'data start/data end' pointers for each packet to help application to ignore headers.<br>

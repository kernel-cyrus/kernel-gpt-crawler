<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 23, 2024</br>
           </div>
<p>
The long-running effort to complete the work on stacking (or composing) the
Linux security modules (LSMs) recently encountered a barrier—in the form of
a "suggestion" to discontinue it from Linus Torvalds.  His complaint
revolved around the indirect function calls that are used to implement
LSMs, but he also did not think much of the effort to switch away from
those calls.  While it does not appear that a major course-change is in store
for LSMs, it is clear that Torvalds is not happy with the direction of that
subsystem. 
</p>

<p>
In an April&nbsp;9 <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHk-=wh+_xXpnHfUv=FwGWcce4XwqwKvtq7LcxK6WKmbf4eGGA@mail.gmail.com/">post</a>
to the linux-security-module mailing list, Torvalds decried the stacking
plans in part because "<q>we just had *another* hardware security issue with
speculated indirect branches go public</q>".  He was referring to the <a
href="/Articles/969210/">branch history injection flaw</a> that was the
most recent in a long line of speculative-hardware vulnerabilities.  Torvalds said that he recognized that stacking
LSMs was a "<q>design decision
and a target</q>" for over a decade, but it needs a rethink:
<blockquote class="bq">
So I say "suggestion" in the subject line, but  really think it needs
to be more than that: this whole "nested LSM" stuff as a design goal
just needs to be all rolled back, and the new design target is "one
LSM, enabled statically at build time, without the need for indirect
calls".
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He also said that he was aware of KP Singh's <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20240207124918.3498756-1-kpsingh%40kernel.org/">work</a>
to use <a href="/Articles/815908/">static calls</a> to avoid the indirect
function calls in LSMs, but seemed to suggest that the patches were "<q>random hacks</q>". 
There are some seeming misunderstandings in Torvalds's complaints, however.
For one 
thing, there is no "nesting" of LSMs—"stacking" either really—the security
solutions are 
composed, instead.  A given hook function in the core kernel will
effectively traverse the list of active LSMs, calling the corresponding
hook function if present for an active LSM, until it gets a denial, which
short-circuits the rest of the calls.  If no LSM denies the access, it is
allowed. 
</p>

<p>
There are a number of real use cases for having multiple LSMs active in
the kernel.  Our <a href="/Articles/912775/">2022 article</a> on the
feature describes the history of how we have gotten to this point and why
it is important to be able to enable multiple LSMs on current systems.  It
has been possible to compose any number of "minor" LSMs for years now, but
the final push is on to allow more than one "major" LSM (e.g. SELinux,
Smack, AppArmor) to be enabled.  The main reason behind the need for that
is containers, so that a Fedora container that uses SELinux can run on 
an Ubuntu host that uses AppArmor, for example.
</p>

<p>
In a response to Torvalds, Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/202404091041.63A1CFC1A@keescook/">patiently
pointed out</a> some of that history, including the reasons behind the
LSM-stacking work.  In the end, he said, it has simplified things to the
point where 
subsystems that logically should be LSMs could be switched:

<blockquote class="bq">
The general "LSM stacking" work, while it does add a certain kind of
complexity, has actually made the many pre-existing manual layering of
LSMs much more sane and simpler to reason about. Now the security hooks
are no longer a random sprinkling of calls tossed over the core kernel,
and are now all singularly well defined. This started years ago with
pulling the "capabilities" checking into a well-defined LSM, and continued
from there for things like Yama, and has now finally reached the last,
and perhaps most historically invasive, LSM: IMA/EVM [<a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/">Integrity Measurement 
Architecture/Extended Verification Module</a>], which is finally
now a well defined LSM too.
<p>
I don't think it's sane to demand that LSM stacking be removed. That's
just not the world we live in -- we have specific and large scale needs
for the infrastructure that is in place.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Cook also disagreed with the characterization of static calls, noting that
they have been needed by the LSM subsystem for over a year just for the
performance benefits.  But Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHk-=whXwcBzFJd65gQ09EGt1yuH6RyuErhOgvJK8pjkAVw07w@mail.gmail.com/">strongly
disagreed</a>; he 
said that the reason for stacking is: "<q>Just because you people cannot
agree</q>".  He also explained that it was not static calls themselves that were random hacks,
but that the use of them for LSMs is, in part because of the random-seeming
limit of 11&nbsp;levels of "nesting".  His parting shot was to further
paint the LSMs as an 
attack vector against the kernel.
</p>

<p>
As might be guessed, Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/202404091430.A00477BC9@keescook/">saw
things differently</a>.  He noted, again, that stacking has been around for
quite some time now; his current system has five separate LSMs activated,
not to mention the capabilities LSM that is always present.  "Stacking" is
not removable at this point, but, beyond that, the most recent
vulnerability  is not in the LSM subsystem: "<q>the attack vector is broken
CPUs</q>". 
In addition, the array to hold the static calls needs to have a limit and
there are 11&nbsp;LSMs available for the kernel, which is why that number
was chosen.
</p>

<p>
LSM maintainer Paul Moore <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhSMWr9OEsHQ6y=3fw+Qk_1mWg2GcCfERHD4vn9Y_XOJsQ@mail.gmail.com/">was
rather unhappy</a> with another part of Torvalds's message.  For whatever
reason, Torvalds was unable to resist taking a shot at the LSM subsystem
and its developers in his initial message:
<blockquote class="bq">
Yes, I realize that the "security" in the LSM name is a bad joke, and
that to a first level approximation the LSM people don't actually care
about real security, and that the goal is just "policy".
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Moore wondered if the insult was really just rooted in stress from
yet another hardware flaw affecting the kernel, but even so, the effects
will be borne by the LSM developers.  Because of who he is, Torvalds's
words have much greater weight, Moore said.  It is thus rather ironic that
Torvalds is asking—"<q>(demanding? it's hard to say at
this point)</q>"—those he just insulted to rework their subsystem.  Moore
pointed out that insults are not likely to be particularly motivating. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, as Cook had pointed out, it is far too late to remove stacking
entirely.  The LSM developers will act on Torvalds's email, Moore said, but
the first 
step is to reduce the performance penalty of the indirect calls—and, in the
process, 
mitigate the hardware security flaws they expose—by
getting the LSM static calls patches merged.  "<q>The rest will
need more discussion, preferably after things have cooled down and we
call all look at things with a more objective lens.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Casey Schaufler, who has been pushing the full LSM-stacking work upstream for 12&nbsp;years or more at this point, <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/37ee8a6c-ecd1-4669-8e60-df6adeb0eab7@schaufler-ca.com/">replied</a>
to Torvalds's complaints by agreeing with some of his points.  As with
other developers, he is completely in favor of replacing the indirect
calls, but is 
unsure what they should be replaced with if static calls are not the right
approach.  "<q>While I can't change the brain dead behavior of 21st century
hardware
I am perfectly willing to re-write the entire $%^&amp;*( LSM layer if it
can be done in a way that makes you happy.</q>"  But Moore <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhQfTRCOCO4hQtvRBd-UdwVKkG-5g=Ng=oo3vTy8C-u6SA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that Schaufler should not head down that path;  Moore has no plans to move to
"<q>a single-LSM approach to satisfy a spur
of the moment comment triggered by the latest hardware flaw</q>".  He
repeated his plan to convert the LSMs to use static calls "<q>and go from
there</q>".   
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Greg Wettstein <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20240411103351.GA11734@wind.enjellic.com/">thought</a>
that more sweeping changes are needed for LSMs in order to support "<q>an
environment where there are going 
to be multiple and potentially industry specific mandated security 
controls</q>".  While he agrees that the performance and attack-vector
characteristics of indirect branches need to be mitigated, he does not see
static calls as the right path, at least given the current LSM
architecture.
<blockquote class="bq">
There needs to be an 'LSM' architecture that allows a security policy
to be implemented for a process hierarchy, just like we do for all
other resource namespaces.  Platform owners are then free to select
whether they want to implement multiple orthogonal security controls
or lock the platform into a single control of their choosing.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
While that may sound like a situation tailor-made for a BPF solution, he
cautioned against that approach, as well, citing the discussion about a <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/20240324223231.6249-1-greg@enjellic.com/">recent
patch</a>.  There have been no replies to his post, however, which may
be an indication that radical changes along those lines are fairly
unlikely. 
</p>

<p>
In truth, Torvalds's post seems to have been made in haste—coupled with serious
unhappiness about the latest hardware flaw.  Backing out all of the
LSM-stacking work seems well-nigh impossible at this point, especially
considering the user-space compatibility guarantees that Torvalds himself
regularly 
enforces. Beyond that, the container use case for multiple major LSMs is
not going away either, so some sort of solution will be needed there.
The LSM development community seems willing to engage on alternate
solutions, but one suspects that what has come out of more than a decade of
effort will eventually be adopted.

As someone who works with LSMs I would not mind if the end game was that the kernel offers a unified security architecture that does not differ widely from one major distribution to another, and that a meaningful upgrade path exists to keep all the current use-cases handled.<br>
<p>
Maybe that is eBPF everywhere, maybe it is one comprehensive neo-LSM that people can agree upon, but the current situation is far from desirable. <br>

Maybe if there's no mention of the word "security" anywhere in that new generation... so it wouldn't trigger the leadership, which doesn't even think there ever was such a thing as "security" bugs. IMHO it's futile.<br>

Security has evolved significantly during the lifetime of Linux. No one saw a need for containers, sandboxes or kernel hardening when LSM was introduced over twenty years ago. Back then we were looking at Bell &amp; LaPadula sensitivity and access control lists. We can't introduce new mechanisms to support new use cases if it means dropping support for old mechanisms needed for old use cases. There isn't now, nor will there ever be, a single "security" solution that will please everyone. Even if everyone did agree, there would still be the need to turn it off in some configurations.<br>

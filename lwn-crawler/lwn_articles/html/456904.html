<h1>No-I/O dirty throttling</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 31, 2011</br>
           </div>
"Writeback" is the process of writing dirty pages back to persistent
storage, allowing those pages to be reclaimed for other uses.  Making
writeback work properly has been one of the more challenging problems faced
by kernel developers in the last few years; systems can bog down completely
(or even lock up) when writeback gets out of control.  Various approaches
to improving the situation have been discussed; one of those is Fengguang
Wu's I/O-less throttling patch set.  These changes have been circulating
for some time; they are seen as having potential - if only others could
actually understand them.  Your editor doesn't understand them either, but
that has never stopped him before.
<p>
One aspect to getting a handle on writeback, clearly, is slowing down
processes that are creating more dirty pages than the system can handle.
In current kernels, that is done through a call to
<tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt>, which sets the offending process to work
writing pages back to disk.  This "direct reclaim" has the effect of
cleaning some pages; it also keeps the process from dirtying more pages
while the writeback is happening.  Unfortunately, direct reclaim also tends
to create terrible I/O patterns, reducing the bandwidth of data going to
disk and making the problem worse than it was before.  Getting rid of
direct reclaim has been on the "to do" list for a while, but it needs to be
replaced by another means for throttling producers of dirty pages.
<p>
That is where Fengguang's <a href="/Articles/456503/">patch set</a> comes
in.  He is attempting to create a control loop capable of determining how
many pages each process should be allowed to dirty at any given time.
Processes exceeding their limit are simply put to sleep for a while to
allow the writeback system to catch up with them.  The concept is simple
enough, but the implementation is less so.  Throttling is easy; performing
throttling in a way that keeps the number of dirty pages within reasonable
bounds and maximizes backing store utilization while not imposing
unreasonable latencies on processes is a bit more difficult.
<p>
If all pages in the system are dirty, the
system is probably dead, so that is a good situation to avoid.  Zero dirty
pages is almost as bad; performance in that situation will be exceedingly
poor.  The virtual memory subsystem thus aims for a spot in the middle
where the ratio of dirty to clean pages is deemed to be optimal; that
"setpoint" varies, but comes down to tunable parameters in the end.
Current code sets a simple threshold, with throttling happening when the
number of dirty pages exceeds that threshold; Fengguang is trying to do
something more subtle.

Since developers have complained that his work is hard to understand,
Fengguang

                          setpoint^                  limit^  dirty pages
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The goal of the system is to keep the number of dirty pages at the
setpoint; if things get out of line, increasing amounts of force will be
applied to bring things back to where they should be.  So the first order
of business is to figure out the current status; that is done in two
steps.  The first is to look at the global situation: how many dirty pages
are there in the system relative to the setpoint and to the hard limit that
we never want to exceed?  Using a cubic polynomial function (see <a
href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/67529">the code</a>
for the grungy details), Fengguang calculates a global "pos_ratio" to
describe how strongly the system needs to adjust the number of dirty
pages.
<p>
This ratio cannot really be calculated, though, without taking the backing
device (BDI) into account.  A process may be dirtying pages stored on a
given BDI, and the system may have a surfeit of dirty pages at the moment,
but the wisdom of throttling that process depends also on how many dirty
pages exist for that BDI.  If a given BDI is swamped with dirty pages, it
may make sense to throttle a dirtying process even if the system as a whole
is doing OK.  On the other hand, a BDI with few dirty pages can clear its
backlog quickly, so it can probably afford to have a few more, even if the
system is somewhat more dirty than one might like.  So the patch set tweaks
the calculated pos_ratio for a specific BDI using a complicated formula
looking at how far that specific BDI is from its own setpoint and its
observed bandwidth.  The end result is a modified pos_ratio describing whether the
system should be dirtying more or fewer pages backed by the given BDI, and
by how much.
<p>
In an ideal world, throttling would match the rate at which pages are being
dirtied to the rate that each device can write those pages back; a process
dirtying pages backed by a fast SSD would be able to dirty more pages more
quickly than
a process writing to pages backed by a cheap thumb drive.  The idea is simple:
if N processes are dirtying pages on a BDI with a given bandwidth, each
process should be throttled to the extent that it dirties 1/N of that
bandwidth.  The problem is that processes do not register with the kernel
and declare that they intend to dirty lots of pages on a given BDI, so the
kernel does not really know the value of&nbsp;N.  That is handled by
carrying a running estimate of N.  An initial per-task bandwidth limit is
established; after a period of time, the kernel looks at the number of
pages actually dirtied for a given BDI and divides it by that bandwidth limit to
come up with the number of active processes.  From that estimate, a new
rate limit can be applied; this calculation is repeated over time.
<p>
That rate limit is fine if the system wants to keep the number of dirty
pages on that BDI at its current level.  If the number of dirty pages (for
the BDI or for the system as a whole) is out of line, though, the per-BDI
rate limit will be tweaked accordingly.  That is done through a simple
multiplication by the pos_ratio calculated above.  So if the number of
dirty pages is low, the applied rate limit will be a bit higher than what
the BDI can handle; if there are too many dirty pages, the per-BDI limit
will be lower.  There is some additional logic to keep the per-BDI limit
from changing too quickly.
<p>
Once all that machinery is in place, fixing up
<tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt> is mostly a matter of deleting the old
direct reclaim code.  If neither the global nor the per-BDI dirty limits have
been exceeded, there is nothing to be done.  Otherwise the code calculates
a pause time based on the current rate limit, the pos_ratio, and number of
pages recently dirtied by the current task and sleeps for that long.  The maximum
sleep time is currently set to 200ms.  A final tweak tries to account for
"think time" to even out the pauses seen by any given process.  The end
result is said to be a system which operates much more smoothly when lots
of pages are being dirtied.
<p>
Fengguang has been working on these patches for some time and would
doubtless like to see them merged.  That may yet happen, but adding core
memory management code is never an easy thing to do, even when others can
easily understand the work.  Introducing regressions in obscure workloads
is just too easy to do.  That suggests that, among other things, a lot of
testing will be required before confidence in these changes will be up to
the required level.  But, with any luck, this work will eventually result
in better-performing systems for us all.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Perhaps I'm understanding the problem here; but isn't a process open(2)'ing a file on the BDI a declaration of intent?

      An open(..., O_RDWR, ...) or open(..., O_WRONLY, ...) is a statement of intent to dirty a number of pages greater than zero. It's not necessarily a statement of intent to dirty <em>lots</em> of pages.

That would result in using the worst-case assumption that every process writes as fast as it can to all its writable fds. Not really a useful assumption when you try to distribute a scarce resource.<br>

That patch sounds nice, but has to be tested a lot to confirm it does what it should in every situation. It especially needs testing on lots of different systems with different storages, from USB sticks to big irons. I like the description of how everything is calculated, seems like the Right Approach.<br>

From an application developer / system administrator perspective, it would be nice if processes that are sleeping due to being throttled would appear in a state other than 'S', which implies voluntary blocking.  Perhaps 'E' for "Enforced Sleep" (even just 'D' state would be good enough, if a new process state would be deemed to be a breaking ABI change).<br>

      The current patches just put the process into a normal interruptible sleep, so it won't appear any different.  Remember, though, that the maximum sleep period is measured in milliseconds, so it's not something you would expect to see all that often in a <tt>ps</tt> display.

      If something has a 20% duty cycle, and you are randomly sampling, you expect to see the something in that special state in about 1 out of 5 samples. It doesn't matter if the average cycle time is 37 milliseconds or 20 microseconds. <p>

If the throttling code, only throttles back 20%, then things are probably running just fine. A nightmare situation, such as running a web browser from 2011 swapping to a thumbdrive designed in 2006, would more likely have the process generating dirty pages for less than 10ms, then being put to sleep for 200ms. This would give the observer less than a 5% chance of witnessing the process while it was "awake".

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>January 16, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> Following on from our two earlier namespaces articles (<a
href="/Articles/531114/">Part 1: namespaces overview</a> and <a
href="/Articles/531381/">Part 2: the namespaces API</a>), we now turn to
look at PID namespaces.  The global resource isolated by PID namespaces is
the process ID number space. This means that processes in different PID
namespaces can have the same process ID.  PID namespaces are used to
implement containers that can be migrated between host systems while
keeping the same process IDs for the processes inside the container.

<p> As with processes on a traditional Linux (or UNIX) system, the process
IDs <i>within</i> a PID namespace are unique, and are assigned sequentially
starting with PID 1. Likewise, as on a traditional Linux system, PID
1&mdash;the <tt>init</tt> process&mdash;is special: it is the first process
created within the namespace, and it performs certain management tasks
within the namespace.  




<h4>First investigations</h4>

<p> A new PID namespace is created by calling <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
with the <tt>CLONE_NEWPID</tt> flag. We'll show a simple example program
that creates a new PID namespace using <tt>clone()</tt> and use that
program to map out a few of the basic concepts of PID namespaces. The
complete source of the program (<tt>pidns_init_sleep.c</tt>) can be found
<a href="/Articles/532741/">here</a>. As with the previous article in this
series, in the interests of brevity, we omit the error-checking code that
is present in the full versions of the example program when discussing
it in the body of the article.

<p>
The main program creates a new PID namespace using 
<tt>clone()</tt>, and displays the PID of the resulting child:

<pre>
    child_pid = clone(childFunc,
                    child_stack + STACK_SIZE,   /* Points to start of
                                                   downwardly growing stack */
                    CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, argv[1]);

    printf("PID returned by clone(): %ld\n", (long) child_pid);
</pre>


<p> The new child process starts execution in <tt>childFunc()</tt>, which
receives the last argument of the <tt>clone()</tt> call (<tt>argv[1]</tt>)
as its argument. The purpose of this argument will become clear later.

<p> The <tt>childFunc()</tt> function displays the process ID and parent
process ID of the child created by <tt>clone()</tt> and concludes by
executing the standard <tt>sleep</tt> program:

<pre>
    printf("childFunc(): PID = %ld\n", (long) getpid());
    printf("ChildFunc(): PPID = %ld\n", (long) getppid()); 
    ...
    execlp("sleep", "sleep", "1000", (char *) NULL); 
</pre>

<p> The main virtue of executing the <tt>sleep</tt> program is that it
provides us with an easy way of distinguishing the child process
from the parent in process listings.

<p> When we run this program, the first lines of output are as follows:

<pre>
    $ <b>su</b>         # Need privilege to create a PID namespace
    Password: 
    # <b>./pidns_init_sleep /proc2</b>
    PID returned by clone(): 27656
    childFunc(): PID  = 1
    childFunc(): PPID = 0
    Mounting procfs at /proc2
</pre>

<p> The first two lines line of output from <tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt> show
the PID of the child process from the perspective of two different PID
namespaces: the namespace of the caller of <tt>clone()</tt> and the
namespace in which the child resides. In other words, the child process has
two PIDs: 27656 in the parent namespace, and 1 in the new PID namespace
created by the <tt>clone()</tt> call.

<a name="getppid_0"></a>

<p> The next line of output shows the parent process ID of the child,
within the context of the PID namespace in which the child resides (i.e.,
the value returned by <tt>getppid()</tt>). The parent PID is 0,
demonstrating a small quirk in the operation of PID namespaces. As we
detail below, PID namespaces form a hierarchy: a
process can "see" only those processes contained in its own PID namespace
and in the child namespaces nested below that PID namespace.  Because the
parent of the child created by <tt>clone()</tt> is in a different
namespace, the child cannot "see" the parent; therefore, <tt>getppid()</tt>
reports the parent PID as being zero.

<p> For an explanation of the last line of output from
<tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt>, we need to return to a piece of code that we
skipped when discussing the implementation of the <tt>childFunc()</tt>
function.


<a name="proc_pid"></a>
<h4><tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> and PID namespaces</h4>


<p>
Each process on a Linux system has a <tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> directory
that contains pseudo-files describing the process. This scheme translates
directly into the PID namespaces model. Within a PID namespace, the
<tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> directories show information only about processes
within that PID namespace or one of its descendant namespaces.

<p> However, in order to make the <tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> directories
that correspond to a PID namespace visible, the proc filesystem ("procfs"
for short) needs to be mounted from within that PID namespace. From a shell
running inside the PID namespace (perhaps invoked via the <tt>system()</tt>
library function), we can do this using a <tt>mount</tt> command of the
following form:

<pre>
    # <b>mount -t proc proc /mount_point</b>
</pre>

<p> Alternatively, a procfs can be mounted using the <tt>mount()</tt>
system call, as is done inside our program's <tt>childFunc()</tt> function:

<pre>
    mkdir(mount_point, 0555);       /* Create directory for mount point */
    mount("proc", mount_point, "proc", 0, NULL);
    printf("Mounting procfs at %s\n", mount_point);
</pre>

<p> The <tt>mount_point</tt> variable is initialized from the string
supplied as the command-line argument when invoking
<tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt>.

<p> In our example shell session running <tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt> above,
we mounted the new procfs at <tt>/proc2</tt>. In real world usage, the
procfs would (if it is required) usually be mounted at the usual location,
<tt>/proc</tt>, using either of the techniques that we describe in a
moment. However, mounting the procfs at <tt>/proc2</tt> during our
demonstration provides an easy way to avoid creating problems for the rest
of the processes on the system: since those processes are in the same
<i>mount</i> namespace as our test program, changing the filesystem mounted
at <tt>/proc</tt> would confuse the rest of the system by making the
<tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> directories for the root PID namespace
invisible.

<p> Thus, in our shell session the procfs mounted at <tt>/proc</tt> will
show the <i>PID</i> subdirectories for the processes visible from the
parent PID namespace, while the procfs mounted at <tt>/proc2</tt> will show
the <i>PID</i> subdirectories for processes that reside in the child PID
namespace. In passing, it's worth mentioning that although the processes in
the child PID namespace will be able to see the <i>PID</i> directories
exposed by the <tt>/proc</tt> mount point, those PIDs will not be
meaningful for the processes in the child PID namespace, since system calls
made by those processes interpret PIDs in the context of the PID namespace
in which they reside.

<p> Having a procfs mounted at the traditional <tt>/proc</tt> mount point
is necessary if we want various tools such as <tt>ps</tt> to work correctly
inside the child PID namespace, because those tools rely on information
found at <tt>/proc</tt>.  There are two ways to achieve this without
affecting the <tt>/proc</tt> mount point used by parent PID namespace.
First, if the child process is created using the 
<tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt> flag, then the child will be in a different mount namespace
from the rest of the system. In this case, mounting the new procfs at
<tt>/proc</tt> would not cause any problems. Alternatively, instead of
employing the <tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt> flag, the child could
change its root directory with <tt>chroot()</tt> and mount a procfs at
<tt>/proc</tt>.

<p> Let's return to the shell session running <tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt>. We
stop the program and use <tt>ps</tt> to examine some details of the parent
and child processes within the context of the parent namespace:

<pre>
    ^Z                          <i>Stop the program, placing in background</i>
    [1]+  Stopped                 ./pidns_init_sleep /proc2
    # <b>ps -C sleep -C pidns_init_sleep -o "pid ppid stat cmd"</b>
      PID  PPID STAT CMD
    27655 27090 T    ./pidns_init_sleep /proc2
    27656 27655 S    sleep 600
</pre>

<p> The "PPID" value (27655) in the last line of output above shows that
the parent of the process executing <tt>sleep</tt> is the process executing
<tt>pidns_init_sleep</tt>.

<p> By using the <tt>readlink</tt> command to display the (differing)
contents of the <tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i><tt>/ns/pid</tt> symbolic links
(<a href="/Articles/531381/#proc_pid_ns">explained</a> in last week's
article), we can see that the two processes are in separate PID namespaces:

<pre>
    # <b>readlink /proc/27655/ns/pid</b>
    pid:[4026531836]
    # <b>readlink /proc/27656/ns/pid</b>
    pid:[4026532412]
</pre>

<p> At this point, we can also use our newly mounted procfs to obtain
information about processes in the new PID namespace, from the perspective
of that namespace. To begin with, we can obtain a list of PIDs in the
namespace using the following command:

<pre>
    # <b>ls -d /proc2/[1-9]*</b>
    /proc2/1
</pre>

<p> As can be seen, the PID namespace contains just one process, whose PID
(inside the namespace) is 1. We can also use the
<tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i><tt>/status</tt> file as a different method of
obtaining some of the same information about that process that we already
saw earlier in the shell session:

<pre>
    # <b>cat /proc2/1/status | egrep '^(Name|PP*id)'</b>
    Name:   sleep
    Pid:    1
    PPid:   0
</pre>

<p> The <tt>PPid</tt> field in the file is 0, matching the fact that
<tt>getppid()</tt> reports that the parent process ID for the child is 0.



<h4>Nested PID namespaces</h4>

<p> As noted earlier, PID namespaces are hierarchically nested in
parent-child relationships. Within a PID namespace, it is possible to see
all other processes in the same namespace, as well as all processes that
are members of descendant namespaces. Here, "see" means being able to make
system calls that operate on specific PIDs (e.g., using <tt>kill()</tt> to
send a signal to process).  Processes in a child PID namespace cannot see
processes that exist (only) in the parent PID namespace (or further removed
ancestor namespaces).

<p>
A process will have one PID in each of the layers of the PID namespace
hierarchy starting from the PID namespace in which it resides through to
the root PID namespace. Calls to <tt>getpid()</tt> always report the PID
associated with the namespace in which the process resides.

<p> We can use the program shown <a href="/Articles/532745/">here</a>
(<tt>multi_pidns.c</tt>) to show that a process has different PIDs in each
of the namespaces in which it is visible. In the interests of brevity, we
will simply explain what the program does, rather than walking though its
code.

<p> The program recursively creates a series of child process in nested PID
namespaces.  The command-line argument specified when invoking the program
determines how many children and PID namespaces to create:

<pre>
    # <b>./multi_pidns 5</b>
</pre>

<p> In addition to creating a new child process, each recursive step mounts
a procfs filesystem at a uniquely named mount point. At the end of the
recursion, the last child executes the <tt>sleep</tt> program. The
above command line yields the following output:

<pre>
    Mounting procfs at /proc4
    Mounting procfs at /proc3
    Mounting procfs at /proc2
    Mounting procfs at /proc1
    Mounting procfs at /proc0
    Final child sleeping
</pre>

<p>
Looking at the PIDs in each procfs, we see that each successive procfs
"level" contains fewer PIDs, reflecting the fact that each PID namespace
shows only the processes that are members of that PID namespace or its
descendant namespaces:

<pre>
    ^Z                           <i>Stop the program, placing in background</i>
    [1]+  Stopped            ./multi_pidns 5
    # <b>ls -d /proc4/[1-9]*</b>        <i>Topmost PID namespace created by program</i>
    /proc4/1  /proc4/2  /proc4/3  /proc4/4  /proc4/5
    # <b>ls -d /proc3/[1-9]*</b>
    /proc3/1  /proc3/2  /proc3/3  /proc3/4
    # <b>ls -d /proc2/[1-9]*</b>
    /proc2/1  /proc2/2  /proc2/3
    # <b>ls -d /proc1/[1-9]*</b>
    /proc1/1  /proc1/2
    # <b>ls -d /proc0/[1-9]*</b>        <i>Bottommost PID namespace</i>
    /proc0/1
</pre>

<p> A suitable <tt>grep</tt> command allows us to see the PID of the
process at the tail end of the recursion (i.e., the process executing
<tt>sleep</tt> in the most deeply nested namespace) in all of the
namespaces where it is visible:

<pre>
    # <b>grep -H 'Name:.*sleep' /proc?/[1-9]*/status</b>
    /proc0/1/status:Name:       sleep
    /proc1/2/status:Name:       sleep
    /proc2/3/status:Name:       sleep
    /proc3/4/status:Name:       sleep
    /proc4/5/status:Name:       sleep
</pre>

<p> In other words, in the most deeply nested PID namespace
(<tt>/proc0</tt>), the process executing <tt>sleep</tt> has the PID 1, and
in the topmost PID namespace created (<tt>/proc4</tt>), that process has
the PID 5.

<p> If you run the test programs shown in this article, it's worth
mentioning that they will leave behind mount points and mount
directories. After terminating the programs, shell commands such as the
following should suffice to clean things up:

<pre>
    # <b>umount /proc?</b>
    # <b>rmdir /proc?</b>
</pre>


<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>

PID namespaces. In the next article, we'll fill out the description with a

It depends on what you are doing.   Unix domain sockets translate transmitted pids.<br>
Readlink on /proc/self reports your pid in the pid namespace of the proc mount.<br>
<p>
That should cover most day to day cases.<br>
<p>
Processes in pid namespaces can not escape so process nesting mirrors pid namespace nesting.<br>

With the pid namespace file descriptors you can find can with care mount proc for each of the pid namespaces.<br>
<p>
For a process with children you will need to look at something like start time to distinguish between them.  A little tricky but it should be doable.  Process with parents outside the pid namespace will report their parent pid as 0, so should be easy to find.  Normally there will be only one.<br>

Work toward the signing of BPF programs has
been finding its way into recent mainline kernel releases; it is intended
to improve security by limiting the BPF programs that can be successfully
loaded into the kernel.  As John Fastabend described in his <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/contributions/947/">"Watching
the super powers" session</a> at the <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">2021 Linux Plumbers Conference</a>,
this new feature has the potential to completely break his tools.  But
rather than just complain, he decided to investigate solutions; the result
is an outline for an auditing mechanism that brings greater flexibility to
the problem of controlling which programs can be run.
<p>
The kernel has had the ability to enforce signatures on loadable modules
for years, so it makes sense to consider creating the same mechanism for
BPF programs.  But, while kernel modules and BPF programs look similar —
both are code loaded into the kernel from user space, after all — there are
some significant differences between them.  The safety of kernel modules is
entirely dependent on the diligence of developers.  They are built and
distributed via the usual channels, are tied to specific kernel versions,
and can last for years; they present a stable API to user space.  BPF
programs, instead, benefit from safety built into (and enforced by) the
loader.  They are 
often dynamically built and optimized, they are patched at run time to
avoid being tied to kernel versions, and they have a different lifetime;
often, they are created on the fly and quickly thrown away.  These
differences suggest that the same signing mechanism might not work equally
well for both types of program.
<p>
Fastabend covered the BPF signing scheme; curious readers can find a more
complete description in <a href="/Articles/853489/">this article</a>.  In
short: BPF program 
loading is a complicated, multi-step process involving numerous system
calls; the signature is meant to cover this entire process.

<a href="/Articles/870272/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2021/lpc/JohnFastabend-sm.png" alt="[John Fastabend]"
title="John Fastabend" class="rthumb"></a>

That is done by loading yet another BPF program to handle the process; this
mechanism is mostly implemented, but there are some details left to be
worked out.
<p>
There are certainly advantages to this mechanism, he said.  If Alice and
Bob have signed BPF programs, they can use them as usual.  If Eve comes
along with an unsigned program meant to eavesdrop on the kernel, that
program will not be loaded and Eve will be frustrated.  But there is also a
cost: if Alice is 
generating programs on the fly, those programs will not be signed and will
no longer be loadable.  The keys used to sign programs should not be
present on the system, so signing cannot be done on the fly and Alice's
workflow will be blocked.  Alice, too, will be frustrated despite being a
legitimate user.
<p>
This is not just a hypothetical case; a lot of tooling works that way now.
Perhaps the best-known example is <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>, but it's not the
only one.  The <a href="https://opennetworking.org/p4/">P4</a> system
defines a domain-specific language for the management of networking data
paths.  Some of Fastabend's work on <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a>
is aimed at run-time 
optimization of BPF programs.  <a
href="https://doc.omnetpp.org/inet/api-current/neddoc/inet.common.packet.recorder.PcapRecorder.html">PcapRecorder</a>
is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Data_Path">XDP</a>-based clone
of the venerable <a 
href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> utility.  And so on.  None of
these tools can work in an environment where BPF programs must be signed.
<p>
A lot of the security goals can be achieved, he said, by just making use of
the <a 
href="/Articles/790185/">fs-verity</a> mechanism supported by Linux now.
With fs-verity, read-only files can be signed and the kernel will check the
signature on each access.  If the file has been corrupted somehow, the
signature will not match and access to the file will be blocked.  So one
thing that can be done is to use fs-verity to sign the program that loads
BPF programs into the kernel.  The system will automatically ensure that
this program is not tampered with, and the set of keys that can create
valid signatures can be restricted.
<p>
But it is possible to go further than that, Fastabend said.  Using some
sort of policy engine, which could be another BPF program or a Linux
security module, the kernel can look at the key that was used to sign any
given program and associate a set of privileges with it.  At its most
basic, there could be a single "can load BPF programs" privilege, which
would be similar in effect to attaching the <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability to
the program.  The system could be more fine-grained than that, even, by
controlling actions like access to maps.  With this sort of mechanism, he
said, signature checking on the BPF objects themselves will be unnecessary.
<p>
Consider the case where Alice's BPF-using process is somehow corrupted at
run time.  Signing of BPF programs will not save the system in this case;
the corrupted user-space code can still do things like change values in BPF
maps, change the attachment points for programs, and more.  In other words,
signing a BPF program gives little assurance that said program will run
correctly in a hostile environment.  A more flexible policy mechanism might
do better, though, and could block attempts by a program to exceed its
boundaries.  Perhaps unsigned programs could be allowed to load, but they
would not have the ability to write to user space or access kernel memory,
for example.  Access to pinned maps could be denied as well.
<p>
This mechanism is not yet implemented, but he has some ideas about how it
could be done.  The LLVM compiler can attach attributes to objects; it
could be taught to record all of the helper functions that a program calls,
all of its map operations, and so on.  The BPF verifier would then confirm
that the program stays within those limits, and the supervisor mechanism
could allow or deny a specific program based on the attributes.  All that's
left is to figure out how all this would actually work.
<p>
Fastabend concluded by reiterating his goal of ensuring that dynamically
generated BPF 
programs keep working.  Program signing seems like the wrong solution; it
is only useful in cases where the signed programs won't change.  With an
appropriate set of policy rules, it should be possible to safely allow a
system to run unsigned BPF programs.  In the brief discussion period that
followed, Alexei Starovoitov (the author of the existing signing work)
noted with enthusiasm that there are many other types of permissions that
could be added.  The maximum number of instructions allowed in a program
would be one example.  So there appears to be interest in this idea, but
the real proof, as always, is in the code.

Signing program which direct loaded into kernel space maybe a good way to protect the kernel integrity, there will always has some vuls existed within kernel&#x27;s code, even for BPF which running within a VM like sandbox and has limited functionalities. <br>
<p>
Is that possible to try to just use userspace daemon process which can verify the signing of BPF and constaints within kernel space to only allow certificated userspace daemon process to loading the BPF from userspace, then it can limit the changes from kernel space&#x27;s BPF infra at the same time not break the things which already works, and at the same time it can support both signed and unsigned BPF at same time.<br>
<p>
Actually if can achieve to constaint daemon process&#x27;s capabilities in userspace within kernel, it may also works no only for BPF loading usage, but as some common way which can sandboxing process in userspace in Linux kernel.<br>

One concern I&#x27;m having is that over the last few years, for many improvements proposed in the network stack we got the response &quot;do it in BPF instead&quot;. BPF has been the de-facto standard response to proposals to improve/fix syscalls. It&#x27;s already extremely complicated to use to do simple things. Now if it becomes required to go through even more painful processes like signing etc, it will quickly look like the french administration where you need to fill a form to get the new form that you have to fill to get to the new one ... without seeing any useful work being done during all this time.<br>
<p>
We need to be extremely careful to keep the kernel *usable*. It&#x27;s nice to preventively protect against imaginary threats but that has never prevented them from occurring and it must not come at the expense of usability. I&#x27;m not saying this lightly, especially at an era where the amount of people who still go through the process of configuring and compiling their kernels is now probably limited to mostly developers, and where others just have to live with the options chosen by their distros. When you&#x27;re a userland developer, you don&#x27;t often have the luxury to choose your end-users&#x27; kernel config options.<br>

How does fs-verity help if the BPF loading logic comes from a library used by the program? Is it just the executable which is verified before BPF is allowed or are all loaded libraries verified before BPF is allowed to be used?<br>

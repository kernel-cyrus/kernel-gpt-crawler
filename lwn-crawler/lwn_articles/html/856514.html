<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 21, 2021</br>
           </div>
Among the many changes merged for the 5.13 kernel is support for <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html">the LLVM
control-flow integrity (CFI) mechanism</a>.  CFI defends against exploits by
ensuring that indirect function calls have not been redirected by an
attacker.  Quite a bit of work was needed to make this feature work well
for the kernel, but the result appears to be production-ready and able to
defend Linux systems from a range of attacks.
<p>
<h4>Protecting indirect function calls</h4>
<p>
The kernel depends heavily on indirect function calls — calls where the
destination address is not known at compile time.  Device drivers,
filesystems, and other kernel subsystems interface with the generic, core
code by providing functions to be called to carry out specific actions.
When the time comes to, for example, open a file (which may be a special
file corresponding to a device), the core kernel will make an indirect call
to the appropriate <tt>open()</tt> function defined in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc2/source/include/linux/fs.h#L2022"><tt>file_operations</tt>
structure</a> for the file in question.  Indirect function calls allow for
a clean separation between generic and low-level code.
<p>
This mechanism is flexible and performs well, but it also makes those
indirect calls into an attractive target for attackers.  If an indirect call
can be redirected to an attacker-chosen location, there are few limits to
the disorder that can result.  Changes over the years have made it hard for
attackers to inject their own code into the kernel, but if they can force
execution to an arbitrary location, that matters little.  Note that an
exploit need not redirect a call to the beginning of another function; it
can jump to any 
arbitrary point within the kernel image.  There is no shortage of useful
targets for a corrupted indirect function call.
<p>
CFI attempts to block this sort of exploit by restricting indirect calls to
locations that are plausible targets.  In this case, "plausible" means that
the call goes to the beginning of an actual function, and that the target
function has the same prototype as the caller was expecting.  That is not
a perfect test; there may be functions with the same prototype that will
perform some sort of useful action for an attacker.  But the result is
still a massive reduction in the set of available targets, which will often
be enough.
<p>
This check is often called "forward-edge CFI", since it protects calls to
functions.  The corresponding "backward-edge" protection ensures that
return addresses on the stack have not been tampered with.  The patches
merged for 5.13 are focused on the forward-edge problem.
<p>
<h4>LLVM CFI in Linux</h4>
<p>
Specifically, this CFI implementation works by examining the full kernel
image at link time; for this reason, link-time optimization must also be
enabled to use it.  Whenever a location is found where the address of a
function is taken, LLVM makes a note of the function and its prototype.  It
then injects a set of "jump tables" into the built kernel, one for each
encountered function 
prototype.  So, for example, the <tt>open()</tt> function mentioned above
is defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*open) (struct inode *inode, struct file *file);
</pre>
<p>
There are many functions in the kernel matching this prototype that have
their address taken to stuff into a <tt>file_operations</tt> structure
somewhere.  LLVM will collect them all into a single jump table, which is
essentially a list of the addresses of these functions.
<p>
The next step is to change all of the places where that function's address
is taken, and replace the address with the corresponding location in the
jump table.  So an assignment like:
<p>
<pre>
    func_ptr = my_open_function;
</pre>
<p>
will result in assigning an address within the jump table to
<tt>func_ptr</tt>.
<p>
Finally, whenever an indirect function call is made, control goes to a
special function called <tt>__cfi_check()</tt>; this function receives,
along with the target address, the address of the jump table matching the
prototype of the called function.  It will
verify that the target address is, indeed, an address within the expected
jump table, extract the real function address from the table, and jump to
that address. 
If the target address is not within the jump table, instead, the default
action is to assume that an attack is in progress and immediately panic the
system.  There is a permissive mode selectable at configuration time that
simply logs the error instead.
<p>
<h4>Kernel-specific quirks</h4>
<p>
That severe response may be justified, but it would be awfully annoying if
there were situations where the kernel makes an indirect call to a function
that doesn't exactly match the prototype of the pointer being used.  So,
naturally, the kernel did exactly that.  In pre-5.13 kernels, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.4/source/lib/list_sort.c#L104"><tt>list_sort()</tt></a>
was declared as:
<p>
<pre>
    void list_sort(void *priv, struct list_head *head,
		   int (*cmp)(void *priv, struct list_head *a, struct list_head *b))
</pre>
<p>
The comparison function <tt>cmp()</tt> is passed in by the caller and is
invoked, via an indirect call, to compare items in the list.  Inside
<tt>list_sort()</tt>, though, one sees this line:
<p>
<pre>
    a = merge(priv, (cmp_func)cmp, b, a);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>cmp_func()</tt> type to which the function pointer is cast looks
<i>almost</i> like the prototype of 
<tt>cmp()</tt>, except that the two <tt>list_head</tt> pointers have the
<tt>const</tt> attribute.  That is enough to change the prototype of the
function and, at run time, to cause a CFI failure.  The <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4f0f586bf0c8">fix</a> that was adopted
was to propagate the <tt>const</tt> attribute to the callers of
<tt>list_sort()</tt> so that the cast of the function pointer became
unnecessary.  That, however, required changing callers in 40 different
files across the kernel source.
<p>
Another interesting quirk comes from the fact that the jump tables are
built at link time.  That works for the monolithic kernel, but loadable
modules are linked separately.  CFI in loadable modules works, but each
module gets its own jump tables.  Remember that function pointers are
replaced by pointers into the jump tables; since modules have different
jump tables, they will get different pointers as well.  In other words, the
values of two pointers to the same function will differ if one of them is
in a loadable module.
<p>
For the most part, things will work anyway; calls to those two different
pointers will end up in the same place.  But consider this line in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.4/source/kernel/workqueue.c#L1626"><tt>__queue_delayed_work()</tt></a>:
<p>
<pre>
    WARN_ON_ONCE(timer-&gt;function != delayed_work_timer_fn);
</pre>
<p>
This test was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d8e794dfd51">added to
the 3.7 kernel</a> in 2012 as a way to "<q>detect delayed_work users
which diddle with the internal timer</q>"; nearly nine years later one
assumes that they have all been found, but the test remains.  But, if CFI
is in use, then the address for <tt>delayed_work_timer_fn()</tt> as seen
from a loadable module will not be the same as the address seen from the
core kernel; that will cause the test to fail.  There are a couple of
places in the kernel with tests like this; they have been "fixed" by simply
disabling the test when CFI is configured in.
<p>
Various other things needed to be fixed as well, including making
provisions for parts of the code that absolutely must have a direct pointer
to a function rather than to the jump table.  CFI in the kernel only works
for the arm64 architecture in 5.13; support for x86 is in the works but is
not yet ready to be enabled.  There doesn't seem to be much in the way of
data regarding the performance impact of this feature, but the <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html#performance">LLVM
page describing CFI</a> says that its cost is "<q>less
than&nbsp;1%</q>". 
<p>
CFI looks like a new feature that could have some scary, sharp edges.  It
is worth noting though that Kees Cook, when he sent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202104261141.5B699FE%40keescook/">the pull
request</a> asking that the patches (which were written by Sami Tolvanen)
be merged, said that CFI "<q>has happily lived in Android kernels for
almost 3 years</q>".  It is, in other words, already widely deployed in
the real world and probably doesn't have many surprises left to offer —
except, perhaps, for attackers, who will find that many of their exploits
no longer work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Given that all targets of each indirect call are known, instead of a checked use of an indirect jump table, the indirect call could be replaced by a hard-coded binary search among the possible targets, and finally a direct call.  The comparisons and conditional branches of this search cost something, but given that a retpoline costs a guaranteed misprediction (~20 cycles), in our Spectre-workaround world the binary search is probably cheaper in many cases.

I can&#x27;t imagine a binary search working well, but it&#x27;s not hard to believe a few hot cases checked linearly could work out. A mispredicted call is pretty expensive.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m pretty sure that several compilers use profile guided &quot;optimistic&quot; devirtualization, which basically ends up with code like<br>
if (call_target == very_common_target) very_common_target() else if (call_target == also_common_target) also_common_target() else *call_target(). And I&#x27;ve seen code like that manually written in plenty places, with good success.<br>

      It's a good question, so I wrote <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/function-dispatch/">a microbenchmark</a> to answer it to some extent (and wrote a little discussion of the whole topic).  Unfortunately, especially wrt branch prediction, but also wrt cache misses, actual behaviour depends very much on actual usage, which is hard to model in a microbenchmark.  So the performance numbers I give are from the best case (everything in cache, and perfect branch prediction).  I also give some (theoretical) analysis of the cache-miss cases.

<p>Anyway, with a plain indirect call (through a register) each iteration of the microbenchmark costs 5-6 cycles on a variety of CPUs I measured (from Sandy Bridge to Zen3), and a table-using checked indirect call costs 7-9 cycles; that's both without retpolines.  The binary-search variant (for 7 target functions) costs 6-12 cycles.  If you turn on retpolines, the plain indirect call costs 24-57 cycles, the table-using variant 26-60, and the binary-search variant still costs 6-12 cycles (there are no indirect branches, so no retpolines).  Binary-search cost will grow with the number of targets, but you can have many targets before you reach 26-60 cycles, at least with perfectly predictable branches.

<p>Concerning cache misses, the binary search for 7 targets fits in one I-cache line and incurs fewer cache misses (when it's not in the cache) than the table-using code (which incurs two cache misses in this case). You can probably cover ~42 targets with a maximum of two cache misses: first select among 6 ranges in one cache line, then among 7 in the final cache line.  If you have more targets, you can have more cache misses than the table-using version.  But of course, the question is if you spend more time on the cache misses for cold code, or more time in the retpolines in hot code.

      The number of files that a struct is used in does not tell us anything about the number of targets that clang might see as potential targets for a given call through a function pointer.  With several dozen file system types, I expect that VFS operations will have several dozen target functions (and hopefully with unique signatures).

<p>As for scaling, the basic scaling properties of divide-and-conquer searches are well known.  The search time (and the number of nodes accessed) increases logarithmically with the size of the search space.  If your question is about the constant factors, I can give better answers today than yesterday:

<p>If we try to minimize the number of cache lines accessed (important for cold code), we get a B-tree-like characteristic, where we consider each cache line to be a tree node with 8 subtrees or (for leaf nodes) 8 target functions; in some cases, a little more is possible, giving us 73 targets for a two-level tree.  Measuring such a tree access, I see that this dispatch costs, e.g. on Zen3, 8-10 cycles rather than 6-8 for the binary tree with 7 targets, so every level costs roughly 2 cycles.  So if we have a four-level tree for 4096 targets, the total cost will be about 12-14 cycles (in the well-predicted and cached case) and the search will access 4 I-cache lines.  If there are branch mispredictions, that would cause a lot of slowdown, however.

What about inlining the function performing the indirect call, instatiating the function pointer ?<br>
When applicable, this would remove the indirect call and the performance penalty associated.<br>

      <p>I'm not clear how an attacker is supposed to redirect a call to some other address than the function it was meant to reach.  The <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrityDesign.html">example</a> shows the check carried out in the code near the location of the call itself.  It does nothing to prevent, say, returning from an overflowed stack, does it?
<p>CFI is meant to defend against an attacker who is able to fiddle with jump tables in kernel memory, but neither with the bit arrays nor with the code itself (still in kernel memory), right?  Or maybe it merely tries to impede the attacker by requiring coordinated changes in the jump table and in the bit array?
<p>And how about compiling with GCC?

      As noted in the article, this change provides forward-edge protection.  Protecting against return-address corruption (backward-edge) requires different techniques like shadow stacks.
<p>
The jump tables will be in read-only memory, which makes them a lot harder to overwrite.

      <p>Take an object like</p>

<pre>
struct foo {
  char buf[64];

  int (*fptr)(int);

  struct {
    int (*fptr)(int);
  } *vtable;
};
</pre>

<p>
If an attacker can overflow (struct foo).buf, then they can rewrite the address of fptr or vtable to point wherever. The latter takes extra leg work to exploit, unless they know the address of the (struct foo) object, in which case they can just point vtable back into an area they already wrote, reducing it to the former case.  There are more complex cases (e.g. involving integer indices into tables rather than raw pointers)  but the basic problem is the same: deriving a function pointer through loads from writeable memory regions.

I have a quite hard time believing that, tbh. Not in the sense that I don&#x27;t believe that there are no workload in which that is true (probably lots), but that it&#x27;s true in all &quot;common&quot; workloads. The dcache footprint alone makes me doubt this. It&#x27;s not helped by the subsequent sentence in the LLVM page:<br>
<p>
&quot;Note that this scheme has not yet been optimized for binary size; an increase of up to 15% has been observed for Chromium.&quot;<br>
<p>
There&#x27;s *lots* of code that is primarily bound by icache misses. A 15% increase is pretty substantial.<br>
<p>
I assume that the code size increase in the kernel would be lower than for chromium, which probably has a lot more vtables than linux has &quot;callback structs&quot; like file_operations.<br>

Christoph Lameter works in a different computing environment than most of
us; he supports high-volume trading applications that need every bit of
performance that the fastest hardware can give them.  Even then, it seems
that isn't fast enough.  In a memory-management-track session at the 2018
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Lameter described
some of the problems he has encountered and approaches he is considering to
address them.
<p>
He is working with a large system that has four 10Gb/s network interfaces on
it.  Those interfaces run at full speed during bursts of activity, pouring
data into the page cache, which sits in 1TB of main memory.  That data is
then archived onto a 100TB storage array.  This system is vital for his
company's operations; it must be possible to answer questions from
regulators on exactly when any given packet arrived.  It is important, he
said, that the system works.
<p>
Unfortunately, he is having problems writing data to the archive; the
maximum data rates from the page cache are 4-5GB/s.  The only way the
system can keep up is to remove some of the network interfaces.  A much
higher data rate (around 10GB/s) could be obtained by using direct I/O and
avoiding the page cache altogether, but he would rather not do that.  There
are also a number of analysis processes running on this system, and they
benefit from having the data in the page cache.  So he's not sure what to
do.
<p>
The problem is going to get worse; the company is upgrading to 100Gb/s
interfaces and wants to achieve rates of 40GB/s to the disk.
Lameter thinks that these performance issues are specific to Intel
hardware; everything

works as desired on POWER8 processors.  The root of the problem is the 4KB
system page size, which is quite small on such a system.  Unfortunately,
filesystems and block devices in Linux do not understand huge pages.
<p>
He is considering trying to increase the base page size above 4KB.  This is
not a new idea; developers have been trying to make this work for years.
Hugh Dickins noted that William Lee Irwin's <a href="/Articles/23785/">page
clustering</a> patches worked fifteen years ago, but they proved to be too
complex to be merged.  A larger page size can also break some applications
that expect to be able to map pages on a 4KB granularity.
<p>
Lameter has done some work on the "order N page cache", which would be able
to store pages of any order.  But he never got around to implementing
<tt>mmap()</tt>, he said, and the patch had too many fragmentation problems
to be merged.  An <a href="/Articles/686690/">alternative</a> is
transparent huge pages in the page cache.  The problem with that is that no
filesystem (other than tmpfs) supports it currently.  He has looked at
(ab)using the DAX mechanism to get huge-page mappings in ordinary memory;
one could also use DAX for real on nonvolatile memory.
<p>
Returning to the 4KB page-size issue, Lameter pointed out that, at that
size, about 2% of the system's memory is taken up by <tt>page</tt>
structures.  A system with 4TB of RAM must manage one-billion <tt>page</tt>
structures.  There are systems supporting 20TB of nonvolatile RAM coming
soon, he said; the overhead is becoming unsupportable.  But Dickins
said that he wasn't worried about a 2% space tax.
<p>
Almost any solution to Lameter's performance problems is going to require
more reliable allocation of large, physically contiguous memory areas.  He
has been playing with an XArray cache for memory chunks that would allow
them to be moved as needed.  Simple slab allocator support has been
implemented, but a lot of work is needed still; allocators need to provide
callbacks to allow memory chunks to be relocated.  Alternatives include
reserving memory at boot for large allocations, the <tt>MAP_CONTIG</tt>
option to <tt>mmap()</tt>, or Java-style garbage collection.  "But we are
all horrified" by that last idea, he said.
<p>
Rik van Riel suggested working with the filesystem developers to support
larger block sizes.  But some filesystems (XFS, for example) already have
that support; the real problem is in the page cache.  Dickins suggested
creating a mechanism like transparent huge pages that would
opportunistically allocate larger chunks for the page cache; those chunks
would be smaller than typical huge pages, though.
<p>
From that point on, the conversation went around in circles about whether
these performance issues are truly a hardware problem or not.  There was no
useful outcome from that discussion, though, and it petered out as beer
time approached.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As Intel found while developing DPDK for network acceleration, page table cache eviction in hardware was to be avoided. This was one of the major impetus for using huge pages in DPDK. The 2% tax for page tables may not be an issue for RAM utilization, but the number of hardware cache entries backing the page tables does become a problem. Whether this is the problem Christoph is running into would need more work, such as monitoring page cache eviction rates.<br>

As someone who has worked with i/o performance a lot, the basic problem tends to be the amount of per page overhead and contention when getting/marking dirty/freeing pages, along with the file system overhead per page, which can be significant.  Also, if we really got nice big pages, we could justify turning on the FPU and using those gorgeous vectorized memcopy instructions.  As is, at 4K page size with recent-ish Xeons, it’s slightly worse than a wash to do that, and that’s when the FPU isn’t really being used by userspace.  If it is, turning it on and off in kernel takes even longer.<br>
<p>
I’m a little surprised his numbers are so low - that’s more like a “single file” limit.  Perhaps that’s what he’s talking about.  For multiple files, I’ve seen more like 6.5 GB/s, and that system was network bandwidth limited at that point.  It was not limited primarily by the page cache.<br>
<p>
Page cache needs improving, though, for sure.  More batch operations would help some.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 9, 2015</br>
           </div>
The first <a href="/Articles/643797/">memory protection keys patch set</a>
showed up in May; it adds support for an upcoming feature in high-end Intel
processors.  This mechanism allows applications to assign an integer key
value to each of their pages; each key has associated with it
a protection mask that can deny
access regardless of what the regular protection bits say.  The
feature is 
useful as a way to quickly change the restrictions applying to large ranges
of memory without having to change each page's protection bits
independently.  Protection keys can support "read-mostly" memory, for
example, or make memory containing sensitive information (cryptographic
keys) entirely inaccessible most of the time.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/666882/">fifth version of the memory protection keys
patch set</a> has been posted.  The API that is proposed for this feature
has shifted considerably since May, so it merits another look.
<p>

Intel's memory protection keys feature works by making use of four
page-table bits to assign one of sixteen key values to each page.  A
separate register then allows the assertion of "write-disable" and
"access-disable" bits for each key value.  Setting the write-disable bit
for key seven, for example, will cause all pages marked with that key as
being read-only, even if the protection bits on those pages would otherwise
allow write access.  The write- and access-disable bits are local to each
thread, and they can be modified without privilege.  Since keys are
assigned to pages in the page-table entries, only the kernel can change
those. 

<p>
The original patch set allowed processes to assign keys to pages with any
system call that changed page permissions — <tt>mprotect()</tt> and
<tt>mmap()</tt>, for example.  Four new "permissions" bits were defined,
corresponding to the four bits of the key value.  This API ran into some
difficulties in the review process, though; it was criticized as being too
closely tied to 
one specific implementation of memory protection keys.  It might not extend
well even to future changes in Intel's mechanism, and might not fit equivalent
mechanisms on other processors at all.  So a rethink of the API was called
for.
<p>
In the middle of the discussion of this feature, Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/667174/">came up with</a> an interesting use case.  The
access-disable bit applies to data access, not execution access; as a
result, it can be used, in conjunction with the regular "execute access"
bit, to create regions of memory that can be executed by the processor, but
which cannot be read by the executing process.  That, he said, could be
used to frustrate attacks against address-space layout randomization that
read the executable text in order to try to locate a specific data
structure or chunk of code.  There could be security advantages to
protecting library code, at least, in this manner.
<p>
This idea seemed popular among the security-oriented developers in the
discussion.  Like anything else, this protection would not be absolute,
since the access-disable bit can be turned off.  But it adds another
barrier that must be overcome by an attacker; in many cases, it may be
enough to thwart an attack.
<p>
Fully implementing this feature could be challenging for a number of
reasons, not the least of which being that it's common to mix executable
and read-only data in an executable image.  Most of the work to implement
this feature would have to be done in user space, and is thus beyond the
immediate reach of the kernel community, but, as Ingo <a
href="/Articles/667177/">said</a>: "<q>That does not mean we can not
try!</q>"  As part of getting there, he suggested that, rather than just
giving user space total control over the protection keys, the kernel should
manage them and allocate them on request.  That would, among other things,
allow the kernel to reserve some keys for its own use in the future.
<p>
That suggestion was implemented in the fourth revision of the patch set in
the form of two new system calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int pkey_alloc(unsigned long flags, unsigned long init_access_rights)
    int pkey_free(int pkey);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> value to <tt>pkey_alloc()</tt> is currently unused and
must be zero.  The initial access restrictions associated with the
allocated key are provided in <tt>init_access_rights</tt>; either 
of the <tt>PKEY_DENY_WRITE</tt> and <tt>PKEY_DENY_ACCESS</tt> bits can be
set.  If a key is available for allocation, the kernel will allocate it and
return the associated key number as the return value from
<tt>pkey_alloc()</tt>.
<p>
If an application is done with a particular key, that key can be returned
to the system with <tt>pkey_free()</tt>.  The code does not check whether
any pages have that key value assigned to them; applications will want to
be careful there or surprising things might happen.
<p>
Assigning a key to a specific set of pages is done with the new
<tt>mprotect_key()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int mprotect_key(void *start, size_t len, unsigned long prot, int pkey);
</pre>
<p>
This system call will set both the page protections and the protection key
for the pages starting at <tt>start</tt> and extending for <tt>len</tt>
bytes.  The given <tt>pkey</tt> must have been allocated to the process
using <tt>pkey_alloc()</tt> or the call will fail.  For what it's worth,
this system call is called <tt>mprotect_pkey()</tt> and
<tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt> in other parts of the patch set, so the final name
may not yet be set in stone.
<p>
Comments on the patch set this time around have been relatively subdued; it
would seem that most developers have had their say and are happy with the
direction that this work is taking.  So it may find its way into the kernel
in a near-future development cycle.  What may take a bit longer, though, is
actual availability of hardware that supports this feature, which is slated
to first show up in <a

Memory protection keys should be emulated by the time QEMU 2.6 is released.  Still a few months away (2.5 is out next week), but closer and cheaper than Skylake server processors. :)<br>

Hmm. I wonder if this could be combined with the kernel keyring functionality. Any reason it couldn't be? I don't imagine that the userspace would have much to say about it, but having the keys locked to a specific kernel thread would be an improvement.<br>

I guess the terminology is confusing here. That's not the feature I was referring to. It was a feature which would allow a process to set up memory that only it could read (not even the kernel could read it). There were worries about DRM. My search-fu is failing me :( .<br>

Won't make any difference for distros though unless they add support for runtime binary diversification.  It doesn't matter if the code is non-readable when everyone in the world is running the exact same binaries.  There are ways it can be (ab)used for the kernel as well, even though it was designed for userland...<br>

On the surface, this sounds a lot like the Memory Attribute Indirection Register (MAIR) on ARM.<br>

That is, if the RWX bits were removed from block and page descriptors into the MAIR. Currently the MAIR doesn't have the RWX bits but rather attributes such as cacheability.<br>

Where is the syscall to change the access rights?  The special value of this PMK is the ability to *change* the protection quickly without touching any page tables.<br>

      There isn't one; as I understand it, changing the access flags is a simple, unprivileged operation, so no syscall is needed.

Yes, you can use the new RDPKRU and WRPKRU instructions to read or set which protection keys are allowed.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, the new instructions require register RCX to be zero, so it looks like they will evolve into a generic mechanism for "user-mode accessible special registers" (i.e. similar to MSRs, many of which aren't that much model-specific anymore, but for user space).<br>

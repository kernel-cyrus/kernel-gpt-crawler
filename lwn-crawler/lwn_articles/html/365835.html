           <p>December 9, 2009</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Steven Rostedt</p>
           </div>
<p>Ftrace is a tracing utility built directly into the Linux
kernel. Many distributions already have various configurations of Ftrace
enabled in their most recent releases. One of the benefits that Ftrace
brings to Linux 
is the ability to see what is happening inside the kernel.  As such, this
makes finding problem areas or simply tracking down that strange bug more
manageable.

<p>
Ftrace's ability to show the events that lead up to a crash gives a
better chance of finding exactly what caused it and can help the
developer in creating the correct solution. This article is a two part
series that will cover various methods of using Ftrace for debugging the
Linux kernel. This first part will talk briefly about setting up Ftrace,
using the function tracer, writing to the Ftrace buffer from within the
kernel, and various ways to stop the tracer when a problem is detected.</p>

<p>Ftrace was derived from two tools. One was the "latency tracer" by Ingo
Molnar used in the -rt tree. The other was my own "logdev" utility that had
its primary use on debugging the Linux kernel. This article will mostly
describe features that came out of logdev, but will also look at the
function tracer that originated in the latency tracer.</p>

<h4>Setting up Ftrace</h4>

<p>Currently the API to interface with Ftrace is located in the Debugfs
file system.  Typically, that is mounted at <tt>/sys/kernel/debug</tt>. For
easier accessibility, I usually create a <tt>/debug</tt> directory and
mount it there. Feel free to choose your own location for Debugfs.</p>

<p>When Ftrace is configured, it will create its own directory called
<tt>tracing</tt> within the Debugfs file system. This article will
reference those files in that directory as though the user first changed
directory to the Debugfs tracing directory to avoid any confusion as to where
the Debugfs file system has been mounted.</p>

<pre>
    [~]# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
    [tracing]#
</pre>

<p>This article is focusing on using Ftrace as a debugging tool. Some
configurations for Ftrace are used for other purposes, like finding latency
or analyzing the system.  For the purpose of debugging, the kernel
configuration parameters that should be enabled are:

<pre>
    CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
    CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
    CONFIG_STACK_TRACER
    CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
</pre>


<h4>Function tracing - no modification necessary</h4>

<p>One of the most powerful tracers of Ftrace is the function tracer. It
uses the <tt>-pg</tt> option of <tt>gcc</tt> to have every function in the
kernel call a 
special function "<tt>mcount()</tt>". That function must be implemented in
assembly because the call  does not follow the normal C ABI. 

<p> When CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE is configured the call is converted to a NOP
 at boot time to keep the system running at 100% performance. During
 compilation the mcount() call-sites are recorded. That list is used at
 boot time to convert those sites to NOPs. Since NOPs are pretty useless
 for tracing, the list is saved to convert the call-sites back into trace
 calls when the function (or function graph) tracer is enabled.


<p> It is highly recommended to enable CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE because of
 this performance enhancement. In addition, CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE gives the
 ability to filter which function should be traced.  Note, even though the
 NOPs do not show any impact in benchmarks, the addition of frame pointers
 that come with the <tt>-pg</tt> option has been known to cause a slight
 overhead.  </p>

<p>To find out which tracers are available, simply cat the
<tt>available_tracers</tt> file in the <tt>tracing</tt> directory:</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# cat available_tracers 
    function_graph function sched_switch nop
</pre>

<p>To enable the function tracer, just echo "function" into the
<tt>current_tracer</tt> file.</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo function &gt; current_tracer
    [tracing]# cat current_tracer
    function

    [tracing]# cat trace | head -10
    # tracer: function
    #
    #           TASK-PID    CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
    #              | |       |          |         |
                bash-16939 [000]  6075.461561: mutex_unlock &lt;-tracing_set_tracer
              &lt;idle&gt;-0     [001]  6075.461561: _spin_unlock_irqrestore &lt;-hrtimer_get_next_event
              &lt;idle&gt;-0     [001]  6075.461562: rcu_needs_cpu &lt;-tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick
                bash-16939 [000]  6075.461563: inotify_inode_queue_event &lt;-vfs_write
              &lt;idle&gt;-0     [001]  6075.461563: mwait_idle &lt;-cpu_idle
                bash-16939 [000]  6075.461563: __fsnotify_parent &lt;-vfs_write
</pre>

<p>The header explains the format of the output pretty well. The first two
items are the traced task name and PID. The CPU that the trace was executed
on is within the brackets. The timestamp is the time since boot, followed
by the function name. The function in this case is the function
being traced with its parent following the "<tt>&lt;-</tt>" symbol.</p>

<p>This information is quite powerful and shows the flow of functions
nicely.  But it can be a bit hard to follow. The function graph tracer,
created by Frederic Weisbecker, traces both the entry and exit of a
function, which gives the tracer the ability to know the depth of functions
that are called. The function graph tracer can make following the flow of
execution within the kernel much easier to follow with the human eye:</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer 
    [tracing]# cat trace | head -20
    # tracer: function_graph
    #
    # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
    # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
     1)   1.015 us    |        _spin_lock_irqsave();
     1)   0.476 us    |        internal_add_timer();
     1)   0.423 us    |        wake_up_idle_cpu();
     1)   0.461 us    |        _spin_unlock_irqrestore();
     1)   4.770 us    |      }
     1)   5.725 us    |    }
     1)   0.450 us    |    mutex_unlock();
     1) + 24.243 us   |  }
     1)   0.483 us    |  _spin_lock_irq();
     1)   0.517 us    |  _spin_unlock_irq();
     1)               |  prepare_to_wait() {
     1)   0.468 us    |    _spin_lock_irqsave();
     1)   0.502 us    |    _spin_unlock_irqrestore();
     1)   2.411 us    |  }
     1)   0.449 us    |  kthread_should_stop();
     1)               |  schedule() {
</pre>

<p>This gives the start and end of a function denoted with the C like
annotation of "<tt>{</tt>" to start a function and "<tt>}</tt>" at the
end. Leaf functions, which do not call other functions, simply end with a
"<tt>;</tt>".  The DURATION column shows the time spent in the
corresponding function. The function graph tracer records the time the
function was entered and exited and reports the difference as the
duration. These numbers only appear with the leaf functions and the
"<tt>}</tt>" symbol.  Note that this time also includes the overhead of all
functions within a nested function as well as the overhead of the function
graph tracer itself.  The function graph tracer hijacks the return address
of the function in order to insert a trace callback for the function
exit. This breaks the CPU's branch prediction and causes a bit more
overhead than the function tracer.  The closest true timings only occur for
the leaf functions.</p>

<p>The lonely "<tt>+</tt>" that is there is an annotation marker. When the
duration is greater than 10 microseconds, a "<tt>+</tt>" is shown. If the
duration is greater than 100 microseconds a "<tt>!</tt>" will be displayed.

<h4>Using <tt>trace_printk()</tt></h4>

<p><tt>printk()</tt> is the king of all debuggers, but it has a problem. If
you are debugging a high volume area such as the timer interrupt, the
scheduler, or the network, <tt>printk()</tt> can lead to bogging down the
system or can even create a live lock. It is also quite common to see a bug
"disappear" when adding a few <tt>printk()</tt>s. This is due to the sheer
overhead that <tt>printk()</tt> introduces.</p>

<p>Ftrace introduces a new form of <tt>printk()</tt> called
<tt>trace_printk()</tt>. It can be used just like <tt>printk()</tt>, and
can also be used in any context (interrupt code, NMI code, and scheduler
code). What is nice about <tt>trace_printk()</tt> is that it does not
output to the console. Instead it writes to the Ftrace ring buffer and can
be read via the <tt>trace</tt> file.</p>

<p> Writing into the ring buffer with <tt>trace_printk()</tt> only takes
around a tenth of a microsecond or so. But using <tt>printk()</tt>,
especially when writing to the serial console, may take several
milliseconds per write. The performance advantage of
<tt>trace_printk()</tt> lets you record the most
sensitive areas of the kernel with very little impact.

<p>For example you can add something like this to the kernel or module:</p>

<pre>
    trace_printk("read foo %d out of bar %p\n", bar->foo, bar);
</pre>

<p>Then by looking at the <tt>trace</tt> file, you can see your output.</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# cat trace
    # tracer: nop
    #
    #           TASK-PID    CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
    #              | |       |          |         |
               &lt;...&gt;-10690 [003] 17279.332920: : read foo 10 out of bar ffff880013a5bef8
</pre>

<p>The above example was done by adding a module that actually had a
<tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt> construct.</p>

<p><tt>trace_printk()</tt> output will appear in any tracer, even the
function and function graph tracers.</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer
    [tracing]# insmod ~/modules/foo.ko
    [tracing]# cat trace
    # tracer: function_graph
    #
    # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
    # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
     3) + 16.283 us   |      }
     3) + 17.364 us   |    }
     3)               |    do_one_initcall() {
     3)               |      /* read foo 10 out of bar ffff88001191bef8 */
     3)   4.221 us    |    }
     3)               |    __wake_up() {
     3)   0.633 us    |      _spin_lock_irqsave();
     3)   0.538 us    |      __wake_up_common();
     3)   0.563 us    |      _spin_unlock_irqrestore();
</pre>

<p>Yes, the <tt>trace_printk()</tt> output looks like a comment in the
function graph tracer.</p> 

<h4>Starting and stopping the trace</h4>

<p>Obviously there are times where you only want to trace a particular
code path. Perhaps you only want to trace what is happening
when you run a specific test. The file <tt>tracing_on</tt> is used to disable
the ring buffer from recording data:</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo 0 &gt; tracing_on
</pre>

<p>This will disable the Ftrace ring buffer from recording. Everything
else still happens with the tracers and they will still incur
most of their overhead. They do notice that the ring buffer is not recording and
will not attempt to write any data, but the calls that the tracers make
are still performed.</p>

<p>To re-enable the ring buffer, simply write a '1' into that file:</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo 1 &gt; tracing_on
</pre>

<p>Note, it is very important that you have a space between the number and
the greater than sign "<tt>&gt;</tt>". Otherwise you may be writing
standard input or output into that file.</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo 0&gt; tracing_on   /* this will not work! */
</pre>

<p>A common run might be:</p>

<pre>
    [tracing]# echo 0 &gt; tracing_on
    [tracing]# echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer
    [tracing]# echo 1 &gt; tracing_on; run_test; echo 0 &gt; tracing_on
</pre>

<p>The first line disables the ring buffer from recording any data. The
next enables the function graph tracer. The overhead of the function graph
tracer is still present but nothing will be recorded into the trace
buffer. The last line enables the ring buffer, runs the test program, then
disables the ring buffer. This narrows the data stored by the function
graph tracer to include mostly just the data accumulated by the
<tt>run_test</tt> program.</p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>The next article will continue the discussion on debugging the kernel
with Ftrace. The method above to disable the tracing may not be fast
enough. The latency between the end of the program <tt>run_test</tt> and
echoing the 0 into the <tt>tracing_on</tt> file may cause the ring buffer
to overflow and lose the relevant data. I will discuss other methods to
stop tracing a bit more efficiently, how to debug a crash, and looking at
what functions in the kernel are stack hogs. The best way to find out more
is to enable Ftrace and just play with it. You can learn a lot about how
the kernel works by just following the function graph tracer.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>That goes double for reviewers of Linux distributions. I've lost count of the number of reviews that don't review the out-of-the-box distribution, but rather review some author's preferences applied to that distribution.</p>

BTW, I noticed that if DEBUGFS is configured, the /sys/kernel/debug directory automatically is created. But why isn't the debugfs automatically mounted there? I mean, the /sys file system is already a pseudo system, why not have it automatically mount debugfs?<br>
<p>
If this was the case, I would not need to create a "find_debugfs()" function to search through mounts to find that directory in my tools.<br>
<p>
I do pick /debug because I usually do not do my tracing in the debugfs/tracing directory. And it is much easier to type /debug than to type /sys/kernel/debug (even with tab completion). I could also ln -s to /sys/kernel/debug, but if I have to do that, why not just mount it at /debug.<br>
<p>
Again, if /sys/kernel/debug automatically mounted debugfs, then a link would be reasonable.<br>

I guess these lines should be there in Setting up Ftrace<br>
<p>
HowTo mount the debugfs system:<br>
  # mkdir /debug<br>
  # mount -t debugfs nodev /debug<br>
<p>
Anyway simple and excellent article, specially trace_printk is something new to me, as i have observed the all problems listed due to printk.<br>
Waiting eagerly Part-II......<br>

Ftrace uses the debugfs file system to hold the control files as<br>
well as the files to display output.<br>
<p>
When debugfs is configured into the kernel (which selecting any ftrace<br>
option will do) the directory /sys/kernel/debug will be created. To mount<br>
this directory, you can add to your /etc/fstab file:<br>
<p>
 debugfs       /sys/kernel/debug          debugfs defaults        0       0<br>
<p>
Or you can mount it at run time with:<br>
<p>
 mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug<br>

I am trying to setup ftrace on a linux based android platform. I did the initial setups by enabling these below configs.<br>
CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_STACK_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE<br>
Built it and trying to see if it is working. But, I don't get any outputs from "trace". Inside the shell, I am trying the following. Can you please help find out what is missing to make it work?<br>
mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug/<br>
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo function &gt; current_tracer<br>
echo function &gt; current_tracer<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; tracing_enabled<br>
echo 1 &gt; tracing_enabled<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; tracing_on<br>
echo 1 &gt; tracing_on<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat trace<br>
cat trace<br>
# tracer: function<br>

# TASK-PID CPU# TIMESTAMP FUNCTION<br>

Solution:<br>
Tried multiple things and it was not working. Finally, got to know that removing "STRICT_MEMORY_RWX" Kernel config help solve the problem and I was able to do function tracing.<br>

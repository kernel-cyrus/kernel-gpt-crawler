<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>

<p>
There are lots of places in the kernel where an <tt>EINVAL</tt> can be
returned to user space, but it is often unclear what the actual underlying
problem is because the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html"><tt>errno</tt></a>
error codes are too generic.  That is the problem that Miklos Szeredi
wanted to discuss in a filesystem session that he led remotely at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He would like to help
those who are trying to debug problems trace where in the kernel a
particular error code is being generated.
</p>

<p>
Filesystem mounting is an example of where this problem can occur, Szeredi
said; there are lots of places where <tt>EINVAL</tt> is returned, so it
does not really tell anyone anything.  If he is debugging a kernel
filesystem and receives an error, he wants to know where in the code that
occurred.  The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html"><tt>strace</tt></a>
tool is useful for debugging, so ideally whatever is done to help show
where errors are coming from would integrate with it.
</p>

<p>
He does not think it would be difficult to add something along those lines,
though it would be best if any solution did not require root privileges.
He mentioned the existing solutions, which includes messages in dmesg, but
those are "not ideal for debugging".  For filesystems that use the <a href="/Articles/979166/">new
mount API</a>, there is a file descriptor returned from <tt>fsopen()</tt> that
can be used to read error messages.
</p>

<p>
Another possibility is using <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/ftrace.html">ftrace</a>, which can be used to trace the source
of certain errors, but the tracefs interface is difficult to use, he
said. The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd.1.html"><tt>trace-cmd</tt></a> tool is a more user-friendly interface, but it
does not yet support the <tt>funcgraph-retval</tt> option of the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/ftrace.html#function-graph-tracer">function_graph
tracer</a>, which is the way to get the information needed.  It would also be
nice if <tt>trace-cmd</tt> had an option to filter on negative return
values, which should be easy to add.  But it needs root privileges and has
a global scope, which makes it difficult to integrate with
<tt>strace</tt>.
</p>

<p>
He explored what an <tt>strace</tt>-friendly solution might look like.  He
suggested that an error descriptor could be added to
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.3/source/include/linux/sched.h#L748"><tt>struct&nbsp;task_struct</tt></a> so that when errors occurred, the code
could use
<tt>current-&gt;err_desc</tt> to store a string with information about where the error
was generated.  It should not be performance sensitive, he said, because
the error path should not be followed frequently.  He wondered if any
messages that were added would need to become part of the kernel ABI, thus
be unchangeable, or if
they could contain, say, a source file name and line number, which will
obviously change.
</p>

<p>
As an experiment, he tried redefining <tt>EINVAL</tt> and the other error codes
as macros that would create a tracepoint with the source file and line
number, but ran into 
multiple problems doing so.  For example, those values are used in <tt>switch</tt>
statements, conditional expressions, and in pre-setting a
variable with an error code; in each case, a macro replacement will cause
compilation or other problems.
</p>

<p>
The alternative is to use different macros for the different kinds
of uses of the error codes, so perhaps <tt>ERR_TRACE()</tt> in a return
statement to place the tracepoint.  More examples of the macros can be seen
in his slides as displayed in the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1xVINgWL3w">YouTube video of the
session</a>.  The problems with that kind of change are that it would
have to be done manually, would add
complexity, and would cause a lot of code churn.
</p>

<p>
But Amir Goldstein thought that the code churn would be "localized to
the person of interest" because it would only be done to a subsystem by
its maintainer if the maintainer is interested in getting the extra information.
Kent Overstreet said that the refactoring could be done <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/coccinelle.html">using
Coccinelle</a>, rather than manually.   He also thought there might be some
overlap with the infrastructure recently merged for the <a 
href="/Articles/974380/">memory-allocation
profiling work</a>  that he has been doing; he uses a large number of error
codes in bcachefs that effectively encode the source file and line number in them,
though they are mapped to regular <tt>errno</tt> values before being
returned to user space.
</p>

<p>
Aleksa Sarai was not entirely sure how useful it would be to simply get the
single data point of where the error code was set.  In his debugging
experience, seeing the entire call stack, as you can with ftrace, has
normally been needed.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that it was not clear what the use cases were for this
feature; was it meant to be for end users in some future RHEL kernel,
for filesystem developers, or for some other use case entirely?  There are
different tradeoffs depending on the use cases, he said.  As a user-space
developer, Omar Sandoval said he would like to see an easy way to get a string that
indicates where the <tt>EINVAL</tt> was generated, without having to deal
with tracepoints or ftrace at all.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi said that he sees the feature as being targeted at developers who
are debugging these problems, possibly remotely.  That is the use case that
he has personally
encountered most frequently.  He can see that it might also be useful for
returning information to applications.
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner said that he was probably responsible for adding 50 or
more <tt>EINVAL</tt> returns to the kernel over the years; each time he
does so, he wonders if he should also add a <tt>pr_info()</tt> call with
some extra information.  Traditionally, other kernel developers complain
when an extra call with more information gets added, he said, but if he was
working on his own project in user space, he would add them every time.
They are seen as dmesg noise by some, however.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein wondered how the kernel could provide the C library (libc) with
access to the string containing the source file and line number.
User-space programs access <tt>errno</tt> and use <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strerror.3.html"><tt>strerror()</tt></a>
to get more information, so somehow the kernel needs to provide any extra
information via a mechanism that libc can access. Szeredi
had proposed putting a string in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.3/source/include/uapi/linux/ptrace.h#L82"><tt>struct&nbsp;ptrace_syscall_info</tt></a>,
but libc does not have access to that.
</p>

<p>
Overstreet said that the new error codes
for bcachefs have "been enormously useful"; he tries not to reuse the
codes at all so they effectively indicate the code location.  David Howells said
that the libc mechanism could be a new system call to retrieve the
additional information; or user space could register a string buffer per
thread with the kernel where that information could be stored.  Ts'o
returned to the use-case question, though; some users are only going to be
interested in a high-level summary message, while developers may want a
series of low-level failure messages.  Those two use cases have different
requirements and he was concerned that the discussion was getting
complicated because it was trying to solve
both at once. 
</p>

<p>
Speaking of complications, Howells noted that there can also be errors
coming from a remote source,  for example from a network filesystem.  That
seemed to bring the discussion to a close, though it is rather unclear
what, if anything, had been decided.  The session was toward the end of the third
and final day of the summit, so attendees may well have been worn out at
that point.

If null pointers were the million dollar mistake then using inline integers as errors in C is the $999,999 mistake.<br>
<p>
Having worked with languages that give you actual detail in errors, e.g. Rust, it is absolutely painful every time some system call or C function or worse, a program using one of those, gives me something like "Permission denied" which is missing the vital information such as which operation was tried on which object by which user/group and who denied it (e.g. in the kernel which LSM and based on which policy rule).<br>
<p>
The amount of lifetime I have wasted as a sysadmin debugging problems only to figure out that e.g. a "Permission denied" was not about writing to the file but about reading a directory in its path or that a "No such file or directory" did not actually refer to a file at all because ENOENT meant something different in the context of whatever call was made or to figure out what EBUSY actually referred to is absolutely ridiculous, especially if you consider than 99% of the information is actually available in local variables or parameters at the point in the error path in the code that was taken.<br>

Rust's error system only shines, if you use it correctly. The usual "smash a question mark everywhere" often leads to the same nonsense permission-denied-style error messages.<br>
<p>
At the lowest level where the error is detected there often is not enough context to produce an error messages that makes sense upstream.<br>
<p>
However, error messages can be improved by giving them execution context. For example with the 'Context' trait from the 'anyhow' crate.<br>

<p>Any error messaging tool may be abused, because you can always turn error into `-1` and remove all other info in any conceivable system.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The usual "smash a question mark everywhere" often leads to the same nonsense permission-denied-style error messages.</font>

<p>Question mark is absolutely brilliant: it's unobtrusive enough that people don't try to invent schemes to avoid it and yet it still leaves <b>some</b> breadcrumbs for someone who want to redo things and improve error-messaging.</p>

<p>Any attempts to demand more (like in Java's checked exceptions) cause so much pain on “we only care about happy path” crowd that they invariably invent a way to hide all error handling completely (indeed, even Java 1.0 already had a means to do that because handling potential error from every array access is just ridiculously tedious).</p>

<p>I wouldn't say error handling “a solved problem” in Rust but it's much better than any other alternatives I tried. Precisely because question mark is just one character — and yet it's not zero characters like most other “simplifying solutions” do.</p>

      Often the problem is caused by sloppy programming. The application has the missing information, for example which file it tried to open. If the application omits this information in the error message, you will get the typical "Permission denied".

The problem is, if the application did not try to open some kind of file but some lower layer decided that it needs to read a file to do its task and then returns -EPERM on failure.<br>
The application might not even know that some kind of file is involved. The application cannot print the file path and the lower layers cannot pass it to the application. The best it can do is throw an error to stderr. Which comes with its own set of problems.<br>

      &gt; If null pointers were the million dollar mistake then using inline integers as errors in C is the $999,999 mistake.

<p>+10.  The enabling step is to change the source <tt>-Exxxxx</tt> into something like <tt>ErrGen(Exxxxx)</tt> which looks like a function call or a macro call.  This can be done selectively for some specific error codes, or in some subtree of source, etc.  Then hackers can experiment easily.  My personal favorite is to use a 64-bit encoding of some subset of {__FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__, ...} as a prelude to more elaborate tokenization of traceback, local data, and so on.

      <pre>My personal favorite is to use a 64-bit encoding of some subset of {__FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__, ...}</pre>

Stuffing more info into the upper bytes of errno is tempting since errno.h only goes up to 133.     The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/888914/">upper address ignore pointer-tagging feature</a> offers a relevant precedent.   That article notes

 <p><i>Applications can implement this sort of tagging now, but it must be done with care; an address with extra bits set is no longer a valid pointer, so that metadata must be masked out before dereferencing that pointer or passing it into code that does not understand the tagging scheme. That is error-prone and may slow down the application.</i></p>

Just so, if errno with upper bytes set is passed to unsuspecting code, then, for example,

<p><pre>if (-EBUSY == errno)</pre></p>

will break, as undoubtedly will strerror() itself.   A fascinating point according to "man strerror" is that strerror_l() takes a locale argument, which could be hacked to extract __LINE__, etc.   However, the real takeaway from the pointer-tagging article is the need for HW support to make these features usable:

<p><i>To make life easier for the developers of this sort of application, CPU manufacturers have been adding the ability for the processor to simply ignore the non-address bits in an address value.</i></p>

The obvious generalization is Plan 9’s errstr. That’s not perfect but it’s simple to understand and a huge advance on stuffing every possible condition into a single byte. <br>

      I've always thought the PostgreSQL approach to this problem was rather neat. They basically have a macro ereport() which can be used as follows. [1]
<p>
<pre>
ereport(ERROR, 
        (errcode(ERRCODE_OBJECT_NOT_IN_PREREQUISITE_STATE),
         errmsg("a backup is already in progress in this session")));
</pre>
The first parameter is the actual error code, but the remaining part can consist of hints, additional information, references to the relevant objects, etc. Because it's a bunch of macros, the underlying details can be hidden from the user, and it's recognisable for external tools trying to identify all the named errors.
<p>
So you can imagine an interface like:
<pre>
return kreport(EINVAL,
           (kerrfd(loopback_fd), 
            kerrmsg("Loopback file not readable")))
</pre>
where the additional information is stuffed into a per-task struct and then the -EINVAL returned as per usual. You could even chain the messages as they go up the chain. Extra macros could be added to record the driver, error codes from remote systems, etc.
<p>
The neat thing is, you don't need to do it all the time, but just in the error paths you expect end users to actually run into. Probably added in just a few dozen strategic places in the kernel could alleviate a lot of the pain.

At a former employer, we macroified essentially every error return in our proprietary filesystem.  When tracing was enabled, they could be logged to a ringbuffer; the contents could be extracted and examined in userspace.  I don't remember how well it interacted with multi-threading -- maybe ineffectively. It was somewhat useful for identifying where errors originated and the control flow that lead to returning them to userspace (in case it was ambiguous).<br>

<h1>The mini_fo filesystem</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 10, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Markus Klotzbuecher recently <a href="/Articles/135158/">announced</a> the
release of mini_fo 0.6.0.  Mini_fo provides (what has been called in other
systems) a "translucent" or "copy on write" filesystem.  A read-only, base
filesystem (possibly from a remote system or CDROM) can be made to appear,
via mini_fo, as a local, writable filesystem.  This functionality is useful
for sharing filesystems with local overrides, live CD systems, sandboxing
applications, and more. 
<p>

At its core, mini_fo performs a simple fan-out operation.  Each inode,
dentry, and file structure associated with a mini_fo filesystem contains
(via its private data) pointers to two other structures of the same type.
One of them refers to the file or directory on the base filesystem; the
other, instead, is for a local version of the file or directory on a local
"storage filesystem."  Both are hidden from user space, which thinks it is
dealing directly with a file stored in the mini_fo filesystem.

<p>
When a mini_fo filesystem is first created, it appears as an exact copy of
the underlying base filesystem.  Any operation which reads files or
directories is simply passed through to the base filesystem, with almost no
additional overhead.  In this mode, mini_fo functions as a sort of loopback
filesystem.
<p>

Things change, however, when a file is opened for writing.  In this case,
mini_fo will create a copy of the file on the storage filesystem, with all
of the data moved over.  Any subsequent operations on that file will used
the locally-stored version rather than the base version.  So any changes
made will appear locally, but they will not be propagated back to the
base.  Changes will be persistent across mounts as long as the storage
directory used by mini_fo is not modified by anything except mini_fo.
<p>

Modified files are not the full story, of course; mini_fo must also cope
with operations like deletes and renames.  To that end, it maintains a set
of lists of files which it knows about locally; there is one list for
modified files, one for deleted files, one for files created locally, etc.
These lists are stored in-kernel as standard linked lists.  They are also
written to the storage filesystem in a magic file (named
<tt>META_dAfFgHE39ktF3HD2sr</tt>, for what it's worth) and reloaded from
that file when the filesystem is mounted.
<p>

This release of mini_fo works with both the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  Its
author claims that it is intended for use with embedded systems, and thus
has a small memory footprint.  See <a
href="http://www.denx.de/twiki/bin/view/Know/MiniFOHome">the mini_fo web

      I was just thinking about translucent filesystems and userspace filesystems (the subject of another article in today's lwn kernel section).  How about
using a translucent filesystem to give unprivileged users "root" access?
What I mean is, mount "/" as a read-only base filesystem for these users,
but allow them to overlay changes (that would only be visible by them)
through a mechanism like mini_fo.  This would be one way to (safely?) let
unprivileged users install new software, without requiring any changes
in the way the software is packaged.
<p>
The first problem that occurs to me is that the root filesystem isn't
really static.  Can mini_fo deal with changes in the underlying 
filesystem?

This isn't safe.  Consider what happens if you let the unprivileged user overlay their own version of /etc/passwd.  They won't stay unprivileged for long.

      For now mini_fo can only deal to some extent with changes in the underlying file system, e.g. modifying existing files, even creating new files should be ok. What will definitely cause trouble is removing an file, what's like "pulling the carpet" you're standing on: the file system will expect to find a file that has gone.<br>
I've got advanced error recovery that will allow this on my Todo list though.<br>

      How does this compare and contrast with unionfs, which seems to be a longer-standing project to allow translucent filesystems?<br>
<p>
I'm really interested in this capability for a project I happen to be working on at the moment, actually.  Yet again LWN comes through with timely info!<br>

      Actually mini_fo has been around longer, it just didn't implement all features until the last release ;-)<br>
<p>
The main difference between unionfs and mini_fo is features and complexity. Unionfs allows to merge two and more branches with various options for each branch, while mini_fo focuses on merging only two, the base branch that will never be modified and the storage branch that contains the "diff".<br>
<p>
This "lack" of features makes mini_fo a lot smaller, what is important as we use it in embedded systems.<br>

      Are changes in the underlying filesystem tracked with some useful semantic<br>
guarantees or does it depend on it being static?  What happens if, for<br>
example, X is renamed to Y the overly and then Y is renamed to Z in<br>
the original filesystem?<br>

      I don't know the answer to that question in this case, but consider that<br>
a "rename" is really series of link and unlink operations (at the system<br>
call level).  Also a directory is a type of file (a list of link/inode<br>
pairs).<br>
<p>
Given those semantics I'd guess that a "rename" would unlink on the<br>
top/writable layer (writing a version of the directory that did NOT<br>
contain the link in question) and a link (possibly to that same directory<br>
possibly to another) resulting in more writes to the writable layer.<br>
This wouldn't affect the underlying inode (but that would probably<br>
be copied up from the lower layer to the write layer because the<br>
link count was incremented and then decremented).<br>
<p>
So know I have one or two directory "files" that contain updated<br>
contents (like any other file that got copied up to the writable<br>
layer).  The ls command (and other readdir() operations) will show<br>
the copy of the directory that does not contain the old name and does<br>
contain the new one.<br>
<p>
Is this making any sense?<br>
<p>
I do have to wonder what happens if you have multiple layers that are<br>
writable and mounted in multiple places (bind mounts of some layers<br>
outside of the stack).  That sounds ugly.<br>

      Renaming works differently for directories and non-directories. For example renaming a regular file will result in the file beeing marked as deleted (whiteouted), and then copied up to the storage branch with the new name. From now, renaming this file again will really only rename it in the storage branch.<br>
<p>
Renaming directories is a lot more complicated, because we don't want to copy up all directory contents (by the way, this is what "mv" does when a file system's rename function returns -ENOSUPP). So what happens is that the original directory is whiteouted, a new empty directory with the new name is created in storage and both directories are associated by a special meta tag that is saved in the meta-data.<br>
<p>
If you rename that directory in the underlying file system while the mini_fo file system is not mounted (you should not do this while it is mounted, see above post), this association will be broken, as mini_fo has no way to "detect" changes that occured while not mounted.<br>

<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, John Groves led
a session on famfs, which is a filesystem he has developed that uses the
kernel's <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/dax.html">direct-access (DAX)</a>
mechanism to access memory that is shareable between hosts.  The discussion
was aimed at whether a different approach should be taken and, in
particular, whether FUSE should be used instead of implementing as an
in-kernel filesystem.  As noted in the <a
href="/ml/all/20240229002020.85535-1-john@groves.net/">thread</a> about his
proposal for an LSFMM+BPF session, and the mailing-list discussions on <a
href="/ml/all/cover.1708709155.git.john%40groves.net/">the first</a> and <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1714409084.git.john@groves.net/">second
version</a> of his patch set, there is some skepticism that a new in-kernel
filesystem is warranted for the use case.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
Groves said that he works for a memory vendor that is trying to enable the
use of shareable memory; the "fam" stands for "fabric-attached memory".
The way to think about that, he said, "is taking what <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt>
does on a single host and making it possible to scale that out with shared
memory". That would allow processes on multiple hosts to map the same
shareable memory.  The memory would presumably be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link">Compute Express
Link</a> (CXL) memory, but nothing in famfs is CXL-specific, he said, famfs
just uses DAX and DAX devices that are shared.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/983713/">

alt="[John Groves]" title="John Groves" width=235 height=260>
</a>

<p>
He gave a quick introduction to shareable memory; it is memory that more
than one host can see, but it does not make sense to attach it as system
RAM, because system RAM gets zeroed when it is brought online.  So
shareable memory will be available in the form of shared DAX devices. 
A shared DAX device is a low-level abstraction that few software
applications know how to use.  But lots of applications know how to use
memory-mapped files with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
and the <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> flag, so the idea is to enable those applications to use
shareable memory.  Prior shareable-memory implementations have generally
added new abstractions to support this kind of memory, but applications
tend not to adopt them.
</p>

<p>
Famfs is "a filesystem but it's really memory not storage"; it uses DAX
devices but presumes they are not persistent.  It is effectively an
allocator where the allocations look like files, but it is not a
general-purpose allocator; for example, it uses 2MB granularity and
enforces huge-page alignment.
</p>

<p>
The metadata of the files is handled by famfs in a way that allows the
allocations to be shared between systems.  He "cribbed a lot of code" from
XFS, which is a filesystem that uses the fsdax mode, especially for the
read, write, and <tt>mmap()</tt> paths.  Famfs has a superblock and the
file metadata is stored in an append-only log of the allocation and
file-creation operations; the rest of the memory is referenced by files
once they have been allocated and created.  All of the files have a
preallocated size, so there is no allocation done at write time.  "We are
not trying to be a filesystem, except that the filesystem is where the
<tt>mmap()</tt> interface is."
</p>

<p>
The first version of the patch set could either use a character
<tt>/dev/dax</tt> device (devdax) or a block-based
persistent-memory (pmem) device (fsdax), but he dropped the pmem interface for
version&nbsp;2.  Using a DAX device requires adding iomap support for it, so
some of the preliminary patches in his series do so.  Devdax handles the
reads, writes, and page faults, requiring an upcall to user space for
mapping the file offset to an offset on the DAX device.
</p>

<h4>Why device DAX?</h4>

<p>
Jan Kara asked why the DAX device could not be exposed as a pmem device,
which is what filesystems currently target.  The difference is between
using a character device, which is what CXL exposes, and a block device,
which is what pmem devices are, Groves said.  Kara said that he wondered because the
filesystems that currently support DAX do so via the pmem interfaces; famfs
needed to replicate a bunch of code to work with character devices.  Groves
said that there was not all that much code that was needed to make it work;
in addition, pmem devices can be converted to DAX, but the reverse is not true.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Over the years, there has been some discussion about whether it makes sense
to be able to run a filesystem using the character-device interface, Groves
said.  Dan Williams said that the same question came up when the original
work on pmem was being done; it is not really a block device, but a
byte-addressable memory range.  "Block devices come with baggage that don't
make sense for a memory device."  The reason that devdax came about was to
essentially throw away the pieces that did not make sense for a memory
range.
</p>

<p>
Kara said that he did not see a problem with filesystems going straight to
devdax, rather than using pmem, but the existing DAX filesystems do not do
that.  Groves said that his patches would provide a path to change that,
but Williams was surprised that might be on the table.  Kara said that it
would not be, initially, but that maintaining two sets of infrastructure
did not make long-term sense.  He would like to see some convergence so
that all of the DAX filesystems used the same infrastructure, though he did
not have a strong opinion on which (devdax- or pmem-based) should be used.
There is already some precedent for filesystems that attach to character
devices, he said, such as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_Technology_Device">MTD</a> filesystems.
</p>

<p>
Groves said that the code in question is "quite small"; famfs is around
1000&nbsp;lines of kernel code.  It mostly consists of inode operations that are
"very ramfs-like".  The files are special, since they have the DAX flag set
and their metadata is cached so that page faults can be handled, but that is
mostly done in user space, which performs the space allocation, log-append, and
log-play operations.  The log-play operation reads the log and creates the files that
it says should exist, but that information is ephemeral metadata in memory,
which is never written to storage because there is nothing to write inodes
back to.
</p>

<h4>FUSE?</h4>

<p>
There are a number of companies testing famfs with various use cases.  The
main one is to "wrangle large data frames into a memory-efficient,
mmap-able format" for programs like <a
href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. Those files are put into
famfs so that a "distributed futures orchestrator" like <a
href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html">Ray</a> can allow multiple
jobs to consume the data in a distributed way.  The customers already know
how to do that using files, so they do not even need to know that these
files are special.  For those use cases, there is generally no need for
cache coherency between the systems because the data is written once when
it is created  and then used read-only
after that.
So a question that comes up is: since user space is doing most of the work,
could famfs be implemented using FUSE?
</p>

<p>
Groves said that he did a talk (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA_DgO95gLo">YouTube video</a>) about
famfs at the&nbsp;<a href="https://lpc.events/event/17/">2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>.  He has been working on it for around a year at
this point.  Beyond the kernel-space code, which is small as mentioned,
there are also around 5000&nbsp;lines of user-space code.  But Amir
Goldstein said that he did not like the lines-of-code metric; the problem
is in maintaining duplicate code. That new code has likely missed some
"subtle corner cases" that are not reflected in the counts.  It should
instead be looked at from the perspective of what functionality is missing
in FUSE or <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">virtiofs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Groves acknowledged that concern and said that there are two key
requirements for famfs; the current code is already meeting them.  It must
run at full memory speed, which means that page faults must be handled from
in-kernel cached metadata.  It also must distribute metadata in a way that
can be shared; users want to dump large datasets into famfs, such as data
frames or indexes that can be searched after mapping the file.  Currently,
famfs does not even support delete, though that could be added in a limited
way, but it does
not reallocate any of the space in the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
He is no FUSE expert, he said, but had some exchanges with Miklos Szeredi
about virtiofs and its use of FUSE; as far as Groves can tell, virtiofs
does not fit for famfs.  He believes that FUSE could be used directly for
famfs, but the 1000&nbsp;lines of code would just move from famfs to FUSE,
effectively. FUSE would need to allow famfs to cache an extent list; right
now, a famfs instance uses a single DAX device but he foresees that
changing eventually, so that a famfs could span more than one device.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein said that virtiofs just maps memory from the guest to the host
and simply provides an interface to do that.  Over the remote audio
interface, Szeredi said that he did not think it would be difficult to add
what famfs needed to FUSE; it is a special kind of FUSE
passthrough for the famfs files.  Adding the support for extents would be
useful for other use cases too. Williams asked if it would be able to work
with multiple hosts accessing the shared memory and Szeredi said that it
could.  It probably
does not matter if it is FUSE or famfs that is used to
implement it, Groves said, but famfs is always going to need to process its own metadata.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley asked if most of the sharing is handled by DAX, with famfs
just being a thin layer on top of that.  Williams said that DAX is just a
memory range, and that all of the properties of "how it is shared and
whether it is shared would come from famfs".  It provides a way to have
shared metadata, Groves said, "and I punted on most of the hard problems".
The metadata is all managed in user space, which is why people are talking
about FUSE for famfs, Bottomley said.  If there are just a few interfaces
that need to be added to FUSE, that's probably the easier path.  Groves is
not opposed to using FUSE, though he is "slightly dubious" that the two are
actually all that similar.
</p>

<p>
Kara said that he did not know how feasible it was to use FUSE, that was
best left to Goldstein and Szeredi, but he was concerned that famfs was
heading down the well-trod path of starting with something simple that will
only get more complicated due to feature creep.  First it might be adding
deletion, then users will ask for hole punching, and so on; this seems to
always happen to the "simple" filesystems that are proposed.  If it gets
merged, it will not be so simple in five years.
</p>

<p>
The second thing that worries Kara is what the testing picture looks like
for a filesystem that is mostly implemented in user space.  When filesystem
interfaces change, that will affect famfs, so it will need to be tested,
but its setup is all done in user space, which is non-standard for kernel
filesystems. He would like to see "a good story of how other filesystem
developers can work" with famfs.  The advantage of FUSE is that the other
filesystem maintainers do not have to worry unless they are changing the
FUSE interfaces directly.  This makes him lean toward seeing famfs as a
FUSE filesystem.
</p>

<p>
Groves said that it is pretty straightforward to test famfs, though it does
require setting up a DAX device, which can be done with a kernel
command-line option.  The shared part is a bit more tricky, but can be
tested using multiple virtual machines; he has real shared memory in his
lab but still does a lot of testing with virtual machines.  Goldstein noted
that the session had run out of time, but suggested that Groves use the
existing subsystems and if he encounters problems in doing so that he bring
them up on the mailing lists.

Actually this upcall is just from devdax to famfs - in the kernel. It's the same code path as resolving XFS files to Dax memory.<br>

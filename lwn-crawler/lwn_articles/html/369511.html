           </div>
Improving the performance of the kernel is generally a good thing to do;
that is why many of our best developers have put considerable amounts of
time into optimization work.
One area which has recently seen some attention is in the handling of soft
page faults.  As the course of this work shows, though, performance
problems are not always where one thinks they might be; sometimes it's
necessary to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, possibly
dumping a lot of code in the process.
<p>
Page faults can be quite expensive, especially those which must be resolved
by reading data from disk.  On a typical system, though, there are a lot of
page faults which do not require I/O.  A page fault happens because a
specific process does not have a valid page table entry for the needed
page, but that page might already be in the page cache, in which case
handling the fault is just a matter of fixing the page table entry and
increasing the page's reference count; this happens often with shared
pages or those brought in via the readahead mechanism.
Faults for new anonymous pages (application data and stack space, mostly),
instead, can be handled through the  
allocation of a zero-filled page.  In either case, the fault is quickly taken
care of with no recourse to backing store required.
<p>
In many workloads, this kind of "soft" fault happens much more often than
hard faults requiring actual I/O.  So it's important that they be executed
quickly.  Various developers had concluded that the kernel was, in fact,
not handling this kind of fault quickly enough, and they identified the use
of the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> reader/writer semaphore as the core of the
problem.  Contention wasn't the issue in this case - only a reader lock is
required for page fault handling - but the cache line bouncing caused by
continual acquisition of the lock was killing performance.  As the number
of cores in systems increases, this kind of problem can only get worse.
<p>
In response, Hiroyuki Kamezawa posted the first <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/362104/">speculative page fault patch</a>
back in November.  The core idea behind the patch was to try to handle page
faults without taking <tt>mmap_sem</tt> at all.  Doing so invites race
conditions; in particular, the <tt>vm_area_struct</tt> (VMA) structure
which controls the memory mapping can change while the work is in
progress.  So the speculative fault code must handle the fault, then check for
concurrent changes and, if necessary, redo the work the older, slower way.
That's the "speculative" part: doing the work in a lockless mode in the hope
that the world will not change in the meantime and force that work to be done
again. 
<p>

The speculative page fault code must also ensure that no changes which
could create real trouble (such as freeing the VMA outright) can happen
while the fault is being handled.  To this end, various versions of the
patch have tried techniques like adding reference counts to the VMA
structure or using read-copy-update with the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184495/">red-black tree code</a> (which is
used to locate the VMA covering a specific address within an address space)
to defer changes while the speculative code is doing its thing.

<p>
This work yielded some real results: the number of page faults per unit
time that the system could handle, when running a fault-heavy benchmark,
approximately doubled.  The idea clearly had merit, but Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/Articles/369536/">felt</a> that Kamezawa-san's patches
"<q>weren't quite crazy enough</q>".  He set out to rectify this
problem with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/368533/">a speculative page
fault patch of his own</a>, which saw a number of revisions.  Peter's
approach included the addition of speculative page table locks and the use
of RCU to manage VMA structures.  The result was a patch which would
"sometimes boot" and which seemed to improve performance.
<p>
This is about when Linus got involved, pointing out <a
href="/Articles/369537/">some</a> <a href="/Articles/369538/">problems</a>
with Peter's patch, concluding:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I would say that this whole series is _very_ far from being
	mergeable.  Peter seems to have been thinking about the details,
	while missing all the subtle big picture effects that seem to
	actually change semantics.
</div>
<p>
Peter agreed with this conclusion, noting that he'd never thought it was
ready yet.
<p>
It was in further discussion that Linus, looking at a profile of page fault
handling activity, <a href="/Articles/369539/">noticed something funny</a>:
the real overhead seemed to be in spinlock operations, which shouldn't be
involved in the x86-optimized rwsem implementation at all.  It turns out
that said optimization was only applied to 32-bit systems; on 64-bit
builds, reader/writer semaphores were using the generic, semaphore-based
implementation.  That meant that they were rather slower than they needed
to be.
<p>
So Linus <a href="/Articles/369540/">tossed out</a> a new rwsem
implementation based on the x86 exchange-and-add (<tt>xadd</tt>)
instruction with a typical warning:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In other words: UNTESTED! It may molest your pets and drink all
	your beer.  You have been warned.
</div>
<p>
Kamezawa-san bravely tried the code anyway, and got <a
href="/Articles/369542/">an interesting result</a>.  His pets and his beer
both came through without trauma - and the page fault performance was better than
with his speculative fault patch.  Peter, too, <a
href="/Articles/369543/">ran some tests</a> against his own speculative code;
those results showed that the rwsem change tripled page fault performance.
His speculative fault patch improved performance by just a tiny bit more
than that, and the two together a little more yet.  But the rwsem patch is a
small and clear fix, while the speculative page fault patch is large,
widespread, scary, and with known problems.  So nobody really disputed
Peter's conclusion:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So while I think its quite feasible to do these speculative faults,
	it appears we're not quite ready for them.
</div>
<p>
As of this writing, nobody has posted a final version of the rwsem patch.
Linus has noted that there are things which can be improved with it, but it
would be fairly typical for him to leave that work to others.  But, one
assumes, some version of this patch will be waiting in the wings when the
2.6.34 merge window opens.  It will be a clear demonstration that
low-hanging performance fruit exists even in our highly-optimized kernel;
one need only think to look in the right place.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

So basically he took the rwsem implementation from x86 and ported it <br>
to x86_64?<br>

Why did the x86 and x86_64 implementations differ so significantly in <br>

It just wasn't implemented for 64-bits and as fallback it used the generic<br>

Yea, the more I read on LKML and the Linux x86-64 mailing lists, the more I think that developing the x86-64 port separately from the main x86 port was a big mistake in the first place. Look at the way the ACPI SRAT support was developed on the 32-bit and 64-bit side for an example, ACPI SRAT is supposed to be a *standard*, but before it was finally fixed in the year 2008, 32-bit SRAT/NUMA only worked for Summit systems, and not Opterons. Another example is AMD64 IOMMU support, which could have been supported on 32-bit Linux with PAE, but never was. It is now being gradually being fixed, but it was still stupid to do it in the first place.<br>

<p>
Four bytes may not seem like a lot of space&mdash;typically it
isn't&mdash;but when that space is wasted millions of times, it starts to
add up. In addition, if the extra space has become part of the kernel ABI
(intentionally or not), it will be difficult to remove it.  That particular
problem came up again in a recent linux-kernel discussion regarding the
trace event 
header. 
</p>

<p>
Just over a year ago, we <a href="/Articles/442113/">looked</a> at the
unused <tt>lock_depth</tt> field in event headers.  Frederic Weisbecker had
added the field temporarily to assist in removal of the big kernel lock
(BKL), and once 
the BKL was gone Steven Rostedt removed those, now useless, four bytes from the
header.  Unfortunately, in the interim, PowerTOP had started accessing
events in the perf ring buffer, so removing <tt>lock_depth</tt> broke
PowerTOP.  That field wasn't actually used by PowerTOP, but the tool
expected the header to have a particular size, which changed after
Rostedt removed the wasted space.
</p>

<p>
That led to a reversion of the removal, which means that every
event recorded by ftrace or perf has added overhead.  The event format is
fully self-describing, however, so there is no need for utilities like
PowerTOP to grub around in the binary data making assumptions about what
the format is.  It was, however, easier to read the data directly rather
than parse the format description, which is why PowerTOP did so.
 Rostedt has created a library to parse
trace events using the format data that the kernel provides to avoid that
situation in the future.  That
library was picked up by the <a
href="https://01.org/powertop/blogs/ceferron/2012/powertop-v2.0-release">recently
released PowerTOP 2.0</a>, so Rostedt <a href="/Articles/498194/">posted an
RFC</a> asking when the <tt>lock_depth</tt> field&mdash;renamed to
<tt>padding</tt> as part of the revert&mdash;could be removed.
</p>

<p>
Linus Torvalds was <a
href="/Articles/498213/">not particularly concerned</a> about the wasted space, but did want
to understand which distributions were picking up the new PowerTOP.  It
turns out that the version in Fedora 14 (which Torvalds said he still uses
sometimes) is old enough that it doesn't use perf
events at all, so it is unaffected.  More recent Fedoras (16, 17) are using
PowerTOP 1.98 which won't work with kernels built without the padding.
</p>

<p>
The assumption in the thread is that distributions will be picking up
PowerTOP 2.0 for releases coming later in the year, but that still leaves
users who build their own kernels on existing distributions in a bit of a
bind if the padding is removed.  Existing distributions also have
various lifespans, and some will not be picking up the latest PowerTOP at all.
Rostedt <a 
href="/Articles/498228/">asked</a> how long the kernel needed to support
older distributions.  PowerTOP, it seems, is in a different category from
other applications
because it is a developer-oriented tool.  So Torvalds was <a
href="/Articles/498229/">willing</a> to see the kernel change even if some
distributions get left behind:
<div class="BigQuote">
But breaking something like a F14-15 timeframe distro or
something staid like a SLES (or "Debian Stale" or whatever they call
that thing that only takes crazy-old binaries)? It's fine. We don't
want to *rush* into it, but no, if those distros are basically not
updating, we can't care about them forever for something like
powertop.
<p>
Things that break *normal* applications are different. There the rule
really must be "never".
</div>
</p>

<p>
Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/498232/">concurred</a>, pointing to 3.6
as a potential time frame to remove the padding, noting that those who
haven't updated their distribution to get the newer PowerTOP are unlikely
to be updating their kernel either. Rostedt said he will
queue the patch up for 3.6 or 3.7. 
</p>

<p>
While the four bytes seems unimportant to both Torvalds and <a
href="/Articles/498235/">Ingo Molnar</a>, Rostedt <a
href="/Articles/498239/">pointed out</a> that it is a frequent problem for
tracing users.  Beyond that, though, he <a
href="/Articles/498236/">disagrees</a> with Molnar's contention 
that the wasted space is merely a "<q>cosmetic detail</q>":
<div class="BigQuote">
4 bytes is not cosmetic for a 32 byte event. That's 1/8th overhead. If
we could get rid of 4 bytes from struct page, would we do that? It's
only just 4 bytes for [every] 4096 bytes. Just a 1/1024 overhead. Of course
perf events are much bigger than 32 bytes. It's one of the biggest
complaints I hear about perf, the size of its events. We should be
trying hard to fix that.
</div>
</p>

<p>
For memory-constrained situations, for example on embedded devices or for users
trying to squeeze every process they can onto their systems, reducing the
overhead of events can make a difference.  By capturing more events in the
same amount of memory, there is a better chance of finding the problem that
tracing was enabled for.  When the issue came up a year ago, David Sharp of
Google <a href="/Articles/442341/">noted</a> that the size of events was a
big problem for the search giant.  Others undoubtedly face similar challenges.
</p>

<p>
While the format of the perf ring buffer data may soon be a solved
problem&mdash;though it's possible, if unlikely, that other tools are
manually pulling data from the ring buffer&mdash;tracepoints as a whole are
still an 
unresolved ABI issue.  Right now, much of the work is in adding new
tracepoints, but some day one or more of those may need to come out or be
modified.  If tools are dependent on specific tracepoints providing the
exact same 
information in just the right place in the code, changing those will be a
real problem.  And it will be one that is difficult for a library to paper over.

The real PowerTOP 1.x (up to 1.2 I think) doesn't use perf events at all, so it is unaffected.<br>
<p>
The problem is PowerTOP 1.9x versions, which are actually prereleases (beta) of 2.0, but already shipped by some distros. In my opinion, they should just update to 2.0 since it's a bugfix update over the 1.9x branch.<br>

Well, sounds to me like the kernel didn't actually break its promised ABI -- PowerTOP didn't respect the event description so it misused the ABI.<br>

<p>
True but unfortunately that doesn't matter. As <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/300">Linus pointed out</a>:
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">And if binaries don't use the interface to parse the format (or just parse it wrongly - see the fairly recent example of adding uuid's to /proc/self/mountinfo), then it's a regression.</font>
<p>
[...]
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">If you made an interface that can be used without parsing the interface description, then we're stuck with the interface. Theory simply doesn't matter.</font>
<p>
Basically it came down to the fact that we didn't push the library that parses the data strong enough. And we also made it too easy for apps to circumvent the library. Peter Zijlstra once asked me to make the field order random, to keep tools from doing this (before PowerTop actually did), but to do so would have added a high overhead to tracing, that I did not think was worth it at the time. Then when this happened, I realized that I was mistaken.
<p>
If the author of PowerTop wasn't a kernel developer, I highly doubt we would have had this problem. But the author was and for him, it was much easier to look at what the kernel code was doing and access it directly than to create a parsing library. I do not blame him for this. It was our fault for letting this happen.

      Linus:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Linus is always oversimplifying things.  I know he doesn't really believe that the kernel is stuck with an interface just because kernel developers made it possible for someone to consider it to exist.  It simply isn't technically possible to prevent someone from using an intended interface that wasn't intended.
<p>
Linus' real and more reasonable policy would probably be better exemplified by:
<blockquote>
If an important user found a way to use your interface without parsing the interface description, then we're stuck with the interface.

Quite. Why hack the binaries when you can have binfmt_elf.c detect affected binaries at runtime and slam in a binary patch? Plus, that works everywhere (FSVO 'everywhere' equal to 'on the machine it was tested on') and makes debugging when you don't know the feature is there so much more exciting!<br>

So far as I know Windows doesn't patch third-party code in memory, but it does enable compatibility quirks on a per-process basis based on recognition of certain programs. In some cases that approach may be superior to maintaining the old behaviour for all programs - the usual reason for wanting to change the implementation is to improve performance, and Windows can provide that improvement for most programs.<br>
<p>
Linux does have per-process compatibility quirks (see setarch(8)) but no provision for enabling them automatically.  I'm not sure why, though it may be that such recognition would be better implemented in userland.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Right now, much of the work is in adding new tracepoints, but some day one or more of those may need to come out or be modified. </font><br>
<p>
Actually some tracepoints have already been removed, at least in this i915 commit from Feb 2011:<br>
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=db53a3026">http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-...</a><br>
<p>
e.g. i915_gem_request_submit was removed (in favor of a more generic tracepoint), and it was used by PowerTop to determine GPU ops/s. PowerTop got patched for that in December.<br>

They should add a CONFIG_BREAK_PERF option which randomly adds padding to perf events, and a CONFIG_BREAK_PERF_HARDER option which randomly removes fields from the events.<br>
<p>
Utilities which can deal with event formats changing would keep working, with just a bit of performance loss (or information loss in the second case), and utilities which do not parse the format description would break. Even better, by being a config option it would now be part of the ABI: perf events can change randomly from one boot to another, so you better use the format description.<br>
<p>
(Now you have to decide if I am joking or if this was a serious suggestion. Or both.)<br>

I got used to updating modutils and pcmcia-tools when I built a new kernel.  The new modprobe still worked with the old kernel. Is this case really any different?<br>

Maybe the kernel developers can stick some logic in the make files that goes and checks all the installed software on your system and will refuse to compile if any of them get broken by a ABI change.<br>

Well that wouldn't work if you got a kernel built by somebody else, so maybe they need to add a runtime checker that will cause the kernel to refuse to boot if it breaks any of your software. That way you know when you need to update your userland. :P<br>

Why not handle it the same way they handled the stale udev API -- twice?  Just create a kconfig option for legacy-powertop-compatible event headers.  New distros using the new powertop can simply turn it off, as can users building their own kernel who either don't use powertop or use a new enough version, while the distros and users building new kernels for an old distro install can turn it on if they need to.<br>
<p>
Then, after some time (preferably somewhat longer than the 3.6/3.7 timeframe mentioned in TFA, we're already in the 3.5 cycle, after all, and 3.7 could well be before year-end), that option could disappear.  But meanwhile, only folks unwilling to upgrade what was after all a 2.0-pre-release powertop to the full 2.0+, would have to suffer the additional overhead.<br>

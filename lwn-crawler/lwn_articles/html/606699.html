           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/604609/">Control groups</a>
</div>
<p>In earlier articles, we have looked at hierarchies in general and at
how hierarchy is handled by specific cgroup subsystems.  Now, it is
time to draw all of this together to try to understand what sort of
hierarchy or hierarchies are needed and how this can be supported in
the current implementation.  As was recently <a href="/Articles/601840/">reported</a>, the 3.16 Linux
kernel will have under-development support for a so-called "unified
hierarchy".  The new ideas introduced with that development will not
be discussed yet, as we cannot really appreciate what value they might
bring until we fully understand what we have.  A later article will
unpack the unified hierarchy, but for now we will start by
understanding what might be called the "classic" cgroup hierarchies.</p>

<h4>Classic cgroup hierarchies</h4>

<p>In the classic mode, which may ultimately be deprecated, but is still
fully supported, there can be several separate cgroup hierarchies.
Each hierarchy starts its life as a root cgroup, which initially holds
all processes.  This root node is created by mounting an instance of
the "cgroup" virtual filesystem and all further modifications to the
hierarchy happen through manipulations of this filesystem,
particularly <code>mkdir</code> to create cgroups, <code>rmdir</code> to remove cgroups and
<code>mv</code> to rename a cgroup within the same parent.  Once the cgroups are
created, processes can be moved between them by writing process id
numbers into special files. When a suitably privileged user writes a PID number to <tt>cgroup.procs</tt> in
  a cgroup, that process is moved, from the cgroup it currently resides in
  to the target cgroup.</p>

<p>This is a very "organizational" way to manipulate a hierarchy: create
a new group and find someone to fill it.  While this may seem natural
for a filesystem-based hierarchy, we shouldn't assume it is the best
way to manipulate all hierarchies.  The simple hierarchy of sessions
and process groups that we found in 4.4BSD works quite differently.
There is no distinction between creating a group and putting the first
process in the group.  

<p>
We should assess the mechanisms for
manipulation by considering whether they are fit-for-purpose, as well
as whether they are convenient to implement. If the goal is to allow
processes internal to the hierarchy, this 
     mechanism is quite suitable.  If we were to prefer to keep all processes
     in the leaves, it doesn't seem so well suited.</p>

<p>When a hierarchy is created, it is associated with a fixed set of
cgroup subsystems.  The set can be changed, but only if the hierarchy
has no subgroups below the root, so, for most practical purposes, it is
fixed.
Each subsystem can be attached to at most one hierarchy, so, from the
perspective of any given subsystem, there is only one hierarchy, but no
assumptions can be made about what other subsystems might see.</p>

<p>Thus it is possible to have 12 different hierarchies, one for each
subsystem, or a single hierarchy with all 12 subsystems attached, or
any other combination in between.  It is also possible to have an
arbitrary number of hierarchies each with zero subsystems attached.
Such a hierarchy doesn't allow any control of the processes in the
various cgroups, but it does allow sets of related processes to be
tracked.</p>

<p>Systemd makes use of this feature by creating a cgroup tree mounted
at <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd</code> with no controller subsystems.  It
contains a <code>user.slice</code> sub-hierarchy that classifies processes
that result from login sessions, first by user and second by
session.  So:
<pre>
    /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/user.slice/user-1000.slice/session-1.scope
</pre>

<p>represents a cgroup that contains all the processes associated with
the first login session for the user with UID 1000 (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.slice.5.html">slice</a> and
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.scope.5.html">scope</a> are terms specific to systemd).</p>

<p>These "session scopes" seem to restore one of the values of the
original process groups in V7 Unix â€” a clear identification of which
processes belong to which login session.  This probably isn't very
interesting on a single-user desktop, but could be quite valuable on a
larger, multi-user machine.  While there is no direct control possible
of the group, we can tell exactly which processes are in it (if any)
by looking at the <tt>cgroup.procs</tt> file.  Provided the processes aren't
forking too quickly, you could even signal all the processes with
something like:</p>
<pre>
    kill $(cat cgroup.procs)
</pre>

<h4>The tyranny of choice</h4>

<p>Probably the biggest single problem with the classic approach to
hierarchy is the tyranny of choice.  There seems to be a lot of
flexibility in the different ways that subsystems can be combined:
some in one hierarchy, some in another, none at all in a third.
The problem is that this choice, once made, is system-wide and
difficult to change.  If one need suggests a particular arrangement of
subsystems, while another need suggests something different, both needs
cannot be met on the same host.  This is particularly an issue when
containers are used to support separate administrative domains on
the one host.  All administrative domains must see the same
associations of cgroup subsystems to hierarchies.</p>

<p>This suggests that a standard needs to be agreed upon.  Obvious
choices are to have a single hierarchy (which is where the "unified
hierarchy" approach appears to be headed) or a separate hierarchy for
each subsystem (which is very nearly the default on my openSUSE 13.1
notebook: only <code>cpu</code> and <code>cpuacct</code> are combined).  With all that we
have learned so far about cgroup subsystems, we might be able to
understand some of the implications of keeping subsystems separate or
together.</p>

<p>As we saw, particularly in <a href="/Articles/605039/">part 3</a>, quite
a few subsystems do not 
perform any accounting or, when they do, do not use that accounting to
impose any control.  These are <code>debug</code>, <code>net_cl</code>, <code>net_perf</code>,
<code>device</code>, <code>freezer</code>, <code>perf_event</code>, <code>cpuset</code>, and <code>cpuacct</code>.  None of
these make very heavy use of hierarchy and, in almost all cases, the
functionality provided by hierarchy can be achieved separately.</p>

<p>A good example is the <code>perf_event</code> subsystem and the <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf</code></a>
program that works with it.  The <code>perf</code> tool can collect performance data for a
collection of processes and provides various ways to select those
processes, one of which is to specify the UID.  When a UID is given,
<code>perf</code> does not just pass this to the kernel to ask for all matching
processes, but rather examines all processes listed in the <code>/proc</code>
filesystem, selects those with the given UID, and asks the kernel to
monitor each of those independently.</p>

<p>The only use that the <code>perf_event</code> subsystem makes of hierarchy is to
collect subgroups into larger groups, so that <code>perf</code> can identify just
one larger group and collect data for all processes in all groups
beneath that one.  Since the exact same effect could be achieved by
having <code>perf</code> identify all the leaf groups it is interested in
(whether they are in a single larger group or not) in a manner similar
to its selection of processes based on UID, the hierarchy is really
just a minor convenience â€” not an important feature.  For similar
reasons, the other subsystems listed could easily manage without any
hierarchy.</p>

<p>There are two uses of hierarchy among these subsystems that cannot
be brushed away quite so easily.  The first is with the <code>cpuset</code>
subsystem.  It will sometimes look upward in the hierarchy to find extra
resources to use in an emergency.  This feature is an intrinsic
dependency on hierarchy.  As we noted when we first examined this
subsystem, similar functionality could easily be provided without
depending on hierarchy, so this is a minor exception.</p>

<p>The other use is most obvious in the <code>devices</code> subsystem. It
relates not to any control that is imposed but to the configuration
that is permitted: a subgroup is not permitted to allow access that
its parent denies.  This use of hierarchy is not for classifying
processes so much as for administrative control.  It allows upper
levels to set policy that the lower levels must follow.  An
administrative hierarchy can be very effective at distributing
authority, whether to user groups, to individual users, or to
containers that might have their own sets of users.  Having a single
administrative hierarchy, possibly based on the one that systemd
provides by default, is a very natural choice and would be quite
suitable for all these non-accounting subsystems.  Keeping any of them
separate seems to be hard to justify.</p>

<h4>Network Traffic Control â€” another control hierarchy</h4>

<p>The remaining subsystems, which are the ones most deserving of the
term "resource controllers", manage memory (including <code>hugetlb</code>), CPU,
and block-I/O resources.  To understand these it it will serve us to
take a diversion and look at how network resources are managed.</p>

<p>Network traffic can certainly benefit from resource sharing and usage
throttling, but we did not see any evidence for network resource control in
our exploration 
of the different cgroup subsystems, certainly not in the same way as
we did for block I/O and CPU resources.  This is particularly relevant
since one of the documented justifications for multiple hierarchies, as
mentioned in a <a href="/Articles/484251/">previous article</a>, is that there can be a credible
need to manage network resources separately from, for example, CPU
resources.</p>

<p>Network traffic is in fact managed by a separate hierarchy, and this
hierarchy is even separate from cgroups.  To understand it we need at
least a brief introduction to Network Traffic Control (NTC).
The NTC mechanism is managed by the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html"><tt>tc</tt></a> program.  This tool allows a "queueing discipline" (or
"qdisc") to be attached to each network interface.  Some qdiscs are
"classful" and these can have other qdiscs attached beneath them, one
for each "class" of packet.  If any of these secondary qdiscs are also
classful, a further level is possible, and so on.  This implies that
there can be a hierarchy of qdiscs, or several hierarchies, one for
each network interface.</p>

<p>The <code>tc</code> program also allows "filters" to be
configured. These filters
guide how network 
packets are assigned to different classes (and hence to different
queues).  Filters can key off various values, including bytes within
the packet, the protocol used for the packet, or â€” significant to
the current discussion â€” the socket that generated the packet.  The
<code>net_cl</code> cgroup subsystem can assign a "class ID" to each cgroup that
is inherited by sockets created by processes in that cgroup, and this
class ID is used to classify packets into different network queues.</p>

<p>Each packet will be classified by the various filters into one of
the queues in the tree and then will propagate up to the root,
possibly being throttled (for example by the Token Bucket Filter, <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-tbf.8.html"><code>tbf</code></a>,
qdisc) or being competitively scheduled (e.g. by the Stochastic Fair Queueing,
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-sfq.8.html"><code>sfq</code></a>, qdisc).  Once it reaches the
root, it is transmitted.</p>

<p>This example emphasizes the value in having a hierarchy, and even a
separate hierarchy, to manage scheduling and throttling for a
resource.  It also shows us that it does not need to be a separate
<i>cgroup</i> hierarchy.  A resource-local hierarchy can fit the need
perfectly and, in that case, a separate cgroup hierarchy is not needed.</p>

<p>Each of the major resource controllers, for CPU, memory, block I/O, and
network I/O, maintain separate hierarchies to manage their resources.
For the first three, those hierarchies are managed through cgroups, but
for networking it is managed separately.  This observation might
suggest that there are two different sorts of hierarchies present
here: some for tracking resources and some (possibly one
"administrative hierarchy") for tracking processes.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt?v=3.15#L106">example
in <code>Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt</code></a>
does 
seem to acknowledge the possibility of a single hierarchy for tracking
processes but worries that it "<q>may lead to [a] proliferation of
... cgroups</q>".  If we included the <code>net_cl</code> subsystem in
the systemd  
hierarchy described earlier, we would potentially need to create
several sub-cgroups in each session for the different network
classes that might be required.  If other subsystems (e.g. <code>cpu</code> or
<code>blkio</code>) wanted different classifications within each session, a
combinatorial explosion of cgroups could result.  Whether or not this
is really a problem depends on internal implementation details, so we
will delay further discussion of this until the next article, which
focuses on exactly that subject.</p>

<p>One feature of cgroups hierarchies that is not obvious in the NTC
hierarchies is the ability to delegate part of the hierarchy to a
separate administrative domain when using containers.  By only
mounting a subtree of a cgroup's hierarchy in the namespace of some
container, the container is limited to affecting just that subtree.
Such a container would not, however, be limited in which class IDs can
be assigned to different cgroups.  This could appear to circumvent any
intended isolation.</p>

<p>With networking, the issue is resolved using virtualization and
indirection.  A "veth" virtual network interface can be provided to
the container that it can configure however it likes.  Traffic from
the container is routed to the real interface and can be classified according
to the container it came from.  A similar scheme could work for block
I/O, but CPU or memory resource management could not achieve the same
effect without full KVM-like virtualization.  
These would require a different approach for administrative delegation,
    such as the explicit sub-mount support that cgroups provides.
</p>

<h4>How separate is too separate?</h4>

<p>As we mentioned last time, the accounting resource controllers need
visibility into the ancestors of a cgroup to impose rate limiting
effectively and need visibility into the siblings of a cgroup to effect
fair sharing, so the whole hierarchy really is important for these
subsystems.</p>

<p>If we take the NTC as an example, it could be argued that these
hierarchies should be separate for each resource.  NTC takes this even
further than cgroups can, by allowing a separate hierarchy for each
interface.  <code>blkio</code> could conceivably want different scheduling
structures for different block devices (swap vs database vs logging),
but that is not supported by cgroups.</p>

<p>There is, however, a cost in excessive separation of resource control,
much as there is (according to some) a cost in the separation of
resource management as advocated for micro-kernels.  This cost is the
lack of "effective co-operation" identified by Tejun Heo as part of
the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/unified-hierarchy.txt">justification</a> for a unified hierarchy.</p>

<p>When a process writes to a file the data will first go into the page
cache, thus consuming memory.  At some later time, that memory will be
written out to storage thus consuming some block-I/O bandwidth, or
possibly some network bandwidth.  So these subsystems are not entirely
separate.</p>

<p>When the memory is written out, it will quite possibly not be written
by the process that initially wrote the data, or even by any other
process in the same cgroup.  How, then, can this block-I/O usage be
accounted accurately?</p>

<p>The memory cgroup subsystem attaches extra information to every page
of memory so that it knows where to send a refund when the page is
freed.  It seems like we could account the I/O usage to this same
cgroup when the page is eventually written, but there is one problem.
That cgroup is associated with the memory subsystem and so could be in
a completely different hierarchy.  The cgroup used for memory
accounting could be meaningless to the blkio subsystem.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways that this disconnect could be resolved:</p>

<ol>
<li>

Record the process ID with each page and use it to identify what
   should be charged for both memory usage and block-I/O usage, as both
   subsystems understand a PID.  One problem would be that processes
   can be very short lived.  When a process exits, we would need to
   either transfer its outstanding resource charges to some other
   process or a cgroup, or to just discard them.  This is similar
   to the issue we saw in the CPU scheduler, where accounting just to a
   process would not easily lead to proper fairness for process
   groups.  Preserving outstanding charges efficiently could be a
   challenge.</p>
</li>

<li>

Invent some other identifier that can safely live arbitrarily
   long, can be associated with multiple processes, and can be used by
   each different cgroup subsystem.  This is effectively the "extra
   level of indirection" that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection">proverbially</a> can solve any problem in
   computer science.</p>

<p>The class ID that connects the <code>net_cl</code> subsystem with NTC is
   an example of such an identifier.  While 
   there can be multiple hierarchies, one for each interface, there is
   only a single namespace of class ID identifiers.</p>

<li>Store multiple identifiers with each page, one for memory usage
   and one for I/O throughput.

<p>The <code><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/page_cgroup.h?v=3.15#L18">struct page_cgroup</a></code> structure that is used to store extra
   per-page information for the memory controller currently costs 128
   bits per page on a 64bit system â€” 64 bits for a pointer to the
   owning cgroup and 64 bits for flags, 3 of which are defined.  If an
   array index could be used instead of a pointer, and a billion
   groups were deemed to be enough, two indexes and an extra bit could
   be stored in half the space.  Whether an index could be used with
   sufficient efficiency is another exercise left for the interested
   reader.</p>
</ol>

<p>A good solution to this problem could have applicability in other
situations: anywhere that one process consumes resources on behalf of
another.  The <code>md</code> RAID driver in Linux will often pass I/O requests
directly down to the underlying device in the context of the process
that initiated the request.  In other cases, some work needs to be done
by a helper process that will then submit the request.  Currently, the CPU
time to perform that work and the I/O throughput consumed by the
request are charged to <code>md</code> rather than to the originating process.
If some "consumer" identifier or identifiers could be attached to each
I/O request, <code>md</code> and other similar drivers would have some chance of
apportioning the resource charges accordingly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no good solution to this problem exists in the current
implementation.  While there are costs to excessive separation, those
costs cannot be alleviated by simply attaching all subsystems to the
same hierarchy.</p>

<p>In the current implementation, it seems best to keep the accounting
subsystems, <code>cpu</code>, <code>blkio</code>, <code>memory</code>, and <code>hugetlb</code>, in separate
hierarchies, to acknowledge that networking already has a separate
hierarchy thanks to the NTC, and to keep all the non-accounting
subsystems together in an administrative hierarchy.  These will depend
on intelligent tools to effectively combine separate cgroups when
needed.</p>

<h4>Answers ...</h4>

<p>
  We are now in a position to answer a few more of the issues that arose in
  an earlier article in this series.  One was the question of how groups are
  named.  As we saw above, this is is the responsibility of whichever process
  initiates the <tt>mkdir</tt> command.  This contrasts with job control process
  groups and sessions, for which the kernel assigns a name in an (almost)
  arbitrary way when a process calls <tt>setsid()</tt> or
  <tt>setpgid(0,0)</tt>.  The 
  difference may be subtle, but it does seem to say something about the
  expected authority structures.  For job control process groups, the
  decision to form a new group comes from within a member of the new group.
  For cgroups, the decision is expected to come from outside.  Earlier, we
  observed that embodying an administrative hierarchy in the cgroups
  hierarchy seemed to make a lot of sense.  The fact that names are assigned
  from outside aligns with that observation.

<p>Another issue was whether it was possible to escape from one group into
another.  Since moving a process involves writing the process ID to a
file in the cgroup filesystem, this can be done by any process with
write access to that file using normal filesystem access checks.  When
a PID is written to that file, there is a further check that the owner
of the process performing the write is also the owner of the process
being added, or is privileged.  This means that any user can move any
of their processes into any group where they have write access to
<code>cgroup.procs</code>, irrespective of how much of the hierarchy that
crosses.</p>

<p>Put another way, we can restrict where a process is moved <em>to</em>, but
there is much less control over where it can be moved <em>from</em>.  A
cgroup can only be considered to be "closed" if the owners of all
processes in it are barred from moving a process into any cgroup
outside of it.  Like the hierarchy manipulations looked at earlier,
these make some sense when thinking about the cgroup hierarchy as though it
were a filesystem, but not quite as much when thinking about it as a
classification scheme.</p>

<h4>... and questions</h4>

<p>The biggest question to come out of this discussion is whether there
is a genuine need for different resources to be managed using
different hierarchies.  Is the flexibility provided by NTC well beyond
need or does it set a valuable model for others to follow?
A secondary question concerns the possibility for combinatorial
explosion if divergent needs are imposed on a single hierarchy and
whether the cost of this is disproportionate to the value.
In either case, we need a clear understanding of how to properly
charge the originator of a request that results in some service process
consuming any of the various resources.</p>

<p>Of these questions, the middle one is probably the easiest:  what
exactly are the implementation costs of having multiple cgroups?  So
it is to this topic we will head next time, when we look at the various
data structures that hook everything together under the hood.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I feel that NTC solves a different problem. It has to deal with network packets that have no relation to running processes, so its design is perforce quite different.<br>
<p>
And from a personal point of view - qdisc interface is hell to use. Cgroups filesystem-based interface is an order of magnitude simpler.<br>

Thanks for your insights.<br>
<p>
With qdisc, is it just the interface that is "hell to use", or might there be something deeper?<br>
i.e. if someone created a FUSE filesystem interface, or a nice GUI which made the current structures easy to visualize and manipulate, would you expect that to make it heaven to use, or is there some issue that cannot be automated away?<br>

Probably a bit of both. An interface with integer handles is not easy to use - nice textual names instead of major:minor pairs would have helped a lot. Then there's the problem with error messages (they are opaque) and discoverability of settings.<br>
<p>
And conceptually I never understood why qdisc is separate from iptables.<br>

As an interface to the kernel integer handles are fine, see file descriptors for example.<br>
<p>
But as a method of control by humans they are horrid. What was (is?) really needed is some kind of declarative language where you could describe what you want to achieve and then some compiler would compile that into a tc commands for you.<br>

These is (or was) such a thing.  It's called tcng.  Sadly it's been unmaintained for a over a decade now.<br>
<p>
A for the earlier comment "we should just use iptables", the reason hard core tc user doesn't want that is speed.  Yes, iptables is easy to use, but it's naturally linear.  A packet going through 20 or 30 rules is not at all uncommon.  Yes, you can code your rules so that doesn't happen, but then it's not so easy to use.  With tc's u32 on the other hand you don't have a choice.  Every rule is just a 32 bit load, mask and compare, and possibly a jump via a hash table.  You tend to use hash tables, so the number of rules evaluated is stuff all.  As a consequence it runs like a scalded cat.  There is some syntatic sugar, but it has the effect of turning what is essentially a machine language into assembler language.<br>
<p>
But yes, speed concerns aside using one filtering language every place a filter is used seems like it would be a utopia compared to what we have now.  And there are a lot of such places - ip route, ip rule, iptables, and u32 spring to mind.  But if you are going to do that speed is of the absolute essence.  A declarative language that is easily compiled and optimised into something like a u32 virtual machine seems like it could work.<br>
<p>
I had hoped nftables give us an interface like that, but as far as I can tell it doesn't quite get there.  It's compiled and all, but it is still encourages the user write a set of rules that are executed linearly.  That makes it hard to optimise it to the same extent a hand u32 filter would be.<br>

      <p>I find the following difficult to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
If we included the net_cl subsystem in the systemd hierarchy described earlier, we would potentially need to create several sub-cgroups in each session for the different network classes that might be required. If other subsystems (e.g. cpu or blkio) wanted different classifications within each session, a combinatorial explosion of cgroups could result.
</blockquote>

<p>It isn't immediately clear to me how "create several sub-cgroups in each session" would work at all.</p>

<p>The Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt file is of a little help, but not sufficient for me to fully understand the alternative.  It describes a scenario that the admin can raise the capability of a task temporarily in only one of the subsystems but not others.  I can imagine that, instead of using a student's own quota in CPU when working for a professor, he can be configured to use the quota of the professor just for the CPU when running the simulator program.</p>

What I don't see is, how that can be achieved without multiple hierarchies, even if creation of many sub-cgroups is allowed?  Sure we can create a sub-cgroup of "student" as "student with professor cpu quota", but that cgroup cannot simultaneously be the child of the student cgroup and the professor cgroup with a single hierarchy.  Perhaps it will all become very clear once part 7 is read.

Thanks for asking - I did wonder if I had explained that well enough.<br>
<p>
If we wanted to set the network class for sockets created by one set of processes that "joe" creates to "3" and for sockets created by some other set to "4", then in each session owned by "joe" we need two cgroups.  Maybe call them "netcl_3" and "netcl_4".<br>
If we have some other users logged  in they will also each need "netcl_3" and "netcl_4" in their "session scope" cgroup.<br>
<p>
These are the "several sub-cgroups in each session".  We can assign lots of different cgroups the network class number of '3' and lots of others the network class number of '4'.<br>
<p>
Suppose that we also want to restrict different process to different CPU sets, but this division of processes is quite independent of the divisiion by network class.  Suppose there are two interesting sets of CPUs called "A" and "B".<br>
<p>
Then each different session needs 4 cgroups:  "netcl_3_cpu_A", "netcl_3_cpu_B" "netcl_4_cpu_A" "net_cl_cpu_B" (though other arrangements are possible).<br>
<p>
If you wanted a different breakdown for imposing device access restrictions (for example) you would need many more groups, in each session.  This is the "combinatorial explosion".<br>
<p>
This only really works for the non-accounting cgroups.  For CPU and memory you cannot achieve a useful effect by multiplying cgroups like this (at least I, like you, cannot see how).<br>

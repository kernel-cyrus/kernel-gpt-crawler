           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 16, 2008</br>
           <hr>
LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2008/">2008 Kernel Summit coverage</a>
</div>
Prior to this year's kernel summit, Alan Cox had <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296588/">suggested</a>  a possible
topic: devote a development cycle to the removal of old, unused features -
possibly breaking compatibility in places - and release the result as
Linux&nbsp;3.0.  Alan did not attend the summit itself (the fact that it is
being held in the U.S. was enough to ensure that), but his suggested topic
was the first order of business.  The result: it looks like there is no Linux 3.0
forthcoming right away, and the removal of older features is not on the
agenda.
<p>
There was some talk about the cost of maintaining older drivers and
interfaces which are used by few people.  This code requires updates for
API changes and may contain security holes.  In many cases, the drivers are
for hardware which is unable to support features needed by contemporary
software, with the result that users complain about tools like PulseAudio
not working properly.
<p>
Linus came into the discussion early to state his unhappiness with the
idea.  The cost of maintaining these old drivers, he asserts, is
essentially zero.  And, in places where there are costs, that is OK with
him as well.  In particular, it's fine with Linus if API changes are a
pain; he wants developers to have to think about whether an API change is
worth the trouble or not.
<p>
Linus also pointed out that a lot of hardware which kernel developers see
as being useless junk is, in fact, still useful in many parts of the
world.  There are a lot of people using old stuff, and he does not want to
pull the rug out from under them.  He is also not concerned about claims of
possible security problems with the older code; should such problems exist,
he says, they will affect so few people that it's really not worth the
trouble for any self-respecting cracker to exploit.  So, he concluded, any
sort of driver removal might end up getting rid of all of five drivers,
which is probably not worth the effort.
<p>

James Bottomley expressed concern that, by disclaiming concern about things
like security issues, we could be creating a two-tier system of support.
Older hardware may be nominally supported, but no developers are really
interested in keeping the code up, and nobody has the hardware to test
them.
<p>
Christoph Hellwig pointed out that creating a major release which only
removed features would be a "marketing disaster."
<p>

From there, the discussion began to drift a bit.  Dave Jones suggested (to
general applause) that
a useful thing to deprecate would be the "deprecated" marker used within
the kernel source.  Deprecated functions generate large numbers of
warnings, but nobody bothers to fix them; all the deprecation warnings
really do is mask other, more important warnings.  Christoph noted that the
checkpatch.pl script can also warn about deprecated functions, and that it
was a much better place for it: there, the warnings affect the person
submitting a patch instead of everybody building a kernel.
<p>

Then it was suggested that, perhaps, a concerted effort should be made
toward the removal of all warnings from the kernel build.  That idea did
not get very far either.  Quite a few warnings from GCC are bogus, in that
they are complaining about entirely valid code.  Fixing warnings like that
risks masking other problems and introducing bugs in its own right.
Christoph suggested that the warning issue could only really be resolved
when we start shipping GCC with the kernel source.
<p>

The sparse tool was discussed for a bit; the warnings generated by sparse
are seen as being more useful much of the time.  But, as Linus noted,
sparse has its own set of bogus diagnostics and is not a perfect solution
either.
<p>

Heading back toward the original topic, the developers talked about the
maintenance of ancient system call compatibility interfaces.  Linus talked
about how nice it is to know that we can still run binaries from 1991; we
should be proud of that fact.  The associated cost is, once again, quite
small.  Matt Mackall then said that, if we are continuing to maintain those
interfaces forever, there is little point in discussing the removal of
other interfaces.
<p>

The end result from this discussion would appear to be that there will be
no change.  Compatibility with old hardware and interfaces remains a
priority for the kernel, especially as long as the cost of retaining that
compatibility is small.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Does anyone *try* to run binaries from 1991? The last person I heard of running binaries of remotely that age was Alan Cox, and as I understand it he stopped some time ago.<br>
<p>
I know a.out support is routinely broken for fairly long stretches of time, and nobody notices.<br>
<p>
We can still run binaries from 1991, *in theory*. The practice seems to be quite different.<br>
<p>
IMHO we could probably drop all syscalls that were obsolete before the a.out-&gt;ELF transition without anyone noticing for a very long time indeed. (a.out support itself might be trickier to drop: is anyone still using it anywhere?)<br>

the article quotes christoph hellwig that a feature-removal-only release with a major version number bump would be a "marketing disaster".<br>
i don't really think so. all else failing, it is weird enough to generate some press. maybe some burnt-out microsoft marketing guy will jump on it with the usual uninspired advertisement, but among the informed public and the press it might serve to make a really valid point: janitorial work is valuable, and users profit from it in the medium to long term. <br>
and it also makes another point: open source is (or should be, or can be) about beauty and sound engineering under the hood, not just on the UI layer.<br>
<p>
of course, that doesn't invalidate the other concerns about a 3.0 as envisioned by alan cox.<br>

In fact the same goes for individuals who want to use older systems as secondary computers.  I have only just thrown out a 12 year old 486 laptop that was a Linux firewall in its later years, and I still sometimes use Ethernet cards of similar vintage in other laptops.<br>

Only if you think that the newer kernels do not have security bugs, which seems not to be the case. On the other hand, contemporary crackers, script kiddies might look for only newer bugs and miss the old ones.<br>
<p>
Anyway, as far as I know, some bugs in the 2.4.x series are still being fixed. I guess that 2.4.&lt;late&gt; would run on the same hardware as the more than 7 years old 2.4.0.<br>

new kernels may have new bugs, but they also fix a lot of old bugs.<br>
<p>
yes, most bugs that are being fixed were introduced durng the 2.6 days, that could be because there have been more lines of code writen for 2.6 then for all prior kernels combined (I don't know that for sure, but with the pace of development that's happening in 2.6 I would not at all be surprised)<br>

Last I looked, 2.4.36.7 was only released recently. Many of the current security bugs have only been introduced in the 2.6 series, so some people even prefer the stable and tried 2.4 for security reasons. If you want to use your 80286, it might be fully sufficient.<br>

LOL.  16-bit processor without an MMU.  ELKS supports it, but (a) ELKS is moribund and (b) it never tracked mainline Linux security updates.<br>

</P><P>
I'll take that answer as a "yes" to my question. Perhaps you do not realize some of the other nifty things that kernels do besides support hardware, especially the linux kernel? :)
</P>
If I have old hardware, do you think I do not want?:
<ul>
<li> New advanced more robust filesystems (ext3/4, xfs, jfs, reiserfs, fuse, unionfs, brtfs, glusterfs...)
</li><li> New networking protocol support, iptables...
</li><li>  Security fixes/new security models (SELinux, apparmor...)
</li><li>  Improved schedulers, i/o, process, elevators...
</li><li>  Improved block management features, lvm2, drbd, nbd, iscsi...
</li><li>  Performance improvements (futexs, pipe io, select/poll........)
</li><li>  Real time improvements, low latency...
</li><li>  Containerazation support
</li><li>  User api improvements .......
</li><li>  General bug fixes ......
</ul>

<p>

In fact, I am embarrassed to say that I probably haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg of non hardware features that someone with an old kernel might want since I am too ignorant.  But, surely you should be able to realize that newer kernels in linux mean a lot more than newer hardware support!

The point is not circular. It is "it does not work and nobody with development skills care enough, so don't make it work".<br>
<p>
Except that there are contemporary lightweight distributions, even if sometimes not based on glibc. Indeed, glibc bloat is probably the reason for which new distros are slow. The kernel isn't light either - Matt Mackall has been working on Linux-tiny, but most developers are happy to trade memory for speed, from the point of view of a 486 user, and they are indeed right: by current standards, nobody would say they trade memory for speed so easily :-).<br>

Features and drivers come in handy.<br>
<p>
Ancient hardware with a USB port can talk to modern USB devices - if you have the driver which only exists in a modern kernel.<br>

Ancient hardware does new-fangled iptables rules and other IP tricks very nicely.  Not fast, but it works.<br>

Even filesystem improvements are good on ancient hardware.<br>

I would also agree with Linus on keeping old drivers.<br>
Most of my hardware is old and runs Linux quite well.<br>
Including a 486 66mhz with 12mb ram and a pentium 133mhz with 32 ram.<br>
Why should new features and bug fixes be out of reach because they want to remove drivers that can be configurable at compile time and thus take no space. Also the development time for such a driver is small.<br>

Support for UEFI secure boot has been available in most mainstream Linux
distributions for several years now, 
but there are still some wrinkles to work out.  Some distributors are
concerned about various ways for the root user to alter the kernel in ways
that would allow the secure-boot assurances to be circumvented.  For years,
there have 
been efforts to "lock down" the kernel so that the known ways of evading
secure boot can be disabled by distributions and others.  The latest piece
of that puzzle is a proposal to 
annotate kernel module parameters 
such that some can be disallowed when a secure-boot kernel is running. 
</p>

<p>
Back in November, David Howells <a href="/Articles/706637/">posted</a> the
latest version of the "kernel lockdown" patches, which he has picked up and
expanded from those <a href="/Articles/514985/">pushed by Matthew
Garrett</a> back in 2012 and 2013.  The patch set restricted a lot of
different functionality that would allow user space to modify the running
kernel image (which, in turn, allows user space to circumvent secure
boot).  The restrictions disallow things like loading unsigned kernel
modules, writing to <tt>/dev/mem</tt> or <tt>/dev/kmem</tt>, using
<tt>kexec_load()</tt> to run a different kernel, 
various ways to directly access the hardware, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Previous iterations of the patch set have run aground at least partly due
to the <tt>kexec_load()</tt> restrictions,
because some kernel developers did not want to see the useful kexec
facility completely disabled.   An
alternative system call (<tt>kexec_file_load()</tt>) was added that will
<a href="/Articles/603116/">only allow booting signed 
kernels</a>, which neatly solved things for both sides.
This time, the main objection 
came from Alan Cox, who <a href="/Articles/708256/">thought</a> there was a
fundamental piece missing:
<div class="BigQuote">
You need to filter or lock down kernel module options because a lot of
modules let you set the I/O port or similar (eg mmio) which means you can
hack the entire machine with say the 8250 driver just by using it with an
mmio of the right location to patch the secure state to zero just by
getting the ability to write to the modules conf file.
<p>
Without that at least fixed I don't see the point in merging this. Either
we don't do it (which given the level of security the current Linux
kernel provides, and also all the golden key messups from elsewhere might
be the honest approach), or at least try and do the job right.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Essentially, Cox is arguing that changing certain kernel module parameters
before loading a (signed) module is yet another avenue for modifying the
kernel image.  His objection led Howells to quickly post an <a
href="/Articles/708271/">RFC patch of sorts</a> that would restrict certain
operations in drivers when <tt>kernel_is_locked_down()</tt> is true.  While
that was on the right track, Cox <a href="/Articles/708272/">said</a>, he
would rather see a whitelist-based approach, rather than the
blacklist-based one that Howells proposed.
</p>

<p>
All of that led to the <a
href="/Articles/707851/">module parameter annotation patch set</a> that Howells
posted on December&nbsp;1.  The idea is that all module parameters will be
annotated to describe what kind of hardware resource they control (if
any).  That information can be used in a subsequent patch to restrict which
can be used in a locked-down kernel.

<p>
The change was made by altering the <tt>module_param*()</tt> macros, which
are helpers for modules that need to take parameters at load time.  An
argument was added for the "hardware type" and the macros were renamed to
<tt>module_param_hw*()</tt>.  As can be seen in the <a
href="/Articles/708274/">first patch</a> of the series, the types are I/O
port, I/O 
memory address, interrupt number, DMA
channel, DMA address, or other.  The change made in the <a
href="/Articles/708371/">second patch</a> demonstrates the idea:
<pre>
    -module_param(mmio_address, ulong, 0);
    +module_param_hw(mmio_address, ulong, iomem, 0);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The other 37 patches in the series annotate various module parameters
throughout the tree 
(mostly, of course, in <tt>drivers/</tt>).  But Greg Kroah-Hartman was <a href="/Articles/708276/">not
particularly impressed</a> ("<q>ick ick ick</q>") with the idea.  He
suggested that the secure boot patch set (i.e. kernel lockdown) was not
going anywhere, so there was no need for the annotations.  Furthermore, he
was skeptical that stopping root users from setting these module parameters
was really going to help stop secure-boot abuses.
</p>

<p>
Garrett <a href="/Articles/708321/">noted</a> that the patch set was
currently being carried by "<q>basically every single mainstream Linux distribution</q>", however.
This costs time and effort by the distributions to rebase the patches on newer
kernels.  Beyond that, at least some of the module parameters can be used
to route around secure boot:
<div class="BigQuote">
If root can tell a driver to probe for hardware at a specific address, 
and that driver will then blindly do so, root is trivially able to 
modify arbitrary kernel memory and disable arbitrary security features. 
IRQ or io port attacks are much more difficult to take advantage of, but 
I could imagine that some of them are still plausible.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Given that distributions ship the lockdown patches, and that Cox has said
that some way to disable module parameters should be part of that, Garrett
argued that the annotations should be merged unless there were technical
objections to the implementation.  Kroah-Hartman was <a href="/Articles/708324/">not buying that
argument</a>, though.  Distributions are <i>not</i> shipping the annotations
and the annotations patches don't actually disable anything, they just make
it possible to do so, he said.  He also suggested simply marking all module
parameters (or any 
that touch the hardware) as "bad", rather than trying to pick and choose
which were usable for a locked-down kernel.
</p>

<p>
But the annotations have other uses, Cox <a
href="/Articles/708325/">said</a>.  Locking down raw I/O access, even for
systems that are not running under the secure-boot restrictions, is
valuable.  Right now, certain unrelated capabilities can be used to
effectively get the <tt>CAP_SYS_RAWIO</tt> capability by loading modules with
crafted parameters, but the kernel could eliminate that possibility by
using the annotations.
</p>

<p>
Howells also <a href="/Articles/708327/">wondered</a> about the seemingly
contradictory ordering requirements from Kroah-Hartman and Cox: "<q>for
Alan, I have 
to fix the module parameter hole first; for you, I have to do the secure boot
support first</q>".  Like Cox, though, Howells thinks the annotations
have value in their own right: "<q>However, annotation [of] module parameters
to indicate hardware resource configuration seems potentially useful in its
own right - and lets the policy be decided later.</q>"
</p>

<p>
There does seem to be something of a rock and a hard place problem here.
The kernel lockdown patches are not particularly popular with quite a few
kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds, which makes things that much
harder), but they are shipping.  That would seem to indicate that they
belong upstream or, at least, that <i>something</i> implementing that
functionality belongs upstream.

<p>
The annotations, themselves, are relatively
harmless (other than providing a bit of churn) and will allow Cox's module
parameter issue to be addressed. That will lead to a more secure kernel,
overall, 
with or without secure boot.  Once the relevant maintainers have
reviewed the patches (and those reviews are starting to trickle in), it
would seem that the patches should be merged (though Torvalds would need to
override Kroah-Hartman's NAK).  The 4.10 merge window will
be opening soon; it's likely too late for the annotation patches to make
that cut but, with luck, they could make it for 4.11.  The
larger (and more invasive in the eyes of some) lockdown patch set would
seem to have surmounted the known technical objections at that point;
whether that paves the way for those to be merged remains to be seen.

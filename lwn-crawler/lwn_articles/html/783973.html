It has been just over one full year since the WireGuard virtual private
network implementation was <a href="/Articles/748582/">reviewed here</a>.
WireGuard has advanced in a number of ways since that article was written;
it has gained many happy users, has been <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CA+55aFz5EWE9OTbzDoMfsY2ez04Qv9eg0KQhwKfyJY0vFvoD3g@mail.gmail.com/">endorsed
by Linus Torvalds</a>, and is now supported by tools like NetworkManager.
There is one notable thing that has <i>not</i> happened, though: WireGuard
has not yet been merged into the mainline kernel.  After a period of
silence, WireGuard is back, and it would appear that the long process of
getting upstream is nearly done.
<p>
A new version of the WireGuard patches was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190322071122.6677-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/">posted</a>
on March&nbsp;22.  WireGuard itself is not particularly controversial; few
people have raised complaints about its design or implementation.  The
sticking point is the <a href="/Articles/770750/">"Zinc" cryptographic
library</a> that WireGuard uses. 
Zinc was born out of frustration with the kernel's current cryptographic
layer, which is seen by many as being far too difficult to use.  Zinc is, in
essence, an entirely new cryptographic layer that sits alongside the
current code, duplicating a lot of functionality within the kernel but
providing an easier interface for cryptographic tasks.
<p>
There are a few complaints that have been heard about Zinc.  One of those
revolves around the fact that Zinc isn't just a new API for accessing
cryptographic algorithms; it also includes it own implementation of those
algorithms, duplicating functionality that the kernel already has.
WireGuard author Jason Donenfeld defends these new implementations,
probably correctly, as having been subjected to a higher level of
cryptographic review.  Kernel developers strongly dislike this kind of
duplication, though; they will argue that, if the new implementation of a
specific algorithm is better, it should simply replace the existing one
rather than duplicating it.  That way, there is only one version to
maintain, and all users will be able to take advantage of whatever benefits
it offers.
<p>
The duplicated algorithms have been a sticking point for some time, but it
would appear that a solution is in the works.  Crypto maintainer Herbert Xu
has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190322062740.nrwfx2rvmt7lzotj@gondor.apana.org.au/">a
version of Zinc</a> that introduces the new API, but which uses the
existing algorithm implementations rather than Donenfeld's new ones.  That
makes the API available for users 
like WireGuard while removing the new algorithm implementations from the
discussion for now.  Those implementations can, in the future, be evaluated
on their own merits and merged, one at a time, when a consensus emerges
that they are better.
<p>
Past discussions might lead one to expect that Donenfeld would resist this
move, but this time around he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHmME9pAgi=Li_C5xEq7EfmNq5p4BRc3rDxXjiz+xz0rSYikXA@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>:
"<q>I think we're slightly closer to being same page</q>".  He plans
to make some changes to Xu's version of Zinc, but the version he intends to
post will still use existing, in-kernel algorithms where they are
available.  Assuming that everybody likes the result, one of the major
long-term roadblocks to the merging of WireGuard will have been overcome.
<p>
Duplication of cryptographic functions is not the only complaint about
Zinc, though; others were <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu_mgyzqUCeb+wke--8Gn8YbjOb8jyrSgFr3-tcNP8ccEQ@mail.gmail.com/">expressed</a>
by Ard Biesheuvel, whose criticisms have done a fair amount to impede Zinc
in the past — but those criticisms have also resulted in numerous
improvements to the code.  Biesheuvel described Zinc as a "<q>layering
violation</q>", and complained that it is unable to use the asynchronous
algorithm implementations in the kernel.  That is by design: Zinc
explicitly only supports synchronous implementations (where the caller
waits until each operation is done).  Asynchronous implementations (which
run in parallel, often on an external accelerator, while the caller does
something else) are seen as too complex and providing too little benefit.
<p>
Biesheuvel disagrees with that view of asynchronous operations, and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAKv+Gu_NoKi3hhxw+S59Yu_c0R6fZh8+KW1XnyFWg74MxEixGA@mail.gmail.com/">fears</a>
that, in the future, somebody will  have to bolt asynchronous support onto
Zinc.  He would much rather see development effort going into fixing the
deficiencies in the existing cryptographic API.  He is not alone in this
view, but others disagree, including Torvalds, who <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wg2LJ5qQ0B2y+_6Ue62SBP4h9MLxLvn89bfcP7Cp2ac6A@mail.gmail.com/">declared</a>
himself to be strongly in the Zinc camp:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And honestly, I'm 1000% with Jason on this. The crypto/ model is
	hard to use, inefficient, and completely pointless when you know
	what your cipher or hash algorithm is, and your CPU just does it
	well directly.
</div>
<p>
He went on to say that "<q>none of the async accelerator code has ever
been worth anything on real hardware and on any sane and real
loads</q>"; see his message for the details on his reasoning.  If
asynchronous crypto accelerators lack value in the real world, then it
makes some sense to introduce an API that effectively ignores them.
Naturally, this view of asynchronous crypto devices is not universally
shared, or support for them would not exist in the kernel.  See, in
particular, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/AM5PR0901MB1155FD05113D6DC79A6274CED25E0@AM5PR0901MB1155.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com/">this
message</a> from Pascal Van Leeuwen for a rebuttal of some of Torvalds's
criticisms.  But it does seem clear that asynchronous crypto is not
particularly useful to a wide variety of use cases.
<p>
If the view expressed by Torvalds (and implicitly by Xu) wins out, and if
the next posting of Zinc adequately addresses the concerns regarding
duplicated algorithms, then Zinc's path into the mainline will start to
look relatively clear.  Unless some new problems arise with WireGuard
(which seems unlikely, since even those who are opposed to Zinc tend to be
supportive of WireGuard), it should be set to be merged as soon as Zinc
gets in.  That should bring a happy ending to the longish story of getting
WireGuard into the mainline, conceivably as soon as the 5.2 development
cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's fascinating to watch the constant ebb and flow between CPU and accelerators. We find running things on CPU to slow or too power consuming, and implement specialized accelerator HW to deal with. Then we find the specialized HW to limiting and cumbersome to use, and retreat back to doing things on the general purpose CPU. Only to repeat the cycle in future. <br>

Xilinx's solution solves what could be called the opposite problem by adding a CPU to an FPGA. The CPU is used for slow and complex sequential logic supporting the main function of the chip, which is implemented using the programmable logic. The idea is to save silicon area by including a hardwired CPU core instead of a syntehsized one.<br>

      <p>The hard CPU cores in FPGAs are typically ARM cores that don't have stellar performance (this is true even for Alterra/Intel).  Putting FPGA fabric in a high-performance CPU approaches the problem from the other direction and is quite interesting.

<p>I suspect, though, that any cool designs implemented in an FPGA will eventually migrate either to a hard core or into the CPU for performance reasons.  I think the FPGA fabric is mostly interesting as a prototyping solution.

I think that is complementary with the original idea, a CPU with FPGA could deploy arbitrary new hardware features, anything that becomes ubiquitous can be reimplemented in fixed logic in later CPUs, freeing up FPGA for new uses. You get to have feedback about which hardware features are actually practical to developers before having to work them into the fixed design.<br>
<p>
I don't know if that makes sense from the perspective of the chip real estate budget, would that area be better used for cache or something more mundane, would FPGA change the manufacturing cost?  It's an interesting idea anyway<br>

For the embedded market, it's usually the trifecta time-to-market/cost/power.<br>
<p>
Synthesizing an ARM processor this size would be really wasteful on an FPGA. I don't see anyone doing that in a product without a very strong reason (and a very good margin as well, to buffer the excess cost).<br>

Oh, and don't forget the programmable NICs with CPU + FPGA + RAM combos embedded.  What goes around...<br>

After reading the message from Van Leeuwen, I feel depressed.<br>
<p>
It's a shame I have to destroy all these Cavium Nitrox III cards.<br>
They're worth more as scrap since there's no software support for these CN35XX cards, only the Nitrox V CN55XX following them landing in linux5.<br>
Ironic that it's acidic Gold recovery for the Nitrox, and the PLX switch chips get safely reballed and resold off in china...<br>
<p>
*sigh*<br>

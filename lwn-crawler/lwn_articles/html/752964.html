</div>
Heterogeneous memory management (HMM) is a relatively new kernel subsystem
that allows the system to manage peripherals (such as graphics processors)
that have their own memory-management units.  In two sessions during the
memory-management track of the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, HMM creator Jérôme Glisse
provided an update on the status of this subsystem and where it is going,
along with a more detailed look at the memory-management unit (MMU)
notifiers mechanism on which it depends.
<p>
<h4>An HMM update</h4>
<p>
Glisse started by noting that <a href="/Articles/752966/">an RFC patch</a>
adding HMM support to the Nouveau driver (for NVIDIA graphics processors)
has been posted, with a second version coming soon.  He is hoping to
convert more GPU drivers to HMM in the near future; it is a better
solution, he said, than using <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> to pin user-space
pages into memory.  Beyond the advantage of not pinning pages, HMM can help
improve GPU performance by allowing the CPU to create a complex data
structure  using pointers that are valid in both CPU and GPU space.  The
CPU can then pass this structure to the GPU without having to recreate it
using GPU-space pointers.
<p>
There are also some vendors looking into using HMM to
manage device-private memory; AMD is likely to use HMM with its
next-generation hardware.
<p>
Glisse had a question for the group: he noticed that core dumps do not take
the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> lock before walking through (and dumping) user-space
memory.  That can lead to surprises when HMM is in use, since GPU threads
could be accessing this memory while it is being dumped.  Is this the
expected behavior?  Hugh Dickins said that he had run across that behavior
recently, and was "horrified" to see it.  Kirill Shutemov, though, said
that the expectation is that, by the time it comes to dumping core, there
will be no other users of the address space.  Process exit might have
similar issues, he thought, but Glisse said that the MMU
notifier calls will have caused any HMM devices to back off earlier in the exit
path.
<p>
Dickins said that everybody hates <tt>mmap_sem</tt> and is looking forward
to removing it.  That leads to a tendency to avoid taking it in situations
where it is thought that there will be no concurrent accesses anyway.  But
those are just the situations where there is no overhead to taking
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> in the first place.  Memory-management developers are
just being silly by trying to avoid taking it, he said; it just causes
surprises.  That part of the discussion ended with Glisse saying he would
post a patch adding <tt>mmap_sem</tt> to the core-dump path.
<p>
Glisse went on to say that he has a set of MMU-notifier patches pending.
In the process of writing them, he has noticed that a number of users of
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> are broken.  In particular, these users assume
that pages are fixed in place when they can, in fact, be swapped out from
underneath the device that is accessing them.  Files that are being
truncated are the most common case. 
If a file is truncated then extended again, a driver using
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> will continue using the old pages, while HMM
drivers using MMU notifiers will do the right thing.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox responded that nobody expects DMA to pages that have been
truncated to work, so there is no need to fix this behavior unless it is a
security problem.  Dan Williams agreed, saying that changing all of those
drivers to fix something that isn't really a problem does not seem
worthwhile.  But Glisse said that each driver does things differently, and
moving them to common code results in removing hundreds of lines from each
driver, so he is likely to persist.
<p>
As time ran out, a couple of other topics were raised briefly.  Glisse
would like to see a new DMA API that is designed to share mappings between
multiple I/O memory-management units.  There are also some issues around
migrating file-backed pages to a device.  This activity must be coordinated
with filesystems, and with the writeback activity in particular, since
these pages will become inaccessible to the GPU while the device is working
with them.
<p>
<h4>MMU notifiers</h4>
<p>
When the kernel makes changes to a process's address space, it is able to
keep the system's MMU in sync with those changes at the same time.  Things
get trickier, though, if one or more peripheral devices also have MMUs that
must be managed.  The answer is the "MMU notifier" mechanism, which allows
the HMM code to get a callback from the memory-management subsystem when
important changes are made.  But it turns out that some changes are more
important than others, so Glisse would like to adjust the MMU-notifier API
so that the HMM code can tell the difference.
<p>
An MMU notifier is called whenever one or more pages in the address space
of interest are invalidated, but the notifier is not given any
information about 
why this invalidation is happening.  To rectify that, he suggested adding a
new argument that would give the invalidation reason.  If the memory is
being unmapped entirely, for example, HMM will respond by freeing all of
its data structures associated with the memory range.  If the memory
protections are being changed, instead, there are no changes to the
physical pages, and thus no caching issues to deal with.  If a page's
physical address changes, mappings in the peripheral device must change as
well.  Some changes, such as clearing the soft-dirty bit, only affect the
host and don't require any response from HMM at all.  And so on.
<p>
In response to a question from Michal Hocko, Glisse said that the MMU
notifiers only fill an advisory role at the moment; they provide
information that the HMM subsystem can use.  In the future, the notifiers
might take significant actions, such as preempting the device, when
notifications arrive.
<p>
Dave Hansen worried that adding complexity to the notifiers will make it
harder for developers to know what to do when they make core
memory-management changes.  Under this scheme, it would become harder to
know which argument to pass to notifiers in new code; the fear of breaking
something in HMM would always be there.  That would make the
memory-management code harder to maintain.
Glisse said that the safe option
would be to indicate a full unmap when in doubt; it would lead to the worst
performance, but the results would be correct.
<p>
Hansen suggested splitting the suggested event types into a lower-level
event mask describing what is actually going on.  One bit would indicate a
physical address page, another that the virtual-memory area behind the page
is being removed, another for software-state changes, etc.  Glisse said
that this approach would be workable, though it would provide more
information than he really needs now.  The conversation went in circles for
some time on what the specific bits might be with no clear conclusion.  It
seems fairly clear that this patch will use the bitmask approach, though,
when it is posted in the future.
<p>
As things wound down, Andrew Morton noted that there had been <a
href="/Articles/732952/">some disagreements</a> in the past over whether
MMU notifiers are allowed to sleep.  He asked: has all of that been sorted
out?  Glisse responded that all notifiers are allowed to sleep at this
point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

No, because of vfork() or clone(CLONE_VM). It sounds like a potential security bug has just been announced.<br>

vfork() stops parent until child exits (or exec something) so we don't have concurrency here.<br>
<p>
CLONE_VM creates a thread. AFAICS all threads get ripped before dumping the core.<br>

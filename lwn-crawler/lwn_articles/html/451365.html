<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 12, 2011</br>
           </div>
The debate over the concept of "<a href="/Articles/448505/">user-friendly
disk names</a>" was rekindled this week with the posting of a new version
of Nao Nishijima's <a href="/Articles/450884/">persistent device names
patch</a>.  The disagreements over this particular feature remain; it is
possible that the change will be merged regardless.  At the core of this
discussion, though, is a concept which goes beyond adding a user-specified
name to specific devices; it's the bigger problem of getting structured
data out of the kernel.
<p>
After all these years, the main mechanism by which the kernel passes
information to user space remains the lowly <tt>printk()</tt> function.  It
is, needless to say, a useful and flexible way of getting messages out, but
it imposes almost nothing on the structure of those messages.  That leads
to all kinds of output like (from <tt>drivers/net/de620.c</tt>):
<p>
<pre>
    printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: Thanks, I feel much better now!\n", dev->name);
</pre>
<p>
or the famous message from <tt>drivers/char/lp.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    printk(KERN_INFO "lp%d on fire\n", minor);
</pre>
<p>
System administrators should not be faulted for wondering what they should
do in response to messages like these.
<p>
There have
been some changes to impose structure on <tt>printk()</tt> output,
starting with the addition of a marker for the severity level of each
message.  It still is not hard to find <tt>printk()</tt> calls without
severity levels, though; actually enforcing the use of these markers has
proved hard to do.  A bit more structure is added by <tt>dev_printk()</tt>
(and variants like <tt>dev_err()</tt>), but the use of these functions is
even less universal.
<p>
The lack of structure means that there is little consistency between
messages; any two network drivers will almost certainly print different
things to indicate the same situation.  Kernel messages can also vary over
time; messages emitted by <tt>printk()</tt> are also not normally seen as
part of the kernel ABI, despite the fact that changing them can break
scripts that try to extract useful information from the system logs.  
So it's not surprising that, about one year ago, Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/392177/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The kernel's whole approach to messaging is pretty haphazard and
	lame and sad.  There have been various proposals to improve the
	usefulness and to rationally categorise things in way which are
	more useful to operators, but nothing seems to ever get over the
	line.
</div>
<p>
Various people have tried to improve the situation in spots; the
user-friendly disk names, by trying to attach a consistent name to devices,
is one such attempt.  The <a href="/Articles/419845/">netoops patch</a>
from Google is another; it helps Google figure out why machines are
crashing without requiring operators to actually dig through the logs.  But
these changes are far from an overall framework for structured data from
the kernel.
<p>
There have been a few attempts to make such frameworks over the years; all
have fallen far short of making it into the kernel.  It's not hard to come
up with plausible reasons for this failure.  The amount of work
required is huge, especially if one wants to add structure to the bulk of
interesting communications from kernel space.  Developers like
<tt>printk()</tt>; they are less likely to be enamored of some other
interface which requires more work to use, is less flexible (by design) in
its output, and which may well have to sit alongside the existing
<tt>printk()</tt> logging.  Coming up with a structured format which meets
everybody's needs - and which will not have to be supplemented with a
"version&nbsp;2" format in the coming years - presents its own challenges.
<p>
It must also be said that kernel developers, as a whole, see little value
in standardized, structured kernel logging information.  It will not help
them to debug their kernels.  The fact that a lot of users want this sort
of feature is far from irrelevant to the development community, but
experience has shown that a lack of developer interest can make it much
harder to get changes merged - especially if those changes are wide-ranging
and disruptive.
<p>
If this problem is ever to be solved, it would seem that two things need to
be found: a mechanism which looks like it could work and a motivation for
kernel developers to accept it.  The motivation can probably found in a
combination of (1)&nbsp;their paychecks as customers continue to push for
this capability and (2)&nbsp;the prospect of a continuing stream of <i>ad
hoc</i> patches adding structure to various corners without solving the
real problem.  But that leaves open the problem of finding a workable
solution.
<p>
Your editor has a half-baked thought on this matter based on the
realization that the kernel already has a nice mechanism for passing
structured data to user space.  On almost any contemporary system, the
<tt>/dev</tt> directory is managed by the <tt>udev</tt> daemon;
<tt>udev</tt> works by receiving highly-structured messages from the kernel
describing the coming and going of devices, changes in their configuration,
firmware load requests, and more.  It is an established protocol which
enables sophisticated user-space responses to kernel events.  Udev and the
associated "uevent" mechanism had some early growing pains, but this code
is now stable, functional, and almost universally used.  Perhaps it's time
for this mechanism to take on some new duties.
<p>
Uevents work because the format is simultaneously structured and flexible;
it can be extended when the need arises.  The generation of events is
almost entirely done automatically by the driver core; most driver authors
need not do anything to cause them to happen and, indeed, may not even know
that this mechanism is operating underneath the hood.  Driver authors don't
have to make their own events; they would have to go out of their way to
prevent them from happening.
<p>
Logging of other types of events will probably require explicit support
in the relevant kernel code; that is the part needing some extra thought.
The creation of uevents by hand is a bit of a 
labor-intensive business; the relevant code tends to look like:
<p>
<pre>
	retval = add_uevent_var(env, "ACTION=%s", action_string);
	if (retval)
		goto exit;
	retval = add_uevent_var(env, "DEVPATH=%s", devpath);
	if (retval)
		goto exit;
	retval = add_uevent_var(env, "SUBSYSTEM=%s", subsystem);
	if (retval)
		goto exit;
</pre>
<p>
Clearly, any attempt to place this kind of code in every logging location
is not going to get very far.  What is needed is a useful set of helper
functions.  These functions, for maximum utility, would probably be tied
fairly tightly to the underlying subsystems.  Storage drivers could have
functions to report block errors, device changes, and multipath
connectivity changes.  Network drivers would need to report events like
carrier loss, excessive checksum errors, or duplicate MAC addresses.  All
kernel code could benefit from helpers to log allocation failures or failed
assertions.  In each case, the helper would standardize the format of the
reported information while allowing the addition of information specific to
the call site.
<p>
The addition of a new set of logging functions would necessarily require
changes to drivers to use those functions.  So it would take time to achieve
anything close to comprehensive coverage, and 100% coverage would never
happen.  But, then, we still don't have 100% coverage for the KERN_*
severity markers.  If this interface proved useful, one could imagine that
the code paths of interest to enterprise distribution customers would be
covered in relatively short order.
<p>
But, then, there are probably several things fatally wrong with this idea;
the structured logging problem will likely remain unsolved for some time
yet.  But the problem will not go away; if anything, the need to recognize
and automatically respond to system events will only increase.  Someday
somebody will come up with a solution that works and that can be adopted
with minimal pain; until then, <tt>printk()</tt> remains the only show in
town.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

"Network drivers would need to report events like carrier loss, excessive checksum errors, or duplicate MAC addresses. "<br>
<p>
these kinds of things are actually available as highly structured (if somewhat underdocumented) rtnetlink(7) messages. i would argue that netlink is a more natural fit for this kind of data.<br>
<p>
system logs structured or otherwise need both a degree of persistence (for review and forensics) and immediacy (for booting, lockups, and issues to which one would like to immediately respond). the latter suggests a requirement of display; any infrastructure would thus be at best a strict superset of current logging, and thus add complexity to an area where robustness is a if not the primary concern. of course, it also implies that old techniques can be used as fallback, or prior to initialization...<br>

There is quite a bit of work on generating structured logs to enable more effective diagnosis of system states, particularly, faults and failures.  Readers of this article may be interested in the rationalization of kernel log messages reported in <br>
<p>
J. Hammond, T. Minyard and J. Browne End-to-end framework for fault management for open source clusters: Ranger Proceedings of the 2010 TeraGrid Conference<br>
<p>
The remaining major obstacle to effective diagnostic use of system logs, once the kernel logging is rationalized as in the article cited above, is the fact that most software subsystem log are ad hoc and incomplete.<br>

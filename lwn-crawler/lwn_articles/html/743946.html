Linux’s deadline scheduler is a global early deadline first scheduler for
sporadic tasks with constrained deadlines.  These terms were defined in <a
href="/Articles/743740/">the first part of this series</a>.  In this
installment, the details of the Linux deadline scheduler and how it can be
used will be examined.
<p>

The deadline scheduler prioritizes the tasks according to the task’s job
deadline: the earliest absolute deadline first. For a system with <i>M</i>
processors, the <i>M</i> earliest deadline jobs will be selected to run on
the <i>M</i>
processors.
<p>

The Linux deadline scheduler also
implements the constant bandwidth server (CBS) algorithm, which is a
resource-reservation protocol.  CBS is used to guarantee that each task
will receive its full run time during every period.  At every
activation of a task, the CBS replenishes the task’s run time. As the job
runs, it consumes that time; if the task runs out, it will be
throttled and descheduled. In this case, the task will be able to
run only after the next replenishment at the beginning of the next
period. Therefore, CBS is used to both guarantee each task’s CPU time
based on its timing requirements and to prevent a misbehaving task from running
for more than its run time and causing problems to other jobs.
<p>

In order to avoid overloading the system with deadline tasks, the
deadline scheduler implements an acceptance test, which is
done every time a task is configured to run with the deadline
scheduler. This test guarantees that deadline tasks will not
use more than the maximum amount of the system's CPU time, which is
specified using the <tt>kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us</tt> and 
<tt>kernel.sched_rt_period_us</tt> sysctl knobs.
The default values are 950000 and 1000000, respectively, limiting realtime
tasks to 950,000µs of CPU time every 1s of wall-clock time.
For a single-core system, this test is both necessary and sufficient. It
means that the 
acceptance of a task guarantees that the task will be able to use all the
run time allocated to it before its deadline.
<p>
However, it is worth 
noting that this acceptance test is necessary, but <i>not</i> sufficient,
for global
scheduling on multiprocessor systems. As Dhall’s effect
(described in the first part of this series) shows, the
global deadline scheduler acceptance task is unable to schedule the task
set even though there is CPU time available.
Hence, the current acceptance test does not guarantee that,
once accepted, the tasks will be able to use all the assigned run time
before their deadlines. The best the current acceptance task can guarantee is
bounded tardiness, which is a good guarantee for soft real-time systems. If
the user wants to guarantee that all tasks will meet their deadlines, the
user has to either use a partitioned approach or to use a necessary and
sufficient acceptance test, defined by:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Σ(WCETi / Pi) &lt;= M - (M - 1) x Umax
</blockquote>
<p>
Or, expressed in words: the sum of the run time/period of each task should
be less than or 
equal to the number of processors, minus the largest utilization multiplied
by the number of processors minus one.
 It turns out that, the
bigger Umax is, the less load the system is able to handle.
<p>

In the presence of tasks with a big utilization, one good strategy is to
partition the system and isolate some high-load tasks in a way that allows
the small-utilization tasks to be globally scheduled on a different set of
CPUs. Currently, the deadline scheduler 
does not enable the user to set the affinity of a thread, but it is
possible to partition a system using control-group cpusets.
<p>
For example, consider a system with eight CPUs.   One big task has a
utilization close to
90% of one CPU, while a set of many other tasks have a lower
utilization. In this 
environment, one recommended setup would be to isolate CPU0 to run the
high-utilization task while allowing the other tasks to run in the
remaining CPUs.
To configure this environment, the user must follow the following
steps:
<p>
<ol class="spacylist">
<li> Enter in the cpuset directory and create two cpusets:
<p>
<pre>
    # cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/
    # mkdir cluster
    # mkdir partition
</pre>

<li> Disable load balancing in the root cpuset to create two new root
domains in the CPU sets:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 0 &gt; cpuset.sched_load_balance
</pre>

<li> Enter the directory for the cluster cpuset, set the CPUs available to
     1-7, the memory node the set should run in (in this case the system
     is not NUMA, 
     so it is always node zero), and set the cpuset to the exclusive mode.
<p>
<pre>
    # cd cluster/
    # echo 1-7 &gt; cpuset.cpus
    # echo 0 &gt; cpuset.mems
    # echo 1 &gt; cpuset.cpu_exclusive 
</pre>
<p>
<li> Move all tasks to this CPU set
<p>
<pre>
    # ps -eLo lwp | while read thread; do echo $thread &gt; tasks ; done
</pre>

<li> Then it is possible to start deadline tasks in this cpuset.

<li> Configure the partition cpuset:
<p>
<pre>
    # cd ../partition/
    # echo 1 &gt; cpuset.cpu_exclusive 
    # echo 0 &gt; cpuset.mems 
    # echo 0 &gt; cpuset.cpus
</pre>

<li> Finally move the shell to the partition cpuset.
<p>
<pre>
    # echo $$ &gt; tasks 
</pre>
<li> The final step is to run the deadline workload.
</ol>
<p>
With this setup, the task isolated in the partitioned cpuset will not
interfere with the tasks in the cluster cpuset, increasing the
system’s maximum load while meeting the deadline of real-time tasks.
<p>

<h4>The developer’s perspective</h4>
<p>

There are three ways to use the deadline scheduler:
as constant bandwidth server,
as a periodic/sporadic server waiting for an event, or
with a periodic task waiting for replenishment.
The most basic parameter for the sched deadline is the period, which
defines how often a task is activated. When a task does not have an
activation pattern, it is possible to use the deadline scheduler
in an aperiodic mode by using only the CBS features.
<p>

In the aperiodic case, the best thing the user can do is to estimate how
much CPU time a task needs in a given period of time to accomplish the
expected result. For instance, if one task needs 200ms each second to
accomplish its work, run time would be 200,000,000ns and the
period would be 1,000,000,000ns. The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html"><tt>sched_setattr()</tt></a>
system call is used to set the 
deadline-scheduling parameters. The following code is a simple example of
how to set the mentioned parameters in an application:
<p>
<pre>

    int main (int argc, char **argv)
    {
        int ret;
        int flags = 0;
        struct sched_attr attr;

        memset(&amp;attr, 0, sizeof(attr)); 
        attr.size = sizeof(attr);

        /* This creates a 200ms / 1s reservation */
        attr.sched_policy   = SCHED_DEADLINE;
        attr.sched_runtime  =  200000000;
        attr.sched_deadline = attr.sched_period = 1000000000;

        ret = sched_setattr(0, &amp;attr, flags);
        if (ret &lt; 0) {
            perror("sched_setattr failed to set the priorities");
            exit(-1);
        }

        do_the_computation_without_blocking();
        exit(0);
}
</pre>
<p>

In the aperiodic case, the task does not need to know when a period starts,
and so the task just needs to run, knowing that the scheduler will throttle
the task after it has consumed the specified run time.
<p>

Another use case is to implement a periodic task which starts to run at
every periodic run-time replenishment, runs until it finishes its processing,
then goes to sleep until the next activation. Using the parameters from the
previous example, the following code sample uses the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_yield.2.html"><tt>sched_yield()</tt></a>
system 
call to notify the scheduler of end of the current activation.  The task
will be awakened by the next run-time replenishment.  Note that the
semantics of <tt>sched_yield()</tt> are a bit different for deadline tasks;
they will not be scheduled again until the run-time replenishment happens.
<p>
Code working in this mode would look like the example above, except that
the actual computation looks like:
<pre>
        for(;;) {
            do_the_computation();
            /* 
	     * Notify the scheduler the end of the computation
             * This syscall will block until the next replenishment
             */
	    sched_yield();
        }        
</pre>
<p>

It is worth noting that the computation must  finish within the given
run time. If the task does not finish, it will be throttled by the CBS
algorithm.
<p>
The most common realtime use case for the realtime task is to wait for
an external event to take place. In this case, the task waits in a blocking
system call. This system call will wake up the real-time task with, at
least, a minimum interval between each activation. That is, it is a sporadic
task. Once activated, the task will do the computation and provide the
response.  Once the task provides the output, the task goes to sleep by
blocking waiting for the next event.
<p>
<pre>
        for(;;) {
            /* 
	     * Block in a blocking system call waiting for a data
             * to be processed.
             */
            process_the_data();
            produce_the_result()
	    block_waiting_for_the_next_event();
        }
</pre>
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
The deadline scheduler is able to provide guarantees for realtime tasks
based only in the task’s timing constraints. Although global
multi-core scheduling faces Dhall’s effect, it is possible to configure the
system to achieve a high load utilization using cpusets as a method to
partition the systems. Developers can also benefit from the deadline
scheduler by designing their application to interact with the
scheduler, simplifying the control of the timing behavior of the task.
<p>
The deadline scheduler tasks have a higher priority than realtime scheduler
tasks. That means that even the highest fixed-priority task will be delayed
by deadline tasks. Thus, deadline tasks do not need to consider 
interference from realtime tasks, but realtime tasks must consider
interference from deadline tasks.
<p>

The deadline scheduler and the PREEMPT_RT patch play different roles in
improving Linux’s realtime features. While the deadline scheduler allows
scheduling tasks in a more predictable way, the PREEMPT_RT patch set
improves the 
kernel by reducing and limiting the amount of time a lower-priority task
can delay the execution of a realtime task.
It works by reducing the amount of the
time a processor runs with preemption and IRQs disabled
and the amount of time in which a
lower-priority task can delay the execution of a task by holding a lock.
<p>
For example, as a realtime task can suffer an activation latency higher
than 5ms when running in a non-realtime kernel, it is 
that this kernel cannot handle deadline tasks
with deadlines shorter than 5ms. In contrast, the realtime
kernel provides a guarantee, on well tuned and certified hardware, of not
delaying the start of the highest priority task by more than 150µs, thus it
is possible to handle realtime tasks with deadlines much shorter than 5ms.

Hi,<br>
<p>
This is all quite an interesting reading for embedded systems guy like me :-)<br>
Well appreciated!<br>
<p>
I just would like to emphasize more the RT patches, because the people behind it<br>
deserve a big credit.<br>
<p>
It's true what you wrote about RT preventing lower tasks from (sigh) preventing<br>
higher priority tasks from running when they need to. But the real cool and hardest<br>
thing in all the RT patches is making the kernel as lock-less and as preemptible<br>
as possible, including all the drivers. And all the crazy possible code paths you can<br>
only imagine ;-)<br>
<p>

Hi,<br>
<p>
great article! Convinced me to subscribe!<br>
<p>
I wanted to test this.<br>
But setting the SCHED_DEADLINE policy with sched_setattr() fails with an operation not permitted error.<br>
SCHED_RR works fine this way.<br>

I found the problem. For anyone having a hard time with this too.<br>
First of all manpages are your friend. Read the error description.<br>
<p>
I had overlooked the second note on EPERM.<br>
It says that all CPUs have to be available to the scheduler ( e.g. sched_setaffinity ). Otherwise it fails with EPERM.<br>

Hope this helps.<br>

In add to Dhall effect, pitfalls related to critical sections should be mentioned. A task with a close deadline may be blocked with a task with more distant deadline. Unfortunately, shared resources are everywhere in modern OS and tasks inter-blocking latencies are difficult to evaluate (especially with dynamic priority schedulers).<br>

It's not clear how to calculate deadline parameters for threads of a daw running for example at 44000/16bit. Its parent process creates multiple threads: an audio thread running at fifo 99 (defined manually in preferences), a lot of threads each of which is created for each audio plugin loaded with fifo 1, one midi and one video thread with nonrt prio 20. Since daw is very cpu intensive, the common approach is to run all those threads on all cpus but one left for housekeeping. Will there be benefit to use deadline scheduler for all threads except audio thread which priority in any case will be reset to that set in preferences? It would be interesting to experiment with that if i knew how to calculate parameters for the command. The buffer for audio thread is set at 16/3 which equals to latency of 1 ms<br>

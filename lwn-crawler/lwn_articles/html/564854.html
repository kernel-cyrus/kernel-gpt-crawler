<p>
Lightweight virtualization using containers is a technique that has finally 
come together for Linux, though there are still some rough edges that may
need filing down. Containers are created by using two
separate 
kernel features: control groups (cgroups) and namespaces.  Cgroups are in the process of <a
href="/Articles/484251/">being revamped</a>, while there may still need to
be more namespaces added to the
<a href="/Articles/531114/">varieties currently
available</a>. For example, there is no way to separate most devices into their own
namespace.  That's a hole that Oren Laadan would like to see filled, so he put
out an <a href="/Articles/564977/">RFC
on device namespaces</a> recently.
</p>

<p>
Namespaces partition global system resources so that different sets of
processes have their own view of those resources.  For example, mount
namespaces partition the mounted filesystems into different views, with the
result that processes in one namespace are unable to see or interact with
filesystems that are only mounted in another.  Similarly, <a
href="/Articles/531419/">PID 
namespaces</a> give each namespace its own set of process IDs (PIDs).
Certain devices are currently handled by their own namespace or similar
functionality: network namespaces for network devices and the
<tt>devpts</tt> pseudo-filesystem for pseudo-terminals (i.e. pty).  But there
is no way to partition the view of all devices in the system, which is what
<a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/wiki/DeviceNamespace">device
namespaces</a> would do.
</p>

<p>
The motivation for the feature is to allow multiple virtual phones on a
single physical phone.  For example, one could have two complete Android
systems running on the phone, with one slated for work purposes, and the
other for personal uses.  Each system would run in its own container that
would be isolated from the other.  That isolation would allow companies to
control the apps and security of the "company half" of a phone, while
allowing the user to keep their personal information separate.  A <a
href="http://vimeo.com/60113683">video</a> gives an overview of the
idea. Much of that separation can be done today, but 
there is a missing piece: virtualizing the devices (e.g. frame buffer,
touchscreen, buttons).
</p>

<p>
The proposal adds the concept of an "active" device namespace,
which is 
the one that the user is currently interacting with.  The upshot is that a
user could switch between the phone personalities (or personas) as easily
as they switch between apps today.  Each personality would have access to
all of the capabilities of the phone while it was the active namespace, but
none while it was the inactive (or background) namespace.  
</p>

<p>
Setting up a device namespace is done in the <a
href="/Articles/531381/">normal way</a>, using the <tt>clone()</tt>,
<tt>setns()</tt>, or <tt>unshare()</tt> system
calls. One surprise is that there is no new <tt>CLONE_*</tt> flag added for
device namespaces, and the <tt>CLONE_NEWPID</tt> flag is overloaded.  A
comment in the <a href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/blob/master/dev_ns__introduce_device_namespaces#L419">code</a> explains why:
<pre>
    /*
     * Couple device namespace semantics with pid-namespace.
     * It's convenient, and we ran out of clone flags anyway.
     */
</pre>
While coupling PID and device namespaces may work, it does seem like some
kind of long-term solution to the clone flag problem is required.  Once a
process has been put into a device namespace, any <tt>open()</tt> of a
namespace-aware device will restrict that device to the namespace.

<p>
At some level, adding device namespaces is simply a matter of virtualizing
the major and minor 
device numbers so that each namespace has its own set of them.  The
major/minor numbers in a namespace would correspond to the driver loaded
for that 
namespace. Drivers that might be available to multiple namespaces would need
to be changed to be namespace-aware.  For some kinds of drivers, for
example those 
without any real state (e.g. for Android, the <a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/blob/master/dev_ns__adopt_the_led_subsystem">LED
subsystem</a> or the <a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/blob/master/dev_ns__adopt_the_backlight-lcd_subsystem">backlight/LCD
subsystem</a>), the changes would be minimal—essentially just a test.  If
the namespace that contains the device is the active one, proceed,
otherwise, ignore any requested
changes.

<p>
Devices, though, are sometimes stateful.  One can't
suddenly switch sending frame buffer data mid-stream (or mix two streams)
and expect the screen 
contents to stay coherent.  So, drivers and subsystems will need to handle
the switching behavior.  For example, the 
framebuffer device should only reflect changes to the screen from the
active namespace, but it should buffer changes from the background
namespace so that those changes will be reflected in the display after a
switch. 
</p>

<p>
Laadan and his colleagues at <a href="http://www.cellrox.com/">Cellrox</a>
have put together a <a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/wiki/DeviceNamespace%3APatches">set
of patches</a> based on the 3.4 kernel for the Android emulator (goldfish).
There is also a fairly detailed description of the patches and the changes
made for both stateless and stateful devices.  An
<a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-demo">Android-based
demo</a> that switches between a running phone and an app that displays a
changing color palette has also been created.
</p>

<p>
So far, there hasn't been much in the way of discussion of the idea on the
containers and lxc-devel mailing lists that the RFC was posted to. On one
hand, it makes sense to be able to virtualize all of the devices in a
system, but on the other that means there are a <i>lot</i> of drivers that
might need to change.  There may be some "routing" issues to resolve, as
well—when the phone rings, which namespace handles it? The existing
proof-of-concept API for switching the 
active namespace would also likely need some work.  

<p>
While it may be a
worthwhile feature, it could also lead to a large ripple effect of driver changes. How device namespaces
fare in terms of moving toward the 
mainline may well hinge on others stepping forward with additional use
cases.  In the end, though, the <a
href="https://github.com/Cellrox/devns-patches/blob/master/dev_ns__introduce_device_namespaces">core
changes</a> to support the feature are fairly small, so the phone
personality use case might be enough all on its own.

Can there only be one active device namespace at a time? That's probably sufficient for android but seems to ignore multi-seat systems entirely.<br>
<p>
I could easily imagine that for example a shared server has N of the same pci devices (e.g. graphic cards), each of which is allocated to a single user (out of N users) which may be connected at the same time though remote desktop.<br>

The current patch set supports a single active device namespace, which serves the use case of virtual phone, but the extension to N active device namespaces would be natural, should there be use cases that require it.<br>
<p>
One of the main reasons that we posted our work is to hear from other people on their use cases, so we can cover those cases in our future releases.<br>
<p>
Are you aware of any active projects that can make use of N active device namespaces if that code would be posted?<br>

      <a href="http://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/sane-session-switching/">This article</a> discusses recent multiseat device plans.  Instead of device namespaces they will not allow any sessions to directly open devices.  Instead, the devices will be opened in systemd and the FD passed to the session.  To me this seems like a much better solution than device namespaces, since the userspace daemon (systemd in this case) can have device specific knowledge about how to idle one FD and enable another so that the device switches between sessions.  With device namespaces all this must be stuck into the kernel for every driver.

Very good article!<br>
We see device namespace as complementary to existing solutions which apply restrictions to device access.<br>
<p>
It really depends on the use case, whether restricting device access is sufficient or if a certain device needs to be virtualized.<br>
For example, in the use case discussed in the article, graphic-servers of all sessions need to either cooperate with logind (by acknowledging the switch) or gracefully handle EACCESS errors while in an inactive session.<br>

           <p>April 21, 2023</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Florian Fainelli</p>
           </div>
The concept of movable memory was initially designed for hot-pluggable
memory on server-class systems, but it would now appear that this mechanism
is finding a new use in consumer-electronics devices as well.  The
designated movable block patch set was first <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20220913195508.3511038-1-opendmb@gmail.com/">submitted</a>
by Doug Berger in September 2022.  By adding more flexibility around the
configuration and use of movable memory, this work will, it is hoped, improve how
Linux performs on resource-constrained systems.

<p>
The motivation for these patches stems from the need to support large,
contiguous allocations (2MB or more) for audio and video device drivers on
hardware that lacks an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_memory_management_unit">IOMMU</a>
and may have a small amount (1-2GB) of memory. These devices are
commonly found as set-top boxes running a variety of Linux-based software
environments from <a href="https://rdkcentral.com/">RDK</a> and <a
href="https://www.android.com/tv/">Android TV</a> to entirely custom
software stacks.
<p>
One of the most prominent SoC vendors in the set-top-box product space is
Broadcom, whose systems have been designed with a custom DRAM controller
implementing a complex arbitration scheme between DRAM
clients that is intended to provide strong
quality-of-service guarantees with no video pixels lost. In such a system,
the CPU, GPU, video decoder, and audio decoder are all clients of the DRAM
controller, each with its own priority and servicing needs. The video
decoder and display clients need realtime access to DRAM, while the CPU and
GPU can be given round-robin access to the remaining bandwidth.
<p>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2023/dmb-figure-1.svg" altl="[memory-map
	example]" width=200 class="photo" align="right" hspace=3>

In order to continue to satisfy the need for higher video resolution, DRAM
bandwidth must also increase while keeping the overall system cost
down. One way to offer more DRAM bandwidth is to add DRAM controllers, each
managing a set of the DRAM chips in the system, as shown to the right.
This approach naturally fits into the DRAM controller's arbitration
mechanism; it would allow for the CPU to be granted bandwidth with equal
priority across the multiple DRAM controllers, while allowing each video
decoder to be attached to its own controller. The decoder handling the main
picture could be attached to one controller, while the decoder handling
picture-in-picture would be attached to the other.
<p>
This scheme will only work, though, if each decoder is accessing memory
attached to the correct controller.  The first challenge, thus, consists of
having the kernel ensure that the physical memory pages that are allocated to
these video decoders come from separate memory controllers so
that clients can be split across the available DRAM space. The second
challenge is to hand <i>large</i> (several hundreds of MBs) chunks of physically
contiguous memory to these video decoders.
<p>

One possibility would be to use device-private <a
href="/Articles/486301/">CMA</a> areas, declared in the devicetree, to
solve this problem.  Alternatively, as was done for many years in
vendor-provided kernels, a fixed carve-out region, with
memory held as "reserved" from the kernel, could solve the problem. The
difficulty with these approaches, however, is the lack of memory-sharing
opportunities between the kernel and the constituents it serves, which are
mostly user-space applications.
<p>
With a fixed carve-out and the memory held in reserve, we are guaranteed
that the memory needed by the video decoders will be available, but at the
cost of configuring the system with the worst-case scenario in mind. While
this approach is functional, given large amounts of DRAM, it does not allow
the kernel to dynamically re-utilize that memory, wasting
memory that could be used when video is not being displayed
on the screen.
<p>
CMA does provide for some sharing opportunities, but CMA prioritizes the
kernel driver tied to the CMA region in order to ensure that the memory
will be available when the driver needs it. While various attempts have
been made to improve the way CMA holds onto memory and how its
heuristics work, many years of field testing eventually proved these
approaches inadequate given the large amounts of memory needed (sometimes
over half of the total DRAM size).  This resulted in performance problems
stemming from the kernel continuously moving memory around to
service both user-space allocations and kernel-driver needs.
<p>
An ideal solution would provide a truly uniform memory architecture for all
DRAM clients and lift the need for large contiguous memory allocations,
utilizing IOMMUs to assemble individual pages into a contiguous virtual
address space for the devices. This is typically how other SoC vendors have
designed their systems; that is, however, not the case for the hardware
under discussion here.  Now that the <a
href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image">Android
Generic Kernel Image (GKI)</a> is being mandated for Android TV, the need
for a generic solution has become more pressing.
<p>
<h4>Designated movable blocks</h4>
<p>
The designated movable block patch set is an attempt at solving these
problems while modifying as little code as possible, in order to maximize
the chances of being included in the Android kernel built for GKI.  The
patch set builds upon a number of existing kernel features that are
currently only accessible in systems making use of NUMA and <a
href="https://wiki.osdev.org/SRAT">ACPI System Resource Affinity Tables</a>
describing hot-pluggable memory, which are not present on the set-top-box
devices.
<p>
A designated movable block is a range of memory, of arbitrary size, that has
been designated by the system administrator as containing only 
movable memory. These blocks can be defined using the <tt>movablecore</tt>
command-line parameter; other approaches such as <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20220913195508.3511038-17-opendmb@gmail.com/">devicetree
reserved regions</a> may be possible as well.  By carefully placing
designated movable blocks in the range covered by each DRAM controller, a
system designer should be able to create memory regions that will be
available to device drivers when needed, but which are also usable for
other purposes the rest of the time.

<p>
The kernel has long had the concept of zones, which are used to partition
memory, usually to be able to handle addressing limitations. For instance
<tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> and <tt>ZONE_DMA32</tt> exist to provide memory for
peripherals that can only perform DMA to a portion of the physical address
space. One of the special zones added to support hot-pluggable memory
was <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>, which is intended to contain only (or mostly)
movable allocations.  The kernel will typically place user-space allocations
within <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>, since they can be moved without user space
noticing.  The kernel will also try hard not to put pinned or unmovable
memory there, so the zone really contains mostly movable memory most of the
time.
<p>
The kernel creates zones in a monotonically increasing fashion, so the
zones defined in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/mmzone.h#L610"><tt>zone_type</tt>
enum</a> will be created (when applicable) in ascending address
order.  Thus, for example, <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> will be placed lower than
<tt>ZONE_DMA32</tt> which, in turn, sits below <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>.
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> is normally the highest of the general memory zones. 
In set-top-box systems with multiple memory controllers, letting the kernel
populate zones in this order will lead to an
imbalance of memory zones across the memory controllers. If, for example, any
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> memory is located on DRAM-0, then all of DRAM-1 must
be <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> and, conversely, if any <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt> memory is
located on DRAM-1, then no <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> memory can be located on
DRAM-0. This is shown below:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2023/dmb-figure-2.svg" altl="[memory-map
	example]" width=400 class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
This results in customers not being happy that they cannot utilize the full
DRAM bandwidth available for their applications. 
In order to achieve a precise and satisfactory placement of such zones, the
<tt>movablecore</tt> command line parameter was enhanced to support the
<tt>&lt;amount&gt;@&lt;address&gt;</tt> notation, thus allowing the desired
interleaving of zones to be created:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2023/dmb-figure-3.svg" altl="[memory-map
	example]" width=400 class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
Berger <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/f48ca859-c65e-9b2d-2d33-b86edc77cebd@gmail.com/">indicated</a>
that using the <tt>page_alloc.shuffle=1</tt> command-line argument to
spread the pages across the available DRAM space, ensuring that zones are
defined more evenly between memory controllers as shown above, resulted in
a 20% speed increase for a simple synthetic benchmark.

<p>
A second focus of the patch set is the fixed carve-outs required to meet
the worst-case memory requirements of multimedia device drivers.  By
default, reserved memory is unavailable for other uses.  However, if the
<tt>reusable</tt> devicetree property is defined for the reserved memory,
the operating system can use that memory with the limitation that the
device driver owning the region must be able to reclaim it. Unfortunately,
no mechanism currently exists in Linux, other than CMA, to provide a
general implementation of reusable reserved memory so its benefits have not
been realized.
<p>
Creating a designated movable block for such reusable, reserved memory
would allow the kernel to move any data contained in the region when the
pages are reclaimed by a device driver.  The driver for which the memory
was reserved would be able to claim it when needed, and the kernel would
move other users as needed to satisfy the allocation; when the driver no
longer needed the memory, it could be returned for other uses.
The memory footprint of multimedia drivers tends to only change during
transitions in modes of operation where the increased latency of migrating page
data can be tolerated.
<p>
For now, though, the implementation of this functionality has been dropped
to focus on the <tt>movablecore</tt> changes, which are an important first
step.
<p>
<h4>Discussion and future</h4>
<p>
David Hildenbrand <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/0c4e35de-f790-5399-c812-ff90a4ab7531@redhat.com/">saw
the patch set</a> as being intrusive:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	As raised, I'd appreciate if less intrusive alternatives could be
	evaluated (e.g., fake NUMA nodes and being able to just use mbind(),
	moving such memory to ZONE_MOVABLE after boot via something like daxctl).
<p>
	I'm not convinced that these intrusive changes are worth it at this
	point. Further, some of the assumptions (ZONE_MOVABLE == user space) are
	not really future proof as I raised.
</blockquote>
<p>
He suggested that systems with multiple memory controllers should just be
treated as if they were NUMA systems, which would allow separate NUMA nodes
to represent each memory controller. While this idea is appealing, the
systems described are not properly NUMA; each of the CPU cores is treated
uniformly in terms of memory accesses.  It is only a subset of
peripherals within the system that are required to be split between memory
controllers for better DRAM efficiency.
<p>
Perhaps more importantly, using NUMA would not work with Android, which
does not configure the GKI for NUMA support.  The GKI maintainers would
either need to enable <tt>CONFIG_NUMA</tt> for all devices, which would be
a waste of memory and resources for most other SoC vendors, or it would
become necessary to ship a non-NUMA GKI kernel image alongside a NUMA GKI
kernel image, thus partially defeating the purpose of GKI.
<p>
There were some clarifications <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cbf408b3-82e8-79fe-0998-f4aed7117c95@redhat.com/">provided</a>
by Hildenbrand as to what goes into <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Let me clarify what ZONE_MOVABLE can and cannot do:
<p>
	<ul>
	<li> We cannot assume that specific user space allocations are served from
	  it, neither can we really modify behavior.
	<li> We cannot assume that user space allocations won't be migrated off
	  that zone to another zone.
	<li> We cannot assume that no other (kernel) allocations will end up on it.
	<li> We cannot make specific processes preferably consume memory
	from it.
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Designing a feature that relies on any of these assumptions would be wrong.
However, the intent is to not force or guarantee that applications will
obtain their memory from <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> but, rather, to exploit the
nice properties of that zone as containing movable memory.
<p>
The patch set is intended to allow people who are currently unhappy
with the <tt>MIGRATE_CMA</tt> migration type and associated heuristics to
define their device-private CMA regions (<tt>shared-dma-pool</tt> in the
devicetree) as falling within a designated movable block and, thus, utilize
the <tt>MIGRATE_MOVABLE</tt> heuristics instead. No one has volunteered to
try that yet however.
<p>
Mel Gorman <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20221118170510.kexdiqsfaqwledpm@suse.de/">seemed
more interested</a> in the proposed idea and the extension of the
<tt>movablecore</tt> kernel command-line parameter:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I don't see this approach being inherently bad as such, particularly in
	the appliance space where it is known in advance what exactly is running
	and what the requirements are. It's not automagical but it's not worse
	than specifying something like movablecore=100M@2G,100M@3G,1G@1024G. In
	either case, knowledge of the address ranges needing special treatment is
	required with the difference being that access to the special memory can
	be restricted by policies in the general case.
</blockquote>
<p>
He was also sympathetic to the requirement to fit within the Android common
kernel built in a GKI configuration:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Nodes can also interleave but it would have
	required CONFIG_NUMA so pointless for GKI and the current discussion other
	than with a time machine, GKI might have enabled CONFIG_NUMA :/
</blockquote>
<p>
He was helpful in asking relevant questions and seeking performance
numbers, which were provided during the discussion on <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20221020215318.4193269-1-opendmb@gmail.com/">the third
iteration</a> of the patch set.
<p>
So far, <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230311003855.645684-1-opendmb@gmail.com/">the fourth
version of the patch set</a> has not been commented on by either
maintainer, however efforts are still underway to seek inclusion of this
work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

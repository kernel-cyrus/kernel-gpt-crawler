In his session at the 2015 LSFMM Summit, Steven Whitehouse wanted to try to
pull together lots of individual projects that are 
affecting the interfaces between the filesystem and block layers.  There
may be certain 
commonalities between them, so it would be good if the projects know about each
other.  When looking at making interface changes, it is also important for
the storage and filesystem maintainers to 
consider the needs of all of these related projects rather than to just look
at them piecemeal.
</p>

<p>
These projects come under one of three broad headings: dynamic devices,
innovative I/O, and snapshots.  Dynamic devices refers to "intelligent
storage" devices; normally, a block device has the same characteristics
throughout its life, but dynamic devices change capacity or other
attributes over time.  Innovative I/O refers to working with devices like shingled
magnetic recording (SMR) and persistent memory devices as well as
supporting data 
integrity features like checksums.  Snapshots could fit in either of the
other two headings, but he thought it was best to pull them out on their own.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic devices are those that have
changes made to the device post-mount.  For example, thin provisioning
changes the capacity in the underlying devices in response to less
available disk spaceâ€”up to the capacity the kernel believes that it has. 
But dynamic devices may require a different kind of interface for error
reporting so 
that filesystems can distinguish between temporary and permanent errors.
Topology changes for multipath devices are another dynamic change.  If
Btrfs exeriences checksum failures while trying to read data, it may want
to be able to 
ask for a different mirror or to change the path to the data.   He asked, what
information is needed from the block layer and how do the filesystems get
that information?
</p>

<p>
There is a difference between informational reporting and error reporting,
James Bottomley said.  One contains hints that filesystems might want to
use, while the other means the filesystem needs to do something about the
event.  Another question is how applications would want to get that kind of
information, Ted Ts'o said, though it is clear that most applications won't
change to take advantage of this kind of information.
</p>

<p>
Hannes Reineke said that there have been some attempts to use udev
notifications to provide information to user space.  The problem with that
is there is no device information available for udev to attach the
information to.  Even if the information is available, there needs to be a
way to transport it, he said.
</p>

<p>
But it is the filesystems that really need to know about changes in the
block layer, Ts'o said.  Maybe there needs to be a callback added to
<tt>struct super</tt> that the block layer can make use of to alert
filesystems to changes.  Even a simple "something changed" message would be
helpful. 
</p>

<p>
There are a variety of new features that require different ways to
communicate between the filesystems and the block layer, Whitehouse said
in transitioning to the innovative I/O topic.  SMR devices need to provide
ways for the filesystem to find out where the write pointer is and the
layout of the zones in the device.  Data integrity (e.g. <a
href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41548">DIF/DIX</a>) requires ways
for checksums and/or checksum failures to be communicated between the block
and filesystem layers.  If the filesystem wants to read from a specific
disk in a mirror, to provide hints to the block layer,
or to initiate a copy offload operation, there needs to be an
interface available to do so.  He wondered if the same sorts of mechanisms
could be used to support all of these kinds of operations.
</p>

<p>
The short answer would seem to be "no".  Ts'o said that there are too many
differences for all of those to be able to share much.  But too much
specificity in the interfaces won't be good either, Ric Wheeler said.
Sometimes the right thing to request is for the block layer to "do
something different than you did last time" when there is an problem, he continued.
Christoph Hellwig agreed that "try again" can be the right approach for
both disk failures and transport failures, while Dave Chinner suggested
that adding some kind of "retry as hard as you can" operation might be helpful.
</p>

<p>
The problem comes back to error reporting and distinguishing transient from
permanent errors, which is a recurring topic in the storage and filesystems
tracks at LSFMM.  The kernel is currently limited to
the POSIX-defined errors, Chinner said.  What is really needed are more
fine-grained errors that give more information than just <tt>ENOSPC</tt>.
A proper error interface from the block layer is really needed, he said.
</p>

<p>
Getting consistency between the snapshot operations across various devices was
Whitehouse's last topic.  Trying to take a filesystem snapshot on a single
device is much different than doing so on a thin-provisioned array that may
involve multiple underlying block devices.  There are different
granularities for snapshots as well.  It could be that a single-file
snapshot or application snapshot (which might include files on multiple
filesystems) is desired. 
</p>

<p>
For this topic, though, there was little time for discussion.  Whitehouse
was able to at least introduce the problem a bit for consideration down the road.

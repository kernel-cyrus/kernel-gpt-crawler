<p>Probably the most powerful tracer derived from Ftrace is the
function tracer. It has the ability to trace practically every function in the
kernel. It can be run not just for debugging or analyzing, but also
to learn and observe the flow of the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Two previous articles, Debugging the Linux Kernel Using Ftrace
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/365835/">parts I</a> and 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366796/">II</a>, explain some of the basic features
of Ftrace and the function tracer; this article is written with the
assumption 
that the reader has already read them. As with the previous articles, the
examples in this article expect that
the user has already changed to the debug file system <tt>tracing</tt> directory.
The kernel configuration options that are need to be enabled to follow
the examples in this article are:</p>

<ul>
<li>CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
<li>CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
<li>CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
</ul>

<p>Note, the <tt>CONFIG_<b>HAVE</b>_FUNCTION_TRACER</tt>, <tt>CONFIG_<b>HAVE</b>_DYNAMIC_FTRACE</tt>,
and <tt>CONFIG_<b>HAVE</b>_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER</tt> options are enabled when the architecture
supports the corresponding feature. Do not confuse them with the listed options.
The features are only enabled when the listed configuration options are enabled
and not when only the <tt>_HAVE_</tt> options are.</p>

<p>As shown in the previous articles, here is a quick example of how to
enable the function tracer.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo function &gt; current_tracer
   [tracing]# cat trace
          &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 1726568.996435: hrtimer_get_next_event &lt;-get_next_timer_interrupt
          &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 1726568.996436: _spin_lock_irqsave &lt;-hrtimer_get_next_event
          &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 1726568.996436: _spin_unlock_irqrestore &lt;-hrtimer_get_next_event
          &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 1726568.996437: rcu_needs_cpu &lt;-tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick
          &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 1726568.996438: enter_idle &lt;-cpu_idle
          ...
</pre>

<p>The above shows you the process name (<tt>&lt;idle&gt;</tt>), PID (<tt>0</tt>) the CPU
that the trace executed on (<tt>[000]</tt>), a time-stamp in seconds with the
decimal places down to microseconds (<tt>1726568.996435</tt>) the function being
traced (<tt>hrtimer_get_next_event</tt>) and the parent that called that
function (<tt>get_next_timer_interrupt</tt>).</p>

<h4>Function filtering</h4>

<p>Running the function tracer can be overwhelming. The amount of data
may be vast, and very hard to get a hold of by the human brain.
Ftrace provides a way to limit what functions you see. Two files exist
that let you limit what functions are traced:<p>

<pre>
   set_ftrace_filter
   set_ftrace_notrace
</pre>


<p>These filtering features  depend on the <tt>CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE</tt>
option. 
As explained in the previous articles, when this configuration is enabled
all of the <tt>mcount</tt> caller locations are stored and at boot time are
converted into 
NOPs. These locations are saved and used to enable tracing when the function tracer
is activated.
But this also has a nice side effect: not all functions must be enabled.
The above files will determine which functions gets enabled and which do not.<p>

<p>When any function is listed in the <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>, only those functions will
be traced. This will help the performance of the system when the trace is
active. 
Tracing every function incurs a large overhead, but when using the <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>,
only those functions listed in that file will have the NOPs changed to call the tracer.
Depending on which functions are being traced, just having a couple of hundred functions
enabled is hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>The <tt>set_ftrace_notrace</tt> file is the opposite of <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>.
Instead of limiting the
trace to a set of functions, functions listed in <tt>set_ftrace_notrace</tt> will not be traced.
Some functions show up quite often and not only does tracing these functions slow down
the system, they can fill up the trace buffer and make it harder to analyze the
functions you care about. Functions such as <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> and <tt>spin_lock()</tt>

fall into this category.</p>

<p>The process to add functions to these files typically uses bash redirection.
Using the symbol '&gt;' will remove all existing functions in the file and add what
is being echoed into the file. Appending to the file using '&gt;&gt;' will keep the existing
functions and add new ones.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo sys_read &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   sys_read
   [tracing]# echo sys_write &gt;&gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   sys_write
   sys_read
   [tracing]# echo sys_open &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   sys_open
</pre>

<p>To remove all functions just echo a blank line into the filter file.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo sys_read sys_open sys_write &gt; set_ftrace_notrace 
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_notrace
   sys_open
   sys_write
   sys_read
   [tracing]# echo &gt; set_ftrace_notrace
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_notrace
   [tracing]#
</pre>

<p>The functions listed in these files can also be set on the kernel command line.
The options <tt>ftrace_notrace</tt> and <tt>ftrace_filter</tt> will preset
these files by listing a comma delimited set of functions.</p>

<pre>
   ftrace_notrace=rcu_read_lock,rcu_read_unlock,spin_lock,spin_unlock
   ftrace_filter=kfree,kmalloc,schedule,vmalloc_fault,spurious_fault
</pre>

<p>Functions added by the kernel command line set what will be in the
corresponding filter files. These options only pre-load the
files, functions can still be removed or added using the bash redirection
as explained above.<p>

<p>The functions listed in <tt>set_ftrace_notrace</tt> take precedence. That is, if a function
is listed in both <tt>set_ftrace_notrace</tt> and <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>, that function will not
be traced.

<h4>Wildcard filters</h4>

<p>A list of functions that can be added to the filter files is
shown in the <tt>available_filter_functions</tt> file. This list of functions was
derived from the list of stored <tt>mcount</tt> callers previously mentioned.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# cat available_filter_functions | head -8
   _stext
   do_one_initcall
   run_init_process
   init_post
   name_to_dev_t
   create_dev
   T.627
   set_personality_64bit
</pre>

<p>You can grep this file and redirect the result into one of the filter files:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# grep sched available_filter_functions &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter | head -8
   save_stack_address_nosched
   mce_schedule_work
   smp_reschedule_interrupt
   native_smp_send_reschedule
   sys32_sched_rr_get_interval
   sched_avg_update
   proc_sched_set_task
   sys_sched_get_priority_max
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, adding lots of functions to the filtering files is slow and you will notice that the
above grep took several seconds to execute. This is because each function
name written into the filter file will be processed individually. The above grep
produces over 300 function names. Each of those 300 names will be compared
(using <tt>strcmp()</tt>) against
every function name in the kernel, which is quite a lot.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# wc -l  available_filter_functions 
   24331 available_filter_functions

</pre>

<p>So the grep above caused <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> to generate over 300
* 24331 
(7,299,300) comparisons!</p>

<p>Fortunately, these files also take wildcards; the following glob expressions
are valid:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>value*</tt> - Select all functions that begin with <tt>value</tt>.

<li><tt>*value*</tt> - Select all functions that contain the text <tt>value</tt>.
<li><tt>*value</tt> - Select all functions that end with <tt>value</tt>.
</ul>

<p>The kernel contains a rather simple parser, and will not process
<tt>value*value</tt> in the expected way. It will ignore the second
<tt>value</tt> and select all functions that start with <tt>value</tt> regardless
of what it ends with.
Wildcards passed to the filter files are processed directly for each available
function, which is much faster than passing in individual functions in a
list.</p> 

<p>Because the star (*) is also used by bash, it is best to wrap the input with quotes:

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo set* &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   #### all functions enabled ####
   [tracing]# echo 'set*' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter | head -5
   set_personality_64bit
   set_intr_gate_ist
   set_intr_gate
   set_intr_gate
   set_tsc_mode
</pre>

<p>The filters can also select only those functions that belong to a specific
module by using the 'mod' command in the input to the filter file:</p>

<pre>

   [tracing]# echo ':mod:tg3' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter |head -8
   tg3_write32
   tg3_read32
   tg3_write_flush_reg32
   tw32_mailbox_flush
   tg3_write32_tx_mbox
   tg3_read32_mbox_5906
   tg3_write32_mbox_5906
   tg3_disable_ints
</pre>

<p>This is very useful if you are debugging a single module, and only
want to see the functions that belong to that module in the trace.</p>

In the earlier articles, enabling and disabling recording to the ring
buffer was done using the <tt>tracing_on</tt> file and the <tt>tracing_on()</tt> and
<tt>tracing_off()</tt> kernel functions. But if you do not want to
recompile the kernel, and you want to stop the tracing at a particular function,
<tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> has a method to do so.</p>

<p>The format of the command to have the function trace enable or disable
the ring buffer is 
as follows:</p>

<pre>
   function:command[:count]
</pre>

<p>This will execute the <tt>command</tt> at the start of the
<tt>function</tt>. The <tt>command</tt> is either
<tt>traceon</tt> or <tt>traceoff</tt>, and an optional <tt>count</tt> can
be added to have the command only execute a given number of times. If the
count is left off (including the leading colon) then the command
will be executed every time the function is called.<p>

<p>A while back, I was debugging a change to the kernel I made that was
causing a segmentation fault to some programs. I was having a hard time
catching the trace, because by the time I was able to stop the trace after seeing
the segmentation fault, the data had already been overwritten. But the backtrace
on the console showed that the function <tt>__bad_area_nosemaphore</tt> was
being called. I was then able to stop the tracer with the following command:</p>

<pre>

  [tracing]# echo '__bad_area_nosemaphore:traceoff' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
  [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
  #### all functions enabled ####
  __bad_area_nosemaphore:traceoff:unlimited
  [tracing]# echo function &gt; current_tracer
</pre>

<p>Notice that functions with commands do not affect the general filters.
Even though a command has been added to <tt>__bad_area_nosemaphore</tt>, the
filter 
still allowed all functions to be traced. Commands and filter functions are
separate 
and do not affect each other. With the above command attached to the function
<tt>__bad_area_nosemaphore</tt>, the next time the segmentation fault occurred,
the trace stopped and contained the data I needed to debug the situation.</p>


<h4>Removing functions from the filters</h4>

<p>As stated earlier, echoing in nothing with '&gt;' will clear the filter file.
But what if you only want to remove a few functions from the filter?</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter &gt; /tmp/filter
   [tracing]# grep -v lock /tmp/filter &gt; set_ftrace_filter
</pre>

<p>The above works, but as mentioned, it may take a while to complete if there were
several functions already in <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>. The following does the
same thing but is much faster:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo '!*lock*' &gt;&gt; set_ftrace_filter
</pre>

<p>The '!' symbol will remove functions listed in the filter file. As shown
above, the '!' works with wildcards, but could also be used with a single
function. Since '!' has special meaning in bash it must be wrapped with
single quotes or bash will try to execute what follows it. Also note the
'&gt;&gt;' is used. If you make the mistake of using '&gt;' you will end up with no
functions in the filter file.</p>

<p>Because the commands and filters do not interfere with each other, clearing
the <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> will not clear the commands. The commands
must be cleared with the '!' symbol.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo 'sched*' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# echo 'schedule:traceoff' &gt;&gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat trace | tail -5
   schedule_console_callback
   schedule_bh
   schedule_iso_resource
   schedule_reallocations
   schedule:traceoff:unlimited
   [tracing]# echo &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   #### all functions enabled ####
   schedule:traceoff:unlimited
   [tracing]# echo '!schedule:traceoff' &gt;&gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   #### all functions enabled ####
   [tracing]#
</pre>

<p>This may seem awkward, but having the '&gt;' and '&gt;&gt;' only affect
the functions to be traced and not the function commands, actually simplifies
the control between filtering functions and adding and removing commands.</p>

<h4>Tracing a specific process</h4>

<p>Perhaps you only need to trace a specific process, or set of processes.
The file <tt>set_ftrace_pid</tt> lets you specify specific processes that you want
to trace. To just trace the current thread you can do the following:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo $$ &gt; set_ftrace_pid
</pre>

<p>The above will set the function tracer to only trace the bash shell that executed
the <tt>echo</tt> command. If you want to trace a specific process, you can create
a shell script wrapper program.<p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# cat ~/bin/ftrace-me
   #!/bin/sh
   DEBUGFS=`grep debugfs /proc/mounts | awk '{ print $2; }'`
   echo $$ &gt; $DEBUGFS/tracing/set_ftrace_pid
   echo function &gt; $DEBUGFS/tracing/current_tracer
   exec $*
   [tracing]# ~/bin/ftrace-me ls -ltr
</pre>

<p>Note, you must clear the <tt>set_ftrace_pid</tt> file if you want to go back
to generic function tracing after performing the above.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo -1 &gt; set_ftrace_pid
</pre>

<h4>What calls a specific function?</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to know what is calling a particular function.
The immediate predecessor is helpful, but an entire backtrace is even better.
The function tracer contains an option that will create a backtrace in
the ring buffer for every function that is called by the tracer.
Since creating a backtrace for every function has a large overhead,
which could live lock the system, care must be taken when using this feature.
Imagine the timer interrupt on a slower system where it is run at
1000 HZ. It is quite possible that having every function that the timer interrupt
calls produce a backtrace could take 1 millisecond to complete. By the time
the timer interrupt returns, a new one will be triggered before any other work
can be done, which leads to a live lock.</p>

<p>
To use the function tracer backtrace feature, it is imperative that the functions
being called are limited by the function filters. The option to enable the function
backtracing is unique to the function tracer and activating it can only be
done when the function tracer is enabled. This means you must first enable
the function tracer before you have access to the option:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo kfree &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# cat set_ftrace_filter
   kfree
   [tracing]# echo function &gt; current_tracer
   [tracing]# echo 1 &gt; options/func_stack_trace
   [tracing]# cat trace | tail -8
    =&gt; sys32_execve
    =&gt; ia32_ptregs_common
                cat-6829  [000] 1867248.965100: kfree &lt;-free_bprm
                cat-6829  [000] 1867248.965100: &lt;stack trace&gt;

    =&gt; free_bprm
    =&gt; compat_do_execve
    =&gt; sys32_execve
    =&gt; ia32_ptregs_common
   [tracing]# echo 0 &gt; options/func_stack_trace
   [tracing]# echo &gt; set_ftrace_filter
</pre>

<p>Notice that I was careful to cat the <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> before enabling
the <tt>func_stack_trace</tt> option to ensure that the filter was enabled.
At the end, I disabled the <tt>options/func_stack_trace</tt> before disabling the filter.
Also note that the option is non-volatile, that is, even if you enable another
tracer plugin in <tt>current_tracer</tt>, the option will still be enabled if you re-enable
the function tracer.

</p>

<h4>The function_graph tracer</h4>

The function tracer is very powerful, but it may be difficult to understand the
linear format that it produces. Frederic Weisbecker has extended
the function tracer into the function_graph tracer. The function_graph tracer piggy-backs off of most of the code created by the function tracer, but adds its own hook
in the <tt>mcount</tt> call. Because it still uses the <tt>mcount</tt> calling methods
most of the function filtering explained above also applies to the function_graph
tracer, with the exception of the <tt>traceon</tt>/<tt>traceoff</tt> commands
and <tt>set_ftrace_pid</tt> (although the latter may change in the future).</p>

<p>The function_graph tracer was also explained in the previous articles,
but the <tt>set_graph_function</tt> file was not described.
The <tt>func_stack_trace</tt> used in the previous section can see what might call a function,
but <tt>set_graph_function</tt> can be used to see what a function calls:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo kfree &gt; set_graph_function
   [tracing]# echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer
   [tracing]# cat trace
   # tracer: function_graph
   #
   # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
   # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
    0)               |  kfree() {
    0)               |    virt_to_cache() {
    0)               |      virt_to_head_page() {
    0)   0.955 us    |        __phys_addr();
    0)   2.643 us    |      }
    0)   4.299 us    |    }

   [tracing]# echo &gt; set_graph_function

</pre>

<p>This displays the call graph performed only by <tt>kfree()</tt>.
The "<tt>==========&gt;</tt>" shows that an interrupt happened during the
call. The trace records all functions within the <tt>kfree()</tt>
block, even those functions called by an interrupt that triggered while
in the scope of <tt>kfree()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The function_graph tracer shows the time a function took in the duration
field. In the previous articles, it was mentioned that only the leaf
functions, the ones that do not call other functions, have an accurate
duration, since the duration of parent functions also includes the
overhead of the function_graph tracer calling the child functions. By
using the <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> file, you can force any function
into becoming a leaf function in the function_graph tracer, and this
will allow you to see an accurate duration of that function.
</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo smp_apic_timer_interrupt &gt; set_ftrace_filter
   [tracing]# echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer
   [tracing]# cat trace | head
   # tracer: function_graph
   #
   # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
   # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
    1)   ==========&gt; |
    1) + 16.433 us   |  smp_apic_timer_interrupt();
    1)   ==========&gt; |
    1) + 25.897 us   |  smp_apic_timer_interrupt();
    1)   ==========&gt; |
    1) + 24.764 us   |  smp_apic_timer_interrupt();
</pre>

<p>
The above shows that the timer interrupt takes between 16 and 26
microseconds to complete.
</p>


<h4>Function profiling</h4>

<p><tt>oprofile</tt> and <tt>perf</tt> are very powerful profiling
tools that take periodic samples of the system and can show where
most of the time is spent. With the function profiler, it is possible to
take a good look at the actual function execution and not just samples.
If <tt>CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER</tt> is configured in the kernel, the function
profiler will use the function graph infrastructure to record how long a function
has been executing. If just <tt>CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER</tt> is configured,
the function profiler will just count the functions being called.
</p>

<pre>

   [tracing]# echo nop &gt; current_tracer
   [tracing]# echo 1 &gt; function_profile_enabled
   [tracing]# cat trace_stat/function 0 |head
     Function                               Hit    Time            Avg

</pre>

<p>The above also includes the times that a function has been preempted or
<tt>schedule()</tt> was called and the task was swapped out.
This may seem useless, but it does give an idea of what functions get
preempted often. Ftrace also includes options that allow
you to have the function graph tracer ignore the time the task was
scheduled out.
</p>

</pre>

<p>Note that the <tt>sleep-time</tt> option contains a "-" and is not
<tt>sleep_time</tt>.</p>

<p>Disabling the function profiler and then re-enabling it causes the
numbers to reset. The list is sorted by the <tt>Avg</tt> times, but
using scripts you can easily sort by any of the numbers.
The <tt>trace_stat/function0</tt> only represents CPU 0. There exists a

<tt>trace_stat/function#</tt> for each CPU on the system.
All functions that are traced and have been hit are in this file.</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# cat trace_stat/function0  | wc -l
   2978
</pre>

<p>Functions that were not hit are not listed. The above shows that 2978 functions
were hit since I started the profiling.

<p>Another option that affects profiling is <tt>graph-time</tt> (again with a "-").
By default it is enabled. When enabled, the times for a function include the
times of all the functions that were called within the function. As you can
see from the output in the above examples, several system calls are listed with
the highest average. When disabled, the times only include the execution of the
function itself, and do not contain the times of functions that are called
from the function:</p>

<pre>
   [tracing]# echo 0 &gt; options/graph-time
   [tracing]# echo 0 &gt; function_profile_enabled
   [tracing]# echo 1 &gt; function_profile_enabled
   [tracing]# cat trace_stat/function0  | head
     Function                               Hit    Time            Avg

</pre>

<p>
Note that both <tt>sleep-time</tt> and <tt>graph-time</tt> also affect the
duration times displayed by the function_graph tracer.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The function tracer is very powerful with lots of different options.
It is already available in mainline Linux, and hopefully will be enabled by
default in most distributions. It allows you to see into the depths of the kernel
and with its arsenal of features, gives you a good idea of why things are
happening the way they do. Start using the function tracer to open up the
black box that we call the kernel. Have fun!<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p><em>The kernel contains a rather simple parser, and will not process value*value in the expected way. It will ignore the second value and select all functions that start with value regardless of what it ends with.</em></p>

<p><em>The '!' symbol will remove functions listed in the filter file. As shown above, the '!' works with wildcards, but could also be used with a single function.</em></p>

<p>Some questions arose in my mind while reading above paragraphs: how hard was it to convince the kernel devs of including a parser in the kernel? Is the grammar rigorous enough, or does it depend on hidden instincts?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for informing us about those tracers; everybody should use them more.</p>

The grammar is very basic and the code to handle it is quite simple. Which means it is easy to verify. Only privileged users can write to it, thus security is not as much of a concern. If you have the privilege to write to this file, you also have the privilege to do a lot of other harm to the kernel.<br>
<p>
I have joked about implementing a full perl regex parser in the kernel, but I doubt that many developers would let that by ;-)<br>

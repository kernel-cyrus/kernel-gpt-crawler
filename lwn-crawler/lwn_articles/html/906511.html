Huge pages are a mechanism implemented by the CPU that allows the management
of memory in larger chunks.  Use of huge pages can increase performance
significantly, which is why the kernel has a "transparent huge page"
mechanism to try to create them when possible.  But a huge page will only
be helpful if most of the memory contained within it is actually in use;
otherwise it is just an expensive waste of memory.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1661461643.git.alexlzhu@fb.com/">This patch
set</a> from Alexander Zhu implements a mechanism to detect underutilized
huge pages and recover that wasted memory for other uses.
<p>
The base page size on most systems running Linux is 4,096 bytes, a number
which has remained unchanged for many years even as the amount of memory
installed in those systems has grown.  By grouping (typically) 512
physically contiguous base pages into a huge page, it is possible to reduce
the overhead of managing those pages.  More importantly, though, huge pages
take far fewer of the processor's scarce translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
slots, which cache the results of virtual-to-physical address translations.
TLB misses can be quite expensive, so expanding the amount of memory that
can be covered by the TLB (as huge pages do) can improve performance
significantly.
<p>
The downside of huge pages (as with larger page sizes in general) is
internal fragmentation.  If only part of a huge page is actually being
used, the rest is wasted memory that cannot be used for any other purpose.
Since such a page contains little useful memory, the hoped-for TLB-related
performance improvements will not be realized. 
In the worst cases, it would clearly make sense to break a poorly utilized
huge page back into base pages and only keep those that are clearly in use.
The kernel's memory-management subsystem can break up huge pages to, among
other things, facilitate reclaim, but it is not equipped to focus its
attention specifically on underutilized huge pages.
<p>
Zhu's patch set aims to fill that gap in a few steps, the first being 
figuring out which of the huge pages in the system are being fully utilized
— and which are not.  To that end, a scanning function is run every second
from a kernel workqueue; each run will look at up to 256 huge pages to
determine how fully each is utilized.  Only anonymous huge pages are
scanned; this work doesn't address file-backed huge pages.
The results can be read out of
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/thp_utilization</tt> in the form of a table like
this:
<p>
<pre>
    Utilized[0-50]: 1331 680884
    Utilized[51-101]: 9 3983
    Utilized[102-152]: 3 1187
    Utilized[153-203]: 0 0
    Utilized[204-255]: 2 539
    Utilized[256-306]: 5 1135
    Utilized[307-357]: 1 192
    Utilized[358-408]: 0 0
    Utilized[409-459]: 1 57
    Utilized[460-512]: 400 13
    Last Scan Time: 223.98
    Last Scan Duration: 70.65
</pre>
<p>
This output (taken from the cover letter) is a histogram showing the number
of huge pages containing a given number of utilized base pages.  The first
line, for example, shows the number of huge pages for which no more than 50
base pages are in active use.  There are 1,331 of those pages, containing
680,884 unused base pages.  There is a
clear shape to the results: nearly all pages fall into one of the two
extremes.  As a general rule, a huge page is either fully utilized or
almost entirely unused.
<p>
An important question to answer when interpreting this data is: how does
the code determine which base pages within a huge page are actually used?
The CPU and memory-management unit do not provide much help in this task;
if the memory is mapped as a huge page, there is no per-base-page "accessed" bit
to look at.  Instead, Zhu's patch scans through the memory itself to see
what is stored there.  Any base pages that contain only zeroes are deemed
to be unused, while those containing non-zero data are counted as being
used.  It is clearly not a perfect heuristic; a program could initialize
pages with non-zero data then never touch them again.  But it may be
difficult to design a better one that doesn't involve actively breaking
apart huge pages into base pages.
<p>
The results of this scanning identify a clear subset of the huge pages in a
system that should perhaps be broken apart.  In current kernels, though,
splitting a zero-filled huge page will result in the creation of a lot of
zero-filled base pages — and no immediate recovery of the unused memory.
Zhu's patch set changes the splitting of huge pages so that it simply drops
zero-filled base pages rather than remapping them into the process's
address space.  Since these are anonymous pages, the kernel will quickly
substitute a new, zero-filled page should the process eventually reference
one of the dropped pages.
<p>
The final step is to actively break up underutilized huge pages when the
kernel is looking for memory to reclaim.  To that end, the scanner will add
the least-utilized pages (those in the <tt>0-50</tt> bucket shown above) to
a new linked list so that they can be found 
quickly.    A
new shrinker is registered with the memory-management subsystem that can be
called when memory is tight.  When invoked, that shrinker will pull some
entries from the list of underutilized huge pages and split them, resulting
in the return of all zero-filled base pages found there to the system.
<p>
Most of the comments on this patch set have been focused on details rather
than the overall premise.  David Hildenbrand <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/00f2dee2-ebc1-e732-f230-bc5b17da9f80@redhat.com/">expressed
a concern</a> that unmapping zero-filled pages in an area managed by a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
handler could create confusion if that handler subsequently receives page
faults it was not expecting.  Zhu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/A92C4953-F9BC-4687-BB03-2202D94D6F5D@fb.com/">answered</a>
that, if this is a concern, zero-filled base pages in
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt>-managed areas could be mapped to the kernel's shared
zero page instead.
<p>
The kernel has supported transparent huge pages since the feature was <a
href="/Articles/423584/">merged</a> into the 2.6.38 kernel in 2011, but it
is still not enabled for all processes.  One of the reasons for
holding back is the internal-fragmentation problem, which can outweigh the
benefits that transparent huge pages provide.  Zhu's explicit goal is to
make that problem go away, allowing the enabling of transparent huge pages
by default.  If this work is successful, it could represent an important
step for a longstanding kernel feature that, arguably, has never quite
lived up to its potential.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In the README file of one of my HPC projects I have a section that describes how to enable transparent huge pages on Linux in order to get the best performance. Based on my experience, enabling transparent huge pages can provide a huge speed up on workloads that use a lot of RAM (&gt; 50 GiB) e.g. one of my application&#x27;s algorithms runs twice as fast if transparent huge pages are enabled. Any patch that brings us closer to enabling transparent huge pages by default is highly appreciated by me.<br>

Serious question, is there a reason your code doesn&#x27;t check if it&#x27;s running on Linux at compile time and if so just utilize madvise() to explicitly request THP?<br>
<p>
Because all distro&#x27;s I&#x27;ve encountered for a few years now leave it set to madvise not disabling it entirely at least. And at this point the madvise() with MADV_HUGEPAGE is by orders of magnitude the most reliable and least troublesome way to utilize huge pages on Linux since everything else requires mucking about with lots of individual knobs by comparison.<br>

My application supports many different operating systems, not only Linux. I try to keep my code base portable, I am willing to add workarounds for specific operating systems to my application if it will provide a significant benefit to my users and the workaround is relatively small. However, in this case I don&#x27;t think is worth the effort. In my opinion the current Linux support of transparent huge pages is a mess (to be fair, on Windows it is even worse) and I prefer to simply wait until the situation improves and hopefully transparent huge pages will eventually be enabled by default.<br>

      I guess that's my point: It is enabled by default and has been for almost a decade now, just behind madvise where the interface to use it becomes trivial.

<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt; // Also used for various posix functions, cross platform
const int alignment = 1 &lt;&lt; 21;
const int size = 16 &lt;&lt; 21;
int main( void ) {
    void *x = aligned_alloc( alignment, size );

#ifdef MADV_HUGEPAGE
    if ( x != NULL ) {
        madvise( x, size, MADV_HUGEPAGE  );
    }
#endif

    printf( "Go run: grep -i hugepage /proc/meminfo\nPausing for 60 seconds.\n" );
    sleep( 60 );

    return 0;
}

      Often I get fewer huge pages than requested, even with 32GB of RAM on a (now) lightly-loaded system that has been up for a week or so:

<pre><tt>    system("echo \"requested 32MB of anon huge pages:\";\
            grep -i hugepage /proc/meminfo");
    //printf( "Go run: grep -i hugepage /proc/meminfo\nPausing for 60 seconds.\n" );
    //sleep( 60 );

requested 32MB of anon huge pages:
AnonHugePages:      6144 kB
ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
FileHugePages:         0 kB
HugePages_Total:       0
HugePages_Free:        0
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
</tt></pre>
<p>Also remember: <tt>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt> if <tt>printf</tt> remains in the source.

      Sorry, minor oversight on my part, since you do need to fault the RAM in before it exists. The program was literally typed from memory as an example, sorry if I missed an include. :P

<pre>
#ifdef MADV_HUGEPAGE
    if ( x != NULL ) {
        madvise( x, size, MADV_HUGEPAGE )
        for ( int i = 0; i &lt; size; i += alignment ) {
            ((char *)x)[i] = 0;
        }
    }
#endif
</pre>

If you fault the pages in before the madvise then you have to wait for the THP scanner to circle back around and find things, but if you madvise before you fault the pages in then each fault is generated as a THP directly so you also need a lot less page faults to actually commit all the RAM you allocated, since Linux is (too) aggressive about overcommit until pages are actually accessed.

A similar, I think, mechanism was presented in <br>

BTW, shouldn&#x27;t this be called &quot;transparent huge page *splitter*&quot;? :)<br>

There already is a (very well tested) splitter though. :)<br>

I think &quot;shrinker&quot; is a term for &quot;program the kernel uses to reduce memory consumption when low on memory&quot;.<br>

SUSE has set thp enable to always and defrag to madvise.<br>
I wonder what&#x27;s the history there.<br>

From my memory the main issues encountered with thp were mostly poor scalability of the defragmentation on large machines.<br>
<p>
When we first saw it was I think a RHEL 6 where thp were immediately backported to some very old kernel version and enabled with defrag by default.<br>
On machines with many cpu cores and certain workloads this caused basically 100% system load defragmenting.<br>
<p>
The fix back then for us was disabling the automatic defragmentation and only run it when needed. Though many opted to just flat out disabling it globally and since then thp has a pretty bad reputation despite the issues mostly all being fixed today.<br>

The other long-standing issue has been software using jemalloc which doesn&#x27;t actually &#x27;free&#x27; memory when it&#x27;s done with it most of the time but just uses MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE so it ends up actively fighting with khugepaged which then re-faults those &#x27;all zero&#x27; pages to merge them together again since they&#x27;re still tied to the process.<br>
<p>
So in effect software using jemalloc with THP enabled and lots of small allocations and frees would suddenly have the worst-case &quot;lots of wasted RAM&quot; situation almost immediately.<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s also why so much jemalloc-using software has a much higher resident size quite often is from all of those &quot;I&#x27;m done with these... but I won&#x27;t pay the memory-fault costs to actually free them (BENCHMARKS, AHOY!) so I&#x27;ll use the lazy-free madvise call instead&quot; situations.<br>

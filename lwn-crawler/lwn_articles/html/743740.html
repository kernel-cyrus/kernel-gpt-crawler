Realtime systems are computing systems that must react within precise time
constraints to events. In such systems, the correct behavior does not
depend only on the logical behavior, but also in the timing behavior. In
other words, the response for a request is only correct if the logical
result is correct and produced within a deadline. If the system fails to
provide the response within the deadline, the system is showing a defect.
In a multitasking operating system, such as Linux, a realtime scheduler
is responsible for coordinating the access to the CPU, to ensure that all
realtime tasks in the system accomplish their job within the deadline.
<p>

The deadline scheduler enables the user to specify the tasks' requirements
using well-defined realtime abstractions, allowing the system to make
the best scheduling decisions, guaranteeing the scheduling of realtime
tasks even in higher-load systems.
<p>

This article provides an introduction to realtime scheduling and some of
the theory behind it.  The second installment will be dedicated
to the Linux deadline scheduler in particular.
<p>
<h4>Realtime schedulers in Linux</h4>
<p>

Realtime tasks differ from non-realtime tasks by the constraint of having
to produce a response for an event within a deadline. To schedule a
realtime task to accomplish its timing requirements, Linux provides two
realtime schedulers: the POSIX realtime scheduler (henceforth called the
"realtime scheduler") and the deadline scheduler. 

<p>
The POSIX realtime scheduler, which provides the FIFO (first-in-first-out)
and RR (round-robin) scheduling policies,
schedules each task according to its fixed priority.
The task with the highest priority will be served
first. In realtime theory, this scheduler is classified as a
fixed-priority scheduler. The difference between the FIFO and RR schedulers
can be seen when two tasks share the same priority. In the FIFO scheduler,
the task that arrived first will
receive the processor, running until it goes to sleep. In the RR scheduler,
the tasks with the
same priority will share the processor in a round-robin fashion. Once an RR
task starts to run, it will run for a maximum quantum of time. If the task
does not block before the end of that time slice, the scheduler will
put the task at the end of the round-robin queue of the tasks with the same
priority and select the next task to run.
<p>
In contrast, the deadline scheduler, as its name says, schedules each task
according to the task's deadline. The task with the earliest deadline will
be served first.
Each scheduler requires a different setup for
realtime tasks. In the realtime scheduler, the user needs to provide the
scheduling 
policy and the fixed priority. For example:
<p>
<pre>
    chrt -f 10 video_processing_tool
</pre>
<p>

With this command, the <tt>video_processing_tool</tt> task will be
scheduled by the realtime scheduler, with a priority of 10, under the FIFO
policy (as requested by the <tt>-f</tt> flag). 
<p>
In the deadline scheduler, instead, the user has three
parameters to set: the period, the run time, and the deadline.
The period is the activation pattern of the realtime task. In a practical
example, if a video-processing task must process 60 frames per second, a
new frame will arrive every 16&nbsp;milliseconds, so the period is
16&nbsp;milliseconds.
<p>
The run time is the amount of CPU time that the application needs to
produce the output. In the most conservative case, the runtime must be the
worst-case execution time (WCET), which is the maximum amount of time the
task needs to process one period's worth of work. For example, a video
processing tool may
take, in the worst case, five milliseconds to process the image. Hence its
run time is five milliseconds.
<p>
The deadline is the maximum time in which the result must be delivered by
the task, relative to the period. For example, if the task needs to deliver
the processed frame within ten milliseconds, the deadline will be ten
milliseconds.
<p>

It is possible to set deadline scheduling parameters using the
<tt>chrt</tt> command. For example, the above-mentioned tool could be started
with the following command:
<p>
<pre>
    chrt -d --sched-runtime 5000000 --sched-deadline 10000000 \
    	    --sched-period 16666666 0 video_processing_tool
</pre>
<p>
Where:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>--sched-runtime 5000000</tt> is the run time specified in
     nanoseconds
<li> <tt>--sched-deadline 10000000</tt> is the relative deadline specified
     in nanoseconds. 
<li> <tt>--sched-period 16666666</tt> is the period specified in
     nanoseconds
<li> <tt>0</tt> is a placeholder for the (unused) priority, required by
     the <tt>chrt</tt> command
</ul>
<p>
In this way, the task will have a guarantee of 5ms of CPU time every
16.6ms, and all of that CPU time will be available for the task before the 
10ms deadline passes.
<p>
Although the deadline scheduler's configuration looks complex, it is not. By
giving the correct parameters, which are only dependent on the application
itself, the user does not need to be aware of all the other tasks in the
system to be sure 
that the application will deliver its results before the deadline. When
using the realtime scheduler, instead, the user must take into account all
of the system's tasks 
to be able to define which is the correct fixed priority for any task.
<p>
Since the deadline scheduler knows how much
CPU each deadline task will need, it knows when the
system can (or cannot) admit new tasks. So, rather than allowing the user to
overload the system, the deadline scheduler denies the addition of more
deadline tasks, guaranteeing that all deadline tasks will have CPU time to
accomplish their tasks with, at least, a bounded tardiness.
<p>
In order to further discuss benefits of the deadline scheduler it is
necessary to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. To that end,
the next section explains a little bit about realtime scheduling theory.
<p>
<h4>A realtime scheduling overview</h4>
<p>

In scheduling theory, realtime schedulers are evaluated by
their ability to schedule a set of tasks while meeting the timing
requirements of all realtime tasks. In order to provide deterministic
response times, realtime tasks must have a deterministic timing
behavior. The task model describes the deterministic behavior of a task.
<p>

Each realtime task is composed of <i>N</i> recurrent activations; a task
activation is known as a <b>job</b>. A task is said to be <b>periodic</b>
when a job takes place after a fixed offset of time from its previous
activation. For instance, a periodic task with period of 2ms will be
activated every 2ms. Tasks can also be <b>sporadic</b>. A sporadic task is
activated after, at least, a minimum inter-arrival time from its previous
activation. For instance, a sporadic task with a 2ms period will be
activated after at least 2ms from the previous activation. Finally, a
task can be <b>aperiodic</b>, when there is no activation pattern that can be
established.
<p>

Tasks can have an <b>implicit deadline</b>, when the deadline is equal to the
activation period, or a <b>constrained deadline</b>, when the deadline can
be less than (or equal to) the period. Finally, a task can have an
<b>arbitrary deadline</b>, where the deadline is unrelated to the period.

<p>
Using these patterns, realtime researchers have developed ways to compare
scheduling algorithms by their ability to schedule a given task set. It
turns out 
that, for uniprocessor systems, the Early Deadline First (EDF) scheduler
was found to be optimal. A scheduling algorithm is optimal when it fails to
schedule a task set only when no other scheduler can schedule it. The
deadline scheduler is optimal for periodic and sporadic tasks with deadlines
less than or equal to their periods on uniprocessor systems.

Actually, 
for either periodic or sporadic tasks with implicit deadlines,
the EDF scheduler can schedule any task set as long as
the task set does not use more than 100% of the CPU time. The Linux deadline
scheduler implements the EDF algorithm.
<p>

Consider, for instance,  a system with three periodic tasks with deadlines
equal to their periods:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
  <tr><th>Task</th>
      <th>Runtime<br>(WCET)</th>
      <th>Period</th></tr>
  <tr><td>T<sub>1</sub></td> <td>1</td> <td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>T<sub>2</sub></td> <td>2</td> <td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>T<sub>3</sub></td> <td>3</td> <td>8</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
The CPU time utilization (U) of this task set is less than 100%:
<p>
<pre>
    U =  1/4 + 2/6 + 3/8 = 23/24 
</pre>
<p>

For such a task set, the EDF scheduler would present the following behavior:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/dl.png" alt="[Scheduling chart]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>

However, it is not possible to use a fixed-priority scheduler to schedule
this task set while meeting every deadline; regardless of the assignment of
priorities, one task will not run in time to get its work done.  The
resulting behavior will look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/fp.png" alt="[Scheduling chart]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>


The main advantage of deadline scheduling is that, once you know each
task's parameters, you do not need to analyze all of the other tasks to
know that your 
tasks will all meet their deadlines. Deadline scheduling often results in fewer
context switches and, on uniprocessor systems, deadline scheduling is
able to schedule more tasks than fixed priority-scheduling while meeting
every task's deadline.  However, the deadline scheduler also has  some
disadvantages.
<p>

The deadline scheduler provides a guarantee of accomplishing each task's
deadline, but it is not possible to ensure a minimum response time for any
given task. In the fixed-priority scheduler, the highest-priority task
always has the minimum response time, but that is not possible to guarantee
with the deadline scheduler.  The EDF scheduling algorithm is also more complex
than fixed-priority, which can be implemented
with O(1) complexity. In contrast, the deadline scheduler is
O(log(n)). However, the fixed-priority requires an “offline computation” of
the best set of priorities by the user, which can be as complex as O(N!).
<p>

If, for some reason, the system becomes overloaded, for instance due to the
addition of a new task or a wrong WCET estimation, it is possible to face a
domino effect: once one task misses its deadline by running for more than its
declared run time, all other tasks may miss their deadlines as shown by
the regions in red below:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/domino.png" alt="[Domino effect]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
In contrast, with fixed-priority scheduling, only the tasks with lower
priority than the task which missed the deadline will be affected.
<p>
In addition to the prioritization problem, multi-core
systems add an allocation problem. On a multi-core system, the scheduler
also needs to decide where the tasks can run. Generally, the scheduler can
be classified as one of the following:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/schedtypes.png" alt="[Scheduler types]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Global</b>: When a single scheduler manages all M CPUs of the
     system. In other words, tasks can migrate to all CPUs. 

<li> <b>Clustered</b>: When a single scheduler manages a disjoint subset of
     the M CPUs. In other words, tasks can migrate to just a subset of the
     available CPUs. 

<li> <b>Partitioned</b>: When each scheduler manages a single CPU, so no
     migration is allowed. 

<li> <b>Arbitrary</b>: Each task can run on an arbitrary set of CPUs.
</ul>
<p>
In multi-core systems, global, clustered, and arbitrary deadline
schedulers are not optimal. The theory for multi-core scheduling is more
complex than for single-core systems due to many anomalies. For example, in
a system with M&nbsp;processors, it is possible to schedule M&nbsp;tasks
with a
run time equal to the period. For instance, a system with four processors can
schedule four "BIG" tasks with both run time and period equal to 1000ms. In this
case, the system will reach the maximum utilization 
of:
<p>
<pre>
    4 * 1000/1000 = 4
</pre>
<p>
The resulting scheduling behavior will look like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/bigs.png" alt="[Four big tasks]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>


It is intuitive to think that a system with a lower load will be
schedulable too, as it is for single-processor systems.  For example, in a
system with four processors, a task set composed of four small tasks with
the 
minimum runtime, let's say 1ms, at every 999 milliseconds period,
and just one task BIG task, with runtime and period of one second. The load
of this system is:
<p>
<pre>
    4 * (1/999) + 1000/1000 = 1.004
</pre>
<p>

As 1.004 is smaller than four, intuitively, one might say that the system is
schedulable, But that is not true for global EDF scheduling. 
That is because, if all tasks are released at the same time, the M small
tasks will be scheduled in the M available processors. Then, the big task
will be 
able to start only after the small tasks have run, hence
finishing its computation  after
its deadline. As
illustrated below. This is known as the Dhall's effect.
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/deadline/dhall.png" alt="[Dhall's effect]"
class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>

Distribution of tasks to processors turns out to be an NP-hard problem (a
bin-packing problem, essentially) and, due to other anomalies, there is no
dominance of one scheduling algorithm over any others.
<p>
With this background in place, we can turn to the details of the Linux
deadline scheduler and the best ways to take advantage of its capabilities
while avoiding the potential problems.  See <a href="/Articles/743946/">the second half of this series</a>,

Back when I was doing schedulers for distributed computing, we converged on a bin-packing algorithm with some heuristics to handle its pathological cases. <br>
<p>
It worked wonders and was simple to implement.<br>

I'm surprised that the deadline scheduler doesn't preempt tasks that run over their declared run time, either immediately or at the point where they would interfere with other tasks making their deadlines. Preempting them immediately seems like it would be technically easy, since that's normal scheduler functionality, and like it would be necessary to meet the goal of having the fewest possible misses if the requested schedule is impossible, as well as penalizing the task that makes the schedule impossible.<br>

Hi!<br>
<p>
There is one mechanism on the Linux implementation of the deadline scheduler that prevents the domino effect. This mechanism is the CBS. It will be explained in the next article of the series ;).<br>

           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2017-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
<p>
In the refereed track at the 2017 Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC), Jiri Kosina
gave an update on the status and plans for the live kernel patching
feature.  It is a feature that has a long history—pre-dating Linux
itself—and has had a multi-year path into the kernel.  Kosina reviewed that
history, while also looking at  some of the limitations and missing
features for live patching.
</p>

<p>
The first question that gets asked about patching a running kernel is
"why?", he said.  That question gets asked in the comments on <a
href="/Articles/706327/">LWN articles</a> and elsewhere.  The main driver
of the feature is the high cost of downtime in data centers.  That leads
data center operators to plan outages many months in advance to reduce the
cost; but in the case of a zero-day vulnerability, that time is not available.
Live kernel patching is targeted at making small security fixes as a
stopgap measure 
until the kernel can be updated during a less-hurried, planned outage.
It is not meant for replacing the kernel bit by bit over time, but as an
emergency measure when the kernel is vulnerable.
</p>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
The history of the idea behind live patching goes back at least as far as
the 1940s, he said.  He referenced the classic Richard Feynman book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!"><i>Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i></a>, where Feynman described a system he
used to change the program being run by early proto-computers.  He
color-coded certain groups of punch cards in the program.  That way, he
could replace a small subset of the program in a non-destructive way.  That
was the beginning of live patching, Kosina said.
</p>

<p>
The first implementation of live patching for Linux that he is aware of is
ksplice, which was <a href="/Articles/280058/">announced in 2008</a>. It
was originally a research project for a PhD. thesis and the code was
released as open-source software.  The mechanism used
<tt>stop_machine()</tt> to stop the kernel, then inspected the stack to see
if the patch would interfere with any task currently running.  If the
function being patched was found on the stack, ksplice refused to patch it
and retried later.
</p>

<p>
One of the major contributions that ksplice made was in its automatic patch
generation by comparing binary kernels, he said.  The original kernel
binary and the 
patched kernel binary were compared.  Function inlining and other
optimizations make it hard to know what actually will change even from a
simple source code change. The ksplice project was acquired by Oracle
in 2011 and the source code was closed; it is still used by the Oracle
Linux distribution today.
</p>

<p>
Based on requests from SUSE customers, Kosina had been working on an
alternative approach, kGraft, which was <a
href="/Articles/596854/">released in 2014</a>.  Around the same time, Red Hat
<a href="/Articles/597407/">released kpatch</a>, which it had been working
on; both were aimed at live
kernel patching, but had different ways to to achieve convergence to a
fully patched state.  Kpatch was similar to ksplice, in that it stopped the
system and inspected its state, while kGraft used a lazy migration
technique to slowly migrate all processes to use the new code.  That lazy
migration normally takes just milliseconds to complete.
</p>

<p>
The kGraft patches are commercially supported by SUSE, which violates the
company's "upstream first" principle, he said.  Patches are created
manually, with 
the help of the toolchain, which has some advantages over automatic binary
comparisons.  Even with automatic generation, there is a need to look at
the patch generated (and to possibly adjust it); for example, if a
structure needs to change, existing versions of the structure need to be
modified in place.  There is still a need for more tooling to assist with
the manual patch generation, he said.
</p>

<p>
As a side note, Kosina pointed to the <a
href="/Articles/525675/">checkpoint/restore in user space</a> (CRIU)
project as another potential way to do a kind of live patching.  For some
use cases, it might make sense to checkpoint all of the user-space
processes, <tt>kexec()</tt> to the new kernel, then restore all of user
space.   That would allow changing to a completely new kernel, but it would
not be immediate (or live).  It also would reinitialize the hardware, which
may not be desirable.
</p>

<p>
He went into a bit more detail on the lazy migration scheme.  After the
patch is made, a
process that enters or leaves the kernel gets marked as now living in the
"new universe", so it will always get the patched function from that point
on.  Anything that is running in the kernel at the time of the patch will
end up running the old version of the code; a trampoline function is used
to decide which of the two versions of the function to call.  Kernel
threads have been marked with "safe points" where the switch can be made,
which turned out to not be that difficult, surprisingly.  In addition, long-sleeping processes (e.g. blocking in <tt>get_tty()</tt>) are identified and
sent a fake signal that simply has the effect of setting the new-universe
flag and putting them back to sleep. 
</p>

<h4>A meeting of the minds</h4>

<p>
There were competing solutions, so a <a
href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LPC2014_LivePatching.txt">meeting
was held</a> at the 2014 LPC in Düsseldorf to discuss the matter.  Each
solution was presented and the developers came up with a plan to try to
merge one unified scheme.  It would start with a minimal base on top
of Ftrace, with a simple API.  Live patches could be registered with a list
of functions to be replaced, and it only supported a limited set of patch
types that could be applied.  That was <a href="/Articles/634649/">merged
into the mainline</a> in February 2015.

<p>
Since then, ideas have been 
cherry-picked from kpatch and kGraft to be added to the kernel under the
<tt>CONFIG_LIVEPATCH</tt> option.  There is now a combined, hybrid
consistency model that uses lazy migration by default, but falls back to
stack examination for long-sleeping processes and kthreads.   Originally,
the feature was x86-only, but it has been added to s390 and PowerPC-64,
with ARM64 in the works.
</p>

<p>
The stack examination is a crucial piece of the feature; without reliable
stack unwinding, it is impossible to provide consistency.  Josh  Poimboeuf
created the <a href="/Articles/728339/">ORC unwinder</a> to provide a
reliable way to get a stack trace.  In addition, <a
href="/Articles/658333/"><tt>objtool</tt> (formerly <tt>stacktool</tt>)
has been added</a> to ensure that assembly language pieces of the kernel
will also produce a valid stack trace.
</p>

<p>
Earlier efforts at getting reliable stack traces either used frame
pointers, which had a severe performance penalty, or DWARF debugging
records, which turned out to be unreliable and slow.  ORC is effectively a
stripped-down version of DWARF that has nothing more than is needed for
reliable stack unwinding.  The ORC unwinder was merged into 4.14 and will
also be used for oops and panic output.  So far, it is only available for
x86_64, but is in progress for other architectures; the main work is on
<tt>objtool</tt>, Kosina said, as the ORC unwinder is straightforward to port.
</p>

<p>
Patches are currently hand-written, though tools are coming.  The source
for a patch is a single C file, which makes it easy to review and to store
in Git.  It creates new functions and declares them as replacements for
existing kernel functions; that gets compiled into a loadable kernel module
that has an initialization function to register the replacements and then
to enable 
those changes.
</p>

<h4>More to do</h4>

<p>
There are some limitations of the feature, currently.  For one, there is no
way to deal with data structure changes or changes to the semantics of
existing elements.  There may be a straightforward solution for simply
adding a new field to an existing structure using shadow variables.  A
"lazy state transformation", analogous to lazy migration, may be another
way to deal with changing data structures; new functions that can work with
both the old and new structures could be created.
</p>

<p>
There are still some problems with those approaches, however. Many kernel
data structures are protected by exclusive access mechanisms, such as
spinlocks and 
mutexes, which will be problematic to handle.  If the locking rules need to
change as 
part of the patch, it will be difficult to avoid deadlocks.  There is also
an effort to provide ways to fix things up during the patching process
using patch callbacks, though that functionality will need to be used with
some care. 
</p>

<p>
There are lots of traps in verifying that the patches created will still be
within the consistency model; certain things just may not fit.  That is
currently verified through inspection and reasoning; a <a
href="https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md">guide
for patch authors</a> has been started to help with that as well.  There is
a lot 
of work being done on tooling to help tame the combinatorial explosion that
comes from different optimizations that GCC 
will perform.  For example, GCC can change the ABI for functions if it
knows about all of the callers, so patches to those functions cannot be
handled (or the GCC
<tt>-fipr-ra</tt> option must not be used).  Many of those kinds of
problems could 
be detected automatically, Kosina said.
</p>

<p>
Kprobes are another tricky area.  It is difficult to switch an existing
kprobe to a new function, which may cause some surprises.  There is also an
inability to patch hand-written assembly code; Ftrace is not able to work
with that code.  User-space live patching is something that could perhaps be
done, but is much more difficult.  For one thing, user-space applications
are often built with tools other than GCC, which expands the problem.  In
addition, it is harder to define a checkpoint where the consistency can be
assured. 
</p>

<p>
Kosina answered a few questions after the talk.  The kernel address-space
layout randomization (KASLR) feature has no impact on live patching.
Loadable modules, on the other hand, are not easily handled.  Patching the
on-disk version of the module and causing a reload may be the best
approach.  Module signing also came up; live patches are modules, so if signed
modules are required, the patch itself will need to be signed before it can
be loaded.

I was a user of the AT&amp;T/Lucent Technologies Unix RTR system. It supported live patching, but through a more structured approach. Both kernel code as well as user processes and their shared libraries could be patched. Because of the limitations of 1970's technology, the compiler and automation of patch creation were not as sophisticated as current compiler-based approaches. It still supported some automation, but the approaches are not fully applicable for the multi-core processors of today. But, there are still some useful approaches to be considered.<br>
<p>
1. Code which could be updated had to be compiled using indirect jumps to functions, called transfer vectors. The compiler had a mode which generated this approach. This allowed changing multiple patches concurrently, just by updating the transfer vector. In order to support updating shared libraries, user processes needed to be aware of live patching, and be written as state machines, so that the call tree was known to be unwound relatively frequently. No waiting on long-sleeping calls deep in a function tree was allowed. This approach was only applied to long-running processes which could not be restarted without impacting critical parts of the service. Operator functions, such as system configuration did not support live patching.<br>
<p>
2. Data changes were facilitated by adding spare fields to critical structures, and zeroing the unused data. If a field did not have a growth area, or insufficient growth, live patching became more limited. This also required the user to understand structures, and use the spare fields when changing the code. This approach was generally only used for critical fixes, while annual releases would be more flexible, and was also the time to make sure the spare fields which had been consumed were replenished. New code also had to deal with the possibility that the fields were present but not populated. This sometimes required patches to be deployed in multiple steps, with the first step updating the data structures, and maintaining newly allocated structures properly, with a second patch to change the code to properly use the data structures. Not only did data structures need to support this, but inter-process messaging needed to support new fields, without the overhead of self-describing data formats.<br>
<p>
3. A back-out strategy was in place, in case the change did not work as well in production as it had during testing. A "soak period" was defined, usually of an hour or so, during which the fix could be reverted. Obviously, data structure spare fields would not revert to zero if they had been used, which made the exercise of reapplying a failed fix more challenging.<br>
<p>
4. The patching process also updated the packaging, so that if the process did reboot after the soak period, that the new code would be run.<br>
<p>
5. The entire process was orchestrated, including "temporary patch installation" processes, which atomically switched filesystem pointers to new versions of a file, but only in memory, so that if the system booted, that the entire patch would be backed out automatically. This included the equivalent of yum/apt package installations, so that packages would be atomically applied or backed out. This obviously required support from the filesystem.<br>
<p>
The entire process was somewhat painful, such that some products based on Unix RTR did not implement live patching. But it was used in the most successful program of the time, the 5ESS landline telephone system, which included this approach as part of the strategy which enabled 99.9999% availability. Live patching does not exist in a vacuum. It's there to support some underlying reliability/availability requirements. It's not going to be used to support changing stateless worker processes, as these can easily be replaced. It's also not going to be terribly useful in execution-time critical code if it adds overhead which slows the execution time. It's not necessary to use live patching when the underlying problem is so severe that the system needs to be restarted once per day (or panics at the same frequency), as the fix will add stability, and can be installed the next time the system has downtime. It is useful for long-running systems to address security vulnerabilities or minor feature capabilities, or less-impactful stability issues. Live patching can also be useful when the supplier of a service does not know how the service is being used, such as public or private cloud providers, to avoid the need to impact running VMs to apply a security fix. While being able to live-patch the kernel is valuable, being able to patch long-running user-level code, such as shared libraries in long-running processes or the init process is required to have a complete patching solution.<br>

Nortel used to support live function(subroutine) patching on its wireline switches - a branch (to the new code) was inserted as the first instruction of the old function, while keeping a copy of the old function around just in case you wanted to unpatch. This so long, as there was no alteration to global variables etc. and the changes were restricted to code within the old function. If you needed to fully replace a module binary, you'd that option too, but depending on the type of changes, you might have needed a restart to complete the operation. <br>
<p>
It was a brilliantly conceived debug environment, all supported by an in-house compiler and strongly type-enforced language, complete with tracepoints - things that started appearing on Linux systems much much later. Quite stunning for its times!<br>

The fact that modules are not well-supported is problematical. On highly-modular kernels (such as distribution kernels), many modules, including many of those which cannot be unloaded since your rootfs relies on it, routinely get security or data-corruption fixes: ipv6, ipv4, ext4, btrfs and xfs all spring to mind as very recent and repeated examples.<br>
<p>
I can't help but wonder why the RCU-like strategy used for the core kernel can't work for modules too. There doesn't seem to be anything fundamental stopping it.<br>

The kernel development process is based on trust at many levels — trust in
developers, but also in the infrastructure that supports the community.  In
some cases, that trust may not be entirely deserved; most of us have long
since learned not to trust much of anything that shows up in email, for
example, but developers still generally trust that emailed patches will be what
they appear to be.  In his ongoing effort to bring more security to kernel
development, Konstantin Ryabitsev has proposed <a
href="/ml/workflows/20200226172502.q3fl67ealxsonfgp@chatter.i7.local/">a
patch attestation scheme</a> that could help subsystem maintainers verify
the provenance of the patches showing up in their mailboxes.
<p>
One might wonder why this work is needed at all, given that email
attestation has been widely available for almost exactly as long as the
kernel has existed; Phil Zimmermann first released PGP in 1991.  PGP (and
its successor, GnuPG) have always been painful to use, though, even before
considering their interference with patches and the review process in
particular; PGP-signed mail can require escaping characters or be mangled
by mail transfer agents.  It is safe to say that nobody bothers checking the few PGP
signatures that exist on patches sent via email.
<p>
Ryabitsev's goal is to make attestation easy enough that even busy kernel
developers will be willing to add it to their workflow.  The scheme he has
come up with is, for now, meant for integration with processes that involve
using <tt>git send-email</tt> to send out a set of patches, though it is
not tightly tied to that workflow.  A developer can add attestation to their
process by 
creating a directory full of patches and sending them out via <tt>git
send-email</tt> in the usual manner; attestation is then done as a separate
step, involving an additional email message.
<p>
In particular, the developer will run the <tt>attest-patches</tt> tool
found in Ryabitsev's <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mricon/korg-helpers.git">korg-helpers
repository</a>.  It will look at each patch and split it into three
components:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Some patch metadata: specifically the author's name and email address,
     along with the subject line.
<li> The commit message.
<li> The patch itself.
</ul>
<p>
The tool will use <tt>sha256sum</tt> to create a separate SHA-256 checksum
for each of the three components.  The three checksums are then joined, in
an abbreviated form, to create a sort of unique ID for the patch that
looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    2a02abe0-215cf3f1-2acb5798
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>attest-patches</tt> tool creates a file containing this
"attestation ID", along with the full checksums for all three components:
<p>
<pre>
    2a02abe0-215cf3f1-2acb5798:
      i: 2a02abe02216f626105622aee2f26ab10c155b6442e23441d90fc5fe4071b86e
      m: 215cf3f133478917ad147a6eda1010a9c4bba1846e7dd35295e9a0081559e9b0
      p: 2acb5798c366f97501f8feacb873327bac161951ce83e90f04bbcde32e993865
</pre>
<p>
A block like this is generated for each patch given to
<tt>attest-patches</tt>.  The result happens to be a file in the YAML
format, but one can live in ignorance of that fact without ill effect.  The
file is then passed to GnuPG for signing.  The
final step is to email this file to <tt>signatures@kernel.org</tt>, where
it will appear on a public mailing list; <tt>attest-patches</tt> can
perform this step automatically.
<p>
On the receiving end, a reviewer or subsystem maintainer runs <a
href="/Articles/811528/"><tt>get-lore-mbox</tt></a> with the <tt>-aA</tt>
options; <tt>-A</tt> does not actually exist yet but one assumes it will
appear shortly.  As the tool creates a mailbox file suitable for feeding to
<tt>git&nbsp;am</tt>, it will verify the attestation for each of the
patches it finds.  That is done by generating its own attestation ID for
each patch, then using that ID to search for messages on the
<tt>signatures</tt> mailing list.  If any messages are found, the full checksum
for each of the three patch components is checked.  The GPG signature in
the file is also checked, of course.
<p>
If the checks pass — meaning that an applicable signature message exists, the
checksums match the patches in question, and the message is signed by a
developer known to the recipient — then <tt>get-lore-mbox</tt> will create
the requested mailbox file, adding a couple of tags to each patch
describing the attestation that was found.  Otherwise the tool will abort
after describing where things went wrong.
<p>
A test run of the system has already been done; Kees Cook generated <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/signatures/202002251425.E7847687B@keescook/">an
attestation message</a> for <a
href="/ml/kernel-hardening/20200225051307.6401-1-keescook@chromium.org/">this
patch series</a>.  He <a
href="/ml/workflows/202002260938.BFA7FA03@keescook/">said</a> that this
mechanism would be "<q>utterly trivial</q>" to add to his normal
patch-generation workflow.
<p>
Jason Donenfeld, instead, <a
href="/ml/workflows/20200227041144.GA36493@zx2c4.com/">was unconvinced</a>
of the value of this infrastructure.  He argued that "<q>maintainers
should be reading commits as they come in on the mailing list</q>" and
that attestation would make the contribution process harder.  He asked:
"<q>is the lack of signatures on email patches a real problem we're
facing?</q>"
<p>
Ryabitsev <a
href="/ml/workflows/20200227142935.4ulyjoodgyeu4uoz@chatter.i7.local/">responded</a>
that he saw this mechanism as addressing two specific threats:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> An "<q>overworked, tired maintainer</q>" may be tempted to
     perform cursory reviews of patches from trusted developers;
     attestation at least lets them know that those patches actually came
     from their alleged author.
<li> Maintainers might diligently review patches arriving in email, then
     use a tool like <tt>get-lore-mbox</tt> to fetch those patches for easy
     application.  If lore.kernel.org has been compromised, it could return
     a modified form of those patches and the maintainer may well never
     notice.  Once again, attestation should block any such attack.
</ul>
<p>
He ended with a hope that the process he has developed is easy enough that
developers will actually use it.
<p>
Whether that will actually happen remains to be seen.  The use of signed
tags on pull requests is still far from universal, despite the fact that
they, too, are easy to generate and Linus Torvalds requires them for
repositories not hosted on kernel.org.  Based on past discussions, it seems
unlikely that Torvalds will require attestation for emailed patches.  So if
patch attestation is to become widespread in the kernel community, it will
be as a result of lower-level maintainers deciding that it makes sense.  Of
course, a successful attack could change attitudes quickly.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One problem with this is the immense size and overhead of pgp signatures, which makes them kind of impractical to use. Modern tools like minisign generate signatures that are small enough to fit on one line. However, I'm afraid many people unfortunately won't switch away from pgp very soon.<br>

I do agree with Jason in this regard. It will certainly make "unnecessarily" complicate the matter. It might be a good idea, but certainly, disrupt and kick away lots of people from contributing. <br>
<p>
Well, if you insist, sooner or later it will get under the hood. Kai, this is not criticizing, but it might be easy for a few people, think about the rest.<br>

      The proposed mechanism seems surprisingly convoluted for its intended purpose.
<p>
It would be simpler to add some sort of <tt>--sign-with</tt> option to <tt>git send-email</tt>, and some sort of <tt>--require-signature-from</tt> option to <tt>git am</tt>, and use e-mail PGP/MIME (or S/MIME, i don't really care) cryptographic signatures.
<p>
Then users could add the appropriate options to their git config and move on with their existing workflow.
<p>
One legitimate concern with this counter-proposal is that the "patch metadata" won't be automatically covered by the signature.  This has been a long-standing flaw in cryptographic e-mail signatures, but it has a very simple resolution (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers-02.html">replicating the relevant e-mail headers inside the cryptographic payload</a>), which is already in use by multiple e-mail clients.

Can I suggest that the person compiling the kernel, as well as the maintainer, should be an enduser of patch attestation?  I think it's reasonable for a person compiling the kernel to be able to be able to ask "were any the patches contributing to this kernel altered from those patches the developer intended to send?"<br>

There are (rare) occasions where the maintainer alters the patches when he applies them, this would complicate that step.<br>
<p>
The whole thing relies on the signature sent to a certain mailing list.<br>
Can't a rogue patch sender also sign and send to that signature mailing list?<br>

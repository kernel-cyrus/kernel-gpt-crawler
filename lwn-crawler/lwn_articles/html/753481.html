<p>
In a short filesystem-only discussion at the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM), Jérôme Glisse wanted to
talk about some (more) changes to support GPUs, FPGAs, and RDMA devices.
In <a href="/Articles/752564/">other talks at LSFMM</a>, he discussed
changes to <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> 
in support of these kinds of devices, but here he was looking to discuss
other changes 
to support mapping a device's memory into multiple processes.  It should be
noted that I had a hard time following the discussion in this session, so
there may be significant gaps in what follows.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/753479/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/lsf-glisse-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Jérôme Glisse]" title="Jérôme Glisse" width=223 height=280>
</a>

<p>
A device driver stores the device context in the <tt>private_data</tt>
field of the <tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt>, Glisse said, which has worked well,
but is now becoming a problem.  There are new devices that developers want
to be able to attach to an <tt>mm_struct</tt>.  In addition, though, those
devices are still being used by a legacy API that needs to be preserved.
</p>

<p>
Glisse said that his first idea was to associate the device context with
an <tt>mm_struct</tt>.  That led to various developers to try to better
understand the use case.  Ted Ts'o summarized what came out of that.  He
suggested that what Glisse wanted was for every <tt>mm_struct</tt> to have
a unique ID associated with it and to store that unique ID in the device
context.  Any <tt>ioctl()</tt> that tried to access the device would only
work if the unique ID in the <tt>mm_struct</tt> of the caller is the same
as that buried in the device context.  Glisse agreed that would do what he
was aiming for.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o noted that you can't use the address of the <tt>mm_struct</tt> because
that would vary between processes.  It wouldn't necessarily be implemented
as a unique ID, he said, but that is conceptually how it would work.  Kent
Overstreet suggested a simple global sequence number for
<tt>mm_struct</tt>.  Processes that shared them would have the same
sequence number, so the <tt>ioctl()</tt> enforcement could be done.
</p>

<p>
After questions about where the changes might lie, Glisse said that he had
not written any code yet, but that he did not think changes to the virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer would be required.  VFS maintainer Al Viro did not
really think it mattered where the changes would be made, his question was
whether the behavior is needed.  Glisse said that it is; it will allow
the legacy code to continue running on GPUs, while allowing for more modern
uses of the devices going forward.

Argh, I missed this session. Thanks for writing this up, Jake!<br>
<p>
I have a preliminary patch to use an IDR to assign each mm_struct a u32 ID. There are various details around how quickly those can be reused. It actually saves memory (replacing the list_head with a u32). I'll try to get that finished up soon.<br>

Ironically, the documentation you linked to doesn't explain either what IDR or IDA are short for.<br>

I miss Byte magazine, which meticulously spelled out an acronym the first time it appeared in an article, no matter how common. For example: "Random Access Memory (RAM)".<br>

IBM used to do that in all its manuals as well, and it's an irritating style because acronyms are not abbreviations - they're words in their own right that are better known and have more meaning than the words from which they are derived.  Sometimes the acquired meanings even contradict those words.  The etymology of the acronym is still useful, of course, but the right way to do it is RAM (Random Access Memory), not Random Access Memory (RAM).
<p>
RAM is an interesting example, by the way, because words used illogically was another peeve Byte editors had and the magazine never used RAM to mean what most people meant by it: read/write memory.  The term in Byte for that was "programmable memory."  RAM would appear in Byte only in contrast with sequential access memory.

What is this for exactly? There have been other discussions about representing memory provided by an nvme drive with struct page structures. Is that the use-case? or is it more for things like HMM?<br>

This sounds like yet another darn global id that someone is going to make visible to userspace<br>
and then it will need to get namespaced and then it's utility for device drivers will be gone.<br>
<p>
So be very careful and don't even consider making something like this visible to userspace unless you intend to make it globally unique and even then hesitate and make absolutely certain that is what you want.<br>

This isn't about this specific post, but it had to go somewhere: Thanks for the LFSMM coverage. Almost all the articles so far have been highly interesting.<br>

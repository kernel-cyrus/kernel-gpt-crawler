           </div>
Traffic on the kernel mailing lists often seems to follow a particular
theme.  At the moment, one of those themes is memory management.  What
follows is an overview of these patches, 
hopefully giving an idea of what the memory management developers are up
to.
<P>
<h4>MADV_WILLWRITE</h4>
<p>

Normally, developers expect that a write to file-backed memory will execute
quickly.  That data must eventually find its way back to persistent
storage, but the kernel usually handles that in the background while the
application continues running.  Andy Lutomirski has discovered that things
don't always work that way, though.  In particular, if the memory is backed
by a file that has never been written (even if it has been extended to the
requisite size with <tt>fallocate()</tt>), the first write to each page of that
memory can be quite slow, due to the filesystem's need to allocate on-disk
blocks, mark the block as being initialized, and otherwise get ready to
accept the data.  If (as is the case with 
Andy's application) there is a need to write multiple gigabytes of data,
the slowdown can be considerable.

<p>
One way to work around this problem is to write throwaway data to that memory
before getting into the time-sensitive part of the application, essentially
forcing the kernel to prepare the backing store.  That approach works, but
at the cost of writing large amounts of useless data to disk; it might be
nice to have something a bit more elegant than that.
<p>
Andy's <a href="/Articles/562213/">answer</a> is to add a new operation,
<tt>MADV_WILLWRITE</tt>, to the <tt>madvise()</tt> system call.  Within the
kernel, that call is passed to a new <tt>vm_operations_struct</tt>
operation:
<p>
<pre>
    long (*willwrite)(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long start, 
		      unsigned long end);
</pre>
<p>
In the current implementation, only the ext4 filesystem provides support
for this operation; it responds by reserving blocks so that the upcoming
write can complete quickly.  Andy notes that there is a lot more that could
be done 
to fully prepare for an upcoming write, including performing the
copy-on-write needed for private mappings, actually allocating pages of
memory, and so on.  For the time being, though, the patch is intended as a
proof of concept and a request for comments.
<p>
<h4>Controlling transparent huge pages</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge pages</a> feature uses
huge pages whenever possible, and without user-space awareness, in order to
improve memory access performance.  Most of the time the result is faster
execution, but there are some workloads that can perform worse when
transparent huge pages are enabled.  The feature can be turned off
globally, but what about situations where some applications benefit while
others do not?
<p>
Alex Thorlton's <a href="/Articles/562034/">answer</a> is to provide an
option to disable transparent huge pages on a per-process basis.  It takes
the form of a new operation (<tt>PR_SET_THP_DISABLED</tt>) to the
<tt>prctl()</tt> system call.  This operation sets a flag in the
<tt>task_struct</tt> structure; setting that flag causes the memory
management system to avoid using huge pages for the associated process.
And that allows the creation of mixed workloads, where some processes use
transparent huge pages and others do not.
<p>
<h4>Transparent huge page cache</h4>
<p>
Since their inception, transparent huge pages have only worked with
anonymous memory; there is no support for file-backed (page cache) pages.
For some time now, Kirill A. Shutemov has been working on a <a
href="/Articles/562117/">transparent huge page cache</a> implementation to
fix that problem.  The latest version, a 23-patch set, shows how complex
the problem is.
<p>
In this version, Kirill's patch has a number of limitations.  Unlike the
anonymous page implementation, the transparent huge page cache code is
unable to create huge pages by coalescing small pages.  It also, crucially,
is unable to create huge pages in response to page faults, so it does not
currently work well with files mapped into a process's address space; that
problem is slated to be fixed in a future patch set.  The current
implementation only works with the ramfs filesystem â€” not, perhaps, the
filesystem that users were clamoring for most loudly.  But the <a
href="/Articles/562214/">ramfs implementation</a> is a good proof of
concept; it also shows that, with the appropriate infrastructure in place,
the amount of filesystem-specific code needed to support huge pages in the
page cache is relatively small.
<p>
One thing that is still missing is a good set of benchmark results showing
that the transparent huge page cache speeds things up.  Since this is
primarily a performance-oriented patch set, such results are important.
The <tt>mmap()</tt> implementation is also important, but the patch set is
already a large chunk of code in its current form.
<p>
<a name="oom"></a>
<h4>Reliable out-of-memory handling</h4>
<p>
As was described in <a href="/Articles/552789/">this June 2013 article</a>,
the kernel's out-of-memory (OOM) killer has some inherent
reliability problems.  A process may have called deeply into the kernel by
the time it
encounters an OOM condition; when that happens, it is put on hold while
the kernel tries to make some memory available.  That process may be
holding no end of locks, possibly including locks needed to enable a
process hit by 
the OOM killer to exit and release its memory; that means that deadlocks
are relatively likely once the system goes into an OOM state.
<p>
Johannes Weiner has posted <a href="/Articles/562091/">a set of patches</a>
aimed at improving this situation.  Following a bunch of cleanup work,
these patches make two fundamental changes to how OOM conditions are
handled in the kernel.  The first of those is perhaps the most visible: it
causes the kernel to avoid calling the OOM killer altogether for most
memory allocation failures.  In particular, if the allocation is being made
in response to a system call, the kernel will just cause the system call to
fail with an <tt>ENOMEM</tt> error rather than trying to find a process to
kill.  That may cause system call failures to happen more often and in
different contexts than they used to.  But, naturally, that will not be a
problem since all user-space code diligently checks the return status of
every system call and responds with well-tested error-handling code when
things go wrong.
<p>
The other change happens more deeply within the kernel.  When a process
incurs a page fault, the kernel really only has two choices: it must either
provide a valid page at the faulting address or kill the process in
question.  So the OOM killer will still be invoked in response to memory
shortages encountered when trying to handle a page fault.  But the code has
been reworked somewhat; rather than wait for the OOM killer deep within the
page fault handling code, the kernel drops back out and releases all locks
first.  Once the OOM killer has done its thing, the page fault is restarted
from the beginning.  This approach should ensure reliable page fault
handling while avoiding the locking problems that plague the OOM killer
now.
<p>
<h4>Logging drop_caches</h4>
<p>
Writing to the magic sysctl file <tt>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</tt> will
cause the kernel to forget about all clean objects in the page, dentry, and
inode caches.  That is not normally something one would want to do; those
caches are maintained to improve the performance of the system.  But
clearing the caches can be useful 
for memory management testing and for the production of reproducible
filesystem benchmarks.  Thus, <tt>drop_caches</tt> exists primarily as a
debugging and testing tool.
<p>
It seems, though, that some system administrators have put writes to
<tt>drop_caches</tt> into various scripts over the years in the belief that
it somehow helps performance.  Instead, they often end up creating
performance problems that would not otherwise be there.  Michal Hocko, it
seems, has gotten a little tired of tracking down this kind of problem, so
he has <a href="/Articles/562215/">revived an old patch from Dave
Hansen</a> that causes a message to be logged whenever <tt>drop_caches</tt>
is used.  He said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I am bringing the patch up again because this has proved being
	really helpful when chasing strange performance issues which
	(surprise surprise) turn out to be related to artificially dropped
	caches done because the admin thinks this would help... So mostly
	those who support machines which are not in their hands would
	benefit from such a change.
</div>
<p>
As always, the simplest patches cause the most discussion.  In this case, a
number of developers expressed concern that administrators would not
welcome the additional log noise, especially if they are using
<tt>drop_caches</tt> frequently.  But Dave <a
href="/Articles/562216/">expressed a hope</a> that at least some of the
affected users would get in contact with the kernel developers and explain
why they feel the need to use <tt>drop_caches</tt> frequently.  If it is
being used to paper over memory management bugs, the thinking goes, it
would be better to fix those bugs directly.
<p>
In the end, if this patch is merged, it is likely to include an option (the
value written to <tt>drop_caches</tt> is already a bitmask) to suppress the
log message.  That led to another discussion on exactly which bit should be
used, or whether the <tt>drop_caches</tt> interface should be augmented to
understand keywords instead.  As of this writing, the simple
<tt>printk()</tt> statement still has not been added; perhaps more
discussion is required.

I can't really see why dropping already cached pages would be helpful, but when working with large files which you will scan sequentially, it is useful to stop the newly read pages being cached.  (If the file is bigger than memory, then by the time you get to the end of the file the start of it is no longer in cache, so you have to read it all over again next time.  So caching doesn't give any performance benefit, and it would be better to use that memory for other things.)<br>
<p>
Is there an option to open a file and specify that newly read pages should not be added to the cache?<br>

POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL?  I don't think that does what the previous poster asked but I've been surprised by what the various fadvise flags _actually_ do before.  POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE sounds like it might avoid caching pages but the man page I'm looking at claims that in 2.6.18+ it is a no-op.<br>
<p>
I am certain that POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED drops pages from the page cache but it doesn't work for future pages.  In other words you have to periodically call it on pages you've previously read or have written which is somewhat annoying.  The other gotcha for writes is that POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED doesn't drop dirty pages from the page cache it only initiates writeback so you have to call it twice for each possibly dirty page range if you really want those pages dropped.  I currently use this for write-once files or files that I know will no longer be in the page cache by the next time I'm going to need them. <br>

      I don't know exactly what Linux's current page replacement policy is, but this problem of sequential read of a file too big to fit in cache pushing other stuff out of cache as it goes, called a cache sweep, was solved long ago.  The kernel should detect that this is happening and stop caching that file before it does much harm, and I presume that it does.  That would explain why Linux doesn't do anything special with POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE.
<p>
I know that even before modern cache sweep protection was invented, Linux avoided much of the pain by using version of second-chance, so that these pages, since they were referenced only once, would be the first to be evicted and most of the pages that would actually be referenced again would remain.

I'm _not_ a user who calls drop_caches to solve my problems, but I've surely been tempted to do it.  If you rarely read back any files or when you do read you don't care about read performance then caching file pages hurts the performance of the things you do care about.  As an example we have systems that simply log several hundreds of GB of data during the day, and that data is backed up in the evenings.  The page cache is essentially useless on these machines since most of the files are bigger than RAM and we really don't care about the read performance as long as the old data is off before the next day starts.  On the other hand we do care about write performance/latency and as soon as the page cache fills up you can start experiencing write stalls as old pages are dropped and new pages are allocated.  <br>

I am such a user, but my problem is to check that the device that i have just written (FLASH storage partition) has been correctly written (i.e. the FLASH device driver worked) - so I want to really read back from the FLASH partition and compare to what it should be (and see if there are uncorrected read errors)...<br>
It would be nice to have an interface to drop the cache on a single device...<br>

Would "-o remount,ro" work? Unmounting might be a little too disruptive. Of course, I'm not sure what happens when the filesystem behind a rw file I'm using gets remounted ro? Is it still writeable until I close it? Hit the next block? Delay the remount?<br>

      <p>Switching a filesystem image read-only <em>cleans</em> the cache, but does not purge it.  Thus, when you next read the file and see the correct data, that is no proof that the kernel correctly wrote to the device, which is what the OP wants.  For that, you need to purge the cache and then read.

<p>As for what happens when you switch to read-only while writing to a file is in progress:  The mount() system call to switch to read-only fails.  It fails if any file is open for writing.
<p>
And I'll tell you when else it fails, which causes no end of pain: when there's an unlinked file (a file not in any directory) in the filesystem.  Because the kernel must update the filesystem when the file eventually closes (because it must delete the file at that time), the kernel cannot allow the switch to r/o.

No, because the partition is not mounted.<br>
On most embedded systems, you have two set of each partitions, and you update the whole unused partition by copying the device itself (that device image may contain a filesystem or just a CPIO or just a binary file like an image of the data to initialise the FPGA or the image of Linux kernel (U-boot cannot read filesystem content)).<br>
So you copy the whole partition, check that there is no error writing, drop the cache, read it back and check there is no error reading, and check the checksum/SHA1 of the whole partition.<br>
Unlike a PC there isn't any software recovery in case of failure, no expensive (in terms of PCB space) recovery FLASH, the only recovery is to plug an external JTAG adapter and it is slow.<br>
Most cards I use have two U-boot, all of them have two Device Tree.<br>

<p>
One good reason is because then you don't get all the benefits of caching.  There's a good reason systems normally write through the buffer/cache, and it probably applies here: you want the kernel to be able to choose the order and size of writes to the device, independent of the order and size of writes by the application.  For speed and such.
<p>
But I remember using an ioctl(BLKFLSBUF) to purge just the cache of a particular device, for speed testing; that's a lot less reckless than dropping every cached piece of information from the entire system.  I wonder if that still works.

Do you care about the performance of open()? Then don't drop the caches because it drops the dentry cache too so the kernel will have to hit the disk for every directory in your path.<br>

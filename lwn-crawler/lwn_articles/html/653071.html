Over the past few years, two big trends forged the need for a completely
new kernel 
display driver interface.  On one hand, people stopped appreciating partial
redrawing and windows torn to pieces when anything changed in their GUI. New
compositors like Wayland have been created with the slogan that "every frame is
perfect". On the other hand, there are battery-powered phones and tablets with
fancy graphical interfaces, but serious limits on power consumption. And that
brought along an explosion of special-purpose display hardware to help out the
rather power-hungry, but more general purpose, GPU in compositing screen
contents. Bringing these trends together yields the need to update a lot of
display 
hardware state in an all-or-nothing, atomic manner to ensure every frame is
perfect and all the power-usage-optimized hardware is used as much as
possible. </p>

After a few years of development, the atomic display update <tt>ioctl()</tt>
for Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) drivers
is finally ready for prime time with the <a
	href="http://mid.mail-archive.com/alpine.DEB.2.00.1506260158440.13786@skynet.skynet.ie">4.2
	pull request from Dave Airlie</a>. It's been a long road, with a lot of
drivers <a
 href="http://blog.ffwll.ch/2014/11/atomic-modeset-support-for-kms-drivers.html">already
 converted over to atomic</a> and even more in progress, and the <a
 href="http://blog.ffwll.ch/2015/01/update-for-atomic-display-updates.html">atomic
 helper libraries and support code</a> in the DRM subsystem sufficiently
 polished. But what's really missing is a design overview of what the overall
 atomic infrastructure looks like and why some decisions and details are
 implemented the way they are.

<p>
This article, which is first of the two articles in a series, will start
with a recap of the history of kernel display mode-setting support to
explain how the older interfaces came to be and why they're no longer
suitable. It will then look at out-of-tree solutions and finally cover what
the merged atomic display update interface looks like. The second article
will delve deeper into some of the details of the implementation.</p>

<p>
Before digging into all the details, a quick overview over how display hardware
is represented today in the DRM subsystem is needed. First there is <tt>struct&nbsp;drm_connector</tt> which represents a screen, whether that's an
integrated panel or an external screen. Note that connectors can be hot-plugged
nowadays, since DisplayPort supports branching and multiplexing of multiple devices
over one cable, similar to other peripheral buses. At the other end there's
<tt>struct&nbsp;drm_plane</tt>, representing a scanout engine that reads pixel data
from memory represented by a <tt>struct&nbsp;drm_framebuffer</tt> and provides it to
the display hardware.

<p>
To allow drivers to
support hardware features beyond what's possible with the core control
data for each object, DRM supports properties that can be attached to
any DRM object. There are different types of properties that accept
different inputs like enumerations (e.g. for selecting between upscaling modes
like pillarbox or letterbox) or integer ranges (e.g. for brightness control).

<p>
With fancy hardware, a plane can be freely positioned in
the output rectangle, scaled or otherwise adjusted. Both ends are tied together
with a <tt>struct&nbsp;drm_crtc</tt> which represents a display pipeline.
Note that CRTC means "cathode ray tube controller" and hence is one of
those abbreviations that only make historical sense.
Multiple
planes can be connected to a single CRTC to provide it with input data, and such a display pipeline
then, in turn, connects to one or more <tt>drm_connector</tt>s to actually show something on
screens. Besides being the central object for routing, a CRTC also keeps track of
other settings like the display mode (i.e. refresh rate and resolution) used by
the display pipeline and the background color that should be shown where no plane is
visible at all.
</p>

<h4>
The old world — A pile of <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands and properties</h4>

<p>
There's a much better and detailed <a
 href="http://ppaalanen.blogspot.ch/2014/06/from-pre-history-to-beyond-global.html">writeup</a>
 of the mode-setting history around, so I'll just focus on the more recent bits.
 The new age of display drivers in the kernel started in earnest almost
 seven years 
 ago with the initial merge of the <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f453ba0460742ad027ae0c4c7d61e62817b3e7ef">KMS
 (kernel mode setting) support</a>. Well, there was always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer">fbdev</a>, but that
 subsystem never gained dearly needed support for proper graphics memory
 management, didn't have a clean separation between display and rendering, and never
 solved a host of other 
 troubles.

<p>
Initial KMS <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands were modeled after X's user-space mode-setting
 protocol <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR/">XRandR</a>,
 which means they were good enough to set modes on screens
 individually and connect a single primary framebuffer object (representing a
 driver-specific memory buffer) with that display. This was all designed when
 rotating desktop cubes were all the rage and everyone wanted to use the 3D
 rendering engine for desktop compositing only — old-style video overlay
 planes seriously
 fell out of favor (you can't wobble them!) and hence weren't supported at
 all.</p>

<p>
Well, there was one exception: cursor support.


But that was just a bolted-on <tt>ioctl()</tt> that didn't even use the KMS
framebuffer abstraction.
And cursor updates couldn't be synced to anything,
neither primary framebuffer updates nor the vertical blank — X didn't
need it and couldn't use it. Without synchronizing to the vertical
blanking (Vsync for short), the screen redrawing can race with the
update and result in ugly tearing effects.
 Later on <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d91d8a3f88059d93e34ac70d059153ec69a9ffc7">non-blocking
 updates for the primary plane</a> were added to have support for proper
 Vsynced, 
 non-tearing updates of the primary plane.</p>

<p>
Of course, then smartphones and tablets showed up, so it wasn't cool to
blow through power for display anymore.  Suddenly overlay planes became
important 
again since they're much more power-efficient in some narrow but popular
use cases
like video playback. KMS gained support for them in the form of <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8cf5c9177151537e73ff1816540e4ba24b174391">additional
 plane objects</a> and a new set of <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands.

<p>
But, like cursor updates, plane updates couldn't be synced to anything
else, neither plane updates nor Vsync, again because X couldn't do
more and nothing else cared about upstream graphics.
The
 result was a mess of three 
 different <tt>ioctl()</tt> interfaces for essentially just different instances of the
 same hardware. Planes, whether primary, cursor, or overlay, all take a
 framebuffer object that then all get blended together somehow, before being fed
 to a display pipeline (represented by a CRTC object in kernel mode setting),
 which feeds the connectors and panels. <a
 href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/commit/?id=2844ea3f252331cc0ecf3ae74f6226db2f580f8a">
	 Unifying the plane interfaces</a> was fairly
 simple: primary and cursor planes simply had to be exported as such,
 optionally, in order to not confuse existing user space.</p>

<p>
But there was still no unified  <tt>ioctl()</tt> that could do it all; for example, only the primary
plane supported non-blocking updates with precise completion events. And there
was no interface to update multiple planes together — user space had to make
multiple <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls and hope that the updates all happened in the same frame.
That's obviously a no-go for modern compositors like Wayland that want to
guarantee pixel-perfect updates for every frame.</p>

<p>
The other thing that happened is adding property support to all KMS objects to
easily expose additional features like controlling the blending between planes,
setting a background color, or rotating planes or the entire output. Of course,
that was again done with a separate <tt>ioctl()</tt>. And, again, because X couldn't do any
better back when this was introduced, there's no way to synchronize updates.
Which means broken updates become ever more likely, as, for example when the
rotation value is already updated but the
plane contents aren't yet updated to match. If it's possible at all —
some values can only be changed together or in a specific order, like disabling
an additional plane before switching the primary one to a more memory-bandwidth-demanding mode.</p>

<p>
It was all a mess and in dire need of a solution. </p>
<p>

<h4>
Android's Atomic Display Framework</h4>

<p>
Outside of upstream graphics, especially in Android-land, the situation was even
worse. Every GPU vendor had its own kernel/user-space interfaces and all the
drivers were reinventing the same wheels, but broken in slightly different
ways. Google was unhappy about the state of things and created  the <a
 href="/Articles/565422/">Atomic Display Framework</a> (ADF). It was inspired a bit by the
 upstream kernel mode-setting support, but was a completely new subsystem
 otherwise. For our tour, the overall design isn't useful to look at, but it's
 interesting to look at where ADF fell short for upstream use:</p>

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li>ADF supports only one update queue for the entire device. That's a perfect
	fit for Android's SurfaceFlinger, which just has one draw loop, and
	it's totally sufficient for phones and tablets where, in most cases, you only
ever have one screen. But if you have multiple screens, which usually run at
slightly different refresh rates, then one update queue isn't enough. You have
to either stall the faster screen or drop frames on the slower one, both of
which will result in not-perfectly-smooth animations. The non-blocking primary
plane updates in upstream are already fully decoupled and compositors like
Wayland already have per-output redraw loops. This was a big
omission from ADF.</li>

<li>ADF describes atomic updates in a driver-specific blob of data. That's fine
	for Android where you have a GPU-specific counterpart driver in
	user space behind the Hardware Composer interface (similar to an X device
driver like xf86-video-intel). But upstream also wants to support generic
user-space compositors like Wayland or the xf86-video-modesetting X
driver. ADF has a generic interface for updates, but it's only really good
enough for a simple boot splash. Of course there will always be some features
specific to one driver, but by standardizing properties across drivers, upstream
DRM already has the infrastructure to support arbitrary functionality in
	generic user-space code.</li>

<li>ADF was only atomic for plane updates and not for reconfiguring the output
	routing. Again, this is not a problem if you only really care about the
	single-screen case, but on modern GPUs there are lots of shared
	resources 
when using more than one output. And the naive way of reconfiguring by just
looping over all outputs can easily end up in a state that isn't supported
	by the hardware,
	for example
because the driver ran out of display clock generators for the interim
configuration. Hence atomic updates for the entire pipeline across all outputs
was definitely needed in upstream. More important was some means to figure
out whether a change would work out or not before applying it and risking being
stuck with a black screen.</li>

<li>ADF was implemented as a <a
 href="/Articles/336262/">monolithic mid-layer subsystem</a>.
 That's great if your goal is to improve the state of the art for 90% of all
 drivers and a real pain if your driver is one of the 10% where the mid-layer
 just doesn't fit. Despite some horror shows in some upstream DRM legacy
 subsystems, the mode-setting part is nicely structured by exposing the
 full interface 
 from the <tt>ioctl()</tt> to the driver hooks and providing a big helper library for all
 the common cases. Definitely something to keep.</li>

<li>ADF also has a completely new user-space ABI and driver interface, which
	would mean separate drivers for everything. Not desirable from a
	backward compatibility and maintenance point of view.</li>
</ul>

Of course solving these problems isn't all that easy. The following sections in this
article and the next one will look at some of them in more
detail and describe how it's done in the atomic support that was merged.</p>

<h4>
A generic driver interface that's actually useful</h4>

<p>
Since DRM already has properties, it was fairly clear to reuse them as the
generic transport for the user-space ABI. User space simply supplies a list of
<tt> (object_id, property_id, value) </tt> triples. And that immediately
takes care of extensibility — user space that doesn't understand a given
property just doesn't ever change it. As long as a driver initializes everything
to something sane (like setting the rotation property to unrotated) then older
generic user space will keep on working when new features get added.

<p>
Of course
there were some gaps with that plan — properties for all the existing metadata
had to be added, with a special flag to only expose them to atomic-aware
user space.
A new property type has been created that accepts
kernel mode-setting objects as values to set up routing links. And a
few other bits needed adjustments, like extending blob properties to
make them usable for atomic updates.
</p>

<p>
Allowing partial updates also solved the in-kernel backward compatibility
problem: All the old KMS <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands did partial updates, only allowing full updates
would have meant that drivers needed to support both legacy and atomic
interfaces. With partial atomic update support, legacy driver hooks can instead
be implemented in terms of the atomic driver entry points in a generic helper
library.</p>

<p>
Finally, there was the question of exposing hardware and driver limitations to
user space. There are many of those, and every time a new property is
standardized it becomes more complex. Trying to describe constraints explicitly
was quickly discarded as impossible; the only thing the kernel can do is reject
requests for impossible states (or even just transitions, as sometimes that's the
limiting factor). But that would require driver-specific user space, rendering all
the effort with a generic interface moot.

<p>
Instead, the atomic <tt>ioctl()</tt> supports a
<tt>DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY</tt> flag to not actually commit the update to the
hardware. With this, generic user space can build up the state it wants
step-by-step using some heuristics and test each
time around whether the update will still work, until it's found the maximal
configuration.
For
example, a compositor could add planes one-by-one in order of
preference of what would save the most power when using a hardware
plane to compose a given client buffer onto the screen and then fall
back to using OpenGL for any remaining client buffers.
It can then queue the real update once everything is
ready with the 
assurance that it will work out. Assuming no bugs in drivers, of
course. This way, 
generic user space can use hardware with really strange restrictions, without
explicitly describing those restrictions in the interface. Of course it
won't always make a perfect 
decision, but in most cases it will be good enough.</p>

<p>
This was all settled fairly quickly and, except for some cosmetics, the upstream
atomic user-space ABI has stayed unchanged since the <a
 href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/dri-devel/msg24399.html">first RFC</a>
  was floated about three
 years ago. The big question that took a few years to settle was
 the core-to-driver interface. Just passing the same list of triples to drivers
 would have been easiest and was done for proof-of-concept
 implementations. But that would have 
 meant a brittle and verbose interface for in-kernel users, and for the
 final atomic support there would be a lot of those to handle all the legacy
 <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands
 and legacy users like fbdev emulation. Simply passing decoded structures
 around,  like
 with the old hooks, wasn't an option either because of the need for
 driver-private extensions and partial updates.</p>

<p>
The currently merged solution is quite a bit of a beast. First there are generic
state structures for each type of mode-setting object that you can assign
properties for.  The state structure for planes, for example, is:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    struct drm_plane_state {
	struct drm_plane *plane;

	struct drm_crtc *crtc;
	struct drm_framebuffer *fb;

	/* Signed dest location allows it to be partially off screen */
	int32_t crtc_x, crtc_y;
	uint32_t crtc_w, crtc_h;

	/* ... */

	struct drm_atomic_state *state;
    };
</pre>

<p>
Every state structure has a pointer to the object the state is for. Then follows
all the object-specific KMS state decoded into the
kernel-internal representations.
 For planes, this is a pointer to the CRTC (which
represents a display pipeline) the plane is attached to, and a pointer to the
framebuffer it should scan out, the position of the plane on the display window,
and a few other things left out for clarity. And, finally, a backpointer to a
<tt>drm_atomic_state</tt> structure. This keeps track of all the various
per-object states of an update, allowing partial updates at the object level.

<p>
When an update finally gets committed, a pointer to the state is stored in each
object, here for planes that would be <tt>plane-&gt;state</tt>. When committing
states, the <tt>plane-&gt;state-&gt;state</tt> backpointer is also cleared since,
once committed, the state structure is owned by the driver and no longer
owned by 
the update structure itself.</p>

<p>
Partial updates within an object are done by duplicating the existing state. And
support for driver-private extensions is handled by allowing drivers to embed
<tt>struct&nbsp;drm_plane_state</tt> into their own structures. That means
there's an <tt>-&gt;atomic_duplicate_state()</tt> hook with a default
implementation like <tt>drm_atomic_helper_plane_duplicate_state()</tt>.
Since a few of the objects pointed at by state structures are reference counted
(like framebuffers), there's also a <tt>-&gt;atomic_destroy_state()</tt> hook
to clean everything up. For all the hooks there's a default implementation even
when there's not yet a need for it — that way it's easy to standardize the
handling of some properties by moving them from driver-specific structures into
the core ones.</p>

<p>
This way, generic code and drivers that only implement generic properties never
have to deal with the raw property IDs and values directly, as all the
decoding is 
done in the core code implementing the atomic <tt>ioctl()</tt>. For fancy
drivers, there's
the <tt>-&gt;atomic_set_property()</tt> and
<tt>-&gt;atomic_get_property()</tt> hooks that again operate on the state
structures and are used for decoding additional properties.</p>
<p>
Besides all these functions and hooks to handle per-object state structures, the
main atomic driver interface is  simple and consists of only two hooks:

<ul class="spacylist">

<li><tt>-&gt;atomic_check()</tt> needs to make sure that the passed-in atomic
	update is possible. It is only allowed to look at and write to state
	structures for objects referenced from the passed-in <tt>struct&nbsp;drm_atomic_state</tt>. On one hand, this is needed to make sure that the
<tt>TEST_ONLY</tt> mode doesn't accidentally change persistent hardware or
software state. The other reason is to make sure that concurrent updates don't
trample on each another by accident — duplicating a state also grabs the
required locks behind the scenes. Locking will be discussed in more detail
in the second part of this article series.</li>

<li><tt>-&gt;atomic_commit()</tt> optionally commits the state that has been
	prepared and checked by <tt>-&gt;atomic_check()</tt>. Drivers are
	allowed and encouraged to store derived state (like display clock
configuration) in the driver-private part of their state objects to avoid
duplicating logic between the check and commit hooks. Note that for robustness,
such derived state should be cleared when duplicating state objects, to make
sure that correct values are always computed. The commit function is only
allowed to fail due to lack of memory or catastrophic hardware failure. Any
other problem with the update (like lack of shared resources on the GPU) must be
caught earlier in the check callback.</li>
</ul>

The next article will
discuss a few more details of the interface around handling asynchronous
updates and locking. Of course, drivers don't have to implement the
main atomic hooks completely themselves, since that's anything but trivial —
there's a large helper library that will also be covered.

"Suddenly overlay planes became important again since they're much more power-efficient in some narrow but popular use cases like video playback."<br>
<p>
Why is that?   Is the reason that overlay planes intrinsically support a low duty-cycle scan-out due the persistence-of-vision hack?<br>

One part is that fixed-function hardware is more power efficient at scaling and color-space conversion than the general purpose render part of the gpu. But the really big part is memory bandwidth saving: If you have a video in yuv, which due to chroma subsampling is generally just half the data of rbg, and might even want to upscale it, then directly scanning out that yuv buffer instead of first converting and upscaling to rbg saves a _lot_ of memory bandwidth. Of course this is only true for dynamic content which changes every frame. But that memory bandwidth saving can result in  huge power savings since often it's just the display which prevents the SoC from going into super-deep power saving modes.<br>
<p>
Not sure what you mean with persistence-of-vision, but reducing scanout rate or outright stopping to send the same picture over and over to the panel (only works with panels which have their own framebuffer to self-refresh as needed) is a separate techinque.<br>

Thanks for the explanation, blackwood.   I take it then that it is possible to scan out YUV directly into the overlay plane, but that scanout into the regular framebuffer requires RGB?<br>

That was the case with the old video overlays from really old hardware. Moderns SoC display blocks just have a few planes, which can scan out all pixel formats. Also most often they can also all scale up (but sometimes there's only a limited number of scalers). That kind of uniform plane hardware is called universal planes too btw.<br>

Is the power-saving also related to composition?<br>
<p>
Assume hardware which scans out from only one framebuffer, ie has only one plane. If the video decode component can write directly into that framebuffer, that would be fairly efficient. But if video gets decoded into a separate buffer then _merged_ by a compositor into the final framebuffer then those extra memory writes would presumably a significant factor - and therefore using a separate plane for that video data would be useful.<br>
<p>
Can anybody here say whether video decode in modern systems is done directly into the final framebuffer even when a compositor is being used (as it usually is)?<br>

Modern compositor systems (DRI2/3, wayland) only allow one owner per buffer. Which means if you only have one plane the buffer for it necessarily must be owned by the compositor. Which means video decoding must go through an indirection buffer first. Only if you have more than one plan can you directly but the decoded video frame onto the screen. The only exception would be if the compositor doesn't need to draw anything itself and can just forward the single buffer for the full-screen app to the display hardware without copying. But that only works with full-screen ofc.<br>
<p>
DRI1 back in the days did share render buffers for 3D, but that was a giant synchronization mess and also couldn't cope with resizing the desktop and things like that. And of course with that style of direct-to-screen drawing compositors aren't possible at all (since they can't control where/how pixels are drawn at all).<br>

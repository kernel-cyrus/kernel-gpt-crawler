<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2011/">2011 Kernel Summit</a> coverage
</div>
The idea that the messages emitted by the kernel should be more structured
is hardly new.  There would be value in standardized messages: tools would
be easier to write, translations would be facilitated, documentation of
messages could be written, and so on.  But every attempt to improve the
kernel's logging has run aground.  That may be the fate of an initiative
described at the 2011 kernel summit, but, then, something may yet come of
it.
<p>
Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers got up to talk about their "journal"
work.  Their point is that syslog is getting quite old - it is essentially
1980's technology - and we need a better way to deal with messages.  Output
that is (only) human readable is not as useful as it could be.
<p>
Traditional syslog has a lot of problems.  Messages are untrusted; they can
come from anywhere.  There are lot of different logging techniques.
Parsing log files is a hard problem - tools that do so generally turn into

<a href="/Articles/464312/"><img

"regex horrors."  Kernel messages tend to have associated context which
does not make it into the log file and must be reconstructed, unreliably,
later on.  Time zone information is missing, the log stream can be
manipulated by an attacker, the use of UDP for network logging means that
messages can be dropped, there is "no sane access control," and more.  In
response to all these problems, Lennart and Kay have been designing "the
journal," which is intended to provide unified logging through the entire
software stack.   The user-space side of the journal exists now and is
integrated with service management; the kernel code is not yet available.
<p>
The user-space code is able to augment kernel messages with associated
context information; it can, for example, add the real device name that
matches a message emitted from the kernel.  Strings like "sda" make no
sense when seen in isolation on today's dynamic systems, even one day
later.
<p>
The most controversial part of the plan (so far as they were able to
present it) was the idea of attaching a 128-bit randomized tag to each
message.  These tags would have no central management; developers are
expected to simply generate a new tag when they create a new message.
Tools could then be taught the meaning of specific tags and could quickly
recognize relevant messages in the logs.  Translators and documentation
writers could attach information to specific tags.  The tag database would
be maintained on the net and run in user space; kernel developers would not
have to care about the message tags at all.
<p>
Linus broke in to make the claim that UUIDs (which is essentially what
these tags are) have never worked in the past; why, he asked, do people
still try to use them?  The IDs simply get copied around and reused; that
will happen 
with kernel messages too, he predicted.  Besides, kernel messages already
have a random bit string attached to them - it's the string that is the
message itself (or the format string from which it is created).  
Lennart's defense, which included the assertion that UUIDs are used
successfully in the EFI BIOS interface, seemed to convince few people. 
From
there, the conversation became rather loud and unstructured; those who have
complained about the lack of contention in recent kernel summits should be
less unhappy this time around.
<p>
Some of the pieces of a structured logging interface already exist, as Alan
Cox pointed out; functions like <tt>dev_printk()</tt> and friends already
encode associated device information in a set way.  But Christoph Hellwig
asserted that what users really care about is actions on objects; what
should be done is to add a new interface catering to that need and leave
<tt>printk()</tt> alone.  As it happens, Lennart and Kay propose the
addition of a <tt>journalk()</tt> logging function for just that
purpose. Output from <tt>printk()</tt> would go to the journal, but
structured messages with IDs would be created with <tt>journalk()</tt>.
<p>
It was suggested that what we are really seeing here is a reinvention of
tracepoints.  Alan added that things have to be done carefully, since these
messages, however they are created, become part of the ABI.  He also noted
that we have a good interface for logging now: netlink.  All that is needed
is to put everything together.  It turns out that using netlink for the
journal is part of the plan - but the code does not exist yet.
<p>
At the end of the session, Alan recommended that the developers not really
even think about <tt>printk()</tt>; they should find a way to characterize
what they really need, then come up with a mechanism to provide it.  Kay
and Lennart sat down without having had the time to present their full
proposal; Kay promised that they would try again next year.

to paraphrase<br>
<p>
those who do not understand syslog are doomed to reinvent it, poorly<br>
<p>
there are some real issues with syslog (the lack of any ability to know where the log message _really_ came from on a system for example), but most of the problems that are attributed to syslog are really failures in sane log formatting on the part of the application generating the log message, and what makes anyone thing that if you change to some new mechanism the application programmers will be consistent any more than they have in the past?<br>
<p>
I am dealing with this at work as well where the application programmers declare syslog 'obsolete' and go on to create their own logging mechanism.<br>
<p>
the end result after much effort?? someone finally writes a tool to get this custom log into syslog, and then things settle down.<br>

since I don't think I was clear enough in my prior message<br>
<p>
don't invent a new logging mechanism, just clean up the formatting of your logs<br>
<p>
if the kernel could just adopt a rule along the lines of:<br>
<p>
All new log messages would start at the beginning of a line, all continuations of a log message would start with whitespace<br>
<p>
it would be a huge win.<br>
<p>
this would be enough to let log daemons figure out what a complete log is, and from there log parsers can take it reasonably.<br>
<p>
log parsers frequently devolve into regex hell, but they don't have to, and it doesn't require creating a new logging protocol to solve the problem.<br>

So, let's see - a record from our code:<br>
============<br>
[Sat 26 Oct 2011] "Joe User" requested lmpp://myserver.dc=some.dc=com/service , "SUCCESS" has been returned.<br>
============<br>
<p>
How should we parse it? Well, let's start with the date. It can be parsed by regexps, but it's already some amount of code.<br>
<p>
Then there's user name. It can't be parsed by regexps at all (because of quoting, for example "Joe \"the mad\" User"). Then there's URL, which also can not be reliably parsed by regexps. And then finally the exit code which luckily is just a pre-defined string.<br>
<p>
It's _really_ _really_ easy to make log unparseable accidentally. And given that quite a lot of log messages are printed only during exceptional/error conditions you might not discover it until it's too late.<br>
<p>
So something which just CAN NOT be misused is sorely needed.<br>

      Minor nit:

You can easily parse quoted strings using something like:
<pre>
"([^"]|\\.)*"
</pre>
This will work since regexps choose the <em>longest</em> mathing string. Or am I missing something?

      You also need to account for the fact that you might have an even or odd number of backslashes before the quote:

<code><pre>echo '"foo \"bar\" baz"' | grep -E '"([^"]|\\.)*"' # Succeeds
echo '"foo \"bar\\" baz"' | grep -E '"([^"]|\\.)*"' # Ouch, that's a literal backslash, not an escaped quote!</pre></code>

To fix it, we would need to check that any quotes are preceded by an *odd* number of backslashes:

<code><pre>"([^"]|(?<=\\(\\\\)*)")*"</pre></code>

Unfortunately this doesn't work with <code>grep -P</code> ("lookbehind assertion is not fixed length"). I don't know if any other regex engines support this.

This I think is proof that you need a proper parser rather than just regex matching. Regexps are not a parser, they are (the core of) a tokenizer.<br>

There is something else that should be done. The syslog network protocol should be changed (or, rather, a new one defined) that contains *both* the formatted message *and* its facility, priority, format string and args, cleanly separated, and syslog() tweaked to generate that. Then syslog consumers can do proper classification without needing to bother with all this UUID nonsense, nor with (as now) some horrific scheme involving analyzing large numbers of messages (or by-hand work) to figure out which bit of them is the format string and which bit is not.<br>

have you looked at the latest syslog RFC? I think it supports exactly what you are looking for.<br>
<p>
however you need to note that the problematic formatting isn't done by syslog, but by the applications that are generating the log.<br>
<p>
even in the old syslog RFC, the portions under the control of the syslog daemon are well defined and specified (although there is a LOT of stuff out there that violates these specs)<br>

This is why syslog-ng has had a proper parser, driven by a database of log message formats, for many years now. No regex horrors needed. It's really quite nice (and vastly underused).

Here is a crazy thought; is it possible at compile time to get a hash of the contents of the printk() call (before format string replacements) to generate a unique ID?   That should give every unique version of a message a unique identifier that could be a key for searching and parsing.  Other kinds of conventions or standards for the contents of a message, especially for multi-line messages, would be useful as well to simplify parsing but anything that requires massive changes all over the kernel is probably no good.<br>

If you change the format string to either correct a typo or add a little more information, the hash value changes, that makes the identifier very unstable.<br>

I'm fond of my 1980s technology, but I see the point here. Still, I would hope any such effort is properly standardized between distributions. If there's an opportunity for larger technology standardization between Linux and Unix-like systems out there, that should be done too. This kind of thing should not be brought to the attention of industry standards bodies after it's been done.<br>

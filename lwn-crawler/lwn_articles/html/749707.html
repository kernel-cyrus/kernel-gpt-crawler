While updating kernels frequently is generally considered a security best
practice, there are many installations that are unable to do so for a
variety of reasons.  That means running with some number of known
vulnerabilities (along with an unknown number of unknown vulnerabilities, of
course), so some way to detect and stop exploits for those flaws may be
desired.  That is exactly what the <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lkrg/">Linux Kernel Runtime Guard</a> (LKRG)
is meant to do.
</p>

<p>
LKRG comes out of the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/">Openwall
project</a> that is perhaps best known for its <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/Owl/">security-enhanced Linux
distribution</a>. Alexander Peslyak, or "Solar Designer", who is Openwall's
founder and leader is prominent in 
security circles as well.  He <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2018/01/29/1">announced</a>
LKRG at the end of January as "<q>our most controversial project
ever</q>".  The 0.0 release that was announced was "<q>quite
sloppy</q>", Peslyak said in a <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2018/02/09/1">LKRG 0.1 release
announcement</a> on February&nbsp;9; principal developer Adam "pi3"
Zabrocki cleaned things up 
and added some new features based on ten days of feedback.
</p>

<p>
At its core, LKRG is a loadable kernel module that tries to detect changes
to the running kernel that would indicate that some kind of exploit is being
used against it.  Beyond that, it checks processes running on
the system to look for unauthorized modifications to credentials of various
sorts in order to prevent those changes from granting additional
access—something that exploits will try to do.  The initial LKRG
announcement 
describes the goals this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
While LKRG defeats many pre-existing exploits of Linux kernel
vulnerabilities, and will likely defeat many future exploits (including
of yet unknown vulnerabilities) that do not specifically attempt to
bypass LKRG, it is bypassable by design (albeit sometimes at the expense
of more complicated and/or less reliable exploits).  Thus, it can be
said that LKRG provides security through diversity, much like running an
uncommon OS kernel would, yet without the usability drawbacks of
actually running an uncommon OS.
</div>
</p>

<p>
As noted, LKRG can be bypassed, so it is really only another line of
defense in a defense-in-depth strategy, rather than a panacea of any sort.
In addition, it currently is in an experimental stage (as the version
numbers might indicate), so it only logs any kernel modifications that it
finds.  The kernel is replete with various types of self-modifying code,
from tracepoints and other debugging features to optimizations of various
sorts, so protecting the integrity of the running kernel is not a
straightforward task.
</p>

<p>
To track the running kernel, LKRG creates a database of hashes of various
types of information about
the system and the kernel running on it.  It tracks the CPUs available and 
active in the system, along with the location and
contents of their interrupt descriptor tables (IDTs) and model-specific
registers (MSRs).  Since the kernel may modify itself due to changes in the
number of CPUs hotplugged into (or unplugged from) the system, LKRG must be
ready to recalculate some of its hashes based on those events.
</p>

<p>
For the kernel, LKRG tracks the hashes of the <tt>.text</tt> section, the
<tt>.rodata</tt> section (which should never change), and the exception
table.  Beyond that, each loaded module is tracked, including information
like its <tt>struct&nbsp;module</tt> pointer, name, size and hash of its
<tt>.text</tt> section, and some other module-specific information.  The
details of that are described on the <a
href="http://openwall.info/wiki/p_lkrg/Main">LKRG wiki</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to detect modifications, the values stored need to be validated
regularly.  This is done via a number of mechanisms, starting with a
timer that checks at regular intervals; the period can be set via the
sysctl interface.  It also runs the check whenever module-loading or CPU-hotplug
activity is detected and can be triggered manually by way of 
another sysctl.  Other events in the system (e.g. CPU idle, network
activity, USB change, etc.) will trigger the validation, though only a
certain percentage of the time to reduce the performance impact. For
example, CPU idle
will trigger validation 0.005% of 
the time while a USB change will do so 50% of time.
</p>

<p>
All of that is meant to protect the integrity of the running kernel itself,
but exploits often target the processes running on the system in order to
elevate privileges and the like; that information lives in the kernel's
read-write memory.  So LKRG also tracks a whole bunch of different
attributes of each process and maintains its own task list that can be used
to validate the kernel's list.  If the two diverge, affected processes are
killed; the intent is to do so <i>before</i> they can take advantage of the
differences. 
</p>

<p>
The tracking consists of task attributes like the address of the
<tt>task_struct</tt>, process name and ID, the addresses of the
<tt>cred</tt> and <tt>real_cred</tt> credential structures, the various
user and group IDs associated with it, SELinux settings, and "secure computing"
(seccomp) settings 
and configuration.   Various other things are tracked currently
(e.g. capabilities information) but not validated.
</p>

<p>
All of that information is validated every time certain system calls
(e.g. <tt>setuid()</tt>, <tt>execve()</tt>) or
other events happen in the system (e.g. when permissions are checked prior
to opening a file).  In addition, the process-list
validation is done 
every time the kernel validation is run.  All processes are validated each
time, not just the one making the system call, and any discrepancy results
in killing
any process that has differences.
</p>

<p>
The wiki page shows tests of LKRG to detect exploits of some known kernel
vulnerabilities (e.g. <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-9322">CVE-2014-9322</a>, <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6074">CVE-2017-6074</a>);
both of those were detected, as were a few others.  The performance impact
has been 
measured in a rudimentary way: a system running LKRG 0.0 was about 6.5%
slower building 
Openwall's <a 
href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> password cracker.
Performance optimizations have not been a focus yet, but: "<q>We find
this performance impact significant (especially for a security measure
bypassable by design), and are likely to make adjustments to reduce
it.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
There are certain kinds of kernel vulnerabilities that LKRG cannot detect.
If the exploit functions entirely in user space (perhaps by exploiting a
kernel race condition like <a href="https://dirtycow.ninja/">Dirty
COW</a>), it won't modify the parts of the kernel that are being tracked,
thus won't trigger LKRG.  The home page describes it this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
However, it wouldn't be expected to detect exploits of CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty
COW) since those directly target the userspace even if via the
kernel. While in case of Dirty COW the LKRG "bypass" happened due to the
nature of the bug and this being the way to exploit it, it's also a way for
future exploits to bypass LKRG by similarly directly targeting
userspace. It remains to be seen whether such exploits become common
(unlikely unless LKRG or similar become popular?) and what (negative?)
effect on their reliability this will have (for kernel vulnerabilities
where directly targeting the userspace isn't essential and possibly not
straightforward).
</div>

<p>
LKRG is available for x86 and x86-64 and, because it is a kernel module
rather than a set of patches, it will build for a wide variety of
kernel versions. 
It can be built for the RHEL&nbsp;7 kernel, which is
based on 3.10, and it will also build for the mainline (4.15).  The project
has a <a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/lkrg-users/">mailing
list</a> for questions and support, though it is rather quiet; there are only a
few postings from January and February at this point.
</p>

<p>
It is clearly a niche project and one that may not really find many users.
For some installations, it could provide another level of defense, but it
means those users are probably not keeping up with their kernel updates.
Given that LKRG can be bypassed and that it certainly can't detect all kinds
of kernel 
exploits, it may
provide a false sense of security.  But for organizations that carefully
consider the <a 
href="http://openwall.info/wiki/p_lkrg/Threat_model">threat model for
LKRG</a> and their own needs, there is value to be found in LKRG.  Whether
there is enough value to sustain a project (and perhaps allow Openwall to
provide a non-free "LKRG Pro" version) remains to be seen.

The way this is implemented - checksum interesting bits of memory and report on those that change - heavily reminded me of those Datel video game “cheat cartridges” (poor man's debuggers) sold in the mid-90s. It's cool to see the same technique being used now to stop us being cheated :-)<br>

At the beginning I'd like to thank the author for taking his time to analyze LKRG and write a fair review. <br>
The only comment I'd like to add is that performance impact in the latest LKRG version (we're on the edge of releasing v0.2) has been greatly improved. We have introduced a new sysctl to control whether LKRG performs code integrity checks on random events (or only at regular intervals). This can be translated to the following performance impact scenarios:<br>
   -&gt; Average cost of running a fully enabled LKRG =&gt; 2.5%<br>
   -&gt; Average cost of running LKRG without the code integrity checks on random events (disabled with the new sysctl) =&gt; 0.7%<br>

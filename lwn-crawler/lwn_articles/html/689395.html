<h1>System calls for memory protection keys</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 2, 2016</br>
           </div>
"Memory protection keys" are an Intel processor feature that is making its
first appearance in Skylake server CPUs.  They are a user-controllable,
coarse-grained protection mechanism, allowing a program to deny certain
types of access to ranges of memory.  LWN last <a
href="/Articles/667156/">looked at kernel support</a> for memory protection
keys (or "pkeys") at the end of 2015.  The system-call interface is now
deemed to be in its final form, and there is a push to stage it for merging
during the 4.8 development cycle.  So the time seems right for a look at
how this feature will be used on Linux systems.
<p>
A pkey is a four-bit value (in the current Intel implementation) that can
be stored in the page-table entry for each page in a process's address
space.  Pages can thus be arbitrarily assigned to one of sixteen key
values; each address space has its own set of keys.  For each of those
keys, the process can configure the CPU
to deny either write operations or all access entirely.  Pkeys will override the
regular protections assigned to each page but, since they can only deny
operations, their effect will always be to restrict access more strictly
than the page protections do.  There are a number of intended use cases,
including the implementation of execute-only memory or the protection of
sensitive data (cryptographic keys, for example) when it is not in active
use.
<p>
Most pkey operations are unprivileged and thus could be left to user space
to handle without kernel involvement; the one exception is storing the key
values in the page-table entries.  There is value in having the kernel take
an overall role in coordinating the use of pkeys, though, so that library
code can use them without interfering with the rest 
of the application.  The kernel can also make good use of pkeys if it knows
it has exclusive access to them.  To make all this possible, <a
href="/Articles/689178/">five system 
calls</a> have been defined for working with pkeys in applications.

</blockquote>
<p>
<h4>The proposed pkey API</h4>
<p>
To avoid conflicts over the use of any specific key, pkeys should be
allocated prior to use.  The allocation system calls are:
<p>
<pre>
    int pkey_alloc(unsigned long flags, unsigned long initial_rights);
    int pkey_free(int key);
</pre>
<p>
A new protection key may be obtained with <tt>pkey_alloc()</tt>.  In the
current implementation, the <tt>flags</tt> argument must be zero, while
<tt>initial_rights</tt> is a bitmask setting the key's initial access
restrictions.  The available access bits are <tt>PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE</tt>
(disabling write access) or <tt>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</tt> (which disables
all access).  It is worth noting that these flags refer to <i>data</i>
accesses; memory with a <tt>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</tt> pkey can still be read
by the processor for execute access.
<p>
The return value from <tt>pkey_alloc()</tt> is an integer index indicating
which key was allocated, or <tt>ENOSPC</tt> if no keys are available.  Keys
which are no longer in use may be freed with <tt>pkey_free()</tt>.  Freeing
a key does not, however, remove that key value from page-table entries or
remove any restrictions that had been applied to that key.  So surprising
things could happen if an application frees a key that is still applied to
pages within its address space and the key is later reallocated to
another use.
<p>
The assigning of keys to pages is done with a new variant of the
<tt>mprotect()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int pkey_mprotect(void *start, size_t len, int prot, int pkey);
</pre>
<p>
This call behaves like <tt>mprotect()</tt> in that it will set the
(regular) protection bits described by <tt>prot</tt> on the pages
containing <tt>len</tt> bytes beginning at <tt>start</tt>.  It will also
assign the given <tt>pkey</tt> (which must have been allocated with
<tt>pkey_alloc()</tt>) to those pages.  A call to
<tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt> will succeed on systems that do not support pkeys,
but only if <tt>pkey</tt> is passed as zero.  
<p>
If an application wants to ensure that a given memory range will never be
accessible without the desired pkey restrictions, it can create that range
by passing <tt>PROT_NONE</tt> to <tt>mmap()</tt>, making the memory
initially inaccessible.  A subsequent <tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt> call will
then atomically change the protections and assign the pkey, ensuring that
there is never a window where the restrictions are not as desired.
<p>
An application can query the current restrictions associated with a pkey
using the 
<tt>RDPKRU</tt> instruction, and change them with <tt>WRPKRU</tt>, so there
is not strictly a need for the kernel to support these operations.  The
kernel provides a couple of system calls for manipulating pkey restrictions
anyway: 
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long pkey_get(int pkey);
    int pkey_set(int pkey, unsigned long access_rights);
</pre>
<p>
These functions eliminate the need to use special assembly instructions in
application code; they can also verify that the given <tt>pkey</tt> has
been allocated.
<p>
<h4>Execute-only interactions</h4>
<p>
There can be some security benefits from designating memory that
contains code 
as execute-only, so that its contents cannot be read for other purposes.
As it happens, though, setting the page protections to <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt>
does not have that effect — the affected pages are still readable.  So, on
current processors, true execute-only protections are not easily
achievable.  But, as 
mentioned above, the <tt>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</tt> restriction does not 
block execute access.  It can thus be used, in conjunction with
<tt>PROT_EXEC</tt>, to create execute-only memory ranges.
<p>
While the system-call API is still out-of-tree, the core support for pkeys
has been in the mainline kernel since the 4.6 release.  If the kernel sees
an <tt>mprotect()</tt> call setting <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt> permissions on a
range of memory, it will automatically use a pkey to create true
execute-only permissions.  This is one of the reasons why it is useful to
have the kernel in control of key allocation.
<p>
There is an interesting question that comes up, though: what if a process
sets a pkey of its own with <tt>pkey_mprotect()</tt>, then uses a regular
<tt>mprotect()</tt> call to set the page permissions to <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt>?
In this case, the kernel could either change the restrictions for the
assigned pkey, or it could change the affected pages to use its own
reserved pkey.  Either approach could lead to results that the application
developer finds surprising.
<p>
To avoid such surprises, one pkey (number zero) has been set aside as the
default key for all pages.  This key will never be allocated with
<tt>pkey_alloc()</tt>, and its restrictions cannot be changed with
<tt>pkey_set()</tt>.  As of 4.8 (assuming these patches are merged), the
kernel will only assign the execute-only pkey to pages that are currently
controlled by the default key.
<p>
The memory protection keys patches have been circulating for some time, and
have evolved considerably in response to reviewer comments.  At this point,
they would appear to have reached a stable point where the developers who
are paying attention are happy with them.  So the chances are good that the
4.8 kernel will include these system calls making the full functionality
available to applications.  How soon the requisite hardware will be widely
available is yet to be seen, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I wonder&mdash;since WRPKRU is an unprivileged instruction, userspace could turn this PROT_EXEC mapping back into R+X without the kernel knowing, no? Or does the kernel somehow enforce rules on PKRU?

Yes, userspace could turn the PROT_EXEC mapping back into R+X without the kernel knowing.  The kernel couldn't practically do anything about it until the application enters the kernel again, where it could notice and kill the app or penalize it otherwise.<br>
<p>
The kernel doesn't bother to do this checking because it is just one of a long list of things that applications can do to shoot themselves in the foot.  It's certainly not a foolproof security mechanism, but I hope it adds a useful layer to the security onion.<br>

If the system doesn't support pkeys, does the alloc call return an errno, or zero? Might make code easier to write if it returns zero, since pkey_mprotect succeeds if the okey is zero ...<br>

That would make sense, if it weren't for pkey_get()/pkey_set().  You would expect that if you can do:<br>
<p>
  foo = pkey_alloc();<br>
<p>
that you can also do:<br>
<p>
  pkey_set(foo, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE);<br>
<p>
But on a system without pkeys, that wouldn't be possible.<br>

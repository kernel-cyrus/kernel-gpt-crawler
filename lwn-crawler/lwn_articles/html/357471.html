           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 19, 2009</br>
           <hr>
LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2009/">2009 Kernel Summit coverage</a>
</div>
Peter Zijlstra started out the "state of the scheduler" session by noting
that, on occasion, Con Kolivas surfaces with a new scheduler and people
start sending in scheduler bugs.  He would really like to short out part of
the process and get problem reports regardless of Con's release schedule.
Scheduling is hard, with a lot of conflicting requirements.  But, if people
send in bug reports, preferably with reproducible test cases, the scheduler
developers will do their best to fix things.
<p>
Currently the most interesting work in the scheduling area is around
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/356576/">deadline scheduling</a>.  There are a
number of workloads where static 
priorities just do not map well to the problem space.  The biggest change
in 2.6.32, instead, is a reworking of the load balancing code.  Among other
things, the load balancer is becoming more aware of "CPU capacity."  Thus
far, the scheduler has always assumed that each processor is capable of
performing the same amount of work.  There are a number of things - runtime
power management, for example - which can invalidate that assumption.  So
the new load balancing code tries to observe what each CPU is accomplishing
and come up with an estimate of capacities to be used in scheduling
decisions. 

<p>
It was noted that there are still some problems associated with scheduling
on NUMA systems, but they were not described in any detail.
<p>
The discussion turned to scheduler benchmarks for desktop workloads.  It
was observed that kernel developers tend to optimize for kernel builds,
which is not necessarily a representative workload for the wider user
base.  Peter noted that the perf tool looks like it will be able to help in
this regard; users can use it to record system traces while running
problematic workloads, then the developers can use the recorded data to
reproduce the problem.  Linus claimed that, for many desktop interactivity
problems, the scheduler is irrelevant - the real problems tend to be at the
I/O scheduler or filesystem levels.  Others disagree, though, stating that
some problems still exist within the CPU scheduler.

</blockquote>
<p>
Hyperthreading is coming back with newer CPUs; what is the scheduler doing
to improve performance on hyperthreaded systems?  The problem here is that
a process running on a hyperthreaded CPU will adversely impact the
performance of the sibling CPU.  The variable capacity code should help
here, but there were complaints that this code is limited by what has been
observed in the past.  The future can be different, especially if the
workload shifts.  There's only so much that can be done about that;
predicting the future remains difficult.
<p>
Can performance counters be used to better estimate CPU capacity?  The
answer appears to be negative: reading a performance counter is a very
expensive operation.  Trying to integrate performance counters into
scheduling decisions would kill performance.
<p>
The cost of the scheduler itself was raised as a problem, especially on
embedded systems. It's not clear, though, how much of the problem is really
the scheduler, and how much is other work being done on the timer tick.
One observation was that indirect function calls (used within the scheduler
to call into the specific scheduler classes) can play havoc with branch
prediction on some architectures.  Linus suggested that people encountering
this problem should "get an x86 and quit whining," but chances are that
solution is not good for everybody.  It may make sense to turn the indirect
function calls into some sort of switch statement, at least for some
architectures.
<p>
The discussion then shifted to the problem of certain proprietary databases
which run specific threads under the realtime scheduling classes.  They are
apparently working around certain problems associated with their use of
user-space spinlocks.  It was agreed that this code should be using futexes
rather than rolling their own locking schemes.  
<p>
But it is not that simple: Chris Mason observed that he had tried to get
the database folks to use futexes, and they had tried it.  The resulting
performance was much worse, and he "lost the argument horribly."  One
problem is that futexes lack adaptive spin capability, which would make
them perform better.  But there were also a lot of complaints about the
implementation of locking within glibc.
<p>
For all of the usual reasons, nobody feels particularly optimistic about
being able to get fixed locking into glibc.  So there is talk of creating a
separate user-space locking library as a way of routing around the problem
and making reasonable locking available to applications.  It might be a
reimplementation of POSIX threads, or it could be a simpler library focused
on locking primitives.  Creating this library could be challenging, but
there could be some nice payoffs as well.  It might, for example, become
possible to provide a lockdep-like debugging facility to user space.
<p>
There's also a strong desire within the Samba community for a per-thread
filesystem UID.  The kernel can do this now, but glibc hides the capability
so applications cannot use it.  A separate threads/locking library could
make that feature available to applications as well.

W00t! What a great idea! Can't wait for that!!

There's a place where a lot of interesting stuff is discussed and a lot of
lock-free implementations are presented and discussed as well:

http://groups.google.com/group/lock-free/topics

It's a really worth place to visit, learn and discuss!

Maybe the 'one CPU scheduler' in main branch policy is backfiring in a way?<br>
<p>
It's much easy to see that there are scheduler bugs when you compare two schedulers than when you only have one..<br>

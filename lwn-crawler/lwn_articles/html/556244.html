           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 26, 2013</br>
           </div>
The number of latency-sensitive applications running on Linux seems to be
increasing, with the result that more latency-related changes are finding
their way into the kernel.  Recently LWN looked at the <a
href="/Articles/551284/">Ethernet device polling patch set</a>, which
implements 
polling to provide minimal latency to critical networking tasks.  But what
happens if you want the lowest possible latency for block I/O requests
instead?  Matthew Wilcox's <a href="/Articles/555886/">block driver
polling patch</a> is an attempt to answer that question.
<p>
As Matthew <a href="/Articles/556245/">put it</a>, there are users who are
willing to go to great lengths to lower the latencies they experience with
block I/O requests:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The problem is that some of the people who are looking at those
	technologies are crazy.  They want to "bypass the kernel" and "do
	user space I/O" because "the kernel is too slow".  This patch is
	part of an effort to show them how crazy they are.
</div>
<p>
The patch works by adding a new driver callback to <tt>struct
backing_dev_info</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*io_poll)(struct backing_dev_info *bdi);
</pre>
<p>
This function, if present, should poll the given device for completed I/O
operations.  If any are found, they should be signaled to the block layer;
the return value is the number of operations found (or a negative error
code).
<p>
Within the block layer, the <tt>io_poll()</tt> function will be called
whenever a process is about to sleep waiting for an outstanding operation.
By placing the poll calls there, Matthew hopes to avoid going into polling when there
is other work to be done; it allows, for example, the submission of
multiple operations without invoking the poll loop.  But, once a process
actually needs the result of a submitted operation, it begins polling rather
than sleep. 
<p>
Polling continues until one of a number of conditions comes about.  One of
those, of course, is that an operation that the current process is waiting
for completes.  In the absence of a completed operation, the process will
continue polling until it receives a signal or the scheduler
indicates that it would like to switch to a different process.  So, in
other words, polling will stop if a higher-priority process becomes
runnable or if the current process exhausts its time slice.  Thus, while
the polling happens in the kernel, it is limited by the relevant process's
available CPU time.
<p>
Linus <a href="/Articles/556248/">didn't like this approach</a>, saying
that the polling still wastes CPU time even if there is no higher-priority
process currently contending for the CPU.  That said, he's not necessarily
opposed to polling; he just does not want it to happen if there might be other
runnable processes.  So, he suggested, the polling should be moved to the
idle thread.  Then polling would only happen when the CPU was about to go
completely idle, guaranteeing that it would not get in the way of any other
process that had work to do.
<p>
But Linus might actually lose in this case.  Block maintainer Jens Axboe <a
href="/Articles/556250/">responded</a> that an idle-thread solution would
not work.  "<q>If you need to take the context
switch, then you've negated pretty much all of the gain of the polled
approach.</q>"  Also he <a href="/Articles/556251/">noted</a> that the
current patch does the polling in (almost) the right place, just where the
necessary information is available.  So Jens appears to be disposed toward
merging something that looks like the current patch; at that point, Linus
will likely accept it.
<p>
But Jens did ask for a bit more smarts when it comes to deciding when the
polling should be done; in the current patch, it happens unconditionally
for any device that provides an <tt>io_poll()</tt> function.  A better
approach, he said, would be to provide a way for specific processes to opt
in to the polling, since, even on latency-sensitive systems, polling will
not be needed by all processes.  Those processes that do not need extremely
low latency should not have to give up some of their allotted CPU time for
I/O polling.
<p>
So the patch will certainly see some work before it is ready for merging.
But the benefits are real: in a test run by Matthew on an <a
href="http://www.nvmexpress.org/">NVMe</a> device, I/O 
latencies dropped from about 8.0µs to about 5.5µs — a significant
reduction.  The benefit will only become more pronounced as the speed of
solid-state storage devices increases; as the time required for an I/O
operation approaches 1µs, an extra 2.5µs of overhead will come to dominate
the picture.  Latency-sensitive users will seek to eliminate that overhead
somehow; addressing it in the kernel is a good way to ensure that all users
are able to take advantage of this work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why does the kernel have so many different poll interfaces for driver developers, the proposed one is different once more.<br>
<p>
Character device's poll(), NAPI poll(), the low-latency ethernet poll(), this block device poll(). All are different.<br>

The different interfaces are different because they're trying to accomplish different things.  Naming is one of the three hardest problems in computer science; if they weren't all called "poll", I don't think it would irk you as much that these interfaces are different.<br>
<p>
I have to say that the system call "poll" is the worst because it literally does the opposite of polling.  It sleeps waiting for an event (unless the timeout is zero).<br>

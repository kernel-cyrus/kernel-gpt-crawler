<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 17, 2019</br>
           </div>
By the time that <a href="/Articles/783303/">5.1-rc1</a> was released and
the 5.1 merge window ended, 11,241 non-merge changesets had 
been pulled into the mainline repository.  Of those, just over 5,000 were
pulled since <a href="/Articles/782511/">the first 5.1 merge-window
summary</a>.  It often happens that the biggest changes are pulled
early, with the emphasis shifting to fixes by the end of the merge
window; this time, though, some of the most significant features were saved
for last.
<p>
Some of the noteworthy changes pulled in the second half of the 5.1
merge window are:
<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The live patching mechanism has a new "atomic replace" feature; it
     allows a single cumulative patch to replace a whole set of predecessor
     patches.  It is useful in cases where an older patch needs to be
     reverted or superseded; one use case is described in <a
     href="/Articles/775264/">this article</a>.  Some more information can
     be found in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e1452b607c48">this
     commit</a>. 
<li> The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring API</a> has been added,
     providing a new (and hopefully better) way of doing high-performance
     asynchronous I/O.
<li> If the <tt>CONFIG_PRINTK_CALLER</tt> configuration option is set,
     messages printed by the kernel will include a new field identifying
     the thread or CPU ID of the code doing the printing.  It is primarily
     meant to ease the task of reuniting streams of messages that may be
     interrupted by messages printed elsewhere in the system.
<li> It is now possible to use nonvolatile memory as if it were ordinary
     RAM.  This work is described in <a href="/Articles/777212/">this
     article from January</a>; see also <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f67e3fb48912">this changelog</a>
     for more information and some important caveats.
<li> Opening a process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory now yields a file
     descriptor that can be used to refer to the process going forward; as
     described in <a href="/Articles/773459/">this article</a>, the primary
     purpose is to prevent the delivery of signals to the wrong process
     should the target exit and be replaced (at the same ID) by an
     unrelated process.  The new <tt>pidfd_send_signal()</tt> system call
     (described in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3eb39f47934f">this
     commit</a>) can be used with these file descriptors.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block layer</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The "exofs" filesystem, meant to run on top of <a
     href="/Articles/305740/">object storage devices</a>, has been removed,
     along with SCSI-protocol support for those devices in general.
<li> The new <tt>dm-mod.create=</tt> command-line parameter can be used to
     create device-mapper volumes at boot time without the need for an
     initramfs.  See <a
     href="/Articles/783096/">Documentation/device-mapper/dm-init.txt</a>
     for more information.
<li> The F2FS filesystem has a new mode bit (<tt>F2FS_NOCOW_FL</tt>) that
     disables copy-on-write behavior for the affected file.
</ul>

<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Clock</b>:
     ZXW Crystal SD3078 realtime clocks,
     Cadence realtime clocks,
     Amlogic Meson realtime clocks,
     MicroCrystal RV-3028 realtime clocks,
     Abracon AB-RTCMC-32.768kHz-EOZ9 I2C realtime clocks,
     Epson rx8571 realtime clocks,
     NXP i.MX8MM CCM clock controllers, and
     Actions Semi OWL S500 clocks.
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     TQ-Systems QTMX86 GPIO controllers,
     Gateworks PLD GPIO expanders,
     AMD Fusion Controller Hub GPIO controllers, and
     NXP IMX8QM and IMX8MM pin controllers.
<li> <b>Graphics</b>:
     Toppoly TPG110 panels,
     ARM Komeda display processors,
     Sitronix ST7701 panels, and
     Kingdisplay kd097d04 panels.  It's also worth noting that the Nouveau
     driver now has support for heterogeneous memory management, allowing
     better sharing of RAM between the CPU and the GPU.
<li> <b>Input</b>:
     Maltron L90 keyboards,
     ViewSonic/Signotec PD1011 signature pads,
     Sitronix ST1633 touchscreen controllers, and
     Qualcomm MSM vibrators.
<li> <b>Media</b>:
     Melexis MLX90640 thermal cameras,
     Omnivision ov8856 sensors, and
     NXP i.MX7 camera sensor interfaces.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     STMicroelectronics STMPE analog-to-digital converters,
     STMicroelectronics STPMIC1 power-management ICs,
     Toshiba Mobile TC6393XB I/O controllers,
     Mellanox hardware watchdog timers,
     ChromeOS Wilco embedded controllers,
     Xilinx ZynqMP IPI mailboxes, and
     NXP Layerscape qDMA engines.
</ul>


<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The goal of stacking security modules has been <a
     href="/Articles/114588/">discussed</a> since 2004 (and probably
     before).  This work is 
     finally coming to a conclusion, and many of the necessary low-level
     changes have been merged for 5.1.  There is a new <tt>lsm=</tt>
     command-line parameter that controls which modules are loaded, and in
     which order.
<li> The new "SafeSetID" security module has been added; it places limits
     on user and group ID transitions.  For any given user (or group) ID, a
     change (via executing a setuid program, for example) would only be
     allowed if this module agrees.  ChromeOS is currently using it to
     implement its security policies; see <a
     href="/Articles/783093/">Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/SafeSetID.rst</a>
     for more information.
<li> The audit subsystem has gained support for namespaced file
     capabilities.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/712161/">structleak GCC plugin</a> has been
     extended to initialize all variables passed by reference on the
     stack.  See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/81a56f6dcd20">this
     commit</a> for details.
</ul>


<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The work to convert all <tt>fault()</tt> handlers to return the
     special <tt>vm_fault_t</tt> type has been completed, so now that type
     has been changed to be incompatible with the previous <tt>int</tt>
     type.  That will cause compilation failures on any out-of-tree modules
     that have not been updated.
<li> A new "generic radix tree" data structure has been added for simple
     uses.  There is no separate documentation for it, but <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ba20ba2e3743">this commit</a>
     contains kerneldoc comments describing how it works.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/345273/">flexible array</a> data structure has
     been removed; its (few) users have been converted to use generic radix
     trees instead.
<li> The ever-larger <tt>file_operations</tt> structure has gained a new
     <tt>iopoll()</tt> method; it is used by the io_uring mechanism.
<li> The handling of masks in the DMA-mapping layer has changed somewhat.
     Previous kernels required drivers to find a mask that the kernel was
     willing to accept; now, the mask provided by drivers describes only
     the device's capabilities, and the kernel worries about higher-level
     limitations.  That should allow the simplification of a lot of driver
     initialization code.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9eb9e96e97b3">This commit</a>
     describes the change.
<li> The internal handling of filesystem mounts has changed considerably in
     preparation for the addition of the <a href="/Articles/759499/">new
     mount API</a>.  The new system calls have still not been added,
     though, and seem likely to wait for another development cycle.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5fe1890d0e20">this documentation
     commit</a> for a description of the new internal API.
<li> The GCC compiler can use indirect jumps for <tt>switch</tt>
     statements; those can end up using retpolines on x86 systems.  The
     resulting slowdown is evidently inspiring some developers to recode
     <tt>switch</tt> statements as long <tt>if</tt>-<tt>then</tt>-<tt>else</tt>
     sequences.  In 5.1, the compiler's <tt>case-values-threshold</tt> will
     be raised to 20 for builds using retpolines — meaning that GCC will not
     create indirect jumps for statements with less than 20 branches —
     addressing the
     performance issue without the need for code changes that might well
     slow things down on non-retpoline systems.
</ul>
<p>

Unless something perturbs the usual schedule, the final 5.1 release can be
expected at the beginning of May.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

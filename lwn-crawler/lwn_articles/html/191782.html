Ever since the current realtime patch set began to circulate, there have
been questions about when (and if) it would be merged into the mainline.
Ted Ts'o and Ingo Molnar's session on realtime support started with the
note that, to a great extent, this merging has happened.  Over the last
year, features like robust futexes, priority inheritance, the
generic IRQ layer, the core timekeeping rewrite, and the lock validator
have all gone into the mainline.  For the first time in history, somebody
(Ingo) was able to propose the merging of priority inheritance without
getting flamed to a crisp by Linus.
<p>
As a result of all this merging, the out-of-tree realtime
patch set has shrunk considerably in size.
About 700KB of patches remain, however.  The biggest chunks at this point
are the high-resolution timers and sleeping spinlocks.
<p>

A realtime kernel can now regularly achieve 20&nbsp;&micro;sec response
times on a heavily loaded system.  Anymore, when there are response time
issues, the 
problem is likely to be hardware related.  It is, in other words, possible
to make a Linux kernel 
which can provide realtime response - something many people would not have
believed even a short time ago.  
<p>
There is some cost to this, in terms
of code complexity and system performance, but the performance hit is
often less than people think.  Stock kernels do not properly account for
time spent handling interrupts, while realtime kernels (as a result of
moving interrupt handlers into processes) do.  So programs may look like
they are using more CPU, but it is really just a matter of the kernel
noticing the time lost to interrupts.
<p>

With regard to merging, the hard work has been done.  Some of the trickiest
patches were the ones which cleaned up locking semantics, made the big
kernel lock preemptible, etc.  One challenging part which remains is
identifying the 
few locks which must remain "raw" (non-preemptible) spinlocks in a realtime
kernel.  There is a relatively small number of those, but it is important
to find them all and change them over to the proper lock type.
<p>

One outstanding issue is recovery when a realtime task goes out of
control.  On a realtime kernel, a high-priority task can block out
everything else, including interrupt handlers.  Current techniques for
handling this situation are limited to those involving the power button.
It might be nice to add something like a soft lockup detector.  Linus,
however, thinks that this is not a problem which should concern people.  If
you truly want hard realtime, that is what you will get, and vulnerability
to runaway high-priority processes is part of the deal.
<p>

A nice feature for the future might be realtime disk and filesystem I/O.
Essentially, a process which remains within a given bandwidth limit could
perform I/O and still have realtime response behavior.
<p>

The question was asked: why bother with sleeping locks?  Making locks
preemptible is seen by some as a way of papering over the real problem:
long lock hold times.  Why not simply fix those?  The answer comes in a
couple of parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Extensive efforts have been expended toward fixing lock problems for
     many years, and those efforts will continue into the future.  The use
     of sleeping locks is not being used as an excuse to avoid fixing code
     which holds locks for too long.
<p>
<li> Ensuring realtime response in the absence of preemptible locks
     requires auditing the entire body of kernel source - all eight million
     lines or so.  That's a big job, and one which is hard to keep up with
     in an environment where nearly ten thousand lines of code are being
     changed every day.  Sleeping locks reduce the audit requirements to a
     couple thousand lines - a much more tractable problem.  For those who
     need realtime response, guaranteed, that is a good deal.
</ul>
<p>
Linus indicated that (unlike some others) he has no problem with merging
the sleeping locks patch, as long as there is no danger that sleeping locks
might be configured in by default.  That seems unlikely, given that
distributors do not even turn on the much milder kernel preemption feature
which has been present throughout the 2.6 kernel series.  Since the
realtime features ruin performance on large SMP systems, they are not
likely to be turned on in enterprise kernels either.  Even so, there is said
to be pressure on distributors to make realtime kernels available.  That
pressure becomes harder to resist once a feature makes it into the
mainline.  It appears that this work may well be merged, however, so
distributors may have to show a little backbone.

      The editor - along with many other people - seems to equate <i>low latency</i> with realtime. That is not how I view it as a realtime programmer. For me the important issue <i>deterministic latencies</i>.
On a system based on fixed priorities, like the real-time priorities in Linux, it is important that the latency for a task running at a given priority only depends on what is running at equal or higher priority.
If the OS offers that, you can use it to build a real-time system. How <i>low</i> the latencies are, is ofcourse important for the specific application.<p>

Now some people at LKML claims that for a system to be hard real-time it has to be mathematically proved to be so. For me that is mixing up the issues. 
People can easily use Linux for other mission critical applications without having a mathematical proof it won't crash. They rely on observation and the fact that the coders consider all crashes as very important bugs. You can then also rely on Linux giving deterministic latencies by observation and if you know the coders have done what they can to avoid unbounded latencies.<p> 

The latter can be an issue. The first problem is that 95% of the Linux hackers do not care about real-time. Therefore they wont bother about making code with unbound execution inside spin-locks. The  trick about turning spin-locks into mutexes helps that: The unbound code is suddenly preemptible and the higher priority real-time tasks does not have to worry. Sometimes per-cpu variables are used and protected with preempt_disable() or local_irq_disable(). All those places have to be looked at, when people want to use those subsystems in a real-time system.<p>

The second problem is that not even all those coding on real-time systems agree on the rules! So the kernel can still get code from XYZ for real-time which turns out not to be if not properly reviewed. I have noticed stuff added to the preempt-realtime itself which is not entirely safe against Joe User. I.e. Joe User could make an evil program making the latencies very high.<p>

Merging preempt-realtime into the main-line will be a good idea. Then Linux can compete with the dedicated RTOSes - which don't even have to care about Joe User because they typically are single user systems. But for Linux to be really successfull in doing that, someone has to specify the aims and the rules. And there has to be reviews of everything entering the kernel to see if it breaks the real-time behaviour - or at least mark it as unsafe for real-time perposes.

      Maybe I should have been clear: the realtime folks claim 20 &micro;sec <i>worst case</i> response times.  They are aiming for determinism, not just quickness.

      I have to disagree about the comment about 95% of the kernel hackers don't care about real-time.  Actually, being more specific, they worry about latency, not to the degree of us real-time folks, but they certainly do care.  That's why there is a big push to separate out the latency-tracer patches to be merged into mainline.  A lot of clean up code has been happily accepted that fixes latency problems.<br>
<p>
This is one of the things that most of the kernel hackers agree on.  No matter what you think about the RT patch, it definitely has found and was a source of a fix to numerous bugs.  Some of the patches were clean ups, others fixed hard to find  deadlocks, and several fixed up latency problems.  So in general, the RT patch has been good to the Linux kernel in general.<br>

      I was under the impresion that the RT patchset included priority inheritance in the kernel. I know that Ingo has submitted patches for user space priority inheritance (which I think have been merged).<br>
<p>
If RT is merged totally does it mean that the kernel will need to support kernel priority inheritance? Isn't this what Linus had been dead set against?<br>

      Priority inheritance is in 2.6.18.  See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/178253/">this article</a> for a description of the PI patch.  There's not really any difference between user-space and kernel-space PI - it's all implemented in the kernel in any case.

      yes. The kernel/rtmutex.c code which implements user-space PI (the new PI-futexes API) is the exact same code used for preemptible spinlocks too in -rt. It was not entirely trivial to merge the two uses into the same subsystem, but it's reality now. (And i dont want to take all credit for it, large portions of this solution were designed and written by Thomas Gleixner, Esben Nielsen and Steven Rostedt.)<br>

<p>
In embedded systems, it is common to use a watchdog for this situation.  It would seem to be straightforward to construct one using a highest priority task (doing a timed wait on a semaphore), and a low priority task which periodically posts to that semaphore.  If the semwait times out, the watchdog task takes appropriate action against the offending process.<br>
<p>
Any reason not to foist it off onto user space like that?<br>

      There is already a soft watchdog in the kernel almost exactly like that - the only difference from your proposal is that instead of one high-priority process it is the timer interrupt to do the check; I also think that since the time interrupt <i>should</i> remain a raw interrupt without a task checking for it (it's used for the scheduler) it <i>is</i> the same thing.
<p>
And both things aren't safe when a process disables interrupts but that's not interesting (you really need a hardware watchdog for that).

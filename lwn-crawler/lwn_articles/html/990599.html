<a href="/Articles/990740/">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
Tracking of regressions seems like an important task for any project; there
is no other way to ensure that known problems are fixed.  At the 2024
Maintainers Summit, though, Thorsten Leemhuis, who has been doing that work
for the kernel, expressed some doubts about whether it is worth continuing.
The result was an energetic session on how regression tracking should be
done better, and how this work should be supported.
<p>
Leemhuis began by saying that he is thinking about giving up on regression
tracking.  The funding that was supporting this work has gone away.  On top
of that, this work has resulted in a number of "annoying" discussions with
maintainers who do not appreciate being nagged about open regressions.  He
does not really even know what Linus Torvalds expects with regard to
regression tracking and fixes.  Burnout is a problem for many maintainers,
and being pressed to fix regressions can make it worse, but burnout is a
problem for Leemhuis as well
<p>

<a href="/Articles/990739/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/ms/ThorstenLeemhuis-sm.png" alt="[Thorsten
Leemhuis]" title="Thorsten Leemhuis" class="rthumb"></a>

He made a request for some basic guidance regarding the expectations in
this area.  His reports to Torvalds on open regressions often get no reply
at all; Torvalds answered that he tends not to answer email unless it is
truly necessary.
<p>
A lack of support from developers and maintainers is making the
regression-tracking task harder.  There is <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/regressions/">a mailing list for discussions
on regressions</a>, but almost nobody adds it to the CC list.  He understands
why; few people want to feel that he is watching them, but including that
list would help a lot.  The use of <tt>Closes</tt> tags on patches that fix
regressions would also be useful.
<p>
Leemhuis said that he often gets responses along the lines of "you are not
my manager" when he reminds maintainers of regressions in their subsystem.
It makes him feel bad; "nobody likes cops" and he is not enjoying being
one.
<p>
With regard to tools, dealing with <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/">the kernel bugzilla</a> remains
annoying.  Additionally, he cannot add bugzilla participants to email CC
lists due to GDPR rules; email addresses provided there are personally
identifying information, and the site's policy does not allow exposing them
in that way.  Some subsystems, he said, are using him as a go-between with
bugzilla, but he is not paid to do that work.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->

His <a href="https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot"><tt>regzbot</tt></a>
regression-tracking tool works, he said, but he has never been a good
programmer and would like some help with it.  He has, still, added GitHub
support to regzbot and can track regressions reported there.  In the
absence of funding, though, he is unlikely to continue this work.
<p>
He mentioned the possibility of maintaining a separate Git tree for
regression fixes that could be sent upstream if subsystem maintainers do
not send fixes themselves.  Torvalds said that he has pulled that sort of
fixes branch in the past but did not like it; that is not the right way to
bypass maintainers.  But perhaps it is necessary, he said, when regressions
are not being fixed.  Jens Axboe suggested that this sort of bypass should
be normal practice for any regressions that are still present when the
development cycle reaches -rc6.
<p>
<h4>Fix or revert</h4>
<p>
The discussion had mostly focused on reverting changes that cause
regressions, but Torvalds pointed out that there is often a known fix for
any given bug, so a revert is not always the right approach.  Fixes are
better than reverts, but he does not want anybody to rely on third parties
getting fixes upstream.  Will Deacon said that maintainers, in general,
strongly prefer to not have regressions in their subsystems and they do not
just ignore them.  It can take a while to get a fix in, though; fixes need
testing and integration work.  It can be annoying to be nagged by Leemhuis
while this work is ongoing.
<p>
Leemhuis responded that he does not normally bother maintainers if he is
able to see any sort of activity aimed at a problem.  He does get a bit
more aggressive if a regression has found its way into the stable trees,
though; in that case, the fix cannot be backported until it hits the
mainline, so there is an additional reason to hurry.  Torvalds said that
his normal deadline for fixes is -rc6; if nothing has arrived by then he
will consider other actions.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that there can be a few failure points in this whole
process.  One is when maintainers acknowledge a regression, but hold off on
applying a fix.  A different sort of failure happens in the case of
sporadic maintainers, who may not be paying attention at the time at all.
He once fell down on a regression that he had not realized had found its
way into a released kernel.  Since he did not know that real users were
affected, he did not prioritize a quick fix; better reporting would have
helped in that case, he said.
<p>
Ts'o also noted that this is the first he has heard that the
regression-tracking work is no longer funded; fixing that should be "a
no-brainer", he said.  Thomas Gleixner added that the kernel needs to apply
some sort of "sustainability tax" so that this work (and more, including
addressing technical debt) can be supported.  Ts'o said that developers
should push their employers to support cleanup work, but Gleixner was
pessimistic about that approach; proper funding and dedicated people are
what is needed.
<p>
Kees Cook asked Leemhuis whether he wants to continue this work if funding
can be found; if so, what other changes would he like to see?  Leemhuis
said that he would like to continue, but that he wants to see some
agreed-upon guidelines about regression response and what his role should
be.  Deacon said that there are two jobs involved: tracking regressions
(which everybody wants more of), and chasing developers for fixes, which is
less popular.  Perhaps, he suggested, the responsibilities should be
separated.
<p>
Rafael Wysocki said that, when he did regression tracking years ago, he
only did the tracking part.  Torvalds said that he likes it when somebody
else is the bad guy for once.  But, he said, adding more people to the task
is not going to improve fix times.  He suggested working more on automated
tracking and nagging; people respond less emotionally to an automated
message.  But, he said, it would also be good to just impose a policy
saying that, after a given number of weeks without a fix, a patch causing a
regression will simply be reverted.
<p>
<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<p>
With regard to guidelines, Ts'o suggested that, normally, a fix should land
in linux-next within a week of a regression report.  Jason Gunthorpe said
that, sometimes, a regression has wide-ranging impact, causing automated
testing to fail.  Those regressions need to be fixed quickly; that can
involve escalating a situation to Torvalds, which nobody likes.  Torvalds,
though, said that escalation is the right thing to do; he is happy to
aggressively revert changes that break testing.  Having a patch reverted
that way does not need to carry a stigma; it is simply something that
happens at times.
<p>
Dan Williams suggested that a fully automatic process for reverting buggy
commits would help to reduce the stigma associated with reversion; Torvalds
agreed, saying that would make things less personal.  Deacon suggested
putting the responsibility on maintainers to do those reverts; Torvalds
said he would like that, but he feared that each additional person in the
chain would add latency before a fix gets to the mainline.  Alexei
Starovoitov said that, in some subsystems, reverts are just standard
procedure; Torvalds worried that such a policy could encourage people to
apply non-ready patches, secure in the knowledge that they can be quickly
pulled back out if it turns out to be a bad idea.  Dave Airlie said that
sometimes reverting a patch is not simple; other changes may depend on it.
Torvalds answered that the process can never be entirely automatic.
<p>
Leemhuis said that the most important task is to establish some real
deadlines for regression response; Torvalds suggested writing a
documentation patch and getting comments.  Leemhuis also asked about
whether there is too much immediate backporting of fixes that land in the
mainline during the merge window, risking backporting regressions as well.
The problem there, Torvalds answered, is that linux-next is not getting
enough testing; many of those regressions should never get to the mainline
in the first place.
<p>
When asked which subsystems handle regressions well, Leemhuis mentioned the
tip tree (which handles x86 and many core-kernel patches) and the block
subsystem.  Gleixner (the "t" in "tip") said that this responsiveness comes
at a price; dealing with regressions takes a lot of time.  More
problematic, Leemhuis said, are often the "sub-subsystems" that go through
more than one level of maintainer.  The top-level maintainer may understand
the situation, but low-level maintainers may be too far removed from
Torvalds to share the same priorities.  As a result, fixes can sit in
linux-next for too long before landing upstream.
<p>
Torvalds asserted that linux-next is useful for changes aimed at the next
merge window, but that it is less useful for fixes.  The needed test
coverage, he said, just isn't there.  So running fixes though linux-next is
just a waste of time.  Arnd Bergmann protested that he is indeed running
daily build tests on linux-next and letting maintainers know when things
break.  Many of the problems he reports move into the mainline unfixed,
though.
<p>
As the session closed, the maintainers in the room affirmed that they find
the regression-tracking work useful, and that they would like it to
continue.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sometimes so called "regressions" are actually the correct fixes that unveal the issues hidden for ages in the kernel. Should we ever consider a revert to those "regression" as an option? Yet, it might be difficult in rare cases to trully fix the "regression" and requires a lot of additional refactoring that may be not the subject to backport...<br>

I've gotten similar responses when talking about test infrastructure. <br>
<p>
When I get good, working test automation into the hands of developers, I get responses along the lines of "killer app" - good tooling makes people's lives easier. But a lot of maintainers seem to be pretty checked out, and it's the maintainers who have the responsibility of making sure that things work, and we're delivering code to users that actually functions. <br>
<p>
I see pretty wildly different levels of "giving a shit" about this stuff across subsystems - a lot of bug reports end up on my desk - and I may start naming names.<br>

There are plenty of people trying to push "non-ready" patches, however those people are the ones who hate reverts _the most_ and who will try to offer all kinds of "non-ready" quick fixes to avoid a revert at all cost.<br>

I've met a few (not in the kernel though). These are the people who don't care about their job and have no respect for the rest of the team. The same people who never test and only rely on the CI to accept their changes. They just go forward all the time until blocked by a process or a person. They're constantly up-to-date on their job, well regarded by their managers and hated by their coworkers for constantly breaking stuff and leaving it to others to fix.<br>

I think we're talking about the same people. I should have been more specific. What I specifically questioned is the bit: "_secure_ in the knowledge that their patches can be _reverted_".<br>
<p>
These people generally: 1. think everything will work - even after being proven wrong a million times 2. when they broke something, it was never important. Just a small and temporary build breakage - who cares? (obviously: everyone else cares about wasting time for no good reason) 3. Why would you revert some regression when you can apply yet another quick and poorly tested patch?<br>
<p>
So neither "secure in..." nor "revert" are part of their vocabulary.<br>
<p>
Torvalds imagined careful people who care about breakages but who carelessly submit untested patches. These people don't exist, either you're careful or you're careless, no one is both at the same time for the same thing.<br>

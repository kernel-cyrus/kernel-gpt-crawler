The SCSI protocol normally specifies a two-sided conversation between an
"initiator," which initiates requests, and a "target," which acts upon
those requests.  Normally, the initiator is the host computer, while the
target is a storage device; it's thus not surprising that the bulk of the
SCSI-related code in the kernel implements the initiator role.  There are
times, though, when it is useful to have a Linux system act as a SCSI
target, usually when that system is the interface to some sort of
complicated storage array.  The target mode is currently implemented by the
<a href="http://stgt.sourceforge.net/">STGT</a> code, but that subsystem
has been seen as being ripe for replacement for some time.
<p>
There are two main contenders to replace STGT: <a
href="http://www.linux-iscsi.org/index.php/Main_Page">LIO</a> and <a
href="http://scst.sourceforge.net/">SCST</a>.  In the end, there's really
only room in the kernel for one SCSI target implementation, so there
naturally has been a fair amount of tension between these two projects.
Whenever the discussion turned to choosing one, it tended toward the ugly
side.  SCSI maintainer James Bottomley has done his best to stay out of the
flames, but, in the end, he must make a decision and merge one of them.
<p>
A few months back, it began to become clear that LIO was going to be the
winner.  More recently, James <a href="/Articles/420693/">gave the green
light</a> to begin merging this code for the 2.6.38 kernel.  Suffice to say
that SCST maintainer Vladislav Bolkhovitin <a href="/Articles/420695/">did
not take the decision well</a> and did his best to restart the battle in a
wider context.  James has stuck with his decision, though, <a
href="/Articles/420697/">saying</a> that there is not much to choose
between technically, and that it came down to community:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 Or said a different way: as long as you choose the most community
	 oriented of competing offerings, the community will fill any
	 perceived gaps.  Conversely, you can destroy a project simply by
	 alienating the community.  That's why community is more important
	 than feature set.
</div>
<p>
The previous discussions appear to have worn down most other participants,
so few people chose to join in this time around.  There doesn't seem to be
anything to suggest that the decision will change at this point; unless
something surprising happens, LIO will be the in-kernel SCSI target
subsystem as of 2.6.38.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This was stupid.  SCST is far more mature as a general purpose target.  LIO is an iSCSI target that made a token effort to add some hardware drivers to quell concern about it being merged over SCST.  They even admit on their wiki the Qlogic driver was based on the SCST implementation.  That's fine, it's open source, but what point does reimplementing all the drivers SCST has developed over a decade serve?  For all intents and purposes, SCST is a better choice.  The development of LIO will fizzle out for anything but iSCSI after it is merged because it doesn't make business sense to RisingTides.  Meanwhile, SCST has been used in products and production for years.  WTF?<br>

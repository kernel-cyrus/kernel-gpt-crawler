<p>
In a combined storage and filesystem track session at the 
2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, John
Garry continued the theme of "untorn" (or atomic) writes that started in <a
href="/Articles/1016015/">the previous session</a>.  It was also
an update on where things have gone for untorn writes since his <a
href="/Articles/974578/">session at last year's summit</a>.  Beyond that,
he looked at some of the plans and challenges for the feature in the future.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Garry called the feature, which he has been working on for a year or two at
this point, "torn-write protection".  The idea is to prevent the system
from "tearing" a write operation by only writing part of it.  It is
important for database systems, he said, so that they do not need to
double-buffer their data to protect against partial writes when there is a
power failure or system crash.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt> flag has been added to the <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pwritev.2.html"><tt>pwritev2()</tt></a>
system call to specify that a given write should either be committed in
full to the storage deviceâ€”or that none of it should be.  But, in order to
guarantee persistence, <tt>RWF_SYNC</tt> (or similar operations) are still
required.  The supported minimum and maximum sizes for atomic writes can be
queried using the <tt>STATX_WRITE_ATOMIC</tt> flag for the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
system call.  Those values will be powers of two and any <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt>
writes will need to also have a power of two length value between
the minimum and maximum; the buffer will need to be aligned, as well.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Lever could "<q>hear the eyeballs rolling in the back of the
room</q>" but wondered about databases that use network filesystems for
their storage; he does not think that untorn writes are supported there.
The Linux NFS client supports direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, at the request of database
developers, he said, but it would require support in the NFS protocol to
handle untorn writes.  Garry said that the iomap layer sets a flag on
untorn writes that the block layer can use, but Lever pointed out that the
block layer of interest would be on the server, so the two of them agreed
that some work will need to be done to support that.
</p>

<h4>Hardware based</h4>

<p>
Garry said that SCSI and NVMe have non-complementary feature sets.  For
NVMe, all writes are implicitly atomic as there is no dedicated command to
request an atomic write, unlike SCSI, which has the
<tt>WRITE_ATOMIC_16</tt> command for that purpose.  But NVMe writes are
only actually atomic if they follow the rules on write lengths
and do not cross an atomic-write boundary if one exists.  That's
not great, he said, because there is no indication if those rules are
broken; the write could end up torn.  The Linux NVMe driver detects that
condition and returns an error, however.  SCSI will reject the atomic
command if its conditions are not met.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
The virtual filesystem (VFS) and block-layer support for untorn writes on
SCSI and NVMe were merged into the 6.12 kernel.  There is also <a
href="/Articles/1009298/">support for XFS</a>, but it is limited to writes
with a size of a
single filesystem block.  At roughly the same time, though, support for <a
href="/Articles/1009548/">filesystem blocks larger than the page size</a>
was merged, so XFS filesystems with an 8KB or 16KB block size can do untorn
writes for those sizes using direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.
</p>

<p>
Due to the way the iomap layer works, an atomic write cannot currently be
done for a mixed range, such as a range containing both data and holes;
that could be solved, but it is would be painful to do, he said.  A bigger
problem for XFS is that there is no guarantee that the disk blocks in an
atomic write are contiguous or that they are properly aligned.  The
filesystem blocks could be "<q>backed by disk blocks that are sparsely
spread out through the filesystem</q>".
</p>

<p>
He and others had been pushing the addition of an XFS forcealign attribute
as a solution to those problems.  It would guarantee that filesystem blocks
were allocated and aligned correctly. The <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/xfs-realtime-device">XFS realtime
device</a> has "large allocation units" that can be used to provide the
needed guarantees, so forcealign extended that feature to the regular
filesystem, but other XFS developers did not seem to think that was the
right thing to do.  The forcealign feature is, thus, not being pursued
currently.
</p>

<p>
So he turned to the large-block-size work.  Switching the filesystem
block size to 16KB would inherently provide the needed alignment guarantees
and XFS already supported writing a single filesystem block atomically.
But, when testing MySQL performance using a 16KB filesystem block (which is
the same as the database block size) and atomic writes, he and his
colleagues found "<q>significant performance impact</q>" in some tests,
particularly those with a lower number of threads.  Using double-buffered
writes for the database performed better than atomic writes.
</p>

<p>
The problem was diagnosed to be from writes of the "<a
href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-redo-log.html">redo
log</a>", which is a buffered 512-byte write followed by an <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html"><tt>fsync()</tt></a>.
With a 4KB filesystem block, that is inefficient because it is updating
much less than the block, but raising the block size to 16KB only makes
that worse.  There have been efforts to improve the performance of the redo
log, but this kind of pattern is seen in lots of different kinds of
applications; it is not just a MySQL problem.
</p>

<h4>Filesystem based</h4>

<p>
So far, only the hardware-based solutions for atomic writes have been
pursued, Garry said.  A while back, Christoph Hellwig worked on <a
href="/Articles/789600/">atomic writes for filesystems</a>, which was
(originally) based on opening files using an <tt>O_ATOMIC</tt> flag.
Filesystem-based atomic writes would not have the alignment and
single-extent requirements that come with the hardware-based variant.  In
addition, since hardware with atomic-write support is uncommon, a
filesystem-based variant would bring the feature to many more users.
</p>

<p>
So he is currently working on XFS atomic writes.  A write of that kind
would allocate staging blocks where the data gets written, non-atomically,
and then the block mappings will be updated atomically in a single
transaction.  The XFS copy-on-write (CoW) <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(file_system)">fork</a> can be
used for the staging blocks, but it will mean that a write requires an
allocation, block remapping, and a free operation, so it will be slower.
Unlike the hardware-based solution, though, it would not require a
reformatting of the filesystem to increase the block size as long as the
existing filesystem supports XFS reflink.
</p>

<p>
When the CoW blocks are allocated, aligned blocks are requested so that
hardware-based atomic writes can be used if that is available.  It would be
a hybrid approach, that would first try to do the atomic write via the
hardware.  If the alignment or write-size are not suitable, it would fall
back to the filesystem-based atomic writes.
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein asked if user space can test for which mode it will get or
request that only a particular mode is used.  Is there a way for the
application to know which will be used, he wondered.  The idea is that once
the database, for example, has been running for a while, everything will be
aligned and all of the atomic writes will be done with the hardware, Garry said.
</p>

<p>
Mike Snitzer noted that it made sense to do this work for XFS, since it is
widely used, but he is concerned that the work is XFS-specific.  He
wondered if the feature would be useful for any filesystem, including NFS
and other network filesystems, returning to Lever's question.  Is there a
plan for a more generic mechanism to join multiple blocks into an atomic
write?  Garry said that there are features like "bigalloc" for ext4 that
can be used for that filesystem; that work is currently ongoing.  But
Snitzer said that was just another filesystem-specific scheme and not
something generic at the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer that any Linux
filesystem might be able to use.
</p>

<p>
SCSI and NVMe support for atomic writes requires
that the blocks involved in the write be contiguous on the storage device,
Ted Ts'o said, 
which is ultimately a filesystem-specific attribute.  He has chosen not to
use the forcealign approach for ext4 because it would require that the
database files be restored onto a new filesystem, with different attributes
and less fragmentation, which is not popular for production databases.
</p>

<p>
He has funding from his company (Google) to support untorn 16KB writes on
ext4 for databases, but nothing further than that.  He hopes to
have that support get merged as part of the Linux 6.16 release.  It uses
the bigalloc feature with a 16KB cluster size in order to get the required
alignment for the underlying hardware.  There are vendors "<q>shipping
product today, they're just simply relying on the fact that 'we
desk-checked the block layer'</q>" and that the vendors' testing has shown
that in 
practice writes will not be torn. "<q>Yes, this is terrifying, this is why I
want all of this stuff to land for real.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Chris Mason returned to Goldstein's point, noting that silently going from
the fast, hardware-based atomic writes to slow, filesystem-based writes is
not what his customers want.  They want to use the hardware-based mechanism
and to get an error if that cannot be done.  Garry said that in the testing
that has been done, the software-based writes do not "<q>typically</q>"
occur.
</p>

<p>
But Mason said that means that in production once in a while,
writes will start being slow; he would rather get an error.  Garry said
that is not a good user experience, however.
Josef Bacik
agreed with Mason, saying that something that randomly slows down once in a
while will cause him to "<q>lose my mind and we just won't use it</q>"; he
noted that "typically" means that "<q>across 100,000 nodes it happens once
a day on a random machine</q>".
</p>

<p>
Garry asked what the user is supposed to do if they get an error instead.
Bacik and Mason said that it will then be clear that something in the
environment was misconfigured or otherwise broken so that it can be
addressed.  Hellwig said that the developers should fix the instrumentation
of the system "<q>instead of creating stupid interfaces</q>".  The
information on whether the fallback has been used is easily available from
a tracepoint, but Mason pointed out that his users cannot run all of the systems
with tracepoints enabled.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that even with bigalloc, there are ways that users could mess up
the atomic-write requirements; for example, by punching holes in every
other block in the cluster.  Ext4 will do the right thing, he said, by
writing zeroes into the holes and fixing up the extent trees so that atomic writes can be submitted to the
block layer, but "<q>will log a message saying 'user space did a
stupid'</q>".  That is so he can close bugs with performance complaints when
that happens; he could do it with tracepoints, but those are generally not
enabled in production.
</p>

<p>Garry closed by mentioning a <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20250319114402.3757248-1-john.g.garry@oracle.com/"><tt>statx()</tt>
change</a> he would like to make to report the maximum length for the
hardware atomic write.  That would allow applications to try to ensure
their atomic writes go as fast as they can without falling back to the
slower filesystem-based version.  His last item was the upstream status of
the work. The iomap changes for the
filesystem-based atomic writes were submitted for 6.15 and the XFS
support for the feature is targeted for 6.16.

Facepalm. Silently failing behind the scenes is the _worst_ possible interface. And the suggested "fix" is to add a source-code specific tracepoint? Really?<br>

Yeah.. The users for this feature are going to be people who seriously care about perf. They will certainly want to fix the misconfiguration, and not just run in whatever slow path.<br>
<p>
Silently taking a fallback path just makes the problem harder to diagnose.<br>
<p>
This would be a good choice for a simple high-level API that targets a wide audience, where people might not want to be bothered with any low-level details, perhaps.<br>

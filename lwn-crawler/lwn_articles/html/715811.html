<a href="/Articles/715429/">CVE-2017-6074</a> is the vulnerability identifier
for a use-after-free bug in the kernel's network stack.  This vulnerability
is apparently exploitable in local privilege-escalation attacks.  The
problem, introduced in 2005, is easily fixed, but it points at a couple of
shortcomings in the kernel development process; as a result, it would not
be surprising if more bugs of this variety were to turn up in the near
future. 
<p>
One of the network subsystem's core data structures is the <tt>sk_buff</tt>
structure, which often goes by the name SKB.  This complex structure
contains and describes a packet for its entire life cycle in the kernel.
As with many kernel data structures, SKBs are reference-counted.  Whenever
some kernel function takes a reference to an SKB, it increments the
internal reference count; the reference is released by decrementing that
count.  As long as the count is nonzero, a reference to the SKB exists
somewhere in the kernel, so the structure itself needs to continue to
exist.
<p>
Normal kernel conventions call for the existence of a pair of functions,
ending in <tt>_get()</tt> and <tt>_put()</tt>, to acquire and release a
reference to a data structure.  Thus, for example, a reference to a
<tt>kref</tt> structure is obtained with <tt>kref_get()</tt> and released
with <tt>kref_put()</tt>.  The networking layer does provide
<tt>skb_get()</tt> which, as expected, increments the reference count on an
SKB.  There is also an <tt>skb_put()</tt>, but it has nothing to do with
reference counts at all; instead, it increments some internal pointers to
reflect that some data has been added to the packet.  To release a
reference to an SKB, one calls one of:
<p>
<pre>
    void kfree_skb(struct sk_buff *skb);
    void consume_skb(struct sk_buff *skb);
    void dev_kfree_skb(struct sk_buff *skb);
    void  __kfree_skb(struct sk_buff *skb);
</pre>
<p>
Both <tt>kfree_skb()</tt> and <tt>consume_skb()</tt> will decrement the
reference count and, if the result is zero, free the structure.  They
differ only in how they affect the various network statistics;
<tt>kfree_skb()</tt> implies that a packet was dropped, while
<tt>consume_skb()</tt> implies that it was used in some way.  The macro
<tt>dev_kfree_skb()</tt>, intended for use in drivers, turns into a call to
<tt>consume_skb()</tt>.
<p>
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> is different: it frees the SKB unconditionally without
even looking at the reference count.  Needless to say, this looks like a
hazardous thing to do with a reference-counted data structure.  And,
indeed, that is exactly where the DCCP protocol code went wrong: it called
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> on an SKB that, with the right sequence of steps,
had another reference on it, leading to a classic use-after-free
vulnerability.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5edabca9d4cff7f1f2b68f0bac55ef99d9798ba4">The
fix</a> is a simple switch to <tt>consume_skb()</tt> instead.
<p>
A comment next to <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/core/skbuff.c#L673">the
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> implementation</a> says: 
"<q>This is an internal helper function. Users should always call
kfree_skb</q>".  A quick grep shows 94 call sites to
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> in the kernel, 46&nbsp;of which are in device
drivers.  It is not entirely implausible to think that maybe one or two of
those other calls might represent a similar bug.  Clearly some auditing is
indicated here, but it might also be time to review this somewhat irregular
reference-counting API, which seems designed to create just this kind of
vulnerability.  There are also many places in the code where the SKB
reference count is directly manipulated without using the accessor
functions; those, too, seem relatively likely to harbor bugs.
<p>
It's worth noting that this API is far from new.  The SKB reference count
was added for the 2.2 kernel in 1999, and the distinction between
<tt>kfree_skb()</tt> and <tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> was added with it,
though the former was the only caller of the latter then.  The 2.4 kernel
saw more <tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> calls within the core networking code, but
none in drivers.  The slow spread of potentially dangerous
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt> calls is the result of an API decision made nearly
twenty years ago.
<p>
Al Viro once <a href="/Articles/446631/">said</a>: "<q>Bugs are like
mushrooms - found one, look around for more.</q>"  In this case, it is
instructive to look at <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb7e2399ec17f1004c0e0ccfd17439f8759ede01">this
fix</a> to the TCP subsystem.  Masayuki Nakagawa noticed a use-after-free
problem in the TCP code resulting to an ill-advised call to
<tt>__kfree_skb()</tt>.  The problem was fixed (by calling
<tt>kfree_skb()</tt> this time) â€” in 2007, just over ten years ago.  Might
this fix have been the sort of mushroom that called out for a wider search? 
<p>
When the DCCP protocol implementation was merged in 2005, much of it was,
shall we say, heavily 
influenced by the existing TCP code.  So the function that had not yet been
fixed by Nakagawa, called <tt>tcp_rcv_state_process()</tt>, found a strong
echo in the new function <tt>dccp_rcv_state_process()</tt>; that,
naturally, is the function that was patched, in a nearly identical way, to
fix CVE-2017-6074.  In other words, a mushroom was indeed found, but nobody
thought to look in the copy-and-pasted DCCP code for a similar fungal
invasion.  An opportunity to fix a privilege-escalation vulnerability was
lost ten years ago.
<p>
This particular vulnerability was eventually unearthed with the syzkaller
fuzzer, and it is now fixed.  Fuzzing is a valuable tool for the
identification of problems like this.  But it cannot replace the simple
process of looking over the kernel code in search of bugs that are similar
to those that have been recently identified.  While our community values code
contributions and the industry tends to support developers well, we fall
down when it comes to this sort of mushroom hunting, with the result that
relatively easily identified bugs remain in the code for a decade or more.
It seems unlikely that the black-hat community is not making the effort to
look for echoes of recently fixed bugs.
<p>
Over the last year or two, there have been signs that the kernel community
is getting more serious about improving security.  Some hardening work is
finally making its way into the mainline, and tools like syzkaller are
unearthing longstanding issues.  But this vulnerability shows a couple of
areas where the kernel community could be doing a lot better than it is:
designing safer internal APIs and looking for repeated buggy patterns.  If we
truly want to be the most secure system out there, both the community and
the companies that support it may want to think about how these
shortcomings can be rectified.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Can't something like coccinelle search for such "semantic copy/paste" based on the very first fix and... find mushrooming bugs?<br>

Yes, coccinelle is awesome for finding other mushrooms. But picking them (=fixing bugs) requires a lot more attention.<br>
<p>
I used to do that. When I received a bugfix in my subsystem which looked like a generic issue to me, I wrote a coccinelle script to see how widespread it was. However, fixing it automatically was seldomly possible. Usually, the coccinelle generated patches needed manual changes and a really careful review in order to avoid regressions. The code in question was often not touched for a while, so getting it upstream without being able to test it was slow (rightfully, I'd say).<br>
<p>
That all easily exceeded the free-time capacity I had for hacking such stuff. I tried to get funding for it but failed ("no predictable deliverables"). So, I stopped writing cocci scripts because knowing where mushrooms are and then not being able to pick them gets frustrating.<br>

Well, identifying the real problems from false positives is one big chunk of the work already. coccinelle is awesome for finding points of interest, but they all need proper review and second thought. And posting lists with false positives is not a good idea IMO.<br>

<p>AddRef/DecRef, Retain/Release. There are just so many better options for naming ref counting functions. Bonus points if your AddRef/Retain function returns a pointer to the object you're increasing the ref count on, so you can do it while assigning...

"Retain" and "AddRef" are each 6 characters. "get" is 3 characters.<br>
"get" wins easily.<br>

I agree that having "get" return the pointer is a win.<br>

<p>
Yes, really.  These things are used a lot.  Common words tend to be shorter than uncommon word, and for good reason.  Less wasted space for example.<br>
It doesn't really matter what the letters are as long as they are used consistently.<br>
If you made a convention that "thing_foo" incremented the ref count and returned the pointer, and "thing_bar" decremented the refcount and discarded when it became zero, then we would all add "_foo" and "_bar" to our language fairly quickly and there would be no confusion.<br>
I could argue that would be better than the current situation where we mostly use "get" and "put", but they don't always mean quite the same thing. <br>
<p>
When new people come to the code and see "get" and "put" it might seem like it makes it easy for them.  But it can just as easily lead them to think they understand something that they don't. Using more letters might just give them more confidence that the meaning of the word is "obvious", which is probably isn't.<br>

One could think of it as getting or putting a count into the counter rather than getting a reference and the returning it. I had the same problem for the longest time with the power symbol. I saw it as 0 for a closed circuit and 1 for an open circuit. Exactly backwards.<br>

<p>
My understanding is that this convention goes way back.  At least 6th edition UNIX used iget() and iput() to maintain reference counts (e.g. see p.85 in <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/book.pdf">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/book.pdf</a>).  So it not only (probably) predates people using "retain" as the verb here, but it also predates Linux.<br>

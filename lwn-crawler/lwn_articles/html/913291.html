           </div>
The search for better performance from the kernel never ends.  Recently
there has been a stream of smaller patches that promise incremental
performance gains, at least for some types of applications.  Read on for an
overview of two of those patches, which make changes to the epoll system
calls and to NUMA balancing.  This work shows where developers are looking
for performance improvements — and that not everybody measures performance
the same way.

<p>
<h4>An epoll optimization</h4>
<p>
The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a>
family of system calls is aimed at event-loop applications that manage
large numbers of file descriptors.  Unlike <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html"><tt>poll()</tt></a>
or <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html"><tt>select()</tt></a>,
epoll allows the per-file-descriptor setup be performed once (with
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html"><tt>epoll_ctl()</tt></a>);
the result can then be used with multiple <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html"><tt>epoll_wait()</tt></a>
calls to poll for new events.  That reduces the overall polling overhead
significantly, especially as the number of file descriptors being watched
grows.  The epoll system calls add some complexity, but for applications
where per-event performance matters, it is worth the trouble.
<p>
Normally, <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> will block the calling process until at
least one of the polled file descriptors is ready for I/O.  There is a
timeout parameter, though, that can be used to limit the time the
application will remain blocked.  What is lacking, however, is a way to
specify a <i>minimum</i> time before the <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> call
returns.  That may not be surprising; as a general rule, nobody wants to
increase an application's latency unnecessarily, so <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> is
designed to return quickly when there is something to be done.
<p>
Even so,
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221030220203.31210-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">this
patch set from Jens Axboe</a> adds this minimum wait time.  It creates a
new <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> operation, <tt>EPOLL_CTL_MIN_WAIT</tt>, to specify
the shortest time that subsequent <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> calls should block
before returning to user space.  The reasoning behind this seemingly
counterintuitive capability is to increase the number of events that can be
returned by each <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> call.  Even with much of the
setup work taken out, each system call still has a cost.  In situations where
numerous events can be expected to arrive within a short time period, it
can make sense to wait for a few of them to show up and only pay the
system-call cost once.
<p>
In other words, an application may want to trade off a bit of latency for
better throughput overall.  This is seemingly a common use case; as Axboe
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221030220203.31210-7-axboe@kernel.dk/">put
it</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	For medium workload efficiencies, some production workloads inject
	artificial timers or sleeps before calling epoll_wait() to get
	better batching and higher efficiencies. While this does help, it's
	not as efficient as it could be.
</blockquote>
<p>
Using this feature, he said, can reduce CPU usage by 6-7%.  Axboe is
seeking input on the API; specifically, whether the minimum timeout should
be set once with <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt>, or whether it should instead be
provided with each <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> call.  This would be a good time
for potential users to make their preferences known.
<p>
<h4>Control over NUMA balancing</h4>
<p>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are characterized by variable
RAM access times; memory that is attached to the node on which a given
thread is running will be faster for that thread to access
than memory on other nodes in the system.  On such systems, applications
will thus perform better if their memory is located on the nodes they are
running on.  To make that happen, the kernel performs NUMA balancing —
moving pages within the system so that they are resident on the nodes where
they are actually being used.
<p>
NUMA balancing, when done correctly, improves the throughput of the system
by increasing memory speeds.  But NUMA balancing can also cause short-term
latency spikes for applications, especially if they incur page faults while
the kernel is migrating pages across nodes.  The culprit here, <a
href="/Articles/893906/">as is often
the case</a>, is contention for the process's <tt>mmap_lock</tt>.  For some
latency-sensitive applications, that can be a problem; there are,
seemingly, applications where it is better to pay the cost of suboptimal
memory placement to avoid being stalled during NUMA balancing.
<p>
For such applications, Gang Li has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221027025302.45766-1-ligang.bdlg@bytedance.com/">a
patch set</a> adding a new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
operation, <tt>PR_NUMA_BALANCING</tt>, that can control whether NUMA
balancing is performed for the calling process.  If that process disables
NUMA balancing, pages will be left where they are even at the cost of
longer access times.  Benchmark results included
in the cover letter show that the performance effects of disabling NUMA
balancing vary considerably depending on the workload.  This feature will
not be useful for many applications, but there are seemingly some that will
benefit.
<p>
The kernel development community tries hard to minimize the number of
tuning knobs that it adds to the kernel.  Each of those knobs is a
maintenance burden for the community but, more importantly, tuning knobs
are a burden for application developers and system administrators as well.
It can be difficult for those users to even discover all of the parameters
that are available, much less set them for optimal performance.  It is
better for the kernel to tune itself for the best results whenever
possible.
<p>
Patches like the above show that this self-tuning is not always possible,
at least in the current state of the art.  Achieving the best performance
for all applications gets harder when different applications need to
optimize different metrics.  Thus, one of these patches allows developers
to prioritize throughput over latency, while the other does the opposite.
This diversity of requirements seemingly ensures that anybody wanting to
get that last bit of performance out of their application will continue to
need to play with tuning knobs.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Agreed! We did this mistake of sharing epoll in haproxy for its early thread support. That lasted maybe one month before we switched to one poller per thread and never looked back. Shared epoll doesn't scale at all and causes lots of complicated races that you need to take care of in your application. No thanks, never again!<br>

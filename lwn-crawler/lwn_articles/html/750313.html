           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 29, 2018</br>
           </div>
The kernel development community has consistently resisted adding any
formal notion of what a "container" is to the kernel.  While the needed
building blocks (namespaces, control groups, etc.) are provided, it is up
to user space to assemble the pieces into the sort of container
implementation it needs.  This approach maximizes flexibility and makes it
possible to implement a number of different container abstractions, but it
also can make it hard to associate events in the kernel with the container
that caused them.  Audit container IDs are an attempt to fix that problem
for one specific use case; they have not been universally well received in
the past, but work on this mechanism continues regardless.
<p>
The audit container ID mechanism was first proposed (without an
implementation) in late 2017; see <a href="/Articles/740621/">this
article</a> for a summary of the discussion at that time.  The idea
 was to attach a user-space-defined ID to all of the processes
within a container; that ID would then appear in any events emitted by the
audit subsystem.  Thus, for example, if the auditing code logs an attempt
to open a file, monitoring code in user space would be able to use the
container ID in the audit event to find the container from which the
attempt originated. 
<p>
Richard Guy Briggs posted <a
href="/Articles/749551/">an implementation</a> of the container-ID
concept in mid-March.  In this proposal, IDs for containers are
unsigned 64-bit 
values; the all-ones value is reserved as a "no ID has been set" sentinel.  A new
file (<tt>containerid</tt>) is added to each process's <tt>/proc</tt>
directory; a process's container ID can be set by writing a new value to
that file.  There are, however, a few restrictions on how that ID can be
set:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The <tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL</tt> capability is required to change this 
     value.  The necessary capability was the subject of a fair amount of
     discussion when the container-ID idea was first floated.  The initial
     plan was to create a new capability for this specific purpose, but
     that ran into opposition.  <tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL</tt> exists to give
     access to audit filtering rules and such; extending it to cover the
     container ID wasn't the preferred option of the audit developers, but
     they seem to have accepted it in the end.
<li> A process cannot set its own container ID; that must be done by some
     other process.
<li> A process's audit ID can only be set once after the process is
     created.  This is actually implemented by allowing the change if the
     current container ID is either the all-ones flag or equal to the
     parent process's container ID.
<li> A process's container ID can only be set if the process has no
     children or threads.  The purpose of this restriction seems to be to
     prevent a process from circumventing the "can't set your own container
     ID" rule by creating a child to do it.  Since the single-set rule
     depends on comparing against the parent's container ID, allowing that
     ID to be changed for processes with children could be used to
     circumvent that rule as well.
</ul>
<p>
Once a process's container ID has been set, any subsequent child processes
will inherit the same ID.  Otherwise, the kernel does almost nothing with
this ID value, with one exception: events generated by the audit subsystem
will include this ID if it has been set.  The user-space tools <a
href="/Articles/750330/">have been patched</a> to be able to make use of
the container ID when it is present.
<p>
There is an interesting intersection between container IDs and network
namespaces, though.  Possibly interesting events can happen in a network
namespace, but some of these events can be difficult to associate with a
specific container.  The
rejection of a packet by firewall rules would be one example.  The fact
that multiple containers can exist within a single network namespace
complicates the picture here.  To address this problem, the patch set adds
a list to each network namespace tracking the container IDs of all
processes running inside that namespace.  When an auditable event occurs
involving that namespace that cannot be tied to a specific process, all of
the relevant container IDs will be emitted with the event.
<p>
One open question is whether the proposed <a href="/Articles/741261/">ptags
mechanism</a> might not be a better solution to this problem.  This patch
set is essentially enabling the application of a specific tag to processes;
ptags provides that capability in a more general way.  It is easy enough to
see why the audit developers would prefer the current path: ptags is an
out-of-tree patch that, in its current form, depends on the eternally
in-progress <a 
href="/Articles/635771/">security-module stacking</a> work.  The audit
container ID patches are, instead, relatively simple and could conceivably
be merged in the relatively near future.
<p>
The approach that some developers find easiest is not always the one the
community decides to adopt.  This time around, though, the simple approach
may well win out.  Asking the audit developers to solve the module-stacking
problem would be a tall order for even the most intransigent of kernel
developers.  If a version of this patch set is merged, though, it will
represent in a small way the first addition of the concept of a container
to the kernel; we may yet see some resistance to doing that.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

So, you have to have already started the process, and then set the ID from outside the process. That seems like a painful synchronization problem requiring a cooperative process regardless.<br>

I think that only the launcher (i.e. docker executable?) will have the CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL enabled. The other processes will just inherit the value during the fork/clone syscall.<br>

Also the process can't have started any children or threads yet.<br>
<p>
Definitely this requires cooperation, or PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC to stop it instantly (which seems like horrible overkill, but then, this whole API seems like a horrible hack to me: ptags is obviously better in every way except if you're only looking at auditing and nothing else).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; A new file (containerid) is added to each process's /proc directory; a process's container ID can be set by writing a new value to that file.</font><br>
<p>
Oh dear lord. I haven't been following the proposals as closely since they were reposted, but this is still getting really strange.<br>
<p>
I think Casey Schaufler was right in the first review cycle[1]. If we're going to add a process tagging system, we should just add a generic one (like Jose Bollo's PTAGS) and then audit can make use of it. I can think of several things that PTAGS is useful for, while I can only think of one thing that /proc/$pid/containerid would be useful for (and it wouldn't even be useful for *container runtimes* -- only for audit).<br>
<p>
From the original thread, the argument against (ab)using something like PTAGS for the purpose of audit was:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; We would love to have a generic kernel facility that the audit subsystem could use to identify containers, but we don't, and previous attempts have failed, so we have to create our own. [...] If a more general solution appears in the future I think we would make every effect to migrate to that; keeping this initial effort small should make that easier. </font><br>
<p>
Effectively being that "there isn't a generic kernel facility, nobody is willing to merge one, but we need something for audit and if there was a generic facility we would use it". Surely someone pushing for an audit-specific process tagging system (called /proc/$pid/containerid even though it's specific to audit) should be enough reason for the relevant maintainers to consider something like PTAGS more seriously?<br>
<p>
I'm sure that the PTAGS-audit integration would have some quirks (I imagine CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL will be a point of contention) but I'm sure something like "security.*" xattr namespacing would be applicable.<br>

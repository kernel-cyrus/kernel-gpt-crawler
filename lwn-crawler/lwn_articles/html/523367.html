<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>November 7, 2012</br>
           </div>
<p>
The UEFI secure boot "problem" spans multiple levels in a Linux system.
There are the actual "getting Linux to boot" issues, which have mostly been addressed by
the <a href="/Articles/519618/">two signed bootloaders</a> that are
available for distributions and users.  Beyond that, though, are a set of
kernel features that have the potential to subvert secure boot.  Depending
on one's perspective, those features either need to be configurable in the
kernel&mdash;so some distributions can turn them off in their signed
kernels&mdash;or they pose little risk beyond that of existing (but
unknown) kernel bugs.  As might be guessed, both sides of
that argument can be heard in a recent linux-kernel thread.
</p>

<p>
The root problem, so to speak, is that the root user on Linux systems is
trusted by the kernel.  That means root can make all sorts of
temporary&mdash;or permanent&mdash;changes to the state of the system.
Those changes include things like using <tt>kexec()</tt> to boot a
different operating system, or writing a hibernation image to the swap
partition for use in a resume.  But both of those things could be used by
an attacker to circumvent the protections that secure boot is meant to enforce.
</p>

<p>
If, for example, a user were to boot using one of the Microsoft-signed
Linux bootloaders&mdash;"shim" or "pre-bootloader"&mdash;into a kernel that didn't restrict root's powers, that
kernel could arrange to execute a different kernel, perhaps one that has
been compromised.  Worse yet, from the perspective of those worried about
Microsoft blacklisting bootloaders or keys, that second kernel could
actually be a malicious version of Windows.  So, a secure-boot-protected
system would end up booting mal-Windows, which is precisely the scenario
secure boot is supposed to prevent.
</p>

<p>
If that occurs in the wild, various folks believe that Microsoft will
blacklist the bootloader that was used in the attack.  If that's the same
bootloader used to boot Linux, new systems, as well as old systems that get
the blacklist update, will no longer boot Linux.  Matthew Garrett (at
least) is concerned about that scenario, so he has <a
href="/Articles/514985/">proposed kernel changes</a> that would prevent
suitably configured kernels from using <tt>kexec()</tt> among a handful of
other restrictions that could be used to circumvent secure boot.
</p>

<p>
That was back in early September, and those changes were relatively
uncontroversial except for the capability name Garrett chose
(<tt>CAP_SECURE_FIRMWARE</tt>) and the <tt>kexec()</tt> restriction.  In
mid-September, he followed up with a <a href="/Articles/523420/">set of
patches</a> that were substantially the same, though the <tt>kexec()</tt>
patch was removed and the capability was renamed to
<tt>CAP_COMPROMISE_KERNEL</tt>.  In the patch, he noted that "<q>if
anyone wants 
to deploy these then they should disable kexec until support for signed
kexec payloads has been merged</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Things went quiet for more than a month, but have since erupted into a
rather large thread. A <a href="/Articles/523424/">query from Jiri
Kosina</a> about loading firmware into a secure boot kernel led to a
discussion of the threat model that is being covered by Garrett's patch
set.  While Garrett <a href="/Articles/523426/">agreed</a> that firmware
loading should eventually be dealt with via signatures, it is not as high
on his priority list.  An automated attack using crafted firmware would be
very hardware-specific, requiring reverse engineering, and "<q>we'd
probably benefit from them doing that in the long run</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Garrett's focus on automated attacks makes it clear what threat models he
is trying to thwart, so Kosina's next query, <a
href="/Articles/523431/">about resuming from hibernation</a>, is an issue
that Garrett believes should be addressed.  It turns out that Josh Boyer
has a patch to 
disable hibernation for secure boot systems, but that, like disabling
<tt>kexec()</tt>, was not overwhelmingly popular.
</p>

<p>
There are other ways to handle resuming from hibernation, for example by creating keys at boot
time that get stored in UEFI boot variables and that the kernel uses to sign
hibernation images.  But it is clear that some kernel developers are
starting (or continuing) to wonder if the kernel secure boot support isn't
going a bit&mdash;or far more than a bit&mdash;overboard.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, as James Bottomley <a href="/Articles/523437/">pointed
out</a>, there will always be kernel bugs that allow circumvention of these
restrictions (e.g. by root reading the hibernation signing key or flipping
the 
capability bit): 
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] a local privilege elevation attack
usually exploits some bug (classically a buffer overflow) which executes
arbitrary code in kernel context.  In that case, the same attack vector
can be used to compromise any in-kernel protection mechanism including
turning off the secure boot capability and reading the in-kernel private
signing key.
<p>
[...] The point I'm making is that given that the majority of exploits will
already be able to execute arbitrary code in-kernel, there's not much
point trying to consider features like this as attacker prevention.  We
should really be focusing on discussing why we'd want to prevent a
legitimate local root from writing to the suspend partition in a secure
boot environment.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But kernel exploits appear to be "off the table", at least in terms of the
secure boot circumvention that Garrett and others are concerned about.
Kosina <a href="/Articles/523446/">said</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
My understanding is that we are not trying to protect against root 
exploiting the kernel. We are trying to protect against root tampering 
with the kernel code and data through legitimate use of kernel-provided 
[facilities] (/dev/mem, ioperm, reprogramming devices to DMA to arbitrary 
memory locations, resuming from hibernation image that has been tampered 
with, etc).
</div>
</p>

<p>
It's not exactly clear why Microsoft would make a distinction between a
kernel exploit and using legitimate kernel services when making a
blacklisting 
decision, though. But, for distributions that <i>do</i> ship signed kernels, they
can reduce the attack surface substantially: to only those kernels that
they have signed, with whatever vulnerabilities are present in those
particular versions.
</p>

<p>
Eric Paris <a href="/Articles/523449/">detailed one possible attack</a> that
installs a crafted Linux boot environment (with a legitimately signed
bootloader and kernel), which
sleeps after setting up a trojaned Windows hibernation image.  Users would
need to wake the machine twice, but would end up running malware in a
secure boot system.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley and others are, at the very least, uncomfortable with the
idea of an "untrusted root".  At the heart of the kernel changes for secure
boot is removing the ability for root to make persistent changes to the boot
environment.  The patches that Garrett has proposed close many of the known
holes that would allow root to make those kinds of changes, but the
argument is that there are likely to be others.  As Alan Cox <a
href="/Articles/523396/">put it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
 With all the current posted RH patches I can still take over
the box as root trivially enough and you seem to have so far abolished
suspend to disk, kexec and a pile of other useful stuff. To actually lock
it down you'll have to do a ton more of this.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Another possible way to handle Linux being used as an attack vector against
Windows (which is how keys are likely to get blacklisted) is to change the
behavior of the Linux bootloaders.  Bottomley <a
href="/Articles/523455/">suggested</a> that a "present user" test on the
first boot of the bootloader, which could be detected because the UEFI key
database and the "machine owner key" database do not contain the proper
keys, would alleviate the problem.  Garrett <a
href="/Articles/523456/">pointed out</a> that the shim 
bootloader does not do this because it needs to be able to boot unattended,
even on first boot.  But, Bottomley <a href="/Articles/523457/">saw
that</a> as unfortunate:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] what I'm telling you is that by deciding to allow automatic
first boot, you're causing the windows attack vector problem.  You could
easily do a present user test only on first boot which would eliminate
it.  Instead, we get all of this.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Garrett, though, sees unattended first boot as an absolute requirement,
especially 
for those who are trying to do automated installations for Linux systems.
Others disagreed, not surprisingly, and the discussion still continues.  It
should be noted that the pre-bootloader that Bottomley released <i>does</i>
do a present user test on first boot (and beyond, depending on whether the
user changes the secure boot configuration). 
</p>

<p>
There does seem to be something of whack-a-mole problem here in terms of
finding all of the ways that this "untrusted root" might be able to impact
secure boot.  In addition, new kernel features will have to also be
scrutinized to see whether they need to be disabled depending on
<tt>CAP_COMPROMISE_KERNEL</tt>.  

<p>
Not trusting root is a very different
model than kernel developers (and users) are accustomed to.  One can
imagine that all of the different problem areas will be tracked down
eventually, but it will be a fair amount of work.  Whether that work is
truly justified in support of a feature that is largely (though not
completely) only useful for protecting Windows is a big question.  On the
other hand, not being able to [easily] boot Linux on x86 hardware because of key
blacklisting would be problematic too.  This one will take some time to
play out.

I have great respect for mjg59's work and intelligence but I too think that this might be introducing far more restrictions than can be supported and more than the threat model warrants. The only thing that is checked by UEFI is the shim, correct?  Therefore that is the only thing that can be blacklisted, if it can be used to silently compromise an OS on boot, the rest is just our own leveraging of the Secure Boot feature for our own use. Secure Boot offers very limited protection on boot, nothing after boot and nothing in a virtualized environment IIUC.  It doesn't protect the kernel from being compromised and it's not intended to, it's not intended to prevent a compromised kernel from suspending/hibernating and resuming either. <br>
<p>
If one is looking for more general ways to secure a running system then there are probably other better places to look like LSM modules or grsecurity. <br>

But you aren't booting an arbitrary kernel, a cold boot will get you a verified kernel image and modules off disk. As far as the kernel being modified after boot, that's outside the scope of this protection and annother matter entirely. I've worked in security for much of my career, one of the hardest things is knowing when enough is enough, when adding more protections, restrictions and security is counter productive. I think that's the case here. <br>
<p>
If we want to work on other kernel security measures then I don't think it should be in the context of Secure Boot as that has been pushed as far as it will go and will take a few years of operational use to cool down.  You can start a new project to help prevent unauthorized entry into the kernel, making kexec do signature checking maybe, but you can't _fundamentally_ prevent code from being loaded into the kernel after users pace is started, there are too many holes for that. The kernel team does their level best to plug holes as fast as they can and that's what we have to rely on for now. <br>

Verifying the on-disk copy allows one to cold boot into a known good state, without re-imaging their machine from read-only media, at least until the point where arbitrary, user-supplied code can be run, then you are boned again.  You can also safely update the trusted base even on a compromised system, knowing that it hasn't been modified in transit, closing extant holes. You can't prevent the kernel from having holes though so you have no protections after you exit your trusted base, the best you can do is have some scanning as part of your trusted, verified base and run it early enough to catch known malware.  This does nothing for zero-day exploits and new malware though.<br>
<p>
This is a problem with no easy answers and might not even be a solvable problem given the complexity needed for modern systems.  Have you ever read Verner Vinge "Deepness in the Sky"?<br>

The point where arbitrary, user-supplied code can be run is the moment you transition into the initramfs - ie, before you can do anything with your known-good kernel. There's zero benefit in verifying the kernel if you're going to permit arbitrary userspace code to rewrite it.<br>

That's a good point, there is no benefit if the rootkit runs in the initramfs.  The only way I can see to solve that is to make the initramfs only run validated, signed code and not arbitrary code.  <br>

I'd like a clarification here: initramfs has to have a vulnerability because of:<br>
<p>
  - what it does; or<br>
  - it does so much that *something* it calls is ~100% likely to have *some* vulnerability; or<br>
  - something else?<br>
<p>
This seems like an important distinction to me, but I'm also unfamiliar with what initramfs actually does or needs to do at a detailed level.<br>

Well you have to presume the kernel has some vulnerabilities but you  can control what code calls into the kernel, at least for very early boot when the system is still being set up.  Anything that has a fixed function can get signatures and be solidified, the problems come in when you have to run arbitrary code which is outside the users ability to audit.<br>

What treat does closing these "holes" fix that wouldn't also be holes in booting a "mal-Windows" under say qemu? The mal-Windows is still not able to change any of the secure boot UEFI parameters without user intervention is it? Maybe I am not inventive/imaginative enough, but it seems there is no difference between this and running any Windows (or other OS) version under "normal" emulation. Or is there?<br>

I like the idea of having a secure boot. However, having a secure boot  where the trust anchor is an entity that has radically different, if not conflicting goals and requirements to those of Linux users is a risky proposition. I fear there are only 2 stable, extreme outcomes to this:<br>
<p>
a) Linux becomes a heavily locked down software eco-system.<br>
<p>
b) Linux becomes non-bootable on common hardware.<br>
<p>
The middle-ground some seek, I'm not sure is achievable by accepting a scheme that has such an other entity as trust anchor.<br>

I don't consider any of this UEFI-locking to be a technical problem. It's an antitrust-problem. <br>
<p>
Because the reason Microsoft does it is obviously because it tries to lock out competition. <br>
<p>
So the first thing needed to combat this, is to abolish any law that protects this kind of shenanigans, namely the DRM anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA and similar laws. And the second step is to go in with anitrust law. hard. <br>

Yes, in fact it's probably more likely.  But we've got every reason to believe they *will* treat them the same - they've revoked their own signatures (and even keys) before for windows drivers, for example.<br>

I find it weird that all the discussion is going around Microsoft. Secure boot can be a very cool thing to have even in a pure-Linux world : making sure even root cannot compromise the kernel (as in executing arbitrary code using features) is a good security property.<br>
<p>
Sure, there is a lot of work required to reach such a goal and kernel vulnerabilities will still exists (ah no, sorry, bugs...) but seccomp-bpf and others mechanisms are here to help. So why not focus on the benefits and stop refering to Windows all the time ?<br>

      The discussion often involves Windows simply because the Windows 8 logo certification rules are the carrot that's forcing us to move forward on this. You're right that there are numerous benefits, and we're trying to take advantage of them - see <a href="http://blog.uncooperative.org/blog/2012/06/25/another-benefit-of-secure-boot/">this blog post</a> for example.<br>
<br>
We're not myopically focusing on MS and Windows, but since they are the de facto CA in charge of revocation, we do need to make sure that they are satisfied that our implementation isn't a danger to Windows security as well.

<p>
If you needed to modify a restore image, or kernel, or bootloader, you would need to disable the security mechanism. (In a dream world, by a hardware switch, but more likely through some BIOS setting.)<br>
<p>
Presumably you'd need to do such dramatic things only infrequently, so the security would be worth the inconvenience.<br>

But if that's all, then what is the benefit of this scheme over simply having a small area of storage that has a hardware-read-only switch, and booting from that ?<br>
<p>
SD-cards already have hardware-write-protect switches on them, why not just put your kernel there, and set the bios to boot from the SD-card ?<br>

AFAIK the switch on an SD card doesn't actually physically prevent writing to the card; if engaged it's really more like a suggestion to the kernel to not allow writing to the card, so it wouldn't gain you additional security.

Yeah okay, in that case secure boot is as useful as making a sd-card where the write-protect physical switch actually physically prevents writing to the card. I can't imagine that is difficult to do.<br>
<p>
No changes to hardware or software beyond the SD-card itself needed.<br>
<p>
So what is the point of secure boot ? Why make something so simple (and so useless) so complicated ? What's the point of the crypto and the checksums and all the mumble-jumble ?<br>

This is correct, unfortunately. I don't know of any consumer media with hardware write protection (other than compact discs, which can be written only once..).<br>

There are USB thumb drives out there with write-protect switches that (at least supposedly) prevent the computer from writing to the drive.  I don't know what would happen if the OS decided to ignore the write-protect switch and write anyway, though.<br>

I too find it weird, is there something going on behind the scenes that I'm not aware of that would make sense?  As far as I can see our obligations for microsoft end at the shim, making sure it can't transparently load unsigned or modified code and interjected into the boot process by malware. As far as I can see that obligation has been met so there is nothing more to discuss with Microsoft. <br>

At the end of the article is the line:<br>
<p>
"On the other hand, not being able to boot Linux on x86 hardware because of key blacklisting would be problematic too."<br>
<p>
As I understand it, all UEFI systems must have the ability to disable secure boot enforcement in order to get Microsoft certification.  Is this correct?  I've read the arguments about how hardware manufacturers will screw this up and I even agree that this is likely to happen with some systems at some point.  And maybe this line was intended as shorthand for that possibility.  However, (as written), I think that line smells an awful lot like FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).<br>

It certainly wasn't meant as FUD, but it is a bit unclear. Perhaps a correction like:<br>
<p>
not being able to _easily_ boot Linux on x86 hardware<br>
<p>
would help.  If the bootloader keys get blacklisted, users will have to go into their BIOS and disable secure boot before being able to boot Linux.  That's all I was trying to say.<br>

Not FUD.  It will be on by default and we don't want users to have to go into BIOS and turn off 'security' in order to boot a livecd, or install a Linux distro.  No one is saying they can't, and if they do it will work just fine without anything special, but we don't think users want to or know how to turn off 'security'.<br>

Actually that is exactly what the article said.   Someone who just read the article and hadn't spent as much time following the issue as I (or you) would be misinformed.<br>
<p>
I was  surprised to read that as I was pretty sure that it was wrong, but then again this was an actual LWN article so maybe I was wrong.   That's why I asked for clarification.  I'm perfectly willing to accept that this was an error on the part of the original author and not an attempt at FUD.  I do, however, see it as problem in that makes it too easy for people who say that UEFI security is not an issue to easily discount the more subtle arguments about LiveCDs etc.<br>

<p>I'm not sure anti-trust is the reason, but this does raise an interesting thought. It seems that AMD may be looking to drive ARM processors into the server market<sup>[1]</sup>. The future may very well be ARM hardware instead of x86 -- already netbooks and laptops, etc. are going ARM. Is this an attempt to lock out Linux from the future computing markets if x86 wanes? And what about hybrid cores? Like big.LITTLE or the PS/3 but maybe instead x86 with a dozen ARM coprocessors (or v/v)?</p>

Linux can't be locked out of the server space in any foreseeable future, it is far too dominant, not even MS billions has been able to change that.<br>

<p>
Actually the explanation is quite simple: if a compromise is the result of a kernel exploit, Microsoft can expect (and/or demand) a bug fix&nbsp;&ndash; and revoke the key only if the vendor misbehaves. If the compromise is a "feature" of the product, this is vendor misbehavior by definition.
<p>
(I see the same at work, quite a lot&mdash;I architect security systems; this kind of behavior is built-in into the legalese of many certification processes.)

<p>
and that's fine from a certification standpoint, i suppose, but i don't really see how it changes the attack picture.  that signed kernel with a known exploit still exists, so it can still be used as an attack vector.<br>

No - in the case that it's being exploited, they'll issue DBX updates that ban that specific kernel's hash, and shim will honor DBX.<br>

The whole idea of UEFI secure boot and Linux seems to have started as an ease (possibility?) of use issue rather then due to a strong desire to improve Linux security.  That's not to say that people working on this don't also desire to improve Linux security.  Just that that might not be their primary concern.<br>

Yeah, it's fair to say we weren't planning on spending the 5 or so man-years we've spent on Secure Boot implementing it until we found out that we absolutely had to.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 24, 2011</br>
           </div>
Last week's Kernel Page included <a href="/Articles/443379/">a brief
item</a> about the hiding of kernel addresses from user space.  This
hiding has come under fire from a number of developers who say that it
breaks things (perf, for example) and that it does not provide any real
additional security.  That said, there does seem to be a consensus around
the idea that it's better if attackers don't know where the kernel keeps
its data structures.  As it turns out, there might be a better way to do
that than simply hiding pointer values.
<p>
There is no doubt that having access to the layout of the kernel in memory
is useful to attackers.  As Dan Rosenberg <a href="/Articles/444511/">put
it</a>: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I agree about the fact that kptr_restrict is an incomplete security
	feature.  However, I disagree that it lacks usefulness entirely.
	Virtually every public kernel exploit in the past year leverages
	/proc/kallsyms or other kernel address leakage to target an attack.
</div>
<p>
The hiding of kernel addresses is meant to deprive attackers of that extra
information, making their task harder.  One big problem with that approach
is that most systems out there are running stock distribution kernels.
Getting the needed address information from the distributor's kernel
package is not a particularly challenging task.  So, on these systems,
there is no real mystery about the layout of the kernel, regardless of
whether pointer values are allowed to leak to user space or not.
<p>
While all of this was being discussed, another idea came out: why not
randomize the location of the kernel in memory at boot time?  Address space
layout randomization has been used to resist canned attacks for a long
time, but the kernel takes no such measure for itself.  Given that the
kernel image is relocatable, there is no real reason why it always needs to
be loaded at the same address.  If the kernel calculated a different offset
for itself at every boot, it could subtract that offset from pointer values
before passing them to user space.  Those pointers could then be used by
tools like perf, but they would no longer be helpful for anybody seeking to
overwrite kernel data structures.
<p>
Dan has been looking into kernel-space randomization with <a href="/Articles/444556/">some success</a>; it
turns out that simply relocating the kernel is not that hard.  That said,
he has run up against a few potential problems.  The first of those is that
there is very little entropy available at the beginning of the boot
process, so the generation of a sufficiently random base address for the
kernel is not entirely straightforward.  It seems that enough bits of
entropy can be derived from the real-time clock and time stamp counter to
make it hard for an attacker to derive the base address later on, but a
real random number would be better.
<p>
Next, as <a href="/Articles/444513/">Linus pointed out</a>, the kernel is
not infinitely relocatable.  There are a number of alignment requirements
which constrain the kernel's placement, so, according to Linus, there is a
maximum of 8-12 bits of randomization available.  That means that an
exploit attempt could find the right offset after a maximum of a few
thousand tries.  Given that computers can try things very quickly, that
does not give a site administrator much time to respond.
<p>
As others pointed out, though, that amount of randomness is probably
enough.  Failed exploit attempts have a high probability of generating a
kernel oops; even if an administrator does not notice the oops immediately,
it should come to their attention at some point.  So the ability to
stealthily take over a system is gone.  Beyond that, failed exploits may
well take down the system entirely (especially if, as is the case with many
RHEL systems, the "panic on oops" flag is set) or leave it in a state where
further exploit attempts cannot work.  There is, it seems, a real advantage
to forcing an attacker to guess.
<p>
That advantage evaporates, though, if an attacker can somehow figure out
what offset a given system used at boot time.  Dan noticed one way that
could happen: 
the unprivileged SIDT instruction can be used to locate the system's
interrupt descriptor table.  That location could, in turn, be used to
calculate the kernel's base offset.  Dynamic allocation of the table can
solve that problem at the cost of messing with some tricky very-early-boot
code.  There could be other advantages to dynamically allocating the table,
though; if the table were put into the per-CPU
area, it might make the system a little more scalable.
<p>
So this problem can be solved, 
but there will, beyond doubt, be other places where it will be possible for
an attacker to obtain a real kernel-space address.  There are simply too
many ways in which that information might leak into user space.  Plugging
all of those leaks looks like one of those long-term tasks that is never
really done.  It may, however, be possible to get close enough to done that
attackers will not be able to count on knowing the true location of the
kernel in a running system.  That may be a bit of security through
obscurity that is worth having.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sounds a bit better than just 'security through obscurity'.   Random numbers are used in all public key crypto systems, and we don't describe those systems as STO.<br>
<p>
If randomization of the kernel addresses can give 8-12 bits of uncertainty and the kernel will tend to fail in obvious ways if they guess wrong, that's pretty darn good.<br>
<p>
By the by, does this 8-12 bits of uncertainty figure hold true for both 32bit and 64bit x86?<br>

i386 kernels have 1/2/3GB of kernel space to play with (minus vmalloc/fixmap/gaps/etc), amd64 kernels have 2GB (minus vsyscall/module area/etc). so for practical purposes, you could get the same amount of entropy for both cases.<br>

the issue is that that 1/2/3G of kernel space is in a total of 4G of address space, and given the size of the kernel and the alignment requirements, things are a bit limited<br>

you're wrong, the kernel image cannot be at arbitrary addresses, it *must* be in the top 2GB of the 64 bit virtual address space. i suggest you study the amd64 ABI and in particular -mcmodel=kernel.<br>

Really interesting, thank you.<br>
<p>
What I can say, the boot time offset randomization should make every running kernel different in the World, of course, until every running kernel has this feature in effect. Further, this should make automated hack attempts a bit harder.<br>
<p>
Combined to the above I came to think about this LWN.net article a while back: Persistent storage for a kernel's "dying breath", <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/434821/">https://lwn.net/Articles/434821/</a>.<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to have a snapshot of the system after an oops caused by kernel memory poking. After a while, an active and automatic detection system could be useful to analyze and put aside the easy oops snapshots. Just wondering, if anybody already does this and this way gathers valuable information?<br>

This should make bisecting a kernel problem fun, especially if the address layout only makes the problem appear on average half the time.<br>
<p>
Same with trying to reproduce a hang that locks your system only some of the time.  Did you remember to write down the random offset at boot-time just in case?<br>
<p>
There can also be interesting performance analysis implications.  Randomized userspace processes can vary a few percent in performance when randomized if poorly written (SPEC 2000 perlbench (*cough*)).  Things like taking addresses of variables and using them as keys in hash tables, etc.<br>

If the crash happens always "at the same place", and the kernel address is e.g. 4kB aligned, the lower bits would still be the same and could work as identification.<br>

... and if the crash depends on the location of kernel and simply doesn't happen on half of the boot attempts due to differences in that?  Good luck narrowing things down to commit that has caused it...<br>

So long as the Oops includes the blinding value that was in use, and you can force it for subsequent testing via kernel command-line, that should be enough.<br>

This isn't security through obscurity at all.  In "security through obscurity" you're trying to hide how the system is designed, under the theory that no one could ever find out (ha!).  This doesn't try to hide the design at all; here, you're countering an attacker even if the attacker knows this is going on (hopefully). Using unknown, easily-changed data to make a system hard to attack is well-accepted; passwords and crypto keys are also based on this idea.<br>

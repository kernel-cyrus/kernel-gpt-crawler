Among <a href="/Articles/715161/">the many features merged for the 4.11
kernel</a> was the "shared memory communications over RDMA" (SMC-R)
protocol from IBM.  SMC-R is a
high-speed data-center communications protocol that is claimed to be much
more efficient than basic TCP sockets.  As it turns 
out, though, the merging of this code was a surprise — and an unpleasant
one at that — to a relevant segment of the kernel development community.
This issue and the difficulties in resolving it are an indicator of how the
increasingly fast-paced kernel development community can go off track.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/711071/">patch set</a> that was eventually merged
(via the networking tree) for 4.11 claims a decrease in CPU consumption of
up to 60% over basic TCP sockets.  The protocol is designed in such a way
that existing TCP applications can be made to use it simply by linking them
against a special library — no code changes required.  On the other hand,
it requires bypassing much of the network stack (including firewalls,
monitoring, and traffic control) and shorting out the code that tries to
keep the networking layer from creating too much memory pressure.  In many
settings, those may be a price that users are willing to pay.
<p>
The problem, as <a href="/Articles/723074/">raised</a> by Christoph Hellwig
on May&nbsp;1, is that this RDMA-based protocol was merged without any
input from the RDMA development community; it was never posted to the
linux-rdma mailing list.  Once the RDMA developers took a look at it, they
found a number of things to dislike.  SMC-R adds a new API, rather than
using the existing RDMA APIs, for example.  It has no support for IPv6, and
the fact that it defines its own <tt>AF_SMC</tt> address family makes it
unclear how an application could ever specify whether it wanted IPv6 or
not.  (It's worth noting that missing IPv6 support has <a
href="/Articles/422649/">blocked other protocol implementations</a> in the
past).  There is also <a href="/Articles/723075/">a significant security
issue</a> with SMC-R, in that it opens read/write access to all of memory
from a remote system.
<p>
The RDMA developers, being less than pleased with all of this and feeling
that they should have been consulted prior to the merging of SMC-R, are
wanting to do something about it.  But what can actually be done is not
entirely clear at this point.  Hellwig posted <a href="/Articles/723077/">a
patch</a> marking the subsystem as "broken" and adding a strong warning
about the security issue, but that patch has not yet been merged and
probably never will be in that form.
<p>
Networking maintainer David Miller <a
href="/Articles/723078/">responded</a> that Hellwig was being
"<q>overbearing</q>" by trying to mark SMC-R as being broken, and <a
href="/Articles/723079/">added</a> that there is no possibility of changing
the API before it develops users: "<q>The API is out there already so we
are out of luck, and neither you nor I nor anyone else can 'stop' this from
happening</q>".  SMC-R, in other words, is a <i>fait accompli</i> that
cannot be removed at this point.
<p>
RDMA maintainer Doug Ledford <a href="/Articles/723081/">disagreed</a>,
noting that 4.11 has only been out since the end of April and has almost
certainly not appeared in distributions yet.  The "standard" that defines
this protocol (<a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7609/?include_text=1">RFC&nbsp;7609</a>)
is, he pointed out, just an informational posting from IBM without actual
standard status.  There is nothing, he said, that prevents recalling SMC-R
at this time.  For now, Miller has applied <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/19a0f7e37c0761a0a1cbf550705a6063c9675223">a
version of Hellwig's patch</a> 
that removes the "broken" marker but keeps the security warning.  Ledford
still <a href="/Articles/723085/">thinks</a>, though, that the option of
marking SMC-R broken (or moving it to staging) should still be on the
table.
<p>
Ledford, along with others, also complained loudly that this subsystem was
merged without having ever been brought to the attention of the RDMA
mailing list.  Miller <a href="/Articles/723089/">fired back</a> that he
had explicitly tried to slow the progress of this patch set in the hope
that it would get some 
substantive reviews, but "<q>I&nbsp;can't push back on people with silly
coding style and small semantic issues forever</q>".  He complained that
evidently nobody from the RDMA community is following the netdev mailing
list, which is where the patches were posted.
The discussion went around a bit on whether Miller should have asked the
SMC-R submitters to copy their patches to the linux-rdma list as well,
without any real agreement being reached.
<p>
The reason that there are no RDMA developers on netdev, despite the obvious
overlap between RDMA and networking, is an old story: the traffic on netdev
(150-200 messages per day) has reached a level where the RDMA developers
feel they simply cannot keep up with it.  Developers used to say the same
thing about linux-kernel, before everybody simply gave up on it
altogether.  As the community grows and the patch volume increases, this
type of process-scalability issue will move downward through the subsystem
hierarchy.  Developers stop keeping up with relevant discussions because
they cannot read all that email and still have time to actually get some
development done.
<p>
Ledford <a href="/Articles/723122/">proposed</a> a solution of sorts for
the problem of email volume: split
netdev into separate lists for core networking, Ethernet drivers, and
"netdev-packet".  Ironically, that is likely to make the sort of
communication issue that led to this discussion worse; as the development
community segregates itself into increasingly specialized lists,
communication across the community as a whole will be reduced.  In a small town,
everybody knows what everybody else is up to; that is not true in a large
city.  The kernel project resembles an increasingly large city in this
regard.
<p>

This fracturing of the kernel community has been evident for at least two
decades; it is likely to present significant scalability issues if the
kernel project continues to grow.

For the time being, <a href="/Articles/723123/">the SMC-R issue appears to
be headed toward a resolution</a>, with the RDMA developers seeing a path
by which the problems in the protocol and its implementation can be
addressed.  But this will certainly not be the last time that the
development community is tripped up as a result of developers not being
able to keep up with what their colleagues are doing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Perhaps an automated gizmo could generate weekly email reports of activity on kernel-related lists. A list manager could register kernel source paths of interest. Any patch posted to any monitored list that touches those paths would be mentioned in a weekly posting to the list that registered those paths (excluding those posted to the same list).<br>
<p>
Hooking it up to a patchwork-like web interface could be handy as well for the more web-inclined set.<br>
<p>
On the technical topic, RDMA, distributed shared memory, and non-volatile memory are going to be cross-cutting concerns with plenty of activity for a while.  HP's "the Machine" is one example system where these are deeply tied. There will be many APIs and interfaces. If history is relevant, most will go away. But the kernel still supports DECnet, so...<br>

<p>
Problem was that AF_SMC was an entirely new path (net/smc) so the ownership and appropriate recipients would have been a bit hard to track down. You could say: with lack of a specialized recipients list, broadcast, but then we go back to square one: too much traffic.<br>

I have Gmail setup listening to the linux-kernel list with a filter to tag any time 'openrisc' pops up in conversations.  This allows me to track any activity.<br>

If you don't mind using gmail, Something similar could be done to track and 'rdma' or other keywords you are interested in.  I'm sure one could get procmail to do the same.<br>

.......<br>
<p>
Hmm, why yes there is!<br>
<p>
And there's even this interesting bit of history:<br>
"The difficulty of answering that question is a contributing factor to many problems in the Linux API—for example, insufficient design review before release (with the consequence that mistakes in API designs are recognized too late), insufficient prerelease testing, poor or late documentation, and delays before kernel APIs are made available via C libraries."<br>

These development scalability issues are indeed very common. On the other hand, trying to mitigate them with a pure email, "database-free" approach is less common.<br>

Does every new API need a one-release "engagement" phase, so that it's in the kernel prior to "marriage"? A reverse deprecation, if you will?<br>
There is always going to be someone who doesn't get the memo, and is surprised.<br>
Putting some additional delay at the "ground truth" of a release would be one way to minimize that set of people.<br>

      Or everybody should get an invitation to the wedding, so that when the preacher says "speak now or forever hold your peace", you get a chance to object.

But if everyone is sent ten thousand wedding invitations per marriage window, they'll filter them straight into the bin, and you're back to the original problem of how to make them aware of the few weddings that they really didn't want to miss.<br>

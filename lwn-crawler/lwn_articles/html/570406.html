           <p>October 17, 2013</p>

<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2013-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
A number of upstream community developers and Google Android developers got
together at the 2013 Linux Plumbers Conference discuss some of the
non-graphics related out-of-tree or still-in-staging portions of the
Android patch set.  This discussion followed the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/569704/">Android graphics
microconference</a> held earlier in the day.  This article contains a
summary of the major issues discussed at this gathering.

<p>
<h4>Unified IPC with binder and kdbus</h4>
<p>

Earlier in the year, Greg Kroah-Hartman from the Linux Foundation had
expressed his goal of getting the user-space binder libraries to run
over the still-in-development <a href="/Articles/551969/">kdbus
interprocess communication mechanism</a>.
The session started with a question to
Greg: "how is that going?". Bashfully rubbing his head and getting
playfully heckled by Kay Sievers (another of the kdbus developers)
from Red Hat, Greg suggested that we maybe could check back next year. Greg
mentioned that he still has it as a goal, but Kay's concerns about the
viability of the concept have made him somewhat less confident.  At
this point Kay stepped in to describe some of the semantic differences
between the mechanisms, such as how everything in kdbus is asynchronous,
making it more like a network protocol, while binder calls block to
completion in a way that's more akin to system calls.  These differences
in behavior make it very difficult to support both modes
of operation elegantly and efficiently in one IPC mechanism.
<p>

When questioned whether this meant that binder should be 
merged upstream alongside kdbus, Greg was a bit
hesitant given the reported security concerns with using binder in a
non-Android environment. Colin Cross, one of the Android developers in
attendance, noted that the security issue is quite easy to avoid,
and wouldn't really be a problem, but from his perspective, he doesn't
see an immediate need to get binder out of staging and officially
merged upstream. Greg agreed, and also clarified there is no rush, as
he is fine with binder staying in staging for however long is
necessary.
<p>

The Android developers have often been dragged through
the mud by the community for implementing their own solutions,
focused on solving their own problems, rather than working with the
community to fix the existing infrastructure to satisfy their needs.
In that context, I
somewhat jokingly prodded Greg to explain why it is acceptable to develop kdbus
instead of fixing or expanding binder's features to support D-Bus. He
acknowledged the contradiction but repeated that kdbus really seems
to support a different model, and there isn't likely to be a clean way
to support both in one implementation.
<p>

Kay mentioned that while, in his opinion, the interfaces likely can't
be shared, he did see some hope for sharing some of the underlying
infrastructure. He was particularly keen on the concept of "sealed file
descriptors" as being something that Android could make use of. Sealed
file descriptors are used when two applications need to share memory by
passing a file descriptor; they allow the sender to "seal" the
descriptor so that the receiver can be confident that the data won't
be later modified by the sender. Kay
mentioned the parallels with Android's ashmem, which is the interface
Android uses to create shared memory regions that can be shared via file
descriptor 
passing.  At this point there was some confusion in the discussion;
while the feature does seem useful, it didn't seem to actually mirror
how Android currently uses ashmem or shared file descriptors, but it seemed
like 
maybe it would be something that might indeed become more useful once the
functionality is upstream.
<p>

I then discussed some of my reasons for being hopeful that
Greg would be able to achieve his goal. In particular, there is the
issue of binder's complexity and that there really is only one key
developer on the Android team who understands the in-kernel
binder driver. This makes binder somewhat risky since that developer
could be hit by a bus or otherwise stop participating in discussions,
making it hard to find someone to continue to maintain binder
upstream. Additionally, things like <tt>ioctl()</tt> compatibility support
are currently 
lacking in binder, and, because of its design, it's not easy for
32-bit and 64-bit applications to communicate with each other using binder.
Greg noted that everything in kdbus is 64-bit safe, but he also didn't see
why binder couldn't be fixed since it's not an official, stable API,
which caused some cross talk about how important supporting legacy
Android environments is. Colin spoke up to say it really wasn't a
big issue, since, when it's needed, the binder library could be made to query the
system and do the right thing.

<p>
With that the discussion seemed to be exhausted, with Greg saying we
should check back in next year to see if his thinking has changed.

<p>

<h4>Netfilter extensions</h4>
<p>

The next topic was netfilter extensions. JP Abgrall from Google's Android
team started with a brief background presentation (<a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LpcfW6KgqociD-CYV_gKWRCUI2y4pvyyyeQ8QeBGKu4">slides</a>)
on the "<tt>xt_qtaguid</tt>" filter he developed, along with some other
netfilter modifications Android uses (in particular, <tt>xt_quota2</tt> and
<tt>xt_idletimer</tt>) in order to 
provide per-application network data statistics in its settings interface.

<p>

When these changes were submitted to the community, it was
suggested that he look at using the already upstream <tt>xt_owner</tt> and
<tt>xt_nfacct</tt> (both of which were merged after <tt>xt_qtaguid</tt> was
developed) to 
provide the same functionality. But JP had a few concerns about the
differences between those modules, particularly
that using <tt>xt_owner</tt> and <tt>xt_nfacct</tt> would require
manipulating the firewall rules
during normal operation and would require excessive numbers of rules,
both of which could cause performance problems.
<p>

Marcel Holtmann from Intel spoke up to say that he thought the
functionality being provided was really nice and that his projects
would like to have something similar. But there were some concerns
about how it would work with control groups. JP mentioned he had briefly
looked at control groups, but they didn't seem useful. This caused some quick
debate between Marcel and JP on the particular differences between how
Android and desktop environments utilize control groups which I'm not sure
clarified much.
<p>

Eric Dumazet, also from Google, but not an Android developer, piped
in that he was a networking developer, that the functionality JP
wanted with <tt>xt_qtaguid</tt> was already upstream, and that <a
href="https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/using-nfqueue-and-libnetfilter_queue/">NFQUEUE</a>
is what they 
should be using. Since NFQUEUE pushes the packet decisions to
user space, this caused a bit of an uproar in the room, as numerous
folks were very skeptical that context switching to user space on every
packet would be particularly fast or power-efficient.

<p>
Eric reassured everyone that it wasn't a concern, and that the
enterprise world uses NFQUEUE for workloads up to some millions of packets
per second 
without trouble. After a bit of contentious back-and-forth with JP, it
seemed this issue wouldn't be resolved in the time remaining, and Eric
suggested JP come over to his side of the Google campus at a later
time to discuss it further.

<p>
Eric also asked about the out-of-tree <tt>xt_quota2</tt> usage and why it was
chosen instead of using the already-upstream <tt>xt_quota</tt>. JP mentioned
that the in-tree quota code didn't seem useful at all, and the
<tt>xt_quota2</tt> code was already implemented. Eric suggested that if the
upstream 
quota didn't work, it should be fixed instead of using <tt>xt_quota2</tt>. It
was brought up that Jan Englehardt, the developer of <tt>xt_quota2</tt> had
been contacted, and he said the <tt>xt_quota2</tt> code had been
rejected by the upstream developers. So being able to better describe the 
limitations with the upstream quota code will be needed to help
persuade upstream maintainers that the functionality in <tt>xt_quota2</tt> is
useful.

<h4>Android gadget driver and ConfigFS gadget driver</h4>

<p>
Closing out the microconference session was the
Android gadget driver and ConfigFS gadget driver discussion. To try
to liven things up a bit, Benoit Goby, of the Google Android team, and
Andrzej Pietrasiewicz from Samsung, were seated face-off style in the
front of the room for a dramatic showdown.
<p>

Benoit started off with a bit of background on the Android gadget
driver. This driver allows Android devices to provide a
number of gadget functions, such as support for the picture transfer
protocol (PTP), USB mass storage, Ethernet
(for tethering),  and more over a single USB connection. Additionally,
unlike other multi-function gadget drivers already upstream, these
multiplexed functions can be dynamically configured at run time.  The
Android gadget driver patches also provide additional functions that
the upstream kernel doesn't yet support, like the media transfer protocol
(MTP), the ADB debugger, Android 
Accessory and Android Audio gadgets. Additionally, the Android gadget
driver supports FunctionFS gadgets, which allow gadget functionality
to be implemented in user space. In fact, the adbd server has been
modified to support the FunctionFS interface, removing the need for an
in-kernel ADB function driver.
<p>

Andrzej then similarly described ConfigFS gadget as a dynamically
configurable gadget device that allows various gadget functions to be
multiplexed. It is different from the Android gadget driver in
that it uses <a href="/Articles/148973/">ConfigFS</a> for setting up and
changing the configuration of 
the various functions. Andrzej talked a bit about the history of the
ConfigFS gadget, noting that he originally had taken the Android gadget
driver, removed anything that was Android-specific, renamed it
Configurable Composite Gadget (CCG) and got it merged into staging.
However, when upstream maintainers pushed for use of the ConfigFS
interface, the CCG driver was abandoned and Andrzej, along with
Sebastian Andrzej Siewior, focused on the ConfigFS gadget
implementation.  As of 3.10, the ConfigFS gadget is upstream, however
it's still missing some desired functionality, like the FunctionFS
interface support.

<p>
When asked if he had any issues with the ConfigFS gadget as being a
potential upstream replacement for the Android gadget driver, Benoit
said he had no objections. Once FunctionFS support and the other
Android specific out-of-tree functions, like MTP were merged, it was
just a matter of changing Android's user space code to support it.

<p>
Discussion then moved to exactly what the best approach would be for
upstreaming the Android-specific gadget functions, like ADB, MTP,
Android Accessory and Android audio support. Benoit mentioned again
that adbd already supports FunctionFS, so once FunctionFS support is
added to the ConfigFS gadget then an ADB function isn't necessary. He
also said the MTP implementation could probably be done in user space,
but it wasn't clear if that was the best way forward. The Android
Accessory function would probably still need to be merged, but
the Android Audio interface, he thought, could likely be replaced with
a different audio function (though specifically which one and if it
was upstream was a little unclear).
<p>

When asked if this all sounded reasonable, Andrzej simply agreed,
making this one of the least contentious topics of the day. While it
didn't have the lively fireworks hoped for to keep folks awake at the
end of a long week, it was a nice and optimistic way to end the
planned discussions.
<p>

I'd like to thank everyone for attending and participating in the
discussions, as well as Zach Pfeffer and Karim Yaghmour for
co-organizing the microconference, and helping with the note taking

Right. I don't believe the MTP implementation is Android specific, its just that there isn't an upstream in-kernel MTP gadget implementation. Though there isn't an upstream in-kernel PTP implementation either, so it may be that the best route is to look at MTP userland implementations via something like FunctionFS (much as there are various userland PTP via gadgetfs implementations - for example: <a href="http://www.open-technology.de/index.php?/pages/ptp-gadget.html">http://www.open-technology.de/index.php?/pages/ptp-gadget...</a>).<br>

There has been a bit of debate over the years as to whether PTP/MTP is better done in kernelspace or userspace, it's a bit similar to NFS or FTP in that regard. Actually this dilemma goes for both host and client side of PTP/MTP too. At the kernel summit there was a brief discussion on userspace interfaces and I said I think if I did MTP host-side today I would have put atleast parts of it in kernelspace (libmtp is 100% userspace today) and that is primarily because it has some really low-level hardware quirks to it in the USB facing layer.<br>
<p>
The Android MTP responder (device-side) is partly put in userspace because that makes it easier for people to slot in a custom version of it, such as Microsofts MTP implementation with all their DRM and stuff, and vendors may want to use this as a way to get DRM support. (Whether this is good or bad is a political question.) I don't know if Androids DRM scheme utilize this.<br>

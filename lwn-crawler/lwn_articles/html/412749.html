<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 2, 2010</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2010/">2010 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
The Kernel Summit discussion on the out-of-tree code problem deliberately
avoided checkpoint/restart for a simple reason: a separate session had been
scheduled to talk about that subsystem.  Checkpoint developer Oren Laadan
gave an overview of the code and led a discussion about its prospects for
inclusion into the mainline kernel.  He left with a clear set of next steps
for getting this feature merged.
<p>
Checkpoint/restart allows the state of a set of processes to be saved to
persistent storage, then restarted at some future time, possibly on a
different system.  It has a number of potential uses, including
fault-tolerant systems, debugging (it's a sort of "super core dump"), fast
application startup, testing, and as a kind of "generic time machine."
That last one allows for the important use case of checkpointing a game,
then restoring it after a move which proves to be a mistake.
Checkpoint/restart can also be used as a sort of application-level suspend
feature; it can function as a kind of "smart swap" which can move an
application entirely out of memory when the need arises.  There is also the
interesting prospect of saving a desktop session on a USB key, then
restarting it on an entirely different system in a different location.
<p>
There is a lot of interest in this feature.  NCSA is incorporating it into
its <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/BlueWaters/">BlueWaters</a>
supercomputer.  Canonical is also working it into its Ubuntu Enterprise
Cloud distribution.
<p>
In the past, concerns have been raised about the long-term maintainability
of the checkpoint/restart subsystem, so Oren spent a fair amount of time
talking about that topic.  It currently consists of about 100 patches, with
about 23,000 lines of code spread throughout the kernel tree.  There is a
big test suite which 
goes along with it and which can catch many kinds of regressions.  In
general, Oren says, keeping up with kernel changes has not been a big
problem; it's mostly a matter of supporting new kernel features.
Maintaining it in the long term will require that developers understand it
well enough at least to understand when a change will affect
checkpoint/restore code and notify the maintainers.  
<p>
Andrew Morton said that this feature will impact many subsystems in the
kernel.  It's not something which can be imposed through a big, central
merge.  So, he asked the room to consider whether, as a whole, the feature
is worth the cost that will come with merging it into the mainline.
<p>
Tony Luck tried to get a sense for the limits of the code by asking what
types of processes will never be supported for checkpointing.  The answer
was that anything which works directly with hardware will be hard to
checkpoint properly, so they don't plan to try.  There are also some parts
of <tt>/proc</tt> which will remain forever off-limits.
<p>
James Bottomley asked what the smallest useful patch would be.  After all,
100 patches is an awful lot to dump on the community; it's unlikely that
such a set will ever be reviewed.  Oren said that the project started with
a minimal series some years ago; the response they got was that it looked
like an interesting toy, but that the developers wanted to see what the
whole solution would look like.  Eventually they got to something which
looks like a reasonably complete implementation and they are now hearing
that it's too large and they should post something minimal instead.  Ted
Ts'o responded that a minimal patch makes more sense now that the larger
implementation is available to anybody who wants to look at it.
<p>
Andrew said that, once we start merging the checkpoint/restart code, we're
committing ourselves to the whole series.  So there may not be any real
point to starting with a minimal patch.  The only reason to go that way
would be limitations on how much code can be reviewed at any given time.
<p>
Linus asked Oren to start with a small patch which is focused mainly on
changes to existing code within the kernel.  Oren will post this patch,
possibly within the week, and the discussion on merging should begin in
earnest.

100 patches is a lot but they weren't "[dumped] on the community". They've evolved over time with 21 postings in 1.75 years (as of v21 back in May):<br>

(showing that, for example, the 13th posting [v13] had 18 patches and added about 5000 lines)<br>

      Sorry, it wasn't meant to be done that way.  No, this isn't some sort of random code dump, apologies if my wording made it look that way.

Containers and checkpointing are seriously exciting features.  I have all sorts of oddball uses in mind for them.  Wishing Oren Laadan the best of luck in getting these features merged cleanly.<br>

<h1>Controlling block-I/O latency</h1>

Chris Mason and Josef Bacik led a brief discussion on the block-I/O
controller 
for control groups (cgroups) in the filesystem track at the 2018 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.  Mostly they were just
aiming to get feedback on the approach they have taken.  They are trying to
address the needs of their employer, Facebook, with regard to the latency
of I/O operations.

<p>
Mason said that the goal is to strictly control the latency of block I/O
operations, but that the 
filesystems themselves have priority inversions that make that difficult.
For Btrfs and XFS, they have patches to tag the I/O requests, which mostly deals
with the problem.  They have changes for ext4 as well, but those are not
quite working yet.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Bacik said the current block-I/O controller does not work for the company's
use case. 
Facebook wants to be able to specify a latency target for a cgroup; if at any
point that target is being exceeded, other cgroups should have their I/O
throttled.   The throttling is done by reducing the amount of I/O that is
allowed to be in-flight for the other groups.
</p>

<p>
Kent Overstreet asked why this isn't done in an I/O scheduler.  Bacik said
Facebook wants to protect a certain workload, at the expense of any others.
Mason noted that the workloads are already put 
together using cgroups, so there is no reason to create an I/O scheduler.
Dave Chinner said that the use case is only concerned with throttling, not
scheduling. 
</p>

<p>
There is an issue of throttling filesystem-initiated I/Os for metadata and swap,
Bacik said. 
The code is inserting delays into those in order to throttle that I/O when
needed.  That code is not yet present in XFS, Mason said; it was simply
poked into 
Btrfs for testing.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara said that this code should probably only be used with the no-op
scheduler or
another simple I/O scheduler.  That is what is recommended for XFS anyway,
Chinner 
said.  Bacik said that CFQ is not used at Facebook, even on spinning disks, as it will
cause latency spikes for no apparent reason.  He said that Facebook wants to be
able to use writeback throttling together with latency throttling; it is
not working correctly at the moment, but was earlier, so he will figure it
out and fix it.
</p>

<p>
There are actually two separate use cases; one is the protected workload,
but the other is for shared workloads.  In the latter case, both the
maximum latency and maximum I/O rate settings will be used.  The
latter will be for setting expectations, Mason said.  If you end up giving
100MB per second most of the time, people will come to expect that rate and
applications will fail when it occasionally drops from there.  But if you
always give 20MB per second, the applications will scale their I/O to
accommodate that.
</p>

<p>
Hearing no major objections to the idea, Bacik said he would post patches
in a week or two after the summit.  Chinner asked his usual question about
tests; Bacik said that he had some scripts that he wrote in xfstests
style.  He will add those tests to the patch set.

Is no-op similarly recommended for btrfs and ext now? If not, what is?<br>

We've benchmarked various schedulers and ext4 still benefits a lot from a good scheduler on rotating rust. Btrfs and xfs less so, but they also are quite slower than ext4 after a while because of all the fragmentation.<br>
<p>
No-op is the fastest scheduler on SSDs for all filesystems.<br>

Can the filesystem guarantee that, if I switch to noop, latency-sensitive small ops won't get starved by large, throughput-sensitive ops?<br>
<p>
Our IMAP server transfers large mailboxes to clients on slow connections. It also checks a tiny database any time someone tries to authenticate. We kept seeing weird authentication timeouts and noticed it only happened while a user was downloading a large mailbox. This was on VMs that used noop I/O scheduling, because (we thought at the time) scheduling I/O twice would be wasteful.<br>
<p>
We switched those systems to CFQ and the authentication timeouts went away. Maybe this hurt other use cases, but so far (~6 months) we've had no complaints about it.<br>

I/O schedulers use per-process queues, so for the host, requests from the VM come from the same process. If you want to discriminate processes running in the same VM, you have to run an I/O scheduler in the VM.<br>

<h1>The FUSE BPF filesystem</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>July 11, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html">Filesystem
in Userspace</a> (FUSE) framework can be used to create a "stacked"
filesystem, where the FUSE piece adds specialized functionality
(e.g. reporting different file metadata) atop an
underlying kernel filesystem.  The performance of such filesystems leaves a
lot to be desired, however, so
the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230418014037.2412394-1-drosen@google.com/">FUSE
BPF filesystem</a> has been proposed to try to improve the performance to
be close to that of the underlying native filesystem.  It came up in the
context of a <a href="/Articles/932060/">session on FUSE passthrough</a>
earlier in the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, but the details of FUSE BPF were more
fully described by Daniel Rosenberg in a combined filesystem and BPF
session on the final day of the summit.
</p>

<p>
Rosenberg said that he wanted to introduce the filesystem, describe its
current status, and discuss some of the open questions with regard to
future plans for it.  The goal is for a stacked FUSE filesystem to come
as close to the native filesystem's performance as the FUSE BPF developers
can get. In addition, they want to keep "all of the nice ease-of-use of
FUSE", with its "defined entry points"; the idea is to keep the interface
"similar to what you would see from the FUSE daemon".
</p>

<a href="/Articles/937828/">

</a>

<p>
He put up a diagram showing what classic FUSE stacked filesystem does,
which requires a "transition to and from user space several times" for each
operation. The application makes a system call that reaches the FUSE
driver in the kernel, which calls back out to the user-space FUSE daemon
(for handling the specialized functionality).
The FUSE daemon then makes another system call to the lower filesystem.
The difference for 
FUSE BPF is that the in-kernel FUSE driver can use BPF to perform any
filtering or other functionality for each operation in the kernel, then
call directly into the 
VFS layer for the lower filesystem.  If the FUSE functionality cannot be
performed in BPF for some reason (e.g. consulting a database is required),
it can call out to the FUSE daemon for the pre- and post-filtering.
</p>

<p>
The pre- and post-filters are what provide the functionality specific to
that FUSE 
filesystem, whatever it is.  For Android, which is where FUSE BPF is being
used, there are specific directories that are being hidden using the
filtering.  You could also imagine a filter that changes the data being
read in order to hide something from the applications.
</p>

<p>
The implementation uses the <a href="/Articles/811631/">BPF operation
structures</a> (<tt>struct_ops</tt>) to replace certain kernel operations
with the BPF filters.  Those filters 
mostly access structures that contain the arguments for the operation,
though there is a special buffer type to contain variable-length arguments,
such as strings or data buffers.  The BPF programs have 
the option of falling back to the normal FUSE path if desired.
</p>  

<p>
One of the
benefits of the operation-structure approach is that the FUSE BPF
filesystem only needs to provide code for the operations it wants to
intercept.  In a "very dumb example that you would never actually want to
do", a stacked filesystem that simply adds a character to the end of all file
names would only need to implement filters for the lookup and
directory-read operations. 
</p>

<p>
In order to use FUSE BPF, the <tt>struct_ops</tt> program needs to be
registered with the system using <a
href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/bpf/bpftool/Documentation/bpftool-struct_ops.rst"><tt>bpftool</tt></a>.
After that, either at mount or lookup time, the program needs to be
associated with the inode or dentry of interest using a file
descriptor for the backing file or directory in the lower filesystem.  The
developers are willing to entertain other ideas of ways to identify the
backing file, but a file descriptor was easy for their use case. 
</p>

<p>
Rosenberg put up a table of benchmarks that used a tmpfs RAM-based
filesystem as the lower filesystem, which exaggerates the performance
improvements that 
are seen.  The benchmarks show near-native performance, but with a more complex
lower filesystem, the performance improvements
much smaller, he said.  He asked Paul
Lawrence, who had run the benchmarks, if he wanted to comment.  Lawrence
agreed that the tmpfs testing showed a much larger benefit from FUSE BPF
versus regular FUSE than would be seen in more realistic testing. 
</p>

<p>
Rosenberg said that there are some things that they are still working on.
One big thing on their to-do list is to perform the operations using the
credentials of the FUSE daemon.  There are additional FUSE opcodes,
including the <tt>ioctl()</tt> opcode, that need to be implemented.  Beyond
that, some of the pre- and post-filters "are not fully hooked up"; he is
waiting to see if some of that needs to change before rolling it out to all of
the different opcodes.
</p>

<p>
Aleksa Sarai said that io_uring had some similar problems with credentials,
so he suggested looking at what those developers did as a model; he thought
that it involved creating a thread from the process whose credentials
should be used.  But
Christian Brauner said that, for the&nbsp;6.4 kernel, he had merged a
generic API called "user 
workers" for doing this kind of
credential handling.  Rosenberg said that he was
"all for using pre-existing stuff".
</p>

<p>
Lawrence said that thread and worker-queue switching on Android leads to a
huge increase in
latency, to the point where it cannot be shipped.  They had run into
problems with <a 
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>
due to its worker threads, for example.  But he thinks the FUSE BPF
credential problem can be solved fairly simply by running the I/O in the
context of the FUSE daemon.  That is the normal FUSE model, so he thinks
FUSE BPF should stick with it. 
</p>

<p>
One attendee asked about the optional pre- and post-filters in user space;
if you are going to have to pay the price to call out to user space anyway,
does it make 
sense to just do all the processing there?  Rosenberg
said that one 
transition between kernel and user space can still be saved in that case,
though there 
is less of a benefit.  But the reason that you are doing the
filtering in user space is probably because there is a lot of work that
needs to be done in the filter, the attendee said.  Lawrence said that in
the Android use case, there are just some small pieces that need to be
handled with the user-space filters and the vast majority of the file
operations will use the BPF filters and stay in the kernel, saving the
transition cost. He did acknowledge that there might be a better way to
handle that, but that they had found it useful to have the user-space
filters for Android.
</p>

<p>
Josef Bacik wanted to confirm his understanding of what features FUSE BPF
would add.  In particular, there are two separate pieces: adding the
ability to pass operations directly to the underlying filesystem using the
file-descriptor registration and the ability to attach the BPF pre- and
post-filters for the operations on the upper filesystem.  For
filesystem-passthrough purposes, the lookup operation could open the
underlying file, then associate that descriptor, and all of the rest of the
operations would go directly to the underlying filesystem.  Rosenberg
agreed with that, noting that there would not be any BPF needed for
handling passthrough.
</p>

<p>
Another attendee wondered if the only way to do the association was at
lookup time; for the <a href="/Articles/933616/">composefs use case</a>, it
would be better done when the file is opened.  Lawrence said that Meta had
already asked that FUSE BPF move away from requiring file-descriptor
registration and that a path should be used instead, so that the
association can be done without an open file.  The plan is to change to
using a path relative to a file descriptor (either of which can be null)
for the association, which is the usual convention for the <tt>*at()</tt>
system calls.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of allowing association at either lookup or open
time, but Lawrence said that they have not looked into that deeply yet.  It
was fairly straightforward to only allow associating files at lookup time,
but it may make sense to broaden that.  Brauner said that adding
association at open time would really complicate the code; he suggested
keeping the implementation simple, at least for now.
</p>

<p>
Sarai said that it was important to use the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html"><tt>openat2()</tt></a>
resolve flags when the switch was made to do relative lookups.  There are
classic problems when resolving paths that can allow malicious programs to
access parts of the filesystem that should not be allowed.  If the proper
resolve flags are used, that should easily eliminate those kinds of escapes.
</p>

<p>
Rosenberg said that, currently, there is a problem falling back to regular
FUSE because the BPF code uses a FUSE node ID of zero when it creates
nodes, but FUSE does not 
understand that value.  There needs to be a way to reserve a block of node
IDs for BPF to use, but it is not a problem that they have encountered so
it has been deferred.  There are also two issues with the
<tt>struct_ops</tt>: there is no module support for them, so he has hacked
around that, and there are a whole raft of <tt>struct_ops</tt> callbacks
needed, which required him to allocate two pages of memory to hold them
all.  Those both need to be cleaned up.
</p>

<p>
They have some plans for upstreaming the code.  The patch set is rather
large at this point, with more than&nbsp;30 patches, he said, which he is
trying to arrange to make them as easy as possible to review.  The current
organization has the passthrough patches first, with the BPF pieces coming
later in the patch series.
</p>

<p>
Bacik suggested that he split the series into two, with the
passthrough pieces as the first.  When he tried to review the current
series, it was difficult to grasp that FUSE BPF is made up of two separate
things.   He recognizes that it is a single project from their perspective
but it would help him and perhaps others to break things up.  Rosenberg
acknowledged that, but 
noted that the Android developers do not have a use for the pure
passthrough version, though it is a good intermediate point.
</p>

<p>
Brauner asked why the passthrough piece was useful at all, but Amir
Goldstein emphatically said "I don't understand, it's <i>so</i>
useful".  Once a file has been looked up or opened, all of its I/O can be
passed through directly to the filesystem; he suggested that providing
passthrough
for directory operations would also be useful, but others were less
sure. Miklos Szeredi agreed that file passthrough was useful, while Bacik
thought that all of it was, just that it should be broken up for review
purposes.

Without being "that person" but I didn't ask why that piece was useful at all. I specifically asked that I didn't understand why they thought this wasn't useful. Because it seemed useful to me. Amir just supported my question iirc. May the video prove me wrong or right. :)<br>

Really?<br>

BPF is a terrible environment for anything complicated. It doesn't even have native unbounded loops for string operations.<br>

At this point, the kernel is recapitulating the story of the JavaScript in the browser. It also started as a simple way to write short snippets of code to do online validation and similar kinds of stuff.<br>

<p>
In addition to avoiding possible attacks with RESOLVE_BENEATH (something I suspect most FUSE filesystems using this feature would want to set), being able to use RESOLVE_IN_ROOT would let you implement composefs by just having a BPF map for path -&gt; hash and you could then redirect to the blob *safely* with no userspace involvement. You could even implement lazy-pulling by only filling the map with blobs that are present locally, and then returning to userspace to pull new blobs from the internet (and then adding the blob to the map).<br>
<p>
Metadata could be in a separate map and filled in getattr (I don't know if composefs would store metadata separately, but that's the current on-paper design for the new OCI image-format ideas I've been working on). I suspect this would still be a little bit slower on lookup than a dedicated composefs, but given the other usecases for this, it is nice you can implement composefs on top of it and ultimately the main benefit is the basically no-overhead in-kernel read and write performance. <br>
<p>
fuse-overlayfs could also benefit from this pretty massively by using RESOLVE_IN_ROOT with some special handling for copyup (though overlayfs in newer kernels has FS_USERNS_MNT, which removes some of the need for fuse-overlayfs).<br>

I wonder if it could be used to make a case-sensitive filesystem look like case-insensitive<br>

Everything will be fine until someone has a situation where the lower fs contains a.txt and A.txt in the same directory...<br>

It sounds like file passthrough would potentially play well with overlay2 filesystem too. For smaller files, copy the file once and do passthrough with file name/path remapping. For larger files, do passthrough when opened only for reads (so long as you can invalidate if someone else then opens for write).<br>
<p>
I wonder why fuse doesn't use a vDSO model to avoid one of the syscalls, or both for light weight cases. Presumably data structures too complex to expose directly to user space, too sensitive, and/or hard to synchronise.<br>

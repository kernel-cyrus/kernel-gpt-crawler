           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2020-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
One of the many unfortunate consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was the
cancellation of the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2020">2020
GNU Tools Cauldron</a>.  That loss turned out to be a gain for the <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>, which
was able to add a GNU Tools track to host many of the discussions that
would have otherwise occurred at Cauldron.  In that track, Ian Bearman
presented his group's work using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">profile-guided
optimization</a> with the Linux kernel.  This technique, which he often
referred to as "pogo", is not straightforward to apply to the kernel, but
the benefits would appear to justify the effort.
<p> 
Bearman is the leader of Microsoft's GNU/Linux development-tools team,
which is charged with supporting those tools for the rest of the company.
The team's responsibilities include ensuring the correctness, performance,
and security of those tools (and the programs generated by them).  Once
upon a time, the idea of Microsoft having a GNU tools team would have
raised eyebrows.  Now, he said, about half of the instances in the
Microsoft cloud are running Linux, making Linux a big deal for the company;
it is thus not surprising that the company's cloud group is his team's
biggest customer.
<p>
There was recently, he said, an internal customer working on a new Linux-based
service that asked his team for performance help.  After some
brainstorming, the group concluded that this
would be a good opportunity to use profile-guided optimization; the
customer would have control of the whole machine running the service and
was willing to build a custom kernel, making it possible to chase
performance gains at any level of the system.  But there was a small
problem in that the customer was unable to provide any code to allow
workload-specific testing.
<p>
<h4>Optimization techniques</h4>
<p>
From there, Bearman detoured into a "primer"  on a pair of advanced
optimization techniques.
Profile-guided optimization is a technique where the compiler can
be told how to optimize a program based on observations of its run-time

<a href="/Articles/830308/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/lpc/IanBearman-sm.png" alt="[Ian Bearman]"
title="Ian Bearman" class="rthumb"></a>

performance.  In any given program, not all parts will be executed as
often as others; some parts, indeed, may not be run at all.  Using profile
data, the 
compiler can separate off the rarely used code and optimize its compilation
for space.  Hot code, instead, can be fully optimized and allowed to take
more space in the process.  Hot code and data can be laid out next to each
other in the address space.  The result is better performance overall,
greater locality, better use of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and less
disk I/O for paging.
<p>
Link-time optimization is a different technique.  Normally, the compiler
only sees one file at a time, and is thus only able to optimize code within
that one file.  The linker then assembles the results of multiple
compilation steps into the final program.  Link-time optimization works by
allowing the compiler to process the entire program at once, delaying the
optimization and code-generation steps until all of the pieces are
available.  The result can be significant performance improvements.
<p>
The two techniques can work together, he said, with impressive results.
Some work to optimize a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Performance_Evaluation_Corporation">SPEC
benchmark</a> yielded a 5% performance gain with link-time optimization,
and a 20% gain when profile-guided optimization was added as well.  That is
fine for a standalone application, but Bearman wanted to apply these
techniques to the kernel, where few have dared to tread.  Some digging
around turned up two papers published by Pengfei Yuan (and collaborators)
in 2014 and 2015; the latter claimed an average speedup of&nbsp;8%.  So the
technique seemed worth a try.
<p>
<h4>Optimizing the kernel</h4>
<p>
The work was done on an Ubuntu 19.10 system, using the toolchain shipped
with the distribution.  Link-time optimization was not entirely
straightforward to set up;
in the end, some assistance from Andi Kleen, who has been <a
href="/Articles/512548/">working on kernel link-time optimization for
years</a>, was necessary.  Getting profile-guided optimization working was
relatively easy, instead, just requiring some trial-and-error work.
<p>
The team proceeded by instrumenting the kernel, then running it with
various workloads of interest.  The kernel supports <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.8/dev-tools/gcov.html">profiling
with gcov</a>; that provided much of the information that was needed.  He
cautioned that anybody wanting to repeat this work should take care to
turn off the profiling options and rebuild the kernel after the data has
been gathered, or the result will not be as optimized as one might like â€”
words that sounded like the voice of experience.  Getting the profile data
into the compiler was a bit challenging; GCC expects it to be in a specific
location with a complicated name.  One file crashed the compiler, and
various "other glitches" were encountered as well.
<p>
Much of the testing was done with the <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>
database on a 5.3 kernel.  Just building the kernel with the <tt>-O3</tt> option
turned out to make performance worse.  The kernel that had been optimized
with link-time and profile-guided optimization, though, outperformed the
standard kernel by 2-4% on all but one test (that last test regressed
performance by about 0.5%).  This, he said, was an impressive performance
gain, especially since Redis doesn't actually spend all that much time in
the kernel.
<p>
Bearman's conclusion from this work is that use of these techniques with
the kernel is worth the trouble.  Windows relies heavily on profile-guided
optimization with its kernel, he said, and gets 5-20% performance
improvements in return.  Linux could perhaps get results of this
magnitude as well.  There is a "cyclic dependency" that is inhibiting the
use of these tools with the Linux kernel; profile-guided optimization is
not being heavily used, so people don't see the value in it.  That results
in compiler developers not putting in the effort to make it work better, so
it remains unused.  If more developers were to put in the effort to apply
profile-guided optimization, perhaps that cycle could be reversed to the
benefit of the entire community.

I am eagerly waiting for kernels to be regularly compiled with link-time optimization at least, since the prospects of it generating smaller binaries could help a lot with booting more armv5 machines (the space for the kernel file is limited when loading it with the bootloader).<br>
<p>
If the kernel also happens to use fewer bytes in memory, that is a very nice side effect that could be left to userspace in memory constrained machines, so much better. In fact, this would also help with the kernel that phones use (I&#x27;m thinking of lineageos here). A leaner kernel would mean less thrashing, which can only be a good thing. I hope that Apps that use NDK can also switch to LTO in the relatively near future.<br>
<p>
Having distribution kernels with PGO for regular computers enabled seems to also be very nice. I really, really hope that we&#x27;re not far from that being the bread-and-butter of kernel compilation.<br>
<p>
Also talking about compiler optimizations, in the last few days I read about a new approach that was just merged in (see <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/94faadac">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/94faadac</a>) LLVM called machine function splitter. It seems to be roughly based on the observation that not all hot functions have all their parts hot. It would be lovely to get something similar in GCC.<br>
<p>
In fact, if you think about it, many of the optimizations (like reducing the code for little machines like armv5) may also help significantly the code for big, compute-intensive, cloud applications and, so, everyone would benefit from that...<br>

Don&#x27;t know any details, but the LLVM pass sounds similar to gcc&#x27;s -freorder-blocks-and-partition<br>
<p>
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve paging and cache locality performance.<br>

We&#x27;ve reached out to Ian about collaborating on LTO integration; we&#x27;re in the process of upstreaming LTO patches for LLVM and need help from the GCC side to test and sort out what issues they might run into: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdkbkvXdfXLzTNOj8m8_YWjL6=bSn4-AbRyd-5oYGJVNSw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdkbkvXdfXLzTNOj8m8_YWj...</a><br>

<p>
A kernel bug that was found&mdash;and fixed&mdash;in 2007 has recently
reared its head again.  Unfortunately, the bug was reintroduced in 2008,
leaving a rather large pile of kernel versions that are vulnerable to a
local privilege escalation on x86_64 systems.  Though perhaps difficult to do, it would seem
that some kind of regression testing suite for the kernel might be able to
detect these kinds of problems before they get released to the world.
</p>

<p>
There are two semi-related bugs that are both currently floating
around, which is 
causing a 
bit of confusion. One was originally <a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4573">CVE-2007-4573</a>,
and was reintroduced in a cleanup
patch in June 2008.  The reintroduced vulnerability has been tagged as
<a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3301">CVE-2010-3301</a>
(though the CVE entry is simply reserved at the time of this writing).  Ben
Hawkes found a somewhat similar
<a href="http://sota.gen.nz/compat1/">vulnerability</a>&mdash;also
exploiting system calls from 32-bit binaries on 64-bit x86
systems&mdash;which led him to the discovery of the reintroduction of
CVE-2007-4573.
</p>

<p>
There are numerous <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/311630/">pitfalls</a>
when trying to handle 32-bit binaries making 
system calls on 64-bit systems.  Linux has a set of 
functions to handle the differences in arguments and calling conventions
between 32 and 64-bit system calls, but it has always been tricky to get
right.  What we are seeing today are two instances where it wasn't done
correctly, and the consequences of that can be dire.
</p>

<p>
The 2007 problem stemmed from a mismatch between the use of the
<tt>%eax</tt> 32-bit register to store the system call number (which is
used as an index into the syscall table) and the use of the <tt>%rax</tt>
64-bit register (which contains <tt>%eax</tt> as its low 32 bits) to do the
indexing.  In the
"normal" system call path, <tt>%eax</tt> was zero-extended before the
32-bit system call number from user space was stored, but there was a
second path into that code where the upper 32 bits in <tt>%rax</tt> were
not cleared.

<p>
The <tt>ptrace()</tt> system call has the facility to make other system
calls (using the <tt>PTRACE_SYSCALL</tt> request type) and also gives a user the
ability to set register values.  An attacker could set the upper 32 bits of
<tt>%rax</tt> to a value of their choosing, make a system call with a
seemingly valid index (in <tt>%eax</tt>) and end up indexing somewhere
outside of the syscall table.  By arranging to have exploit code at the
designated location, the attacker can get the kernel to run his code.

<p>
The <tt>ptrace()</tt> path was
<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=176df2457ef6207156ca1a40991c54ca01fef567">fixed
by Andi Kleen</a> in September 2007 by ensuring that <tt>%eax</tt> (and
other registers) were zero-extended.  But zero-extending <tt>%eax</tt> was
removed in Roland McGrath's <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.35.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=d4d67150165df8bf1cc05e532f6efca96f907cab">clean
up patch</a> in June 2008.  When Hawkes and Robert Swiecki recently noticed
the problem, they had little difficulty in <a
href="http://sota.gen.nz/compat2/">modifying an exploit</a> from 2007 to
get a root shell on recent kernels.
</p>

<p>CVE-2010-3301 was resolved by a pair of patches.  McGrath <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=eefdca043e8391dcd719711716492063030b55ac">put</a> the
zero-extension of the <tt>%eax</tt> register back into the ptrace path,
while H. Peter Anvin <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=36d001c70d8a0144ac1d038f6876c484849a74de">made</a>
the validity test of the system call number look at the entire
<tt>%rax</tt> register.  Either would be sufficient to close the current
hole, but Anvin's patch will prevent any new paths into the system call
entry code from running afoul of this problem in the future.

<p>
The fact that the old exploit was useful implies that someone could
have written a test case in 2007 that might have detected the
reintroduction of the problem.  A suite of such regression tests, run
regularly against the mainline, would be
quite useful as a way to reduce regressions, both for normal bugs as well
as for security holes. 
Not all kernel bugs will be amenable to
that kind of testing, but, for those that are, it seems like an idea worth
pursuing. 
</p>

<p>
The other problem that Hawkes found (<a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3081">CVE-2010-3081</a>,
also just reserved) is that the <tt>compat_alloc_user_space()</tt> function did
not check to see that the pointer which is being returned is actually a
valid user-space pointer.  That routine is used to allocate some stack
space for 
massaging 32-bit data into its 64-bit equivalent before making a system
call.  Hawkes found two places (and believes there are others) where the
lack of an <tt>access_ok()</tt> 
call in that path could be exploited to allow attackers to write to kernel
memory. 
</p>

<p>
One of those was in a video4linux <tt>ioctl()</tt>, but the more easily
exploited spot was in the IP multicast <tt>getsockopt()</tt> call.  It uses
a 32-bit unsigned length parameter provided by user space that can be used
to confuse <tt>compat_alloc_user_space()</tt> into returning a pointer into
kernel memory.  The <tt>compat_mc_getsockopt()</tt> call then writes
user-supplied values using those pointers.  That can be fairly easily
turned into an exploit as Hawkes noted:
<div class="BigQuote">
This path allows an attacker to write a chosen value to anywhere within the
top 31 bits of the kernel address space. In practice, this seems to be more
than enough for exploitation. My proof of concept overwrote the interrupt
descriptor table, but it's likely there are other good options too.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Anvin <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=c41d68a513c71e35a14f66d71782d27a79a81ea6">patched</a>
<tt>compat_alloc_user_space()</tt> so that it always does the
<tt>access_ok()</tt> check.  That should take care of the two problem spots
that Hawkes found as well as any others that are lurking out there.  But
there have been a whole lot of kernels released with one or both of these
bugs, and there have been other bugs associated with 64-bit/32-bit
compatibility.  It is a part of the kernel that Hawkes calls "<q>a
<i>little bit</i> scary</q>":
<div class="BigQuote">
Not just because it's an increased attack surface versus having purely
32-bit or purely 64-bit modes, but because of the type of input processing
that has to be performed by any such compatibility layer. It invariably
involves a significant amount of subtle bit wrangling between 32/64-bit
values, using primitives that I'd argue most programmers aren't normally
exposed to. The possibility of misuse and abuse is very real.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps 32-bit compatibility for x86_64 kernels would be a good starting
point for regression testing.  Some enterprise distributions were not
affected by CVE-2010-3301 because of the ancient kernels (like RHEL's
2.6.18) they are based on, but CVE-2010-3081 was <a
href="https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-40265">backported into RHEL 5</a>,
which required that kernel to be updated.  The interests of
distribution vendors would be well-served by
better&mdash;any&mdash;regression testing so a project of that sort would
be quite welcome.  The vendors may already be running some tests
internally, but 
regression testing is just the kind of project that would benefit from some
cross-distribution collaboration.
</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that a <a
href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Sep/268">posting</a> to the
full-disclosure mailing list claims that the vulnerability in
<tt>compat_mc_getsockopt()</tt> has been known for nearly two-and-a-half
years by black (or at least gray) hats.  According to the post, it was
noticed when the vulnerability was <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=dae50295488f35d2d617b08a5fae43154c947eec">introduced</a> in April 2008.  Certainly
there are some that are following the commit-stream to try to find these
kinds of vulnerabilities; it would be good if the kernel had a team of
white hats doing the same.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This may be a silly question (especially at this stage), but how hard would it be to do more of the 32bit/64bit compatibility in user space?  Like say, would a special C library for mixed systems work?  I realise of course that anyone doing their own system calls would probably also need some fixing, but people who do that sort of thing should be capable of handling it.<br>

In order to run 32-bit code, the userspace process has to run in 32-bit compatibility mode at the hardware level -- this is a setting on x86_64 processors to temporarily emulate 32-bit processors. So the kernel needs at least that much support, since I believe entering and exiting compatibility mode is a privileged operation.<br>
<p>
You could potentially imagine doing the syscall 32/64 marshalling in user space, but you have the problem that unless you do something really clever and/or scary, that marshalling has to run in 32-bit mode because of the above fact, even though it's trying to talk to 64-bit kernel interfaces. Since the 64-bit kernel interfaces rely on using e.g. the full 64-bit registers, this is probably impossible.<br>
<p>
You could perhaps have some new interface that accepts 64-bit data, but in a form accessible to this 32-bit shim layer, but there would almost certainly be a performance cost associated.<br>
<p>
There are other problems, too, such as this shim having to know about virtually every ioctl in the kernel, something that would be nigh-impossible to keep up to date.<br>

Switching modes is not a privileged operation; all it takes is a far jump (setting up the segment for the jump _is_ a privileged operation).<br>
<p>
AFAIK the Windows kernel does not support 32-bit entries at all; the compatibility code is completely in userspace.<br>

Interesting. So the kernel could conceivably set up a segment so that libc could jump into a 64-bit compat shim before making syscalls.<br>
<p>
The problem of libc having to know about all these random ioctl calls so that it can marshal their parameters between 32-bit and 64-bit mode still exists, though, and I don't see a good solution there.<br>

Right, but the kernel has to know the layout and structure of all of these structs, anyways, since it has to extract the data to use it. So it's only a little more work, comparatively, to also have 32-bit parse code.<br>
<p>
Whereas currently, libc doesn't have to know anything about ioctl formats, it just passes a pointer along. And so if you compile a new kernel module that has some random new ioctl()s, and install the corresponding user programs, everything works. But if libc has to do the marshaling, I also need to update my libc, which is much harder.<br>

The trick is that the kernel provides the compatibility library, not libc.<br>

These days it seems to me that everything I run is 64-bit.  My two proprietary software concessions (video driver, and flash) are 64-bit.  Would it be feasible for popular distros to offer 64-bit pure systems, and configure out this compat layer from the kernel?  I'd imagine that, build-wise, it would be pretty much equivalent to the normal 64+32 distro, except with a different kernel image and the package manager just wouldn't install the 32-bit binaries.<br>

I was considering the same thing. Is it possible to disable the 32bit compatibility mode by booting with some kernel boot parameter (or manipulating /proc after boot) ?<br>

      <p>This has been brought up before.  See the first part of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/405955/">http://lwn.net/Articles/405955/</a>, which instructs the kernel to execute everything looking like a 32-bit ELF using <tt>/bin/echo</tt> (which obviously doesn't execute much).

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; This path allows an attacker to write a chosen value to anywhere within the top 31 bits of the kernel address space.</font><br>

So, is that the top four bytes of the kernel address space, or every 8-billionth byte throughout the address space?<br>

What is meant is the top ~2 billion (2^31) addresses. That is to say, any address accessible via a 31-bit offset from the top of the kernel address space.<br>
<p>
The expression "top 31 bits of kernel address space" is a bit jargony, but I suspect most kernel developers would get what it means without thinking too hard.<br>

      The expression "N bits of address space" is used in the kernel tree itself in places like <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.35/Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt">Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt</a>.  It's well understood to mean "a region of address space 2^N bytes wide", but is more concise.

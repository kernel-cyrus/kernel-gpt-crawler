Normally, a kernel which doesn't crash is considered to be a good thing.
It can be a source of true frustration, though, for those who want to see
the system go down in flames.  The reliability of the system means that
somebody waiting for a crash may grow old indeed in the process.
<p>
Simon Kagstrom has heard the pain expressed by such users; in response, he
has posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/371208/">a kernel module</a>
just for people who want to be able to destroy their systems on demand.
This module creates a directory (<tt>provoke_crash</tt>) in debugfs, filled
with a number of useful files.  For those with simple needs, a write to
<tt>bugon</tt> results in a straightforward <tt>BUG()</tt> call.  Users with more
discriminating tastes can write to <tt>null_dereference</tt> to cause a null
pointer dereference, <tt>overwrite_allocation</tt> to write beyond a heap
allocation, or <tt>corrupt_stack</tt> to overwrite the stack.  And truly
kinky users can go for <tt>oops_interrupt_context</tt> to get a null
dereference in softirq mode, <tt>write_after_free</tt> to step on freed
memory, or <tt>unaligned_load_store</tt> to perform badly-aligned memory
operations.
<p>
Needless to say, this isn't a module one would ordinarily want to leave
loaded into a production system; it's better kept in a secret place and
pulled out after the kids go to sleep.  Unless, of course, you have a real
use for it; Simon has been employing it to make sure that <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366987/"><tt>kmsg_dump()</tt></a> does the
right thing in various crash scenarios.  For most developers, though, work
is normally dominated by the need to <i>avoid</i> crashes; since they'll
have little use for this feature, it's not clear that this little module
will ever make its way into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Why not?  Windows 2000 and XP have <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?p=227">a similar feature</a> (invoked by a keystroke combination).</p>

<p>Of course, I'd personally be afraid of this module lurking in my kernel.  One malicious script writing to any of the files in the provoke_crash directory with this module active would be disastrous.</p>

      I did add some helpful Kconfig messages for that: <i>NOTE: This feature is 
dangerous! [...] If unsure, say N.</i> :-).
<P>
There was some opposition against it (NULL dereferences can be done through 
<tt>/proc/sysrq-trigger</TT> already) so it looks like it won't get merged. 
Anyway, the patch is out now, so if someone else needs something similar it 
should be easy to find.

What a coincidence, I just today added a hack in the form of a file in /proc/sys/kernel/ to cause an instant panic() if a non-zero value is written there.  We need that to test that the hardware watchdog circuit in our platform does the right thing.  I guess the need for this "functionality" may be wider than it seems :-)<br>

Personally this would have been great when I was dealing with failover preparation before moving things to the datacenter.    Being able to on demand crash certain VM's (no, not kill them, stop them or so, but really crash them) would have been great, since it's an alltogether different failure mode, and may need special care.<br>
<p>
Yes, I really do hope this goes into mainline, It might have to be installed separately in a distribution ofc. but it's still good to have proper debug tools.<br>

A good module to test stability. I'd like to have that in mainline, in order to test, for example:<br>
1) HA (high availability) systems and failover<br>
2) database hot-standby systems and failover<br>
3) VMs (virtual machines)<br>
4) the host of VMs (does it trash the VMs filesystems?)<br>
5) filesystems in general<br>
<p>
of course that module should be replaced on production systems, but it would be really great for stability testing. Why *not* include it? It doesn't change any other kernel code, and is easy to maintain.<br>

      Maybe now is the time for the Linux kernel to adopt a "crash-only" shutdown policy [1]. If your application or the kernel always shuts down gracefully, then you are not really testing your recovery code (and you are wasting time cleaning up resources). Always crashing on shutdown will force developers to consider error-handling and recovery from (inevitable!) crashes.

I couldn't agree more. I yearn for the days when the OS was always in a state where it could be powered down. Are you done using your computer? Just turn the power switch off. Now we have to "shutdown" which is a pain and takes time. I'd prefer the system was always in a state ready to be turned off safely, even it if took longer to operate.<br>

      Interesting...the only machine I've <i>ever</i> used that could just be turned off was a Data General Nova with core memory; turn it on, and it just picked up where it left off.  Every other system I've ever used was unhappy with an abrupt turn-off.

.. or when you were writing to your hard drive.<br>
<p>
you can do this today with linux, just mount all your filesystems syncronously and you will have a system that you can shutdown at any time that it's not writing to your disk.<br>
<p>
you will also have a system that you will find unusably slow, you don't realize how much you gain from not waiting for writes to hit disk before continuing.<br>

Actually it's quite viable to use synchronous writes on filesystems - that's how I set up all my Linux systems, having had some major hassles with data corruption on ext3.  There is some performance hit but it's still a lot faster than my Windows XP laptop which has about the same CPU and RAM.<br>
<p>
See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/350072/">http://lwn.net/Articles/350072/</a> for the details - however, I now think that the only problem is not having synchronous writes, and that LVM is largely OK.  This makes sense given that LVM is used a lot in enterprise Linux servers.<br>

AFAIR you had to park the harddrive on most systems with such a device back in the day, so that wasn't universal. The Commodore 64 OTOH, was an instant off computer. ;)<br>

      Only if you weren't saving something to the tape!
<p>
Anyway, you can use <tt>halt -f</tt> to achieve the same thing you a Linux 
computer. You can probably also bind it to the ACPI event when the power 
button is pressed to get the desired behavior. The less brave among us would 
do a <tt>sync</tt> first :-)

My Amiga would allow you to to turn it off when you were done. No shutdown needed. This was a very unix-ish, fast, multitasking OS.<br>

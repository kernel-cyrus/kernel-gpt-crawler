One of the goals of memory compaction, Vlastimil Babka said at the
beginning of his memory-management track session at the 2017 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, is to make higher-order pages
available.  These pages — suitably aligned groups of physically contiguous
pages — have many uses, including supporting the transparent huge pages
feature.  Compaction is mostly done on demand in the kernel now; he would
like to do more of it ahead of time instead.
<p>
The scheme he has in mind involves doing compaction in the background,
outside of the context of any specific process.  The <tt>kswapd</tt> thread
would be woken from the memory-allocation slow path, and would be expected
to reclaim a certain number of single pages.  It would then wake the
separate <tt>kcompactd</tt> thread with a desired size for the higher-order
pages.  This thread would do compaction until a page of the desired order
is available, or until the entire memory zone has been scanned.  That may
not be enough, though, since, at the end, it will have created only a
single higher-order page.
<p>
He asked the crowd for ideas on how to make this scheme better.  Michal
Hocko suggested adding a configuration option; the administrator could set
a watermark and a time period.  The compaction thread would then check each
period and try to ensure that the desired number of pages are available.
But Babka objected that this behavior doesn't really seem like something

<a href="/Articles/717660/"><img

that administrators can be expected to configure properly.  They are
focused on parameters like transparent huge page allocation rates or
network throughput and will be hard put to translate that to desired
numbers of free pages.  It would be better, he said, to have the system
tune itself if possible.
<p>
What would be the inputs to an auto-tuning solution?  The first would be
recent demand for pages of each order.  Even better would be future demand,
of course, but, in its absence, the best that can be done is to assume that
future behavior will not differ too much from the recent past.  It might
also be desirable to track the importance of each request; transparent huge
pages are an opportunistic optimization, while higher-order pages for the
SLUB allocator can be hard to do without.  The other useful input would be
the success rate of recent compaction attempts; if compaction isn't
working, there is no point in continuing to try it.  Mel Gorman suggested
also tracking the number of compaction requests that come in while the
compaction itself is running.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli pointed out that it will be necessary to protect large pages
created by compaction from normal allocation requests.  Otherwise, the
kernel might work to 
put together a higher-order page, only to have it immediately broken up
again in response to a single-page allocation.  When compaction is done
directly from an allocation request this problem does not arise, since the
resulting large page would be used right away.  The proactive approach is
promising, he said, but the protection problem needs to be addressed for it
to work.
<p>
The proactive compaction feature is a work in progress, Babka said; 
<a href="/Articles/717756/">an RFC 
patch</a> was sent out recently.  It tries to track the
number of allocations 
that would have succeeded with more <tt>kcompactd</tt> activity.
Essentially, those are situations where there are enough free pages in the
system, but they are too fragmented to use.  The patches are not currently
tracking the importance of allocation requests; perhaps the GFP flags could
be used for that purpose.  There is also no long-term averaging of demand.
For now, it simply runs until there are enough high-order pages available.
<p>
One remaining problem is evaluating the value of this work.  The existing
artificial benchmarks, he said, are reaching their limits in this area.
<p>
Concerns were raised that background compaction might increase a system's
power usage.  Hocko said that this kind of worry was why he had suggested
a configuration knob for this feature.  Babka replied that power
consumption should not be a big problem; compaction responds to actual
demand on the system, so it should not be active when the system is
otherwise mostly idle.
<p>
As the session came to a close, Arcangeli suggested that perhaps subsystems
with large-page needs could register with the compaction code and indicate
how many pages they would like to have available.  Babka said that he would
like to go as far as he can without the addition of any sort of tuning
knobs, though.  Johannes Weiner said there would be value in an on/off
switch, since any sort of proactive work risks wasting resources in some
environments.  Any more tuning than that should be avoided, though, he
said.  It was generally agreed that this feature looked valuable, but that
it should start as simple as possible with the idea that more complexity
could be added later if needed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Today's graphical applications require frame-perfect displays, while also
taking advantage of specialized, power-saving hardware in embedded GPUs.
To do that, the kernel must be able to update the hardware graphics state
atomically — changing multiple independent parameters in a single
	operation so that users don't see corrupted frames while the
	change is taking place.
The <a href="/Articles/653071/">first article</a> of this series looked at why
an atomic display update API has
become necessary, how it came to be, and what the main driver interfaces look like.
Here, we will look into a few more details and build on the
material discussed earlier.</p>

<p>
Still, a short recap of the main
interface can't hurt: an atomic display update is created by duplicating the
state structures for display objects like planes or a CRTC and then updating
the duplicates, which are collected in
<tt>struct&nbsp;drm_atomic_state</tt>. Once all 
updates are applied, the new state is provided in its entirety to the driver's
<tt>-&gt;atomic_check()</tt> function for validation. If it passes, then it can
be committed using <tt>-&gt;atomic_commit()</tt>. Just validating updates to
figure out in a generic way what's possible is also supported using a check-only
mode.

<h4>Of atomic updates and nuclear options</h4>

<p>
A big change in upstream atomic mode setting compared to the Android
Display Framework (ADF) is that upstream allows any display state to
be changed through the atomic <tt>ioctl()</tt>. ADF only allows plane
states to be changed atomically; output routing and display-mode
changes (which are called mode-set changes in this article)
need separate calls from user space in ADF. At least on a cursory look,
plane updates and mode-set changes are indeed two different things.  On
one hand, atomic plane updates are meant to be completed by the
next frame displayed. Atomic mode-set updates, on the other hand, can
cause a display to go to black for a bit, which is anything but
perfect. Mode-set updates generally take hundreds of milliseconds. But both
update the display state in an atomic, all-or-nothing fashion and they
can both use the same "list of property changes" transport for the
<tt>ioctl()</tt>. So, purely by just looking at the structures and data
passed between user space and the kernel — and not the requested
semantics — it makes a lot of sense to treat them as the same
operation.

<p>
The tension between these two types of updates
resulted in a lot of confusion when discussing atomic plans for upstream.
It was only fixed by calling full mode sets "atomic mode sets"
and calling the  
plane updates "nuclear 
page flips".
But when you look closer, the distinction between full mode sets and pure plane
updates synchronized to the next frame becomes unclear quickly. Often a
display mode change 
on integrated panels only means that the scaler used to fit the displayed
area onto the panel
needs to be 
adjusted. A lot of hardware can do that with a small update for the next
frame,  without the need for a full mode set and
blanking the screen. But then 
there's hardware where some plane configuration changes require reallocation of
FIFO space, and that is only possible when the display pipeline is shut down.
Which looks very much like a mode set.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, user space would often like to delay changes that require full
mode sets to a more suitable time. For example, tablets and smartphones
suspend so 
often that pretty much any mode set can be delayed without incurring too much
energy waste by running in a suboptimal configuration until the next
suspend. There, 
plane changes that need a full mode set shouldn't be done without the
consent of user space to avoid a less-than-perfect visual experience for
users.</p> 

<p>
After many bits were expended discussing this problem, the solution merged
was the 
<tt>DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET</tt> flag. With this, user space can
indicate whether a full mode set (with the downsides of potentially blanking 
seemingly unrelated screens and taking a long time) is acceptable or not. And, of
course, this flag is also obeyed for the test-only mode. Most drivers don't need
to bother with this, since the atomic helpers take care of checking for it — as
long as the driver correctly indicates to the helper code that it needs or
doesn't need a full mode set in one of the special cases mentioned above.

<h4>Locking magic using wait/wound mutexes</h4>

<p>
Next up is how concurrent updates are handled. A while ago, <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=29494c174dc4793ebd236aa522a2a1ed73b7180e">DRM
 gained per-CRTC locks</a> to allow concurrent updates and changes on different
 display pipelines. That, in turn, required <a
 href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4d02e2de0e80a786452e70d7f3a20a50641e6620">per-plane
 locks</a> since planes can (if the hardware supports it) change the CRTC
 they're connected to. In addition, there's one more lock to protect all the
 output routing and connector state — making those kinds of changes usually
 requires at least a few 
 hundred milliseconds, thus will result in stalls no matter what.
 It's also a rare and usually system-wide operation, so finer-grained
 locking for that would just be wasted.</p>

<p>
But one problem with the atomic <tt>ioctl()</tt> is that user
space could pass its 
list of updates (in the form of <tt>object_id</tt>, <tt>property_id</tt>,
<tt>value</tt> triples) in any order it wants.
That could easily lead to deadlocks
if they are processed in that order, since different objects require
different locks.  User space could provoke an AB-BA deadlock by creating
two updates that list the same two objects but in a different order.

<p>
That can be solved by sorting the entire list of triples by objects first, but
unfortunately that only delays the problem.
The first article explained that atomic state-checking code is only allowed
to look at or touch the state of objects that are in the update. This
guarantees 
that concurrent updates won't trample each another. Unfortunately, that also
means that drivers must be able to add arbitrary objects and their states
to the overall atomic update tracked in the <tt>drm_atomic_state</tt>
structure in their
<tt>-&gt;atomic_check()</tt> callback.  That will allow the callback to
check cross-object limits 
and make sure that shared resources are not exhausted. Because hardware
is crazy,
this can't be done outside of the driver code since every piece of hardware
has its 
own unique shared state. Just grabbing all potentially needed locks up front
isn't a great idea either, since that will only make all updates synchronous and
hence make all the fine-grained locking pointless.</p>

<p>
This means a locking scheme where locks can be taken in an arbitrary order
is needed. 
Luckily, the kernel has that with its <a
 href="/Articles/548909/">wait/wound mutex</a> support, which,
 incidentally, was also added by GPU driver hackers for some pesky
 memory-management troubles. Wait/wound mutexes are a topic of their own,
 really, 
 but the 
 summary is that they allow you to grab locks in arbitrary order, can reliably
 detect deadlocks, and have a means to back off from a deadlock without
 throwing 
 fairness out the window or requiring costly spinning. They're also rather
 complex.</p>

<p>
No one wants to inflict advanced locking schemes on driver writers
unnecessarily, so the locking is all nicely encapsulated in functions
provided by 
the atomic core. When you need to change which CRTC a plane is assigned to, just
call <tt>drm_atomic_set_crtc_for_plane()</tt> and make sure any errors are
forwarded correctly up the call chain. Similarly, if a driver needs to consult
other state objects in its state-validation code (e.g. to check limits on
shared resources), it can duplicate any state into the atomic update it needs
and locks will be acquired correctly behind the scenes. The only important
bit is 
to correctly forward the <tt>-EDEADLK</tt> error code and always use the
provided functions to duplicate and update state structures. With that, magic
simply happens. Well, as long as a driver's atomic check code is otherwise
correct 
and doesn't touch hardware state nor anything else that might persist outside of
just the state structures.</p>

<p>
For users of the DRM-internal atomic interface things are a notch more
complex, but 
not a lot. Wait/wound locking state is tracked in a <tt>struct
drm_modeset_acquire_ctx</tt>, which is initialized using
<tt>drm_modeset_acquire_init()</tt>. To make all the transparent lock-taking
work when duplicating state objects into an atomic update, this is also
stored in 
<tt>drm_atomic_state-&gt;ctx</tt>. As with drivers, any locks needed will be
implicitly acquired when duplicating state objects; the only thing needed is to
actually handle deadlocks signaled with the <tt>-EDEADLK</tt> error code.

<p>
Since
the deadlock backoff logic will drop locks, already duplicated state objects
might become stale and need to be released first with
<tt>drm_atomic_state_clear()</tt>. Then a call to <tt>drm_modeset_backoff()</tt>
will drop any acquired mode-set locks and block on the contended lock until it's
available. After that, the entire sequence needs to be restarted right after the
 initialization of the acquire context — that must not be reinitialized since it
contains the queue ticket that ensures
forward progress in the wait/wound locking algorithm. Finally, when everything
has succeeded, locks can be dropped with <tt>drm_modeset_drop_locks()</tt>
and the 
acquire context is finalized with <tt>drm_modeset_acquire_fini()</tt>.</p>

<p>
Note that it's really easy to test all that special backoff code: enabling
lock debugging and <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH</tt> will cause the
wait/wound mutex code to inject spurious deadlock conditions. With that, all
the deadlock backoff code can be exhaustively tested just with single-threaded
test cases.
And of course wait/wound mutexes fully support all the Linux lock debugging
and testing tools such as lockdep.

<h4>Helper-library design</h4>

<p>
The other piece that took years to settle is the driver helper-library design. A
<a href="/Articles/336262/">mid-layer approach</a>, as in ADF, was out of
question because hardware has too many special cases to be able to create
such a framework that is not too complex. There was
already an extensive set of helpers used by most drivers anyway, so preferably
drivers shouldn't have to rewrite all their callbacks and support code when
converting to atomic updates. Directly reusing the existing callbacks was
done for 
proof-of-concept conversions, but fundamentally there were a few troubles with
the existing helpers and their driver callbacks:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li>They had no real support for checking cross-object constraints. Properly
	checking those is a major goal of the atomic changes. Checking for
	such arbitrary cross-device constraints is 
	exposed to user space with
	the <tt>DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY</tt> flag, which is described in
	the first article.</li>

<li>There was no support for doing atomic updates of planes. For sane hardware
	that has lockout bits to prevent any updates until they have all been
	written to registers, this is easy to fix with just pre- and post-commit
hooks. But in general, hardware needs more flexibility there. There were also no
provisions for separating the checks from the commit phase of plane
updates.</li>

<li>Any output routing changes required updating and enabling the primary plane
	too. Often that's not what you want, for example displaying a video
	overlay 
	with black background for the letterbox or pillarbox bars doesn't
	need any 
primary plane at all.
The hardware can do this, so it should be made possible.
</li>

<li>Finally, the legacy helpers were designed for the very first XRandR
	implementation. In the almost ten years that have passed
	since, DRM developers learned an awful lot of lessons about what
works, what should be simplified (by providing stricter guarantees in helpers),
and where more flexibility was needed to make the helpers more useful.</li>

</ul>

<p>
All in all, a full rewrite of the helper code was in order, while still making
conversions fairly easy. The big change, certainly, is that the helper library
doesn't just expose one monolithic template function for each hook, but also
exposes separate pieces, for example to handle plane-only updates or only
 output 
configuration changes. Aside from a few restrictions imposed by the atomic
semantics 
they can also be called in arbitrary order, as it best suits the hardware. This
way drivers can mix and match between helper code and their own — or just
augment 
helper code as needed (for checking or changing global state for example).

<p>
A
good example would be drivers supporting runtime power management (PM).
The old 
legacy helpers 
updated planes in between disabling outputs and enabling them with the new
configuration. For best backward compatibility, that's also what the atomic
helpers do, but this is not the best for drivers supporting runtime PM. Such
drivers will
disable the hardware when the display pipelines are off and, hence, plane updates
will get lost if they are done in the middle. It's better to do plane
updates as the 
final step of committing the update to hardware, and the helpers allow this.</p>

<p>
Another useful feature of the new helper library is that any derived state to
steer control flow is stored in the state structures — it has to be, due to the
check/commit split. That allows drivers to overwrite and control the helpers in
fine detail. For example, a driver can force a full mode set (and the
required state precomputation) when some shared global resources need to be
adjusted, even when
the helper wouldn't see a need for a full mode set on its own. Since the
exported check functions are idempotent, they can be re-run when a later step
uncovers the need (again due to shared resources) to include more objects in the
atomic update.

<p>
That is useful when a plane update uncovers the need for a full
mode set. But a full mode set, in turn, might require recomputations for plane
states, creating a loop. Making the exported helpers idempotent and callable in
any order helps to break such loops. To avoid surprises, the default check
function, 
<tt>drm_atomic_helper_check()</tt>,
only calls the subordinate helpers to
 check plane updates and mode-set changes once each.
But
hardware with complicated dependencies between these two types of updates
(like the example earlier where a plane update can require a full
mode set, maybe even on an unrelated CRTC) can be handled by calling
the helpers multiple times, until a steady state has been reached for the
precomputed state. Note that this is only to facilitate the state
validation, the actual commit of the atomic update to the hardware
should still happen in one go, without any iterating.

<p>
Also, all the functions to implement legacy callbacks in terms of the atomic
driver interfaces are exported and can be called explicitly.
Drivers without a need to specially handle legacy entry points can just put
the provided helpers directly into the DRM driver operation function tables.
 This allows drivers to keep some features only
supported for legacy interfaces by keeping the code for old platforms around.
This is useful for drivers which support ten or more years of hardware
iterations where 
it doesn't make sense to implement proper atomic support for every old special
case.</p>

<p>
The other big change is simpler semantics for drivers. Thanks to the atomic
updates, the new helpers can keep track of state changes much better and
guarantee that a disable or enable hook won't be called redundantly — which the
old helpers routinely did. They also hide a lot of the potential flexibility of
legacy interfaces like the four different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_Display_Power_Management_Signaling">display
power management signaling</a> (DPMS) levels used for runtime PM on
outputs — the atomic helpers only have on and off.
This is because modern
hardware simply doesn't support intermediate DPMS levels any more.
On anything but the oldest of hardware, drivers just
clamped the intermediate levels to off. This also allows the atomic
helpers to reuse the same enable and disable hooks for runtime PM
as for the normal enabling and disabling of outputs, which simplifies
drivers.
The <tt>-&gt;dpms()</tt> callbacks are still supported to
simplify converting drivers from legacy mode setting to atomic, but they are
deprecated. Converted drivers should only have to implement the
<tt>-&gt;enable()</tt> and <tt>-&gt;disable()</tt> hooks and should be able
to delete the DPMS handlers entirely.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are transitional helpers to handle the impedance mismatch for
planes between legacy helpers and the new atomic ones. They provide helpers like
<tt>drm_helper_crtc_mode_set_base()</tt> that implement the legacy helper
callbacks in terms of the new atomic helper callbacks. This allows driver writers
to switch over to the new hooks for plane updates in their backend while
otherwise still using the same code and overall control-flow. That helps a lot
in converting big drivers by allowing the conversion to happen in multiple
phases that only deal with a part of the driver. There's also a "<a
 href="http://blog.ffwll.ch/2014/11/atomic-modeset-support-for-kms-drivers.html">how to</a>"
 that has all of the details for an atomic conversion — what all
 needs to be 
 done and in which exact order.</p>

<p>
Overall, there are a number of drivers already converted and the new
helpers seem to be working out
well. Some small changes in the interfaces of callbacks were needed,
but thus far there have been no big problems with the semantics
themselves. A big reason for that 
is that the new code has been modeled after the <tt>i915.ko</tt>-specific mode-set
infrastructure, which has been developed over the past few years with an aim
toward atomic updates.

<p>
The big lesson learned from
<tt>i915.ko</tt> led to the major difference 
in the merged code: how an atomic update is assembled before actually
committing it to the hardware.
In <tt>i915.ko</tt> all updates were staged
using a set of <tt>new_foo</tt> members embedded into each mode-setting
object structure, mirroring all the existing data structures and
pointers. The major downside of that approach is that rolling back an
update (either because it violates a constraint or because user space
only asked to check constraints using <tt>TEST_ONLY</tt>) needed to carefully
undo all these changes. Staging updates in the objects themselves also
makes it much harder to have multiple updates in-flight at the same
time. With the merged atomic infrastructure, updates are assembled out
of free-standing state objects and no permanent mode-setting object
structures are touched before actually committing state to the
hardware. That makes rollback and handling concurrent updates much
easier.

<p>
The unresolved gap in the current helpers is handling non-blocking
updates. Thus far, 
drivers need to manage their own work queues for the asynchronous tail of an atomic
update and synchronize appropriately when an update depends upon global state,
like they had to already for primary plane page flips with the old legacy <tt>ioctl()</tt>.
There are ideas floating around to implement this in the atomic helpers. But nothing has come up that is both simple enough to be an improvement over
the current state while still being useful for a lot of drivers.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>
After more than three years in the making, upstream has finally a mode-setting
interface and support infrastructure for drivers that covers all of the use
cases, from 
energy-sipping systems-on-chip (SoCs) with the need for all the special plane
hardware and supporting perfect 
updates of each frame to big desktops supporting multiple screens. That's a
first, 
since the original kernel mode setting pretty much left embedded systems to
fbdev. But given the number of ongoing or already-merged conversions to atomic
and entirely new drivers supporting it, it looks like upstream graphics for
SoCs is finally happening and is bound to stay. Well, at least for the
mode-setting 
side of GPUs.  But even just that would be a big change and a great
improvement for all the upstreaming efforts of Android-vendor kernel trees.</p>

<p>Let's all embrace the age of atomic mode setting — that future is here
and it is looking

The locking sounds complicated, even when mostly hidden in the helper libraries.<br>

What use-cases require fine-grained locking for plane or mode changes, ie why isn't it reasonable to just create a single big lock around the whole set of operations that modify such config? Changing screen resolution or redirecting a plane to a different CRTC is a fairly low-frequency operation; which operations happen so often that it requires such locking? Thanks..<br>

We used to do that..   remember when framerate dropped every 10sec when hotplug poll loop tried to see if the monitor was still there?<br>
<p>
Granted, we managed to fix that without going *as* fine-grained as we are now.  But think about a use-case like plugging in a 2nd display while watching video / playing game / etc on the first.  If we weren't as fine grained as we are now, you'd see your framerate stop on the first display while modeset happens on the second display.  Maybe fine for x11 (which is single threaded across all outputs, and generally sucks in many ways for multi-monitor).  Completely not-ok for a weston compositor, or android hwc, etc.<br>

no, but that it has a single main loop for all displays, rather than one per display, is..<br>
<p>
I suppose you could work around it w/ async modeset (although that seems to open up a different can of worms).. either way, orthogonal to the original question about why fine grained locking is needed.<br>

Ah - so the locking discussed in the article is not to arbitrate between multiple threads changing modes concurrently, but between a single thread changing mode and other threads performing simple "page flips" (ie changing the address of the framebuffer that backs a plane)?<br>
<p>
Performing a "simple page flip" presumably just means taking one lock on one plane...<br>

It takes a lock on the plane and on the crtc. If a plane is moved between crtc's the old and new crtc are both locked.<br>

Daniel,<br>
<p>
thanks for this great article series. Not only it summarizes the history and provenance of KMS, I also enjoyed reading a good piece of text (well, I'm actually used to greatly written articles at LWN, but I also found your blogs very well written).<br>
<p>
While recent developments on SoCs fueled the improvements in the Linux graphics area, I think there is still some way to go with proprietary NVIDIA and AMD drivers (IMO). AFAIK, KMS is still not supported by some drivers (however, I recognize that especially Intel has contributed to the great progress in the Open Source graphics infrastructure).<br>
<p>
What are your thoughts on future developments in this area ?<br>

[somehow missed comments here, sorry for the late reply.]<br>
<p>
The more important part imo are SoC drivers, and there's a lot going on there. For the big desktop graphics drivers AMD has already decided to completely move to the upstream kernel driver even for their proprietary stack, so that will take care of itself. Nvidia is a big hold-out and has not plans to either adapt KMS in their blob driver, nor switch over to the upstream one for desktop graphics. Their approach to supporting Wayland is to create an entire new pile of EGL extension to abstract away between their own kernel interfaces and upstream KMS, and that approach was resurroundingly rejected by the community as both unnecessary (no benefit over direct KMS for everyone else) and feature deficient (their proposal is firmly stuck in the pre-atomic days).<br>
<p>
So overally I'd say it's looking really good (at least within a few years), except for nvidia chips.<br>

Very nice read, Daniel, as the first article!<br>
<p>
Again I propose some small fixes.  Typo:<br>
<p>
- requires a at least a few hundred<br>
+ requires at least a few hundred<br>
<p>
I take it that "the acquire context" is the context used by the<br>
wait/wound algorithm for automatic lock acquisition.  Then please<br>
consider doing:<br>
<p>
- after the initialization of the acquire context<br>
+ after the initialization of the "acquire" context<br>
<p>
...in the first usage of the phrase.  And then:<br>
<p>
- that, ... context — that must not be reinitialized<br>
+ that, ... context — which must not be reinitialized<br>
<p>
Nitpicking, consider:<br>
<p>
- is the driver helper-library design<br>
+ is the design of the driver helper library<br>
<p>
- This allows drivers to keep some features only supported for legacy<br>
- interfaces by keeping the code for old platforms around.<br>
+ This allows drivers to continue supporting some features, though only<br>
+ for legacy interfaces, by keeping the code for old platforms around.<br>
<p>
Finally, note that in the first article the A in ADF was expanded as<br>
"Atomic" not "Android".<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 11, 2013</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, nearly 8,500 non-merge changesets have been pulled into
the mainline repository for the 3.12 development cycle; almost 5,000 of
those have been pulled since <a href="/Articles/565715/">last week's
summary</a>.  The process was <a href="/Articles/566185/">slowed
somewhat</a> when Linus's primary disk drive failed, but not even hardware
failure can stop the kernel process for long.
<p>
This development cycle continues to feature a large range of internal
improvements and relatively few exciting new features.  Some of the
user-visible changes that have been merged include: 
<p>
<ul>

<li> The direct rendering graphics layer has gained the concept of "render 
     nodes," which separate the rendering of graphics from modesetting and
     other display control; the "big three" graphics drivers all support
     this concept.  See <a
     href="https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/splitting-drm-and-kms-device-nodes/">this
     post from David Herrmann</a> for more information on where this work
     is going.
<p>
<li> The netfilter subsystem supports a new "SYNPROXY" target that
     simulates connection establishment on one side of the firewall before
     actually establishing the connection on the other.  It can be thought
     of as a way of implementing SYN cookies at the perimeter, preventing
     spurious connection attempts from traversing the firewall.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/564978/">TSO sizing patches and FQ
     scheduler</a> have been merged.  TSO sizing helps to eliminate bursty
     traffic when TCP segmentation offload is being used, while FQ provides
     a simple fair-queuing discipline for traffic transiting through the
     system. 
<p>
<li> The ext3 filesystem has a new <tt>journal_path=</tt> mount option that
     allows the specification of an external journal's location using a
     device path name.
<p>
<li> The Tile architecture has gained support for ftrace, kprobes, and full
     kernel preemption.  Also, support for the old TILE64 CPU has been
     removed. 
<p>
<li> The xfs filesystem is finally able to support user namespaces.  The
     addition of this support should make it easier for distributors to
     enable the user namespace feature, should they feel at ease with the
     security implications of such a move.
<p>
<li> Mainline support for ARM "big.LITTLE" systems is getting closer; 3.12
     will include a new cpuidle driver that builds on the <a
     href="/Articles/539082/">multi-cluster power management</a> patches to
     provide CPU idle support on big.LITTLE systems.
<p>
<li> The MD RAID5 implementation is now multithreaded, increasing its
     maximum I/O rates when dealing with fast drives.
<p>
<li> The device mapper has a new statistics module that can track I/O
     activity over a range of blocks on a DM device.  See <a
     href="/Articles/566273/">Documentation/device-mapper/statistics.txt</a>
     for details.
<p>
<li> The device tree code now feeds the entire flattened device tree text
     into the random number pool in an attempt to increase the amount of
     entropy available at early boot.  It is not clear at this point how
     much benefit is gained, since device trees are mostly or entirely
     identical for a given class of device.  It is possible for a device
     tree to hold unique data — network MAC addresses, for example — but
     that is not guaranteed, and some developers think that entropy would
     be better served by just feeding the unique data directly.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Systems and processors</b>:
     	  Freescale P1023 RDB and C293PCIE boards.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Graphics</b>: 
     	  Qualcomm MSM/Snapdragon GPUs.
	  The nouveau graphics driver has also gained proper power
     	  management support, and the power management support for Radeon
     	  devices has been improved and extended to a wider range of chips.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  GPIO-controlled backlights,
	  Sanyo LV5207LP backlight controllers,
	  Rohm BD6107 backlight controllers,
	  IdeaPad laptop slidebars,
	  Toumaz Xenif TZ1090 GPIO controllers,
	  Kontron ETX/COMexpress GPIO controllers,
	  Fintek F71882FG and F71889F GPIO controllers,
	  Dialog Semiconductor DA9063 PMICs,
	  Samsung S2MPS11 crystal oscillator clocks,
	  Hisilicon K3 DMA controllers,
	  Renesas R-Car HPB DMA controllers, and
	  TI BQ24190 and TWL4030 battery charger controllers.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Networking</b>:
     	  MOXA ART (RTL8201CP) Ethernet interfaces,
	  Solarflare SFC9100 interfaces, and
	  CoreChip-sz SR9700-based Ethernet devices.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Video4Linux</b>: 
     	  Renesas VSP1 video processing engines,
	  Renesas R-Car video input devices,
	  Mirics MSi3101 software-defined radio dongles (the first SDR
     	  device supported by the mainline kernel),
	  Syntek STK1135 USB cameras,
	  Analog Devices ADV7842 video decoders, and
	  Analog Devices ADV7511 video encoders.
     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The GEM and TTM memory managers within the graphics subsystem are now
     using a unified subsystem for the management of virtual memory areas,
     eliminating some duplicated functionality.
<p>
<li> The new <a href="/Articles/565734/">lockref</a> mechanism can now mark
     a reference-counted item as being "dead."  The separate state is
     needed because lockrefs can be used in places (like the dentry cache)
     where an item can have a reference count of zero and still be alive
     and usable.  Once the structure has been marked as dead, though, the
     reference count cannot be incremented and the structure cannot be used.

</ul>
<p>

The closing of the merge window still looks to happen on September 15, or,
perhaps, one day later to allow Linus to get back up to speed after his
planned weekend diving experience.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
In linked post there is said that render-nodes are not bound to a specific card and that driver-unspecific user-space (which can be relatively unprivileged) should not and can not ask "how do I find the render-node for a given card?”.<br>
<p>
But I wonder, as there are hardware where there are graphics cards with different capabilities (e.g. Tesla for GPGPU, GeForce for display), would you be able to ask for said capabilities to select render node?<br>

      <p>I think that this comment from the blog post answers that question:
<blockquote>With custom heuristics. There is currently no notion of “speed” in the DRM API, but afair Ian was implementing an OpenGL extension to give some useful information to the user. So you could just open all render-nodes, see what they provide and then use them.</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the answer is that you open up each render node, query it for its capabilities, and then use the appropriate one for your task.

Feeding the device tree is GOOD because it’s still usable to separate a class of machines from another class of machines, aids mixing with other entropy sources (is a source of more unruliness) and, to be frank and saying it with the words of the developer of RANDOM.SYS for MS-DOS: “Every bit counts.”<br>

For that matter, MirBSD feeds the link-layer addresses of network interfaces into the pool in the code that attaches them to the global list of interfaces.<br>

<p>
another place this could potentially be really useful is on a load balancer, if the load balancer can avoid establishing a connection to the real server for a short time, it can potentially gather more information about what is happening before making it's decision and connecting to the real server.<br>
<p>
for example, if you can hold off until you see the packet containing the URL (or at least the beginning of it), you can direct the traffic to different servers based on what is being requested.<br>
<p>
I haven't looked at this feature yet, so i don't know how long the system can hold off on making the connection, but this is an interesting possibility.<br>

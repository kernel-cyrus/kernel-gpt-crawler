           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 17, 2014</br>

Back in November, we <a href="/Articles/621612/">looked at a patch</a> that
would allow unprivileged processes to drop groups from their credentials.
After that patch was posted, it was quickly shown that, in some cases,
dropping groups leads to an increase in privilege; the patch in question
has not been pursued since.  But it was also shown that an unprivileged
user can already drop groups by making use of user namespaces.  It took
some time, but namespace developer Eric Biederman has put together a set of
patches that, he hopes, will close that vulnerability.
<p>
Group membership can be used to restrict privilege in a couple of ways.
Access control lists can explicitly block access to a resource on the basis
of membership in a particular group.  But it is even simpler than that: if
a file's protection bits are set for "no group access," a process belonging
to that group will be blocked, even if the file is otherwise accessible by
the world as a whole.  In either case, the ability to drop a group can
enable a process to access a resource that would have otherwise been denied
to it.
<p>
In current kernels, using <tt>setgroups()</tt> to change a process's group
membership is a privileged operation.  So unprivileged processes cannot use
it to get rid of any inconvenient group memberships.  But a process running
within a user namespace is privileged inside that namespace, so a
<tt>setgroups()</tt> call there will succeed.  It is easy to write a little
program that uses <tt>clone()</tt> to create a child in a user namespace and
has the child call <tt>setgroups()</tt> to drop membership in all
supplementary groups.  This privilege-escalation vulnerability has become
known as CVE-2014-8989.
<p>
Eric's <a href="/Articles/626692/">fix</a> for this problem starts by
disabling the use of 
<tt>setgroups()</tt> within a user namespace until a group-ID mapping has
been set up for that namespace.  That mapping is created by writing the
file <tt>gid_map</tt> in the process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory; see <a
href="/Articles/532593/">this article</a> for details on how the mapping
files work.  Other user- or group-ID-oriented system calls require the
existence of a mapping before they will succeed; <tt>setgroups()</tt> now
has that restriction as well.
<p>
The biggest part of the patch adds a new control file, called
<tt>setgroups</tt>, to the <tt>/proc</tt> directory for each process.
Writing the string "<tt>deny</tt>" to that file will disable the
<tt>setgroups()</tt> system call entirely within the namespace containing
the relevant process.  The <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability is required,
so random processes cannot disable <tt>setgroups()</tt> in the top-level
namespace; once again, a process within its own user namespace is
privileged (by default) and can make this change successfully.  Once
<tt>setgroups()</tt> has been turned off, it cannot be enabled again in that
namespace or any of its descendants.  The <tt>setgroups</tt> file can only
be written to <i>before</i> the group-ID mapping has been set.
<p>
Finally, an <i>unprivileged</i> process can only change the group-ID
mapping of a namespace if <tt>setgroups()</tt> has been disabled.  The only
thing an unprivileged process can do with the group-ID mapping is to map
its own primary group ID to the same ID in the parent namespace; an
unprivileged process is not able to remap its supplementary groups.  So,
with this set of restrictions in place, it essentially become impossible to
(1)&nbsp;play tricks with mappings to drop groups, or (2)&nbsp;call
<tt>setgroups()</tt> at all without privilege.
<p>
Note that if a privileged process creates a user namespace, it can set up
arbitrary mappings for group IDs and decline to disable
<tt>setgroups()</tt>.  That would make the dropping of groups within the
namespace possible,
but, since the process is already privileged, it could do that anyway.
<p>
The end result of all this work should be the closing of the vulnerability
caused by being able to drop groups within a user namespace.  But it
highlights one of the hazards that come with the user namespace territory:
while it seems possible to contain privilege within a user namespace, there
is always the possibility of surprises like this one hiding in the corners
of the system.  It may be some time yet before we can be truly confident
that all of those surprises have been found and that the unprivileged
creation of user namespaces is truly a safe thing to allow.
<p>
Eric has <a href="/Articles/626677/">asked Linus</a> to pull these changes
for the 3.19 development cycle; that pull happened just as this week's
Edition was going to press.  The patches have been marked for stable backporting
as well, so they should eventually become available in the stable update
series.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Precisely because I'm waiting for the fallout from the patches described in this article before doing so.  Once whatever patch is going to go in does so, I plan to send out a new version of both the setusers and unprivileged setgroups patches, the latter having some combination of compile-time and runtime enabling switches.<br>

I just saw this. It reminded me of how I read Microsoft handles dropping groups. Apparently the group remains as a kind of shadow group. It no longer works for Allow permissions but still blocks on Deny permissions.<br>

Possible to make it sane by supporting something like (in /etc/group):<br>
games:x:60:-user1,-user2<br>

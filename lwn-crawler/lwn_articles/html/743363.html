           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 9, 2018</br>
           </div>
<p>
The <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Meltdown/Spectre</a> debacle has,
deservedly, reached the mainstream press 
and, likely, most of the public that has even a remote interest in computers
and security.  It only took a day or so from the accelerated disclosure
date of January&nbsp;3—it was originally scheduled for
January&nbsp;9—before the bugs 
were making big headlines.  But Spectre has been known for at least six
months and Meltdown for nearly as long—at least to some in the industry.
Others that were affected were completely blindsided by the
announcements and have joined the scramble to mitigate these hardware bugs
before they bite users.  Whatever else can be said about Meltdown and Spectre,
the handling (or, in truth, mishandling) of this whole incident has been a
horrific failure.
</p>

<p>
For those just tuning in, Meltdown and Spectre are two types of hardware
bugs that affect most modern CPUs.  They allow attackers to cause the CPU
to do speculative execution of code, while timing memory accesses to deduce
what has or has not been cached, to disclose the contents of memory.  These
disclosures can span various security boundaries such as between user space
and the kernel or between guest operating systems running in virtual
machines.  For more information, see the <a href="/Articles/742702/">LWN
article on the flaws</a> 
and the <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-raspberry-pi-isnt-vulnerable-to-spectre-or-meltdown/">blog
post</a> by Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton that well describes modern CPU
architectures and speculative execution to explain why the Raspberry Pi is
not affected.
</p>

<p>
Given the nature of the bugs, and that cache-timing side channels have been
known for some time, it is a bit surprising that these longstanding flaws
were all found relatively recently.  In fact, it would appear that they
were all found by independent teams (three for Meltdown and two for
Spectre) at more or less the same time.  That worryingly suggests that it
is not outside the realm of possibility that black-hat attackers and/or
government spy agencies may have gotten there first—maybe by years.
There is no evidence 
of that occurring, but attacks using the flaws would not be easy to detect,
though using the information disclosed might have set off some alarm bells.
</p>

<h4>Discovery and disclosure</h4>

<p>
Jann Horn of Google's Project Zero discovered
both of the flaws as part of his research; he <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html">detailed
them in a lengthy blog post</a>.  In that post, he noted that Spectre was
disclosed to Intel, AMD, and ARM on June&nbsp;1, but that Meltdown was only
reported later.  As Jan Wildeboer's extensive <a
href="https://plus.google.com/+jwildeboer/posts/jj6a9JUaovP">timeline</a>
shows, Meltdown was found by Horn (and two academic teams) sometime before
the July&nbsp;28 publication of "<a
href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">Negative
Result: Reading Kernel Memory From User Mode</a>" by Anders Fogh, which
described the Meltdown technique.  From the just-released <a
href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1272">Project
Zero bug report</a>, which has lots of good information and
proof-of-concept code, we see that Horn refers to "variant 3" (which is
Meltdown) on 
June&nbsp;22.
</p>

<p>
After those disclosures, Intel (and perhaps the other CPU vendors) started
alerting some of its customers and other interested parties under a
non-disclosure 
agreement (NDA).  For Ubuntu, that happened on November&nbsp;9, according
to <a
href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown">its
timeline</a>.  Other Linux distributions were also alerted, though it seems
possible that some distributions and, probably, cloud providers were
notified earlier.  Apple and Microsoft may well have gotten earlier notice too;
Apple released fixes for Meltdown on several of its operating systems in
mid-December.  Since there is, as yet, no timeline from Intel or the other
CPU vendors, we are left guessing on who got notified and when.
</p>

<p>
We do know that many Linux distributions were left out in the cold, as was
the BSD community.  <a
href="https://blog.linode.com/2018/01/03/cpu-vulnerabilities-meltdown-spectre/">Smaller
cloud companies</a> and others with less clout were 
 left out as well—multiple tier-2 cloud providers have <a
 href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/06/how-tier-2-cloud-vendors-banded-together-to-cope-with-spectre-and-meltdown/">formed
 a group</a> to help cope with the fallout. As might be guessed, that has
 left some less 
than entirely impressed with the whole process.
</p>

<h4>KAISER and KPTI</h4>

<p>
The bugs were embargoed, but that started to break down as hints about the
flaws were published.  Before Fogh's post, Daniel Gruss and others at Graz
University of Technology published a <a
href="https://gruss.cc/files/kaiser.pdf">paper [PDF]</a> that described
ways to break kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR).  It also
described a mechanism to avoid those problems, called KAISER, that would
unmap kernel memory before entering user-space code.  A <a
href="/Articles/737940/">patch set</a> to implement KAISER was posted to
the linux-kernel mailing list on October&nbsp;31; it was based on the work
by Gruss and his team and forward-ported by Dave Hansen.
</p>

<p>
Those patches were undoubtedly not meant as a Halloween gift to security
researchers, but may well have served that purpose.  Normally, a patch set
that radically changed the memory layout of the running kernel at a fairly
high performance cost—ostensibly simply to avoid KASLR breaks—would find
tough sledding, but something was clearly 
different with KAISER.  After all, it has never been particularly difficult
for attackers to break KASLR and preventing that has never been a "drop
everything and fix it" kind of problem.  But KAISER was treated as an
urgent fix.
</p>

<p>
The KAISER patches fairly quickly morphed into
<a href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> (KPTI) and were
<a href="/Articles/742404/">merged</a> for the 4.15-rc6 release, which is
unprecedented in recent times; it was also picked up for the 4.14 stable
kernel series. 
Clearly, something important was afoot.
That led to lots of discussion about what the real bug is, here and
elsewhere.  A <a 
href="/Articles/743743/">patch</a> from Tom Lendacky to turn off KPTI for
AMD processors led to speculation 
about speculation (that is, speculative execution).
KPTI addressed the Meltdown vulnerability, but Spectre was
"unknown" outside of certain rarefied circles until the dam broke on
January&nbsp;3. 
</p>

<p>
When that happened, it could plainly be seen that the <a href="/Articles/743265/">state of the
mitigations for Spectre</a> was far behind KPTI.  There were multiple
patches by authors at different companies, some that didn't apply to any
known kernel tree, some that didn't compile, and so on.  It was clearly the
result of the embargo; instead of working together, various
organizations were working on their own.  The Spectre flaws are definitely
harder to mitigate, but not coordinating the thinking and fixes certainly
has not helped matters.  So far, no fixes for Spectre have made it into the
mainline.  One would guess that will change shortly after the release of
4.15, which should come in mid-late January.
</p>

<h4>Grumbling</h4>

<p>
There has been a fair amount of grumbling about how this process has played
out.  Without pointing fingers, Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="http://kroah.com/log/blog/2018/01/06/meltdown-status/">stated his
opinion</a> in a status update on the bug fixes:
<div class="BigQuote">
As for how this was all handled by the companies involved, well this could
be described as a textbook example of how <i>NOT</i> to interact with the Linux
kernel community properly. The people and companies involved know what
happened, and I'm sure it will all come out eventually, but right now we
need to focus on fixing the issues involved, and not pointing blame, no
matter how much we want to.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But it is clear that at least parts of the Linux kernel community were
aware of Meltdown, at least, as far back as the original posting of the
KAISER patches.  Other open-source operating systems got no warning at all,
other than perhaps some background rumbling because of KAISER/KPTI.  As
OpenBSD developer  Philip Guenther <a href="/Articles/743676/">put it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
We have received *no* non-public information.  I've seen posts elsewhere by
other *BSD people implying that they receive little or no prior warning, so
I have no reason to believe this was specific to OpenBSD and/or our
philosophy.  Personally, I do find it....amusing? that public announcements
were moved up after the issue was deduced from development discussions and
commits to a different open source OS project.  Aren't we all glad that
this was under embargo and strongly believe in the future value of
embargoes?
</div>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Linux distributors have been working up their fixes, which typically
need to be done to older kernels, especially for the enterprise
distributions.  Because of the lead time needed for QA and the like,
enterprise distributions have backported the KAISER work into their
kernels, rather than the more recent KPTI work.  That led Kroah-Hartman to
follow their lead for the 4.4 and 4.9 stable trees in order to try to be
"bug for bug compatible" with the enterprise distributions.  There are, it
seems, lots of users of kernel series that are no longer supported out
there.  Meltdown and Spectre provide more evidence, if it really is needed,
that continuing to run old, out-of-date kernels is a terrifically risky
thing to do.
</p>

<p>
Essentially all of the work that has been merged so far is for the x86
architecture, though others are affected to various degrees.  ARM64 is the
most prominent of the affected architectures, though it is <a href="https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update">only
affected</a> by Meltdown in its high-end processors (<a
href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/speculative-execution">AMD
CPUs are not affected</a> by Meltdown at all).  Patches  to fix
the Meltdown problem on the ARM64 processors where it does exist are <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/log/?h=kpti">in
progress</a>, but will not be merged until the 4.16 merge window.  That
means they are not available to be added to stable trees currently, so
Kroah-Hartman suggests the <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/">Common Android
kernel tree</a>, which has branches that incorporate the fixes.  It is
likely that the 4.4 and 4.9 stable trees will never get those fixes, he
said:
<div class="BigQuote">
For the 4.4 and 4.9 LTS kernels, odds are these patches will never get
merged into them, due to the large number of prerequisite patches
required. All of those prerequisite patches have been long merged and
tested in the android-common kernels, so I think it is a better idea to
just rely on those kernel branches instead of the LTS release for ARM
systems at this point in time.
</div>
</p>

<p>
According to Kroah-Hartman, other operating systems (e.g. Windows, macOS)
do not yet have full Spectre fixes either.  Other architectures have not
had fixes for either Meltdown or Spectre, though some are believed
vulnerable.  The name "Spectre" was chosen, in
part, because the researchers believed "<q>it will haunt us for quite
some time</q>". That looks prescient.
</p>

<h4>Lessons learned?</h4>

<p>
There has been additional speculation that other, related problems are
either known or will be discovered before long.  Regardless, it seems
well-nigh certain 
that CPU security bugs of some kind will be found, so it behooves the
industry to try to figure out a less chaotic, and more successful, strategy
for handling these kinds of problems.
</p>

<p>
Much of the ire has been directed toward Intel, which seems to have taken
the lead on the response to these bugs.  In <a
href="/Articles/743712/">response</a> to one of the first Spectre-fix
postings, Linus Torvalds was characteristically blunt:
<div class="BigQuote">
I think somebody inside of Intel needs to really take a long hard look
at their CPU's, and actually admit that they have issues instead of
writing PR blurbs that say that everything works as designed.
<p>
.. and that really means that all these mitigation patches should be
written with "not all CPU's are crap" in mind.
<p>
Or is Intel basically saying "we are committed to selling you shit
forever and ever, and never fixing anything"?
<p>
Because if that's the case, maybe we should start looking towards the
ARM64 people more.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Thomas Gleixner, who was singled out for praise by Torvalds for his work in
getting 
the KPTI patches into shape for merging, also <a href="/Articles/743713/">did
not mince words</a>.  The Spectre bugs have been "fixed" in some
distribution kernels, but Gleixner was not impressed with what was done
there and is concerned that proper solutions are not being thought out in
the name of expediency, which will have long-term implications:
<div class="BigQuote">
We have neither the basic mitigations in place nor has anyone fully
understood the implications and possible further issues.
<p>
[...]
<p>
I've seen the insanities which were crammed into the distro kernels, which
have sysctls and whatever, but at the same time these kernels shipped in a
haste do not even boot on a specific class of machines. Great engineering
work.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He decried the "<q>disgusting big corporate games</q>" that required
him and others to go into panic mode over the past few months, when the
chip vendors knew about the problems <i>months</i> before the kernel
community was engaged (to the extent it was).  He noted that "brain" is not
an acronym for "<q>Big Revenue All Intelligence Nuked</q>" but it
certainly appears to him that it is being treated that way.
</p>

<p>
In general, the normal kernel review cycle is taking place for the Spectre
fixes, but there are 
some wrinkles.  Now that the vulnerabilities are public, there is increased
pressure to get some kind of fix, even one with an enormous performance
penalty, deployed in the near term.  That runs against "normal" kernel
thinking; Torvalds and others were <a href="/Articles/743717/">not
persuaded</a> by a "security trumps 
performance" argument.  Few, if any,  disagree in the abstract, but
Gleixner and others 
<a href="/Articles/743718/">would like to roll out the expedient fixes</a>;
after that, optimizations can be examined:
<div class="BigQuote">
The exploits are out in the wild and they are observed already, so we
really have to make a decision whether we want to fix that in the most
obvious ways even if it hurts performance right now and then take a break
from all that hell and sit down and sort the performance mess or whether we
want to discuss the right way to fix it for the next 3 month and leave all
doors open until the last bit of performance is squeezed out.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He suggested that a "performance first" attitude might lead him to taking
some overdue vacation time.  But James Bottomley <a
href="/Articles/743720/">said</a> that this is all part of the normal kernel
review process, which generally leads to better and faster solutions.  Alan
Cox <a href="/Articles/743721/">agreed</a>, but feels the urgency for an
immediate solution: "<q>I'd just prefer most users machines are
secure while we have the discussion and while we see what other
architectural tricks people can come up with</q>".
</p>

<p>
All of that discussion is pretty normal stuff for the kernel mailing list.
The problem is that it is happening after the disclosure of the bugs, so
there is a big (and highly public) clamor.  Security bugs are frequently
handled privately by the team behind security@kernel.org, but that
mechanism apparently was not used here.  As Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/Articles/743729/">outlined</a>, that led to this  sad state
of affairs:
<div class="BigQuote">
I will note that the "controlled disclosure" for this thing was a total
and complete mess, and unlike any that I have ever seen in the past.
The people involved in running it had no idea how to do it at all, and
because of that, it failed miserably, despite being warned about it
numerous times by numerous people.
<p>
[...]
<p>
Because that group was so small and isolated that they did not actually
talk to anyone who could actually provide input to help deal with the
bug.
<p>
So we are stuck now with dealing with this "properly", which is fine,
but please don't think that this is an excuse to blame "controlled
disclosure".  We know how to do that correctly, it did not happen in
this case at all because of the people driving the problem refused to do
it.
</div>
</p>

<p>
We will be digging out from Meltdown and Spectre for a long time.  With
luck, those responsible have learned that there are better ways to handle
bugs of this nature (or any other) in the future.  It's vanishingly
unlikely that we won't 
hit this situation again—CPUs are extremely complex beasts and will only
get more so as nearly anything gets sacrificed on the altar of
performance.  The CPU vendors—and any who enabled them (e.g. Google,
Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and so on)—should take a hard look at their
practices and this incident in particular.  Hopefully, they (and we) will
 learn something from it moving forward.
</p>

<p>
We also owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of the different folks who
worked on getting us this far.  Many of them worked over the holidays when
they might have been doing something much more fun than cleaning up this
mess.  By delaying the involvement of the kernel team—and setting
January&nbsp;9 as the coordinated release date—whoever was driving
the disclosure bus did no one any favors.  Six months is an enormous window
for an embargo, it is somewhat surprising it held up as long as it did.  In
the end, though, that embargo length may possibly have given attackers a longer
run time; it definitely turned the kernel-fixing piece into a fiasco.  Some
rethinking is clearly in order.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Disclosure: I work for Red Hat, but wasn't involved in any early disclosure of this, for my role. So all I know is what I've heard/inferred from others. Of *course*, all of this is my personal opinion, and not all RH's official opinion or position, please don't read or cite it as such, I am in no position to speak officially on behalf of RH on this.<br>
<p>
But without going into any specifics or anything I don't think I'm allowed to talk about, one significant point I've seen is that this has been a bit of an unprecedented situation.<br>
<p>
The disclosure/embargo processes for vulnerabilities that can be addressed at a single point are, by now, pretty mature and well-understood, whatever you think of them, and people in general know how to follow them.<br>
<p>
One reason why this one seems to have been a bit of a mess, it seems to be generally agreed, is that this was *not* a single vulnerability that could be addressed in a single piece of software, or by a single vendor. Insofar as there *was* a plan that multiple people/companies agreed on (again, this is just my reading of it), it seems to have involved at least multiple CPU manufacturers, OS vendors (counting commercial Linux distributors in that), cloud providers, hardware suppliers, and even higher-level software vendors, notably browsers. And probably more that I forgot about / don't know about. I rather suspect that the reasons behind some OS vendors/distributors apparently not being involved in the process is simple cock-up rather than conspiracy; I don't think there was a well-run authority somewhere with a Master List of people and companies who ought to get pulled into this, it was all being cooked up ad hoc.<br>
<p>
Anyway, even without the ones who got left out, that's a *lot* of people and companies all with their own timeframes and agendas, all involved in a process that's really never happened before. And going by what I've heard, there wasn't really a common understanding beforehand of exactly how such a complex and lengthy embargo process ought to work. It seems to me like everyone had sort of a vague idea, but all the details were getting worked out as things went along.<br>
<p>
So that would be an obvious source of confusion, and problems like articles that disclosed or implied the existence of the vulnerabilities getting published, and the mess with the KAISER patch set cluing people in that something was going on.<br>
<p>
It seems like some well-intentioned folks are trying to kickstart efforts to try and improve how this sort of problem gets handled in future; let's hope those work out...<br>

Thanks for sharing the RH perspective; we were also working flat-out at Canonical from the moment we were notified. In some ways, it's surprising how well this ended up being coordinated across the parties that had been notified; that the embargo only broke 6 days prior to the original date is also notable. It was definitely not ideal, but it could have gone a lot worse, and it shows the calibre and commitment of the people involved.<br>
<p>
Parties that didn't get notified did get the short end of the stick, though. I don't know what can be done to improve that, perhaps other than better formalization of their relationships with the other major players in the security space (which for-profit distributors like us end up having as byproducts of our commercial engagements).<br>

You're welcome, but as I went to lots of pains to point out, that's *not* the RH perspective :) It's my perspective. I was not significantly involved in RH's response to this at all: I wasn't part of the embargo team and my entire contribution so far has been to help get some Fedora updates pushed promptly the day of the disclosure.<br>

Uh, NO.  He went out of his way to say it was NOT the RH perspective.

Of *course*, all of this is my personal opinion, and not all RH's official opinion or position, please don't read or cite it as such, I am in no position to speak officially on behalf of RH on this.</blockquote>

So if I'm reading this right, a fair summary would be that it's a massive problem that affects damn near everybody, everything is broken at every layer, and the scope of it makes a "perfect" coordinated announcement/fix an impossible exercise in cat-herding. :D<br>

Kidding aside, thanks for a perspective from someone in the trenches.  This whole thing seems like a complex and unpleasant issue, so props to everyone dealing with it!<br>

Indeed it is amazing that "..it is somewhat surprising it held up as long as it did..". From my own timeline data gathering, Jan Wildeboer's public time line, it seems that the embargo held well until Dec-2018. <br>
<p>
Looking at Ubuntu's timeline, it seems as if, the embargo held well till late 2017, because multiple affected parties (like Ubuntu) were not even informed?<br>

The "embargo" period includes disclosure to selected parties (Apple/Microsoft/Amazon presumably sometime between August and October, some Linux distros in November, etc.). The embargo held up officially until January 3, and had only started eroding a couple days earlier.<br>

Unless I'm very much mistaken, there is no general 32-bit i686 fix for Meltdown, only x86_64 has been fixed. Not surprising, most distros have dropped, or are dropping, i68. But apparently there are still users out there.<br>

<p>
One of the "selling points" of Linux has always been that it can help to make use of older computers, and some smaller distros specialize in this. On the other hand, if you run a sufficiently old CPU with no speculation, you are not vulnerable. But than means going back to Pentium I, doesn't it?

      <blockquote>But than means going back to Pentium I, doesn't it?</blockquote>

The Pentium already had a branch predictor (including a BTB for indirect branches), although probably only speculative instruction fetching and decoding, not execution.  For Meltdown, anything with a cache would be affected, including the faster 386 systems, no?

I think Meltdown could affect in-order CPUs, in principle, depending on details of their pipeline. If you use the output of an illegal load instruction as the address for the next load instruction, the CPU might quickly bypass the value from the first instruction to the second and run the second instruction through a couple of pipeline stages, before realising that the first instruction generated an exception and cancelling the subsequent instructions.<br>
<p>
That would be superficially safe if the second instruction gets cancelled before it commits any writes to memory(/cache/buffers/etc) or to registers; but it might have got as far as allocating or evicting cache lines or TLB entries, which is still observable behaviour. If the illegal load returned the protected data (instead of replacing it with 0s or stalling the pipeline or whatever) then that'd be equivalent to Meltdown.<br>
<p>
Since you wouldn't be performing the illegal load inside a mispredicted branch, you'd still have to deal with a real page fault, which likely disturbs the cache and makes the effects harder to observe. And you almost certainly wouldn't have time to put any arithmetic instructions between your two loads - you'd have to rely on just the base+offset arithmetic in the load itself, which makes it more awkward to extract the value. But it doesn't seem clearly impossible.<br>
<p>
In practice, I don't know if any in-order CPUs actually have pipelines that could be vulnerable - it probably requires the exception-handling stage to be unrealistically late. (I checked the documentation for an old MIPS one and it looks like the pipeline is very slightly too short, though I don't understand enough to be sure.)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;IIRC someone on LWN mentioned that grsec had x86_32 fixes.</font><br>
A reminder: i386 and x86_32 have different places in the architecture tree. i386 is the old 32-bit memory space and 4+4 registers (plus SSE); x86_32 is the 16 registers (plus vectors) of AMD64 mode with 32-bit memory pointers in a 48-bit physical/64-bit virtual memory space. <br>
<p>
If your processes can live inside a 4GiB envelope, and you need the performance benefit of CPU-memory bandwith not swallowed by long memory addresses, and you have a chip with AMD64 or 'EM64-T' (as Intel called it) instruction set, you might choose to use x86_32 -- but I think almost nobody does.<br>

You are talking about x86_x32, which is an ilp32 ABI supported by the x86_64 kernel subarch, and thus covered by the x86_64 patches already merged. x86_32 is the kernel subarch also known as i386/i486/i586/i686.<br>

i686 and as far back as 486 is actively in use in embedded systems, some even Internet-connected.<br>
<p>
The case is the same as with old ARM platforms that I personally struggle to maintain: embedded systems have 20+ years support cycles, and people working with only laptops, desktops and servers in mind don't think they exist. It is one of the big disconnects in our community.<br>
<p>
However many of these systems are never updated to newer kernels because of misc fears. But they should, that culture also needs to change.<br>

<p>
Demanding that makes sense only if slimming a modern kernel to fit their limitations is even possible... Also the old device drivers they need may have bit-rotted.

Quite. Heck, there are probably quite a lot of customers of the late lamented Soekris machines (which used Geodes and then Atoms) that are still using them, 32-bit or no, because they sit in a corner (or nailed to a wall) and *just work*, and because it's hard to find anything which is a small form-factor general-purpose computer (as opposed to a router) for less than insane money with that many NICs. I still see lots of alleged embedded firewall boxes with two or three NICs. No thank you, four expandable to eight is my minimum :)<br>

It's not about "Linux", though. It's about the Linux kernel, major Linux distributors, Windows, macOS, microcode from at least four CPU manufacturers delivered both by microcode_ctl and its equivalents on other platforms _and_ by system firmware (which pulls major hardware vendors into the mix), major cloud platforms, and even browser vendors...all of whom were attempting to keep a shared secret and co-ordinate disclosure and remediation of not just one vulnerability, but a family of related vulnerabilities and the general concept behind them, some of which don't really even have any clear and simple fix.<br>

But how many of them have "nothing" to do with the linux community?<br>
<p>
In quotes because of course there's some interaction, but why would for example Microsoft concern itself with how Linux handles vulnerabilities?<br>
<p>
The problem, as *so* *often* is the case, is that when the needs suddenly scale dramatically, the infrastructure can't respond and scale similarly. No blame to anyone, that's just reality doing what reality does ...<br>

<h1>Kernel Summit: Class-based Kernel Resource Management</h1>

The <a href="http://ckrm.sourceforge.net/">class-based kernel resource
management</a> work was presented by Rik van Riel and Shailabh Nagar.  The
basic idea behind CKRM is that it:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Organizes processes and sockets into groups.  This organization 
     can be done in a number of ways using pluggable classifier modules.
     Typical schemes include the user on whose behalf things are running or
     the program that is being run.
<p>
<li> Applies a policy on how much of the system each class is allowed 
     to use.  Resource usage which can be controlled includes CPU usage,
     memory usage, I/O bandwidth, etc.
</ol>
<p>
The whole thing is configured through a virtual filesystem; creating a new
group is just a matter of making a new directory in that filesystem.
The normal Unix permissions apply in this directory; depending on how they
are set, non-root users can make changes to some or all resource policies. 
<p>
Uses for this mechanism include workload consolidation (restricting parts
of the system's workloads to a given amount of resource usage), quality of
service guarantees for network services or individual users, etc.  CKRM can
limit the amount of memory used by OpenOffice (<i>something</i> has to do
that) or give a database manager process priority access to the machine. 
<p>
Linus objected to the term "guarantees," claiming that any attempt to
provide resource guarantees will lead to poor performance, deadlocks, or
both.  
<p>
Alternatives to CKRM were quickly presented.  Virtualization works for some
sorts of resource limitation tasks, but do not work well on the desktop and
can suffer from latency problems.  Various user-mode solutions, such as
"zapper daemons," are unable to respond to quick surges in resource use.
<p>
There were various objections to the CKRM implementation; some called it
over-engineered.  Linus would like to see the general resource classes
split into separate classes for every type of resource which is being
controlled.  It may be desirable to put a process into one class for its
CPU usage, but another one altogether for controlling its I/O bandwidth.
Various other implementation changes were requested as well.  CKRM will
likely find its way into the kernel at some point, but it will likely need
another iteration or two through the developer review process first.

      I'm the sysadmin of a small to medium business network. We run a dual Xeon <br>server to host file services (NetATalk, Samba, and NFS), intranet web <br>services, LTSP thin clients, and mail services. As you can imagine, this <br>does not always go smoothly ... but it works OK overall, and it could go a <br>lot more smoothly than it does now. <br> <br>I'm going to present a wishlist that attempts to briefly explain what I'd <br>find useful and why I think it'd be good. I'm not claiming that any of it <br>is easy, or even that it's a good idea in the interests of the system as a <br>whole - I lack the knowledge to evaluate that. All I can say is &quot;I think <br>this would be very useful...&quot; <br> <br>It would be very helpful to be able to control resource allocation to <br>processes in a more flexible and CONSISTENT way than provided by `nice` <br>and `ulimit`. In particular: <br> <br>	- Disk I/O QoS, so we could (say) configure &quot;user&quot; applications to <br>get priority for quick, brief disk access while limiting the IO ops/second <br>and throughput of file services to just below the disk's ability. Another <br>example might be limiting the disk throughput and IO/sec usage of a large, <br>low priority copy operation like archiving an LVM snapshot to removable <br>storage or cloning an experimental version of a database. <br> <br>	- Per-process disk usage monitoring. &quot;Dammit, why is the /home <br>array thrashing...&quot; <br> <br>	- Memory limits that start paging processes out instead of killing <br>them if they exceed the limit, so it's possible to say (for example) that <br>the group 'users' may collectively consume no more than 50% of system <br>memory. <br> <br>	- Making CPU and memory limitatation consistent. I'm not convinced <br>the CPU time ulimit makes any sense in a modern computing environment, and <br>while I find the 'kill when exceeded' memory ulimit great for limiting the <br>damage done by crashing processes it'd be nice to be able to have less <br>drastic control over the system resources they use as well. See above <br>point. <br>	 <br>	- Memory priorities for processes. &quot;If you have to free up some <br>space, get rid of the database cache first, please DO NOT page out the <br>binaries of my interactive applications, my thin client users happen to be <br>using those...&quot; <br> <br>	- The ability to do large, one-off copies without driving <br>everything remotely useful out of the in-memory disk cache. This is a <br>MAJOR problem in my experience. It is nigh impossible to do any seriously <br>large copies on an active Linux server (in my experience) if there are any <br>reasonably interactive tasks. Even if the interactive tasks don't normally <br>even touch the disk(s) you're using for the big copy, they'll quickly get <br>sluggish and start swapping or having to repeatedly load parts of <br>libraries and files from disk. This appears to be because all the <br>previously cached data - silly things like glibc and the program binaries <br>- are being pushed out of the disk cache in favour of data from the copy <br>operation that will never be re-used. This issue makes things like backups <br>of live servers a much higer impact affair than they could be, especially <br>combined with the apparent lack of any way of rate-limiting copy <br>operations. <br> <br>	- The ability to configure and control disk, memory, CPU access, <br>and other forms of resource limitation and QoS from a single consistent <br>interface (say, sysfs). Ideally policies might be applied to a group of <br>related proceses (as `ulimit` and friends do currently) or to all <br>processes owned by a particular user or group. Imagine &quot;No single user may <br>use more than 80% of the network bandwidth&quot; or &quot;This group of virtual <br>machines is limited to 50% of physical system memory (and will begin <br>paging out instead of crashing if it exceeds it) <br> <br>Currently, it seems very hard to get different sorts of services to play <br>well together on the same server. For good utilisation and to limit the <br>number of servers that need to be managed, it would be nice to change <br>this. Many of the things needed to make (say) a thin client server andm <br>mail server live acceptably well on the same box will no doubt also <br>benefit virtualisation schemes like LVS and UML. After all, they, too, <br>want ways to prevent different VMs that might be doing different things <br>from treading on each other too badly. <br> <br>In fact, I'd eventually love to be able to move my thin client services <br>into one virtual space (think BSD Jail, LVS, UML, etc), mail into another, <br>etc with minimal resource overheads. The management benefits would be <br>pleasant - upgrade your terminal server environment reguarly to get shiny <br>new GUI improvements, while keeping your mail server environment unchanged <br>for as long as humanly possible. <br> <br>I think Linux is already ahead of some contenders when it comes to many <br>things efficiently sharing one system, but in my opinion there's still a <br>lot of room for improvement. <br> <br>Of course, I'm just a lowly sysadmin and probably don't understand the <br>complexity of what I'm talking about. What the heck - these are wants and <br>needs, and I'm interested in how they translate into anything that could <br>make its way into reality outside an IBM mainframe.  <br> <br>Comments appreciated. <br> <br>-- <br>Craig Ringer <br>craig &lt;at&gt; postnewspapers [dot] com &gt;d0t&lt; au

From LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2005/">2005 Kernel Summit
coverage</a>. 
</td></tr></table>

Monday's final session was a discussion of a number of virtual filesystem
topics, led by Suparna Bhattacharya.  There was no overriding theme to this
session; it was more a collection of outstanding issues.
<p>

The first of these issues is <tt>mm/filemap.c</tt> in the kernel source.
This code once used to be readable, but it has turned into a complicated
mess.  As an example, consider a function like
<tt>generic_file_write()</tt>, whose purpose should be obvious from its
name.  In fact, it is not so generic; <tt>filemap.c</tt> contains:
<p>
<pre>
    generic_write_checks()
    generic_file_write()
    generic_file_writev()
    generic_file_direct_write()
    generic_file_buffered_write()
    generic_file_write_nolock()
    generic_file_aio_write()
    generic_file_aio_write_nolock()
</pre>
<p>
As the VFS has gotten more complicated, and, in particular, as it has
gained support for features like direct I/O, the interfaces have gotten
somewhat out of control.  Locking, in particular, has become complex, with
different I/O modes having different locking regimes.
The VFS is now almost unapproachable for many
programmers.
<p>

One possibility for simplifying things would be to eliminate the concurrent
direct and buffered I/O on the same file.  If only one mode of access had
to be considered (perhaps enforced by way of a mount or chattr option), some of the
code could be simplified.  It was quickly determined, however, that the
kernel would have to continue to support both modes of access on the same
file.  Otherwise, for example, how might one back up a file which is
currently under direct I/O (assuming that is a smart thing to do in the
first place, of course)?  Direct I/O is also something which must be done
with great care; an application must be aware of what it is doing.  So any
sort of option which would cause unaware applications to perform direct I/O
would lead to certain failure.
<p>

Wim Coekaerts noted that his group has written patches for a number of GNU
utilities (such at <tt>tar</tt>) enabling them to perform direct I/O.
Those patches have never been accepted, however.
<p>

One way of simplifying the situation, and helping user space as well, would
be to provide support for preallocation of blocks in files.  Something
along the lines of the <tt><a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_fallocate.html">posix_fallocate()</a></tt>
function.  This idea made sense to most; it just needs somebody to
implement it.
<p>

Another helpful change would be to put direct I/O pages into the page
cache; then many locking issues simply go away.  Of course, the whole point
of direct I/O is to avoid the page cache.  So the page cache entries would
have to point to the existing user-space pages, perhaps by way of
some sort of virtual <tt>struct page</tt>.  This is a scary idea; there is
a great deal of kernel code which assumes that each <tt>page</tt> structure
corresponds to a physical page in memory.  Changing such a fundamental
assumption in a safe way could be a challenge; that said, the task would
almost certainly be easier now than it would have been a few years ago.
<p>

The continuing existence of buffer heads has been raised as a problem more
than once this day.  They come about as a result of mismatches between the
filesystem block size and the system's page size; buffer heads are also
used in the ext3 journaling code.  Buffer heads have been around forever,
but they have to live in low memory (which can be scarce on big systems),
and they require the existence of separate code paths to deal with them.
Nonetheless, getting rid of buffer heads in the near future will be hard,
and whatever replaces them may turn out to be just as complex.
<p>

Delayed allocation, multi-block allocation, and extents were also pointed
out as desirable features.  The question: should they be implemented within
individual filesystems, or as generic code in the VFS layer?  Linus stated
that he tends to be against generic code when it starts to get complex.  If
things get too twisted, it can be better to have simpler,
filesystem-specific implementations.  His suggestion was to fix the
<tt>filemap.c</tt> mess first; once that has been simplified, one can
consider adding other generic capabilities to the VFS layer.

<p>
There are lock ordering issues which will have to be faced at some point.
Multi-block allocations naturally call for a lock ordering regime (specific
locks first, then more general locks) which is contrary to what is done now.
Cluster filesystems will create the need to lock multiple inodes at once;
at that point, the order in which those locks is taken is of crucial
importance.  Lock ordering mistakes can lead to system deadlocks.

<p>
The shared subtree patches were mentioned briefly.  Shared subtrees come
out of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/119232/">a suggestion by Al
Viro</a>; they are intended as a way to make the same filesystem tree be
simultaneously available in multiple parts of the system namespace.  This
proposal is, among other things, a response to some of the things the
reiser4 filesystem is trying to do.  Unfortunately, Al Viro was not able to
attend the summit, and few developers had looked at this patch.  So there
was not much discussion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm still hoping to see variant symlinks, as in Apollo Aegis and, lately, Dragonfly BSD.  In a variant symlink, if the link text is "$(HOME)/bin", it really points into your home directory.  For safety and backward compatibility, a process (or process group) would need to set a mode to request such expansion before it would occur, and (not incidentally) identify the environment to use.<br>
<p>
And how about an analog to NetBSD's UVM zero-copy read and write semantics?  In UVM, writes from and reads into buffers aligned to page boundaries are automatically zero-copy operations.  On NetBSD, sendfile() can be implemented as an ordinary library function.  Of course this affects more than just the VFS.<br>

      Data General's DG-UX SysV-based UNIX also had variant symlinks.  Very handy in many situations.<br>

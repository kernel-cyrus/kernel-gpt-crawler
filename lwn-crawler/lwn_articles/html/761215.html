One might think that memory allocation during system startup should not be
difficult: almost all of memory is free, there is no concurrency,
and there are no background tasks that will compete for memory. Even so,
boot-time memory management is a tricky task. Physical memory is not
necessarily contiguous, its extents change from system to system, and
the detection of those extents may be not trivial. With NUMA things
are even more complex because, in order to satisfy allocation
locality, the exact memory topology must be determined.
To cope with this, sophisticated mechanisms for memory management are
required even 
during the earliest stages of the boot process.
<p>
One could ask: "so why not
use the same allocator that Linux uses normally from the very beginning?" The
problem is that the primary Linux page allocator is a complex beast and it, too,
needs to allocate memory to initialize itself. Moreover, the page-allocator
data structures should be allocated in a NUMA-aware way.  So another solution
is required to get to the point where the memory-management subsystem can become
fully operational.
<p>
In the early days, Linux didn't have an early memory allocator; in the 1.0
kernel, memory initialization was not as robust and versatile as it is
today. Every subsystem initialization call, or simply any function called
from <tt>start_kernel()</tt>, had access to the starting address of the
single block of free memory via the global <tt>memory_start</tt>
variable. If a function needed to allocate memory it just 
increased <tt>memory_start</tt> by the desired amount. By the time v2.0 was
released, Linux was already ported to five more architectures, but 
boot-time memory management remained as simple as in v1.0, with the only
difference being that the extents of the physical memory were detected by the
architecture-specific code. It should be noted, though, that hardware in
those days was much simpler and memory configurations could be detected
more easily.
<p>

Up until version 2.3.23pre3, all early memory allocations used global
variables indicating the beginning and end of free memory and adjusted them
accordingly. Luckily, the page and slab allocators were available early, so
heavy memory users, such as <tt>buffers_init()</tt> and
<tt>page_cache_init()</tt>, could use them.  Still, as hardware evolved and
became more sophisticated, the architecture-specific code dealing with
memory had grown quite a bit of complex cruft.
<p>

The 2.3.23pre3 patch set included the first bootmem allocator
implementation, which used a bitmap to represent the status of each
physical memory
page. Cleared bits identified available pages, while set
bits meant that the corresponding memory pages were busy or absent. All
the generic functions that tweaked <tt>memory_start</tt> and the i386
initialization code were converted to use bootmem, but other
architectures were left behind. They were converted by the time
version 2.3.48 was ready. Meanwhile, Linux was ported to Itanium
(ia64), which was the first architecture to start off using bootmem.
<p>

Over time, memory detection has evolved from simply asking the
BIOS for the size of the extended memory block to dealing with complex
tables, pieces, banks, and clusters.  In particular, the Power64
architecture came prepared, bringing with it the <a
href="/Articles/387083/">Logical Memory Block
allocator</a> (or LMB). With LMB, memory is represented as two arrays of
regions. The first array describes the physically contiguous memory areas
available in the system, while the second array tracks allocated
regions. The LMB allocator made its way into 32-bit
PowerPC when the 32-bit and 64-bit architectures  were merged. Later on it
was adopted by 
SPARC. Eventually LMB made its way to other architectures and became
what is now known as memblock.
<p>

The memblock allocator provides two basic primitives that are used as
the base for more complex allocation APIs:
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memblock.c#L596"><tt>memblock_add()</tt></a>
for registering a physical memory range, and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memblock.c#L714"><tt>memblock_reserve()</tt></a>
to mark a range as busy.  Both of these are based, in the end, on <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memblock.c#L489"><tt>memblock_add_range()</tt></a>,
which adds a range to either of the two arrays.
<p>

The major drawback of bootmem is the bitmap initialization. To create
this bitmap, it is necessary to know the physical memory
configuration. What is the correct size of the bitmap? Which memory bank has
enough contiguous physical memory to store the bitmap? And, of course,
as memory sizes increase so does the bootmem bitmap. For a system with
32GB of RAM, the bitmap will require 1MB of that memory.


Memblock, on the other hand, can be used immediately as it is based on
static arrays large enough to accommodate, at least, the very first
memory registrations and allocations. If a request to add or reserve
more memory would overflow a memblock array, the array is doubled in
size. There is an underlying assumption that, by the time that
may happen, enough memory will be added to memblock to sustain the allocation
of the new arrays.
<p>

The design of memblock relies on the assumption that there will be relatively few
allocation and deallocation requests before the primary page allocator
is up and running.  It  does not need to be especially smart,
since its lifetime is limited before it hands off all the memory
to the buddy page allocator.
<p>

To ease the pain of transition from bootmem to memblock, a
compatibility layer called <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/nobootmem.c">nobootmem</a>
was introduced.  Nobootmem 
provides (most of) the same interfaces as bootmem, but
instead of using the bitmap to mark busy pages it relies on memblock
reservations.
As of v4.17, only five out of 24 architectures are still using bootmem as
the only early memory allocator; 14 use memblock with
nobootmem. The remaining five use memblock and bootmem at the same
time.
<p>

Currently there is ongoing work on enabling the use of memblock with
nobootmem on all architectures. Several architectures that use device
trees have been converted as a consequence of recent changes in early
memory management in the device-tree drivers.
There are patches for alpha, c6x, m68k, and nios2
that are already published. Some of them are already merged by the
arch maintainers while some are still under review.
<p>

Hopefully, by the 4.20  merge window all 
architectures will cease using bootmem; after that it will be possible
to start a major cleanup of the early memory management code.
That work would include removing the bootmem allocator and several kernel
configurations associated with it.  That, in turn, should make it possible to
start moving more early-boot functionality from the architecture-specific
subtrees into common code.  There is never a lack of problems to solve in
the memory-management subsystem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hi Mike.<br>
<p>
Thanks for this nice write-up of the current status of getting rid of bootmem.<br>
Nice work.<br>
Some years ago I was looking into replacing the homegrown bootmem allocator<br>
used by sparc32 but that work was never finished.<br>
There was some issues related to the configuration of the TLB,<br>
and I also recall that the highmem configuration was a little tricky.<br>
I have looked around, but the patches are long gone so no help there.<br>
<p>
When you start to look at the sparc32 conversion I will be glad to<br>
review the effort.<br>
<p>

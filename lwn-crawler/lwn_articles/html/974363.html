<p>
Vineeth Pillai gave a remote talk at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> explaining how BPF could be
used to improve the performance of virtual machines (VMs). Pillai has
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240403140116.3002809-1-vineeth@bitbyteword.org/">
a patch
set</a> designed to let guest and host machines share scheduling information in
order to eliminate some of the overhead of running in a VM. The assembled
developers had several comments on the design, but seemed overall to approve of
the prospect.
</p>

<p>
VMs have a variety of potential performance footguns, but a particularly
persistent one is "double scheduling". When using KVM, the implementation of a
virtual machine hypervisor in the Linux kernel, virtual CPUs correspond to
threads. This means that the host system's scheduler will assign the
thread for a given virtual CPU to a physical CPU, and then the guest system's
scheduler will assign threads to those virtual CPUs. This results in a certain
amount of unavoidable overhead just from running two schedulers, but it also
increases the amount of jumping around between physical cores that processes on
the guest need to tolerate.
</p>

<p>
This problem can be partially mitigated using CPU pinning, but that is a manual
solution that still doesn't address the more subtle aspect of double scheduling:
that useful information is lost between the two schedulers. Pillai and his
collaborator Joel Fernandes
have been working on a solution that allows the guest and host to
share scheduling information, allowing the host scheduler to make more
intelligent decisions about where to put vCPU threads and how to schedule them.
</p>

<p>
To make this work, their proposed system would use memory shared between the
guest and the host. The guest runs a <tt>pvsched</tt> driver that allocates
the necessary memory and shares it with the host. The driver then streams
relevant scheduling information into that memory, and reads any information that the
host wants to provide in return. The most recent version of the patch set is
version 2, published in April, but Pillai is
already working on a version 3 to address comments from the KVM maintainers.
</p>

<p>
On the host side, this scheme is integrated into the scheduler using BPF. The
BPF program reads information from KVM, including the PIDs and
assigned physical CPUs of the virtual CPU threads, and the location of the
guest's shared memory, from a BPF map.
The BPF program can then make scheduling decisions, and
call hooks in the scheduler to override its decisions about how to schedule the
virtual CPUs, Pillai said.
</p>

<p>
David Vernet asked whether it would make sense to define a (supposedly
immutable) user-space API around the <tt>pvsched</tt> driver, or whether it
would make sense to do communication wholly over a BPF channel. BPF interfaces
are not considered part of the kernel's API stability promises — but the KVM
interface to guest VMs is. Pillai responded that the idea of using a BPF-to-BPF
channel makes sense. Vernet later suggested adding a new BPF map
type that goes directly between the host and the guest.
Pillai concurred with the idea of a guest-to-host map type.
</p>

<p>
Pillai said they did have one question about the design for the assembled
developers — should their patch set use <tt>struct_ops</tt> callbacks or raw
tracepoints to hook into the KVM subsystem? Vernet questioned whether Pillai
was proposing calling kfuncs (to manipulate the scheduler) from inside a
tracepoint. Pillai agreed that he was. Steven Rostedt pointed out that calling
kfuncs from some tracepoints could deadlock the scheduler, so you would need
some kind of allowlist of which tracepoints could be used this way.
</p>

<p>
Vernet agreed, suggesting that you could use a per-CPU variable to check whether
the BPF function associated with a tracepoint was being called from one of the
allowed locations.
Rostedt responded by asking whether this was something that the verifier could
check. Vernet indicated that this was not yet possible — and that it was an
example of the need for more granularity around deciding how kfuncs can be
called, as he suggested in <a href="/Articles/974102">his earlier session on
polymorphic kfuncs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt pointed out that an advantage of using tracepoints is that there would
be no need to add anything to the KVM subsystem to support it, since
<tt>vmm_enter()</tt> and <tt>vmm_exit()</tt> (functions that bracket any code
being run in the virtual machine) already have tracepoints. Pillai
clarified that those tracepoints are too late for their purposes. Rostedt
suggested that it could make sense to ask the KVM maintainers whether those
could be moved.
</p>

<p>
The audience had some concerns about the entire idea of opening up the ability
to override the scheduler in this way. Rostedt noted that once the possibility
exists for BPF to change the scheduler properties of a thread, there will be more uses for
that than just this KVM change. Vernet said that this was a question for the
scheduling folks, pointing out that user space can already do it "but they
probably don't want BPF setting scheduler knobs".
</p>

<p>
Despite some questions about the implementation, everyone seemed receptive to
the idea of eliminating the double-scheduling problem. When Pillai finishes
the third version of the patch set,
we will see whether the KVM and scheduler maintainers feel the
same way.

I was under the impression that if this work were to be merged, the driver API would maybe be unstable only if they choose to implement it in BPF, and even then, I would assume that the maintainers for this particular feature would go through the effort of keeping the interface stable. <br>

"<q>File systems benchmarking is in a state of disarray.</q>" This
stark and undisputed summary comes from the introduction to
"<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/impressions-fast09.pdf">Generating
Realistic Impressions for File-System Benchmarking [PDF]</a>"
by <a href="http://www.nec-labs.com/~nitin/">Nitin Agrawal</a>, Andrea
Arpaci-Dusseau, and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.  This paper describes
Impressions, a tool for generating realistic, reproducible file system
images which can serve as the base of new file system benchmarks.
<p>

First, a little history.  We, the file systems research and
development community, unanimously agree that most of our current
widely used file system benchmarks are deeply flawed.  The Andrew
benchmark, originally created around 1988, is not solely a file system
benchmark and is so small that it often fits entirely in-cache on
modern computers.  Postmark (c. 1997) creates and deletes small files
in a flat directory structure without any <code>fsync()</code> calls;
often the files are deleted so quickly that they never get written to
disk.  The company that created Postmark,
Netapp, <a href="http://communities.netapp.com/thread/1521">stopped
hosting the Postmark code and tech report</a> on their web site,
forcing developers to pass around bootleg Postmark versions in a
bizarre instance of benchmark samizdat.
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsmark/">fs_mark</a>
(c. 2003) measures synchronous write workloads and is a useful
microbenchmark, but is in no way a general purpose file system
benchmarking
tool.  <a href="http://www.textuality.com/bonnie/">bonnie</a>
(c. 1990) and <a href="http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/">bonnie++</a>
(c. 1999) tend to benchmark the disk more than the file system.  In
general, run any file system benchmark and you'll find a file system
developer who will tell you why it is all wrong.
<p>

Why has no new general purpose file system benchmark gained widespread
use and acceptance since Postmark?  A new benchmark is a dangerous
creature to unleash on the world: if it becomes popular enough, years
of research and development can go into making systems perform better
on what could, in the end, be a misleading or useless workload.  "No
benchmark is better than a bad benchmark," is how the thinking goes,
at least in the academic file systems development community.  I've
seen several new benchmarks quashed over the years for minor
imperfections or lack of features.
<p>

However, creating excellent new file systems benchmarks is
difficult without intermediate work to build on, flawed though it may
be.  It's like demanding that architects go straight from grass huts
to skyscrapers without building stone buildings in between because
stone buildings would be an earthquake hazard.  As a result, the file
systems benchmarking community continues to live in grass huts.
<p>

<h4>Impressions: Building better file system images</h4>

One thing the file systems community can agree on: We need better file
system images to run our benchmarks on - a solid foundation for any
putative skyscrapers of the future.  The most accurate and
reproducible method of creating file system images is to make a copy
of a representative real-world file system at the block level and
write it back to the device afresh before each run of the benchmark.
Obviously, this approach is prohibitively costly in time, storage, and
bandwidth.  Creating a tarball of the contents of the file system, and
extracting it in a freshly created file system is nearly as expensive
and also loses the information about the layout of the file system, an
important factor in file system performance.  Creating all the files
at once and in directory order is a best case for the file system
block allocation code and won't reflect the real-world performance of
the file system when files are created and deleted over time.  In all
cases, it is impractical for other developers to reproduce the results
using the same file system images - no one wants to download (and
especially not host) several hundred gigabyte file system images.
<p>

This is where Impressions comes in.
Impressions is a relatively small, simple, open-source tool (about 3500
lines of C++) that generates a file system image satisfying multiple
sophisticated statistical parameters.  For example, Impressions
chooses file sizes using combinations of statistical functions with
multiple user-configurable parameters.  Impressions is deterministic:
given the same set of starting parameters and random seeds, it will
generate the same file system image (at the logical level - the
on-disk layout may not be the same).
<p>

<h4>Impressions: The details</h4>

The directory structure of the file system needs to have realistic
depth and distribution of both files and directories.  Impressions
begins with a directory creation phase that creates a target number of
directories.  The directories are distributed according to a function
of the current number of subdirectories of a particular directory,
based on a 2007 study of real-world file system directory structure.
A caveat here is that creating the directories separately from the
files will not properly exercise some important parts of file system
allocation strategy.  However, in many cases most of the directory
structure is static, and most the changes occur as creation and
deletion of files within directories, so creation of directories first
reflects an important real-world use case.
<p>

The distribution of file sizes can't be accurately modeled with any
straight-forward probability distribution function due to a second
"bump" in the file size distribution, which in modern file systems
begins around 512MB.  This heavy tail of file size distribution is
usually due to video files and disk images, and can't be ignored if
you care about the performance of video playback.  Impressions
combines two probability distribution functions, a log-normal and a
Pareto, with five user-configurable parameters to produce a realistic
file size distribution.
<p>

Files are assigned a depth in the directory tree according to "an
inverse polynomial of degree&nbsp;2."  Whatever that is (the code is
available for the curious), Figure 2(f) in the paper shows that the resulting
distribution of files by namespace depth is almost indistinguishable
from that in a real-world file system.  Impressions also supports
user-configurable "Special" directories with an exceptionally large
number of files in them, like <code>/lib</code>.

<p>
The authors of Impressions clearly understood the importance of
realistic file data; the example use case in the paper is performance
comparison of two desktop search applications, which depend heavily on
the actual content of files.  Filling all files with zeroes, or
randomly generated bytes, or repeats of the same pieces of text would
make Impressions useless for any benchmark that depends on file data,
such as those testing file system level deduplication or compression.
Impressions 
supports two modes of text file content generation, including a word
popularity model suitable for evaluation of file search applications.
It also creates files with proper headers for sound files, various
image and video formats, HTML, and PDF.
<p>

Generation of file names is rudimentary but includes advanced
support for realistic file name extensions, like <code>.mp3</code>.
The file name itself is just a number incremented by one each time a
file is created, but the extension is selected from a list of popular
extensions according to percentiles observed in earlier file system
studies.  Popular extensions only account for about half of file
names; the rest of the extensions are randomly generated.
<p>

One case in which file names generated this way won't be useful is in
evaluating a directory entry lookup algorithm.  Sequential search of a
directory for a particular directory entry isn't very efficient.
Instead, most modern file systems have some way to quickly map a
file name to its location in a directory, usually based on a hash of
the characters of the file name.  This mapping function may be more or
less efficient on Impression's sequential numerical file names compared
to real-world names.  File name length also influences
performance, since it changes the number of directory entries that fit
in a block.  Overall, file name generation in Impressions is good
enough, but there are opportunities for improvement.

<p>
One of the most important features of Impressions is its support for
deliberate fragmentation of the file system.  Impressions creates
fragmentation by writing part of a file, creating a new file, writing
another chunk of the file, and then deleting the new file.  This cycle
is repeated until the requested degree of fragmentation is achieved.
Note that file systems with good per-file preallocation may never
fragment in this scheme unless the disk space is nearly full or no
contiguous free stretches of disk space are left.  In this case,
fragmenting a file system to the requested degree may take a while.
More efficient methods of fragmenting a file system might be necessary
in the future.  Impressions could also use FIBMAP/FIEMAP to query the
layout of file systems in a portable manner; currently calculation of the
"fragmentation score" is only supported on ext2/3.
<p>

An interesting feature described in the paper but not available in the
version&nbsp;1 release of Impressions is support to run a specified number
of rounds of the fragmentation code - sort of a fragmentation
workload.  This will show the difference in disk allocation strategies
between file systems.  For example, if one file system manages
allocation well enough that it normally never exceeds 30%
discontiguous blocks, and the other normally always exceeds 60%
discontiguous blocks, it doesn't always make sense to compare their
performance when they are both at 50% discontiguous blocks.  Instead,
running a set fragmentation workload would result in different
"natural" fragmentation levels in both file systems, providing a more
realistic baseline for performance comparison.
<p>

<h4>Impressions development</h4>

Impressions is open sourced under the GPLv3 and
downloadable <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Software/Impressions/">here.</a>
The original author, Nitin Agrawal, has graduated (now at NEC Labs)
and does not currently have plans for developing Impressions further.
This is a rare golden opportunity for a new maintainer to work on an
influential, high-profile project.  The code is, in my opinion, easy
to understand and clearly written (although I've spent the last year
working on e2fsprogs and the VFS, so take that with a grain of salt).
Some open areas for contribution include:

<ul>

<li> Measure actual fragmentation using FIBMAP/FIEMAP

<li> Smarter filename generation

<li> Addition of hard links and symbolic links

<li> Performance improvement

<li> Scaling to larger file systems (&gt; 100GB)

<li> Packaging for distributions

<li> More robust error checking and handling

</ul>

Another possibility for future development is Lars
Wirzenius's <a href="http://braawi.org/genbackupdata/
"><code>genbackupdata</code></a> tool, written in Python.  The goal of
this tool is to generate a representative file system image for
testing a backup tool.  It already has some of the features of
Impressions and others appear to be easy to add.  Python may be a more
suitable language for long-term development and maintenance of a file
system creation tool.
<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Impressions is an enormous step forward in the file system
benchmarking world.  With a little polishing and a dedicated
maintainer, it could become the de facto standard for creating file
systems for benchmarking.  Impressions can report the full set of
parameters and random seeds it uses, which can then be used for
another Impressions run to recreate the exact same logical file system
(actual layout will vary some).  Impressions can be used today by file
system and application developers to create realistic, reproducible
file system images for testing and performance evaluation.

While I'm all for the use of rare words, I don't see how this definition of Samizdat fits what is happening to Postmark right now. The software is under the Artistic License, so nobody is prevented to put it up for download. That nobody took it over may say something about its usability. <br>

I like the basic strategy of creating fragmented files for testing using operations that actual programs use that tend to create fragmented files. If these fail to create fragmented files, then fragmented files may be less of an issue on the filesystem being benchmarked. On that principle, I think it might be worth trying to generate fragmentation by making a big sparse file and filling in blocks in random order.<br>

<h1>Diskdump: a new crash dump system</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 2, 2004 by corbet]

A standard feature of most commercial operating systems is a "crash dump"
facility.  If something goes wrong in the operating system kernel, the
system saves its entire state to a file and reboots; the contents of that
file can then be examined at leisure to try to figure out what went wrong.
The Linux kernel, however, lacks this capability.  There are a few possible
reasons for this omission: the kernel never crashes (not quite true,
unfortunately), kernel developers rarely want crash dumps for their own
work, and there is a certain degree of unhappiness with all of the crash
dump patches currently in circulation.  The fact of the matter, however, is
that a number of Linux vendors would like to have a good crash dump system
in place so they can better support their customers.
<p>
A <a href="/Articles/87039/">recent patch</a> posted by Takao Indoh may
provide that capability.  The new "diskdump" system has taken a
simpler approach to crash dumps that, with some fixes, may just get enough
core hacker support to be considered for merging into the (presumably 2.7)
mainline. 
<p>
Diskdump works by taking absolute control of the system when a panic
occurs.  It shuts down all interrupts to keep the processor from getting
distracted; it also freezes all other processors on SMP systems.  It then
checksums its own code, comparing against a value computed at
initialization time; if the checksums fail to match, diskdump assumes that
it has been corrupted as a result of whatever went wrong and refuses to
run.   
<p>
The next step involves finding a place to store the crash dump.  Diskdump
can be set up with multiple dump partitions.  For each possibility, it
queries the state of the driver, then reads and verifies the entire crash
dump space.  The diskdump authors are (rightly) fearful of overwriting
important data while the system is in an unstable state, so diskdump
requires that every block of the crash dump partition be initialized with a
special pattern.  If any blocks fail the test, that destination will not be
used. 
<p>
When a suitable location has been found, diskdump writes a header with the
system state and panic information, followed by a memory image.  At that
point the system can be rebooted; once things are stable again, the
"savecore" utility turns the memory image into a proper core dump and
reinitializes the crash dump partition.  All is then in readiness for
debugging and, if need be, the next crash.
<p>
Diskdump needs some significant block driver modifications to be able to do
its job.  The driver must export a new set of operations:
<p>
<pre>
    struct disk_dump_device_ops {
        int (*sanity_check)(struct disk_dump_device *);
        int (*quiesce)(struct disk_dump_device *);
        int (*shutdown)(struct disk_dump_device *);
        int (*rw_block)(struct disk_dump_partition *, int rw, unsigned long
            block_nr, void *buf);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>sanity_check()</tt> call checks to ensure that the device in
question is ready to accept a crash dump.  If that function finds that, for
example, the device is offline or somebody, somewhere is holding a spinlock
for the device, the sanity check will fail and the dump will have to go
somewhere else.  A call to <tt>quiesce()</tt> follows, in case any
preparation is needed.  The current implementation (which only works with
some SCSI devices) performs a full SCSI bus reset at this point.  The
actual I/O is done via <tt>rw_block</tt>, which is expected to transfer one
page per call.  This I/O should be done without interrupts (which are,
remember, disabled when the panic happens), so the typical implementation
will work by polling the device.  At the end, <tt>shutdown()</tt> is called
to ensure that all blocks have been flushed to the media.
<p>
Perhaps the ugliest part of the patch - and the part which some developers
have complained about - is the rerouting of timer and tasklet calls.  Since
all interrupts are disabled, the normal timer and software interrupt
mechanisms will not function.  Diskdump does not need those capabilities
itself, but a number of disk drivers do.  As a result, diskdump must,
somehow, run tasklets and timers expected by the driver, but without
running arbitrary code unrelated to the dump process.  To this end,
diskdump sets up its own private timer and tasklet lists which come into
action once the system is locked down and the dump process begins.
<p>
Currently, all this works by modifying the drivers to call diskdump's
functions rather than the core kernel variants.  So, for example, instead
of setting up a timer with <tt>add_timer()</tt>, a driver implementing
dumps would call this little wrapper:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline void diskdump_add_timer(struct timer_list *timer)
    {
        if (crashdump_mode())
            _diskdump_add_timer(timer);
        else
            add_timer(timer);
    }
</pre>
<p>
But that function is only available if crash dumps are configured into the
system, so some preprocessor macros are used to redefine
<tt>add_timer()</tt> if need be.  This solution is not going to make it
into the mainline kernel, however.  The preferred approach would appear to
be integrating this functionality directly into the core timer and tasklet
routines; that change will make the driver changes smaller, but at the cost
of intruding into some of the core kernel code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Red Hat kernels have had an alternative crash dump facility called 'netdump' in them for some time now<p>http://www.redhat.com/support/wpapers/redhat/netdump/<p>This dumps to a host on the network rather than local disk precisely to avoid some of the issues with complex disk controllers and interrupts.<p>&lt;quote&gt;<br>So what? There are two main problems that come up; failure to dump a memory image, and overwriting parts of file systems because the crash has damaged some data structures or code being used to do the dump. Do not laugh, the later happens in real life; failures in drivers, the SCSI layer, or other intermediate data structures or code is as common a place as any for bugs that cause a crash. A simple failure to dump the memory image is the more common of the two, and can be caused by a myriad of problems, including failures in interrupt handling (for example, interrupts being disabled at the time of the crash; a common problem), locks taken and not released, and data structures that are inconsistent at the time of the crash causing the system to wait forever.<p>By contrast, network devices are simple, are easy to modify to enable a non-interrupt-driven polled mode, and even if there is a bug in a network device driver, it is entirely likely not to disable the crash dump over the network, because the code path used for network crash dump is highly restricted. The entire network stack can crash and network crash dump can still work, because the network crash dump code implements a separate small but standard-compliant subset of the UDP protocol sufficient to perform the crash dump. Interrupts can be disabled, arbitrary locks can be held indefinitely, and the network crash dump will still function perfectly.<br>&lt;/quote&gt;

      Better than a core dump, which is the state of the system when the fault happened, a flight recorder (which is kind of tracer) would prove very helpfull to tell what sequence of actions (ie. function calls, exceptions, ..) brought to this situation.<p>Provided the system is equipped with some non volatile memory, the content of the flight recorder could be stored continuously, thus enabling the debug of system freeze, which the new diskdump does not address (was not meant to though).<p>Does anyone of the readers heard about such a tool?

      Yes, a very good feature that enable you to make the dump eaiser to understand. <br>
The best thing is that you could save the core dump in another partition, which is usefull if you are debuging disk i/o.<br>

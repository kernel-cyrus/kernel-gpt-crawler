<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2017">2017 Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
The tracking of kernel regressions was <a
href="/Articles/737666/">discussed at the 2017 Kernel Summit</a>; the topic
made a second appearance at the first-ever Maintainers Summit two days
later.  This session was partly a repeat of what came before for the
benefit of those (including Linus Torvalds) who weren't at the first
discussion, but some new ground was covered as well.
<p>
Thorsten Leemhuis started with a reprise of the Kernel Summit discussion,
noting that he has been doing regression tracking for the last year and has
found it to be rather harder than he had expected.  The core of the
problem, he said, is that nobody tells him anything about outstanding
regressions or the progress that has been made in fixing them, forcing him
to dig through the lists to discover that information on his own.  He had,
though, come to a few conclusions on how he wants to proceed.
<p>
First, he will try again to establish the use of special tags to identify
regressions.  His first attempt had failed to gain traction, but he agreed
that he perhaps had not tried hard enough to publicize the scheme and get
developers to use it.  He will be looking into using the kernel Bugzilla
again, even though it still seems like unpleasant work to him.  He'll try
to improve the documentation of how regressions should be tracked and

<a href="/Articles/738220/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/osse/ThorstenLeemhuis2-sm.jpg" alt="[Thorsten
Leemhuis]" title="Thorsten Leemhuis" class="rthumb"></a>

handled.  There is a plan to create a new mailing list on vger.kernel.org,
with the idea that regression reports would be copied there.  He will put
more effort into poking maintainers about open regressions.
<p>
The discussion quickly turned to the problem (as seen by some) of the many
kernel subsystems that do not use the kernel.org Bugzilla instance for
tracking bugs.  Peter Anvin said that many developers don't see much value
in that system.  Reported bugs tend to say something like "my laptop doesn't
boot" with no further information; that tends not to be useful for the
identification of any actual bugs.  Beyond that, many bugs reported against
the core kernel or x86 architecture turn out to be driver bugs in the end.
<p>
Users, it was suggested, should be explicitly directed to the mailing lists
when reporting bugs for the subsystems that do not use Bugzilla.  Laura
Abbott said that this would be just a beginning; the kernel is lacking more
general guidance on where and how to report bugs.  Ted Ts'o, though,
suggested that many kernel developers like the current system, which tends
to filter out reports from relatively non-technical users who are unable to
create useful reports.  It could be seen as a feature, he said; perhaps
such users would be better directed to distributor bug trackers.
<p>
One ongoing problem is that many of the less technical users are unable to
build their own kernel to test a patch intended to fix their problem.  Ben
Herrenschmidt said there might be value in a facility that would
automatically generate a package containing a distribution kernel with a
patch added.  But Greg Kroah-Hartman said that this discussion (as a whole)
had come up many times before.  Before creating elaborate systems, it might
be best to create a better landing page on the kernel Bugzilla to help
users report their bugs.  Arnd Bergmann said that this landing page could
perhaps be a wiki so that maintainers could easily add information on how
to report bugs in 
their own subsystems.  Takashi Iwai suggested that more subsystems should
use Bugzilla; it can host useful materials like screenshots that are not
really suitable for the mailing lists, but Kroah-Hartman said that those
subsystems have managed without Bugzilla so far.
<p>
As in the previous session on this topic, it was noted that the
linux-kernel mailing list is a black hole; reports sent there without
copies to the relevant maintainers are likely to go unread.  Once again, it
was suggested that a bot should be set up to reply to such postings with
suggestions on how to reach an actual human.  Another echo from that
session was the notion that some subsystem maintainers are resistant to
having their bugs called "regressions", since it requires them to respond
to them more quickly.  Linus Torvalds said that he should be told about any
such maintainers, who would then be able to expect a strongly worded
message from him.  Chris Mason, instead, said that some maintainers like to
tag problems as regressions, since regressions are a ticket to get patches
into a late -rc kernel release.
<p>
Torvalds said that the problem that led to Rafael Wysocki ceasing his
regression-tracking work was that he was the only one doing it.  Leemhuis,
too, is doing this job on his own, and it's a grind.  There's only so much
help that can be had from more scripting and documentation, what really
needs to happen is that more people need to be involved in tracking
regressions.  In that regard, the Bugzilla is useful because it helps
people to work together, even though it is "hell" in general.
<p>
The session wound down with a couple of brief side discussions.  Many
regressions in the kernel are related to specific hardware, which makes
them hard to write tests for.  Dan Williams said that, using mocking, unit
tests can be created to enable at least partial testing for drivers.
Finally, it was noted that it would be useful to know which subsystems, in
particular, have been prone to regressions; that could help identify parts
of the kernel that could use some refactoring, better self tests, or
changes in maintenance style.  At the moment, nobody really knows which
subsystems those are.

Would be good to get replies from those involved, but I suspect it’s just a general reflection of how much more work a formal tracker of any kind is than informal tracking.  Mailing list bug discussions are potentially lossy and don’t scale well to tracking lots of issues at once, but by God, they are low overhead...<br>

I get the impression that in many cases people end up complaining about "Bugzilla" when in the end what they actually have issues with is the kind of bug reports other people file and the general "problem" of actually having a searchable database of what people reported, which isn't as easy to ignore as old emails on a list - it's less the specific tool than the fact that there is a tool at all. And of course, if nobody looks at the reports in the tool, they stack up.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; What's so hellish about Bugzilla?</font><br>
<p>
It depends...  I use bugzilla as part of my employment at SUSE and in that context your description:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's not the ideal bug tracking system, but it's not the worst either.</font><br>
<p>
is spot-on.  I don't love it, but it gets the job done.<br>
Part of the reason is that I can trust bug reporters to respond and to follow the process - they are usually L2 or L3 support people and they know the ropes.  Their job requires them to use it just as mine does, so we make it work.<br>
If something gets assigned to me when I don't think it should (which is rare, but happens), there is clear process to reassign it to a group that does triage, and I know there is someone there who will (eventually) look and reassign elsewhere based on details I provided.<br>
If I need to include someone else in the conversation, I can do that because I know all relevant SUSE engineers are registered with bugzilla and can be expected to respond.<br>
<p>
As revised packages move through the system, notes appear in the bugzilla to confirm that, so there is integration with other processes.  There are possibly improvements that could happen there, but in general the integration is good and we do have a strong policy of using the bug number to track things.  Having policy like that helps a lot.<br>
<p>
I've occasionally responded to bugzilla.kernel.org and it isn't too painful, but it is not my preferred approach.<br>
The integration isn't there.  The knowledge that other players have a commitment isn't there.  But mostly, for me, is the fact that the community isn't there.<br>
On the linux-raid and linux-nfs email lists (the main places I contribute) I know there is a community watching and participating to some degree.  We can discuss a bug as a group.  Different people can take the initiative at different times depending on availability and interest.  People come and go freely.  And (I hope) there are people watching and learning.  Certainly there are easily searchable archives for people to search and find old discussions when something becomes relevant.<br>
bugzilla doesn't feel like a community to me. It feels like a silo.  So I'm not particularly interested in working with bugzilla as part of my community involvement.<br>

<p>
Does it?  Are regressions really more urgent than non-regressions? Shouldn't all bugs be fixed quickly?<br>
Regressions can be avoided by going back to an old kernel (even if that should be a last resort).<br>
Non-regressions cannot.<br>
Suppose I buy new hardware, and now the same setup I had before doesn't work.  Is that a regression?  It is for me.<br>
(Anecdote:  Most md arrays require the chunk size to be at least PAGE_SIZE.  On x86, this is always (I think) 4K.  One powerpc64, it can be 64K (other hardware allows 64K and other sizes too).  I recently got a report of an apparent regression because a particular test suite that had been working for years had stopped working.  The problem was it created a RAID10 with 32K chunks (I think) and ppc64 didn't like that.  I don't know if the ppc64 hardware was new, or the config had been changed to use a larger page size, but it hardly matters.<br>
Was this a regression?  Does that label really matter all that much once you admit there is a bug?)<br>

Thanks.  I'm sure I've read that before...  I only find it mildly convincing.<br>
Certainly regressions are important, but so are bug that aren't known to be regressions.<br>
It doesn't really matter how old a bug is: If I hadn't noticed it before and I do now, then that looks like a regression to me.<br>
Maybe I'm looking at this from an overly technical perspective and missing some aspect of the social perspective.<br>

I think an important difference is who discovers the bug and how they can react to it.<br>
<p>
If a feature or API etc has always been buggy, then it seems quite likely the bug will first be encountered by an application developer who's writing their own code to use that feature. That developer is in a good position to debug it - they know what they expect to happen, they see what actually happens, they know their code worked fine immediately before they started using that specific feature. They can probably report the bug, provide a test case, and then find a workaround to let them carry on with their original work. It's a bit annoying but not a big deal; it's not much worse than if that feature never existed.<br>
<p>
If a bug is a regression, it's quite likely it will first be encountered by a user who updates their kernel and finds an application stops working. They aren't developers so they have no idea how to investigate the problem. If you're lucky they might report it to the application developer (assuming the application is still being actively maintained), who might eventually get enough bug reports to realise they're all failing on the same new kernel version. Then the developer can hopefully reproduce and debug it, and tell users the only immediate workaround is to downgrade their kernel (incidentally losing any security fixes from the newer kernel), and try to get it fixed urgently in the next kernel version. Maybe the developer can find a workaround in their application, though that's difficult if they have written a load of code that depends heavily on that now-broken feature, and it might take weeks to deploy an update to users anyway. So the regression is likely to cause serious problems for many people for a long period of time.<br>
<p>
(I experienced that once while developing some game, when a new patch in kernel 2.6.38.2 completely broke glibc's AIO interface. A couple of new users on bleeding-edge distros reported the game was crashing, then an old user reported that it previously worked but just started crashing, and eventually we realised the kernel version was the common factor. It had already been fixed upstream, but the fixed kernel wasn't available to users for weeks, and the only application-level workaround was to disable AIO entirely (which fortunately was easy since we already had a non-AIO code path).)<br>

Does it?  It is true that new code can trigger previously unnoticed bugs, but it is also true the changes to load and changes to jobs mix can trigger previously unnoticed bugs.  And sometimes it is just "bad luck" that triggers a bug that hasn't been noticed before.<br>
I certainly get bug reports from customers that turn out to have been around for a while (as well as regression bugs of course).<br>

Yes.  So much yes!  If the reporter is polite and helpful, they get helped.  If the reported is obnoxious and demanding, they get ignored.  If the reporter is willing to perform a git-bisect, you give them step by step instructions and help them through it.  If the reporter demands a fix, you give them a quote and request payment in advance (or just ignore them).<br>
If a bug report includes the information "this worked on kernel X but doesn't on kernel Y", that is already a sign of a helpful reporter worth responding to - not because it is a regression but because it is reported as a regression.<br>

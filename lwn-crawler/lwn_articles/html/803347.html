Steven Rostedt has been a part of the Linux kernel tracing community for
most of its existence, it seems.  He was the developer of <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt">ftrace</a>,
which was one of the early mainline additions for tracing.  There are now
many tracing facilities in the kernel.  At the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">2019
Open Source Summit Europe</a> in Lyon, France, Rostedt wanted to present an idea
that he has been thinking about for a long time: a unified tracing platform
to provide access to all of the kernel tracing facilities from user-space applications.   
</p>

<p>
There are "many faces of tracing" for Linux, including <a
href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>, <a
href="https://lttng.org">LTTng</a>, 
<a href="https://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</a>, <a
href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/">DTrace</a>, <a
href="/Articles/740157/">BPF</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/ktap/ktap">ktap</a>, <a
href="https://strace.io">strace</a>, <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>, ftrace, and "there's
plenty more", he said.  He began his presentation with a look at the history of
Linux tracing, 
touching on a number of those projects.

<h4>Tracing history</h4>

<p>
Ftrace actually started back when Rostedt was working on his Master's thesis
in 1998.  He created "logdev" to print messages to a ring buffer in a way that was
faster than <tt>printk()</tt>.  He was investigating network quality of
service (QoS) behavior and <tt>printk()</tt> was simply too slow.  He got a
job at Timesys after that and needed a faster way to get information out of
that company's realtime kernel; he was easily able to get logdev working
on that kernel.  His first version of logdev was for the 2.0 kernel; he
ported it to
2.2, 2.4, and so on as they became available.  He actually used logdev to
debug ftrace as he was developing it; logdev is one of the two parents of ftrace.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The realtime patch set had a latency tracer that is the other parent.  It
was created in 2004 by Ingo Molnar and Nadia Chambers.  The latency
tracer used a GCC 
profiling feature that would call an <tt>mcount()</tt> routine at the
beginning of every function, which could be used to trace the execution of
the kernel.  The latency tracer was not dynamic, as function tracing could
not be controlled at runtime; it was either compiled in or not.
</p>

<p>
In 2008, Rostedt was at Red Hat on the realtime team, which was working
on getting the realtime patches upstream.  Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo tried
to port the latency tracer to the upstream kernel, but the tracer was quite
complex and hard to follow; it called <tt>trace()</tt>, which called
<tt>_trace()</tt> and so on up to <tt>_____trace()</tt> (five
underscores).  Rostedt was familiar with the code, so he cleaned it up,
overhauled the latency tracer to use logdev, and turned all of that into ftrace.
</p>

<p>
Next came perf, which started as a "profiling utility done correctly"; it came out of
the flame wars that surrounded oprofile and other profiling solutions, he said.
In addition to profiling, perf had some tracing features that it got by
hooking into the ftrace infrastructure.  Molnar wanted Rostedt to stop
developing ftrace and to move all of that effort into perf, but Rostedt
resisted that push in part because he wanted to keep ftrace's debugfs
interface.  No user-space tool was needed to use ftrace via debugfs, which
made it useful for embedded Linux systems that did not have build tools;
just using <tt>echo</tt> from BusyBox was enough to enable tracing and
a simple <tt>cat</tt> could show the tracing results.
</p>

<p>
Before LTTng, there was the Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT) that was created around
2000 by Karim Yaghmour.  It was the first real attempt to get a tracing
solution into the mainline, but it ran aground on objections from Molnar
and Linus Torvalds.
</p>

<p>
The "next generation" (ng) of LTT was actually a complete rewrite done by
Mathieu Desnoyers in 2006.  Rostedt noted that Desnoyers has said that it
was a mistake 
to keep LTT in the name since it shared little with that code base and was
confusing to those who thought it was simply an extension of LTT.  While
LTTng never made it upstream and has been maintained over the years as an
out-of-tree patch set, Desnoyers was able to get tracepoints into the
mainline; the trace events used by ftrace are built on top of tracepoints.
</p>

<p>
DTrace was the one of the first tracing tools to allow scripting in the kernel.  It was
originally for Solaris and was officially released in 2005.  After Oracle
acquired Sun, the company ported DTrace to Linux, but did not make it available
under the GPL until 2017.  That was too late for most, so DTrace is only
available on Oracle Linux (and perhaps a few others).  It is interesting to
note that some say DTrace came from IBM's dprobe work, which was much
earlier and shipped
with SUSE 
Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) kernels at that time, Rostedt said.
Everyone builds on each others' work in the grand tradition of "on the shoulders
of giants".
</p>

<p>
Red Hat's answer to DTrace was SystemTap, which was released in 2009.  Like
some of the other solutions, it never made it into the mainline kernel.
Part of the problem with getting SystemTap, LTTng, and others upstream is
that those projects focused on the tracer side but never sold other
developers on the usefulness of those tools.
</p>

<p>
Ftrace was not written as a
tracing tool, per se, but it was part of the effort to get the realtime
patches upstream, which needed the ftrace facilities for specific
purposes.  He worked with Desnoyers to get tracepoints into the kernel,
then started making it easy for other developers to add trace events to
their subsystems.  The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc2/source/include/linux/tracepoint.h">macros
used to create trace events</a> are horrifying to 
look at but easy to use.  So ftrace got its foot in the door, then
expanded as other kernel developers started to see its utility.  Now there
are over 1000 trace events in the mainline kernel.
</p>

<p>
A developer could simply define a trace event using the macro and it would
appear in the tracefs hierarchy.  A simple <tt>echo&nbsp;1</tt> into that
file would enable the event, which would start showing up in the tracing
output.  Once kernel developers realized how easy it was, they started being much more
interested in tracing and wanted to see more tracing features added.  At
the 2008 Kernel Summit, Torvalds <a href="/Articles/298685/">proclaimed</a>
that SystemTap was far too 
complicated and that the simple tracing tools already in the kernel should
be expanded further instead.  Simplicity was the goal of the early tools, Rostedt said.
</p>

<p>
Then came BPF.  A just-in-time (JIT) compiler was added for BPF on x86 in
2011, which made customized network-packet filtering extremely fast.  In
2014,  Alexei Starovoitov  introduced extended BPF (eBPF) that allowed BPF
programs to be applied to other areas of the kernel, including tracing.
Tracing with eBPF provides Linux with the capabilities that DTrace and
SystemTap were targeting.  And now, both DTrace and SystemTap are being
reworked to use eBPF under the covers so that existing scripts for those
tools will function on mainline kernels.
</p>

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>
He referred to a 2017 <a
href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/881003937750544384">tweet from Julia
Evans</a> that described the state of tracing on Linux, which she turned
into a lengthy <a
href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/07/05/linux-tracing-systems/">blog
post</a>; all of that information is still pretty accurate today, Rostedt
said.  He is often asked "why can't we have just one tracer?"  Some people
seem to think that too much choice is a problem but his suggestion for those
people is a switch to macOS
</p>

<p>
Part of the complaint about having multiple tracers is that it is splitting
the development effort, but he believes that "diversity brings
innovation".   If the Bell System had not been <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">broken
up</a> back in the 1980s, which brought choice and diversity to the
telephone world, we might still all be using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial">rotary phones</a>—a device
that many don't even recognize today.
</p>

<p>
There is no "one size fits all" in tracing (or much of anything else); he
pointed to "TABs versus spaces" and "Emacs versus Vim" as two classic
examples.  Tracing users often have different objectives.  A dump
truck could be used to travel between cities, but a sports car or motorcycle
might be more appropriate; there are different needs at different times so
it is nice to have a diversity of tools to address them.
</p>

<p>
Some complain that diversity killed Unix, he said; there were too many
flavors of Unix, which led to its demise.  But those Unix flavors were all
proprietary, so they could not share features.  In the proprietary world,
forks are bad, but in the open-source world, forks are good, he said.
Those forks allow people to try things out in different, unexpected ways;
if the outcome is useful, it can folded back into the original.  "Diversity
is the strength of open source", he said, "because we can always share".
</p>

<h4>Commonalities</h4>

<blockquote>
<a href="/Articles/803450/">

alt="[Tracing commonality]" title="Tracing commonality">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are a number of pieces that are shared between the tracers.
Tracepoints are being used by all of the different solutions,  
as are kernel probes (kprobes) and user-space probes (uprobes).  The ftrace
function hooks are also being used by many of the tracers.  He showed the
diagram above (from his <a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osseu19/5f/unified-tracing-platform-oss-eu-2019.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>) to demonstrate the pieces that are shared within the world of
Linux tracers.  The top half, above the dotted line, contains the user-space
pieces, while the lower part has all of the various kernel pieces.
</p>

<p>
His idea is to have a
single user-space library that can be used by all of the different tracers
to interface to all of the different kernel facilities.  It can be seen in
the diagram below as the large green box in user space—with a bit of a typo
in its label.  Effectively, each of the tools would have access to the
capabilities used by the others, so the dump truck, sports car, and
motorcycle of the tracing world can "unleash the power of all the
infrastructure that's in the kernel".
</p>

<blockquote>

<img class="photo" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/osseu-unified-sm.png"
alt="[Unified tracing library]" title="Unified tracing library">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
There has already been some progress in that direction, Rostedt said.   <a
href="https://diamon.org/babeltrace/">Babeltrace</a> is a library that came
out of the LTTng project.  It can convert between multiple different
tracing-file formats and the <a href="https://diamon.org/ctf/">Common Trace
Format</a> (CTF).  The goal is to allow any tracing utility to read and use the
data handled by any other.
</p>

<p>
Another entry is libtraceevent, which is now ready to be packaged and
distributed, Rostedt said; he is looking for distribution package
maintainers to help out with that.  It lives in the kernel source tree (in
<tt>tools/lib/traceevent</tt>).  When raw trace event data is written by
the kernel, the format of that data is also exported in tracefs; that
information is used by perf, <a
href="https://01.org/powertop/">PowerTOP</a>, <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd.1.html">trace-cmd</a>,
and others. All of those tools copied the code that he wrote to parse the
format information and access the data accordingly. He
suggested that those projects copy the code, but now that it
is available in library form, the code copies should be removed in favor of
linking with libtraceevent.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf/lib">libperf</a> library is
available to wrap the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html"><tt>perf_event_open()</tt></a>
system call.  That call is effectively an <tt>ioctl()</tt> with "hundreds
of commands" that is complex to use.  Libperf provides a more sane
interface to <tt>perf_event_open()</tt>.  It is still a new project, but it
will help applications gain access to the power underlying perf.
</p>

<p>
There are also some libraries "coming soon", he said.  Libftrace is an interface to
the tracefs directory; it will allow users to start and stop tracers,
enable and disable events, create kprobes and uprobes, and read the raw
tracing data.  Libtrace-cmd is a higher-level library that will allow other
applications to do anything that trace-cmd can do.  Similarly, libkshark
is a GUI library that gives applications the ability to do anything that <a
href="http://kernelshark.org/Documentation.html">KernelShark</a> does.
That means the capabilities of KernelShark are not limited to only
handling ftrace data; other tracers can use the features of the GUI
tool to work with their own data.
</p>

<p>
That new box in the diagram  would encompass these
libraries and others to 
form a unified tracing platform for Linux.  It would be an abstraction
layer over all of the disparate capabilities that the Linux kernel provides
for tracing.  He suggested that the "Unix way" of "do one thing and do it
well" is evolving into the "Linux way" of "do one library and do it well".
</p>

<p>
The tracing tools are not competing with each other anymore, Rostedt
said.  There were the tracing wars of days gone by, which were good because
they fostered innovation, but there is no reason to keep warring.  The
tracing projects can take the best ideas from each other and meld them
into their tools in various ways, which might lead to electric sports cars,
then electric motorcycles and dump trucks.  He concluded by saying that the
ability to do that kind of thing is what 
makes Linux the best operating system in the world.

I would like to bring a small clarification to this article: LTTng has been an out-of-tree patch set applying on the Linux kernel from 2005 to 2010. Then, when lttng-modules 2.0 was created, the LTTng kernel tracer became a set of kernel modules, which build against vanilla and distribution Linux kernels.<br>
<p>
Therefore, there has been no need to patch the Linux kernel to use lttng-modules since 2010.<br>

Similarly, "Like some of the other solutions, [systemtap] never made it into the mainline kernel." is beside the point, because systemtap was never proposed for inclusion in the mainline kernel.  It has never needed to be there in order to operate.  Given that systemtap can operate in non-LKM-based backends - two of them (BPF and Dyninst) actually - there is now even less reason to pursue such an approach.<br>

In the commonalities diagram, shouldn't there be an arrow from eBPF to perf events? As far as I'm aware eBPF can hook perf events.<br>

It's lovely to see all the tracing work, but please consider that userspace programs are also a crucial data source! SDT probes, DWARF based probing, etc, it's pretty important for performance and troubleshooting work on complex production systems.<br>
<p>
(More on that in my recent comment here: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/803423/">https://lwn.net/Articles/803423/</a>)<br>
<p>
A new, unified tracing library that completely neglects userspace would be most unfortunate. Very few people use a bare kernel to do anything much useful, and most kernel performance work etc is in the end designed to benefit userspace applications.<br>
<p>
Perf, stap, etc all have some common and overlapping needs. They all need to:<br>
<p>
* Track process address space mappings<br>
* find debuginfo for an executable and its loaded libraries<br>
    * at ld.so time<br>
    * at dlopen() time<br>
* Safely and efficiently copy data from program address-space to tracer (char* strings, arbitrary buffers, etc)<br>
* Interpret and query/search DWARF debuginfo<br>
  * look up function entry/exit points, statements, etc<br>
  * look up data types, variable locations, etc<br>
  * traverse data structures<br>
* find/enumerate SDT tracepoints<br>
  * in executables/libraries by full path<br>
  * in executables/libraries on PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH / ld.so.conf<br>
  * by build-id mapping<br>
  * etc<br>
* inject SDT tracepoints (.probes ELF section)<br>
* discover and enumerate traceable locations<br>
* discover and enumerate available args and locals, readable globals, etc<br>
* capture userspace stacks<br>
* annotate userspace stacks with symbolic information<br>
* find and interact with probes exposed by popular non-C runtimes (Java, Python, etc)<br>
<p>
elfutils and libunwind provide some fairly low-level facilities, but it'd be great to see a lot more of this library-ified in a way that can be usefully shared. That way when FooBarTrace44 becomes the new hot thing and everyone loses interest in the "obsolete" eBPF-tools we won't have to start completely from scratch with userspace support .... again.<br>
<p>
It'd also be a nice chance to improve SDT / .probes on Linux, so we can have probes that carry named arguments and argument data types (at least primitive types, char*, and arrays!) rather than the status quo of everything being a "long arg1", "long arg2", etc that you have to cast...<br>

Thanks for writing about this. Great writeup as usual.<br>
<p>
A few points about LTT.<br>
<p>
This is minor, but I first submitted LTT to the lkml in July 1999: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/23/34">https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/23/34</a><br>
<p>
FWIW I couldn't recall Ingo having opposed LTT's inclusion, I had to look that up ;) I certainly remember the "consensus" that I was hearing back from kernel developers was they felt that LTT was a kernel debugging tool and shouldn't therefore be included in the kernel -- so I wouldn't say this is just Ingo and Linus. I do faintly recall that "kernel debugging tool" argument is one I think Linus made to me in person at Usenix 2000 when I first approached him about it, but it's a theme I heard several times over the years despite trying to explain that it was useful for user-space. Some people did get it though, even very early on, as is evident by one of the first replies I got in July 1999 by Werner Almesberger <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/8/7/98">https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/8/7/98</a><br>
<p>
The key sticking point remained the acceptance of trace points into the mainline. A really big kudos goes to Mathieu for getting that in there. Personally I gave up after about 7 years of trying to get trace points included. The following is one of the last things I sent on lkml on this topic: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/17/17">https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/17/17</a><br>

Hi Karim,<br>
<p>
Considering that I started my talk at the Detroit airport lounge on my way to Lyon, I tried hard to find the exact dates things were released. I saw what looked like the first "official" announcement in 2000, thus I said "around 2000". Which wasn't really incorrect. I tried to be as honest and non-bias as possible in my talk, but still stress all the old "fights" we had, and say I think it's time we all work together.<br>
<p>
If there's anything incorrect that I said or showed, I do apologize. It was unintended. I think you know me well enough to know what I was trying to do ;-)<br>
<p>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
No, no, ... no need to apologize in any way, this is great. Consider this nitpicking on my part. I wasn't faulting anyone, and certainly not your initiative in trying to unify things. I was reading this writeup and thought I'd add some details.<br>
<p>
All that being said I wish I had attended your talk. This is a very valuable exercise. And, yes, you have my absolute trust on this; none of my feedback was meant to undermine that.<br>

      I'd like to point out that the link to libperf points to the original GitHub project, but the last commit there is 5 years old. Libperf currently lives in the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf/lib">Linux  kernel tree</a>, along with perf itself.

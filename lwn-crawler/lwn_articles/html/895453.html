           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
The final session in the memory-management track at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM) was run remotely
by James Gowans and David Woodhouse.  It was titled "user-space control of
memory mappings", with a subtitle of "letting guest memory and state
survive kexec".  Some options were discussed, but the real work is clearly
yet to be done.
<p>
The use case in question, Gowans began, is a live update of a hypervisor
done with the kernel's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec</a> functionality.  To
carry this out, the state 
of all running virtual machines is serialized to persistent storage, then
kexec is used to boot into the updated hypervisor.  After that, the virtual
machines can all be restarted.  The desire is to preserve the state of
guest memory over the reboot, which means this memory cannot be managed by
the host kernel in 
the traditional way; instead, the kernel should stay away from that memory
and let user space manage its allocation to virtual machines.  They have
been looking at "sidecar virtual machines" 
as a way to implement this functionality.
<p>
Most of guest memory, Gowans said, should not be touched by the new kernel,
meaning 
that the kernel will only manage a small part of the memory given to guest
systems.  The
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
system call is used to manage the rest; this is a change, since
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> only works with anonymous memory currently.  Future
requirements will include keeping I/O memory-management unit (IOMMU)
mappings in sync, keeping DMA operations running while the update happens,
and improving the speed of kexec by passing more state to the new kernel.
<p>
John Hubbard asked if memory managed in this way needs to have associated
<tt>page</tt> structures; the answer was that they are not needed.
<p>
A few implementation options were presented.  The first was a full
filesystem, implemented in the kernel, that is used to manage allocations
of reserved ranges of memory.  The kernel would reconstruct this filesystem
after a kexec.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1617140178-8773-1-git-send-email-anthony.yznaga@oracle.com/">PKRAM
mechanism</a>, which preserves RAM contents over a kexec, would probably be
used for this purpose; the PKRAM patches were posted last year, but have
not been merged.  How to handle other types of memory, such as PCI
memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) registers, is an open question as well.
<p>
The next implementation option was a FUSE-based filesystem; mapping of
guest memory to page-frame numbers could then be handled from user space.  A
special control process could handle many of the details, and this solution
would support mapping to PCI MMIO spaces.
<p>
Finally, this feature could be implemented using a raw memory device,
something along the lines of <tt>/dev/mem</tt>.  The control process could
use <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls to create and revoke mappings to pages in the
guest process.  User space would be charged with keeping mappings in place
over the kexec call.  There is evidently an implementation of this option
running now.
<p>
Jan Kara observed that there are a number of other things that need to be
restored after a kexec, including open files and more.  This task resembles
<a href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">Checkpoint/Restore in User space</a>
(CRIU), which already exists.  The response was that this solution does not
try to recreate everything automatically; instead, hypervisor processes
will be responsible for opening files again after the kexec.  Woodhouse
compared it to live migration to the same host.  Gowans said that guests
won't notice this happening; they will be paused and serialized, and their
previous state pushed back into KVM by the new hypervisor.
<p>
Returning to the implementation options, Gowans said that the
full-filesystem approach offers the best latency and introspection, but
it's not clear how MMIO regions can be handled.  The FUSE approach gives
full control to user space and solves the MMIO problem.  The raw-memory
version is the most flexible, but it requires reconstructing everything
after the kexec, and is the least transparent to introspection.
<p>
Next steps include figuring out how to handle IOMMU mappings, then picking
an approach to pursue.  The preferred approach looks like the FUSE version,
so the plan is to put together an RFC patch implementing it and to have a
polished version by the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kvm-forum/">KVM Forum</a> in
September.
<p>
Dan Williams said that the FUSE and raw-memory options look like the least
scary ones.  That said, PKRAM <i>does</i> look scary; he asked about the
status of those patches.  David Hildenbrand answered that the last posting
of that work "didn't inspire joy".
<p>
The attendees were tired and the session wound down fairly quickly.  The
final question had to do with the existence of other use cases for this
functionality.  Hildenbrand suggested that databases could be a candidate.
Specifically, huge, in-memory databases can take hours to boot and load up
all of the data; a mechanism like this could possibly accelerate the
process.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Reminds me a bit of the problem of preserving userspace across reboots of a microkernel.<br>
<p>
The solution tends to look a lot like a filesystem. When a computer is rebooted, contents on disk are still there and are rediscovered by the new instance of the filesystem driver. So, extend that metaphor to memory, where the &quot;files&quot; and &quot;directories&quot; are old processes and memory mappings. Page tables &lt;-&gt; filesystem trees.<br>
<p>
Of course, there are some details like making sure the previous version&#x27;s mappings can be updated to reflect a new &quot;on disk format&quot; and that calls to now-nonexistant system calls can be handled appropriately. Also that some ram is available for the new kernel to set itself up before walking the old page and process tables.<br>
<p>
The beauty of a microkernel is that the userspace drivers probably still remember the state of hardware devices, even after the microkernel itself is rebooted.<br>

That saves it to disk, so I guess you could fetch it from the filesystem after rebooting, but the point is really to leave processes in memory and largely unmolested while the OS reboots around them.<br>

Yes. Processes have lots of kernel state that&#x27;s not easily retained across reboots. That&#x27;s basically what checkpoint/restore solves.<br>
If you don&#x27;t want to access the disk, then the only additional thing needed would be a ramdisk that survives reboots where the checkpoints are stored. Such a ramdisk sounds way easier to implement than reinventing checkpoint/restore just for the kexec case.<br>

checkpoint and restore means a ton of copying application data around and packing and unpacking. But I guess you have to do it at all before you can do it zero-copy.<br>

That actually sounds a lot like a big use case for the whole NVDIMM stuff that has been appearing lately.  Faster than disk, not as fast as memory but it&#x27;s also made to persist between reboots, power offs, etc.<br>

The extreme example is one where the OS can replace itself while userspace continues on running CPU-bound load. Having the microkernel replace itself and pick back up without any downtime at all, unless perhaps a program tries to make a call.<br>
<p>
Dunno that it would be possible on current hardware though, with existing interrupt controllers and memory paging.<br>

and the OS was just another replaceable component same as ...<br>

Perhaps, but we stopped building anything to support that *in the 80&#x27;s.* All the Dell and HP and Supermicro boxes are glorified PCs.<br>
<p>
At the same time, the only reason that was possible was because of virtualization. All the &quot;OSs&quot; were running in logical partitions aka hardware VMs. If you lost the hypervisor then the system went down, and the base hypervisor firmware was impossible to replace (often because it&#x27;s in ROM).<br>

Well, yes there was a lot of - not exactly custom - hardware in there, but I guess to upgrade the hypervisor they could quite possibly just have replaced the CPU boards. I don&#x27;t remember any reference to rom-based hypervisors, though ...<br>

From what I recall, the LPARS on IBM or domains on Sun SPARC were managed by firmware loaded from the system board itself, into either a main CPU or a service processor.<br>

Oh this looks really interesting! Sounds like it&#x27;d allow one to Ship-of-Theseus update a single system with minimal service interruption. If it works well enough, maybe it could be extended to the host kernel&#x27;s page cache too?<br>

Indeed, very interesting! Is there a recording of the session?<br>
<p>
It reminded me about this work from Pasha Tatashin: <a href="https://lpc.events/event/11/contributions/1078/">https://lpc.events/event/11/contributions/1078/</a><br>
I couldn&#x27;t find patches though...<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 13, 2011</br>

The security problems at kernel.org have raised concerns about the kernel
source and other software hosted there.  There has been no evidence, so
far, that kernel.org was used to distribute any corrupted software.   But
there is another aspect 
to this breakin: kernel.org is "down for maintenance" and there is no word
as to when it might come back.  As a result, even if no malware was
distributed, the kernel.org crack represents a denial of service attack of
significant proportions.
<p>
Linus has released two 3.1-rc versions from a temporary site at Github, but
there's not a lot of work to be found there.  Among other
things, the loss of all the repositories hosted on kernel.org means that
there is relatively little for him to pull.  Stephen Rothwell, meanwhile,
continues to pull the trees he can reach to create linux-next.  He is able
to report integration and build problems, but <a
href="/Articles/458812/">cannot put the tree</a> where others can reach it.
"<q>Besides, I am having a nice restful time.</q>" There have been no
stable tree updates since kernel.org went down.


<p>
Alternative trees are beginning to pop up across the net as developers find
other places to host their work for now.  If the kernel.org outage
continues for some time, we can expect to see many more of those show up -
though some developers <a href="/Articles/458914/">are refusing</a> to set
up alternative repositories.
Most of the substitute trees are described as temporary; it will be
interesting to see how many of them actually move back to kernel.org once
this episode has run its course.  Some developers may decide that keeping
their trees elsewhere works better for them.
We may have a distributed source control system, but it has become clear
that the kernel community works with a rather centralized hosting and distribution
infrastructure.  
<p>
The loss of kernel.org has slowed things enough to make it
clear that the process has a single point of failure built into it.
Whether that is worth fixing is not entirely clear; no code should have
been lost and, if kernel.org were ever to disappear permanently, the
process could be back to full speed on other systems in short order.  For
now, though, we're seeing things disrupted in a way few other events have
been able to manage.  It's interesting to ponder on what would have
happened had the compromise come out during the merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Don't be so hard !<br>
kernel.org has been up and running for over 10 years or so no?<br>
So, with a rough 10 days downtime, that's (1-10/3650) = 99,7% availability in presence of malicious faults.<br>
OK, that figure is going to drop until the site comes up again but, well... I wish other sites had the same result personnally; and the figure will start to go up again as soon as the site comes back online.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, 100% availability did not look serious. Enjoy the holiday while that security benchmark finally gets a true run.<br>

This "holiday" occurs just as students in the U.S. are preparing to return to college.  I had planned to fix a suspend/resume bug on my daughter's laptop, but I cannot access the necessary patches.  Now she'll have to live with the problem until the real holidays come this winter.<br>

      <p>Just think of it as an opportunity for your daughter to learn how to compile and install her own kernel instead of depending on you to do it.  If the bug is a real pain, it may even provide her with some needed motivation.

I usually follow the git stable trees for my workstation's kernel and I had to resort to manually patching a checkout of the 3.0 tag from linus's gitorious. Worked, but it would be nice if there was a stable kernel git somewhere....<br>

Didn't our Dear Editor's blog entry on linux.com say something like "kernel.org may appear to be a hub of development, but it is really more of a hub of distribution."? I can't double-check because linux.com is down due to being compromised...<br>

That is how I thought it worked, too.  Unfortunately, bugzilla.kernel.org, wiki.kernel.org, and stable@kernel.org are all very useful for development and all down with no fallback I know of.<br>

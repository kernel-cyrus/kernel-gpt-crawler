<h1>Finding buffer overflows with Parfait</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>July 29, 2009</br>
           </div>
<p>
Recently, Roel Kluin has been proposing patches to fix a number of buffer
overflows in the kernel, some of which he credited to "Parfait".  It turns
out that <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/parfait/">Parfait</a> is
a static source code checking tool that comes out of Sun Labs in
Australia.  The project reported 54 buffer overflows to the linux-security
mailing list in early July, and Kluin has been going through them to get
them fixed.
</p>

<p>
It is best to treat buffer overflows as potential security vulnerabilities,
even though they may be hard&mdash;or impossible&mdash;to exploit.  Various
types of these bugs have been thought to be unexploitable along the way,
but then were found to be exploitable, so caution is clearly
indicated.  The full list was sent to the private kernel security alias,
and then passed along to Kluin by Andrew Morton.  Kluin has then been
posting patches to linux-kernel, as well as the netdev mailing list, to fix
them.  A number of the fixes have already been picked up by subsystem
maintainers, and some have made their way into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
The tool itself is relatively new, first demonstrated as an alpha last
October, and takes a multi-layered approach using an "ensemble" of
static analysis techniques.  Thus the name.  One of the goals, from the
outset, was to produce something that could analyze a huge
codebase&mdash;the OpenSolaris or Linux kernel for example&mdash;in a
matter of minutes rather than the days or weeks that other tools require.

<p>
As part of a <a
href="http://research.sun.com/projects/downunder/publications/documents/kca09.pdf">paper
[PDF]</a> presented at the Kernel Conference Australia in mid-July, the
Parfait developers reported checking 5.7 million lines of code in the
2.6.29 kernel for buffer overflows in 13 minutes.  The times for
OpenSolaris and OpenBSD were similar when scaled for the number of lines of
code checked.
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, for all three kernels, the majority of buffer overflows
were found in the driver code.  For 2.6.29, Parfait found 12 buffer
overflows in the Linux core, and 85 in the drivers (which makes up 71% of
the codebase).  Some of those were false positives, but the paper does not
make it clear just how many.  Given that 54 were reported to
linux-security, though, it would seem that something approaching half were
false positives.
</p>

<p>
Kluin provided an example of the Parfait output:
<pre>
    Bug type: Buffer overflow
    File: /usr/src/linux-2.6.29/security/smack/smackfs.c
    Line: 777
    Function: smk_write_netlbladdr
    Code snippet:

    0772:   if (count < SMK_NETLBLADDRMIN || count > SMK_NETLBLADDRMAX)
    0773:           return -EINVAL;
    0774:   if (copy_from_user(data, buf, count) != 0)
    0775:           return -EFAULT;
    0776:
    0777:   data[count] = '\0';
    0778:
    0779:   rc = sscanf(data, "%hhd.%hhd.%hhd.%hhd/%d %s",
    0780:           &amp;host[0], &amp;host[1], &amp;host[2], &amp;host[3], &amp;m, smack);
    0781:   if (rc != 6) {
    0782:           rc = sscanf(data, "%hhd.%hhd.%hhd.%hhd %s",

    Parfait report:
    Error: Buffer overflow at
    /usr/src/linux-2.6.29/security/smack/smackfs.c:777 in function
    'smk_write_netlbladdr' [Symbolic analysis]
	  In array dereference of data[count] with index 'count'
	  Array size is 42 bytes, count >= 9 and count <= 42

    Comments:
    Off-by-one when adding the trailing null on line 777 - data is
    declared with size
    SMK_NETLBLADDRMAX, and count is allowed to equal SMK_NETLBLADDRMAX
</pre>

Which shows a buffer overflow that he had already fixed in the kernel prior
to the Parfait report.  The paper also describes a GUI tool that collects
up the code and declarations that make Parfait believe there is a problem,
which can help developers determine whether there truly is a problem or not. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, Parfait is not available to those outside of Sun, but a binary
release is planned.  According to lead developer Cristina Cifuentes, it
should be available on the web site within the next month or two: "<q>I estimate it will be end of August (to be  
optimistic)
before the binary release is out, a more pessimistic estimate is end of
September.</q>"  That release will be available for "<q>use on a
non-commercial basis</q>", she said.  Sun is considering an open source
release, but no decision on that has yet been made.
</p>


<p>
In an <a href="http://research.sun.com/minds/2009-0512/">interview</a> on
the Sun Labs web site, Cifuentes gives a broader view of where Parfait is
headed&mdash;more than just looking for buffer overflows:
<div class="BigQuote">
At the moment the types of bugs we're finding include other memory-pointer
related bugs. Things like null pointer dereference, double free, use after
free, memory leaks, format string type mismatches &mdash; they can all be found
with similar types of analysis. Those are some that we're
putting our emphasis on now.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In many ways, Parfait is similar to the <a
href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> analysis tool that has been
used on the kernel as well as other free software.  In both cases, at least
for now, the analysis can only be run by the company who owns the tool, or
those who have licensed it in the case of Coverity.  A free software
analysis tool that did these kinds of checks&mdash;and didn't depend on the
goodwill of various companies&mdash;would be a real boon.  With luck, perhaps
Parfait will some day fill that role.
</p>

<p>
These source analysis tools clearly find real bugs, though there is some <a
href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix09/tech/full_papers/guo/guo_html/index.html">evidence</a>
that the bug reports resulting from the scans are not being used to their
fullest.  The Coverity scanner <a
href="http://blog.coverity.com/posts/general/would-you-like-to-know-about-0day-defects-months-in-advance">found</a>
the <tt>tun.c</tt> <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/342330/">NULL pointer 
dereference</a> problem long before it was fixed in the kernel, but the
report either went unnoticed or was (incorrectly as it turns out) not seen
to be a serious problem.  More source code analysis&mdash;at least any that
isn't plagued by too many false positives&mdash;can only be a good thing,
but the problems found need to be addressed or the value of the effort
drops dramatically.  It would be awfully nice to have free versions of
these kinds of tools as well.

I think Coccinelle should be mentioned here. It probably works differently, but it has a good set of semantic patches covering different areas of programming mistakes. It already helped fixing quite a number of bugs in the kernel.<br>

Should also be worthy pointing out that as part of the Clang project, LLVM also has a pretty good static analyzer, which is being actively developed in the open.<br>

False positives are not so bad.  I can go through search through over 100 error messages in an hour.  The next time an RC1 kernel is released I ignore all the messages I checked last time.<br>
<p>
If a tool prints 1000 error messages with a 99% false positive rate it would take me 2 days to find 10 bugs.  Of course, it is dreary work, but the bad guys are willing to do it.<br>
<p>
Blatant Self Promotion:  smatch takes about 4 hours to check a kernel on my eee.  Smatch has an array overflow check but it sucks.  I will improve it to find the bug described in the article.<br>
<p>
Basically, once you understand the possible values of variables it is easy to check for things like this.  Smatch tries to track all the possible values at any point.  Once you have that, looking for bugs is much easier.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 15, 2016</br>
           </div>
<p>

A typical program written in C looks like a deterministic set of
steps laid out in a specific order.  Out of the programmer's sight, though,
both the compiler and the CPU are free to change the ordering of operations
with the goal of speeding the program's execution.  When one is dealing
with a single thread of execution, reordering operations without breaking
the program is a relatively straightforward task; that is no longer true
when multiple threads are working with the same memory.  In the
multi-threaded case, developers must often make the ordering requirements
explicit. 
<p>
To that end, the kernel has
defined a whole set of memory barriers and atomic operations designed to
preserve memory-access ordering in places where it matters while preserving
performance.  The C11 version of the C language tries to solve the same
problems with a different set of barrier operations.  Once again, the
question has been asked: should the kernel drop its own operations in favor
of those defined by the C standard?
<p>
This question last came up in 2014; see <a href="/Articles/586838/">LWN's
coverage of that discussion</a> for a great deal of background on how C11
atomic operations work and how concurrent memory access can go wrong when
reordering of operations is not sufficiently controlled.  This time around,
compiler support for C11 atomic operations has improved, and David Howells
has come forward with <a href="/Articles/687863/">a full implementation</a>
of the (x86) kernel's atomic operations built on C11 atomics.  The
implementation itself is fairly straightforward; for example, the
<tt>atomic_read()</tt> functions look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    static __always_inline int __atomic_read(const atomic_t *v, int memorder)
    {
	return __atomic_load_n(&amp;v-&gt;counter, memorder);
    }
    #define atomic_read(v)		(__atomic_read((v), __ATOMIC_RELAXED))
    #define atomic_read_acquire(v)	(__atomic_read((v), __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE))
</pre>
<p>
David's patches show that this conversion can be done; the real question is
whether it <i>should</i> be done.  As one might expect, there are a number
of arguments each way.
<p>
Switching to C11 atomic operations would, in theory, allow the kernel to
dump a bunch of tricky architecture-specific barrier code and take
advantage of the same code, built into the compiler, that concurrent
user-space programs will be using.  C11 atomics give the compiler better 
visibility into what the code is actually doing, opening up more
optimization possibilities and enabling the use of instructions that are
tricky to invoke from inline assembly code.  The compiler can also pick
the instruction that is appropriate for the size of the operand; that can
eliminate the big compile-time switch statements in the kernel's header
files currently.
<p>
The optimization possibilities are not fully realized with current
compilers, but the potential exists for the compiler to, eventually, do
better than even the most highly tweaked inline assembly code.  As Paul
McKenney <a href="/Articles/691289/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I agree that might be very hard for the C11 intrinsics to beat
	tightly coded asms.  But it might not be all that long before the
	compilers can beat straightforward hand-written assembly.  And the
	compiler might well eventually be able to beat even tightly code
	asms in the more complex cases such as cmpxchg loops.
</div>
<p>
There is also a benefit from the compiler being able to move specific
barriers away from the actual atomic operation if that gives better
performance; such moves are not possible with operations implemented in
inline assembly.
<p>
Of course, there are some disadvantages to making this switch as well.  One
of those is that C11 atomics are not implemented well in anything but the
newest compilers.  Indeed, David says that "<q>there will be some
seriously suboptimal code production before gcc-7.1</q>" — a release
that is not due for the better part of a year.  As might be expected,
numerous bugs involving C11 atomics have been turned up as part of this
project; they are being duly reported and fixed, but there are probably
more to come.  In the long term, use of C11 atomics in the kernel would
certainly lead to a more robust compiler implementation, but getting there
might be painful. 
<p>
If a kernel built for multiprocessor operation (as almost all are) finds
itself running on a uniprocessor system, it will patch the unneeded
synchronization instructions out of its own code.  If C11 atomics are used,
this patching is not possible; it is no longer possible to know where those
instructions are, and even small compiler changes could lead to massive
confusion.  Uniprocessor systems are increasingly rare and, arguably,
custom kernels are already built for many of them, but it would still be
better not to slow down such systems unnecessarily.
<p>
Perhaps the biggest potential problem, though, is that the memory model
implemented by C11 atomics does not exactly match the model used by the
kernel.  The C11 model is based on acquire/release semantics — one-way
barriers that are described in the 2014 article and <a
href="/Articles/576486/">this article</a>.  Much of the kernel, instead,
makes use of load/store barriers, which are stricter, two-way barriers.
A memory write with release semantics will only complete after any previous
reads or writes are visible throughout the system, but it allows other
operations made logically after the write to be reordered to happen before
that write.  A write with store semantics, instead, strictly orders other
write operations on both sides of the barrier.
<p>
One option would be to weaken the kernel's memory model so that
architectures that have acquire/release semantics can gain the associated
performance advantages.  But, as one might imagine, such a change would be
fraught with the potential for subtle, difficult-to-find bugs; it would
have to be approached carefully.  That said, David notes that the PowerPC
seems to already be working with a weaker model, so there may not be many
problems lurking in the core kernel.
<p>
As Will Deacon <a href="/Articles/691295/">pointed out</a>, C11 atomics
lack a good implementation of <a href="/Articles/588300/">consume load
operations</a>, which are an important part of read-copy-update (RCU), among
other things.  A consume load can always be replaced with an acquire
operation, but the performance will be worse.  In general, Will worries
that the C11 model is a poor fit for the ARM architecture, and that the
result of a switch might be an unwieldy combination of C11 and
kernel-specific operations.  He did agree, though, that a generic
implementation based on C11 atomics would be a useful tool for developers
bringing up the kernel on a new architecture.
<p>
There has, thus far, been far less discussion of this idea than happened
last time around; perhaps developers are resigning themselves to the idea
that this change will happen eventually, even if it seems premature now.
There would certainly be advantages in such a switch, for both the kernel
and the compiler communities.  Whether those advantages justify the costs
has not yet been worked out, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>November 25, 2008</br>

<p>
There is a lot of functionality&mdash;things like filesystems and device
drivers&mdash;that are normally considered to be kernel tasks, but have,
over time, been allowed to move into user space.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/232575/">UIO user space driver framework</a>
came along in 2.6.23, while filesystems in user space (FUSE) have been
around since 2.6.14.  Tejun Heo would like to see this idea broadened even
further with the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308112/">character
devices in user space</a> (CUSE) patches.
</p>

<p>
At first blush, the uses for a character device implemented in user space
are not obvious.  Looking a bit deeper, though, one finds numerous
programs&mdash;both open and closed source&mdash;that rely on legacy
character drivers.  Those drivers are currently in the kernel, but need not
be if there were a way to implement them in user space.  In addition,
older, deprecated interfaces, such as Open Sound System (OSS) can be better
supported without constantly fiddling with the in-kernel emulation.
</p>

<p> Providing better OSS support is one of the prime motivators for CUSE as
Heo announced in a linux-kernel <a href="/Articles/308490/">posting</a>
introducing the <a href="http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/ossp/">OSS
proxy</a>.  The proxy uses CUSE to implement the <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>,
<tt>/dev/adsp</tt>, and <tt>/dev/mixer</tt> devices that programs using OSS
expect.  Adrian Bunk didn't necessarily <a href="/Articles/308525/">see
this as a good thing</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote"> Sorry for being
destructive, but 6 years after ALSA went into the kernel we are slightly
approaching the point where all applications support ALSA.  <p> The
application you list on your webpage is UML host sound support, and I'm
wondering why you don't fix that instead of working on a better OSS
emulation?  
</div> 
</p>

<p>
But Heo sees the current state of OSS emulation as a rather complicated
mess that, for better or worse, <a href="/Articles/308531/">needs cleaning
up</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote">
We now have in-kernel OSS emulation which can't mux with other streams,
aoss [ALSA OSS emulation] with its own supported and broken list and can
also be routed 
through PA [PulseAudio] by configuring ALSA right and then padsp [PA OSS
emulation] with its own
supported and broken list and nothing works good enough.  So, if we have
one thing which just works, we can in time put all those to rest.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But there are other uses for CUSE too.  Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/Articles/308550/">notes</a> that legacy 
software for talking to Palm Pilots, much of which is binary-only, expects
to talk to a <tt>/dev/pilot</tt> serial port.  The kernel carries around a
driver, but "<q>a libusb userspace program can handle all of the data to
the USB device instead</q>".  So CUSE could be used to eventually remove
another crufty driver from the kernel, while still maintaining
compatibility with old user space code.
</p>

<p>
CUSE is implemented on top of FUSE as there is a fair amount of overlap
between them.  Character devices and filesystems implement many of the same
file operations&mdash;things like <tt>open()</tt>, <tt>close()</tt>,
<tt>read()</tt>, and <tt>write()</tt>&mdash;which makes them a good match.
Heo has a separate <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308111/">patchset for
FUSE</a> that implements additional operations for filesystems some of
which will be used by CUSE.
</p>

<p>
The additional FUSE operations include an implementation of
<tt>ioctl()</tt> that is necessarily rather ugly.  Because an
<tt>ioctl</tt> implementation can access memory in unpredictable
ways&mdash;and those data structures can be arbitrarily deep&mdash;there
needs to be a mechanism for user-space CUSE devices to read and write that
memory.  The CUSE server does not have direct access to the caller's
memory, so a multi-step
<tt>ioctl()</tt> with retries must be implemented.  This particular bit of
ugliness is only allowed for in-kernel use, so that CUSE (or other
things like it) can allow "unrestricted" <tt>ioctl()</tt> implementations.
All FUSE filesystems are still required to have "restricted"
<tt>ioctls</tt> where the kernel can determine the direction and amount of
data that is transferred.
<tt>poll()</tt> support has also been added to FUSE, which, in turn,
requires a separate patch that allows <tt>poll()</tt> callbacks to sleep
(described in this <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308426/">article</a>).
</p>

<p>
Once the FUSE changes are in place, the actual implementation of CUSE is
relatively small, weighing in around 1000 lines plus some housekeeping to
rename and export FUSE symbols.  At its core, it collects up a FUSE-mounted
filesystem that connects to the user-space implemented device along with
the kernel-exported character device, binding the two together.  FUSE
handles the interaction with the user-space code, in the same way that it
does for a filesystem. 
</p>

<p>
CUSE creates a device for commands, <tt>/dev/cuse</tt>, which is opened by
a program that wants to implement a particular character device.  CUSE
queries the opener to determine which device it is implementing and then
creates the device node.  For most operations, CUSE just hands off to FUSE,
but for <tt>open()</tt> it, instead, opens a file from the FUSE mount,
storing the file handle for use by later operations. 
</p>

<p> In many ways, CUSE is a kind of impedance matching layer that creates
something that acts like a character device, but has no hardware directly
behind it.  This allows CUSE to ignore things like hardware interrupts;
those would need to be handled by something else, typically a downstream
driver&mdash;the soundcard driver in the OSS proxy case.  This is one of
the big differences between UIO and CUSE.  UIO is much more like a regular
kernel device driver that requires kernel code to handle interrupts.  CUSE
drivers, on the other hand, can be created without ever touching kernel
space.  </p>


<p> The only objection so far seems to be Bunk's complaint about supporting
OSS when it has been deprecated for so long.  As Heo points out, though,
there are still many applications that only support OSS.  In addition, all
of the code that has been submitted is "<q>way smaller than the
in-kernel ALSA OSS emulation which is somewhat painful to use these
days</q>", <a href="/Articles/308590/">Heo says</a>.  Since there are
other potential users of CUSE, not just the OSS proxy, it would seem that,
absent any major objections, CUSE could make it into 2.6.29.  </p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

SunRay Server Software could make use of this to create sound device nodes that map to the soundcards of the remote appliances. Last time I checked (two years ago; SRSS 3.0/3.1) it had a kernel module of some sort that just proxied the data back to userspace to send it over the network; now CUSE could do that easily.<br>

With this mechanism, it would be much easier to support network redirected serial ports. Currently, cyclades-serial-client uses LD_PRELOAD, which is far from optimal. <br>

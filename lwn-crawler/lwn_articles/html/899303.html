The CPU scheduler's job has never been easy; it must find a way to allocate
CPU time to all tasks in the system that is fair, allows all tasks to
progress, and maximizes the throughput of the system as a whole.  More
recently, it has been called upon to satisfy another constraint: minimizing
the system's energy consumption.   There is currently <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220621090414.433602-1-vdonnefort@google.com/">a
patch set</a> in circulation, posted by Vincent Donnefort with work from
Dietmar Eggemann as well, that changes how this constraint is met.  The
actual change is small, but it illustrates how hard it can be to get the
needed heuristics right.
<p>
Reduction of energy use is, of course, a worthy goal; energy that is not
wasted becomes available for the mining of more cryptocurrency, after all.
There are some smaller considerations as well, such as environmental benefits,
that justify the effort, but the proliferation of battery-powered devices
has added more urgency to the task.  If batteries can be made to last
longer, doomscrolling interruptions will be fewer and users will be happier.

<p>
These pressures have led to the addition of energy-aware scheduling to the
kernel.  When the scheduler considers the placement of tasks in the system,
it will work to reduce the amount of energy consumed overall; this work
includes running the CPUs at the power level that is the most efficient for
the current load and powering down processors entirely when possible.  For
example, if a CPU that is currently running at a given power level can
accept another task without having to move to a higher power level, it may
make sense to move a task there from another CPU.
<p>
In 2018, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/732cd75b8c92">this patch
from Quentin Perret</a> (which was part of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181203095628.11858-1-quentin.perret@arm.com/">energy-aware
scheduling patch set</a>) added a function called
<tt>find_energy_efficient_cpu()</tt> to the scheduler; its job was to find
the best place (from an energy-consumption point of view) for a given task.
The heuristic used, at its core, is to find the least-busy CPU within each
"performance domain" (cluster of CPUs whose energy usage is tied together)
and estimate the energy cost (or savings) that would result from putting
the task on that CPU.
The least-busy CPU is the most likely to stay in a low-power state, so it
makes a logical target for some extra work.
<p>
There is, however, a cost to moving a task from one CPU to another; that
task may leave some or all of its memory caches behind, which will slow it
down.  That affects performance and is not good for energy use either, so
it should be avoided whenever possible.  As a way of preventing excess task
movement between CPUs, <tt>find_energy_efficient_cpu()</tt> would only move
a task if the result would be a savings of at least 6% of the energy used
by the task's previous CPU.
<p>
The calculation of the best CPU was expensive, though, to the point where
it was adding unwanted latency to scheduling decisions.  So Perret <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/eb92692b2544">reworked it</a> for the
5.4 kernel release in 2019.  The intent was to get the same results for
less CPU cost; the patch changelog said "<q>no functional changes
intended</q>".  It turns out that there was a subtle change, though, that
apparently escaped review: the 6% rule now compared against the energy used by
the entire system, rather than just the previous CPU a task was running on.
That is a relatively 
high bar to movement that, on a system with enough CPUs, could become
impossible for a task to meet.
<p>
Even on smaller systems, the new rule effectively prevents task movement in
many cases.  This is especially true in situations where there are a
relatively large number of small tasks running — a situation that is often
found on Android devices, where energy efficiency is a real concern.  If it
is no longer able to move tasks to save energy, all of the work done by
<tt>find_energy_efficient_cpu()</tt> is wasted and the device runs less
efficiently than it otherwise would.
<p>
An obvious solution would be to undo the 5.4 change to the algorithm but,
Donnefort <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220621090414.433602-8-vdonnefort@google.com/">said</a>,
"<q>the original version didn't have strong grounds either</q>".  Indeed,
there was never any reasoning given for the 6% number, which was 1.5%
until it was raised to 6% in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180628114043.24724-1-quentin.perret%40arm.com/">version&nbsp;4
of the patch set</a>.  Its best feature may
be that it is relatively easy to approximate with a right-shift
operation.  The conclusion Donnefort reached is that it would be better to
simply remove that test entirely and migrate a task whenever it appears that
the move would result in reduced energy consumption.
<p>
According to benchmarks posted with the patch set, the result is indeed
better energy performance — up to a 5.6% reduction on a video benchmark.
CPU performance is reduced slightly in some tests, but the change does not
seem to be significant.  As Donnefort put it:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The margin removal lets the kernel make the best use of the Energy
	Model, tasks are more likely to be placed where they fit and this
	saves a substantial amount of energy, while having a limited impact
	on performance.
</blockquote>
<p>
One possible drawback of this change could be increased bouncing of tasks
between CPUs, but Donnefort said that testing "<q>showed no issue</q>".
<p>
This patch set is in its eleventh revision, having seen a number of changes
in response to review comments.  In response to this version, scheduler
maintainer Peter Zijlstra had <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yrqr84h5xe2GYMVb@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">just
one word</a> to say: "<q>Thanks!</q>".  So it would appear that removal of
the 6% heuristic makes sense, and that it will be finding its way into the
mainline sooner rather than later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

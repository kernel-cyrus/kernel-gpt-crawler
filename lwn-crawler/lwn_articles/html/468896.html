           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 22, 2011</br>
           </div>
Caching plays an important role at almost all levels of a contemporary
operating system.  Without the ability to cache frequently-used objects in
faster memory, performance suffers; the same idea holds whether one is
talking about individual cache lines in the processor's memory cache or
image data cached by a web browser.  But caching requires resources; those
needs must be balanced with other demands on the same resources.  In other
words, sometimes cached data must be dropped; often, overall performance
can be improved if the program doing the caching has a say in what gets
removed from the cache.  A recent patch from John Stultz attempts to make
it easier for applications to offer up caches for reclamation when memory
gets tight.
<p>

John's <a href="/Articles/468837/">patch</a> takes a lot of inspiration
from the <a
href="http://elinux.org/Android_Kernel_Features#ashmem">ashmem</a> device
implemented for Android by Robert Love.  But ashmem functions like a device
and performs its own memory management, which makes it hard to merge upstream.
John's patch, instead, tries to integrate things more deeply into the
kernel's own memory management subsystem.  So it takes the form of a new
set of options to the <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> system call.  In particular,
an application can mark a range of pages in an open file as "volatile" with
the <tt>POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE</tt> operation.  Pages that are so
marked can be discarded by the kernel if memory gets tight.  Crucially,
even dirty pages can be discarded - without writeback - if they have been
marked volatile.  This operation differs from <tt>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED</tt>
in that the given pages will not (normally) be discarded right away - the
application <i>might</i> want the contents of volatile pages in the future,
but it will be able to recover if they disappear.
<p>
If a particular range of pages becomes useful later on, the application
should use the <tt>POSIX_FADV_NONVOLATILE</tt> operation to remove the
"volatile" marking.  The return value from this operation is important: a
non-zero return from
<tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> indicates that the kernel has removed
one or more pages from the indicated range while it was marked volatile.
That is the only indication the application will get that the kernel has
accepted its offer and cleaned out some volatile pages.  If those pages
have not been removed, <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> will return zero and the
cached data will be available to the application.
<p>
There is also a <tt>POSIX_FADV_ISVOLATILE</tt> operation to query whether a
given range has been marked volatile or not.

</blockquote>
<p>
Rik van Riel <a href="/Articles/468902/">raised</a> a couple of questions
about this functionality.  He expressed concern that the kernel might
remove a single page of a multi-page cached object, thus wrecking the
caching while failing to reclaim all of the memory used to cache that
object.  Ashmem apparently does its own memory management partially to
avoid this very situation; when an object's memory is reclaimed, all of it
will be taken back.  John would apparently rather avoid adding another
least-recently-used list to the kernel, but he did respond that it might be
possible to add logic to reclaim an entire volatile range once a single
page is taken from that range.
<p>
Rik also worried about the overhead of this mechanism and proposed an
alternative that he has apparently been thinking about for a while.  In
this scheme, applications would be able to open (and pass to
<tt>poll()</tt>) a special file descriptor that would receive a message
whenever the kernel finds itself short of memory.  Applications would be
expected to respond by freeing whatever memory they can do without.  The
mechanism has a certain kind of simplicity, but could also prove difficult
in real-world use.  When an application gets a "free up some memory"
message, the first thing it will probably need to do is to fault in its
code for handling that message - an action which will require the
allocation of more memory.  Marking the memory ahead of time
and freeing it directly from the kernel may turn out to be a more reliable
approach.
<p>
After the recent <a href="/Articles/465317/">frontswap discussions</a>, it
is perhaps unsurprising that nobody has dared to observe that volatile
memory ranges bear a more than passing resemblance to transcendent memory.
In particular, it looks a lot like "cleancache," which was merged in the
3.0 development cycle.  There are differences: putting a page into
cleancache removes it from normal memory while volatile memory can remain
in place, and cleancache lacks a user-space interface.  But the core idea
is the same: asking the system to hold some memory, but allowing that memory
to be dropped if the need arises.  It could be that the two mechanisms
could be made to work together.
<p>
But, as noted above, nobody has mentioned this idea, and your editor would
certainly not be so daring.
<p>
One other question that has not been discussed is whether this code could
eventually replace ashmem, reducing the differences between the mainline
and the Android kernel.  Any such replacement would not happen anytime
soon; ashmem has its own ABI that will need to be supported by Android
kernels for a long time.  Over years, a transition to
<tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> could possibly be made if the Android developers
were willing to do so.  But first the <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> patch will
need to get into the mainline.  It is a very new patch, so it is hard to
say if or when that might happen.  Its relatively non-intrusive nature and
the clear need for this capability would tend to argue in its favor,
though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<P>Except, of course, in the context of an LWN article.  ;-)</P>
<P>The idea also reminds me a bit of the "swapping in userspace" ideas that <A rel="nofollow" HREF="http://kerneltrap.org/node/4580">GNU Hurd has explored, at least on L4.</A>  IIRC, the Hurd L4 microkernel only deals in physical pages, and can hand physical pages to tasks or ask for physical pages back.  All actual "swapping" decisions get made by the individual user-space tasks themselves.</P>
<P>This does have a certain conceptual nicety to it:  When memory pressure increases, you can run garbage collectors more frequently and drop caches more aggressively.  And each application can choose the strategy that makes the most sense for itself.</P>
<P>The downside, of course, is that it requires perfect cooperation between all processes.  There is no way for the OS to override the decisions of an ill-behaved userspace application, other than to terminate it.</P>
<P>(Note:  I don't know what the current state of the art is in GNU Hurd land.  The article I linked was from 2005.  Then again, Wikipedia suggests that not much has happened since then other than changing microkernels a few times after L4.  I think that adds another twist to the microkernel-vs-monolithic kernel debate, but I don't really feel like going there right now.  ;-) )</P>

      <p>Though the idea of process notifications when the kernel runs low on free pages is a common one, this approach still gives me the willies. Two issues give me pause:
<ul>
<li>
In the general case, processes freeing memory may temporarily use more memory (say, by swapping pages in or allocating file buffers for output) in order to free memory. Marking pages for the kernel to grab without running the process that has them seems much less likely to dead- or livelock.</li>
<li>The reason the kernel is running out of memory may very be due to to a new process grabbing memory as it starts up. Such a process may grab memory a lot faster the clean up process happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rik Van Riel's issue about multipage objects is valid, but having the kernel grab all associated pages addresses that and, I expect, does so in a way that matches the way multi-page objects are likely to be used, so I think this is a moot point.</p>
<p>Looking things from a higher level, though, the two approaches are not exclusive and each has cases where it can do things the other can't.</p>

The statement that Android needs to support an older mechanism for some time is too strong, as an Android version generally is an association between a user and a kernel. It's quite unusual to upgrade the kernel without updating the userland (although the opposite isn't necessarily true). Adding a configuration to the userland build to match it to the kernel should be sufficient to allow a flag day change.<br>

      Close, but no cigar. If you think only about Dalvik, then yes, everything can be emulated. But NDK programs can (and do) use ashmem directly. This means it must be supported for long, long time. No flag day for you :-)

If NDK applications were staticly linked with libcutils and libc, then yes, they won't work. The shared libraries could be changed to emulate the previous behavior, but, admittedly, that's starting to get a bit extreme to change open and ioctl to strip off the ashmem operations and emulate them.<br>
<p>
Changing the ashmem_* API implementation would be the most straightforward, and would address most applications. Those not using the ashmem_* APIs, or using a static library version of libcutils, deserve what they get, particularly taking heed of the NDK warning about which APIs are stable. If an application uses a static library, they should set the maxSdkVersion attribute, as they are likely to get broken in some future release. But, the ashmem APIs will need to be available essentially forever in the library, although the ashmem header file could be removed in future NDK releases, assuming the new service was implemented in the kernel. The user/kernel dependencies are still somewhat nebulous. While ICS devices are generally built with a 3.0 kernel, the emulator still runs under 2.6.39, so the flag day might still take an additional platform release, or the ashwin implementation would need to know the capability of the kernel. The Android ROM hacker community is generally still working with 2.6.36 kernels, particularly for non-OMAP devices.<br>

Overriding this call seems wrong to me. In my opinion a new flag to mmap would work better. Then the entire mmap range could be cleared, fixing the potential problem of losing one page from the middle of an object.<br>

This solution still needs a way for the kernel to let the process know when it's memory was relinquished.<br>
<p>
POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE as a corresponding call for this task and it would be better overall if this lock/unlock||unPOSIX_FADV_VOLATILE/POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE didn't have many options.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; When an application gets a "free up some memory" message, the first thing it will probably need to do is to fault in its code for handling that message - an action which will require the allocation of more memory.</font><br>
<p>
Except for the stack for function calls, that's not necessarily true: the coder know that the goal of the code is to handle 'low memory' condition so a good coder will<br>
a) try to minimize the memory needed for this handling of 'low memory'<br>
b) reserve ahead the memory needed for the task<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Marking the memory ahead of time and freeing it directly from the kernel may turn out to be a more reliable approach.</font><br>
<p>
Uh? Let's say the application has a cache, how could it delegate to the kernel the task to reduce the cache size in 'low memory' condition?<br>

b doesn't sound too pleasant.  Perhaps a process can register the size of memory needed for the task, but that's trying to find a cure for the cure.<br>

I believe that the kernel should reclaim the entire range, however I also think that a big application would have several levels of cache and in the case of tabs each tab might have a cache.<br>
<p>
I don't know what effect having many small POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE ranges would be, but an application could clearly make decisions that would pool small caches into one bigger in order to keep the total number of POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE ranges reasonable.<br>
<p>
Perhaps exposing the average lifetime over the past five minuets of any POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE range would help an application decide if it should even bother.  There can be other performance counters that would help an application determine the number and target size of <br>
POSIX_FADV_VOLATILE ranges.<br>

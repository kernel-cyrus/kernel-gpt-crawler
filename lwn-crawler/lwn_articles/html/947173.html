Programs running in the BPF machine can, depending on how they are
attached, perform a number of privileged operations; the ability to load
and run those programs, thus, must be a privileged operation in its own
right.  Almost since the beginning of the extended-BPF era, developers have
struggled to find a way to allow users to run the programs they need
without giving away more privilege than is necessary.  Earlier this year,
the idea of a <a href="/Articles/935195/">BPF token</a> ran into some
opposition from security-oriented developers.  Andrii Nakryiko has since
returned with <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20230927225809.2049655-1-andrii@kernel.org/">an
updated patch set</a> that significantly increases the granularity of the
privileges that can be conferred with a BPF token.
<p>
In the early days, the ability to load most BPF programs was restricted to
processes with the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability.  That capability,
though, allows a user to do far more than load BPF programs; it is
essentially equivalent to full root access.  In the 5.8 release, the <a
href="/Articles/822362/"><tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability</a> was added to
regulate access to most BPF operations; other capabilities may be required
as well for some specific actions.  <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> still allows a process
to do a lot of things, though, probably more than an administrator would
like.
<p>
As a result, there is a longstanding interest in finding ways to further
confine what processes can do with BPF.  Various approaches, including <a
href="/Articles/929746/">adding authoritative hooks</a> to the Linux
security module mechanism and <a href="/Articles/792124/">a special BPF
device</a> have been tried and rejected.  The BPF token, a sort of digital
cookie conferring the right to load BPF programs, seemed like it could be
headed toward a similar end.  Nakryiko and other BPF developers remain
convinced that the security needs for BPF are unique, though, and that a
unique solution for those needs is required; they have not yet given up on
the idea of a token as that solution.
<p>
Much of the time, the answer to the limited-privilege question is to run
the process needing privilege within some sort of container.  <a
href="/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> can often be used for this
purpose, perhaps combined with a properly constructed mount namespace.
Many of the things that BPF programs can do, such as attaching to
tracepoints, are inherently global in nature, though, and cannot be
contained in this way.  For this reason, simply giving a process
<tt>CAP_BPF</tt> within a user namespace is not a solution to the problem;
the kernel ignores <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> at the namespace level.
<p>
BPF tokens are a way to give a process within a container the equivalent of
the <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability.  One of the concerns expressed with the
original proposal, though, was that a token might escape from the
container it was intended for, causing privilege to leak into the rest of
the system.  In the current proposal, a BPF token is tied to both a
specific instance of the BPF filesystem (which holds persistent BPF objects
like maps) and a user namespace.  Any given token should, as a result, be
useless outside of the context it was intended for.
<p>
The first step in enabling this functionality is to augment the BPF
filesystem with a new set of mount options controlling a specific
instance's interaction with BPF tokens:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>delegate_cmds</tt> lists the commands that a BPF token associated
     with this mount can allow.  Thus, for example, a BPF filesystem could
     be mounted to support tokens allowing reading elements from maps but
     nothing else, while another could allow map creation, loading
     programs, or the creation of tokens.
<li> <tt>delegate_maps</tt> controls the types of maps that a token can
     enable a process to create.  This option only makes sense if
     <tt>BPF_MAP_CREATE</tt> is included in <tt>delegate_cmds</tt>.
<li> <tt>delegate_progs</tt> specifies which types of programs a token
     can enable a process to load; <tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> must also be in
     <tt>delegate_cmds</tt> for any type of program loading to be allowed.
<li> <tt>delegate_attachs</tt> (not <tt>attaches</tt>, alas) controls the
     attach types that a token can allow — once again, if the loading of
     programs is allowed at all.  See <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/libbpf/program_types.html">this
     page</a> for a list of program and attach types.
</ul>
<p>
All of these values are bitmaps corresponding to the definitions in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L121"><tt>&lt;uapi/linux/bpf.h&gt;</tt></a>.
Thus, for example, mounting a BPF filesystem with:
<p>
<pre>
    delegate_cmds=0x21
</pre>
<p>
would enable <tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> (<tt>0x20</tt>) and
<tt>BPF_MAP_CREATE</tt> (<tt>0x01</tt>).  Nakryiko
acknowledges that this is not the friendliest of interfaces, especially
since the values are defined in <tt>enum</tt>s and the user must carefully
count to find the relevant bit numbers; the ability to use symbolic names
will probably appear at some point in the future.  Meanwhile, the special
value "<tt>any</tt>" is equivalent to setting all of the bits for a given
option.
<p>
Once a suitable BPF filesystem has been mounted, presumably within a
container, a program with the right privileges can use the
<tt>BPF_TOKEN_CREATE</tt> command to create a new BPF token.  
An open file descriptor indicating the BPF filesystem mount to use must be
passed as a parameter; the resulting token
will be forever associated with that BPF filesystem, which defines the
operations that the token can allow.  It also is attached to the user
namespace associated with the BPF filesystem mount.  That association
prevents the token from being used outside the namespace, but has another
important implication as well.
<p>
The return value from a <tt>BPF_TOKEN_CREATE</tt> operation is a new file
descriptor representing the token; it can then be passed to the intended
user via the usual mechanisms.  That user can include the token with any
<tt>bpf()</tt> calls that it makes by putting it into the new fields added
to the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L1323">the
sprawling <tt>bpf_attr</tt> union</a> for each command.  For example, when
creating a new map with <tt>BPF_MAP_CREATE</tt>, the token can be placed in
the new <tt>map_token_fd</tt> field.  It's worth noting that, consistent
with the BPF subsystem's conventions, zero is not considered to be a
legitimate file-descriptor number, and so cannot be used for the token
descriptor.
<p>
When the kernel is considering whether to allow a specific <tt>bpf()</tt>
call to succeed, it will check for the presence of a token that allows the
requested operation.  Possession of the token is not sufficient to allow
the operation, though; the calling process must also have the required
capabilities (<tt>CAP_BPF</tt>, plus perhaps others for some operations).
In current kernels, these capabilities must come from the global init
namespace; with the patch applied, they can granted by the user
namespace containing the requesting process.  As a result, a container can
be given the ability to execute specific BPF operations without giving that
privilege to <i>every</i> process within the container.
<p>
Thus, a process running within a user namespace will be able to carry out
BPF operations, but only if it possesses a valid BPF token, that token
allows the specific operation being requested, and the process has the
requisite capabilities within its user namespace.  This patch series does
seem to provide the way to tightly control what can be done with BPF.
For now, the abilities set in a BPF filesystem mount apply to all tokens
created with that filesystem.  In the future, there will likely be an
additional operation that allows the holder of a token to remove specific
abilities, further restricting what the token allows.
<p>
Thus far, there have been few comments on this version of the patch set,
and none that question the core concept; most of the discussion has focused
on the details of integrating Linux security module support.  So it would
seem that most of the objections to previous versions have been addressed.
Should that situation hold, then the path into the mainline for this work
seems reasonably clear.  Token-based security mechanisms have not had a
place in Linux until now, so some new ground is being broken here.  That
could be said to be unsurprising; BPF has been challenging established ways
of doing things in Linux for some years at this point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This appears aimed at solving the problem of "who can run BPF programs", which I imagine matters for certain use cases. However, as the owner of a very locked down system, that is not a very interesting question for me. What stops me from enabling BPF on these systems is an answer to the question of "_which_ BPF programs are allowed to run". Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem these patches can address this issue?<br>

No, you are exactly right. Which is why I don't see much value in this approach as a general "security solution" for BPF. It solves exactly one problem: allowing a container workload that uses BPF to be slightly more constrained by using user namespaces with this BPF-specific hole punched in it.<br>
<p>
This is fine for environments where the whole software stack is under the control of a single entity (e.g., the hyperscalers who also happen to be who is pushing this). But for a full security solution there also needs to be some constraint on *which* programs can be loaded, as you point out. Sadly no one has come up with a good solution for that so far. Signing (like for kernel modules) doesn't really work well because of the dynamic nature of BPF programs. There have been some attempts to find a way around this, but nothing that's really caught on...<br>

Well, my former colleague Matteo had a working and simple patchset that treated precompiled co-re bpf programs like kernel modules: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20211203191844.69709-1-mcroce@linux.microsoft.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20211203191844.69709-1-mcroce...</a><br>
Sure, it doesn't help with the jit-compiled ones, but one can conceivably restrict that and be limited to pre-compiled programs only. But it was rejected in favour of a different bpf-native approach, that after 2 years sadly hasn't happened yet.<br>

Ah yes, now that you mention it, I vaguely remember that discussion. Yeah, sadly nothing comprehensive has materialised yet. I would have liked to have a mechanism that just delegates the policy decisions to userspace (similar to seccomp-notify, but bpf-specific so the kernel can ensure consistency and make sure we avoid TOCTOU races), but that didn't fly with upstream either.<br>
<p>
For container deployments we are also experimenting with just doing everything in userspace: <a href="https://bpfd.dev/">https://bpfd.dev/</a><br>
This uses a "system daemon will load BPF on your behalf" model, and will allow arbitrary verification (including through signatures). But of course it requires you to trust the system daemon, and it precludes some of the dynamic code generation stuff that John was talking about in that thread you linked. So again, tradeoffs...<br>

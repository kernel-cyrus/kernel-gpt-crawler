<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 18, 2019</br>
           </div>
As has been recently <a href="/Articles/784574/">discussed</a> here,
developers for the filesystem and memory-management subsystems have been
grappling for years with the problems posed by the <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>
mechanism.  This function maps memory into the kernel's address space for
direct access by the kernel or peripheral devices, but that kind of access
can create confusion in the filesystem layers, which may not be expecting
that memory to be written to at any given time.  A new <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190411210834.4105-1-jglisse@redhat.com/">patch
set</a> from Jérôme Glisse tries to chip away at a piece of the problem,
but a complete solution is not yet in view.
<p>
The problem with <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> is relatively simple to
understand: filesystems go to great lengths to track whether any given file
page in memory is in a clean state — whether it matches the data in
persistent storage — or not.  When necessary, they use the
memory-management subsystem to 
prevent changes to specific pages so that those pages can be written in a
known state; once a page is clean it can be made writable again.  Pointers
to pages obtained by <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> bypass this mechanism,
though; peripheral devices remain able to write data to those pages at any
time.  A poorly timed write can lead to data corruption or kernel crashes,
neither of which is likely to be the behavior the user of the system is
hoping for.  Things get even more complicated if the pages in question are
stored in persistent memory.
<p>
The above-linked article covered a nascent plan to track pages that have
references created by <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, perhaps by playing tricks
with the page reference counts.  Recent <a
href="/Articles/786044/">reference-counting changes</a> might just have
thrown a spanner into that works, though; the implementation of this
plan
has not yet been posted.  Glisse's patch set is intended to work with it
once it is around, though; in particular, it is designed to get the block
layer to 
do its part to ensure that the tracking is correct.  To do so, it creates a new
mechanism to track the origin of pages that are given to the block layer
with I/O requests.
<p>
<h4>A new bio_vec</h4>
<p>
Filesystems generate I/O operations in response to file read and write
requests; those operations are represented by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/linux/blk_types.h#L140"><tt>struct
bio</tt></a>; it is common usage to call one of these structures a "BIO".
Within a BIO, the data to be transferred is represented by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/linux/bvec.h#L27"><tt>struct
bio_vec</tt></a>:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bio_vec {
	struct page	*bv_page;
	unsigned int	bv_len;
	unsigned int	bv_offset;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Of note here is the <tt>bv_page</tt> field, which points to a <tt>page</tt>
structure for the 
memory page holding the data of interest.  For normal buffered I/O, that
page is probably owned by the kernel and resident in the page cache; there
is no need to call <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> to get that pointer.  For some
types of operations, though, including direct I/O requests, that page may
belong to a user-space process.  Executing such requests requires calling
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> to ensure that the page is locked in memory and
to obtain a pointer to its <tt>page</tt> structure.
<p>
The purpose of Glisse's patch set is to enable filesystems and the block
layer to track the origin of pages found in these <tt>bio_vec</tt>
structures.  The approach taken to get there is not entirely obvious; it
starts by changing the <tt>bv_page</tt> member to:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long   bv_pfn;
</pre>
<p>
The pointer to the <tt>page</tt> structure has been changed to an integer
page-frame number (or PFN).  To simplify the picture a bit, one can imagine
that the kernel maintains a big array of <tt>page</tt> structures, one for
each page of memory in the system.  As a <tt>struct page</tt> pointer,
<tt>bv_page</tt> pointed directly to one entry in that array.  A page-frame
number, instead, can be thought of as an integer index into that array.
<p>
For the most part, the two ways of representing a page are equivalent, but there
is a difference that is being exploited here.  A pointer is a full 64-bit
value; it leaves no space to stuff in an extra bit of information or two.
(That is not strictly true; if one assumes certain alignment restrictions,
the low-order bit(s) might be usable for other purposes.  In fact, the
kernel often uses the low-order bits of pointers to store related
information).  Page-frame numbers, instead, can be thought of as pointers
with the bottom 12&nbsp;bits removed since they do not track offsets within
a page.  They require less space, and thus
provide more space to cram in other data.
<p>
The patch set uses the highest-order bit in the PFN to store a flag called
<tt>BVEC_PFN_GUP</tt>; that bit will be set if the page in question has
been obtained through <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  Getting there is not a
trivial task, though.  In current kernels, code that manipulates
<tt>bio_vec</tt> structures will access the <tt>bv_page</tt> field
directly; all of those accesses had to be changed to use helper functions
instead.  That required <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190411210834.4105-6-jglisse@redhat.com/">a large
patch</a> touching 92 files all over the kernel.  Even then, the new
information can only be stored if creators of BIOs make a note of where
their pages came from.  That requires changing functions like <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/block/bio.c#L809">bio_add_page()</a></tt>
to have an <tt>is_gup</tt> parameter describing the origin of each page —
and changing every caller as well.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190411210834.4105-11-jglisse@redhat.com/">That
patch</a> touches 56&nbsp;files.
<p>
Toward the end of a 15-part patch series, the block layer is able to keep
track of which pages given to it originally came from a
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> request.  All of this work appears to have been
done for one reason: so that the block layer can properly release
references to those pages.
<p>
<h4>Properly putting pages</h4>
<p>
The tracking mechanism mentioned at the beginning of this article is meant
to keep filesystems (and other kernel code) informed about which pages have
references created by <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  One piece of that puzzle
is keeping track of when one of those references is released; that is done
by requiring a call to the proposed <tt>put_user_page()</tt> function to
release a reference rather than <tt>put_page()</tt>.  This function has not
yet been merged (it is likely to show up in 5.2), and the
reference-tracking mechanism it is meant to support has not yet been seen.
But simply finding and converting all callers is expected to be a lengthy
process, so the plan is to put the API in place first.
<p>
One significant caller is the block layer.  Filesystems hand pages to the
block layer (inside BIOs) with a request to perform I/O on those pages.
When that I/O completes at some future time, it is the block layer's job to
release the references to those pages that were created when the BIO is
built.  The context in which this happens is far removed from when the BIO
was created, so any information needed by the block layer to release these
references properly must be stored in the BIO itself.  That, of course, is
the purpose of this new tracking mechanism: it's all there so that the
block layer knows whether to call <tt>put_page()</tt> or
<tt>put_user_page()</tt>.
<p>
All of this mechanism only solves one piece of the puzzle: knowing whether
a given page has references created by <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> or not.
Among the nagging little details that have not yet been addressed is this one:
what will filesystems actually do with that information once it's reliably
available?  There has been talk of using bounce buffers for I/O or simply
keeping those pages in a permanently dirty state, but no code has been
posted yet.  Until that happens and gives developers a look at how this
information will be used, it may prove hard to get this new tracking
mechanism upstream.  Indeed, Glisse indicated in the posting that he does
not expect to see it merged before 5.3.  One might well expect, though,
that there will be some lively discussions about it at the upcoming <a

PFNs are most definitely not uintptr_t. For example, on a 32-bit platform with PAE, PFNs can use up to 28 bits, letting us support up to 1TB of memory with a 4kB page size. They really are just an integer.<br>

uintptr_t is just an integer as well. If it exists, it's a typedef name for an unsigned integer type which is large enough to store a pointer value. As page frame numbers are smaller than pointers due to coarser granularity, that's obviously not a property which would be needed here but it wouldn't do any harm, either.<br>

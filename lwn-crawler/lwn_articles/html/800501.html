</div>
The <a href="/Articles/544399/">multipath TCP (MPTCP)</a> protocol (and the
Linux implementation of it) have been
under development for a solid decade; MPTCP offers a number of advantages for
devices that have more than one network interface available.  Despite
having been deployed widely, though, MPTCP is still not supported by the
upstream Linux kernel.  At the 2019 Linux Plumbers Conference, Matthieu
Baerts and Mat Martineau discussed the current state of the Linux MPTCP
implementation and what will be required to get it into the mainline
kernel.
<p>
MPTCP, described by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6824">RFC
6824</a>, is built around one fundamental idea: allowing a single network
connection to exchange data over multiple physical paths.  One obvious use
case is a phone handset, which has both WiFi and broadband interfaces.
Being able to use both at the same time would give the device greater
bandwidth, but also greater redundancy â€” a connection could continue
uninterrupted despite changes to individual paths.
<p>
Apple added MPTCP support in 2013, mostly to support easier failover
between paths.  The "walk-out" use case, where a user working over WiFi
leaves the building and must switch to broadband, is prominent here.

<a href="/Articles/800517/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/MatthieuBaerts-sm.jpg" alt="[Matthieu Baerts]"
title="Matthieu Baerts" class="rthumb"></a>

Others, including Samsung and LG, have patched in MPTCP support to gain
access to greater bandwidth.  MPTCP is also being added to residential
network gateways, which have both DSL and LTE interfaces, again for greater
bandwidth.  The 5G standards also include MPTCP.
<p>
The Linux implementation was started in March 2009; over the following ten
years it has 
reached version 0.95.  It is already used by millions, Baerts said, but it
is not in a condition where it can be upstreamed.  The MPTCP developers are
working on changing that, but there are a number of constraints they have
to work under, the first of which being that the addition of MPTCP cannot
affect the existing TCP stack.  In particular, there can be no performance
regressions, and no increase in code size if MPTCP is disabled.  The
protocol itself is strictly opt-in; applications must ask for it
explicitly.  The plan is to proceed in small steps, merging a minimal
feature set first.
<p>
<h4>The MPTCP protocol</h4>

Baerts then launched into a quick overview of the MPTCP protocol which, he
said, looks as much like vanilla TCP as possible.  Due to the proliferation
of network middleboxes that refuse to pass traffic they don't recognize,
the addition of new protocols to the open Internet is a difficult task.
There are two approaches that can work; one of which is <a
href="/Articles/745590/">the QUIC way</a>, with all of the protocol details
hidden from middleboxes.  The other, taken by MPTCP, is to look just like
an existing protocol.  So the "subflows" used to carry traffic over a
specific path are just basic TCP connections.
<p>
The new protocol does have to carry some information to tie those connections
together, though.  That is done in a few ways, starting with the "data
sequence number" that is uniform across all connections.  There is an MPTCP
option in the TCP header, and a set of new SYN flags to indicate MPTCP
capability or add a connection to an existing MPTCP session.  There is some
extra signaling to, for example, announce the availability of additional
addresses.  Receive windows across the TCP connections have to be coupled
to provide a single window at the MPTCP level.
<p>
As it turns out, there are two versions of the MPTCP protocol: RFC 6824 and
the newer <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis/">RFC 6824bis</a>
draft.  The latter has been submitted for publication, and is the version
that the MPTCP v1.0 patch will support.  The modifications in the newer
draft make it easier to implement, and 5G is using that version of the
standard as 
well, so it is to be expected that all users will switch over relatively
quickly.  Baerts asked whether focusing on just RFC 6824bis would be
acceptable to the networking developers; Eric Dumazet replied that it would
be fine.
<p>
<h4>Getting it upstream</h4>
<p>
There was <a href="/Articles/791376/">a patch set</a> sent to the lists in
June.  It creates a new protocol type (<tt>IPPROTO_MPTCP</tt>) that
applications can use to select multipath.  Baerts noted that this patch set
does not yet support IPv6; adding that support should not be hard,
but the 
MPTCP developers don't want to focus on it now.  A member of the audience
quickly suggested that the group should do the opposite: implement IPv6
only, and add IPv4 support later.  Dave Miller said that the basic
functionality needs to be submitted at the beginning, and that includes
IPv6 support.  We are, he said, way past the point of allowing
IPv4-specific protocol implementations.
<p>
The developers are also uncertain about how to set socket options on MPTCP
subflows.  They don't want to settle on an API at this point, Baerts said,
so there will be no user-space access to subflows for now.
<p>
Then, there is the question of who should be able to create MPTCP sockets.
The first 
implementation will not be fully hardened; there have been no fuzzing
efforts yet, for example.  The plan is to include a sysctl knob to control
access to the feature; it will be off by default and specific to each
network namespace.  Miller shot down that idea as well; if the code is to
be accepted, he said, it should be functional.  It should not be off by
default, and in any case there are too many knobs in the system already.
Alexei Starovoitov said that the receive path is more worrisome anyway, and
that can't be controlled by a sysctl knob.  Apple had a remote security
issue that could be used to jailbreak phones; he would like to avoid that
in Linux.
<p>
<h4>Use cases</h4>
<p>
The initial use case for MPTCP, Martineau said, is the server role.  The
path management issues are far simpler; clients, instead, have the
complexity of multiple interfaces to deal with.  Some of the requisite
low-level pieces have already been upstreamed.  He mentioned <a
href="/ml/netdev/20181218161527.2760-1-fw@strlen.de/">SKB extensions</a> 
in particular; they are a way of attaching additional information to
packets in the kernel without bloating the (already too large)
<tt>sk_buff</tt> structure.  SKB extensions have already been used to
remove a couple of unrelated pointers from that structure, making things
better overall.
<p>
Once the initial merge has happened, work on adding more features can
begin.  Moving beyond the server use case is high on the list at that

<a href="/Articles/800518/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/MatMartineau-sm.jpg" alt="[Mat Martineau]"
title="Mat Martineau" class="rthumb"></a>

point.  There is also a need to support a user-space path manager that can
add and remove paths while applying whatever policy the system
administrator might configure.  Work on the user-space side can be found <a
href="https://github.com/intel/mptcpd">on GitHub</a>.
<p>
Another area for future development is a packet scheduler that can decide
which path should be used for each packet.  It could be configured to
optimize for throughput, latency, or redundancy.  This is relatively simple
to do on the server side, where it is mostly a matter of acting on requests
from the peer on each MPTCP connection.  The kernel will feature a "basic"
scheduler; the addition of a BPF hook for more complex cases seems nearly
inevitable.
<p>
As mentioned above, MPTCP will be entirely opt-in; it will not be used
unless an application explicitly requests it.  But, naturally, there are
users who want their unmodified binary programs to start using MPTCP once
it's available.  There is a working, if inelegant, solution to this
problem.  A new control-group hook allows the installation of a BPF program
that runs 
when a program calls <tt>socket()</tt>; it can change the requested
protocol to <tt>IPPROTO_MPTCP</tt> and the calling application will be none
the wiser.
<p>
The "break before make" feature would allow the establishment of an MPTCP
connection that initially has no subflows at all.  It may be useful for cases
like switching between multiple access points.  This feature will be added
if the demand for it materializes.  There will eventually be a need to be
able to set socket options on subflows; this will have to be handled
carefully since a number of them could interfere with ordinary TCP.
<p>
Finally, Martineau mentioned the problem of <a
href="/Articles/666509/">in-kernel TLS support</a>.  Since MPTCP is not
TCP, it lacks the upper-level protocol support needed for TLS.  With enough
work, support could be added, and it would still be possible to split TLS
data across flows.  That becomes hard, though, when hardware acceleration
is involved; it's not clear what the solution there will be.

I wonder if multipath TCP can improve using TCP with an anycast address. Right now the problem is that if different packets of a TCP stream hit different servers sharing an IP it will be broken. This is currently solved with fancy routing to create session stickyness. <br>
<p>
I imagine with multipath TCP it would be possible to receive the connection on the anycast address then quickly fail over to a flow on an IP address that is specific to the host the packet landed on. <br>
<p>
It probably doesn't completely remove the need for sticky routing however it should reduce the (already rare) case where the session rerouted outside of your sticky routing domain (for example landing on a different PoP). <br>

I dunno if this would make sense to implement in the OS kernel, but you could build this exact behavior into an application by having an anycast service that just returns the IP (and port?) you want the client to load balance to, followed by an MTCP connection to that service.  One could probably make that into a client library and server daemon to make it easy to be integrated into any software that wanted to behave this way but the OS provides all the primitives necessary to have this work, and there probably isn't any benefit in abstracting that away into the kernel as opposed to having userspace control all the knobs and build on top.<br>

You can definitely do it this way. DNS is commonly used as that anycast service. However there are a number of reasons this isn't quite ideal including staleness or added latency. <br>
<p>
Doing it via MPTCP means that you don't have any added latency in exchange for no guarantee that the "connection" doesn't get migrated to a different target before the "handover" to the server IP. <br>

You are right, Multipath TCP can be tuned to better support load-balancers and anycast. The trick for anycast is very simple. The client sends a SYN to the anycast address. It reaches one of the servers that replies and returns its regular IP address using the ADD_ADDR option supported by Multipath TCP. The client can either create a new subflow towards the server's real IP address or wait until routing changes break the initial subflow.<br>
<p>
This technique was proposed and evaluated in Making Multipath TCP friendlier to Load Balancers and Anycast, see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/publications/making-multipath-tcp-friendlier-load-balancers-and-anycast.html">https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/publications/making-multipath-...</a> <br>
It also works for load balancers and has been included in RFC6824bis<br>

IMHO the simplest method of making regular application use multi[path TCP without recompiling them might be a LD_PRELOAD object which automagically replaces regular TCP with the multipath version. An object like this could be smart enough not to use multipath TCP in when it inappropriate, for example connections to the local host. This would not require any kernel support and work for almost all applications.<br>
<p>
Some very high performance network products feature LD_PRELOAD objects which make regular application exploit the hardware, often in user space. Applications include stock trading applications where the fact that c is finite matters. This hardware is seriously expensive because high stakes bond trading and supercomputers can both justify expensive hardware.<br>

tcp is dead. non-encrypted connections are dead (perhaps besides intra-datacenter).<br>
<p>
i feel the best course of action must be to fold all these wonderful efforts into QUIC. no?<br>

And you can still write new software in COBOL, too. Doesn't mean it's not dead.<br>

TCP is very much alive.<br>
<p>
QUIC is a very cool protocol and effectively support multi-path out of the box since IP and port aren't used to identify connections. In fact roaming works a lot better than MPTCP since you don't need to report your new IP+Port before breaking the old connection, which means you can migrate between two WiFi access points or similar where there is never an overlap where you are connected to both networks.<br>
<p>
However TCP is far from dead, and this is still very useful until then (if it ever happens).<br>

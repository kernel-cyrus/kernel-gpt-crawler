The <a href="/Articles/982077/">BPF verifier</a> is charged with the
challenging task of ensuring that a BPF program is safe for the kernel to
run before that program is loaded.  Among many other concerns, the verifier
must ensure that any kfuncs (kernel functions that have been exported to
BPF programs) are called with the correct parameters and from the right
context.  The "context" part of that enforcement is showing its age in ways
that are hurting performance; Juntong Deng has been working on
infrastructure to provide finer-grained control over when a kfunc can be
called.
<p>
Every BPF program is assigned a specific type; the full list of types can
be found in <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/libbpf/program_types.html">Documentation/bpf/libbpf/program_types.rst</a>.
So, for example, <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_FLOW_DISSECTOR</tt> is for programs that
implement <a href="/Articles/764200/">network flow dissectors</a>, while
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM</tt> is for programs run from the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/prog_lsm.html">BPF Linux Security
Module</a>.  The kernel will not allow a program to be attached to a BPF
hook if the program is not of the correct type for that hook.  This
restriction prevents BPF programs from being invoked from contexts that
they are not designed for.
<p>
The kernel's kfunc mechanism is a relatively recent addition that allows any
function within the kernel to be made available for direct calling from a
BPF program.  Here, too, it is important that kfuncs are only called from
the correct context.  So, whenever a set of kfuncs is registered with the
BPF subsystem (using a call to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.1/source/kernel/bpf/btf.c#L8624"><tt>register_btf_kfunc_id_set()</tt></a>),
the program type must be supplied; the verifier will ensure that only
programs of the given type can call a kfunc from that set.
<p>
This machinery works but has come under increasing strain over the years.
The number of program types has grown considerably, and that has led to a
desire to restrain that growth (without, of course, slowing the incursion
of BPF into the few parts of the kernel where it is not yet found).  That
has resulted in BPF program types becoming more generic; in particular, the
<a href="/Articles/811631/">"struct ops" mechanism</a> allows a BPF program
to provide a structure full of functions that the kernel can call, under
the <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS</tt> program type.  There are quite a few
programs out there of this type that run in all kinds of contexts.
<p>
Any verification mechanism that relies on just the program type will be
unable to tell one struct-ops program from another.  Beyond that, though,
there are reasons to treat the different functions called within a single
struct-ops program as having different contexts.  The BPF subsystem is
currently unable to make that distinction, and that has complicated
life.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>

In <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB5080C05323552276324C4B4C991A2@AM6PR03MB5080.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">this
patch set</a>, Deng pointed to the <a href="/Articles/991205/">sched_ext
subsystem</a>, which allows CPU schedulers to be written in BPF, as an
example of this problem.  A
sched_ext program is of type <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS</tt>; when it
loads, it provides a structure of type <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.1/source/kernel/sched/ext.c#L199"><tt>sched_ext_ops</tt></a>
with about three-dozen different function pointers, each for a callback
that handles one aspect of the scheduling problem.  The <tt>runnable()</tt>
callback, for example, is invoked when a task becomes runnable and must be
placed into a run queue, while <tt>cpu_offline()</tt> is called if a CPU is
being removed from the system and tasks must be moved off of it.  Clearly,
the context in which these callbacks are called will vary considerably from
one to the next.
<p>
The sched_ext subsystem also provides a number of kfuncs that allow BPF
programs to perform scheduling tasks, such as putting a task onto a
specific CPU.  It is only appropriate to call some of those kfuncs from specific
<tt>sched_ext_ops</tt> functions, though; they only make sense
during the appropriate parts of the scheduling flow.  To avoid problems, the
sched_ext subsystem must track which BPF function is being called at the
moment and, when a kfunc is invoked, ensure (with a call to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.1/source/kernel/sched/ext.c#L1162"><tt>scx_kf_allowed()</tt></a>)
that the calling context is correct.  This is an extra run-time check that
would be more nicely done at load time; evidently this check is expensive
enough to impact the performance of sched_ext schedulers.
<p>
Deng's first solution to this problem was 
to add a "capabilities" mechanism to the BPF subsystem.  A
capability mask (a 32-bit integer value) was added to each kfunc; bits set
in that mask would indicate the capabilities needed to be able to call the
kfunc.  Each kfunc could then be registered along with the requisite
capabilities.  The patch set also provided a new callback
(<tt>bpf_capabilities_adjust()</tt>) that would allow a subsystem (such as
sched_ext) to specify which capabilities are held by a BPF program that it
might run.  This callback is invoked separately by the verifier during the
checking of each <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS</tt> function, allowing each
to be provided with separate capabilities that may (or may not) make a given
kfunc available.  The end result is that the verifier gained the ability to
prevent inappropriate kfunc calls at load time, and the run-time overhead
was eliminated.
<p>
This implementation raised some concerns, though.  Tejun Heo <a
href="/ml/all/Z4qMOUq1KXTX-5cD@slm.duckdns.org/">pointed out</a> that a
32-bit mask for capabilities would surely be exhausted at some point.  He
also wondered if it was necessary to declare capabilities globally at all;
given that the callback was needed in any case, it could just accept
context information and make purely local decisions at that time.  Alexei
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/all/CAADnVQLidcL-WU-VWXZtBph=qjJfAhoyrsYWyL7JwB0ZEH5KFQ@mail.gmail.com/">took
issue</a> with the term "capabilities", which already has a well-defined
meaning in the kernel, but he also thought that the concept was
unnecessary.  He suggested just implementing this functionality as a filter
callback instead.
<p>
Filters are a similar mechanism that were <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e924e80ee6a3">added</a> during the 6.5
cycle by Aditi Ghag.  They are yet another callback that is associated with
each kfunc.  The verifier will call this <tt>filter()</tt> function, if it
exists, to determine whether a given call should be allowed or not.  This
functionality does seem quite similar to what capabilities brought, but
Deng <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB508053DF89CDFEB95CBEB20C99E32@AM6PR03MB5080.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com/">had
some reservations</a> about using it; in particular, filter functions do
not work with kernel subsystems implemented as loadable modules.
Starovoitov, though, <a
href="/ml/all/CAADnVQJN+C2Bdoe1w62vmDrPhcoweBxBy8Ck4a_SWrd5k=493A@mail.gmail.com/">was
unworried</a> about this restriction; the current user for this feature is
sched_ext, which cannot be built as a module.  The immediate problem (the
performance impact on sched_ext) should be solved first, he said; other
concerns can be addressed later if the need arises.
<p>
So Deng <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB5080261D024B49D26F3FFF0099F72@AM6PR03MB5080.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">solved
this problem anew</a>, specifically for sched_ext, using the filter
functionality.  The new series adds some context information to the
(already large) <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.1/source/include/linux/bpf.h#L1493"><tt>bpf_prog_aux</tt></a>
structure that is available to filter functions.  This context consists of
a pointer to the operations structure itself and the byte offset within the
structure of the specific function being called.  Filter functions can use
that information to determine which struct-ops function is being called and
make a decision about whether that call should be allowed.  As can be seen
from <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB50805D6F4B8710EDB304CF5C99F72@AM6PR03MB5080.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">this
patch</a>, for example, this mechanism is arguably not the most elegant
ever, but it does get the job done.
<p>
In any case, it is sufficient to add load-time checks for sched_ext and
eliminate the need for the run-time checks, once again addressing the
performance problem.  There are some residual glitches; if a kfunc appears
in more than one exported set (which happens reasonably often when kfuncs
must be exported to more than one program type), the filter no longer knows
which offset to use and can make incorrect decisions.  That causes at least
one sched_ext program to fail to load with the current patch set.  There are
ways to work around this problem, including adding a simple wrapper
for the kfunc to distinguish between the calling contexts, but this seems
like the kind of trap that can easily snare unwary developers.
<p>
This new series is fresh as of this writing and has not yet generated any
discussion.  It does appear to have addressed the concerns raised the first
time around, though, and to solve the immediate problem.  So, while
"capabilities" will not be coming to BPF programs anytime soon, better
load-time decisions on the validity of kfunc calls would appear to be on
the horizon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<h1>On-demand readahead</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 21, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
"Readahead" is the act of speculatively reading a portion of a file's
contents into memory in the expectation that a process working with that
file will soon want that data.  When readahead works well, a data-consuming
process will find that the information it needs is available to it when it
asks, and that waiting for disk I/O is not necessary.  The Linux kernel has
done readahead for a long time, but that does not mean that it cannot be
done better.  To that end, Fengguang Wu has been working on a set of
"adaptive readahead" patches for a couple of years.
<p>
Adaptive readahead was <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/155510/">covered
here</a> in 2005.  The patches have been languishing in the -mm tree for
one simple reason: their complexity is at such a level that few people are
able to review them in any useful way.  The new <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/234784/">on-demand readahead patch</a> is a
response to a request from Andrew Morton for a simpler patch to help get
the merge process going.  The new code is indeed simpler, having dispensed
with much of the logic found in the full adaptive readahead mechanism.
<p>

To a great extent, the on-demand patch reimplements what Linux readahead
does currently, but in a simpler and more flexible way.  Like the current
code, the on-demand patch maintains a "readahead window" consisting of a
portion of the file starting with the application's last read.  Pages
inside the readahead window should already be in the page cache - or, at
least, under I/O to get there as soon as possible.  The window moves
forward as the application reads data from the file.
<p>

The current code actually implements two windows, being the "current
window" (a set of in-cache pages which includes the application's current
position) and the "ahead window," being the pages most recently read in by
the kernel.  Once the application's position crosses from the current
window into the ahead window, a new I/O operation is started to make a new
ahead window.  In this way, the kernel tries to always keep sufficiently
far ahead of the application that the file data will be available when
requested.
<p>

The on-demand patch, instead, has a single readahead window.  Rather than
maintain a separate "ahead window," the new readahead code marks a page
(using a flag in the <tt>page</tt> structure) as being at the "lookahead
index."  When an application reads its way into the marked page, the
readahead window is extended and a new I/O operation is started.  There is
some resistance to the idea of using a page flag, since those bits are
perennially in short supply.  Andrew Morton has <a
href="/Articles/235175/">suggested</a> using some more approximate
heuristics instead.  That approach might occasionally make the wrong
decision, but the penalty is low and does not affect the correctness of the
system's operation as a whole.
<p>

While the on-demand patch appears to do relatively little, it does have the
advantage of removing a bunch of complexity from the current readahead
code.  It is able to make its decisions without the overhead of trying to
track events like an attempted readahead of pages which are already in the
cache.  The checks for sequential access are made less strict as well,
causing readahead to stay active in situations where the current code would
turn it off.  The result, according to <a href="/Articles/235181/">some
benchmarks</a> posted with the patch, is improvements in application speed
between 0.1% and 8% or so - with some performance regressions in some
cases.  Interestingly, some of the best results come with a benchmark
running on a MySQL database, which is not where one would normally expect
to see a lot of sequential activity.
<p>

This patch set is clearly simple enough to be reviewed; in the absence of
any strong objections, it could conceivably be ready for 2.6.23.  Then,
perhaps, Fengguang can start working on adding some of the more complex
logic which makes up the full adaptive readahead mechanism.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The place where readahead is really needed is when swapping in a long-idle application.<br>
<p>
Anyone with a modest desktop will have experienced the problem of switching back to an application that has sat idle for half an hour.  The drive thrashes away for minutes as apparently individual pages are faulted in.  This often takes much longer than starting the application from scratch.<br>
<p>
I wonder if the kernel could detect this situation, perhaps by noticing an unusually high sustained rate of reads from the swap file for a given process, and try temporarily reading some larger number of contiguous pages instead of one.<br>
<p>
There are undoubtedly corner cases where this would make things worse but I suspect that overall something like this would be a considerable improvement.<br>

      Swap-in is non-sequential reads, so it's hard to predict which pages to read ahead. OTOH, memory is pretty cheap nowadays (1 GB ~ $50); buying a DIMM may quickly give you a more responsive system. Professional system administrators don't want their systems to swap under normal load.<br>

      More ram isn't necessary to avoid swapping. If you have swap usage you don't have a moderate desktop, but instead a decadent corpulent bloated desktop. That, or you're using something that needs hogs of memory, like video encoding apps, but that's beyond moderate too. I'm doing fine with 256 MB for years, and although ram is dirt cheap, I simply see no reason to buy more of it.<br>

      Yeah, but if you are not using an app, Linux throws out your program to cache more of your hard drive.  Unavoidable.<br>

      DIMMs are cheap in this part of the world but laptops to holder larger DIMMs are not.  In some circumstances it is economical to have sufficient RAM to hold one or two apps but to use swap when three or four are open and temporarily idle.<br>
<p>
The thought was that one could overcome the slow random swap-in reads by reading ahead pages from swap which had been used earlier and would probably therefore be used again.<br>

      When I leave from work, I don't turn off the laptop, just lock the screen. Next morning when I unlock the screen, it takes about 10-15 seconds to have the browser or OpenOffice swapped back. Probably a cronjob needs some memory, that's why they are swapped, but it's still annoying.

      A plausible culprit is the cronjob that runs updatedb so that your 'locate' database is up-to-date.  That churns the cache quite a bit since it involves a lot of disk seeking.<br>

      <p>One thing that would improve this and various other things is actual swapping.  What we call swapping in Linux is really just virtual memory paging.  Swapping is a much older technology in which you remove an entire process from memory to let other processes run, then bring the entire process back when it's turn comes around again.  It's also known as long term scheduling.
<p>
If Linux could notice that a process hasn't accessed <em>any</em> of its pages (hasn't run) in a long time, it could write <em>all</em> the resident pages out to contiguous swap space.  The next time the process runs, it could read it all back.
<p>
Furthermore, if Linux is stealing a page that was accessed quite recently, it ought to steal them all and then wait a while before swapping them all back in again and swapping out somebody else.
<p>
By the way, it would be a mistake to believe that all that paging activity when you sit down to a long-idle session is Linux "swapping."  A lot of it is reading in memory mapped program files.  Speeding that up isn't as easy.

I think it's not very hard.  You just need some history-based
prediction mechanism.  A student of mine has done his <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/Diplomarbeiten/strauss-haslinglehner05.ps.gz">Master's
thesis</a> (in German) on speeding up the startup time of programs by
recording the blocks accessed when starting a program, and then
prefetching them (Windows XP does something like that for the OS
startup).  Similarly, one could record the pages or blocks accessed
soon after a major page fault, and then prefetch all of them the next
time the page faults.

      That's actually different, and a little harder, than what we're talking about here.  We're talking about resuming a process that has been idle for a while.  So all the history you need is the list of pages that were resident the last time the process ran.
<p>
That by itself can't get you to the level of speed that we discussed with anonymous pages, where all those pages were contiguous on disk.
<p>
I know I've seen somewhere a system where you don't ordinarily start a program, but rather reload and resume an entire process.  In that case, the two prefetching problems are probably the same.

      Yes, fetching all the pages that were resident is certainly an
approach for the problem that would work.

<p>Using a history-based prefetcher might have the following
advantages, though:

<ul>

<li>It could fetch fewer pages (e.g., not pages loaded on startup, but
no longer needed, but that were still resident when the process was
swapped out), which would be faster and less disruptive for other
processes.

<li>The prefetcher would also be useful in other situations, like on
startup, or when a process enters a new phase (and therefore needs
many new pages from executable or data files).

</ul>

That being said, a well-balanced history-based prefetcher is certainly
a much larger project than loading the once-resident pages.

      <font class="QuotedText">&gt; A lot of it is reading in memory mapped program files. Speeding that up</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; isn't as easy.</font><br>
<p>
Surely swap prefetch won't help here, indeed. But good readahead would.<br>
<p>
About swapping, the reason it's old is that, as Rik van Riel (and another <br>
reader below) puts it, systems are slower than ages ago. Would you swap <br>
out firefox, ever? Or X?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Furthermore, if Linux is stealing a page that was accessed quite</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; recently, it ought to steal them all and then wait a while before</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; swapping them all back in again and swapping out somebody else.</font><br>
<p>
Well, the swap token was introduced by Rik van Riel to implement something <br>
similar, based on a research paper. Actually it's mostly a mean to prevent <br>
thrashing (which can be what you describe, depending on the times <br>
involved). It didn't work at first and was disabled, but now it should <br>
have been fixed; a new variation of the algorithm was implemented in <br>
7602bdf2fd14a40dd9b104e516fdc05e1bd17952 (in 2.6.20-rc1). LWN described it <br>
well, see Kernel Page Index for more details.<br>

      there is another set of patches that was sent out in the last week or so that addresses readahead for swap-in<br>
<p>
the reports on it were extremely favorable<br>

      Considering the seek times have remained about the same on desktop hard drives for the last 15 years, while transfer speeds has increased maybe 50 fold and capacity is thousand times more than back then, there are quite huge gains to be had with even non-complex improvements if seeks can be reduced. It's one area where readahead may help to some extent, though mainly it's really in applications where you really shouldn't open 2000 files when logging in eg. to certain modern desktop environments.<br>

      I'm not surprised MySQL get the benefits. Databases tend to do a lot of almost-but-not-quite sequential reads. There have been reports of people getting substandard performance on postgres because they run afoul of some assumption the kernel is making with respect to readahead. Increasing the readahead buffer tends to help, but it'd be better is the system was slightly smarter.<br>
<p>
Given the current costs of seeking, it's really better to read in 10x times the amount of data, even if you're almost sure you're not going to need it. The cost of coming back later is very very high.<br>

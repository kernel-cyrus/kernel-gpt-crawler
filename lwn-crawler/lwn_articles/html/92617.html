<h1>Cryptographic signatures on kernel modules</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 7, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
The latest Fedora Rawhide kernels come with an interesting feature: the
ability to enforce cryptographic signatures on loadable modules.  This
capability has a few uses:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Preventing the kernel from loading modules which have somehow been 
     corrupted.
<p>
<li> Making it harder for an attacker to install a rootkit on 
     a compromised system.
<p>
<li> Enabling vendors of enterprise Linux distributions to block the
     loading of unapproved modules into stock kernels.
     (It should be noted that, at this point, no vendor has indicated any plans
     to restrict module loading in this way.)
</ul>
<p>
The code which handles signed modules was originally written by Greg
Kroah-Hartman; it has subsequently been fixed up in various ways by David
Howells.  Greg wrote <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7130">a Linux Journal
article</a> about his work back in January.
<p>
The signature code works by looking at the most interesting ELF sections
within a module file: the <tt>.text</tt> (program code) and <tt>.data</tt>
(initialized data) areas.  When the module is built, a script uses the
<tt>objdump</tt> utility to extract those sections; the result can be fed
to <tt>gpg</tt> to generate a signature.  That signature is then patched
into the module as yet another section, called <tt>module_sig</tt>.
Overall, adding signatures is a relatively small change to the module build
process.
<p>
The signatures are not much use, however, if nobody checks them;
implementing that check within the kernel is a somewhat larger business.
The 2.6 kernel includes a whole cryptographic subsystem, but that code is
oriented toward the needs of networking and encrypted filesystems.
Verifying module signatures using public keys was not one of the objectives
when the crypto API was added.  To support this task, several thousand
lines of code must be added to the kernel; they perform arbitrary-precision
integer arithmetic (this code came directly from GnuPG), DSA signature
verification (also from GnuPG), simple in-kernel key management, and the
code to actually verify module data against signatures.  
<p>
As things stand in the patch currently, any public keys used to verify
modules are built directly into the kernel itself.  Being able to add a
site-specific key at run time would be a convenient feature, but it would
also defeat the purpose of this whole exercise.  Any attacker who is in a
position to load malevolent modules could just load a new key first, thus
circumventing the signature verification.  Even as things stand, a kernel
using signature verification should be set up to not allow overwriting of
in-kernel key data by way of <tt>/dev/kmem</tt> and such.
<p>
With all that infrastructure in place, a relatively small set of patches
makes the module loader actually verify signatures.  Once again, the
interesting sections are stripped out, and a checksum is generated with the
SHA1 algorithm.  If the signature in the module (1)&nbsp;can be decrypted
with a public key contained within the kernel, and (2)&nbsp;contains the
same checksum, the module checks out and can be loaded.  
<p>
In the code, one can see the traces of a kernel developer encountering an
interesting problem.  In many systems, the SHA1 transform code is kept in a
loadable module.  The module loader, when it attempts to verify the
signature of a different module, could well force the kernel to try loading
the SHA1 module.  The module code, however, takes the <tt>module_mutex</tt>
semaphore very early in the process; the recursive attempt will thus simply
deadlock the whole thing.  To avoid this problem, the crypto API was
enhanced with a <tt>crypto_alloc_tfm2()</tt> function which can be
instructed to not load any modules while setting itself up.  The SHA1
code will have to be linked directly into the kernel if it is used for
module verification.
<p>
Rawhide kernels come configured to verify any signatures found in modules,
but they will also happily load modules with no signature at all.  There is
a configuration option which tightens things up, however, so that only
signed modules will be accepted.  One wonders how much a proprietary module
vendor might pay to have their public key included in a distributor's stock
kernels once that option is turned on.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I couldn't find this code; can someone point me to where I can download it?  Not a RH aficionado, I'm afraid.<p>In particular, I had an implementation of the same thing which I felt is a better solution that Greg's, and wanted to compare.<p>Thanks,<br>Rusty.

      You would have to use a one-time GPG private key when building kernel+modules or the rootkit would use your private key, sign its module and load it.<p>That in turn means that `make modules` will have to rebuild the kernel  I can live with that :)<p>Similarly, distributions couldn't leave the private key on their systems; if they'd be compromised, many other systems could be loading malafide modules again. Checking (on the network?) for a revoked GPG key seems to defeat the purpose of network modules; moreover, your whole kernel would be useless after revoking such a key.<p>Yet, if this can be used to prevent rootkits like adore to install themselves as invisibly as they can now, I'll start using it asap!<br>

      &gt; You would have to use a one-time GPG private key when building    <br>&gt; kernel+modules or the rootkit would use your private key, sign its  <br>&gt; module and load it. <br> <br>not exactly: first of all the private key is normally protected by a <br>password (so the cracker has to circumvent this first) and second there is <br>no need to store the private key permanently on the system on which the <br>kernel is build. <br> <br>the first point implies that you have to enter your password when running <br>'make modules' the second argument means that you burn your key on CD and <br>only mount it when you need to rebuild some modules.

      This code won't stop rootkits.  The protections it has set up for /dev/mem and /dev/kmem can be easily disabled by modifying the kernel through DMA.  An attacker need only access some device on their system capable of DMA and (ab)use it to write to portions of kernel memory that are denied through /dev/mem and /dev/kmem.<p>Redhat: please stop releasing half-baked solutions and promoting them as complete ones.  You're a mockery of real security researchers, who work much harder than you and provide the code that you &quot;adapt&quot; and repackage and gain all the fame for.<p>I expect in the near future a small application to be written that uses DMA to remove the checks inserted into the code that handles reading/writing of /dev/mem and mmaping of /dev/mem and /dev/kmem (reading/writing /dev/kmem has a return -EPERM at the beginning of the function, so it couldn't be NOP'd out to reveal the clean function).  This application will simply be run before the normal rootkit is installed, without modification.<p>As an aside, where are the people asking about Redhat's attack model for their SELinux policies in Fedora?  Before with &quot;strict&quot; policies, things broke, so they were replaced with &quot;relaxed&quot; policies.  Now people are happy, because &quot;it works.&quot;  Is it really working, or are people just saying &quot;it works&quot; to mean &quot;it's not breaking my system.&quot;  It's amazing how they can tout these features without ever saying what it's supposed to protect against!<p>Of course, Redhat would never tell you this.. ($$ and attention before real security)

      I think your criticism is misdirected. Users require that first, the system must be usable, and second, secure. SELinux made their systems unusable, and if RedHat had left it enabled by default, they would have alienated a lot of users.<p>Integrating SELinux (even if not enabled by default) was a first step toward people using the system, working out problems, writing rule sets, etc. Without reasonable first steps, we would NEVER get to a secure state of security.<p>As for signed executables -- of course it's not a be-all end-all security solution. NOTHING IS. But it raises the bar, and that _is_ worthwhile.

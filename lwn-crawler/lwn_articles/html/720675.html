The <a href="/Articles/552904/">multiqueue block layer subsystem</a>,
introduced in 2013, was a necessary step for the kernel to scale to the fastest
storage devices on large systems.  The implementation in current kernels is
incomplete, though, in that it lacks an I/O scheduler designed to work with
multiqueue devices.  That gap is
currently set to be closed in the 4.12 development cycle when the kernel
will probably get not just one, but two new multiqueue I/O schedulers.
<p>
The lack of an I/O scheduler might seem like a fatal flaw in the multiqueue
code, but the truth is that the need for a scheduler was not clearly
evident at the outset.  High-end drives are generally solid-state devices lacking
rotational delay problems; they are thus not as sensitive to the ordering
of operations.  But it turns out that there is value in I/O scheduling even
for the fastest devices; a scheduler can coalesce adjacent requests,
reducing the overall operation count, and it can prioritize some operations
over others.  So the desire to add I/O scheduling for multiqueue devices
has been there for a while, but the code has been lacking.
<p>
Things got closer in the 4.11 merge window, when the block layer gained
support for I/O scheduling for multiqueue devices.  The deadline I/O
scheduler was ported to this mechanism as a proof of concept, but it was
never seen as the real solution going forward.
<p>
When I/O scheduling support was added, the first intended user was the <a
href="/Articles/674308/">Budget Fair Queuing (BFQ)</a> scheduler.  BFQ has
been in the works for years; it assigns an I/O budget to each process that,
when combined with a bunch of heuristics, is said to produce much better
I/O response, especially on slower devices.  Users with rotational storage
benefit from BFQ, but there are also benefits when using slower solid-state
devices; as a result, there is a fair amount of interest in using BFQ on
devices like mobile handsets, for example.
<p>
The idea that BFQ is an
improvement over the CFQ scheduler found in mainline kernels is fairly
uncontroversial, but getting BFQ merged was still a lengthy process.  One
of the final stumbling blocks was that it was a traditional I/O scheduler
rather than a multiqueue scheduler.  The block subsystem developers have a
long-term goal of moving all drivers to the multiqueue model, and merging a
non-multiqueue I/O scheduler did not seem like a step in that direction.
<p>
Over the last several months, BFQ developer Paolo Valente has worked to
port the code to the multiqueue interface.  The known problems with the
port have been resolved, and block subsystem maintainer Jens Axboe has <a
href="/Articles/720676/">agreed</a> to merge it for 4.12.  If all goes to
plan, the long wait for the BFQ I/O scheduler will finally be at an end.
<p>
The interesting thing is that BFQ will not be the only multiqueue I/O
scheduler entering the mainline in 4.12; there will be another one,
developed over a much shorter time period, that should also be merged then.  One
might well wonder why a second scheduler is needed, especially since kernel
developers place a premium on general solutions that can address a wide
variety of use cases.  But it seems that there is, indeed, a reasonable
case to be made for merging a second multiqueue I/O scheduler.
<p>
BFQ is a complex scheduler that is designed to provide good interactive
response,  especially on those slower devices.  It has a relatively
high per-operation overhead, which is justified when the I/O operations
themselves are slow and expensive.  This complexity may not make sense,
though, in situations where I/O operations are cheap and throughput is a
primary concern.  When running a server workload using solid-state devices,
it may be better to run a much simpler scheduler that allows for request
merging and perhaps some simple policies, but which mostly stays out of the
way.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/720071/">The Kyber I/O scheduler</a>, posted by Omar
Sandoval, would appear to be such a beast.  Kyber is intended for fast
multiqueue devices and lacks much of the complexity found in BFQ; it is
less than 1,000 lines of code.  Its policies, while simple, would appear
to be an interesting echo of the bufferbloat work done in the networking
stack.
<p>
I/O requests passing through Kyber are split into two primary queues, one
for synchronous requests and one for asynchronous requests â€” or, in other
words, one for reads and one for writes.  A process issuing a read request
is typically unable to proceed until that request completes and the data is
available, so such requests are seen as synchronous.  A write operation,
instead, can complete at some later time; the initiating process doesn't
usually care when that write actually happens.  So it is common to
prioritize reads over writes, but not to the point that writes are starved.
<p>
The key to the Kyber algorithm is that the number of operations (both reads
and writes) sent to the dispatch queues (the queues that feed operations
directly to the device) is strictly limited, keeping those queues
relatively short.  If the dispatch queues are short, then the amount of
time that passes while any given request waits in the queues (the
per-request latency) will be relatively small.  That ensures a quick
completion time for higher-priority requests.
<p>
The scheduler tunes the actual number of requests allowed into the dispatch
queues by measuring the completion time of each request and adjusting the
limits to 
achieve the desired latencies.  There are two tuning knobs available to the
system administrator for setting the latency targets; they default to 2ms
for read requests and 10ms for writes.  As always, there will be tradeoffs
in setting these values; setting them too low will ensure low latencies,
but at the cost of reducing the opportunities for the merging of requests,
hurting throughput.
<p>
Kyber, too, has been accepted for the 4.12 merge window.  So, if all goes
according to plan, the 4.12 kernel will have two new options for I/O
scheduling on multiqueue devices.  Users concerned with interactive
response and possibly using slower devices will likely opt for BFQ, while
throughput-sensitive server loads are more likely to run with Kyber.
Either way, an important gap in the kernel's multiqueue block I/O subsystem
has been filled, clearing the path for an eventual transition of all of the
kernel's block drivers to the multiqueue API.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder how those schedulers are going to interact with btrfs? Those schedulers try to ensure fairness between *processes*. But in my observations, when using btrfs most work seem to be dispatched from kworker, btrfs-worker, btrfs-cleaner, btrfs-transaction and other btrfs-* kernel threads, not from original processes.<br>
This btrfs behaviour makes observing I/O traffic troublesome already. I fear it will wreak havoc with fairness.<br>

Unscientific observation : It works well.<br>

I used to see spikes in latency from BTRFS on an internal backup server as it performed rsync --inplace based backups and deleted old snapshots ... which were bad enough to make me try BFQ.<br>

Random details: vanilla 4.9.x kernel + BFQ.  Two WD 3TiB Red disks in a BTRFS raid 1 filesystem. 4 core i5 processor with 32gb of RAM. FS contains 150 readonly snapshots. Currently using about 1.79TiB.<br>

It should work pretty well, but we'll definitely look into any latency problems.  For the most part we're able to tag latency sensitive IOs and get good results from the schedulers.  On the btrfs side, we try to make sure the btrfs IO threads aren't creating priority inversions of their own.<br>

This new scheduler seems to have similarities with deadline. As far as I understand kyber is able to dynamically adapt the size of the queues to serve requests at low latencies whereas deadline will be doing as much as it can.<br>

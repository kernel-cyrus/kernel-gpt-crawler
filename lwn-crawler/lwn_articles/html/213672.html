Some patches make it into the kernel in something very close to their
original form.  Others have to go through a few changes first.  The
all-time record for development iterations  may be held by devfs; Richard
Gooch had just released <a 
href="http://lwn.net/2000/0217/a/devfs-157.html">the 157th revision</a>
when this ill-fated subsystem was merged for 2.3.46.  On that scale,
Evgeniy Polyakov is just getting started with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/213631/">kevent take&nbsp;26</a>; even so,
the process must be starting to seem like a long one.
<p>
In this case, however, the long process can be seen as evidence that the
system is working as it should.  The kevent subsystem is a major addition
to the Linux system call API.  Once it goes in, it will have to be
supported forever (to a finite-precision arithmetic approximation, at
least).  Adding a kevent interface with warts, or which does not provide
the best performance possible, would be a serious mistake.  Nobody wants to
be faced with designing and implementing a new event interface in a few
years while supporting the old one indefinitely.  So it makes sense to go
slowly and make sure that things have been thought out well.
<p>
The number of people posting comments on the kevent patches has been
relatively small; for whatever reason, many normally vocal developers do
not seem to have much to say on this new API.  Fortunately, Ulrich Drepper
(the glibc maintainer) has taken a strong interest in this interface and
has pushed hard for the changes he thought were necessary.  One gets
the sense the Ulrich and Evgeniy have gotten a little tired of each other
over the last month or so.  But, to their credit, they have stuck to the
task.  As of this writing, Ulrich has not commented on the version of the
API implemented in the "take 26" patch set.  It does, however, clearly
reflect some of the things he has been asking for.
<p>

While Evgeniy has been concerned with getting events out of the kernel,
Ulrich has been worried about performance and robustness.  So he wanted
ways for multi-threaded programs to cancel threads at any time without
losing track of which events have been processed.  Whenever possible, he
would like to be able to process events without involving the kernel at
all.  And he has pushed strongly for timeout values to be represented in an
absolute format.  Evgeniy has (a bit grudgingly, at times) addressed most
of these wishes.
<p>

It is still possible to get a kevent file descriptor by opening
<tt>/dev/kevent</tt>, though that is no longer the only way.  The
<tt>kevent_ctl()</tt> system call is still used for the management of
events:
<p>
<pre>
    int kevent_ctl(int fd, unsigned int cmd, unsigned int num, 
                   struct ukevent *arg);
</pre>
<p>
With <tt>kevent_ctl()</tt>, an application can add requests for events,
remove them, or modify them in place.  There is a new
<tt>KEVENT_CTL_READY</tt> operation which can be used to mark specific
events as being "ready" and cause the kernel to wake up one or more
processes waiting for events.
<p>

The synchronous interface has been changed slightly:
<p>
<pre>
    int kevent_get_events(int ctl_fd, unsigned int min_nr, 
                          unsigned int max_nr, struct timespec timeout, 
			  struct ukevent *buf, unsigned flags);
</pre>
<p>
The difference is that the timeout value now is a <tt>struct
timespec</tt>.  That value is still interpreted as a relative timeout,
however, unless <tt>flags</tt> contains <tt>KEVENT_FLAGS_ABSTIME</tt>.  In
the latter case, <tt>timeout</tt> is an absolute time, and the code will
print a warning to the effect that Evgeniy was wrong in believing that
nobody would ever want to use absolute times.
<p>

It is expected, however, that performance-aware applications will use the
user-space ring buffer rather than the synchronous interface.  That ring
buffer is still set up with  <tt>kevent_init()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int kevent_init(struct kevent_ring *ring, unsigned int ring_size,
                    unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The file descriptor argument has been removed from this system call;
instead, <tt>kevent_init()</tt> opens a new file descriptor and passes it
back as its return value.  Thus, there is no separate need to open
<tt>/dev/kevent</tt>. 
<p>
The <tt>kevent_ring</tt> structure has changed a bit since it was last
discussed on this page:
<p>
<pre>
    struct kevent_ring
    {
        unsigned int ring_kidx, ring_over;
   	struct ukevent event[0];
    };
</pre>
<p>
The new <tt>ring_over</tt> value counts the number of times that the index
into the ring has wrapped around.  This parameter is used to ensure that
the kernel and the application have the same understanding of the state of
the ring buffer before allowing the application to mark events as being
consumed.  
<p>
Waiting for events to arrive in the ring is done with
<tt>kevent_wait()</tt>, which now looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    int kevent_wait(int ctl_fd, unsigned int num, unsigned int old_uidx, 
 	            struct timespec timeout, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Here, too, the timeout value is a <tt>struct timespec</tt>, and, once
again, absolute timeouts must be marked with the
<tt>KEVENT_FLAGS_ABSTIME</tt> flag.  This call will wait until at least
one event is ready, then copy up to <tt>num</tt> events into the ring
buffer.  The <tt>old_uidx</tt> is the index of the last event that the
calling application knows about; if more events are added between when the
application checks and when it calls <tt>kevent_wait()</tt>, that call will
return immediately.
<p>
In older versions of the patch, there was no way to tell the kernel when
events had been consumed out of the ring; one simply had to hope this had
happened by the time the index wrapped around and events were overwritten.
In the new version, instead, the application's current position is tracked,
and the kernel should be occasionally informed when entries in the ring
buffer are freed.  That job is done with <tt>kevent_commit()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int kevent_commit(int ctl_fd, unsigned int new_idx, unsigned int over);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>new_idx</tt> is the index of the last event which has been
consumed by the application.  The value for <tt>over</tt> should
be the <tt>ring_over</tt> field from the <tt>kevent_ring</tt> structure.
If that value does not match what the kernel thinks it should be, the
attempt to update the index will fail on the assumption that the calling
process got scheduled out for a while and things happened while it was not
looking.  If this check were not made, confusion over index wraparound
could cause events to be lost.
<p>
As of this writing, the most significant <a
href="/Articles/213681/">comment</a> is that the name "kevent" suggests an
in-kernel API.  The commenter (Jeff Garzik) prefers a name like "uevent"
(even though there is already a subsystem which returns "uevents" in the
kernel).  If that remains the most substantial criticism, the kevent code
might find its way into the mainline long before Evgeniy breaks the devfs
record.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>That's up to application developers to decide. May be 10 or 20 years from now, but not "any time soon". epoll is part of public kernel API - it must work "forever" (or at least for a <b>very</b> long time) even if there are better alternatives. Think about OSS vs ALSA...</p>

      Well, it looks like epoll quite a lot, so I'm wondering why they didn't try to improve and extend epoll instead of adding kevent. For networking epoll is great, and it will stay one way or the other. If kevent turns out to be good then epoll will most likely be built on top of it, instead of being removed.<br>
<p>
"And he has pushed strongly for timeout values to be represented in an absolute format."<br>
<p>
Absolute versus relative? Because I think relative timeouts are at least as useful or better than absolute ones. Just imagine all those applications stopping to work when the clock is set back... That said, using struct timeval as input might fit better with gettimeofday usage.<br>

      After casually looking at a few iterations of this but trying to figure it out, I hate ths secondary ring buffer API.  It's fugly, I can't tell from the writeup if it actually saves any copies, and now it takes *two* syscalls per loop (a commit and a wait) to process more data.  Ugggh!<br>
<p>
It reeks of premature, wanna-be optimization. <br>
<p>
 I really hope they just go with the synchronous API and let non-trivial apps people beat on it a while.<br>

      <p> I completely agree, it's not like doing one syscall and copying the events is the big speed problem. Ulrich seems to be pushing it to be even more fugly just so it works "well" with multiple threads all competing for the same events ... yeh, like I'd trust anyone to get the data access right if they are doing that.</p>
<p> But whatever, if the kernel guys want to include a big POS for slow unstable apps. I'll happily just use the sane API with multiple processes.

      Is the absolute time <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME</tt> or <tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt>? If the 
former...ugh...it's useless; I could see why Evgeniy didn't want it.

If the latter, it can provide more precise timing for those who worry about that sort of thing. 
That group notably includes the designers of pthread_cond_timedwait(). A couple manpage 
snippets:

<blockquote>
<p>
       If the Clock Selection option  is  supported,  the  condition  variable
       shall  have  a  clock attribute which specifies the clock that shall be
       used to measure the time specified by the abstime argument.  When  such
       timeouts  occur, pthread_cond_timedwait() shall nonetheless release and
       re-acquire the mutex referenced by mutex. The  pthread_cond_timedwait()
       function is also a cancellation point.

<p>
       ...

<p>
       An absolute time measure was chosen for specifying the timeout  parameter  for  two  
reasons.  First,  a  relative time measure can be easily
       implemented on top of a function  that  specifies  absolute  time,  but
       there  is a race condition associated with specifying an absolute timeout on top of a function 
that specifies relative timeouts.   For  example, assume that clock_gettime() returns the current 
time and cond_relative_timed_wait() 
uses relative timeouts:

<pre>
              clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;now)
              reltime = sleep_til_this_absolute_time -now;
              cond_relative_timed_wait(c, m, &amp;reltime);
</pre>

<p>
       If the thread is preempted between the first  statement  and  the  last
       statement, the thread blocks for too long. Blocking, however, is irrelevant if an absolute 
timeout is used. An absolute timeout also need not
       be  recomputed  if  it  is  used multiple times in a loop, such as that
       enclosing a condition wait.

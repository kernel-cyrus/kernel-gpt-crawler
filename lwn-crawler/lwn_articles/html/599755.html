           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 21, 2014</br>
           </div>
Much of the recent <a href="/Articles/595565/">discussion</a> regarding the
Ktap dynamic tracing system was 
focused on the addition of a Lua interpreter and virtual machine to the
kernel.  Virtual machines seem like an inappropriate component to be
running in kernel space.
But, in truth, the kernel already contains more than one virtual
machine.  One of those, the BPF interpreter, has been growing in features
and performance; it now looks to be taking on roles beyond its original
purpose.  In the process, it may result in a net reduction in interpreter
code in the kernel.
<p>
"BPF" originally stood for "Berkeley packet filter"; it got its start as a
simple language for writing packet-filtering code for utilities like
<tt>tcpdump</tt>.  Support for BPF in Linux was added by Jay Schulist
for the 2.5 development kernel; for most
of the time since then, the BPF interpreter has been relatively static,
seeing only a 
few performance tweaks and the addition of a few instructions for access to
packet data.  Things started to change in the 3.0 release, when Eric
Dumazet <a href="/Articles/437981/">added a just-in-time compiler</a> to
the BPF interpreter.  In the 3.4 kernel, the "secure computing" (seccomp)
facility 
was <a href="/Articles/475043/">enhanced</a> to support a user-supplied
filter for system calls; that filter, too, is written in the BPF language.
<p>
The 3.15 kernel sees another significant change in BPF.  The language has
now been split into two variants, "classic BPF" and "internal BPF".  The
latter expands the set of available registers from two to ten, adds a
number of instructions that closely match real hardware instructions,
implements 64-bit registers, makes
it possible for BPF programs to call a (rigidly controlled) set of kernel
functions, and more.  Internal BPF is more readily compiled into fast
machine code and makes it easier to hook BPF into other subsystems.
<p>
For now, at least, internal BPF is entirely hidden from user space.  The
packet filtering and secure computing interfaces still accept programs in
the classic BPF language; these programs are translated into internal BPF
before their first execution.  The idea seems to be that internal BPF is a
kernel-specific implementation detail that might change over time, so
chances are it will not be exposed to user space anytime soon.  That said,
the <a href="/Articles/593476/#internals">documentation</a> for internal
BPF indicates that one of the goals of the 
project is to be easier for compilers like GCC and LLVM to generate.
Given that any developer attempting to embed LLVM into the kernel has a
rather small chance of success, that suggests that there may eventually be
a way to load internal BPF directly from user space.
<p>
This latter-day work has been done by Alexei Starovoitov, who looks set to
continue improving BPF going forward.  In 3.15, the just-in-time compiler
only understands the classic BPF instruction set; in 3.16, it will be
ported over to the internal format instead.  Also, for the first time, the
secure computing subsystem will be able to take advantage of the
just-in-time compiler, speeding the execution of sandboxed programs
considerably.
<p>
Sometime after 3.16, use of BPF may be extended further beyond
the networking subsystem.  Alexei recently posted <a
href="/Articles/598545/">a patch</a> that uses BPF for tracing filters.
This is an interesting change that deletes almost as much code as it adds
while improving performance considerably.
<p>
The kernel's tracepoint mechanism allows a suitably privileged user to
receive detailed tracing information every time execution hits a specific
tracepoint in the kernel.  As one might imagine, the amount of data that
results from some tracepoints can be quite large.  The NSA might be able to
process such fire-hose-like streams at its new data center (once it's
running), but many of the rest of us are likely to want to thin that stream
down to something a bit more manageable.  That is where the filtering
mechanism comes in.
<p>
Filters allow the association of boolean expression with any given
tracepoint; the tracepoint only fires if the expression evaluates to true
at execution time.  An example given in <a
href="/Articles/599766/">Documentation/trace/events.txt</a> reads like this:
<p>
<pre>
    # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/signal/signal_generate
    # echo "((sig &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; sig &lt; 15) || sig == 17) &amp;&amp; comm != bash" &gt; filter
</pre>
<p>
With this filter in place, the <tt>signal_generate</tt> tracepoint will
only fire if the specific signal being generated is within the given range
and the process generating the signal is not running <tt>bash</tt>.
<p>
Within the tracing subsystem, an expression like the above is parsed and
represented as a simple tree with each internal node representing one of
the operators.  Every time that the tracepoint is encountered, that tree
will be walked to evaluate each operation with the specific data values
present at the time; should the result be true at the top of the tree, the
tracepoint fires and the relevant information is emitted.  In other words,
the tracing subsystem contains a small parser and interpreter of its own,
used for this one specific purpose.
<p>
Alexei's patch leaves the parser in place, but removes the interpreter.
Instead, the predicate tree produced by the parser is translated into an
internal BPF program, then discarded.  The BPF is translated to machine
code by the just-in-time compiler; the result is then run whenever the
tracepoint is encountered.  From the benchmarks posted by Alexei with the
patch, the result is worth the effort: the execution time for most filters
is reduced by a factor of approximately twenty — and sometimes quite a bit
more.  Given that the overhead of tracing can often hide the very problems
that tracing is being used to find, a huge reduction in that overhead can
only be welcome.
<p>
The patch set was indeed welcomed, but it is unlikely to find its way into
the 3.16 kernel.  It currently depends on the other 3.16 changes, which are
merged into the net-next tree; that tree is not normally used as a
dependency for changes elsewhere in the kernel.  As a result, merging
Alexei's changes into the tracing tree creates compilation failures — an
unwelcome result.
<p>
The root problem here is that the BPF code, showing its origins, is buried
deeply within the networking subsystem.  But usage of BPF is no longer
limited to networking code; it is being employed in core kernel subsystems
like secure computing and tracing as well.  So the time has come for BPF to
move into a more central location where it can be maintained independently
of the networking code.  This change is likely to involve more than just a
simple file move; there is still a lot of networking-specific code in the
BPF interpreter that probably needs to be factored out.  It will be a bit
of work, but that is normal for a subsystem that is being evolved into a
more generally useful facility.
<p>
Until that work is done, BPF-related changes to non-networking code are
going to be difficult to merge.
So <i>that</i> is the logical next step if BPF is to become the primary
virtual machine for interpreted code loaded into the kernel.  It makes
sense to have only one such machine that, presumably, is well debugged and
maintained.  There are no other credible contenders for that role, so BPF
is almost certainly it, once it has been repackaged as a utility for the
whole kernel to use.  After that happens, it will be interesting to see
what other users for BPF come out of the woodwork.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

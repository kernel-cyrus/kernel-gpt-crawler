<p>
  If your software deals with untrusted user input,
  it's a good idea to run a fuzzer against the program.  For the Linux
  kernel, the most 
  effective fuzzer of recent years has
  been Dave Jones's
  <a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/">Trinity</a> system call
  tester.   But there's a new system call fuzzer in town, Dmitry Vyukov's
  <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">syzkaller</a>, and early
  results from it look promising &mdash;
  <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/wiki/Found-Bugs">over 150
  bugs</a> uncovered in the mainline kernel (plus several dozen in Google's
  internal 
  kernels) in a few months of operation.
</p>
<h4>Fuzzing in user space</h4>
<p>
  The basic idea of fuzzing &mdash; feeding huge numbers of random inputs into
  a program and watching for crashes &mdash; has been around for a long time,
  but a naive implementation that just blindly emits random data is too
  inefficient to find all but the most shallow bugs.  One technique for
  finding deeper bugs is to use a "template-based" fuzzer, which generates
  input variations from 
  built-in knowledge about the possible/valid patterns (i.e. templates) for
  the program under 
  test &mdash; information that needs to be manually created for each
  particular target (or class of targets).
</p>
<p>
  However, more recently, "coverage-guided" fuzzers have appeared,
  notably
  Michał Zalewski's
  <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">american fuzzy lop</a>
  (which LWN <a href="/Articles/657959/">covered</a> back in September)
  and Clang's
  <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">LibFuzzer</a>, which operate
  without target-specific templates.  Instead, these fuzzers work with an
  instrumented build of the binary under test, so that code coverage
  information is exposed.  The fuzzer tries to maximize the amount of code
  covered (building an ever-expanding corpus of test inputs along the way), by
  mutating existing inputs and saving anything that hits new code.
</p>
<p>
  As well as detecting out-and-out crashes, fuzzers also work well in
  combination with tools that expose latent bugs, such as Clang's
  sanitizers &mdash; compiler options that add instrumentation to the generated
  code so that incorrect behavior generates an error at run-time:
<ul class="spacylist">
  <li><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a>
    (ASAN), which detects memory access errors.</li>
  <li><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html">ThreadSanitizer</a>
    (TSAN), which detects data races between different threads.</li>
  <li><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">MemorySanitizer</a>
    (MSAN), which detects uninitialized reads: code whose behavior
    relies on memory contents that have not been initialized to a specific
    value.</li>
  <li><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer</a>
  (UBSAN), which detects the use of various features of C/C++ that are
  explicitly listed as resulting in undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  (Most, but not all, of the sanitizers have been ported from Clang to
  GCC; however, it remains the case that the most useful tools appear first,
  or even exclusively, for Clang/LLVM &mdash; another reason to hope for the
  complete success of the
  <a href="http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/index.php/Main_Page">LLVMLinux</a>
  project.)
</p>

<h4>Fuzzing the kernel</h4>

<p>
  The Linux kernel is certainly a piece of software that is exposed to untrusted
  user input, so it is an important target for fuzzing.  The kernel is also
  sufficiently high-profile that it has been worth writing specific,
  template-based fuzzers for different areas of it, such as the
  <a href="/Articles/637151/">filesystem</a>
  or the
  <a href="/Articles/653382/">perf_event subsystem.</a>
  For the system call interface in general, the
  <a href="/Articles/536173/">Trinity fuzz tester</a>
  is the main tool that is currently used.  It fuzzes the kernel in an
  intelligent way that is driven by per-system call
  <a
  href="https://github.com/kernelslacker/trinity/tree/master/syscalls">templates</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  In recent months, Vyukov and a team from Google have brought
  coverage-guided fuzz testing to the kernel with syzkaller, which uses
  a hybrid approach. As with Trinity, syzkaller relies on
  <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/sys/sys.txt">templates</a> that
  indicate the argument domains for each system call, but it also uses
  feedback from code coverage information to guide the fuzzing.
</p>
<p>
  The need for instrumentation does make syzkaller more complicated to set up
  than Trinity.  To start with, the compiler option to generate the needed
  coverage data 
  has only
  <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc?view=revision&revision=231296">recently</a>
  been added to GCC (as <tt>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc</tt>), so the kernel
  needs to be built with a fresh-from-tip version of GCC.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noting that Jones has
  <a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/2015/05/05/thoughts-feedback-loop-trinity/">considered
  feedback-guided fuzzing</a> for Trinity in the past, but found the coverage tools
  that were available at the time to be too slow.  The Google team behind
  syzkaller is primarily made up of compiler developers rather than kernel
  developers, 
  so they may have an easier job of upgrading the tools to match the task
  in hand.
</p>

<p>
  Another complication is that the coverage data needs to be tracked on a
  per-task basis and 
  exported  from the
  kernel to the outside world (via a debugfs entry at <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kcov</tt>).  The kernel patch to do this, and to invoke the
  relevant compiler options (all under <tt>CONFIG_KCOV</tt>), is currently
  <a href="/Articles/674854/">under discussion</a> but looks
  likely to be merged soon.
</p>

<p>
  As mentioned above, the most effective bug-hunting occurs when the system
  call fuzzing is combined with tools that make latent bugs more
  visible.  The kernel version of AddressSanitizer,
  <a href="/Articles/612153/">KASAN</a>, is the most
  straightforward of the sanitizers to enable (it is already included
  in the kernel as the <tt>CONFIG_KASAN</tt>
  build option), and it's also helpful to
  turn on various kernel debug features that expose incorrect use of internal
  kernel APIs, such as:
</p>

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
  <li><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/Kconfig.debug?v=4.3#L968"><tt>CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING</tt></a>
    to catch potential deadlocks.</li>
  <li><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/Kconfig.debug?v=4.3#L1195"><tt>CONFIG_PROVE_RCU</tt></a>
    to catch potential bugs in RCU-using code.</li>
  <li><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/Kconfig.debug?v=4.3#L1048"><tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP</tt></a>
    to find code that calls potentially-sleeping functions in an atomic section.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Using these options means that errors get emitted for bugs that might
  otherwise pass unnoticed ninety-nine times out of a hundred (but
  which are correspondingly harder to find and fix on the hundredth roll of the
  dice).
</p>
<p>
  With these preliminaries in place, syzkaller can then be run over a set of
  QEMU virtual machines running the instrumented kernel under test.  The
  structure of the various syzkaller processes is described by the diagram
  below, which was taken from the project's documentation (and
  where red 
  text indicates 
  configuration entries).
</p>

<a href="/Articles/677957/">

alt="[syzkaller process structure]" width=600 height=427>
</a>

<h4>The results</h4>

<p>
  To see the results of syzkaller in action, we attempt to reproduce a
  null-dereference bug in System&nbsp;V shared-memory processing that was
  first <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/12/190">reported in October
  2015</a>.  We speed up the process by narrowing the range of system calls
  tested to just those mentioned in that email thread, via
  the <tt>enable_syscalls</tt> parameter in
  syzkaller's <a href="/Articles/677977/">configuration file</a>.
  We also make sure our test kernel is built with full namespace support;
  this allows the fuzzer to run its tests in individual sandboxes that do not interfere with
  each other  (using
  the <tt>dropprivs</tt> configuration flag).
  This is particularly useful when dealing with an interprocess
  resource like shared memory.
</p>
<p>
  While the fuzzer is running, it provides a minimal web server to allow the
  user to see progress.  The main status page displays fuzzing statistics and
  a list of the tested system calls; each of the latter provides links to
  further pages:
</p>
<ul class="spacylist">
  <li>A corpus page showing the sequences of system calls that have been
run that include the given system call. For example, the page for
<tt>remap_file_pages()</tt> might include "shmget-shmat-remap_file_pages" as a
summary of particular sequence of system calls that has been run by
the fuzzer.</li>
  <li>A coverage page that shows which parts of the kernel source code were
    hit (provided that the kernel was configured
    with <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/Kconfig.debug?v=4.3#L120"><tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO</tt></a> and
    <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/addr2line.1.html"><tt>addr2line</tt></a>
    is in the <tt>PATH</tt>), either during the processing of a specific
    corpus input or during all corpus inputs that include the given system call.</li>
  <li>A priority page that shows the biases used when randomly generating
    other system calls to run in combination with the given system call.
These priorities are partly based on compatible argument
types (for example, syzkaller is more likely to combine two system
calls that both take socket file descriptor arguments), and partly
based on the frequency with which particular pairs of system calls
appear in the current corpus (indicating that the pair has been
effective in hitting new code in the past).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  After running for a while, syzkaller generates a
  <a href="/Articles/677978/">report file</a> that
  includes a kernel oops; this file includes a log of the sequences of
  system calls that were being run, together with the log output for a null
  pointer dereference.  Feeding the main fault address from the oops output into
  the <tt>addr2line</tt> tool reveals that the problem is
  in <tt>shm_lock()</tt>, which is being called from <tt>shm_open()</tt> as
  part of 
  processing a <tt>remap_file_pages()</tt> system call.
</p>
<p>
  However, we still have to narrow down the precise sequence that causes the
  problem, as the report file includes 204 distinct sequences of system calls.
  The <tt>syz-repro</tt> tool helps with this process; starting from the
  configuration file and the crash report file, it first narrows down to the
  particular sequence that triggers the crash &mdash; usually one of the few
  immediately preceding the log output.  Next, it repeatedly attempts
  to <i>minimize</i> that particular sequence of system calls, by generating
  simpler versions of the sequence and checking that they still induce a
  crash.
</p>
<p>
  In our example, after a few iterations of <tt>syz-repro</tt>, a fairly short
  sequence of system calls pops out:
</p>
<pre>
    mmap(&amp;(0x7f0000000000)=nil, (0x2000), 0x3, 0x32, \
         0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0)
    r0 = shmget(0x5, (0x2000), 0x200, &amp;(0x7f0000b03000)=nil)
    shmat(r0, &amp;(0x7f0000b03000)=nil, 0x6000)
    shmctl(r0, 0x3, &amp;(0x7f0000000000+0xe4b)={ \
           0x3, &lt;r1=&gt;0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0, 0xffffffffffffffff, \
	   0xffffffffffffffff, 0x1, 0xfa, 0x3, 0xee, 0x10000, 0x6520, \
	   0x5, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0, 0x0})
    shmctl(r0, 0xe, &amp;(0x7f0000000000+0x28f)={ \
           0x1000, &lt;r2=&gt;0xffffffffffffffff, \
	   &lt;r3=&gt;0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0, &lt;r4=&gt;0x0, 0x7, \
	   0x100000000, 0x5, 0x6, 0x0, 0x2, 0x4, &lt;r5=&gt;0x0, \
	   0xffffffffffffffff, 0xef0})
    shmctl(r0, 0xc, &amp;(0x7f0000002000-0x50)={ \
           0x80, r1, r4, r2, r3, 0x7, 0x10000, 0x5, 0xff, 0x80000000, \
	   0x9, 0x3, r5, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x2})
    shmctl(r0, 0x0, &amp;(0x7f0000001000-0x50)={ \
           0x1, 0x0, 0x0, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0, 0x1, 0x5, 0x5059, \
	   0x3, 0x6301, 0x8001, 0xfffffffffffffffd, 0xffffffffffffffff, \
           0x0, 0x6})
    remap_file_pages(&amp;(0x7f0000b03000)=nil, (0x2000), 0x0, 0x7, \
                     0x21dd964cfba54855)
</pre>
<p>
  To confirm that this is a reproducible bug scenario, we feed this system
  call script into
  syzkaller's <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/tools/syz-prog2c/prog2c.go"><tt>syz-prog2c</tt></a>
  utility, which generates a <a href="/Articles/677980">100-line
  program</a> that 
  reproduces the problem on the test kernel.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, a bit of human intervention helps to reduce the size of the
  program further.  Looking at the <tt>shmctl()</tt> invocations, we notice that
  the first two calls are for <tt>IPC_INFO</tt> and <tt>SHM_INFO</tt>, both of
  which read values from the kernel rather than modifying anything.  Next, we
  might also suspect that <tt>SHM_UNLOCK</tt> is a no-op, as nothing has been
  locked.  After removing those calls and their data setup, we are left with
  an extremely short program that does indeed reproduce our null dereference
  (at least for now &mdash;
  a <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1ac0b6dec656f3f7">fix</a>
  is on its way):
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    
    long r[5];
    
    int main()
    {
    	memset(r, -1, sizeof(r));
    	r[0] = syscall(SYS_mmap, 0x20000000ul, 0x2000ul, 0x3ul, 0x32ul,
	               0xfffffffffffffffful, 0x0ul);
    	r[1] = syscall(SYS_shmget, 0x5ul, 0x2000ul, 0x200ul, 0x20b03000ul, 0, 0);
    	r[2] = syscall(SYS_shmat, r[1], 0x20b03000ul, 0x6000ul, 0, 0, 0);
    	r[3] = syscall(SYS_shmctl, r[1], 0x0ul, 0x20000fb0ul, 0, 0, 0);
    	r[4] = syscall(SYS_remap_file_pages, 0x20b03000ul, 0x2000ul,
	               0x0ul, 0x7ul, 0x21dd964cfba54855ul, 0);
    	return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
  Unfortunately, not all problems are as straightforward to reproduce and
  isolate as this one.  Bugs may only be triggered by interactions between
  multiple test programs (when the <tt>procs</tt> configuration option is
    greater than one) if persistent or global resources are involved.  More commonly, bugs may
  only be triggered by interactions between different threads in the same
  program; the fuzzing process deliberately executes system calls in parallel
  across multiple threads &mdash; which increases the chances of finding bugs
  at the cost of making it harder to narrow down the reproduction scenario.
  (Building the kernel
  with <a href="https://github.com/google/ktsan">KTSAN</a> enabled is
  particularly helpful for finding multithreaded problems, as it makes latent
  data races explicitly visible.)
</p>
<p>
  To help with reproduction, syzkaller includes a tool
  (<a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/tools/syz-execprog/execprog.go"><tt>syz-execprog</tt></a>)
  for re-running a crash script under various options.  The <tt>-threaded</tt>
  option governs whether the system call script is run across multiple
  threads, and (if it is) the <tt>-collide</tt> option forces the threads to
  explicitly execute system calls in parallel.  To catch <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">heisenbugs</a>, 
  the <tt>-repeat</tt> option also allows the script to be re-run arbitrarily
  many times.
</p>
<p>
  Although these tools don't guarantee a simple reproduction scenario, they seem
  to be effective in practice &mdash; the majority of the syzkaller-generated
  bug reports have included a short reproducer program, greatly simplifying the
  process of finding and fixing the underlying bug.  The corpus of test
    inputs can be a helpful resource for quick regression 
  testing of new kernel versions.
</p>

<h4>What's next</h4>
<p>
  The syzkaller project is
  under <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/commits">active
  development</a>, so things are moving fast.  As mentioned above, the
  necessary patches for GCC have gone upstream and should appear in the next
  version; the concomitant kernel patch is being discussed.
  Once both are available by default, running syzkaller will only be slightly
  more inconvenient than running Trinity.
</p>
<p>
  Because syzkaller is a hybrid of a template-based and a coverage-guided
  fuzzer, it does work best when provided with information about the usage
  patterns of system calls.  To that end, the syzkaller developers are keen to
  work with kernel developers so that support for particular kernel subsystems
  can be reviewed and extended (which may well involve making the system call
  template mechanisms more sophisticated). They would also like to extend
  architecture support beyond the current somewhat x86_64-specific situation,
  and would like

Impressive work, and thanks for the well-written article!<br>
<p>
Somewhat related, I've also written a code coverage tool called kcov:<br>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov">https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov</a><br>
<p>
which as of now collects code coverage for userspace programs using breakpoints. However, the 'k' in the name  was meant to be 'kernel', and the idea was to use kprobes and debugfs to setup and report breakpoints in the kernel. I never got that working reliably though, so the kernel part has never really been activated. I suppose I should write a backend for CONFIG_KCOV now though :-)<br>

"Impressive work, and thanks for the well-written article!"<br>
<p>
Seconded and given that the author makes a statement like this: "Unfortunately, not all problems are as straightforward to reproduce and isolate as this one. " he clearly knows how to communicate effectively to those with a rather lesser knowledge of these things.<br>
<p>
Great stuff.<br>

It's nice to see the kernel fixes getting in, especially the perf_event ones.<br>
<p>
This tool turned up many of the same remaining open perf_fuzzer-found bugs, but either because the reports are better or else because the maintainers got prodded more, bug-fixing got kicked into high gear.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; To start with, the compiler option to generate the needed coverage data has only recently been added to GCC</font><br>

the gcc-side instrumentation is very simple and could be done from a plugin, thus extending support all the way back to gcc 4.5.<br>

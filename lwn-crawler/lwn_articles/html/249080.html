LWN.net <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2007/">Kernel Summit 2007</a> coverage
</div>
<p>
For the first time in a few years, virtualization was not on the agenda at
the 2007 kernel summit.  The related field of containers, however, was
deemed worth talking about.  The virtualization problem has been mostly
solved, at least at the kernel level, but there is still a lot of work to
do in the containers area.
<p>

Paul Menage talked about the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/236038/">process containers patch</a>, which
has recently been rebranded "control groups."  The control groups API is
currently being used by the CFS scheduler, cpusets, and the memory
controller code.  Work in progress includes rlimits and an interface to the
process freezer used by the suspend/resume code.  Controlling the freezer
via control groups allows user space to freeze specific groups of
processes, which, in turn, is very useful when implementing checkpointing
and live migration.  In particular, with control groups, it will be
possible to freeze an entire group of processes in an atomic way.
<p>

Control groups have very little overhead when not in use.  There is an
approximately 1% hit on the <tt>fork()</tt> and <tt>exec()</tt> calls when
control groups are being used.  The control groups code is managed by way
of a virtual filesystem.  This filesystem is a user-space API which must be
managed carefully; there needs to be consistency across the various
controllers which can work with control groups.  To that end, parts of this
interface are being pushed into generic code when possible.  One other
issue is the use of control groups within containers.  It would be nice if
a containerized system could manage control groups for processes within the
container, but that is not yet implemented.
<p>

Eric Biederman talked about the container situation in general.
Implementing containers requires the creation of container-specific
namespaces for all of the global resources found on the system.  Namespaces
for time, SYSV interprocess communication primitives, and users are in the
mainline now.  There is a process ID namespace patch in -mm which is
getting close.  Network namespaces are in development now.  Resources which
still need to have namespaces created for them include system time
(important to keep time from moving backward when containers are migrated
from one system to another) and devices.
<p>

Each namespace which is created requires an option to the <tt>clone()</tt>
system call to say whether it should be shared or not.  It seems that there
may not be enough clone bits to go around; how that problem will be solved
is not clear.
<p>

So, how close are we to having a working container solution?  It is still
somewhat distant, says Eric.  But, when it's done, the support for
containers in Linux will be more general and more capable than the options
which are available now. It is, he says, a more general solution than
OpenVZ, and, unlike Solaris Zones, it will have network namespaces.  An
important milestone will be the incorporation of PID namespaces, which will
make it possible to start actually playing with Linux containers.  That
code should, with luck, be merged before too long, though it is proving to
be a bit of a challenge: kernel code has process IDs hidden away in a
number of unexpected places.
<p>

Stay tuned; perhaps, by the next kernel summit, containers will be
considered to be a solved problem as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<blockquote>An important milestone will be the incorporation of PID namespaces, which will make it possible to start actually playing with Linux containers. That code should, with luck, be merged before too long</blockquote>

<p>(Most of) PID namespaces code are already in -mm tree.</p>

<blockquote>It is, he says, a more general solution than OpenVZ</blockquote>

Yes, in a sense that one can only use parts of container functionality (like only have a PID namespace, or a network namespace) -- which makes sense in some situations. Currently, OpenVZ kernel only lets you use just some parts separately (like beancounters, or fair CPU scheduler), and this is only from the kernel side -- user-level tools can only deal with "full scale" containers.

From the other side, checkpointing is only possible when container is a closed object, so "half-containers" can not be checkpointed.

<blockquote>So, how close are we to having a working container solution?</blockquote>

<p>A big part here is resource management. Memory controller that is now in -mm is just the very beginning -- there is a whole lot more than RSS and page cache (from the other side, Pavel Emelyanov already sent kernel memory controller patchset as an RFC). Group-based CFQ scheduling is not yet merged AFAIK. Group I/O scheduling (based on Jens Axboe's CFQ) will probably be sent for review soon; but scheduling delayed writes requires some dirty page tracking mechanism that only exists in OpenVZ for now (described in <a href="http://download.openvz.org/~xemul/">Pavel's paper</a>), a discussion of how to implement that for mainstream is not even started.</p>

<p>At the end -- there are a lot of issues to be solved, but given the latest progress, most of the functionality could be there in a year or so, so I more or less agree with your optimistic forecast. :)</p>

<p>When containers are ready, we can start work on checkpointing.</p>

      It's an ability to have different network stacks running along. It's network stack virtualization. And, contrary to comment above, it's available in Solaris 10u4 and OpenSolaris. It's nicknamed <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/">project Crossbow</a>.

      When I claimed the current kernel infrastructure is more general then <br>
vserver and OpenVZ what I meant is that we have to support the entire <br>
kernel and everything it can do, and doing it with code that can pass<br>
a code review by the kernel community.  Ensuring that architecture and<br>
subarchitecture will work, and that every weird kernel subsystem will work<br>
appears to me to be more then the out of tree projects have tackled.<br>
<p>
Doing this this with namespaces makes decomposes the problem so we can <br>
have an incremental merge (simplifying things).  It also makes things a <br>
little harder as we have to handle all of the weird partial interactions.<br>
<p>
The question asked of me is how long until we have in kernel support that <br>
is equal to OpenVZ, or Solaris Zones.  Getting there pretty much requires <br>
us to get everything complete and will take a while.<br>
<p>
If you only need a subset of that functionality (like a lot of projects) <br>
we should have something interesting when the we get things like the pid <br>
namespace merged.<br>
<p>
Having the additional resource management seems to be a big part of the <br>
existing out of tree solutions because when you load the machine heavily <br>
you have more contention between users.  However for some uses like a <br>
better chroot for rpm installs or an isolated set of process for <br>
checkpoint restart you don't need additional resource management.<br>
<p>
<p>
For global resources there are two approaches that a designer can choose <br>
from.  Namespaces where you allow two instances of the same global name to <br>
exist in different namespaces.  Pure isolation (which is almost <br>
exclusively what vserver provides) which only allows you to see a subset <br>
of the global names.   If you are not supporting process migration they <br>
are about the same.  Without namespaces process migration is in trouble <br>
because there is no guarantee that you can restore your global identifiers <br>
and keep running.<br>
<p>
<p>
What little I know of Solaris Zones is that they grew out of efforts to <br>
improve chroot type solutions, and thus do primarily global resource <br>
isolation and do not provide namespaces.  The implication of that is that<br>
Solaris Zones do not provide an easy path to container migration from one <br>
machine to another.  However everything is evolving and even if my <br>
understanding was right at one time, Solaris may have changed since then. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
As for the question of what are network namespaces.  They are a way to <br>
make it appear to user space as if you have multiple network stacks.  Each <br>
logical stack with it's own routing tables, firewall tables, network <br>
devices and the works.  Fundamentally they aren't to hard to implement but <br>
they need a bit of work on how the network stack handles global data.<br>

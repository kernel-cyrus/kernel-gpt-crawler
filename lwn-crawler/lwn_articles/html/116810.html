<h1>Rethinking four-level page tables</h1>

Andi Kleen's four-level page table patch has been in the -mm tree for some
time; it is widely understood to be one of the first things in the queue to
be merged once 2.6.10 is out.  For those who are not familiar with this
patch, why it matters, and how it works, a look at <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/106177/">this LWN Kernel Page article from
last October</a> might be helpful in understanding the following
discussion. 
<p>


The three levels of page table currently implemented by the kernel are,
from top to bottom, the PGD, PMD, and PTE.  Andi's patch extends the
hierarchy by adding a new top-level directory called PML4 (from the x86-64
specification).  A system which currently has a single PGD (per virtual
address space) will have, instead, a single PML4 directory which may
contain pointers to many PGD directories.  In the current implementation,
the PMD vanishes transparently on systems which only have two-level page
tables; as a result, the kernel can treat all systems as if they had
three-level page tables.  Andi's four-level patch works in a similar way,
causing the new PML4 level to be optimized out on hardware which does not
support it.
<p>

Nick Piggin has recently posted <a href="/Articles/116541/">a new,
alternative four-level patch</a>.  Nick is not hugely upset by Andi's patch
set, but he thinks he has a better way.  Essentially, Nick thinks that it
would be better to keep the PGD as the top-level page directory, and to
insert the new level in the middle, next to the PMD.  With this
organization, all architectures would have an active PGD at the top of the
hierarchy, and active PTEs at the bottom, but the PMD and the PUD (Nick's
name for the new level) would be optimized out on systems which do not use
them. 
<p>

Andi <a href="/Articles/116815/">would prefer to stick with the current</a>
patches; he sees Nick's approach as being mainly an exercise in renaming
which could delay the merging of the four-level capability.  The current
patches have been shaken down well in the -mm tree and seem to work;
thrashing them up now would require a new round of testing before they had
the same level of confidence.  Andi has other work which is waiting for the
four-level patch to be merged, so he would rather not see the whole process
slowed down.

<p>
Others are in less of a hurry, however, and see merit in Nick's patches.
In particular, Linus <a href="/Articles/116817/">prefers placing the new
level below the PGD</a> as the least intrusive way of extending the page
table hierarchy.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Basically, by doing the new folded table in the middle, it _only_
	affects code that actually walks the page tables. Basically, what I
	wanted in the original 2-&gt;3 level expansion was that people who
	don't use the new level should be able to conceptually totally
	ignore it. I think that is even more true in the 3-&gt;4 level
	expansion.
</div>
<p>

Andi has not yet given in, but there seems to be a strong wind blowing in
favor of Nick's page table arrangement.  So four-level page tables might
not be the first thing to go into 2.6.11 after all.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

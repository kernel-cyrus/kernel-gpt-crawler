The kernel cannot be said to lack for memory allocation mechanisms.  At the
lowest level, "memblock" handles chunks of memory for the rest of the
system.  The page allocator provides memory to the rest of the kernel in
units of whole pages.  Much of the kernel uses one of the three slab
allocators to get memory blocks in arbitrary sizes, but there is also
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> for situations where large, virtually-contiguous regions
are needed.  Add in various other specialized allocation functions and
other allocators (like <a href="/Articles/447405/">CMA</a>) and it starts
to seem like a true embarrassment of choices.  So what's to be done in this
situation?  Add another one, of course.
<p>
The "zsmalloc" allocator, <a href="/Articles/474880/">proposed</a> by Seth
Jennings, is aimed at a specific use case.  The slab allocators work by
packing multiple objects into each page of memory; that works well when the
objects are small, but can be problematic as they get larger.  In the worst
case, if a kernel subsystem routinely needs allocations that are just
larger than PAGE_SIZE/2, only one object will fit within a page.  Slab
allocators can attempt to allocate multiple physically-contiguous pages in
order to pack those large objects more efficiently, but, on
memory-constrained systems, those allocations can become difficult - or
impossible.  So, on systems that are already tight of memory, large objects
will need to be allocated one-per-page, wasting significant amounts of
memory through internal fragmentation.
<p>
The zsmalloc allocator attempts to address this problem by packing objects
into a new type of compound page where the component pages are not
physically contiguous.  The result can be much more efficient memory usage,
but with some conditions: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> Code using this allocator must not require physically-contiguous
     memory,
<p>
<li> Objects must be explicitly mapped before use, and
<p>
<li> Objects can only be accessed in atomic context.
</ul>
<p>
Code using zsmalloc must start by creating an allocation pool to work from:
<p>
<pre>
    struct zs_pool *zs_create_pool(const char *name, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>name</tt> is the name of the pool, and <tt>flags</tt> will be
used to allocate memory for the pool.  It is not entirely clear (to your
editor, at least) why multiple pools exist; the <tt>zs_pool</tt> structure
is relatively large, and a pool is really only efficient if the number of
objects allocated from it is also large.  But that's how the API is
designed.
<p>
A pool can be released with:
<p>
<pre>
    void zs_destroy_pool(struct zs_pool *pool);
</pre>
<p>
A warning (or several warnings) will be generated if there are objects
allocated from the pool that have not been freed; those objects will become
entirely inaccessible after the pool is gone.
<p>
Allocating and freeing memory is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *zs_malloc(struct zs_pool *pool, size_t size);
    void zs_free(struct zs_pool *pool, void *obj);
</pre>
<p>
The return value from <tt>zs_malloc()</tt> will be a pointer value, or NULL
if the object cannot be allocated.  It would be a fatal mistake, though, to
treat that pointer as if it were actually a pointer; it is actually a magic
cookie that represents the allocated memory indirectly.  It might have been
better to use a non-pointer type, but, again, that is how the API is
designed.  Getting a pointer that can actually be used is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *zs_map_object(struct zs_pool *pool, void *handle);
    void zs_unmap_object(struct zs_pool *pool, void *handle);
</pre>
<p>
The return value from zs_map_object() will be a kernel virtual address that
can be used to access the actual object.  The return address is essentially
a per-CPU object, so the calling code will be in
atomic context until the object is freed with <tt>zs_unmap_object()</tt>.
Note that the <tt>handle</tt> passed to <tt>zs_unmap_object()</tt> is the
original cookie obtained from <tt>zs_malloc()</tt>, not the pointer from
<tt>zs_map_object()</tt>.  Note also that only one object can be safely
mapped at a time on any given CPU.
<p>
Internally, zsmalloc divides allocations by object size much like the slab
allocators do, but with a much higher granularity - there are 254 possible
allocation sizes all less than <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt>.  For each size, the code
calculates an optimum number of pages (up to 16) that will hold an array of
objects of that size with minimal loss to fragmentation.  When an
allocation is made, a "zspage" is created by allocating the calculated
number of individual pages and tying them all together.  That tying is done
by overloading some fields of <tt>struct page</tt> in a scary way (that is
not a criticism of zsmalloc: <i>any</i> additional meanings overlaid onto
the already heavily overloaded <tt>page</tt> structure are scary):
<p>
<ul>
<li> The first page of a zspage has the <tt>PG_private</tt> flag set.  The
     <tt>private</tt> field points to the second page (if any), while the
     <tt>lru</tt> list structure is used to make a list of zspages of the
     same size.
<p>
<li> Subsequent pages are linked to each other with the <tt>lru</tt>
     structure, and are linked back to the first page with the
     <tt>first_page</tt> field (which is another name for <tt>private</tt>,
     if one looks at the structure definition).
<p>
<li> The last page has the <tt>PG_private_2</tt> flag set.
</ul>
<p>
Within a zspage, objects are packed from the beginning, and may cross the
boundary between pages.  The cookie returned from <tt>zs_malloc()</tt> is a
combination of a pointer to the <tt>page</tt> structure for the first
physical page and the offset of the object within the zspage.  Making that
object accessible to the rest of the kernel at mapping time is a matter of
calculating its location, then either (1)&nbsp;mapping it with
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> if the object fits entirely within one physical
page, or (2)&nbsp;assigning a pair of virtual addresses if the object
crosses a physical page boundary.
<p>
The primary users of zsmalloc are the zcache and zram mechanisms, both of which are
currently in staging.  These subsystems use the <a
href="/Articles/454795/">transcendent memory</a> abstraction to store
compressed copies of pages in memory.  Those compressed pages can still be
a substantial fraction of the (uncompressed) page size, so fragmentation
issue addressed by zsmalloc can be a real problem.  Given the specialized
use case and the limitation imposed by zsmalloc, it is not clear that it
will find users elsewhere in the kernel, but one never knows.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just wanted to add that the primary designer and author of the zsmalloc allocator is Nitin Gupta.  I (Seth) helped with design/bug fixes and submitted the patches since his changes and mine had dependencies.<br>

Why can't we maintain a single free list for all free objects in pool of zspage's instead of maintaining a separate freelist for each zspages. I mean to say that if we maintain a single free list then it would be easy for us to allocate objects from freelist instead of looKing for freelist among zspages.<br>

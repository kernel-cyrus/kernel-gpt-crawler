<h1>The ZUFS zero-copy filesystem</h1>

<p>
At the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit
(LSFMM), Boaz Harrosh presented his zero-copy user-mode filesystem (ZUFS).
It is both a filesystem in its own right and a framework similar to FUSE for
implementing filesystems in user space.  It is geared toward extremely low latency and
high performance, particularly for systems using persistent memory.
</p>

<p>
Harrosh began by saying that the idea behind his talk is to hopefully
entice others into helping out with ZUFS.  There are lots of "big iron
machines" these days, some with extremely fast I/O paths (e.g. NVMe over
fabrics with throughput higher than memory).  "For some reason" there may be
a need to run a filesystem in user space but the current interface is slow
because "everyone is copy happy", he said.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Al Viro asked if Harrosh had looked at <a
href="/Articles/643165/">OrangeFS</a>, which can share its pages with a
user-space component.  Harrosh said that he had worked with OrangeFS in the
past, but that it has "nowhere near the performance" he is seeking.

<p>
He is focused on copies.  If a system mainly uses NVDIMMs (i.e. persistent
memory), the memory 
bandwidth should be used for storage.  So ZUFS is "very strict that nothing
is copied anywhere".  Anything that can be accessed via a pointer to
persistent memory will be; "even metadata is zero copy".
</p>

<p>
He showed some system diagrams of ZUFS that are similar to those in his
2017 Linux Plumbers Conference <a
href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2017/ocw//system/presentations/4703/original/ZUFS_for_LinuxPlumbers_LPC.pptx">slides
[<tt>.pptx</tt>]</a>.  There is one kernel component, the ZU Feeder (ZUF),
that feeds remote procedure calls (RPCs) from applications to the ZU Server
(ZUS), which lives in user space.  ZUS can have various <tt>.so</tt> files
linked to it that implement different filesystems using the framework; some
of those might be proprietary.  ZUF is released under the GPL, while ZUS is
BSD licensed.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple ZUFS threads (ZTs), each with an affinity to a single core.
Each ZT is dedicated to a particular application; there is no shared
information between the ZTs and ZUS, so no locks are needed.  A 4MB per-CPU
zero-copy region (ZT-vma) is shared between the application and the ZT, so each
CPU has its own area that can be used to communicate between the server
and the application.
</p>

<p>
For a write operation, the application maps its buffers into its per-CPU
ZT-vma and initiates the operation.  ZT gets the pointer and length and 
does a <tt>memcpy()</tt> from the ZT-vma data to persistent memory.  For
a read, the application maps buffers to hold the data and a ZT fills them from
the persistent memory.  It supports multiple applications, with "not a lock
in sight".
</p>

<p>
The in-kernel portion of ZUFS includes a ZUF-root, which is a
mini-filesystem that allows the normal <tt>mount</tt> command to be used.
The kernel will have knowledge of the filesystem types and mounts, but the filesystems
are really mounted in user space.   ZUS is a thin layer that implements VFS
operations.  It uses direct I/O by default, but can optionally use the page cache.
</p>

<p>
ZUFS is a zero-copy replacement for FUSE.  It sacrifices some of the
security of FUSE because it does not have a server per filesystem, but the
API for ZUFS is simpler than FUSE.  It also does not rely on copying, as
FUSE does, of course.
</p>

<p>
He was looking for feedback, but a whirlwind tour of a new filesystem with a
lot of differences from the usual fare may have been a bit overwhelming;
there were not too many comments on any "big holes" that attendees saw.  He
said that there is a complete filesystem implementation at this point, only
missing extended attributes (xattrs) and access-control lists (ACLs); it
can run xfstests and is "pretty stable".  It does, however, take some
shortcuts; that means the server has a lot of ways to crash the kernel,
which Viro called a "non-starter" in terms of getting it merged.

      Why would anyone use ZUFS since there is a persistent memory filesystem available that is simpler and that performs significantly better, namely <a href="https://www.usenix.org/node/194455">NOVA</a>?

IMO, the interesting bit here is the zero-copy, fast transport between userland and kernel. Layering this on top of pmem is neat (and fits Boaz requirements), but a lot of the concepts that Boaz is using here could make for a potential foundation for a better-performing replacement for FUSE.<br>

Can this be leveraged to enable faster netfs in userspace?<br>
<p>
As a remote filesystem you pretty much need to be in the kernel proper to get any kind of resonable performance. FUSE works if you're in a pinch, but not performance needed for any kind of production work. Some of the netfs can perform their transfers over RDMA.<br>
<p>
I know this is not the case environed, some filesystems might still need a caching on the client side. But there's no reason a caching solution cannot be developed in userspace and then shared via memory in a zero-copy like fashion.<br>
<p>
The current requirement of putting the netfs in the kernel has a lot of costs in terms of maintance and just general complexity.<br>

           </div>
Tracepoints are small hooks placed into kernel code; when they are enabled,
they can generate event information which can be consumed through the
ftrace or perf interfaces.  These tracepoints are defined via the decidedly
gnarly <tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> macro which Steven Rostedt nicely <a
href="/Articles/379903/">described in detail</a> for LWN earlier this
year.  As kernel developers add more tracepoints to the kernel, they are
occasionally finding things which can be improved.  One of those seems
relatively simple: what if a tracepoint should only fire some of the time?
<p>
Arjan van de Ven recently posted <a href="/Articles/417774/">a patch adding
a tracepoint</a> to <tt>__mark_inode_dirty()</tt>, a function called deep
within the virtual filesystem layer to, surprisingly, mark an inode as
being dirty.  Arjan's purpose is to figure out which processes are causing
files to have dirty contents; that will allow tools like PowerTop to tell
laptop users which process is causing their disk to spin up.  The only
problem is that some calls to <tt>__mark_inode_dirty()</tt> are essentially
noise from this point of view; they happen, for example, when an inode is
first created or is being freed.  Tracing those calls could create a stream
of useless events which would have to be filtered out by PowerTop, causing
PowerTop itself to require more power.  So it is preferable to avoid
creating those events in the first place if possible.
<p>
For that reason, Arjan made the call to the tracepoint be
conditional:
<p>
<pre>
    if (flags &amp; (I_DIRTY_SYNC | I_DIRTY_DATASYNC | I_DIRTY_PAGES))
	trace_writeback_inode_dirty(inode, flags);
</pre>
<p>
This code works in that it causes the tracepoint to be "hit" only when an
application has actually done something to dirty an inode.
<p>
The VFS developers seem to have no objection to this tracepoint being
added; the resulting information can be useful.  But they didn't like the
conditional nature of it.  Part of the problem is that tracepoints are
supposed to keep a low profile; developers want to be able to ignore them
most of the time.  Expanding a tracepoint to two lines and an <tt>if</tt>
statement rather defeats that goal.  But tracepoints are also supposed to
not affect execution time.  They have been carefully coded to impose almost
no overhead when they are not enabled (which is most of the time); with
techniques like <a href="/Articles/412072/">jump label</a>, that overhead
can be reduced even further.  But that <tt>if</tt> statement, being outside
of the tracepoint altogether, will always be executed regardless of whether
the tracepoint is currently enabled or not.  Multiply that test-and-jump
across millions of calls to <tt>__mark_inode_dirty()</tt> on each of
millions of machines, and the extra CPU cycles start to add up.
<p>
So it was asked: could this test be moved into the tracepoint
itself?  One approach might be to put the test into the
<tt>TP_fast_assign()</tt> portion of the tracepoint, which copies the
tracepoint data into the tracing ring buffer.  The problem with that idea
is that, by that time, the tracepoint has already fired, space has been
allocated in the ring buffer, etc.  There is currently no mechanism to
cancel a tracepoint hit partway through.  There has, in the past, been
talk of adding some sort of "never mind" operation which could be invoked
within <tt>TP_fast_assign()</tt>, but that idea seems less than entirely
elegant. 
<p>
What might happen, instead, is the creation of a variant of
<tt>TRACE_EVENT()</tt> with a name like <tt>TRACE_EVENT_CONDITION()</tt>.
It would take an extra parameter which would be, of course, another tricky
macro.  For Arjan's tracepoint, the condition would look something like:
<p>
<pre>
    TP_CONDITION(
	    if (flags &amp; (I_DIRTY_SYNC | I_DIRTY_DATASYNC | I_DIRTY_PAGES))
	    	return 1;
	    else
	    	return 0;
    ),
</pre>
<p>
The tracepoint code would then test the condition before doing any other
work associated with the tracepoint - but only if the tracepoint itself has
been enabled.  
<p>
This solution should help to keep the impact of tracepoints to a minimum
once again, especially when those tracepoints are not enabled.  There is
one potential problem in that the condition is now hidden deeply within the
definition of the tracepoint; that definition is usually found in a special
header file far from the code where the tracepoint is actually inserted.
At the tracepoint itself, the condition which might cause it not to fire is
not visible in any way.  So, if somebody other than the initial developer
wants to use the tracepoint, they could misinterpret a lack of output as a
sign that the surrounding code is not being executed at all.  That little
problem could presumably be worked around with clever tracepoint naming,
better documentation, or simply expecting users to understand what
tracepoints are actually telling them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
It does make me wonder why the filtering logic couldn't just be in PowerTop, as having the tracepoint on is clearly not the normal case.  I assume that it would have generated enough extra work and really changed the systems power usage enough to make PowerTop's analysis harder.<br>

The people using the tracepoints are not necessarily kernel developers, and in most cases will not be tracing while at the same time looking at the source-code.<br>

<h1>Memory-management documentation and development process</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 2, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
As the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> neared its conclusion, two sessions
were held in the memory-management track on process-oriented topics.  Mike
Rapoport ran a session on memory-management documentation (or the lack
thereof), while Andrew Morton talked about the state of the subsystem's
development process in general. Both sessions were relatively brief and did
not foreshadow substantial changes to come.
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>
Rapoport started by saying that documentation has become an annual topic.
There has been some big progress since <a href="/Articles/894374/">last year's
session</a>, he said: Matthew Wilcox had added a table of contents to <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/mm/">the memory-management
documentation</a> and Rapoport had contributed "a half chapter".  This
major step forward was greeted with applause from the group.  Taking a more
serious tone, Rapoport
asked for ideas that might lead to a better progress report next year.
<p>
Your editor felt the need to point out that, despite the existence of
thousands of kernel developers who are paid to contribute code, there is not a
single person paid to contribute to the documentation.  Many developers
try, and a fair amount of documentation work gets done, but it almost
always has to be wedged in around the "real" work that people are paid to
do.  As long as that situation persists, it is going to be hard to see
major improvements to the documentation.
Matthew Wilcox commented that this is an example of the sort of
"endemic corporate brokenness" that we see every day.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
Steve Rostedt suggested refusing to accept patches that do not come with
documentation; Rapoport answered that this approach would not help with the
large amount of documentation debt the community has now.  Rostedt said
that some sort of "we'll take this patch after you document that" policy
could be tried, but Pasha Tatashin pointed out that not everybody is a good
writer, and the results from such a policy might not be to the community's
liking.
<p>
Lorenzo Stoakes said that writers also have to be engineers to do the job
properly.  Vlastimil Babka pointed out that companies like to have nice
technical blogs, and that perhaps some of the energy that goes in that
direction could be put into creating documentation.  SeongJae Park
suggested using ChatGPT.  But nobody seemed to have any ideas that would
substantially improve the situation.
<p>
As the session came to its end, Rapoport was asked where the documentation
is most in need of improvement; he answered that potential contributors should
find an interesting empty spot in the current table of contents and fill it
in.
<p>
Since the end of the conference, Stoakes, who is working on a book about
Linux memory management, has <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/CAA5enKY+cGjA53B4iVtKtib2=SVWNij80j+gi5U_qDN7Qf9AAA@mail.gmail.com/">offered</a>
to contribute parts of it to the kernel's documentation.  That discussion
has just begun, but it may well lead to some significant contributions in
the near future.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/932404/"><img

title="Andrew Morton" class="rthumb"></a>

<h4>The state of the community</h4>
<p>

The final scheduled session in the memory-management track was the
traditional discussion with maintainer Andrew Morton about the state of the
community as a whole.  He didn't have much to say.  Everything that he <a
href="/Articles/894378/">proposed last year</a>, including a move to using
Git and changing how patches are handled on their way to the mainline, is
working as intended.  The mm-stable subtree, perhaps, is the least
successful part, just because patches take a long time to stabilize.  In
response, he is becoming more active about hurrying people along.  He has
also started putting some of the less-finished patches into mm-stable to
give them more stability.
<p>
When asked if he planned to kill mm-stable, the answer was "no", but he'll
try to move stuff out of the unstable tree more quickly.  There is a lot
that goes into the stable tree during the last week of the development
cycle, which is not ideal, he said.

<p>
Michal Hocko said that he likes how the process has changed over the last
year.  It is much more transparent and a step in the right direction.
Nobody else had much to add, so the session came to a close after just a
few minutes.

Perhaps this is because people are not regularly tasked with writing documentation for their code so it is not a skill they hone :)<br>
<p>
Either way, I feel like I would much much rather have badly written documentation (or fix badly written documentation) than no documentation at all, just as long as it isn't actively misleading of course?<br>

There are expectations that those climbing Mt. Everest bring back at least a certain amount of trash (beyond their own) on their way back (I believe implemented via a returnable portion of the permit fee). I don't see how asking for some drive-by doc updates is that much different.<br>

Or even just say you can't land a code upodate without also landing appropriate documentation.<br>
<p>
If the documentation has to document the modified code, plus anything close enough to be needed for understanding, then the documentation coverage will grow faster than the code. You can't ask for much more.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 6, 2023</br>
           </div>
Operating systems have traditionally used all of the memory that the
hardware provides to them.  The advent of virtualization and confidential
computing is changing this picture somewhat, though; the system can now be
more picky about which memory it will use.  Patches to add support for
explicit memory acceptance when running under AMD's <a
href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html">Secure Encrypted
Virtualization and Secure Nested Paging</a> (SEV-SNP), though, have run
into some turbulence over how to handle a backward-compatibility issue.
<p>
Normally, when the operating-system kernel boots, it discovers the
available memory and happily sets itself up to use that memory.  Version
2.9 of the UEFI specification, though, added the concept of unaccepted
memory; when this mechanism is in use, a system (normally a virtualized
guest) will be launched with its memory in an unaccepted state.  That
system will not be able to make use of the memory provided until that
memory has been explicitly accepted.  On such systems, the bootloader will
typically pre-accept enough memory to allow the guest kernel to boot; that
kernel must take responsibility for accepting the rest before using it.
<p>
Documentation on the motivation for this feature is scarce, but there would
appear to be a couple of reasons for the addition of this new complication:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Secure guest environments like SEV-SNP and Intel's TDX can protect
     their memory contents from the host and other guests through
     encryption, reverse-mapping tables, and more.  Setting that protection
     up takes some time, though, slowing the boot process considerably.  An
     explicit acceptance step allows the operating system to spread the
     initialization of memory over time.  If memory is only accepted in
     chunks as it is needed, the system will boot into a running state more
     quickly.  <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230330114956.20342-1-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com/">The
     patches adding unaccepted-memory support</a> from Kirill Shutemov take
     advantage of this by deferring acceptance of memory until it is needed.
<li> Explicit acceptance can help to defend a secure guest from a malicious
     hypervisor that might try to play games with the guest's memory behind
     the scenes.  Should the hypervisor try to sneak a new page into a
     guest's address space, that new memory will not have been accepted by
     the guest and an attempt to access it will generate a fault.
</ul>
<p>
Each vendor's secure environment has its own way of managing the acceptance
process, so some of the code that implements acceptance must necessarily be
specific to one subarchitecture.  Shutemov's patches add support for
Intel's TDX, but support for AMD's SEV-SNP comes from <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1680628986.git.thomas.lendacky@amd.com/">a
separate patch set</a> from Tom Lendacky.
<p>
It turns out that SEV-SNP support has to handle a problem that TDX does
not: existing users.  The kernel has been able to work with SEV-SNP since
the 5.19 release, so there are already systems using SEV-SNP in the wild.
But current kernels, while they understand SEV-SNP, do not have support for
memory acceptance, or even the concept that memory must be explicitly
accepted.  If such a kernel is booted on a system where some of the memory
has not been accepted, it will be unable to use that memory and may fail
badly trying.
<p>
That is not the security experience that SEV-SNP was created to provide.
To avoid such an outcome, Lendacky's series includes <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1d38d28c2731075d66ac65b56b813a138900f638.1680628986.git.thomas.lendacky@amd.com/">a
patch</a> from Dionna Glaze adding a special UEFI protocol to provide
compatibility for older systems.  Specifically, when running on AMD
hardware, a booting system must invoke the new UEFI protocol prior to the
call to <a
href="https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/edk-ii-uefi-driver-writer-s-guide/5_uefi_services/readme.3/5312_exitbootservices"><tt>ExitBootServices()</tt></a>
that transfers full control away from the firmware.  If the call to the new
protocol is <i>not</i> made, the firmware will pre-accept all of the memory
provided to the system before handing control to the operating system.
<p>
This mechanism lets kernels that are capable of handling unaccepted memory
inform the firmware of that fact while avoiding problems for kernels that
lack that ability.  The plan is that this will be a temporary measure, only
needed until users can be expected to have newer kernels:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This protocol will be removed after the end of life of the first
	LTS that includes it, in order to give firmware implementations an
	expiration date for it. When the protocol is removed, firmware will
	strictly infer that a SEV-SNP VM is running an OS that supports the
	unaccepted memory type.
</blockquote>
<p>
When <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230113212926.2904735-1-dionnaglaze@google.com/">an
earlier version</a> of this patch was posted in January, Shutemov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230113222024.rp2erl54vx3grdbd@box.shutemov.name/">objected</a>,
calling the feature "<q>a bad idea</q>".  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230116134246.soworigs56bz5v7o@box.shutemov.name/">added</a>:
"<q>This patch adds complexity, breaks what works and the only upside will
turn into a dead weight soon</q>".  X86 maintainer Dave Hansen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/def9b0b5-b880-be99-fa95-b05d76a91824@intel.com/">agreed</a>,
worrying that it would never be possible to remove support for this
interface once it had been added.
<p>
Shutemov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230404174506.pjdikxvk2fsyy4au@box.shutemov.name/">reiterated</a>
his opposition in response to the most recent patch set, but this time
Hansen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/bc9e6d82-c7c1-47dc-e91f-57d9b4e2bb0a@intel.com/">indicated</a>
that he had changed his mind:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The fact is that we have upstream kernels out there with SEV-SNP
	support that don't know anything about unaccepted memory.  They're
	either relegated to using the pre-accepted memory (4GB??) or _some_
	entity needs to accept the memory.  That entity obviously can't be
	the kernel unless we backport unaccepted memory support.
</blockquote>
<p>
He would like to pretend that the problem doesn't exist, he continued, but
"<q>my powers of self-delusion do have their limits</q>".
<p>
Shutemov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230404180917.4fsgkzcdhqvph6io@box.shutemov.name/">was
unswayed</a>, though, suggesting that the hypervisor could load a special
firmware that pre-accepts all of the memory when launching a system that
lacks that support; how the hypervisor would know that about any specific
guest is not entirely clear.  Ard Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAMj1kXF0XyEOuSUDqgsLSYK8GSkGN1xK3RQ525+BxhG+7+vnCA@mail.gmail.com/">disagreed</a>,
arguing that letting the kernel make its own capabilities known to the
firmware is the most straightforward solution to a problem that cannot be
ignored.  When Shutemov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230405134226.2ptk3rd7mfin3wlm@box.shutemov.name/">said</a>
that this protocol would fail in cases where the bootloader calls
<tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> prior to starting the kernel, Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAMj1kXGgvk1=QQOJ_u-VqTyoOe68zv2cJYxuJfsvJR4-r5QshA@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>
that it was "<q>a theoretical concern</q>" that will not show up in
real-world use.
<p>
After holding a finger up to the wind, your editor's guess is that this
feature will eventually be accepted into the mainline.  A more interesting
question, perhaps, is when it will be removed.  Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAMj1kXEDYa5YcRj7t9JJmQ21+ierue2q6ADOXUOMjoOGndGRug@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that, over time, firmware will stop supporting this protocol, and it will
be possible to remove that support from the kernel as well.  Hansen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/e46777d3-adea-90a2-afc4-35f9d7cef50c@intel.com/">is
unconvinced</a>, though; he notes that users run old kernels for a long
time, so the support for them will also need to stay for a long time.  Or,
as he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/d3d95889-67ec-576e-ec9c-b9bd462e1c0e@intel.com/">said</a>
earlier in the discussion: "<q>Yeah, the only real expiration date for an
ABI is "never".  I don't believe for a second that we'll ever be able to
remove the interface.</q>"
<p>
There is nothing unusual about this situation; whenever maintaining
compatibility is a concern, software will fill up with little hacks like
this.  That is part of the cost of keeping things working.  In this case,
the cost appears small enough to be acceptable.  Existing SEV-SNP users
will, once this work is merged, be able to run their virtual machines on
systems where memory must be explicitly accepted prior to use.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

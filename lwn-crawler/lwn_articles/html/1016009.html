The CPU's translation lookaside buffer (TLB) caches the results of
virtual-address translations, significantly speeding memory accesses.  TLB
misses are expensive, so a lot of thought goes into using the TLB as
efficiently as possible.  Reducing pressure on the TLB was the topic of Rik
van Riel's memory-management-track session at the 2025 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit.  Some approaches were
considered, but the session was short on firm conclusions.
<p>
Whenever the kernel changes a virtual-address mapping, it must take care to
remove any TLB entries referring to the old mapping, or memory accesses
could end up going to the wrong place.  This TLB invalidation can be an
expensive operation, since it can require sending inter-processor
interrupts (IPIs) to every CPU on the system.  Van Riel started his session
by saying that he has been working on optimizing TLB invalidation on AMD
CPUs by using a special-purpose instruction that eliminates the need for
IPIs; <a href="/ml/all/20250226030129.530345-1-riel@surriel.com/">that
work</a> has since been merged for the 6.15 release.
<p>

He also has been <a
href="/ml/all/20250319132818.1003878b@fangorn/">working</a> to reduce the
number of TLB flushes required when pages are reclaimed.  He expected to
see a nice performance improvement, but this optimization turned out to
have almost no impact at all.  Looking more closely at the workload in
question, he found that it was experiencing about two-million TLB misses
per second — on each CPU.  This was a system with 200 CPUs.  So reducing
the number of TLB invalidations by a few thousand just did not help much.
<p>
So he started looking at ways to increase the use of transparent huge
pages.  One of the advantages of huge pages is that an entire huge page can be
referenced by a single TLB entry, greatly increasing the amount of address
space that can be covered by the TLB.  But the memory-management subsystem
is oriented toward PMD-level huge pages, which are 2MB in size on many
systems; they create more memory pressure as the result of internal
fragmentation, outweighing the savings that they provide.  More recent AMD
and Arm CPUs, though, can coalesce TLB entries for smaller groups of
physically contiguous pages.  If the kernel could use more multi-size
transparent huge pages (mTHPs), it could take better advantage of this
feature and get better TLB utilization while reducing internal
fragmentation.
<p>
Unfortunately, he said, the kernel's existing mechanisms for managing
transparent huge pages — the <tt>khugepaged</tt> thread and the huge-page
shrinker — cannot currently do much with mTHPs.  Relying on luck to create
mTHPs will not work, especially on Arm CPUs, where explicit
page-table-entry bits must be set to enable coalescing.  So the kernel
needs to learn to create mTHPs and, when necessary, split larger huge pages
into mTHPs.
<p>
There is <a href="/Articles/1009039/">ongoing work</a> to address these
concerns; it was raised during the session but not discussed at length.
Some time was spent on the "<tt>max_pte_none</tt>" problem (described at
length in the linked article) that determines how many contiguous pages
must be used before they can be coalesced into a huge page.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
Shakeel Butt asked if there is a way for user space to help with this
problem.  Van Riel answered that developers could look at switching to
different allocation sizes; putting allocations closer together would also
help to reduce TLB misses.  But this is a hard problem, since functions
like <tt>malloc()</tt> do not know how higher-level code will be using the
allocated memory.
<p>
A member of the audience pointed out that AMD's ability to perform TLB
coalescing without explicit page-table-entry bits is nice, but it only
works if the application has accessed at least half of the pages within the
mTHP.  The wider conclusion to draw from this detail is that techniques
for mTHP management that work on one architecture, or even one CPU
generation, may not work on others.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox said that the biggest benefit from mTHP use is reducing the
size of the kernel's least-recently-used (LRU) lists.  That leads to lower
lock-hold times when performing reclaim, and much less contention overall.
So, even in the absence of TLB-utilization improvements, using larger pages
is worth the trouble.
<p>
The final part of the discussion touched on a number of details related to
the management of mTHPs.  Ryan Roberts pointed out that if an application
calls <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
on a portion of an mTHP, the entire mTHP must be flushed from the TLB,
which is costly.  In such cases, it may have been better to not create the
mTHP in the first place.  Van Riel suggested that the kernel could watch
what user space is doing and react accordingly if it sees a lot of
<tt>madvise()</tt> calls or unused pages within mTHPs.  Roberts added that
the kernel's copy-on-write (COW) mechanism works on individual pages,
causing mTHPs to be split; it would be good to investigate performing COW
on larger folios.  Similarly, swapping can split folios which, as van Riel
added, is not optimal.  Compressed swapping mechanisms like zswap are more
effective when applied to larger chunks of memory.
<p>
As time ran out, David Hildenbrand pointed out that, for AMD CPUs, the
page-table-entries of a range of pages must match for TLB coalescing to
happen.  Perhaps, he suggested, more thought needs to be put into how those
bits are set to avoid blocking coalescing inadvertently.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <em>A member of the audience pointed out that AMD's ability to perform TLB coalescing without explicit page-table-entry bits is nice, but it only works if the application has accessed at least half of the pages within the mTHP.</em>

<p>I wonder what is the basis for this claim. I was under the impression that the page walker loads an entire cache line which contains 8 entries - hence the 32kB granularity of coalescing - and if the conditions are satisfied, e.g. the 8 entries point to 8 consecutive physical pages starting on 32kB boundary and share the same attributes, it sets up the TLB entry to cover the 8 pages. Why would it need the pages to be touched?</p>

<p>But even if it does, it is transparent. So it's always worth to make sure the conditions are satisfied.</p>

Many types of kernel changes can be hammered into shape on the mailing
lists.  There are certain types of patches, however, that have a hard time getting to
the finish line that way; they are sufficiently large and invasive that
they need an actual gathering of the developers involved.  The <a
href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational LRU work</a> (MGLRU) falls into this
category, which is why it was the subject of a full-hour session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM).  The discussion
held there may well have opened the doors for this code to be merged in the
near future.
<p>
<h4>MGLRU introduction</h4>
<p>
The session was led by Yu Zhao, the developer of the MGLRU work.  He
started by saying that RAM performance will continue to play a major role
in the performance of our systems as a whole.  Getting the best
performance, he said, requires overcommitting memory, leading to a couple
of problems.  One of those is deciding which objects should be present in
memory at any given time; that is what MGLRU is for.  Increasing the number
of pages that can be kept in memory is also an active area of work 
— defragmentation and zram, for example — but he wasn't there to talk about those.

<a href="/Articles/894872/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/YuZhao-sm.png" alt="[Yu Zhao]"
title="Yu Zhao" class="rthumb"></a>

<p>
He provided an introduction to MGLRU, which is also described in the
above-linked article.  At its core, it divides memory into a number of
buckets called "generations".  A page's generation reflects its "age" — how
long it has been since the page was last accessed.  The management of these
pages is done by a mechanism Zhao described as a "clock with two hands".
The aging hand scans the accessed bit of pages to see if they have been
used since the last scan; pages that have been used are marked to be moved
to the youngest generation.  The eviction hand will actually move pages to
the correct generation; those that end up in the oldest generation are the
coldest and can be considered for reclaim.
<p>
One of the interesting design decisions behind MGLRU is that its scanning walks
through process page tables rather than scanning physical memory.  This is
partly for efficiency, Zhao said; the LRU walk in current kernels is
constantly having to switch between different process's page tables, which
creates cache misses and 
slows things down.  The problem with walking page tables, though, is that
they can be sparse, with a lot of empty entries; scanning those brings no
benefit.  So the MGLRU code includes a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> that
helps it to avoid 
walking page-table pages that contain few active entries.
The MGLRU code also tries to learn from its mistakes by noticing when pages
it reclaims are quickly brought back into memory.  To that end, it
incorporates a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">proportional-integral-derivative
(PID)
controller</a> to redirect its attention when it seems to be making the
wrong decisions.
<p>
Johannes Weiner started the discussion by asking about how the aging works.
If a page in the oldest generation is seen to be accessed, is it moved to
the youngest generation, or just to the next-younger generation?  Zhao
answered that it actually depends on the type of access.  If the page was
accessed via a page table, then it goes to the youngest generation; if,
instead, it was accessed via a file descriptor, it only goes up one
generation.  There are two reasons for that: the cost of evicting
file-backed pages is lower, and the system can see every access (since they
are done through the kernel),
while accesses via page tables can only be observed once on every scan.
Andrew Morton asked whether the dirtyness of a page is factored in; the
answer was that dirty pages are moved up one generation.
<p>
<h4>Extensions</h4>
<p>
Weiner continued by noting that, in general, generational
garbage-collection algorithms try to look at how long objects have been in
use.  Everything starts in the oldest generation, and becomes less likely
to be reclaimed over time if it is used.  The MGLRU, though, starts
everything in the youngest generation, and will also promote pages directly
there.  What, he asked, do generations buy when they are managed this way?
<p>
The answer was a bit surprising: it seems that the full mechanism for
moving pages between generations is not yet in place.  When MGLRU was first
posted, Zhao said, it was called a "framework".  There are a lot of
different use cases out there, from servers to phones and more, and there
is a lot of variety even within a single category like phones.  Coming up
with a generation-assignment algorithm that works everywhere would be a
challenge, so MGLRU will allow it to be customized.  There will BPF hooks
that will be called on each page needing generation assignment; they will be provided with
the associated process ID, the page address, its type (anonymous or
file-backed), and, for page faults, the type of the fault.  The called
program can then tell the memory-management subsystem which generation the
page should be placed in.
The networking subsystem, Zhao continued, started with a single
congestion-control algorithm.  The number of those algorithms has grown
over time, and now their implementation is moving to BPF.  The MGLRU, he
said, is heading down the same path.
<p>
Weiner admitted that he hadn't known about this aspect of the MGLRU.
Zhao said that this machinery is not in the current patch posting, but
should probably be added.
<p>
A future MGLRU feature, Zhao continued, could be detection of internal
fragmentation with transparent huge pages.  There are a lot of applications
that suggest turning off this feature now; if their memory is sparsely
accessed, using huge pages can end up wasting a lot of memory.  He said
that Redis and memcached are among the applications that are affected by
this.  The problem is that access to a single base page can make an entire
huge page appear to be hot, potentially wasting up to 511 base pages in
each huge page.
<p>
Internal fragmentation of huge pages can be detected by initially mapping them
using base-page entries, then watching the access pattern with MGLRU.  If
most of the base pages end up in the younger generations (and are thus
being used), the mapping can be turned into a 
huge-page mapping; otherwise, the unused pages can simply be reclaimed.
Michal Hocko asked whether this code exists now; the answer was "no, but it
is likely to happen within the next four years".  Hocko then suggested
focusing on the code that is being considered now.  Before allowing that to
happen, Zhao suggested that ballooning for virtual machines is another
potential extension, allowing unused pages to be taken away.
<p>
<h4>Enabled by default?</h4>
<p>
Hocko said that there have been concerns about MGLRU expressed on the
mailing lists.  He asked where things should go from here.  MGLRU has some
nice potential for extension, he said, but the current LRU implementation
has been improved over many years and benefits from a lot of accumulated
experience.  He suggested that MGLRU could be merged alongside the existing
LRU with an opt-in approach.  Merging is the only way to find out how well
MGLRU really works across workloads, he said, but he was nervous about
switching over to it by default.
<p>
That said, he continued, perhaps enabling by default could be considered;
that would be a "trial by fire" for both the code and its developer.  It
would obviously be necessary to tell users clearly how to turn it off.
There are advantages to both approaches, he said, and maintaining two LRUs
will have a huge cost for as long as it lasts.  What, he asked, can the
group agree on?
<p>
Mel Gorman said that, if this code is merged, it should be enabled by
default.  That said, he worried that most distributions would <i>not</i> be
able to enable it because the MGLRU currently places a relatively low limit
on the maximum number of CPUs that the kernel can support.  Zhao said that
this limitation would be removed in the next version of the patch set.
Part of the problem with CPU counts is evidently the number of page flags
that MGLRU needs; Zhao suggested that he had a way to free up some page
flags, provoking curiosity and raised eyebrows in the group.  There
followed a digression on how this might be done that didn't reach any firm
conclusions.
<p>
Bringing the discussion back into focus, Gorman said that his 
testing shows that MGLRU performs reasonably well; it is better on
single-node machines than on NUMA systems, though.
<p>
Morton said that, if this code is going to succeed, it will start with a
relatively small number of users.  It will get better over time as the
problems are addressed, and people will start switching over to it.  He
worried, though, that the development history of the MGLRU code is hidden,
and that the code itself is "inscrutable"; he suggested putting a lot of
time into internal documentation.  Zhao, Morton said, needs to "tell a
story" to bring developers up to speed.
<p>
Continuing, Morton said that the current LRU still appears to perform
better for some workloads.  The kernel still has multiple slab allocators,
but he would rather not do that again; MGLRU should be made better for all
workloads.  On the other hand, we don't have that concern for filesystems;
we encourage users to choose between them.  Perhaps the same could be done
for the LRU.
<p>
He concluded that he could envision merging this code "in the next cycle",
but it is going to be a challenge.  Adding MGLRU takes developers who have
worked on memory management for decades and "turns them into new hires" who
will have to face a complex code base with no comments, and with nobody in
the next cubicle to ask about something they don't understand.
<p>
Zhao said that he has been having a hard time getting users to try MGLRU
without it being upstream.  This has evidently been a problem even within
Google.  His group ended up hiring an outside firm to do the benchmarking
on this code.
<p>
<h4>"Expect a few bug reports"</h4>
<p>
Hocko said that, if this code is merged, nobody seems to object to enabling
it by default.  He told Zhao to "expect a few bug reports" when that
happens, and asked whether Zhao was prepared for a massive amount of work.
Is he prepared to see the whole thing reverted if he can't keep up with
that work?  Morton suggested enabling MGLRU in linux-next for a single day
to see what happens, but Gorman said that it wouldn't be possible to get
useful information in that little time "unless it's an outright failure".
Real memory-management issues tend to be more subtle and take more time to
come out, he said; the only way to find them will be for major
distributors to enable MGLRU by default.
<p>
Zhao sought to reassure the group that Google would continue to support
this work; he said that both Android and the data center would start to use
it once it's merged.  The budget for this work has been planned for years
ahead, he said.  He has also been working with other companies, in private,
to get them to use it, and will continue to do so.  Hopefully he will
eventually be able to take a break, someday, but not soon.
<p>
Morton said that merging it disabled by default can still have a lot of
value, especially if Google can put resources behind testing and improving
it.  Gorman said that there are no good choices; if it is not enabled by
default, most people won't use it.  He is not opposed to merging this code,
but would like to see it enabled.  When transparent huge pages were merged,
he said, the feature was enabled by default and "set everything on fire".
It took three years to sort it all out, but without having been enabled for
all users, it would never have been fixed.
<p>
Zhao said he would prefer to follow the process used at Google, which
involves starting with a small group of users and slowly ramping up.
Gorman answered that an approach like that is good for a fleet, but it
doesn't help major distributors decide when to make a switch.  Even when
something works in the whole fleet, it doesn't mean that it will work in
the general case.  Weiner said that some distributors would turn MGLRU on
even if it were disabled by default; he mentioned Arch in particular.  That
might be a good way to avoid a "total flag day".  Matthew Wilcox agreed,
saying that enabling transparent huge pages by default was actually the
wrong thing to do.  Documentation lives forever, he said, and vendors are
still telling users to disable transparent huge pages even though the
problems have long since been fixed.
<p>
Zhao said that he could live with MGLRU by default, but then it
could become a problem for others; if he breaks things, users will suffer.
So he thinks that is a risky approach; switching to MGLRU by default after
a year might be better.  Weiner said that, if MGLRU is off by
default, there should be a set time frame to enable it — a maximum of a
couple of development cycles.
<p>
At that point, a rather tired set of memory-management developers called an
end to the session, and to the day.  It seems highly likely that this work
will be merged in the near future, though Morton's suggestion of doing it
for 5.19 might strike others as a bit hasty.  Whether it will be enabled
for all users, though, is far from clear.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Making something that works best for everyone is a never ending struggle. If this truly was possible, then the kernel would not have any configuration options at all.<br>
<p>
And the problem is even deeper with something like LRU where any change could cause a regression somewhere that you can not test. I do not see BPF being an escape hatch, but a very reasonable way to handle corner cases without worrying about unexpected regressions that help all but another corner case you are unaware of.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 2, 2008</br>

Linux provides a number of system calls that allow an application to wait
for file descriptors to become ready for I/O; they include
<tt>select()</tt>, <tt>pselect()</tt>, <tt>poll()</tt>, <tt>ppoll()</tt>,
and <tt>epoll_wait()</tt>.  Each of these interfaces allows the
specification of a timeout putting an upper bound on how long the
application will be blocked.  In typical fashion, the form of that timeout
varies greatly.  <tt>poll()</tt> and <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> take an integer
number of milliseconds; <tt>select()</tt> takes a <tt>struct timeval</tt>
with microsecond resolution, and <tt>ppoll()</tt> and <tt>pselect()</tt>
take a <tt>struct timespec</tt> with nanosecond resolution.
<p>
They are all the same, though, in that they convert this timeout value to
jiffies, with a maximum resolution between one and ten milliseconds.  A
programmer might program a <tt>pselect()</tt> call with a
10&nbsp;nanosecond timeout, but the call may not return until
10&nbsp;milliseconds later, even in the absence of contention for the CPU.
An error of six orders of magnitude seems like a bit much, especially given
that contemporary hardware can easily support much more accurate timing.
<p>
Arjan van de Ven recently surfaced with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296398/">a patch set</a> aimed at addressing
this problem.  The core idea is simple: have the code implementing
<tt>poll()</tt> and <tt>select()</tt> use high-resolution timers instead of
converting the timeout period to low-resolution jiffies.  The
implementation relied on a new function to provide the timeouts:
<p>
<pre>
    long schedule_hrtimeout(struct timespec *time, int mode);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>time</tt> is the timeout period, as interpreted by <tt>mode</tt>
(which is either <tt>HRTIMER_MODE_ABS</tt> or <tt>HRTIMER_MODE_REL</tt>).
<p>
High-resolution timeouts are a nice feature, but one can immediately
imagine a problem: higher-resolution timeouts are less likely to coincide
with other events which wake up the processor.  The result will be more
wakeups and greater power consumption.  As it happens, there are few
developers who are more aware of this fact than Arjan, who has done quite a
bit of work aimed at keeping processors asleep as much as possible.  His
solution to this problem was to only use high-resolution timeouts if the
timeout period is less than one second.  For longer timeout periods, the
old, jiffie-based mechanism was used as before.
<p>
Linus <a href="/Articles/296581/">didn't like that solution</a>, calling it
"ugly."  His preference, instead, was to have <tt>schedule_hrtimeout()</tt>
apply an appropriate amount of fuzz to all timeout values; the longer the
timeout, the less resolution would be supplied.  Alan Cox <a
href="/Articles/296585/">suggested</a> that a better mechanism would be
for the caller to supply the required accuracy with the timeout value.  The
problem with that idea, as Linus pointed out, is that the current system
call interfaces provide no way for an application to supply the accuracy
value.  One could create more <tt>poll()</tt>-like system calls - as if
there weren't enough of them already - with an accuracy parameter, but that
looks like a lot of trouble to create a non-standard interface which few
programmers would bother to use.
<p>
A different solution came in the form of Arjan's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296548/">range-capable timer patch set</a>.
This patch extends hrtimers to accept two timeout values, called the "soft"
and "hard" timeouts.  The soft value - the shorter of the two - is the
first time at which the timeout can expire; the kernel will make its best
effort to ensure that it does not expire after the hard period has
elapsed.  In between the two, the kernel is free to expire the timer at any
convenient time.
<p>
It's a useful feature, but it comes at the cost of some significant API
changes.  To begin with, the <tt>expires</tt> field of <tt>struct
hrtimer</tt> goes away.  Rather than manipulate <tt>expires</tt> directly,
kernel code must now use one of the new accessor functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void hrtimer_set_expires(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time);
    void hrtimer_set_expires_tv64(struct hrtimer *timer, s64 tv64);
    void hrtimer_add_expires(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time);
    void hrtimer_add_expires_ns(struct hrtimer *timer, unsigned long ns);
    ktime_t hrtimer_get_expires(const struct hrtimer *timer);
    s64 hrtimer_get_expires_tv64(const struct hrtimer *timer);
    s64 hrtimer_get_expires_ns(const struct hrtimer *timer);
    ktime_t hrtimer_expires_remaining(const struct hrtimer *timer);
</pre>
<p>
Once that's done, the range capability is added to hrtimers.  By default,
the soft and hard expiration times are the same; code which wishes to set
them independently can use the new functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void hrtimer_set_expires_range(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time, 
                                   ktime_t delta);
    void hrtimer_set_expires_range_ns(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time,
                                      unsigned long delta);
    ktime_t hrtimer_get_softexpires(const struct hrtimer *timer);
    s64 hrtimer_get_softexpires_tv64(const struct hrtimer *timer)
</pre>
<p>
In the new "set" functions, the specified <tt>time</tt> is the soft
timeout, while <tt>time+delta</tt> provides the hard timeout value.  There
is also another form of <tt>schedule_timeout()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int schedule_hrtimeout_range(ktime_t *expires, unsigned long delta,
				 const enum hrtimer_mode mode);
</pre>
<p>
With this infrastructure in place, <tt>poll()</tt> and friends can be given
approximate timeouts; the only remaining question is just how wide the
range of times should be.  In Arjan's patch, that range comes from two
different sources.  The first is a new field in the task structure called
<tt>timer_slack_ns</tt>; as one might expect, it specifies the maximum
expected timer accuracy in nanoseconds.  This value can be adjusted via the
<tt>prctl()</tt> system call.  The default value is set to
50&nbsp;microseconds - approximate to a certain degree, but still far more
accurate than the timeouts in current kernels.
<p>
Beyond that, though, there is a heuristic function which provides an
accuracy value depending on the requested timeout period.  In the case of
especially long timeouts - more than ten seconds - the accuracy is set to
100ms; as the timeouts get shorter, the amount of acceptable error drops,
down to a minimum of 10ns for very brief timeouts.  Normally,
<tt>poll()</tt> and company will use the value returned by the heuristic,
but with the exception that the accuracy will never exceed the value found
in <tt>timer_slack_ns</tt>.
<p>
The end result is the provision of more accurate timeouts on the polling
functions while, simultaneously, preserving the ability to combine timeouts
with other system events.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

AFAICT there is no way to set a lower bound on accuracy (i.e., "no really, I *meant* that timespec"), which might be useful for realtime work.<br>
<p>
Squinting at the code, I think the constants in the accuracy heuristic are actually ok for the soft-realtime case that I happen to care about.  It seems safer to use timerfd for RT poll timeouts, though -- it seems to keep full accuracy (though perhaps that's a bug!).<br>

it's a hard complex problem; the only real solution is to have a pppoll syscall that takes explicit slack as argument, for those people who really need that 10 second sleep with 1 nanosecond accuracy.<br>
<p>
I can't say that I'm happy about the "estimate how big the slack is" function, but I've not been able to come up with something significantly nicer that still works well (where "works well" includes just doing the right thing for power saving). I was hoping others on lkml would have better ideas but so far it seems it's a hard problem, where the best I've seen so far is "just use 0.1% of the total delay".<br>

How about people who need the really high accuracy use the timerfd() and insert that timer into their poll/epoll/select set and then give no timeout when they wait on that event set. That way, the highly accurate timers can be used while letting all the ordinary stuff use the existing mechanism that saves power by waking everyone up at the same time etc.<br>

It might be sufficient to just disable the heuristic when the thread making the syscall has real-time priority.  Don't know if that's the Perfect Answer, but I think it would be an incremental improvement at least.<br>
<p>
I don't much like the idea of making this an undocumented difference between different timing syscalls (like someone else suggested), so that if you use ppoll you get one thing and timerfd another etc. -- I don't see why timerfd should be useful only to apps who need precision and don't care about power!  Really the behavior should be uniform across ppoll/poll/pselect/select, epoll, timerfd, nanosleep, posix timers, interval timers.  (Not sure if all of those use hrtimers yet; I know nanosleep and posix timers do in -rt.)<br>
<p>
For timerfd in particular, one could add a timerfd_setslack call without breaking compatibility.  It might be possible for some of those other APIs as well.<br>

the realtime thing is there already in my current codebase<br>
<p>
right now what I do is (in summary)<br>
<p>
if realtime =&gt; slack is 0<br>
<p>
if nice, slack is 0.5% with a max of 100 msec<br>
if not nice, slack is 0.1% with a max of 100 msec<br>

Using prctl() for a process-wide timer accuracy doesn't appear to be a good idea to me. In many RT apps you have both RT and non-RT threads. Usually only for the RT threads timer accuracy matters while the non-RT threads only do non-critical housekeeping work where accuracy really doesn't matter. Having a per-thread way to adjust timer accuracy seems more appropriate to me.<br>

Why do we use prctl at all anyway? Isn't adding a new prctl just a backdoor way of adding another system call? Doesn't the same argument against using ioctl for arbitrary functionality apply also to prctl?<br>
<p>
Why not just add new system calls for new functionality?<br>

prctl()'s purpose is to get and set values/properties on a per thread basis.....<br>
<p>
it's not nearly as much a blanket thing as ioctl() is.<br>

One nice thing about such interfaces is that you can usually check for the interface using the C preprocessor (i.e. "#if defined FD_CLOEXEC ... #elif defined HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT ..."). For totally obscure non-portable interfaces, that's definitely a win, especially for those of us not willing to use autoconf (or unable, such as when porting to Visual Studio).<br>

"This value can be adjusted via the prctl() system call. The default value is set to 50 microseconds - approximate to a certain degree, but still far more accurate than the timeouts in current kernels"<br>
<p>
Why not set the default value to one jiffy?  That would maintain compatibility with older kernels, and the longer default value would result in fewer wakeups for programs that haven't called prctl().<br>

one of the issues is that the old code had a *maximum* of a 1 millisecond, but the average was more like 500 usec.<br>
<p>
The other thing is... with the code in the patchkit, the behavior in terms of power isn't all that bad (after all, userland isn't poll()ing like crazy anymore; all that got fixed with powertop).<br>
And using 50 usec means that media apps and desktop apps actually get an improvement in behavior... I'd hate to give away that real value for something that doesn't really save more power.<br>

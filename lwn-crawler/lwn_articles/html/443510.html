           <p>May 18, 2011</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Paul McKenney</p>
           </div>
<p>Some of you might have heard about
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/439314/">some discomfort with the state of
the ARM architecture</a> in the kernel
recently.
Given that ARM Linux consolidation was one of the issues that
<a href="http://www.linaro.org/about-linaro/">Linaro</a>
was specifically set up to address, it is only fair to ask
&ldquo;What is Linaro doing about this?&rdquo;
So it should not come as a surprise that this topic featured
prominently at the recent
<a href="https://wiki.linaro.org/Events/2011-05-LDS">Linaro Developers Summit</a>
in Budapest, Hungary.
</p>

<p>Duplicate code and out-of-tree patches
make Linux on ARM more difficult to use and develop for.
Therefore, Linaro is working to consolidate code and to push code
upstream.
This should make the upstream Linux kernel
more capable of handling ARM boards and system-on-chips (SoCs).
However, ARM Linux kernel consolidation
is an issue not just for Linaro, but rather
across the entire ARM Linux kernel community, as well as
the ARM SoC, board, and system vendors.
Therefore, although I expect that Linaro will play a key role,
the ultimate solution spans the entire ARM
community.
It is also important to note that this effort is a proposal
for an experiment rather than a set of hard-and-fast marching orders.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Code organization</h4>

<p>If we are to make any progress at all, we must start
somewhere.
An excellent place to start is by organizing the ARM Linux kernel
code by function rather than by SoC/board implementation.
Grouping together code with similar purposes will make it easier
to notice common patterns and, indeed, common code.
For example, currently many ARM SoCs use similar &ldquo;IP blocks&rdquo;
(such as I2C controllers) but each SoC provides a completely different
I2C driver that lives in the corresponding <code>arch/arm/mach-</code>
directory.
We expect that drivers
for identical hardware &ldquo;IP blocks&rdquo;
across different ARM boards and SoCs
will be consolidated into a single driver that works with any system using
the corresponding IP block.
In some cases, differences in the way that a given IP block is connected
to the SoC or board in question may introduce complications, but such
complications can almost always be addressed.
</p>

<p>This raises the question of where similar code should be moved to.
The short answer that was agreed to by all involved is
&ldquo;Not in the <code>arch/arm</code> directory!&rdquo;
Drivers should of course move to the appropriate
subdirectory of the top-level <code>drivers</code> tree.
That said, ARM SoCs have a wide variety of devices ranging from touchscreens
to GPS receivers to accelerometers,
and new types of devices can be expected to appear.
So in some cases it might be necessary not merely to move the driver to
a new place, but also to create a new place in the <code>drivers</code>
tree.
</p>

<p>But what about non-driver code?
Where should it live?
It is helpful to look at several examples: (1) the <code>struct clk</code>
code that Jeremy Kerr, Russell King, Thomas Gleixner, and many others
have been working on,
(2) the device-tree code that Grant Likely has been leading up, and
(3) the generic interrupt chip implementation that Thomas Gleixner has
been working on.
</p>

<p>The <code>struct clk</code> code is motivated by the fact that many
SoCs and boards have elaborate clock trees.
These trees are needed, among other things, to allow the tradeoff between
performance and energy efficiency to be set as needed for individual
devices on that SoC or board.
The <code>struct clk</code> code allows these trees to be represented
with a common format while providing plugins to accommodate behavior
specific to a given SoC or board.
The
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/439176/">generic interrupt chip
implementation</a>
has a similar role, but with respect to
interrupt distribution rather than clock trees.
</p>

<p><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/414016/">Device trees</a> are intended
to allow the hardware configuration of a board to be represented
via data rather than code, which should ease the task of creating a
single Linux kernel binary that boots on a variety of ARM boards.
The device-tree infrastructure patches have recently been
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.linaro.devel/4170">accepted by Russell King</a>, which
should initiate the transition of specific board code to device tree
descriptions.
</p>

<p>The <code>struct clk</code> code is already used by
both the ARM and SH CPU architectures,
so it is not ARM-specific, but rather core Linux kernel code.
Similarly, the device-tree code is not ARM-specific; it
is also used by the PowerPC, Microblaze, and SPARC architectures, and even by
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/424401/">x86</a>.
Device tree therefore is also Linux core kernel code.
The virtual-interrupt code goes even further, being common across all
CPU architectures.
The lesson here is that ARM kernel code consolidation need not necessarily
be limited to ARM.
In fact, the more architectures that a given piece of code supports,
the more developers can be expected to contribute both code and testing
to it, and the more robust and maintainable that code will be.
</p>

<p>There will of course need to be at least some ARM-specific code,
but the end goal is for that code to be limited to ARM core architecture code
and ARM SoC core architecture code.
Furthermore, the ARM SoC core architecture code should consist primarily
of small plugins for core-Linux-kernel frameworks, which should in turn
greatly ease the development and maintenance of new ARM boards and SoCs.
</p>

<p>It is all very easy to write about doing this, but quite another to
actually accomplish it.
After all, although there are a good number of extremely talented and
energetic ARM developers and maintainers, many of the newer ARM developers
are also new to the Linux kernel, and cannot
be expected to to know where new code should be placed.
Such people might be tempted to continue placing most of their code in
their SoC and board subdirectories, which would just perpetuate the
current ARM Linux kernel difficulties.
</p>

<p>Part of the solution will be additional documentation, especially
on writing ARM drivers and board ports.
Deepak Saxena, the new Linaro Kernel Working Group lead, will be
making this happen.
Unfortunately, documentation is only useful to the extent that anyone
actually reads it.
Fortunately, just as every problem in computer science seems to be solvable
by adding an additional level of indirection, every maintainership
problem seems to be solvable by adding an additional git tree
and maintainers.
These maintainers would help generate common code and of course point
developers at documentation as it becomes available.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Git trees</h4>
<p>
<p>One approach would be to use Nicolas Pitre's existing Linaro kernel
git tree.
However, Nicolas's existing git tree is an
<a href="https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/Kernel/KernelTree">
integration tree</a>
that allows people
to easily pull the latest and greatest ARM code against the most
recent mainline kernel version.
In contrast, a maintainership tree contains patches that are to be
upstreamed, normally based on a more-recent mainline release candidate.
If we tried to use a single git tree for both integration and for
maintainership, we would either unnecessarily expose ARM users to
unrelated core-kernel bugs, or we would fail to track mainline
closely enough for maintainership, which would force a full rebase
and testing cycle to happen in a very short time at the beginning of
each merge window.

</p><p>Of course, in theory we could have both maintainership and
integration branches within the same git tree, but separating these
two very different functions into separate git trees is most likely
to work well, especially in the beginning.

<p>This new git tree (which was <a href="/Articles/443515/">announced</a>
on May&nbsp;18) will have at least one branch per participating ARM
subarchitecture, and these branches will not be normally subject to
rebasing, thus making it easy to develop against this new tree.
Following the usual practice, maintainers of participating ARM
sub-architectures will send pull requests to a group of maintainers
for this new tree.  Also following the usual practice, a merge of all
the branches will be sent to Stephen Rothwell's -next tree, but the
branches will be individually pushed to Linus Torvalds, perhaps via
Russell King's existing ARM tree.
</p>

<p>The pushing of individual branch to Linus might seem surprising,
but Linus really does want to see the conflicts that arise.
Such conflicts presumably help Linus identify areas in need of his
attention.
</p>

<p>Of course, this new git tree will not be limited to Linaro, but neither
is it mandatory outside of Linaro.
That said, I am very happy to say that some maintainers outside of Linaro
have expressed interest in participating in this effort.
</p>

<p>The Budapest meeting put forward a list of members of the
maintainership group for this new git
tree, namely Arnd Bergmann, Nicolas Pitre, and Marc Zyngier, with help
from Thomas Gleixner.
Russell King will of course also have write access to this tree.
The tree will be set up in time to handle the 2.6.41 merge window.
The plan is to start small and grow by evolution rather than by
any attempts at intelligent design.
</p>

<p>As noted at the beginning of this article, this effort is an
experiment rather than a set of hard-and-fast marching orders.
Although this proposed experiment cannot be expected to solve each
and every ARM Linux problem, they will hopefully provide a good start.
Every little bit helps, and every cleanup frees a little time to
start on the next cleanup.
There is reason to hope that this effort will help to reduce the
&ldquo;<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/439326/">endless amounts of new pointless platform code</a>&rdquo;
that irritated Linus Torvalds last month.

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 22, 2015</br>
           </div>
A great deal of work has gone into improving the Linux kernel's block layer
so that it can keep up with solid-state storage devices (SSDs).  Dealing
with SSDs has often been an exercise in frustration, though, for one simple
reason: the kernel is not able to manage the storage device directly, but,
instead, must talk to a computer embedded in the device that is running
some sort of flash 
translation layer (FTL) software.  Developers have often felt that a better
job could be done without the FTL getting in the way.  Now, it seems, the
hardware manufacturers are starting to make direct control easier; a patch
set has been posted that aims to enable the kernel to take advantage of
this opening.
<p>
The problems with flash translation layers are numerous and well known.
Often they are designed to optimize access for one specific filesystem
(FAT, for example), a feature that often makes performance worse for other
filesystems.  Attempts to allow
operating systems to communicate usage information to the drives (the
discard/TRIM 
command, which indicates a range of blocks that is not in use, is an
example) have led to performance problems and bugs of their own.  And an
FTL baked into a drive cannot normally be upgraded or fixed when bugs
appear.  All of these problems would go away if the kernel could just
access the low-level storage media directly.
<p>
There are a number of high-end nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices that
provide this access now, but 
there's one catch: each model has its own interface, and sometimes the nature
of those interfaces varies wildly.  The rest of the kernel, though, cares
little about those details; it needs to know a relatively small number of
parameters to be able to manage such a device.  The required information
includes the layout of blocks on the device, some timing details, and not a
whole lot more.  If there were an abstraction layer in the kernel that
provided just the required interface, the task of managing these devices
would get easier.
<p>
A candidate for this abstraction layer is <a
href="/Articles/641358/">LightNVM</a>, posted by Matias Bj√∏rling.  LightNVM
is, at its base, a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kedBY_1-hfkAlqT4EdwY6gz-6UOZbn7kIjWpmBLPNj0/edit">specification
of an interface</a> by which the kernel can access what Matias calls
"open-channel SSDs."  His implementation adapts the kernel's <a
href="http://www.nvmexpress.org/">NVM Express</a> driver to provide the
LightNVM interface; the generic block layer code is then adjusted to take
advantage of the new capabilities that are provided.
<p>
A LightNVM driver is, to begin with, an ordinary block driver.  To get the
full performance advantage, it should implement the <a
href="/Articles/552904/">multiqueue block interface</a>, though that does
not appear to be strictly necessary.  On top of the block interface,
though, the driver must implement a set of LightNVM-specific APIs, most of
which are defined by this structure of function pointers:
<p>
<pre>
    struct nvm_dev_ops {
	nvm_id_fn		*identify;
	nvm_get_features_fn	*get_features;
	nvm_set_rsp_fn		*set_responsibility;
	nvm_get_l2p_tbl_fn	*get_l2p_tbl;
	nvm_erase_blk_fn	*erase_block;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>identify()</tt> operation identifies the type of the device and,
importantly, the number of independent I/O channels it supports; that
number affects how many operations can execute in parallel.  A call to
<tt>get_features()</tt> obtains information about the capabilities of the
drive, including whether it can do its own logical-to-physical address
mapping, whether the drive performs garbage collection, whether it can
perform ECC error correction, and so on.  The
<tt>set_responsibility()</tt> function tells the drive which features
should actually be enabled.  The current mapping between logical and
physical blocks can be read from the device with <tt>get_l2p_tbl()</tt>.
Finally, a call to <tt>erase_block()</tt> will cause a specific erase block
to be wiped.
<p>
The code as posted appears to expect that on-drive logical-to-physical
mapping will be supported, but that no other features will be present.
Adding support for the other features should be an optimization opportunity
in the future, especially as drives supporting options like "block move"
(which relocates a block on the drive without requiring the host to read
and rewrite it) become available.
<p>
At the block-layer level, the patch set provides a mechanism by which the
LightNVM code can intercept I/O requests, remap them, and pass the modified
request directly to the hardware.  For a read request, this task is
relatively simple: the logical-to-physical table is consulted to locate the
block's address on the drive, then a read is performed from that address.
Writes are more complicated, since data in flash cannot be rewritten in
place.  Instead, the code must find a new location for the block, cause it
to be written there, invalidate the copy of the block at the old location,
and update the translation maps accordingly.
<p>
In the posted patch set, this work is done by the "RRPC target," a
round-robin FTL built into the kernel itself.  The wear-leveling algorithm
used is fairly simple; the code sequences through erase blocks one after
another, relocates any valid sectors found within each erase block, then
wipes the block for reuse.  It does not even support discard requests at
this point.  The point is clearly to demonstrate a functioning in-kernel
FTL while leaving the optimization opportunities for later.
<p>
There will be a number of such opportunities, but it could take a while to
realize many of them.  For example, getting the best performance out of
such a device requires spreading data across each of the available
channel controllers in such a way as to keep them all busy.  To an extent, that
could be done purely in the FTL, but chances are good that higher
performance will result if the filesystem is aware of the device's
geometry.  Currently there is no API to pass that information up, so,
needless to say, no filesystems have that support.
<p>
So LightNVM in its current form is just a start.  But it should be enough
to test the idea that kernel developers can, in the long run, do a better
job of managing flash arrays than the firmware developers who write FTLs
have traditionally been able to achieve.
<p>
There is one last question that has not really even been asked yet with
regard to this patch set, though.  LightNVM is intended to manage
nonvolatile memory as if it were a block storage device.  But there is
<a href="/Articles/640113/">a lot of work</a> going into the creation of
large, nonvolatile-memory devices that are 
mapped directly into the system's physical address space; from there, that
memory can be mapped into a process's virtual address space.  While it
would be possible to use a kernel layer like LightNVM to do the low-level
management for directly mapped devices, that does not appear to be the
approach that most manufacturers (and developers) have in mind.  So it
seems likely that the FTL will remain deeply buried within the hardware for
those devices.  That could, in the long term, restrict the applicability of
block-oriented subsystems like LightNVM.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

a0273324@ti.com, I had a similar reaction.    Why not use UBI as an LVM for NVM?   I'll have to compare LightNVM to see how it differs.  At least the news is welcome that bypassing the on-board management engine will soon be possible.   I wonder how many manufacturers will support the new interface if doing so undermines their claim of having a differentiated storage controller.<br>

MTD solves the problem of directly driving raw flash. Whereas Open-Channel SSDs have flash controllers embedded in hardware, that takes care of scheduling, driving hundred of flash chips, and provide power capacitors for durability. The host primarily handles data placement, I/O scheduling, and garbage collection and leaves everything else to the SSD controller. Making it more efficient for &gt;1M IOPS devices.<br>

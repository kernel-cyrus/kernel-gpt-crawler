<h1>Three talks on kernel development tools</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 22, 2014</br>

<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2014-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
By design, the Linux Plumbers Conference tries to emphasize discussions
over presentations.  The development tools microconference ran against that
stream, though, consisting mostly of a series of presentations on interesting
applications of tools to the kernel.  Some of the tools are more
immediately useful than others;  here we'll focus on a few of the tools
that can help developers now.

<p>
<h4>Using Coccinelle for backports</h4>
<p>
The <a href="https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">kernel
backports project</a> works to provide drivers from leading-edge kernels
backported to 
older stable kernel releases.  The idea is to provide the best hardware
support on a platform that, as a whole, is relatively stable and bug-free.
It is not surprising that enterprise Linux distributors are interested in
this work, but others are as well.
<p>
The project currently has three core developers working to backport about
800 drivers to older kernels.  Needless to say, that is quite a bit of
work; Luis Rodriguez talked about how the <a
href="http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/">Coccinelle</a> tool can be used to make
the problem tractable for a relatively small group of developers.  (See <a
href="/Articles/315686/">this article</a> for an introduction to Coccinelle
and its capabilities).

</blockquote>
<p>
Obviously, some amount of compromise is needed to scale up to 800
backported drivers.  Actually testing all of those drivers is one of the
first things to go; the developers lack both the time and the hardware to
do that testing.  So all they can do is promise that the backported drivers
will compile.  Drivers are backported as far as the 3.0 stable kernel; the

<a href="/Articles/617440/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2014/lce-lpc/LuisRodriguez-sm.jpg" width=250 height=270

align="right"></a> 

group used to offer backports into the 2.6 series, but interest in those
has waned.  Various types of drivers are not even considered for
backporting; the DRM subsystem, for example, is complex, and there is not
enough interest on the distributor side to justify the work.  So most of
the backported drivers are in subsystems like Ethernet, wireless,
Bluetooth, NFS, Video4Linux, and so on.
<p>
The backporting project, Luis said, serves as a motivation to developers to
get their code upstream.  Once a driver is in the mainline kernel, the
backporting effort is available for free.
<p>
Backporting is a bit of an unusual use case for Coccinelle, which is
normally used to evolve the kernel forward.  Most developers will
occasionally use it to make a forward change in specific parts of the
kernel.  The backporting project, instead, uses it every day against all of
the drivers on its list.
<p>
Backporting has traditionally been done, Luis said, by sprinkling
<tt>#ifdef</tt>s throughout the code.  That is "backporting on drugs"; it
leads to patches that are long and hard to review.  And the same tiresome
work has to be done for every driver on the list.  There must be a better
way.
<p>
The first step in that better way is to move as much backporting-related
code as possible into header files.  If, for example, a function prototype
has been changed, the relevant header will contain a new version of the
function (under a different name) that works with older code.  The various
call sites can then be fixed up to use the new function, with no
<tt>#ifdef</tt> lines in the code itself.  For the easier changes, Luis
said, Coccinelle can apply this kind of update with no trouble at all.
<p>
What about harder changes?  An example Luis raised was <a
href="/Articles/302043/">threaded interrupt handlers</a>; how does one port
code using threaded handlers back to kernels that do not provide that
capability?  The answer in this case was to backport threaded handlers in a
separate module and add a <tt>compat_request_threaded_irq()</tt> function
for backported drivers.  The hard part, though, was figuring out where to
put the needed private data pointer.  A tricky Coccinelle semantic patch
was written to figure out which data structure each driver was using to
represent its device, then add the new pointer to that structure.  With
that in place, the backport can be done in an automated mode for all drivers.
<p>
In summary, Luis said, using Coccinelle for backporting makes the effort
easier and more consistent; with Coccinelle, the team is able to backport
far more drivers.  By making one Coccinelle rule for each relevant
evolution of the kernel, the team can keep up with the kernel's changes and
get, for all practical purposes, automatic backports of a wide range of
drivers.  According to Luis, the effort is sufficiently worthwhile that,
arguably, the semantic patches used for backporting should be kept in the
upstream kernel — though nobody has proposed a patch to make that happen
yet.
<p>
<h4>Watch out for the undertaker</h4>
<p>
Kernel developers try to minimize the use of <tt>#ifdef</tt> constructs,
but there are still massive numbers of them in the kernel source tree.  The
interesting thing, according to Valentin Rothberg, is that a lot of these
blocks do not actually make sense.  In many cases, there is no possible
combination of kernel configuration choices that can cause a block of code
to be compiled; that block is thus dead code.  In others, code will be
compiled in all cases; Valentin called such code "undead."
<p>
Dead and undead code can come about for a variety of reasons.  Misspelled
<tt>CONFIG_</tt> symbol names are one obvious source; an unknown identifier
simply evaluates to false rather than raising an error.  Sometimes
configuration symbols are not truly independent; imagine a
<tt>CONFIG_BAR</tt> that can 
only be set if <tt>CONFIG_FOO</tt> is set first.  If you then see code
like:
<p>
<pre>
    #ifdef CONFIG_BAR
      /* ... */
    #ifndef CONFIG_FOO
      /* this code is dead */
    #endif
    #endif
</pre>
<p>
you know that the block of code in the middle will never be compiled.
About 25% of all dead/undead code blocks in the kernel are caused by this
kind of logic error.  All told,
Valentin found over 1000 dead or undead blocks in the 2.6.29 kernel; that
number has dropped to about 600 in 3.17 — an improvement, but still too
many.  These <tt>#ifdef</tt> blocks are intentionally conditional; dead or
undead blocks go against that intention.  Sometimes they hide bugs as well;
Valentin found a memory leak bug caused by a misspelling of
<tt>CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU</tt>.
<p>
The solution to this problem is to make use of Valetin's
<tt>undertaker-checkpatch</tt> tool.  It will examine a patch, note changes
to <tt>#ifdef</tt> blocks, and flag any dead or undead code that it finds.
Patches checked this way should not add more <tt>#ifdef</tt>-related
problems to the kernel.  Undertaker can be found at <a
href="https://vamos.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/trac/undertaker">this web
page</a>.
<p>
Your editor asked why this work, which seems valuable, wasn't simply
integrated into <tt>checkpatch.pl</tt> and merged upstream.  There are a
few problems with that idea, it seems, starting with the fact that
<tt>undertaker-checkpatch</tt> is written in C++.  It also takes a few
minutes to run, something that might not be welcome in a typical kernel
developer's workflow.  In the end, Valentin said, it is a research project;
the developers lack the time and motivation to turn it into production
code.
<p>
Thus it seems like <tt>undertaker-checkpatch</tt> might suffer the fate of
many academic projects.  But there is still one way that this tool could be
put to use in the kernel development community: integrate it into Fengguang
Wu's zero-day testing system.  Then developers would receive a polite email
when they add <tt>#ifdef</tt>-related problems to the kernel.  That,
Valentin said, is his preferred route toward making this tool more useful for
the kernel community.
<p>
<h4>Vampyr</h4>
<p>
A project closely related to Undertaker is Vampyr, which is being worked on
by the same group of developers.  Stefan Hengelein described the
fundamental problem that Vampyr seeks to address: the fact that most kernel
patches are only tested against one or two kernel configurations.  But the
actual configuration space for the kernel is huge, and it is often not hard
to find combinations of configuration parameters that do not work as
intended.  
<p>
So, Stefan said, patches need to be reviewed with all of the relevant
configuration options in mind.  That is hard to do, requiring a lot of
brainpower.  Current kernels have nearly 14,000 configuration options; it

<a href="/Articles/617442/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2014/lce-lpc/StefanHengelein-sm.jpg" width=250 height=252
alt="[Stefan Hengelein]" title="Stefan Hengelein" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

is questionable whether any amount of available brainpower is up to looking
at code with all of the possible combinations of that many options in
mind.  
<p>
The alternative is the Vampyr tool, which is designed to create a
"maximizing set" of kernel configurations for a given patch.  It searches
through the configuration space, finding combinations that result in
different code being compiled.  The result is typically a handful of
configurations, each of which can then be used for build tests.
<p>
Using Vampyr, the developers have manage to unearth a lot of warnings and
some outright errors.  The x86 code generates 15% more warnings when Vampyr
is used, while MIPS increases by 58%.  With the ARM architecture, use of
Vampyr nearly doubled the number of warnings, and resulted in the
identification of 91 confirmed bugs.  The situation has improved in later
kernels, Stefan said, especially in the x86 code — other architectures have
not improved that much.
<p>
The code is available under GPLv3, he said; it can be obtained from the
Undertaker web site.

The discussion about undertaker raises a small issue about the use of preprocessor directives--the use of #ifdef SYMBOL. If SYMBOL is misspelled, it is treated the same as if it was intentionally not defined. In many cases, though there are exceptions, it is better to use #if SYMBOL, definining SYMBOL to be 0 or 1 or, possibly, an expression using define(SOME_OTHER_SYMBOL). This way misspellings will be detected and an error generated.<br>
<p>
It's too late to do this with Kconfig, which is unfortunate. It would, however, probably have generated much longer .config files, which might have been a significant drawback. On the upside, symbols in .config are probably given more testing than derived symbols so misspellings are more likely to be caught.<br>

Well, now, don't I feel silly. This actually implies I've never made the error I was trying to catch, or at least never made it with a standards compliant version of C. I have used more than a few non-compliant versions of C, so perhaps that's where I came up with it. Live and learn. <br>

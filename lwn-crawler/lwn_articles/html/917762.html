           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>December 14, 2022</br>

<p>
A report from the <a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md">syzbot</a>
kernel fuzz-testing robot does not usually spawn a 
vitriolic mailing-list thread, but that is just what happened recently.
While the invective is regrettable, the underlying issue is important.  The
dispute revolves around how best to report bugs 
to affected subsystems and, ultimately, how not to waste maintainers' time.
</p>

<p>
Al Viro was <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5VGCefLZmrOyd0Z@ZenIV/">apparently fed
up</a> with syzbot reports that involved the ntfs3 
filesystem but that were not copied (CCed) to the maintainers of ntfs3.
The syzbot message was sent to the kernel mailing list, but Viro shouted
his reply that 
"<q>ANY BUG REPORTS INVOLVING NTFS3 IN 
REPRODUCER NEED TO BE CCED TO MAINTAINERS OF NTFS3</q>".  That complaint had
been relayed several times in the past, he indicated, without the problem
getting 
fixed, so he was planning to stop looking at the reports. In fact, they
will be "<q>getting triaged 
straight to /dev/null here</q>".
</p>

<p>
After an ... impenetrable <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221211075612.2486-1-hdanton@sina.com/">reply</a>
from Hillf Danton, Viro <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5WXNhO9UNogf8lq@ZenIV/">followed up</a>
with more details of the problems he sees.  He pointed to a <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/YzEJ2D8kga+ZRDZx@ZenIV/">post from
September</a> where he made a similar request and said that others had also
reported these kinds of problems to the maintainers of syzbot.  The issue
is that the mail sent by syzbot does not contain enough useful information
for someone to quickly determine if it pertains to their area of interest:
<blockquote class="bq">
It's really a matter of triage; as it is, syzkaller folks are
expecting that any mail from the bot will be looked into by everyone
on fsdevel, on the off-chance that it's relevant for them.  What's
more, it's not just "read the mail" - information in the mail body
is next to useless in such situations. [...]
<p>
What really pisses me off is that on the sending side the
required check is trivial - if you are going to fuzz a filesystem,
put a note into report, preferably in subject.  Sure, it's your
code, you get to decide what to spend your time upon (you == syzkaller
maintainers).  But please keep in mind that for [recipients] it's
a lot of recurring work, worthless for the majority of those who
end up bothering with it.  Every time they receive a mail from
that source.
<p>
Ignore polite suggestions enough times, earn a mix of
impolite ones and .procmailrc recipes, it's that simple...
</blockquote> 
</p>

<p>
Danton <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221211102208.2600-1-hdanton@sina.com/">misunderstood</a>
what Viro was complaining about, but Matthew Wilcox tried to <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5X7RBznTD6rPfro@casper.infradead.org/">explain</a>.
The complaint is not that the linux-fsdevel list is being
copied on the mail, but that the ntfs3 maintainers are not. Wilcox said:
"<q>So this is just noise. 
And enough noise means that signal is lost.</q>"  
</p>

<p>
Viro <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5ZDjuSNuSLJd8Mn@ZenIV/">agreed</a> and
painstakingly described exactly how he (and any other interested recipient
of a syzbot report) would triage it, which eventually ends up at the <a
href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=e8da337c58f1a620dce15898ae21af03e0a5ddb3">syzkaller
dashboard entry</a> for the bug and its <a
href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproSyz&x=10aaf2b7880000">syzkaller
reproducer</a>.  That file, which resembles "<q>line
noise</q>", as Viro noted, does contain enough information to see that it
was an ntfs3 filesystem that was being fuzzed.  But that information is not
in the email (or, better still, email subject), nor is it used to direct
the report to the right people to look at it.  The underlying problem is
that the syzkaller/syzbot maintainers are not providing the relevant data,
which should be easily obtained:
<blockquote class="bq">
From what I've seen in various discussions, the assumption of syzkaller
folks seems to be that most of the relevant information is in stack
trace and that's sufficient for practical purposes - anything beyond
that is seen as unwarranted special-casing.  [...]
<p>
Face it, the underlying assumption is broken - for a large class
of reports the stack trace does not contain the relevant information.
It needs to be augmented by the data that should be very easy to
get for the bot.  Sure, your code, your priorities, but reports
are only useful when they are not ignored and training people to
ignore those is a bad idea...
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5d565XVsinbNNL2@mit.edu/">agreed</a>,
noting that he has been asking for improvements of this sort for several
years.  Syzbot "<q>is not doing things that really could be
done automatically --- and cloud VM time is cheap, and upstream
maintainer time is expensive</q>".  In effect, the syzbot developers are
not being respectful of upstream maintainers' time, he said.  Things have
been improving, but not in this particular area:
<blockquote class="bq">
Now, to be fair to the Syzbot team, the Syzbot console has gotten much
better.  You can now download the syzbot trace, and download the
mounted file system, when before, you had to do a lot more work to
extract the file system (which is stored in separate constant C
array's as compressed data) from the C reproducer.  So have things
have gotten better.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Marco Elver <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CANpmjNNCQEXpJt1PQptyr8mrBbhWpToCRfvUT+RXmw5EA5EwVw@mail.gmail.com/">reported</a>
that the problem is being worked on by the syzbot project.  He pointed to a
<a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/3393#issuecomment-1330305227">bug
report comment</a> from syzkaller (and syzbot) creator Dmitry Vyukov that
was posted at the end of November.  It linked to <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y4WE08+n1sZvSt4M@ZenIV/">yet another
message</a> from Viro complaining about the problem.  Looking further at
the bug comment thread makes it clear that progress is being made on
identifying what to search for and on adding tags to email subject lines to
identify which filesystem is being fuzzed.
</p>

<p>
The thread eventually went completely off the rails, including a message
that seems likely to draw a response from the kernel <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/code-of-conduct.html">code of
conduct</a> committee.  The overall tone of the thread was unfortunate, at
least in spots, but
both Ts'o and Viro (especially the latter) spent a fair amount of time
patiently reiterating the problems 
that have been raised multiple times along the way, albeit at a lower
volume.  Those requests did not go far, so, as Ts'o put it, "<q>maybe
something a bit 
more.... assertive by Al [Viro] is something that will inspire them to
prioritize this feature request</q>".
</p>

<p>
Fuzz testing generates a huge number of reports; in order for the testing
to be effective—useful—those reports have to be acted upon.  Since that is
the goal, it obviously makes sense to create reports that can be quickly
routed to the right people.
This not the first time we have seen <a href="/Articles/904293/">complaints
about fuzzing reports</a>, and in a filesystem context, but hopefully 
we are on track to see improvements soon.

Jeebus, some of the comments posted by the non-kernel-devs read as if they might have been written by a bot with no understanding at all of anything related to how humans and dev time works. (But, hey, maybe they're just "testing" an AI at the expense of kernel devs.)<br>

Though the level of invective in the thread isn’t appropriate, I was working with someone who felt it was helpful to respond to a justifiably-frustrated maintainer with “Calm downnnnnn Sir” and multiple messages full of grating pseudo-puns like “beatles” for “bugs,” I too would have trouble keeping a lid on my temper. Even accounting for possible cultural differences and ESL factors, it’s childish at best and outright disrespectful at worst.<br>
<p>
Automated bug reports are only as good as the routing-to-humans procedure they undergo. Maintainers live and die by the signal/noise ratio in various project fora, and reducing that ratio irritates people, justifiably. While it’s not always great praxis to say “why don’t you just fix $BEHAVIOR with $STRATEGY,” it’s perfectly valid for maintainers to outline what kind of strategy would be useful for their purposes without being expected to fix the fuzzers themselves. <br>

Perhaps Hillf Danton is not a native English speaker as his email address is with a Chinese hosting provider.  The "impenetrable" reply from him is:<br>
<p>
-------<br>
Calm downnnnnn Sir even if this is not the east ender style.<br>
<p>
Frankly no interest here at all wasting any network bandwidth just to get you<br>
interrupted if it would take less than 72 hours to discover one of the beatles<br>
you created. And actually more than double check is needed to ensure who<br>
did that.<br>
-------<br>

Seems likely to mean something like:<br>

Please calm done: aren't British people supposed to be polite?<br>
<p>
I'd have no interest in bothering you if it would take less than 3 days to trace one of your bugs to you, but that's not the case, and it would take even more effort to ensure we'd actually traced the bug to the right person if we tried to do that analysis ourselves.<br>
-------<br>
<p>
Even "translated" it doesn't show the best attitude, but it makes a little more sense and it seems clear that Hillf didn't really understand what was being asked of him.<br>

As a Google engineer (who has nothing to do with syzbot or syzkaller), I tend to suspect this is exacerbated by a cultural difference. At Google, frequent context switching between the browser, the MUA (which is just Gmail, so a tab in the browser), the console, etc., is considered entirely normal and unremarkable. You have to switch between them frequently, or else you'll never get anything done. Meanwhile, on LKML, this is considered horrifying and grossly inefficient (at least by some people, anyway).<br>
<p>
(I have no idea whether Hillf is actually a Google engineer. syzkaller appears to be a Google-owned GitHub repo, so I'm guessing that at least some of the people who work on it are probably Googlers?)<br>

FWIW, he's not in the syzkaller git logs.  And for the record, I don't think that anyone with that attitude ("the Most Holy Tool is an unparalleled blessing upon humanity; only a vile ingrate could possibly find any of its aspects deficient!!!") could be involved in the development of the tool in question.  Cheerleading?  Sure.  Making the actual developers cringe?  You bet.  Contributing?  Not likely. <br>
<p>
Marco Elver is one of the syzkaller developers, so's Alexander Potapenko.  AFAICS, nobody else in that thread is.<br>

You'd be surprised. I've encountered quite a few (secondhand) horror stories of upstreams behaving in exactly that fashion.<br>
<p>
(My usual attitude towards these kinds of disputes tends to look pro-upstream, but it's really more pro-the-people-who-do-the-work-call-the-shots; if upstream doesn't want to make a change, they don't have to, but neither does downstream have to use/package/triage/etc. upstream's work. It would obviously be preferable if everyone got along.)<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; As a Google engineer (who has nothing to do with syzbot or syzkaller), I tend to suspect this is exacerbated by a cultural difference. At Google, frequent context switching between the browser, the MUA (which is just Gmail, so a tab in the browser), the console, etc., is considered entirely normal and unremarkable. You have to switch between them frequently, or else you'll never get anything done. Meanwhile, on LKML, this is considered horrifying and grossly inefficient (at least by some people, anyway).</span><br>
<p>
But you're imposing your workflow on other people ...<br>
<p>
I make no judgement as to whether the tools are "good" or "bad" - different people have different definitions, and personally I'd dump both the browser and gmail in the "bad" category, but just because you are quite happy with your tools, doesn't mean that other people can function efficiently with them.<br>
<p>
For grey-beards, it's likely that the console and MUA are the same tool (emacs).<br>
<p>
I have to work with gmail, slack, and Excel/VBA. When I'm doing "real work" it's almost invariably in Excel's VBA window, and even the context switch to Excel proper is a productivity-damaging one. gmail and slack pretty much get ignored.<br>
<p>
I don't think it really matters what your tools are, what matters is that (if possible) you are working with a favourite tool, and that you can minimise the number of times you switch between tools.<br>
<p>
And another thing the young bucks don't realise, is that the reason greybeards stick to their favourite tools is that OLDER PEOPLE DON'T LEARN SO FAST. As a greybeard myself, I don't give a monkeys what tools other people prefer (so long as it doesn't impact on me), but I can do the job with MY tools of choice in a fraction of the time it would take if *I* used *SOMEONE*ELSE'S* tools of choice. I like to think I could do it faster than them with their choice, but that's arrogance :-)<br>
<p>
(And all the evidence says that people "who can multi-task" are actually much less productive than people who can sit and concentrate without interruption. Case in point, we had something kick off at work yesterday morning, by yesterday evening I had digested the problem, worked out a fix, and rolled it out for testing. My bosses were shocked how fast it was done. But I was allowed to *concentrate*!)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Wol<br>

Maybe, but I don't think you can take this (the right to not demand everybody adapt to your way of working) arbitrarily far. For example, I remember well the golden times when all email was plaintext, but at the point where you are one in a million wanting that because html mail disrupts your workflow, then I'd say it's already your problem, and if you cannot perform properly because of your choices, then it's you who needs to adapt or at least find a workaround.<br>
<p>
That's not to say that I, too, wouldn't find the problem complained of here very real and the response completely impossible to understand or accept <br>

You do realize that anyone e.g. sending patches in HTML mail gets told to resend, don't you?  With pointer to Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst or Documentation/process/email-clients.rst if whoever responds feels like being helpful.  Which, I might add, contains the following bit:<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Gmail (Web GUI)<br>
***************<br>
<p>
Does not work for sending patches.<br>
<p>
Gmail web client converts tabs to spaces automatically.<br>
<p>
At the same time it wraps lines every 78 chars with CRLF style line breaks<br>
although tab2space problem can be solved with external editor.<br>
<p>
Another problem is that Gmail will base64-encode any message that has a<br>
non-ASCII character. That includes things like European names.<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<p>
Might or might not be accurate these days, but that pretty much means "non-starter for kernel development, use their IMAP interface with a real MUA if you are forced to use a gmail account".  Has nothing to do with the age, etc. - see the mentioned files for the real reasons.  If gmail web client has solved these problems nowadays, a patch to Documentation/process/email-clients.rst along the lines of "here's how to set it up so it would do the right thing" would be welcome...<br>

Yes, this happens in the kernel development context, and I'm not saying there's not a good reason for it (although I'm not saying the opposite either!).<br>
<p>
Look, I'm no fan of all the new ways of doing things either. Rather, I just want to point that "it disrupts my/our way of working" only goes so far. It goes a lot more far, of course, in communities where lots of people want to do it like that (or there's people with sufficient power to just say this is how we do it), but even that has its limits...<br>

True. But when "you" are asking "me" to respond to your bug report, "you" need to make that worth my while.  So either a REALLY important bug, or a report that is REALLY easy to work with (or lots of dollars).<br>

      <p>My reading says the problem with the different tools is only the tip of the iceberg.  Yes, the need to switch tools is annoying, but the underlying problem is that relevant information isn't being included up-front.  The fuzz testers know which filesystem they were testing, and the information is present in the dashboard entry that has the more detailed information.  But instead of including that very basic information in the title of the email, they make maintainers dig through the dashboard entry to figure it out.  It's just massively inefficient and makes people much less inclined to pay attention.  If they would just do the absolute most basic thing, like saying in the email title they generated the bug while testing fuzzed NTFS images, it would make life much easier.

As a Googler, I have to put up with this sort of thing (i.e. "here is an email/stderr message/log entry/whatnot, it contains a link, the link points to the actual information") so often that I'm basically immune to caring at this point. It's simply The Way Things Are Done over there.<br>

      <p>An email that points you to the information might be OK if you can at least have some confidence it's about your project.  It's far worse when it's an email to a whole mailing list, most of whom aren't involved.  Expecting people dig through a convoluted process just to figure out if the email is even relevant to them is just ridiculous.

My reaction to that is to dump it in /dev/null. I have enough things to do anyway, it's easy to not find time to go searching down a rabbit warren.<br>

I completely empathise with Viro here :-(<br>
<p>
I've got my RSS reader pointed at my distro's bugzilla because that turns out to be a good way of staying ahead of upcoming problems, and on a good day it's very low volume. On a *bad* day... a flood of hundreds of automated, mostly identical, and dubious-usefulness QA bugs from two different users' buildbots (and an enormous amount of them end up as wontfix landfill after developers waste their time triaging them).<br>

<p>
Danilo Krummrich gave a talk at Kangrejos 2024 focusing on the question of how
the Rust-for-Linux project could improve at getting device and driver
abstractions upstream. As a case study, he used some of his recent work that
attempts to make it possible to write a PCI driver entirely in Rust. There
wasn't time to go into as much detail as he would have liked, but he did
demonstrate that it is possible to interface with the kernel's module loader in
a way that is much harder to
screw up than the current standard approach in C.
</p>

<p>
To give context to the discussion, he started by explaining that his goal was to
make development of Nova (the
<a href="/Articles/990736">
new NVIDIA driver he has been working on</a>) go
smoothly. He opined that Nova would probably be the first "more complex" thing
to go upstream. Luckily, other in-progress efforts to write kernel components in
Rust need some of the same abstractions as
Nova, including
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240322221305.1403600-1-lyude@redhat.com/">
rvkms</a>,
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/nvme-driver">
rnvme</a>,
<a href="/Articles/988438/">
Apple AGX</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1722334569.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/">
rcpufreq-dt</a>. Ultimately, he would like
to provide driver infrastructure that integrates with the kernel, but that takes
advantage of Rust's capabilities where possible.
</p>

<p>
Initially, there was confusion on the mailing list, Krummrich said, about what
the Rust abstractions he wanted to discuss
were meant to represent.
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240618234025.15036-1-dakr%40redhat.com/">
The patch set</a> that spawned the discussion is not really
about abstracting <em>drivers</em> he explained, but about permitting drivers to
access bus types safely — abstractions needed <em>for</em> drivers. A fact which
had proved difficult to communicate via email.
At the end of the discussion, Greg Kroah-Hartman
had called for writing the driver-registration code itself separately, in C.
</p>

<p>
At Kangrejos,
Kroah-Hartman took responsibility for half of the misunderstanding, but said that he did
still think it made sense to implement driver registration itself in C. He said
that it would be a small amount of "safe C" — a comment that prompted
good-natured chuckles from the attending Rust programmers. Krummrich was
sympathetic, but wanted to go through an example of what he was trying to
achieve with the driver abstractions and why.
</p>

<p>
Krummrich showed the code for a simple PCI driver written in C, and then
went through a series of modifications to incrementally rewrite it in Rust.
The simplest change was just to replace the probe and remove functions with
versions written in Rust:
</p>

<pre>
    #[no_mangle]
    unsafe extern "C" fn rust_pci_driver_probe(
        _pdev: *mut bindings::pci_dev,
        _ent: bindings::pci_device_id,
    ) -&gt; core::ffi::c_int {
        pr_info!("Probe Rust PCI driver sample.\n");

        0
    }

    #[no_mangle]
    unsafe extern "C" fn rust_pci_driver_remove(_pdev: *mut bindings::pci_dev) {
        pr_info!("Remove Rust PCI driver sample.\n");
    }
</pre>

<p>
The code was fairly simple, but after showing it, Krummrich explained that
there was actually already a bug in this example that he hadn't noticed until
later: the signature of the Rust functions was incorrect. It didn't cause
problems, because the incorrect parameter was unused, but it still served to
illustrate why he wanted to make interfacing with the kernel's driver system
less error-prone.
</p>

<p>
He also mentioned an issue that didn't show up in this simple example — binding
object lifetimes to driver and module lifetimes, instead of <em>device</em>
lifetimes, such as is sometimes necessary for complex drivers.
Kroah-Hartman thought that it was good for that to be hard, because "we don't
want you to do that". He explained that the kernel tried hard to ensure that
data is bound to data, not to code, and that drivers should use per-device
storage. Krummrich said that the same problem applied to trying to set up
per-device storage, in this case. Ultimately, they both agreed that what they
wanted was simple lifetime handling that bound data (such as cache data) to
other data (such as a specific device), and that the simplest way to integrate
Rust and C code did not make that easy.
</p>

<p>
Krummrich did include the caveat that Nova had some buffers that needed to live
for the lifetime of the module itself, because of how NVIDIA's GPU system
processor handles debugging information. Kroah-Hartman replied that GPUs were "the most
crazy complex hardware out there". So he was fine with GPU drivers needing to do
something out of the ordinary — but normal drivers shouldn't need to.
</p>

<p>
This prompted some discussion of which subsystems might need to do things
differently. Kroah-Hartman agreed that some of the core infrastructure would need more
complicated lifetime management as well. Most drivers are simple I2C or PCI
drivers, however, he said. So it's only a handful of complicated drivers that
need more complex lifetime management.
</p>

<p>
Krummrich then showed how the bindings could be made safer by moving some
of the implementation into Rust; he demonstrated this in stages. The first stage
was to use a macro to declare the module in Rust instead of C. That still left
unsafe functions, the possibility that the driver could forget to unregister
correctly, and some awkwardness with constructing the PCI device ID table.
</p>

<p>
Next, he showed how the uses of unsafe could be centralized to a single helper
library, such that each driver only needs safe functions, with signatures
type-checked by the compiler. The new version involves creating a type that
implements the <tt>pci::Driver</tt> trait, which then takes care of the details
of registering and unregistering the driver, and storing device-specific
information in a type-safe way.
</p>

<p>
There were some more questions about the specific details. Kroah-Hartman asked why
Krummrich had reimplemented a structure in Rust instead of using the version
defined in C; Krummrich said that he didn't want to expose the structure
directly to drivers. Benno Lossin suggested using a type alias, so that it's
still not defined in two places.
</p>

<p>
The most involved part of the code concerned the machinery to make the PCI
device ID table automatically add an appropriate sentinel value to the end at
compile time, so that the whole device ID table can be stored in the binary's
data section — a much more elegant solution than creating a copy of the table at
run time. That ended up requiring the use of some additional intermediate
traits, and made the whole code more than twice as large.
</p>

<p>
Kroah-Hartman said that the code was great, but that the complexity needed to add the
sentinel "sounds crazy". He asked whether there wasn't a simpler way to do it,
but nobody present volunteered a way.
</p>

<p>
Krummrich's example did show that it is definitely possible to build a
driver-binding abstraction that requires no unsafe code in drivers. Such a
driver cannot accidentally forget to unregister, automatically has type-safe
storage associated with each device that it is registered for, does not need to
touch raw pointers (instead receiving bounds-checked smart pointers for the
appropriate PCI buses), and should generally be quite difficult to misuse.
</p>

<p>
The session ran out of time before Krummrich could finish his presentation.
The overall conclusion from Kroah-Hartman was that he wants to see the full example in a
patch set, but that it was a promising start. Krummrich wants this driver
abstraction to be available for Nova and the other Rust drivers that use
the same features, so it seems likely that he'll provide that example soon.

Some recent development on this topic. I was experimenting a different approach that would not require the macros. The const functions within there are still a bit crazy though, because what can be done at CTFE time is a bit limited.<br>
<p>
Link on R4L zulip about this: https://rust-for-linux.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/288089-General/topic/.60DeviceId.60.20without.20macros<br>
<p>
This progress is only made possible very recently by Rust allowing mutable references to be used in CTFE (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129195">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129195</a>) and therefore a lot more (crazy stuff) can be done during const evaluation.<br>

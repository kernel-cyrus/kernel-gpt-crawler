           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 11, 2008</br>

<p>
There's a new kernel tree in town.  The linux-staging tree was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/285599/">announced</a> by Greg Kroah-Hartman
on 10 June.  It is meant to hold drivers and other kernel patches that are
working their way toward the mainline, but still have a ways to go.  The
intention is to collect them all together in one tree to make access and
testing easier for interested developers.
</p>

<p>
According to Kroah-Hartman, linux-staging (or -staging as it will
undoubtedly 
be known) "<q>is an outgrowth of the Linux Driver Project, and the fact
that
there have been some complaints that there is no place for individual
drivers to sit while they get cleaned up and into the proper shape for
merging.</q>"  By collecting the patches in one place, it will increase
their visibility in the kernel community, potentially attracting more
developers to assist in fixing, reviewing, and testing them.
</p>

<p>
The intent is for -staging to house self-contained
patches&mdash;Kroah-Hartman mentions drivers and filesystems&mdash;that
should not affect anyone who is not using them.  Because of that, he is
hoping that -staging can get included in the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/269120/">linux-next</a> tree.  As he says to
Stephen Rothwell, maintainer of -next, in
the announcement:
<div class="BigQuote">
Yes, I know it contains things that will not be included in the
     next release, but the inclusion and basic build testing that is
     provided by your tree is invaluable.  You can place it at the
     end, and if there is even a whiff of a problem in any of the
     patches, you have my full permission to drop them on the floor
     and run away screaming (and let me know please, so I can fix it
     up.)
</div>
</p>

<p>
The -next tree is meant for things that are headed for inclusion in the
"N+1" kernel (where 2.6.N is the release under development), so including
code not meant for that release is bending the rules a bit.  As of this
writing, Rothwell has not responded to the
request to include -staging, but it would clearly benefit those patches to
have a wider audience&mdash;with only a small impact on -next.  There is no
set timeline for patches to move from -staging into mainline, Kroah-Hartman
says: 
<div class="BigQuote">
Based on some of the work that is needed on some of these drivers, it is
much longer than N+2, unless we have some people step up to help out
with the work.  It's almost all janitorial work to do, but I know I
personally don't have enough time to do it all, and can use the help.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The -staging tree is seen as a great place for Kernel Janitors and others
who are interested in learning about kernel development to get their
start.  The announcement notes: "<q>The code in this tree
is in desperate need of cleanups and fixes that can be trivially
found using 'sparse' and 'scripts/checkpatch.pl'.</q>"  In the
process of cleaning up the code, folks can learn how to create patches and
how to get them accepted into a tree.  From there, the hope is that more
difficult tasks will be undertaken&mdash;with -staging or other kernel
code&mdash;leading to a new crop of kernel hackers.
</p>

<p>
The current <a href="/Articles/285600/">status of -staging</a> shows 17
patches, most of which are drivers from the Linux Driver Project.
Kroah-Hartman is actively encouraging more code to be submitted for
-staging, as long as it meets some criteria for the tree.  The tree is
<i>not</i> meant to be a dumping ground for drivers that are being "thrown
over the wall" in hopes that someone else will deal with them.  It is also
not meant for code that is being actively worked on by a group of
developers in another tree somewhere&mdash;the reiser4 filesystem is
mentioned as an 
example&mdash;it is for code that would otherwise languish.
</p>

<p>
The reaction on linux-kernel has so far been favorable, with questions
being asked 
about what kinds of patches are appropriate for the tree, in particular <a
href="/Articles/285678/">new architectures</a>.  The -staging tree fills a
niche that has not yet been covered by other trees.  It also serves
multiple purposes, from giving new developers a starting point to providing
additional reviewing and testing opportunities for new drivers and other
code.  With luck, that will hasten the arrival of new features&mdash;along
with new developers.

Actually, why not include these immature drivers, as long as they are marked using the "Code
maturity" stuff as "scary immature"?  They're more likely to get widespread review and
development help if others can actually see them.

Because 'scary immature' stuff never gets remarked as 'OK'. (See 
EXPERIMENTAL, OBSOLETE et al).

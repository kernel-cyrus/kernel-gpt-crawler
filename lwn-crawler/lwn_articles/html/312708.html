<h1>Justifying FS-Cache</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>December 24, 2008</br>
           </div>
<p>
In what must seem like a never-ending effort, David Howells is once again
trying to get a generic mechanism to do local caching for network
filesystems into the kernel.  The latest version, number 41, of his <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308113/">FS-Cache patches</a> was posted back
in November, so now he is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/312227/">asking
for it to be added to linux-next</a>.  That would mean that the feature was
on-track for the mainline in 2.6.29, but it would appear that
2.6.30&mdash;if ever&mdash;is more likely.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind FS-Cache is to create a way for "slow"
filesystems to cache their data on the local disk, so that repeated
accesses do not require accessing the underlying slow storage.  Howells has been
working on getting it into the kernel for a number of years; our <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/100321/">first article</a> about it appeared
in 2004.  The canonical example of where it might be useful is a
network filesystem on a heavily-used or low bandwidth link&mdash;the cost
of re-reading data from the network may be much higher than retrieving it
from a local disk.  In addition, the cache can be persistent across
reboots, allowing some files to live locally for a very long time.
</p>

<p>
But, Howells already has a fairly large, intrusive patch that is headed for
2.6.29: 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287091/">credentials</a>.  That patch
touches a lot of code in the kernel, in particular the VFS layer. Christoph
Hellwig is 
<a href="/Articles/312736/">concerned</a> about both credentials and FS-Cache
going in at the same time :
<div class="BigQuote">
I don't think we want fscache for .29 yet.  I'd rather let the
credential code settle for one release, and have more time for actually
reviewing it properly and have it 100% ready for .30.
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>
While that would delay the addition of FS-Cache, Andrew Morton has a <a
href="/Articles/312737/">larger concern</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
I don't believe that it has yet been convincingly demonstrated that we
want to merge it at all.
<p>
It's a huuuuuuuuge lump of new code, so it really needs to provide
decent value.  Can we revisit this?  Yet again?  What do we get from
all this?
</div>
</p>

<p>
Morton is worried about adding additional maintenance headaches with
no&mdash;or limited&mdash;benefits.  Using a local disk to cache data from
a remote disk is only useful in some scenarios; it can certainly make
things worse in others.  As Howells <a href="/Articles/312738/">puts
it</a>: "<q>It's a compromise: a trade-off between the loading and
latencies of your 
network vs the loading and latencies of your disk; you sacrifice disk space to
make up for the deficiencies of your network.</q>"  What Morton is
<a href="/Articles/312739/">looking for</a> is a push from users, be that
end users or distributions that 
are shipping the feature.  He would also like to see some benchmarks that
show what gain there is when using FS-Cache.
</p>

<p>
Howells has patiently answered these concerns, pointing at <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/312722/">some benchmarks</a> he had posted in
November that showed some significant savings.  The benchmarks used NFS
over a deliberately slow link (to simulate a heavily used network) and
showed a huge decrease in the time required to read a large file, but was
essentially break-even when operating on a kernel tree.  In the kernel tree
benchmark, though, the reduction in network traffic was significant.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that Red Hat has shipped FS-Cache in
RHEL 5 and there are customers using it, as well as customers interested in
using it as Howells <a href="/Articles/312738/">pointed out</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
We (Red Hat) have shipped it in RHEL-5 and some Fedora releases.  Doing so is
quite an effort, though, precisely because the code is not yet upstream.  We
have customers using it and are gaining more customers who want it.  There
even appear to be CentOS users using it (or at least complaining when it
breaks).
</div>
</p>

<p>
While shipping out-of-tree code is no guarantee that the feature will get
merged&mdash;AppArmor is an excellent counterexample&mdash;actual users
whose needs are being met by a particular feature <i>are</i> a fairly
persuasive argument.  Howells <a href="/Articles/312764/">outlines some
customer use cases</a> for FS-Cache, for example:
<div class="BigQuote">
 We have a number of customers in the entertainment industry who use or
     would like to use this caching infrastructure in their render farms.  They
     use NFS to distribute textures (say a million and a quarter files) to the
     individual rendering units.  FS-Cache allows them to reduce the network
     load by satisfying subsequent NFS READ requests from each rendering unit's
     local cache rather than having to go to the network again.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In all, it would seem that Morton's concerns were addressed.  Whether that
means the path is clear for 2.6.30 or these or other concerns will
come to the fore is a question that will likely have to wait another three
months or so.

Why can't identical behaviour be provided in userspace? The added CPU+latency of extra context switches and memory copies involved in using some evil combination of unionfs and FUSE would be negligibly higher than the delay already faced with pulling something over a network (and especially via a contended pipe).<br>

I have in my head a 100ish line Python script that would accomplish this without resorting to all that C code.<br>

Ignoring that for a second, why can't they just LART their "entertainment industry customers" and have them add 10 lines of code to their app to add caching functionality? This whole thing smells of suck.<br>

Well, the obvious thing that they could implement caching here aside.  Is there some sane way to speed things like /home on NFS up with a local disk?<br>
<p>
Of course one could switch to AFS where the local cache is mandatory, but which might give one weird bugs resulting out of non-POSIX behaviour (e.g. problems with locking).  But I somehow fail to see production-ready alternatives for shared home directories.  What you usually could get are cluster filesystems on some shared storage device, which are not really suitable for the one server - many clients case, where each client node could be turned off at any time.<br>
<p>
Something like FS-Cache could really reduce network traffic and burden for the server here, especially because the clients in my case are equipped with a otherwise mostly unused harddisk.  (The root filesystem is currently rsync'ed on them, which still leaves like 100G per client unused.)  I would be glad for any other suggestion, though.<br>

The problem here is precisely the non-POSIX behaviour. The non-POSIXness of NFS is barely bearable, the one of such an "perhaps you get the offline version, perhaps the online one" is madness.

<p>NFSv4 already has the concept of file delegations (in fact 4.1 includes read-only
directory delegations too), where a client which opens a file
that isn't being accessed by other systems can be granted a delegation to operate
on that file locally and then either commit the final changes to the server when its
done or for the NFS server to recall the delegation if another client requests
access.</p>
<p>So if you are running an HPC cluster, for instance, and a user runs a code in
their home directory by accident (yes, it does happen, sadly) that uses a lot of
temporary files then ideally the server will be able to delegate access to the client
and they don't need to do any of their I/O over NFS..</p>

I'm using it to allow my desktop box to boot from NFS, with (almost) no local storage other than FS caching: it's all on a remote system, because that happens to be a five-disk RAID-6 (md) array which I trust my data with more than a single-disk desktop: but I want that desktop to be local-disk fast nearly all the time.<br>

Although Flash is fast to read, it's slow to write. What if user's mostly

She doesn't use FS-Cache.

That the FS-Cache configuration doesn't help this user doesn't mean it doesn't help anyone.

Well, it's not really that slow even when it is slower than reading. Here are the stats for my Intel 80GB SSD (on a RHEL5 2.6.18 kernel) with 2 threads:<br>
<p>
    Sequential writes: 57MB/sec<br>
    Sequential reads: 170MB/sec<br>
    Random reads: 199MB/sec<br>
    Mixed workload (70%R, 30%W): 69MB/sec<br>
    Random writes: 72MB/sec<br>
<p>
And with 16 treads:<br>
<p>
    Sequential writes: 48MB/sec<br>
    Sequential reads: 208MB/sec<br>
    Random reads: 174MB/sec<br>
    Mixed workload (70%R, 30%W): 144MB/sec<br>
    Random writes: 40MB/sec<br>
<p>
Granted, with 16 threads the results are less flattering. But for a single disk, it is not slow compared to other laptop disks.<br>

SSD slow at write? Single X25-E can write at 170 MB/s, and Micron RealSSD tops at 250MB/s. Show me traditional disk capable of this. And it's general purpose SSD! I don't know how fast could be write-optimized flash used in hybrid storage NASes, like Sun Storage 7000 line.<br>
<p>
There are some awesome benchmark numbers coming from system running ZFS with (~) external log and second level cache. They are coming mostly from extreme number IOPS delivered by flash, but interesting anyway. Just search for L2ARC and slog (separate intent log) results.<br>

For the record, this shows how external caching on fast SSD helps performance: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/entry/l2arc_screenshots">http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/entry/l2arc_screenshots</a><br>
Be aware that warming up cache take hours.<br>

If the version of FS-Cache in RHEL5 is anything to go by, then it seems far from ready for prime time, with quite regular panicing when I tried it.<br>

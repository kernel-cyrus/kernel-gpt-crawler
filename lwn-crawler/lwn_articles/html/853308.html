<p><a
href="https://zonedstorage.io/introduction/zoned-storage/">Zoned
block devices</a> have some unfamiliar characteristics that result from
compromises made in the name of higher storage density.  They are divided
into zones, some or all of which do not support random access for write
operations.  Instead, these "sequential" zones can only be written in
order, from the first block to the last.  This constraint poses a new
challenge for filesystems, which are normally designed with the assumption
that storage blocks can be written in any order.  It is thus not surprising
that zoned-device support in mainstream filesystems in Linux has been slow
in coming; that is changing, though, with the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1612433345.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/">addition</a>
of support for zoned block devices to Btrfs in Linux&nbsp;5.12.</p>

<p>
The only way to overwrite data in a zoned drive's sequential zone is to
reset the write pointer to the beginning of the zone, which immediately
erases the entire content of that zone. On the other hand, random read
access is fully supported.   Many zoned devices also provide some
"conventional" zones that support random read and write operations.
Zoned devices were first seen in the form of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording">shingled
magnetic recording</a> (SMR) drives; the kernel has low-level support for
these devices.  Zoned devices using flash storage also exist; they trade
flexibility for reduced hardware complexity.  These devices were added to
the NVMe standard in the form of <a
href="https://zonedstorage.io/introduction/zns/">the Zoned Namespaces (ZNS)
command set</a>, which has been supported in Linux since the 5.9 release.
<p>

<p>Work has been going on for a number of years to support zoned
drives in Linux filesystems. Copy-on-write filesystems should be
easier to adapt, as they are designed to avoid overwriting data
blocks. Among the existing Linux filesystems, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS">F2FS</a> already supports
zoned devices, and allows normal operations on such devices (but
requires that the drive provide at least one conventional zone). In
addition, zonefs, a special filesystem for zoned devices, <a
href="/Articles/794364/">was included</a> in the 5.6 kernel.
Using zonefs requires applications designed for this
purpose, as the filesystem does not support the creation of normal files.
Some types of applications do fit the model well, however, for example
those with log-structured data.</p>

<p>
Support for zoned devices in more mainstream filesystems has also been
in progress in recent years. This is the case for Btrfs, which has seen
the support of zoned devices in the works since at least 2019, when
Noahiro Aota <a href="/Articles/788851/">presented the
status</a> of this work at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit. He has continued the work since, and
finally has seen the 15th revision merged into 5.12.</p>

<h4>Changing Btrfs</h4>

<p>Supporting zoned devices requires changes in the way the filesystem
structures are organized on disk, as it is often impossible to
overwrite existing data.  One implication is that data structures that 
change over time must either be placed in a conventional zone or be
implemented 
in a way that does not require them to be in a single, fixed location.
<p>
The only on-disk structure that had a fixed location in Btrfs was
the superblock, which may have <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/On-disk_Format#Superblock">up
to two copies</a>. In the case of zoned devices, an easy solution
would be to require the availability of conventional zones for the
superblock and its copies. However, the location of the second copy <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-btrfs/5aa30b45e2e29018e19e47181586f3f436759b69.1605007036.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/">falls
into a sequential zone</a> on many existing devices; in addition, devices
with no conventional zones should also be supported. For those reasons,
Aota implemented a log-based superblock using two
zones as circular buffers to <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/SN4PR0401MB35987EE941FA59E2ECB8D7269B8C9@SN4PR0401MB3598.namprd04.prod.outlook.com/">protect
against power failures</a>. The filesystem writes the updated superblocks
sequentially to the first zone, and switches to the second one when the
first one is full. It can then reset the first zone safely.</p>

<p>Another structure that required changes was the 
tree log. Blocks for this log were allocated together with other types of
metadata blocks; since the tree log is written at a different time than
other metadata, this approach would generate non-sequential writes. The
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/4a02c3ff283a1c2d71bfa3b0a7135b062af7385e.1612434091.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/">solution</a>
is to separate the tree-log blocks from the other metadata; then each
data stream can be written separately and sequentially.</p>

<p>At the lower level, other changes impact Btrfs chunks
(also called block groups), which are a Btrfs data structure that
represents a range of data blocks on disk. In the case of zoned Btrfs,
the default chunk size was changed so that it is aligned to the zone size.
The allocation of blocks in a chunk also changes to meet the zoned-device
requirements: it becomes sequential from the beginning of the 
chunk. If blocks are freed behind the allocation pointer, they will be
ignored by further allocations. As a result, blocks will be always
allocated sequentially. The zone of a specific chunk will be allowed
for reuse (reset) only when all blocks in the chunk are freed.</p>

<p>In addition to the data-layout modifications, Btrfs will
write to sequential zones using  the "zone append" command (represented by
the <tt>REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND</tt>
block-device operation) on the underlying device instead of using a simple
write.  This command needs a zone to operate on, but does not require a
write pointer; it returns address of the written block.  This means that the
order in which structures are written
does not matter and a block-group lock is not required; the
performance improvement reported by Aota in the cover letter is 36%
for 4KB random writes.</p>

<p>With the patch set, Btrfs supports NVMe drives with the ZNS
functionality natively, and the <tt>sd</tt> driver provides emulation
of the zoned command set for SAS and SATA hard drives.</p>

<h4>How it works in 5.12</h4>

<p>The current zoned-device support shows a number of limitations and areas
needing  further improvements. The high-level list appears in the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-btrfs/cover.1613417746.git.dsterba%40suse.com/">merge
request for 5.12</a>, and the complete one in the cover letter.</p>

<p>The first issue that users may face is that 5.12
supports only the <i>single</i> Btrfs <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/mkfs.btrfs#PROFILES">profile</a>.
That means no support for features like data duplication and RAID. The
difficulty of 
supporting other profiles lies in the need to handle separate
logical addresses for the same data in different zones. The example Aota
gives in the 
cover letter is the DUP profile (duplicating data). In this case, when
the filesystem issues an append command, two zones may respond with
different offsets.</p>

<p>Administrators should be also aware that if a volume contains
multiple zoned disks, the zone sizes for all disks should be the
same.</p>

<p>The current <a
href="https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs"><tt>btrfs-progs</tt></a>
release does not yet support zoned devices; a branch with that support can
be found in <a
href="https://github.com/naota/btrfs-progs/tree/btrfs-zoned">Aota's
repository</a>. 

<p>
I tested a zoned Btrfs filesystem alongside a non-zoned one, using
same size partitions on a SATA drive. The zoned device was emulated.

To create a zoned Btrfs filesystem, one needs to use Aota's version of
<tt>mkfs.btrfs</tt> 
with the <tt>-O&nbsp;zoned</tt> option, but also force data and metadata
into the "single" profile:</p>
<pre>
    mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1 -O zoned -d single -m single
</pre>

<p>
The two filesystems worked the same way for the most part.
The performance was also roughly the same. Btrfs features like
creating snapshots also worked equally well on zoned and non-zoned devices.
The only difference one could notice is higher space usage on the zoned
filesystem, as would be expected.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>Zoned block devices behave differently than the traditional ones, so
there is no surprise that a filesystem requires layout changes to support
those devices, and that the development took many months. For Btrfs, the
basic support is present now, so interested users may test it. This support
has limitations, however, and we can expect that additional features will
be added in upcoming kernel versions.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The nocow attribute is sticky and is not a hint. That snapshotting of nocow files write works because first write to a nocow file on the new snapshot will do one time cow, the original file is unaffected.<br>

      I would expect that btrfs to work more efficiently on a zone interface on flash/SMR than on a block interface that's then mapped by a FTL (or it's SMR equivalent) to zone-like hardware like flash and SMR HDDs.  However, I guess that btrfs on ZNS emulated on a SATA block interface to whatever is below will eliminate any such advantage, so it's a good result for the patch that there is no slowdown from using it in that setting.

It can be queried from the device, but of course you need one to do that.<br>

The other reply to your comment is about right.

Yeah that&#x27;s a bit annoying but at least WDC folks share what they can so we have rough estimates for the near future and set the limits and offsets based on some guesswork. Perhaps the zone size is an unimportant detail for end user and the only people who care about that are developers implemening zoned support. Even wikipedia points for typical zone size to freebsd manual page of zonectl. I&#x27;d expect to find the answer at <a href="https://zonedstorage.io/faq/faq/">https://zonedstorage.io/faq/faq/</a>. The ZNS devices (non-rotational) are now being available, <a href="https://zonedstorage.io/introduction/zns/#zone-capacity-and-zone-size">https://zonedstorage.io/introduction/zns/#zone-capacity-a...</a> does not mention any concrete numbers.<br>

&quot;With the patch set, Btrfs supports NVMe drives with the ZNS functionality natively, and the sd driver provides emulation of the zoned command set for SAS and SATA hard drives.&quot;<br>
<p>
Emulation? Not really, unless you are talking about zone append.<br>
SCSI (t10) has its own standard for how to talk to zoned devices called ZBC. Ditto for ATA (t13) called ZAC. Both those standards predate ZNS. Further NVMe&#x27;s multiple queues don&#x27;t guarantee write ordering which gives zoned storage a real (NVMe only) headache. So they (a big disk company) had to invent &quot;zone append&quot; in which you tell storage that you want to write data and at completion the storage device tells you where it was written. Best not to get a transport error on that completion.<br>

<h1>The first half of the 5.2 merge window</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 10, 2019</br>
           </div>
When he <a href="/Articles/787556/">released the 5.1 kernel</a>, Linus
Torvalds noted that he had a family event happening in the middle of the
5.2 merge window and that he would be offline for a few days in the middle.
He appears to be trying to make up for lost time before it happens: over
8,300 non-merge changesets have found their way into the mainline in the
first four days.  As always, there is a wide
variety of work happening all over the kernel tree.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> On x86-64 systems, crash-dump kernels could only be placed in memory
     below 896MB; in 5.2, that limit has been removed.  This will break
     with ancient versions of kexec-tools, but it appears that those
     versions are unable to work with current kernels anyway.
<li> A lot of work has been done to eliminate the final places where the
     kernel might execute code from a writable mapping, closing a number of
     potential holes that could be exploited in an attack.
<li> The s390 architecture now supports kernel address-space layout
     randomization and signature verification in
     <tt>kexec_file_load()</tt>.
<li> The PA-RISC architecture now supports the KGDB kernel debugger, jump
     labels, and kprobes.
<li> The MIPS32 architecture has gained a just-in-time compiler for the
     eBPF virtual machine.

<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>clone()</tt> system call has a new <tt>CLONE_PIDFD</tt> flag.
     When it is present, the return value to the parent will be a file
     descriptor representing the newly created child process; this
     descriptor (a "pidfd") can be used for <a
     href="/Articles/784831/">race-free 
     process signaling</a> among other things.
<li> The kernel now exports the attributes of the memory attached to each
     node in sysfs, allowing user space to understand how different memory
     banks on heterogeneous-memory systems will perform.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e1cf33aafb84">this commit</a> and
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/13bac55ef7ae">this commit</a> for
     details and documentation.  Note that this work appears to be
     independent of the <a href="/Articles/787326/">heterogeneous memory
     work</a> discussed at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
     Memory-Management Summit.
<li> The BPF verifier has seen some optimization work that yields a 20x
     speedup on large programs.  That has enabled an increase in the
     maximum program size (for the root user) from 4096 instructions to
     1,000,000.
<li> BPF programs may now access global data; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d859900c4c56">this commit
     changelog</a> for some details.
<li> It is now possible to <a href="/Articles/785263/">install a BPF
     program to control changes to sysctl knobs</a>.  See <a
     href="/Articles/787994/">Documentation/bpf/prog_cgroup_sysctl.rst</a>
     for information on the API for these programs.
</ul>


<h4>Filesystems and block layer</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The XFS filesystem has gained a health-tracking infrastructure and
     a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command to query the health status of a
     filesystem.  It has not, however, gained any documentation describing
     this feature or how to use it.
<li> The BFQ I/O scheduler has seen <a href="/Articles/784267/">another set
     of significant performance improvements</a>. 
<li> The io_uring mechanism has a new operation,
     <tt>IORING_OP_SYNC_FILE_RANGE</tt>, which performs the equivalent of a
     <a
     href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync_file_range.2.html"><tt>sync_file_range()</tt></a>
     system call.  It is also now possible to register an eventfd with an
     io_uring and get notifications when operations complete.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/759499/">new system calls for filesystem
     mounting</a> have finally made it into the mainline kernel.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f1b5618e013a">This commit</a>
     contains a sample program showing how to use them.
<li> The ext4 filesystem has gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/784041/">case-insensitive lookups</a>.  As part of
     that work, the kernel now has <a href="/Articles/784124/">generic
     support for UTF-8 string handling</a>.
<li> The CIFS filesystem now supports the <tt>FIEMAP</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt>
     operation for efficient extent mapping.
</ul>

<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Counters</b>: there is now a generic interface for devices that
     count things; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/09e7d4ed8991">this commit</a> for
     interface documentation and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ea2b23b89579">this one</a> for
     sysfs documentation.  Supported devices include
     ACCES 104-QUAD-8, STM32 Timer encoders,
     STM32 LP Timer encoders, and
     FlexTimer module quadrature decoders.
<li> <b>Fieldbus</b>:
     The kernel now supports the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldbus">Fieldbus</a> protocol
     and, in particular, the
     HMS Anybus-S, Arcx Anybus-S, and HMS Profinet IRT controllers.
<li> <b>Graphics</b>: the kernel finally has support for ARM Mali GPUs.
     Two new drivers have been merged: Lima for older GPUs and Panfrost for
     the more recent ones.
     Also added was support for
     Ronbo Electronics RB070D30 panels,
     Feiyang FY07024DI26A30-D MIPI-DSI LCD panels,
     Rocktech JH057N00900 MIPI touchscreen panels, and
     ASPEED BMC display controllers.
<li> <b>Industrial I/O</b>:
     MaxSonar I2CXL family ultrasonic sensors,
     Maxim MAX31856 thermocouple temperature sensors, 
     NXP FXAS21002C gyro sensors, and
     Texas Instruments ADS8344 analog-to-digital converters.
<li> <b>Input</b>: users of Logitech devices with non-unifying receivers
     should notice an improvement of support for various device features;
     the input layer now interacts directly with the devices rather than
     relying on the HID emulation in the receiver.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     ARM SMMUv3 performance monitor counter groups,
     Cirrus Logic Lochnagar2 temperature, voltage and current sensors,
     Infineon IR38064 voltage regulators,
     Intersil ISL68137 PWM controllers,
     Xilinx Zynq quad-SPI controllers,
     Daktronics KPC DMA controllers,
     Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC bridges,
     STMicroelectronics STM32 factory-programmed memory,
     Texas Instruments LM3532 backlight controllers,
     Amlogic G12a-based MDIO bus multiplexers,
     Milbeaut USIO/UART serial ports,
     SiFive UARTs,
     STMicroelectronics MIPID02 CSI-2 to parallel bridges,
     Amlogic Meson G12A AO CEC controllers, and
     Amazon elastic fabric adapters.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     MediaTek HCI MT7663S and MT7668S SDIO Bluetooth interfaces,
     NXP SJA1105 Ethernet switches,
     Realtek 802.11ac wireless interfaces, and
     MediaTek MT7615E wireless interfaces.
<li> <b>Pin control</b>:
     Cirrus Logic Lochnagar pin controllers,
     Mediatek MT8516 pin controllers, and
     Bitmain BM1880 pin controllers.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     Support for audio devices running Intel's <a
     href="/Articles/749888/">Sound Open Firmware</a> has landed in the
     mainline.  Also supported are Microchip inter-IC sound controllers.
<li> <b>USB</b>:
     Broadcom Stingray USB PHYs,
     Amlogic G12A USB PHYs,
     MediaTek UFS M-PHYs,
     Texas Instruments AM654 SerDes PHYs, and
     Hisilicon HI3660 USB PHYs.
<li> <b>Note also</b> that the support for legacy IDE devices has been
     deprecated, with an eye toward removal in 2021.  If there is anybody
     out there still using IDE devices that have not been converted over to
     libata support, now is the time to start saying something.
</ul>


<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>mitigations=</tt> command-line option provides simplified
     control over which speculative-execution vulnerability defenses are
     enabled.  Setting it to <tt>off</tt> disables mitigations entirely.
     The default option of <tt>auto</tt> turns mitigations on, but will not
     affect whether hyperthreading is enabled; <tt>auto,nosmt</tt> will
     also disable hyperthreading if a mitigation requires that.
<li> The elliptic curve Russian digital signature algorithm (GOST R
     34.10-2012, RFC 7091, ISO/IEC 14888-3) is now supported.
<li> The work to mark all implicit fall-through cases in <tt>switch</tt>
     statements is <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b4b52b881cf0">almost complete</a>
     in 5.2, with only 32 cases left to be addressed.  Once they are done,
     it will be possible to enable the <tt>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</tt>
     option on kernel builds to prevent them from coming back.
</ul>
<p>



<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>objtool</tt> utility now tracks code that disables supervisor
     mode access protection (SMAP, which prevents the kernel from accessing
     user-space data) to ensure that it is re-enabled before calling any
     other functions.  It is relatively easy to end up in surprising parts
     of the kernel with SMAP disabled, leading to potential security holes;
     this change should prevent that from happening.
<li> The interrupt and exception stacks on x86-64 systems now have guard
     pages, allowing stack overflows to be reliably caught and dealt with.
     The older probabilistic stack-overflow checking option has been
     removed, since it is no longer needed.
<li> The new <tt>VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS</tt> VMA flag will cause the kernel to
     immediately clear TLB entries and direct-map permissions for memory
     with execute permissions.  This flag can be set with
     <tt>set_vm_flush_reset_perms()</tt> or at allocation time.
<li> The <tt>mmiowb()</tt> primitive, which inserts a barrier for
     memory-mapped I/O operations, <a href="/Articles/780710/">has been
     removed</a> in favor of infrastructure that handles barriers
     automatically when they are needed.
<li> The new inode method <tt>free_inode()</tt> serves as a better version
     of <tt>destroy_inode()</tt> when RCU is involved; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fdb0da89f4ba">this commit</a> for
     some details.  Most filesystems have been converted over to this
     function. 
<li> Device tree authors may want to have a look at the new <a
     href="/Articles/787993/">dos and don'ts document</a> on how to write
     bindings.
</ul>
<p>

The usual schedule would have the 5.2 merge window closing on May&nbsp;19,
with the final 5.2 release happening in the first half of July.  It seems
like the list of changes for the second half of this merge window will be
smaller than the first, but we'll catch up with it regardless once the
window has closed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Ahh, so 'legacy' in the sense of "still shows up as /dev/hda and not /dev/sda"? I was already afraid they were going to deprecate support for IDE in general.<br>

New filesystem ones are x86 only now but I hope that other archs will follow in 5.2 cycle. <br>

Actually, the clone() system call will not return a file descriptor as its return value even if the CLONE_PIDFD flag is present; the return value is always the PID. Instead, if the CLONE_PIDFD is present, a file descriptor will be passed as clone's parent_tidptr argument. See samples/pidfd/pidfd-metadata.c for an example of how this works.<br>

Ugh. This kind of API makes me mad. Why not just add a new syscall with clear semantics?!?<br>

From my understanding a clone2 is being worked on as we speak. But it should be noted that there are plenty of examples of "new syscalls with clear semantics" that are still painful (openat is a good example -- it copied the [broken] behaviour of open(2) ignoring any unknown flags).<br>

The linux.conf.au security miniconf hosted a number of talks on specific
security technologies, many of which have been covered here in the past.
The final event of the day, though, was a panel discussion covering a wide
variety of security issues.  Panellists Casey Schaufler (who also
doubled as moderator), Russell Coker, James Morris, Z. Cliffe Schreuders,
and Kentaro Takeda discussed module stacking, increasing the use of
security technology, authoritative hooks, and more.
<p>

Module stacking was the first topic of interest.  "Stacking" refers to the
practice of loading more than one security module, allowing each of them to

<a href="/Articles/315975/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/lca2009/SecurityPanel-sm.jpg" width=300 height=153
alt="SecurityPanel" align="right" border=0></a>

participate in security decisions.  The technique has its appeal; it would
allow more tightly-focused modules to be written and mixed together in
interesting ways.  But stacking of security modules is not currently
supported in the Linux kernel - a situation which does not appear to be set
to change anytime soon.
<p>
Casey, who had raised the issue,  answered his own question by saying that
he would like to see module 
stacking supported; it would add to the flexibility of the system.  His
preferred solution would involve the creation of a special security module
which would arbitrate between all the others, deciding which modules get to
make decisions in each specific situation.  As far as your editor knows,
this stacker module does not actually exist yet.
<p>
Russell's response was simpler: he would like to see a reasonable number of
users actually running with a single security module first.  Once that
problem has been solved, one can move on to more complicated tasks.
<p>
James raised the issue of the "composability problem": the combination of
security technologies in ways not anticipated by their designers can lead
to unpredictable results.  People working on security technologies
<i>hate</i> unpredictable results.  The SELinux developers tried to deal
with this problem by turning SELinux into the one true security module
(your editor's term, not James's), so that any security situation could be
addressed within a single module.  This aspect of SELinux is not really
being used, though.
<p>
Cliffe's response was that stacking should be allowed, if only to
discourage developers from adding parallel sets of hooks to support their
own security technologies.  James responded, though, that many
security-related modules (integrity management, say, or malware scanning)
really should have their own API.  Kentaro noted that the TOMOYO Linux
developers really want their work to be able to coexist with other modules,
so he would like to see stacking supported as well.
<p>

From there, your editor asked the panelists to follow up on Russell's
point: what is it going to take to get people to actually use the security
technologies that we have now?  A security module does little good if
frustrated system administrators simply turn it off as soon as it gets in
their way.
Casey responded that it was unfortunate that the first security module made
available for widespread use (SELinux) was such a complex one.  A lot of people
really don't need all of the capability which is provided by SELinux.  A
set of smaller, more understandable security modules would have gained
acceptance much more easily.  SELinux is far too monolithic; there is no
easy way into it.
<p>
Russell, instead, suggested that we should look at the history of
security.  Once it was accepted that all important processes would run as
root.  Over time, it has been made clear that this is a bad idea, and
various system daemons have been moved to other user IDs.  Ill-advised
practices like running IRC clients as root have been banned.  It has taken
a long education process to get to this point; this process will have to
continue for technologies like SELinux.  James agreed that time was
required, and noted that, over time, use of SELinux is increasing.  Some
simple things, like getting administrators to shift SELinux to permissive
mode when they run into problems rather than turning it off altogether, can
also help in this regard.
<p>
In the longer term, though, there is still a need for higher-level tools.
The current SELinux policy interface is really the assembly language of
(SELinux-based) security; most users should not have to deal with the
system at that level.  Cliffe agreed, saying that blaming users for turning
off security is the wrong thing to do.  It is the fault of the security
developers, who have not made their tools sufficiently easy to use.
Security must be built using higher-level abstractions which users can
understand; the technology he is working on (<a
href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/ax37901032742234/">FBAC-LSM</a>),
is designed 
with this goal in mind.  Kentaro added that most users don't want to have
to think about security; it needs to be implemented so that they don't have
to.
<p>

From there the panellists went into a rather cloudy discussion of cloud
computing.  James, after asking what that term really meant, noted that
there are useful things to be done in this area, and that Linux offers a
number of useful technologies, such as namespaces, which can help.  There
is, though, a lot of work to be done.  Cliffe added that the
infrastructure is there for people who want to work on secure cloud
computing, but that module stacking would make it easier.  Kentaro stated
that cloud computing is, in fact, one of the core targets for his work;
there is a lot of space for Linux here.  We do, however, need to be sure to
avoid creating single points of failure, which can bring the whole thing
down.  Casey's take on this topic was that cloud computing is likely to
bring cryptography back to the forefront of security research; when all of
your data is on other people's servers, that data needs to be well
protected.
<p>
Russell took a different tack, noting that the security of a number of
current cloud offerings is substandard.  They often provide distributions
which no longer receive security support, and they provide lots of
unpatched software.  They are insecure by default and "ripe for
harvesting," but it is not easy, in such environments, for even a
relatively high-clue user to figure out how to secure things.  The real
problem, he says, is that there is no business model for better security,
so "cloud" providers are not investing in that area.

<p>
A member of the audience asked about authoritative hooks.  These hooks were
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1108/kernel.php3">a contentious issue</a>
early in the development of the Linux security 
module architecture.  LSM is current designed to allow restrictive hooks
only: a security module can only make policy tighter than basic Linux
discretionary access control would allow.  The thinking is that, with
restrictive hooks only, a buggy security module cannot make things worse
than they were before.  Authoritative hooks would, instead, let a security
module empower a process to do things which would not otherwise be
allowed.
<p>

<span class="PullQuote">
<span class="invisible">[PULL QUOTE: </span>
This policy has not slowed down proprietary security modules,
and, at this point, a model 
allowing authoritative hooks would be better.  Making that change would be
"a really big deal," though.
<span class="invisible"> END QUOTE]</span>
</span>

Casey reiterated the history behind the current "no authoritative hooks"
policy, adding that the kernel developers also feared that authoritative
hooks would make the LSM API more suitable for abuse by binary-only
modules.  Indeed, he says that was the primary reason for disallowing those
hooks.  But this policy has not slowed down proprietary security modules,
and, at this point, a model 
allowing authoritative hooks would be better.  Making that change would be
"a really big deal," though.  Russell agreed that the "irrational fear" of
authoritative hooks remains widespread, but the reassurance provided by their
absence may be worth it in the end.  Both Cliffe and Kentaro
thought that interesting things could be done with authoritative hooks, and
that it would be a good time to review just how Linux security modules
work.
<p>

There was a brief discussion on the feeling that the LSM API is too heavily
oriented toward the needs of SELinux.  James agreed that it was
"SELinux-shaped," but noted that this was a natural result of the fact that
SELinux has been the only user of the API for most of its history.  Casey
noted that things have recently been changed to support the needs of his
SMACK module.  There have also been some new hooks added to support
pathname-based modules like TOMOYO Linux and AppArmor.
<p>

Going back to another point raised by Russell, a member of the audience
asked what distributions should do once they go past their end of life.
Should a system with an unsupported kernel refuse to boot, or, at least,
refuse to bring up network interfaces?  Russell came back with the obvious
response: how would one then update such a system?  Casey pointed out that
there are an awful lot of routers out there running old, unsupported
software.  The Internet, he says, is made of expired systems.  Russell
suggested that ISPs should, perhaps, enforce the use of supported software,
and that, maybe, governments could compel such behavior.  Cliffe noted that
all of this really poses another usability problem; what we really need to
do is to make it easy to run a current system.  Quite a bit of progress has
already been made in this direction.
<p>

The final topic had to do with "security mythology," things that "everybody
knows" improve security but which really don't.  Forced password rotation
was one such idea.  Casey said that, for some 20 years, everybody "knew" that
security meant strong cryptography.  There's no real way to address such
things except as a people problem.  Russell added that there's often no
way to know what the consequences of security rules are.  James said that
there is a real need for technical people to push back against silly
security rules.  He likened the problem to the early adoption of Linux,
where people with clue simply deployed it, then asked for forgiveness
later.  Cliffe's point of view is that users do not really know when they
are being asked to make security decisions, so they don't really know when
their actions may be putting their security in peril.  And Kentaro agreed,
noting that we need to find ways to provide more information to users about
what their security technology is really for.
<p>

Thereafter the panel broke up, and the PGP key signing party (done, no
doubt, in a highly secure manner) began.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>That's a sobering thought, and makes me distinctly uneasy.  I wonder if one of them, or some other security experts, might be willing to assemble a set of "rules of thumb" about security, and what constitutes real versus imagined security?  I'm well aware that there's no generalized definitive answer to this question, and it will depend on the context; still, what are some useful ways to evaluate said context, to determine what is, and is not, secure?</p>

the idea of advocating the systems should disable themselves if they decide that they are 'out of date' (whatever that actually means) is very scary<br>
<p>
normally it's only the DRM folks who publicly advocate disabling other people's systems, for free software folks to start saying this is very troubling.<br>
<p>
In addition, just because a system is 'out of date' or 'officially unsupported' does not mean that it is vunerable to anything. If the system is tightly locked down, on a tightly protected network, or just not running much (among other possibilities) there may be nothing at all wrong with letting it continue to run the old 'out of date' software.<br>

      I hope no one seriously proposed that distributors should distribute software that disables the system, as a means of improving security in spite of the owner of that system.

<p>A more legitimate take on this self-destructing system idea is that it's a <em>service</em> to owners who don't want to inadvertently run a vulnerable system.  It might even make sense as a default configuration, but as long as a user who has considered what it means to run out-of-service software can easily turn off the feature, I don't see it as a heinous thing.

<p>If I could buy a carton of milk that won't open after its expiration date, I wouldn't mind that one bit.  It would save me some ruined cereal.

      <p>This was my suggestion. It is difficult in a Q&amp;A to give a complete system specification, but the notion is that the machine's access to the Internet be curtailed when a distribution is used past its end of support date. I've floated this idea before, see the Fedora Devel "autodie" discussion.</p>

<p>It has been well known for decades that software is not a static construction. Even the old "waterfall model" textbooks warn that most of the cost of software is in its ongoing maintenance. The necessary corollary is that using unmaintained software has an increasing risk of incorrect operation.</p>

<p>For Internet-connected software that risk rises considerably after the end of manufacturer support. Internet-connected systems see continuous testing of their security and eventually a known, unpatched flaw will be exploited. In my role in a large ISP I see a lot more "1000-day exploits" of Linux systems than I see "0-day exploits". Which is not to say that I'm not massively appreciative of SELinux's role in subduing 0-day exploits in Fedora (hint, hint Ubuntu).</p>

<p>I don't understand why people mutter about DRM when I put this forward. Implementing the feature in the operating system leaves the user in control. They can disable the feature or upgrade their software, both with no fear of legislative penalty. That is not the case with DRM.</p>

<p>The risks of enforcing distribution expiry lie more with the fact that computers do things, and those things may be important, and interrupting those important things may have a higher risk than preventing misuse of old software. Good user interface design of the "autodie" feature is an important way to minimise that risk.</p>

This reminds me of what I call "scamware".<br>
<p>
Some dubious software vendors that sell software with monthly/yearly support contracts that suddenly stop working (with some cryptic error message) when the client decides to stop paying for the support.<br>
<p>
This was the case of an accounting software (made by a regional ISV) that stopped working with a "too many files" error 2 months after the last payment, but that would work if the system date was set back.<br>
<p>
Now they have an excuse for this: security reasons.<br>

<p>

Modern computing systems can feature multiple types of memory that differ in
their performance characteristics.  The most common example is NUMA
architectures, where memory attached to the local node is faster to access
than memory on other nodes.  Recently, persistent memory has
started appearing in deployed systems as well; this type of memory is
byte-addressable like DRAM, but it is available in larger sizes and is slower to
access, especially for 
writes. This new memory type makes memory allocation even more complicated
for the kernel, driving the need for a method to better manage multiple types of
memory in one system.</p>

<p>NUMA architectures contain some memory that is close to the current CPU,
and some that is further away; remote memory is typically attached to different NUMA nodes.
There is a difference in access performance between local and
remote memory, so the kernel has gained support for NUMA topologies over
the years. To maximize NUMA performance, the kernel tries to keep pages
close to the CPU where they are 
used, but also allows the distribution of virtual memory areas
across the NUMA nodes for deterministic global performance. The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/numa_memory_policy.html">kernel
documentation</a> describes ways that tasks may influence memory
placement on NUMA systems.</p>

<p>

The NUMA mechanism <a href="/Articles/787418/">can be extended</a> to
handle persistent memory as well, but it was not really designed for that
case.  The future may bring even more types of memory, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM)</a>, which stacks DRAM silicon dies and provides
a larger memory bus.  Sooner or later, it seems
that a different approach will be needed.
<p>
Recently, kernel developers have been discussing a possible
solution to the problem of different memory types: adding the notion of
memory tiers. The proposed code extends the NUMA mode to
include features like migrating infrequently used pages to slow memory,
migrating hot pages back to fast memory, and a proposal for a control
mechanism for this feature. 
The changes to the memory-management subsystem to support different tiers are
complex; the developers are discussing three related patch sets, each building
on those that came before.</p>

<h4>Migrating from fast to slow memory</h4>

<p>The first piece of the puzzle takes the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210401183216.443C4443%40viggo.jf.intel.com/">a
patch set</a> posted by Dave Hansen. It improves the memory reclaim
process, which normally kicks in when memory is tight and pushes out the
content of rarely used pages. Hansen said that, in a system with persistent
memory, those pages could instead be migrated from DRAM to the slower
memory, maintaining access to them if they are needed again.  Hansen noted
in the cover letter that this is a partial solution, as migrated pages will
be stuck in slow memory with no path back to faster DRAM. This
mechanism is optional and users will be able to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210401183235.BCC49E8B@viggo.jf.intel.com/">enable
it</a> on-demand with the sysctl <tt>vm.zone_reclaim_mode</tt> or in
<tt>/proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode</tt> with the bitmask set to&nbsp;8.</p>

<p>The patch set received some initial positive reviews, including one <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YHmEm/yHpaqO6khp@dhcp22.suse.cz/">from
Michal Hocko</a>, who noted that the feature could also be useful in
traditional NUMA systems without memory tiers.</p>

<h4>...and back</h4>

<p>The second part of the puzzle is a migration of frequently used
pages from slow to fast memory. This has been <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210311081821.138467-2-ying.huang%40intel.com/">proposed</a>
in a patch set by Huang Ying.</p>

<p>
In current kernels, NUMA balancing works by periodically unmapping
a process's pages. When there is a page fault caused by access to an
unmapped page, the migration code decides
whether the affected page should be moved to the memory node where the page
fault occurred.  The migration decision depends on a number of factors,
including frequency of access and the availability of memory on the
accessing node.

<p>The <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210311081821.138467-5-ying.huang@intel.com/">proposed
patch</a> takes advantage of those page faults to make a better estimation
of which pages are hot; it replaces the current algorithm, which considers
the most
recently accessed pages to be hot. The new estimate uses the elapsed time 
between the time the page was unmapped and the page fault as a measure
of how hot the page is, and offers a sysctl knob to define a
threshold: <tt>kernel.numa_balancing_hot_threshold_ms</tt>. All
pages with a fault latency lower than the threshold will be
considered hot. Correctly setting this threshold may be difficult for the
system administrator, so the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210311081821.138467-7-ying.huang@intel.com/">final
patch</a> of the series implements a method to automatically adjust
it.  To do that, the kernel monitors the number of pages being
migrated with the user-configurable balancing rate
limit <tt>numa_balancing_rate_limit_mbps</tt>, then it increases or
decreases the threshold to bring the rate closer to that value.
<p>

<h4>Controlling memory tiers</h4>

<p>Finally, Tim Chen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1617642417.git.tim.c.chen@linux.intel.com/">submitted</a>
a proposal for management of the configuration of memory tiers, and the
top-level tier containing the fastest memory in particular. The
proposal is based on control groups version&nbsp;1 (Chen noted that support
of version&nbsp;2 is in the works), and monitors the
amount of top-tier memory used by the system and by each control group
individually. It uses soft limits and enables kswapd to move pages to
slower memory in control groups that exceed their soft limit.  Since the
limit is soft, a control group may be allowed to exceed the limit if
top-tier memory is plentiful, but may be quickly cut back to the limit if
that resource is tight.

<p>In Chen's proposal, the soft limit for a control group is called
<tt>toptier_soft_limit_in_bytes</tt>. The code also traces the global
usage of top-tier memory, and if the free memory falls under
<tt>toptier_scale_factor</tt>/10000 of the overall memory of the node it is
attached to,
kswapd will start memory reclaim focused on control groups that
exceed their soft limit.</p>

<p>Hocko <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YGwlGrHtDJPQF7UG@dhcp22.suse.cz/">disliked
the idea of using soft limits</a>:
<blockquote class="bq">
    In the past we have learned that the existing implementation is
unfixable and changing the existing semantic impossible due to
backward compatibility. So I would really prefer the soft limit just
find its rest rather than see new potential use cases.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The likely reasons for Hocko's dislike for soft limits come from the
previous attempts to change the interface (LWN <a
href="/Articles/592045/">covered</a> the discussions in
2013 and 2014). The default soft limit is "unlimited", and this cannot be
changed without a risk of backward compatibility issues.  
</p>

<p>Further into the discussion, Shakeel Butt <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALvZod7StYJCPnWRNLnYQV8S5CBLtE0w4r2rH-wZzNs9jGJSRg@mail.gmail.com/">asked</a>
about a use case where high-priority tasks would obtain better access to the
top-tier memory, which would be more strictly  limited for low-priority
tasks. Yang Shi <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHbLzkrPD6s9vRy89cgQ36e+1cs6JbLqV84se7nnvP9MByizXA@mail.gmail.com/">pointed</a>
to <a href="/Articles/787418/">earlier work</a> that
divided fast and slow memory for different tasks, and concluded
that the solution was hard to use in practice, as it required good
knowledge of the hot and cold memory in the specific system. The
developers discussed more fine-grained control of the type of memory
used, but did not reach a conclusion.
</p>

<p>Before the discussion stopped, Hocko <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YG7ugXZZ9BcXyGGk@dhcp22.suse.cz/">offered
some ideas</a> on how the interface could work: differing types of memory
would be configured into separate NUMA nodes, and tasks could indicate
their preferences for which nodes should host their memory.  Some nodes
might be reclaimed ahead of others when memory pressure hits.
He also further <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YHkw8Ou2VAgHYTjl@dhcp22.suse.cz/">noted</a>
that this mechanism should be generic, not based on the location of persistent
memory in the CPU nodes:
<blockquote class="bq">
    I haven't been proposing per NUMA limits. [...] All I am saying is
that we do not want to have an interface that is tightly bound to any
specific HW setup (fast RAM as a top tier and PMEM as a fallback) that
you have proposed here. We want to have a generic NUMA based
abstraction.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>None of the patch sets have been merged at the moment of this writing, and it
looks like it is not going to happen soon.  Changes in memory
management take time and it seems that the developers need to agree on the
way to control the usage of fast/slow memory in different workloads before
a solution will appear.  The top-tier management patches are explicitly
intended as discussion fodder and are not intended for merging in their
current form in any case.  We will likely see more discussion on the
subject in the coming months.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Swap is not directly addressible, though, so it doesn't really qualify as a "tier" in the sense being discussed here.

How hard would it be to rework swap into just another tier, from the perspective of memory load distribution?<br>
<p>
Obviously, since swap can&#x27;t be mapped for direct access by processes, it&#x27;d never be quite like the others.  But duplicating the code for &quot;move between fast and slow storage&quot; seems like a worse call.  Obviously swap needs a fair amount of unique logic: but so would many other different tiers.  Further, generalizing a single system to allow for arbitrary tiers that can be as different as DRAM and spinning rust swapfiles would mean that the next weird memory system that is dreamed up by the hardware designers can be added without much effort.<br>

      In a sense what you're asking for already exists, it's called "virtual memory".  In that sense it is directly addressible and the kernel will automatically move data in and out.

While virtual memory is transparent to the software which is using it, it is not transparent to the system.   It requires the system to find some real memory that can be (re)used.   This can sometimes be a problem.   With NUMA or persistent memory, that isn&#x27;t a problem.   Memory access may still be slower, but at least it will still work without any immediate work by the system.<br>

The system takes care of that feature too. It&#x27;s fair to say that if a page was being evicted from DRAM, then on a system with just DRAM it would have been swapped instead. So why not assume that everything in slow space is going to be swapped too. Especially if the slow bank is an HBM space then you can migrate DRAM pages into the HBM banks and once you get HBM_LINE_SIZE pages then page them all out in bulk. <br>

I wonder why something closer to the LRU used for the page cache wouldn&#x27;t be used for determining which tier a page belongs in? It kind of seems like the same problem.<br>

I’m not sure of the precise cost of the mechanisms being proposed here, but the page cache LRU is kind of expensive (at least to me as an FS developer optimizing throughput).  I’m not sure that kind of management is appropriate for all of memory.  (But I might be off in terms of scale.)<br>

That sounds like a nice thing to have, but it seems more likely we&#x27;ll have practical nuclear fusion before mainboards that support independent memory channel clocks.<br>

That&#x27;s actually not at all a problem. CPUs talk with DRAM through a memory controller, and it can already change the DRAM frequency. <br>

It&#x27;s *possible*, but at present it also sounds like an incredibly niche feature for a few extra MHz that&#x27;d get shot down by manufacturers just telling users to not use mismatched RAM sticks.<br>
<p>
This idea isn&#x27;t too far from how old CPUs had independent functional units for x87/SSE/3DNow. I&#x27;ve heard urban legends about clever asm programmers wringing a few percent more speed out of those, but it wasn&#x27;t a party trick worth spending silicon on in the long run.<br>

While that sounds appealing, you&#x27;re really just giving up a lot of bandwidth. If you have N sticks of RAM, you want to let the CPU put cache line L on stick L % N.<br>
<p>
What you&#x27;re proposing would put pages A-B on stick 0, B-C on stick 1, etc. It&#x27;s like choosing concatenation instead of RAID 0.<br>

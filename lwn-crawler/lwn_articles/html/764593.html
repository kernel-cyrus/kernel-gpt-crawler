           </div>
From the kernel development community's point of view, hardware
vulnerabilities are not much different from the software variety: either
way, there is a bug that must be fixed in software.  But hardware vendors
tend to take a different view of things.  This divergence has been
reflected in the response to vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre
which was seen by many as being severely mismanaged.  A recent <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809062054450.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">discussion</a>
on the Kernel Summit discussion list has shed some more light on how things
went wrong, and what the development community would like to see happen
when the next hardware vulnerability comes around.
<p>
The definitive story of the response to Meltdown and Spectre has not yet
been written, but a fair amount of information has shown up in bits and
pieces.  Intel was first notified of the problem in July 2017, but didn't
get around to telling anybody in the the Linux community about it until the
end of October.  When that disclosure happened, Intel <a
href="http://www.eweek.com/security/linux-kernel-developer-criticizes-intel-for-meltdown-spectre-response">did
not allow</a> the community to work together to fix it; instead each
distributor (or other vendor) was mostly left on its own and not allowed to
talk to the others.  Only at the end of December, right before the
disclosure (and the year-end holidays), were members of the community
allowed to talk to each other.
<p>
The results of this approach were many, and few were good.  The developers
charged with responding to these problems were isolated and under heavy
stress for two months; they still have not been adequately thanked for the
effort they put in.  Many important stakeholders, including distributions
like Debian and the "tier-two" cloud providers, were not informed at all
prior to the general disclosure and found themselves scrambling.  Different
distributors shipped different fixes, many of which had to be massively
revised before entry into the mainline kernel.  When the dust settled,
there was a lot of anger left simmering in its wake.
<p>
By all accounts, the handling of the recently disclosed <a
href="/Articles/762570/">L1TF vulnerability</a> was much better.  As Thomas
Gleixner, who has been heavily involved in dealing with both sets of
vulnerabilities, <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/alpine.DEB.2.21.1809081037440.1402@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">put
it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Contrary to Meltdown/Spectre Intel informed us about L1Tf halfways
	early and allowed _all_ involved parties to talk to each
	other. There were still some rough edges to bring key people like
	Greg [Kroah-Hartman] in, but that was a minor nuisance compared to
	the whole Meltdown/Spectre mess.
</div>
<p>
So it would appear that something has been learned in the last year.  That
said, the kernel community, under the reasonable impression that the last
hardware vulnerability has not yet been seen, would like to find ways to
make the process work even better.  As is often the case, that seems to
involve convincing vendors to stop sticking with procedures developed for a
proprietary world and deal with the community on something closer to its
own terms.
<p>
One sticking point is non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).  They tend to be a
fact of life in the technology industry, but NDAs do tend to run counter to
how the community actually works.  Resolving a complex hardware
vulnerability can require bringing in more developers late in the game
as the implications of the problem become clear, but the NDA process can
make that difficult or impossible, even if the developers involved are
willing to sign such an agreement.  As Gleixner <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/alpine.DEB.2.21.1809101026160.1402@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">explained</a>,
that complicated the response to L1TF:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We were able to communicate freely between the informed parties and
	their allowed to know kernel developers, even across vendors. But
	there was no simple way to bring in anybody else. It took us
	almost 2 months to get GregKH on board, but there was no way to
	talk to e.g. the BPF folks in time.
</div>
<p>
There were suggestions that a community-wide NDA should be negotiated, but
actually making that happen is a daunting prospect.  Even if the vendors
could be convinced to join such a scheme, many developers are likely to
resist.  Both <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20180908113411.GA3111@kroah.com/">Kroah-Hartman</a>
and <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/CA+55aFwiW9eeC0Z1+HnhCVzH=LmfBQfpdFZ0eYSuHdp5U6bpEg@mail.gmail.com/">Linus
Torvalds</a> have made it clear that they will not be signing any NDAs for
this purpose.
<p>
What may be more likely to happen is the approach taken by Torvalds now:
"<q>I've had a gentleman's agreement with companies - nothing legally
binding, but over the years people have come to realize that the leaks
don't come from me</q>".  The "gentleman's agreement" (perhaps better
called something like "gentlehacker's agreement") idea has some appeal in
both the community and the industry, it seems.  It has been shown to work
with various developers over time, and it is evidently well understood that the
power of an NDA to actually compel non-disclosure is nearly nonexistent.
Dave Hansen <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/cd13e5bd-1d1f-4e0b-4a64-ee6251172888@sr71.net/">noted</a>
that what companies really want is to feel that the information is under
control, and that some companies have managed to find ways to get that
"<q>warm and fuzzy feeling</q>" without using NDAs.  It would be good
for companies that have made progress in this area to share their
experience, he said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I *do* wish that companies like Intel who are actively doing these
	non-NDA things would find some way to share their methods.  Maybe
	the LF can help here by providing a semi-anonymous way for folks to
	share what has worked.  Or, maybe folks like Intel need to just do
	it ourselves.
</div>
<p>
With luck, over time, vendors will figure out the best ways to work with
the community, much like they have with contributions of software.
And, for those that don't, <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/CA+55aFwHH7cN0GXcV7trRs1zgdak+_e8-TyXEsXu62G5V_248A@mail.gmail.com/">Torvalds
said</a> in his usual blunt style, the community should just refuse to deal
with them.
<p>
One issue that remains difficult to address is backporting large security
fixes to the stable kernels.  As a kernel release gets older, this kind of
backport gets harder, to the point that nobody is willing to do it.  Thus,
<a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20180909125554.GB16474@kroah.com/">Kroah-Hartman
explained</a>, the 4.4 kernels do not have the full L1TF fixes, and the
Spectre fixes for 32-bit ARM processors do not go back past 4.18.  When
backports do happen, they tend to bring regressions with them.  It's not
clear that there will ever be a satisfactory solution to this problem,
which is why developers tend to advise upgrading to more recent kernels.

<p>
One thing developers have said repeatedly is that, as noted in the
introduction, hardware vulnerabilities look an awful lot like
software vulnerabilities to kernel developers.  Both must be fixed in
software, and the 
community has some well-exercised procedures for fixing vulnerabilities in
software.  Those procedures include finding the developers whose expertise
is needed to address a specific problem and telling them what they need to
know.  Many kernel developers have helped to fix vulnerabilities under this
system, with minimal leakage of sensitive information prior to the official
disclosure.  Once vendors realize that the community's process works and
can be trusted, the response to this type of problem will go much more
smoothly for everybody involved.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

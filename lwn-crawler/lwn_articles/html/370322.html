<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 20, 2010</br>
           </div>
Tracing support in Linux has made a great deal of progress over the course
of the last year or so.  One important feature still lacks support in the
mainline kernel, though: seamless, combined tracing of user-space execution
along with the kernel.  The subsystem which is meant to support this
feature - utrace - has <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325180/">run into a
number of roadblocks</a> on its way into the mainline.  Now a higher-level
feature, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/369358/">uprobes</a>, has been
proposed as a solution for dynamic probing of user-space programs.  All
told, the combination shows a lot of progress toward inclusion, but the
resulting 
discussion suggests that there are still problems to be overcome before
this code will be merged.

<p>
This version of uprobes is actually two independent modules which address
the problem at different levels.  The lower-level piece is called "UBP,"
for user-space break points; its job is to handle the actual placement of
probes into user-space processes.  The developers reasoned that there might
be additional users of user-space probes in the future, so the facilities
for the placement and removal of those probes were carved out separately.
<p>
On top of UBP is the actual uprobes code, which handles higher-level
details.  Uprobes arbitrates between multiple users of breakpoints, even if
two users want to place a probe at the same location.  It uses utrace to
ensure that 
processes are not running in an area which is about to have a probe
inserted, and deals with the case of multiple processes running the same
code where some are being traced and others are not.  The uprobe code is
also in charge of actually calling the probe function when a probe is hit
and recovering properly if that function behaves poorly.
<p>
This separation is the first point of contention; Peter Zijlstra (who has
been the main reviewer of this code so far) sees uprobes as an unnecessary glue
layer which could be eliminated.  Peter would rather see any needed
features pushed down into UBP, after which the higher-level code could
be dropped.  The uprobes developers disagree, though, saying that the
functions implemented at that level are necessary and cannot really be
eliminated.  This part of the discussion kind of died out, but it doesn't
look like the developers are inclined to make major changes here.
<p>
The next problem is with the implementation of the probes themselves.  When
a probe is placed in a user-space program, the instruction at the probed
location is overwritten by a breakpoint.  When the breakpoint is hit, the
probe handler function is invoked; once it returns, the replaced
instruction must be executed somehow.  A simple implementation would put
that instruction back into its original location, single-step through it,
then restore the breakpoint once again.  That approach fails, though, if
there is a second process (or thread) running the probed code.  If that
second process executes through the probed area while the probe has been
removed, the associated event will be lost.
<p>
So the uprobes developers took a separate approach, called "single-step out
of line" or "execute out of line" (XOL).  A separate region of memory is
set up for the purpose of holding instructions which have been displaced by
probe breakpoints.  When one of those instructions is to be executed, it is
run (again, in single-step mode) out of this separate area; after that,
control returns after the probe location.  This solution allows a probe to
work with multiple processes at the same time.
<p>
The problem is this: the memory containing the XOL instructions must be in
the probed process's address space.  So the XOL code adds a virtual memory
area (VMA) to the process, reserving a range of address space for this purpose.
This works, but it strikes some observers as inelegant at best, and
potentially disruptive at worst.  Currently, the layout of a process's
address space is almost entirely under the control of the process itself.
The injection of a special kernel VMA can perturb the process's control of
its address space, causing other VMAs to move or conflicting with an
attempt by the process to place a VMA at a specific location.  Debuggers
are often known to distort application behavior (leading to "heisenbugs"
which disappear when somebody attempts to observe them directly), but
tracing, which is meant to work on production systems, should really
minimize such distortions.  Peter also dislikes the precedent of kernel
code messing with a process's address space.  Finally, on 32-bit systems,
losing even a small amount of address space to a kernel function is likely
to be unwelcome in a number of situations.
<p>
Solving this problem is not necessarily easy.  Peter seems to favor
emulating the displaced instruction, but that would require
the implementation of a full instruction emulator in the kernel.  That code
would be large, architecture-specific, and error prone.  There was some
discussion of trying to run the instruction in kernel space, but doing that
securely appears to be a challenging task.  After an extended discussion,
the prevailing opinion seemed to be something like that <a
href="/Articles/370323/">expressed</a> by Pekka Enberg:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I guess we're looking at few megabytes of the address space for
	normal scenarios which doesn't seem too excessive...  I don't like
	the idea but if the performance benefits are real (are they?),
	maybe it's a worthwhile trade-off.
</div>
<p>
In the end, perhaps the kernel developers will hold their noses and merge
this approach, but chances are they'll need to talk about it for a while
yet first.
<p>
The uprobes code comes with an ftrace plugin which provides an interface to
user space for the placement and management of probes.  The problem here is
that the kernel developers have, for all practical purposes, decided that
there will be no more ftrace plugins added to the kernel.  New features are
supposed to go through the perf events subsystem instead, which is seen as
having a better-designed interface.  So the current ftrace plugin will
almost certainly have to be redone for perf events before this code can go
in.
<p>
The ftrace plugin also associates user-space probes with specific process
of interest.  Peter argues that it makes more sense to hook probes onto
executable files, then make the process association by way of the VMA
structure when the file is mapped.  Existing features in the kernel,
perhaps supplemented with a 
simple hook or two, would make it easy for uprobes to find processes
running code from a file and to deal with process comings and goings while
the probes are in place.  The uprobes developers have not said as much, as
of this writing, but it seems likely that the API could be reworked in
those terms.
<p>
Then, there is the nagging issue of the utrace layer, which has not yet
found its way into the mainline.  It has recently  been added to
linux-next, but there is <a href="/Articles/370521/">some discomfort</a>
with that and it's not clear if it will remain there or not.
<p>
All of this may seem like a lot of obstacles to the merging of this code, but
it also represents a step forward.  The road into the mainline has been
long for utrace; a final detour or two seems about par for the course.  The
existence of uprobes as an in-kernel user of utrace might help its cause,
once uprobes itself passes muster.
Assuming consensus on these issues can be reached, it should be possible to
make a last round of changes and be quite close to getting the code merged
- though it might be difficult to get this done for the 2.6.34 merge
window.  But, if things go well, we should have user-space probing not too
much later than that.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

We are not telling people to develop plugins for perf _instead_ of ftrace. The former doesn't supersedes the latter. They are complementary. ftrace is not deprecated. What is deprecated (in most cases) is the old ftrace plugin system (struct tracer) for new tracing code, altough it's still relevant for older tracers like function, mmiotrace, etc... Instead we recommend to use the ftrace trace event API because it is much more powerful, and it also creates events directly usable by perf.<br>

As I understand the article, a lot of the problems occur because more than one process might share the same page of object code (or 'text'), and so it's not possible to modify it without disrupting other processes that aren't being probed.  But why not just require that a process being probed must have its own, unshared copy of the code it executes?  On a modern system losing ten megabytes or so for a duplicate copy of your program and its shared libraries is not a big deal.  Or perhaps some kind of copy-on-write system could be used for these pages, so only the one page modified to insert the probe need be unshared between processes?<br>
<p>
I'm sure the kernel hackers have considered all this but the article doesn't mention why a simpler solution isn't possible.<br>

The problem with multithreaded programs is that if you disable breakpoint <br>

Suddenly I'm reading the project's name as UpRobes.  That might be even more descriptive.  :)<br>

Can anyone name an existing app that might break with the foreign memory area in its address space?  Based on this article, the complaints about XOL sound awfully obscure.<br>

Adding an emulator to the kernel just for this??  That would be an endless source of problems!<br>

Even the SSOL approach one needs to "emulate" / "fix" those of the <br>
instructions which use relative addressing, see Roland's old mail on the <br>
subject:<br>
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2007-q1/msg00571.html">http://sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2007-q1/msg00571.html</a><br>
<p>
And the instructions are of course architecture specific.<br>
<p>
The good thing is that if one puts breakpoints just on function entry &amp; <br>
exit points, those usually use fairly small set of instructions. See e.g. <br>
this user-space function tracing utility that uses SSOL with breakpoints:<br>
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://repository.maemo.org/pool/fremantle/free/f/functracer/">http://repository.maemo.org/pool/fremantle/free/f/functra...</a><br>
<p>
If breakpoints can be put anywhere, it's more of an issue.  Good question <br>
is how to test that emulation of all the required instructions for SSOL <br>
works fine...<br>

If I understand the suggestion that executable files should have probes attached rather then processes, then I'm against it.  What if I want to attach probes when a particular user (who has a use case that triggers problems) executes 'ls' or some other frequently executed program?  What happens when everyone else executes 'ls'?  I admit I really don't know how probes work, but it would worry me a lot if there wasn't some way to probe installed binaries without affecting all other users of that binary. Please tell me I shouldn't be worried.<br>

      The point of probes is that <tt>ls</tt> won't notice the extra few 
instructions. With 
some filtering at a privileged level, the prober won't see leaked 
information either.

      <p>Executables don't control their address space entirely, every library 
reserves some pages.</p>
<p>Could the extra address space be reserved once by a library everyone 
links to, the libc? Utrace would write the displaced instructions into that 
shared space, which the process has no control over. No VMA is introduced 
while the process is running.</p>
<p>Though that requires some coordination. It's more convenient to let the 
kernel do the reservation. But it can be done very early to not interfere 
with the process and its libraries.</p>

With his characteristically dry British humor, Matthew Garrett outlined the
current situation with x86 platform drivers at <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon">LinuxCon</a>. These
drivers are needed to handle various "extra" hardware devices, like special
keys, backlight control, extended battery information, fans, and so on.
There are a wide range of control mechanisms that hardware vendors use for
these devices, and, even when the controller hardware is the same, different
vendors will choose different mechanisms to talk to the devices. It is a
complicated situation that seems to require humor&mdash;and perhaps
alcohol&mdash;to master.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/456218/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/lcna-garrett-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=3 align="right"
alt="[Matthew Garrett]" width=120 height=150>
</a>

<p>
Garrett does a variety of things for Red Hat, including hardware support
and firmware interfaces (e.g. <a href="/Articles/454399/">for EFI</a>).
Mostly he does "<q>stuff that nobody else is really enthusiastic about
doing</q>", he said.  Platform drivers are "<q>bits of hardware
support code</q>" that are required to make all of the different pieces
of modern hardware function with Linux.  Today's hardware is not the PC of
old and it requires code to make things work, especially for mobile devices.
</p>

<p>
He started by looking at keys, those used to type with, but also those
that alter display brightness or turn hardware (e.g. wireless) on and off.
The "normal" way that keys have been handled is that a key press causes an
interrupt, the kernel reads a value from the keyboard controller, and the
keycode gets sent on to user space.  The same thing happens for a key up
event.  This is cutting edge technology from "<q>1843 or
something</q>", which is very difficult to get wrong, though some
manufacturers still manage to do so.  The first thing anyone writes when
creating a "<q>toy OS</q>" is the keyboard driver because it is so
straightforward. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to that simple picture, Garrett then described what goes on for
getting key event information on a Sony laptop.  The description was rather
baroque and spanned
three separate slides.  Essentially, the key causes an ACPI interrupt, which
requires the kernel to do a multi-step process executing "general purpose
event" (GPE) code in the ACPI firmware, and calling ACPI methods to
eventually get a key code that ends up being sent to user
space. "<q>This is called value add</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
Manufacturers are convinced that you don't want to manage WiFi the same way
on multiple devices.  Instead, they believe you want to use the "Lenovo
wireless manager" (for example) to configure the wireless device.
"<q>Some would call them insane</q>", and Garrett is definitely in
that camp.  The motivation seems to be an opportunity for the device maker
to splash their logo onto the screen when the manager program is run.  As
might be guessed, there is no 
documentation available because that would allow others to copy the
implementation, which obviates the supposed value add.
</p>

<p>
It is not just keyboards that require platform drivers, Garrett said.
Controlling radios, ambient light sensors ("<q>everyone wants the
brightness to change when someone walks behind them</q>"), extended
battery information (using identical battery controller chips, with the
interface implemented differently on each one), hard drive protection
(which always use the same accelerometer device), backlight control,
CPU temperature, fan control, LEDs (e.g. a "you have mail" indicator, that
is "<q>not really useful</q>" but is exposed "<q>for people who
don't have anything better to do with their lives</q>"), and more, all
need these drivers.
</p>

<h4>Multiple control mechanisms</h4>

<p>
There are half-a-dozen different interfaces that these drivers will use to
control the hardware, starting with plain ACPI calls.  That is generally
one of the easiest methods to use, because it is relatively straightforward
to read the ACPI tables and generate a driver from that information.
Events are sent to the driver, along with an event type, and some reverse
engineering is required to work out what the types are and what they do.
There are specific ACPI calls to get more information about the event as
well.  Garrett's example showed two <tt>acpi_evaluate_object()</tt> calls
for the AUSB ("attach USB") and BTPO ("Bluetooth power on") ACPI methods,
which is all that is needed to turn on Bluetooth for a Toshiba
device. "<q>Wonderful</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
A small micro-controller with closed-source firmware&mdash;the embedded
controller&mdash;is another means to control hardware.  Ideally, you
shouldn't have to touch the embedded controller because ACPI methods are
often provided to do so.  But, sometimes you need to access the registers of the
controller to fiddle with GPIO lines or read sensor data stored there.  The
problem is that these register locations can and do change between BIOS
versions.  While it is "<q>considered bad form to write a driver for a
specific BIOS version</q>", sometimes you have to do so.  It is a fairly
fragile interface, he said.
</p>

<p>
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a part of the Windows driver
model that Microsoft decided would be nice to glue into ACPI.  It has
methods that are based on globally unique IDs (GUIDs) corresponding to
events. A notify handler is registered for a GUID and it gets called when
that event happens.  The Managed Object Format (MOF) code that comes with a
given WMI implementation is supposed to be self-documenting, but there is a
problem: it is compressed inside the BIOS using a Microsoft proprietary
compression tool "<q>that we don't know how to decompress</q>". As an
example of WMI-based driver, Garrett showed a Dell laptop keyboard handling
driver that reports the exact same keycode that would have come from a
normal keyboard controller, but was routed through WMI instead, "<q>because this is the future</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
Drivers might also be required to make direct BIOS calls, which
necessitates the use of a real mode <tt>int</tt> instruction.  This is
"<q>amazingly fragile</q>" and incompatible with 64-bit processors.
Currently, the only time BIOS interrupts are invoked from user space are for
X servers and Garrett suggests that drivers should "<q>never do this</q>".
In fact, he went further than that: "<q>If you ever find hardware that
does this, tell me and I will send you money for new hardware</q>".  If
you decide to write code that implements this instead, he said that he would pay
someone else money to "<q>set fire to your house</q>".
</p>

<p>
System Management Mode (SMM) traps are yet another way to control hardware,
but there seems to be a lot of magic involved.  There are "<q>magic
addresses</q>" that refer to memory that is hidden from the kernel.  In
order to use them, a buffer is set up and the address is poked, at which
point the "<q>buffer contents magically change</q>". There have been
various problems with the SMM implementations from hardware vendors
including some HP hardware that would get confused if SMM was invoked from
anything other than CPU 0.  Garrett did not seem particularly enamored of
this technique, likening it to the business plan of the "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomes_%28South_Park%29">Underpants
Gnomes</a>". 
</p>

<p>
The last control mechanism Garrett mentioned is to use a native driver to
access the hardware resources directly.  Typically these drivers use ACPI
to identify that the hardware exists.  The hardware is accessed using the
port IO calls (i.e. <tt>inb()</tt>, <tt>outb()</tt>), and will use native
interrupts to signal events.  Various models of Apple hardware uses these
kinds of 
drivers, Garrett said.
</p>

<h4>Consistent interfaces</h4>

<p>
While there are many ways to access the hardware, kernel hackers want to
provide a consistent interface to these devices. We don't want "<q>to
have to install the Sony program to deal with WiFi</q>".  So, "hotkeys"
are sent through the input system, "<q>keys are keys</q>".  Backlight
control is done via the backlight class.  Radio control is handled with
rfkill, thermal and fan state via hwmon, and the LED control using the led
class. That way, users are insulated from the underlying details of how
their particular hardware implements these functions.
</p>

<p>
There are two areas that still have inconsistent interfaces, Garrett said.
The hard drive protection feature that is meant to park the disk heads when
an untoward acceleration is detected (e.g. the laptop is dropped) does not
have a consistent kernel interface.  Also, the <a href="/Articles/390634/">ambient light sensors are
lacking an interface</a>.  The latter has become something of a running joke
in the kernel community, he said, because Linus Torvalds thinks it should
be done one 
way, but the maintainer disagrees, so, as yet, there is no consistent interface.
</p>

<h4>How do I work this?</h4>

<p>
Garrett also had some suggestions on figuring out how new/unsupported
hardware is wired up. There is a fair amount of
reverse engineering that must be done, but the starting point is to use
<tt>acpidump</tt> and <tt>acpixtract</tt> utilities to find out what is in
the ACPI 
code in the hardware.  

<p>
If the device is WMI-based, <tt>wmidump</tt> may
also be useful.  Extracting the event GUIDs and registering a handler for
each will allow one to observe which ones fire for various external
events.  Then it is a matter of flipping switches to see what happens,
parsing the data that is provided with the event, and figuring how to do
something useful. This may require alcohol, he said.
</p>

<p>
For embedded controllers or direct hardware access, there are sysfs files
that can be useful.  The embedded controller can be accessed via
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io</tt> (at least for those who have debugfs mounted), or by using the <tt>ec_access</tt>
utility.  Once again, you need to hit buttons, throw various switches, and
listen for fan changes.  In addition, you should test that the register
offsets are stable for various machine and BIOS version combinations, he
said. You can find the IDs of devices to access them directly via
the <tt>/sys/bus/pnp/devices/*/id</tt> files, register as a PNP bus driver
for devices of interest, and then
"<q>work out how to drive the hardware</q>".
</p>

<p>
The overall picture that Garrett painted is one of needless complexity and
inconsistency that is promulgated by the hardware vendors.  But, it is
something that needs to be handled so that all of the "extras" baked into
today's hardware work reliably&mdash;consistently&mdash;with Linux.  While
it would be nice if all of these components were documented in ways that
Linux driver writers could use, that doesn't seem likely to change anytime
soon.  Until then, Garrett and the rest of the kernel community will be
wrestling with these devices so that we don't get locked into
manufacturer-specific control programs.

I don't know, but I suspect it's a lot easier for him to keep his sanity than it is for driver writers for Windows.<br>
<p>
With Linux you have a developer community that prefers well-written, comprehensive solutions to badly thought out, slapdash ones.  If it isn't working or is obviously a bad thing, it doesn't get included.  We have an open, accountable process to show those decisions and improve things.  If something needs to be fixed or improved in the kernel to make it easier for a class of drivers to work, then it usually is.<br>
<p>
With proprietary driver writers, everything is opaque.  You can't change anything outside your own little cubicle.  Decisions about how you write your code and when it's ready are arbitrary and driven mostly by time to market rather than quality.  Every once in a while Microsoft throws the old system in the trash, declares that .Net 17.5 is going to be the new way of doing things, it's half incompatible with what you've just written, and you have absolutely no say in this.  No wonder they spend all that time writing their own wifi handler software and come up with bulky, kludgy drivers.<br>
<p>
I'd be keeping him away from any hardware manufacturers and all sharp objects for the foreseeable future, though :-)<br>
<p>
Have fun,<br>

Well, actually kernel-level API in Windows is incredibly stable. It's possible to compile NT4-era drivers for Windows 7 with only minor modifications.<br>
<p>
And writing an input device driver is not hard - no community to slap your wrist if you try dirty hacks, no worry about code maintainability. Any half-trained code monkey can do it. And unfortunately many do, as witnessed by various crapware platform drivers.<br>

It's mostly only in tightly integrated systems. Some Sony and Acer all in one systems have similar features, but so far they've just reused the code from their laptops so everything pretty much just works.<br>
<p>
In most cases these features aren't things that prevent booting (people still expect most hardware to install unmodified versions of Windows), there'll just be some extra hardware that won't work.<br>

This may sound foolishly naive, but has anyone ever tried contacting the vendors to figure out a way for things to become more sane in the future? Granted, some of those things were done on purpose and some vendors (like Apple) won't want to help but I'm wondering about the rest  some of them are even selling their computers with Linux preinstalled.<br>

I believe Microsoft's WMI is just such an attempt.  Except, of course, for compressing the MOF code using a proprietary tool.  That part is just vendor lockout.<br>

Although that seems to have failed as well - the original WMI spec suggested <br>
Microsoft would standarise some of the WMI GUID's for common operations (GUID's are then mapped to a particular ACPI method, but the Linux WMI driver handles that conversion for you), which would have been useful here e.g. one standard GUID and arguments for querying a battery, a standard for wireless devices, etc.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, Microsoft have never done any such standardisation for WMI GUID calls, so it seems to have just become yet another way to put more vendor specific rubbish into the firmware in new and exciting ways.<br>

So is this a case of the PC platform becoming more like the ARM platform - i.e. every board is subtly different in inconsistent ways?<br>

All the standard PC functionality is still pretty consistent between machines, but in other areas it's pretty platform dependent, yes. The main difference between this and the ARM world is that the firmware usually provides an ACPI representation of the device, meaning you can build a generic kernel.<br>

Actually in the world of laptops.. this is a sign of moving away from the ARM model. Back in the scary days of 1997-2001, you could order a laptop from the same manufacturer once a month and never get the same hardware twice. Each one would have slightly different takes on stuff and you would have to guess at where they had stuck some part of the hardware this time. I am not a kernel developer but from a tech support side.. this is heaven with ACPI.<br>

<h1>Finding kernel problems automatically</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 1, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
In past years, this page has looked at the work done by the "Stanford
checker," which analyzes code in search of various types of programming
errors.  The checker has found a lot of problems over the years, with the
result that a lot of problems have been fixed before they had a chance to
bite users of production kernels.  
<p>
The only problem with the Stanford checker is that it is not free software;
it is, in fact, completely unavailable to the world as a whole.  Rather
than release the code, the checker group went off and formed <a
href="http://coverity.com">Coverity</a> to commercialize the checker
software (now called "SWAT" and touted, ominously, as being "patent
pending").  Developers at Coverity still occasionally post reports of
potential bugs found by SWAT, but, for the most part, their attention seems
focused on potential revenue opportunities.  
<p>
It is hard to complain about this outcome.  Before heading on this course,
the Coverity folks uncovered vast numbers of bugs, and all Linux users
benefited from that work.  They also demonstrated how valuable static code
testing tools can be.  The community, however, was left in the position of
having to actually write its own checker if it wanted one.  Fortunately,
this is the sort of thing the community can be good at.
<p>
A while back, none other than Linus Torvalds started work on his own tool,
which came to be called "sparse."  There has recently been a flurry of new
activity around sparse, so it seems like a good time to take a look.
<p>
sparse is normally obtained by cloning the BitKeeper repository at
<tt>bk://kernel.bkbits.net/torvalds/sparse</tt>.  For those who don't use
BK, a <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/">checked-out
version</a> is available (as a bunch of SCCS files) on kernel.org.  There
is a low-bandwidth <a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-sparse">sparse mailing
list</a> as well.
<p>
Essentially, sparse is a parsing and analysis library for the C language.
One could put a number of different backends onto it; for example, a
code-generation backend would turn it into a simple compiler.  For the
purposes of the kernel, however, the backend of interest is the analysis
code which looks for various types of errors.  The analyzer checks for
quite a few different types of errors.  Many of these (many sorts of type
mismatches, for example) are also found by the compiler, but other tests are
unique to sparse.
<p>
The core test done by sparse is still the check for improper use of
user-space pointers.  A quick look through the kernel will turn up liberal
use of a type attribute called <tt>__user</tt>; for example, the
<tt>read()</tt> method invoked from system calls is prototyped as:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
</pre>
<p>
When the kernel is being compiled, <tt>__user</tt> is defined as the empty
string, so <tt>gcc</tt> doesn't see it at all.  When sparse is being used,
instead, it marks the pointer as (1)&nbsp;being in a separate address
space, and (2)&nbsp;not being legal to dereference.  sparse will use those
flags to catch any mixing of user- and kernel-space pointers, and any
attempt to directly dereference user-space pointers.  
<p>
These checks have turned up a surprising number of errors.  The kernel
normally sets up the virtual address space in such a way that direct
dereferencing of user-space pointers actually works - most of the time.
Using user-space addresses in this way will fail, however, if the user page
is not actually resident in memory at the time.  More importantly, perhaps,
this sort of direct dereferencing bypasses the normal access controls;
every such error could, thus, become a security hole.
<p>
Catching such mistakes automatically seems like a good idea.  It does
require, however, that every variable holding a user-space pointer be
marked with the <tt>__user</tt> attribute.  Since much of the kernel
(including every device driver) deals 
with user-space pointers, this is not a trivial job.  This job is
proceeding, however; several dozen patches adding <tt>__user</tt>
annotations (and fixing problems found on the way) have been merged for
2.6.7. 
<p>
Other checks performed include finding constants which are overly long for
their target type, mistakes in embedded assembly language code, empty
<tt>switch</tt> statements, assignments in conditionals, and so on.  Its
output is rather noisy still, but one assumes that will improve over time.  
If you have sparse installed, running it on the kernel is simply a matter
of adding "<tt>C=1</tt>" to the <tt>make</tt> command.  External modules
can also be checked in this way.
<p>
sparse is still clearly far behind the Stanford checker in terms of the
variety of errors it can find.  Unlike the checker, however, sparse is free
software.  The core parsing infrastructure is in place, so the addition of
new checks should be relatively straightforward.  All that's needed is the
application of a bunch of developer time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Why would you want a version of C with strong-typing? It wouldn't be C anymore; it would probably be no easier to port code from C to new-C than it would to port it to Ada or some other real language with strong typing. If you want Ada, or Java, or Modula-3, or even C++, you know where to find them.

      Except that, with a few preprocessor defines to remove the strong-C keywords, you could compile strong-C on a weak-C compiler.  The kernel source code could even be a mix of strong and weak C as it transitions to strong-C over the period of a few years.  There are very real benefits to simply extending an existing language -- witness C++.

      Yes, witness C++. Part of C++'s problem is that it's an incredible pain to parse correctly (notice that GCC ended up completely rewritting the C++ parser to properly support standard C++.) Part of the reason is that C++ was designed based on the already complex C syntax.<p>Another problem with C++ is that C--especially real world C, but even standard C--and C++ aren't completely compatible either way. Stroustroup had to make a few minor tweaks that lost compatibility to make C++ work right. A strong-C is more than likely going to have a few edge cases where things don't work exactly the same.<p>To use a few preprocessor defines to remove the strong-C is going to hamstring your efforts; the differences are just not going to be that minimal, and that tightly limits your syntax. What you're asking for is basically the system described in the article, not a new language.<br>

      Yes... It is called MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) C and it amounts to many rules asking you to do this and not do that. MISRA C compliance can be checked using static analyzers. For example, rule 33 says that the right hand operand of &amp;&amp; or || shall not contain side effects.<p>Some of the MISRA rules, however, may not be compatible with systems programming.

... that the Stanford Checker was built around gcc (xgcc) and thus should be obligated by the GPL if they ever distribute it.
</p><p>
So, if Coverity is selling (distributing) a derivative of this as a product ...
</p><p>
Now, it's possible that they took *their* code and ported it to some other compiler environment; or it's possible they are billing this as a service and not as a product.
</p><p>
However, it doesn't seem like they are acting in the spirit of free software in either case.
<p></p>
I can also complain since I sent them a number of messages politely asking for information about the project and it's progress and inquiring about the the possibility having anyone from their team speak at a local technical group (<a href="http://www.baylisa.org/">BayLISA</a>) and never received the courtesy of a response --- not even a curt note to the effect that they are far to busy and important to speak to the likes of us sysadmins.

      I sent a couple of notes, and got replies saying that they'd release it when they'd tidied the code up. Doesn't look like that's going to happen.<p>Regarding the other bit - they'll port the checker code to whichever compiler you want. If it's gcc, then I can't see that they have any way of stopping you from redistributing it afterwards - but you'd have to have enough money to pay for the port.

           </div>
Like user space, the kernel accesses memory through page tables; as a
result, when kernel code needs to access memory-mapped I/O devices, it must
first set up an appropriate kernel page-table mapping.  The in-kernel tool
for that job has long been <tt>ioremap()</tt>, which has a number of
variants.  It turns out that some of those variants are not always the
right tool for the job, leading to a certain amount of workaround code in
the kernel.  That situation may change, though, as part of a move away from
<tt>ioremap()</tt> for the problematic cases.
<p>
A successful call to <tt>ioremap()</tt> returns a kernel virtual address
corresponding to start of the requested physical address range.  This address is not
normally meant to be dereferenced directly, though, for a number of (often
architecture-specific) reasons.  Instead, accessor functions like
<tt>readb()</tt> or <tt>iowrite32()</tt> should be used.  To enforce this
rule, the return address from <tt>ioremap()</tt> is annotated with the
<tt>__iomem</tt> marker; that will cause the <tt>sparse</tt> checker to
complain about accesses that do not use the proper functions.
<p>
There is also the little matter of caching.  The CPU normally caches data
from memory, but that is a bad idea when I/O is involved for a number of
reasons.  Attempts to read a full cache line from I/O memory can have no
end of unexpected side effects, and delaying writes to I/O memory can
change the way the device operates.  I/O memory should normally function as
a direct control channel to the device; to that end, <tt>ioremap()</tt>
disables caching on device memory — on the x86 architecture, at least.
<p>
In truth, the caching status of a memory range obtained from
<tt>ioremap()</tt> is not fully defined.  As a general rule, uncached is
the default, but there is still an <tt>ioremap_nocache()</tt> that can be
called by code that wants to be absolutely sure that there will be no
cache between it and its device memory.
<p>
In some cases, though, I/O memory is just memory; the video memory used by
a graphics adapter is a classic example.  With this kind of memory, direct
pointer references can be expected to work and caching in the CPU
may be acceptable; indeed, it may be required to get reasonable
performance.  For such cases, there is an <tt>ioremap_cache()</tt> that
creates a cached mapping if possible.  Most architectures also have a
couple of variants that allow caching of reads but limit caching of
writes.  In particular, <tt>ioremap_wc()</tt> allows combining of write
operations and <tt>ioremap_wt()</tt> causes
writes to go directly to device memory.  With these variants, driver
writers can obtain the kind of mapping they need for a specific piece of
device memory.
<p>
Dan Williams recently ran into a couple of problems with this family of
functions, though.  One is that they all return pointers with the
<tt>__iomem</tt> annotation.  A driver that is mapping I/O memory with
caching enabled almost certainly will treat the resulting address range as
if it were ordinary memory — including directly dereferencing pointers into
that range.  To do so, they must either cast away the <tt>__iomem</tt>
annotation or simply ignore it.  In the former case, the code is noisier
than it would otherwise be; in the latter case, anybody running
<tt>sparse</tt> on the code will have to ignore the resulting warnings.
<p>
Beyond that, many architectures do not support all of the various caching
modes, so the architecture-specific header files are full of lines like:
<p>
<pre>
    #define ioremap_wt ioremap_nocache
</pre>
<p>
The result is that callers of functions like <tt>ioremap_wt()</tt> may
silently fail to get the writethrough caching that they are asking for.
<p>
Dan's answer to both problems is <a href="/Articles/652964/">a patch
set</a> adding a new function for the mapping of device memory that behaves
like memory:
<p>
<pre>
    void *memremap(resource_size_t offset, size_t size, unsigned long flags);
</pre>
<p>
This function will (on success) return an address for a mapping to the
device memory found at the given physical <tt>offset</tt> and of the given
<tt>size</tt> (in bytes).  The <tt>flags</tt> argument can be either
<tt>MEMREMAP_WB</tt> for full writeback caching or <tt>MEMREMAP_WT</tt> for
writethrough caching.  The returned address does not have the
<tt>__iomem</tt> annotation.  If the requested caching behavior cannot be
provided, <tt>memremap()</tt> will return <tt>NULL</tt> rather than fall
back to a different type of caching.
<p>
The patch set converts most in-kernel code over to the new interface.
<p>
This work is in its third revision as of this writing, and the (few)
review comments made have been addressed.  It clarifies the driver API,
clearly separating two different use cases for the mapping of device
memory, and it should result in less <tt>sparse</tt> warning noise.  There
is not much to dislike at this point, so there shouldn't be much keeping it
out of the 4.3 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
At <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x">SCALE</a>
this year Dan Schatzberg and Tejun Heo,
both from Meta, gave back-to-back talks about some
of the performance-engineering work that they do there. Schatzberg presented on
the <a href="/Articles/922405">extensible BPF scheduler</a>, which has been
discussed extensively on the kernel mailing list.
Heo presented on IOCost — a control group (cgroup) I/O controller
optimized for solid-state disks (SSDs) — and the benchmark suite that is necessary to
make it work well on different models of disk.
</p>

<h4>Scheduling with BPF</h4>

<p>
For many years, Linux used the <a href="/Articles/230574">
Completely Fair Scheduler</a> (CFS) to decide which tasks
should run on which CPUs at any given time. In kernel version 6.6,
the default scheduler
changed to the <a href="/Articles/925371">Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline
First</a> (EEVDF) scheduler.
Schatzberg presented what is, in his view, a serious problem with both of
these schedulers: iteratively
improving the design is difficult, because trying out a new scheduler policy
requires rebuilding the kernel and rebooting.
He presented the BPF-based scheduler as a way to work around this problem
— a proposal that has
previously been the subject of much debate in the kernel community.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/967162">

</a>

<p>
The core idea of a scheduler is simple — "the scheduler's job is just sharing
the core" — but implementing a performant scheduler can make things "very
complicated very quickly". Schatzberg called out the increasing prevalence of
heterogeneous computing systems as a particular source of complexity.
There are several attributes of a good scheduler that
people might care about, such as fairness, optimization, low overhead, and
general applicability. Finding a scheduling policy that is best for a given
workload therefore needs to involve a lot of performance measurements and
experimentation. Once a scheduling policy has been found, though, using it
requires maintaining a scheduler out-of-tree currently. Schatzberg's employer
has a policy of trying to
upstream as many kernel changes as possible, to reduce its maintenance burden
and make use of recent kernels. Upstreaming patches for a constantly changing
workload-specific scheduler would be difficult.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, Schatzberg and others have been working on an
extensible scheduler (<tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>)
"allowing you to implement scheduling policies [...] as BPF
programs at runtime". Experimenting with a scheduling policy using <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>
involves writing a BPF program, compiling it, and loading it into the running
kernel. When changing to a new scheduler, users "don't even need to stop the running
workload", which makes experimentation much faster.
</p>

<p>
Schatzberg spent some time explaining the work that has gone into making this
kind of experimentation safe.
Since the scheduler is written in BPF, the BPF verifier ensures it cannot
crash or break the running kernel. Furthermore, there is a kernel watchdog in
<tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> that will
automatically kick a BPF scheduler out if it has failed to
schedule a task for a configurable amount of time. So even a broken BPF
scheduler that refuses to schedule anything won't permanently hang a machine.
</p>

<h4>Writing a scheduler</h4>

<p>
Schatzberg then gave an explanation of how to actually write a scheduler using
<tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>. The general idea is that the BPF program implements an
<a href="/Articles/811631">operations structure</a> full of
callbacks that the kernel will call during scheduling.
The structure that BPF sets up with these callbacks also contains
various configuration options, such as the name of the scheduler and the desired
watchdog timeout. Three callbacks contain the most vital parts of the
scheduler:
</p>

<pre>
    s32 (*select_cpu)(struct task_struct *p, s32 prev_cpu, u64 wake_flags);

    void (*enqueue)(struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags);

    void (*dispatch)(s32 cpu, struct task_struct *prev);
</pre>

<p>
All three of these have default implementations, but "any sufficiently
complicated scheduler will probably implement these three".
</p>

<p>
To actually implement these callbacks, "you need to understand dispatch queues",
which are data structures that contain a list of runnable tasks. By
default, each CPU has its own dispatch queue that it automatically takes tasks
from, but the scheduler can create as many auxiliary dispatch queues as it
needs. <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> handles all the required locking around performing operations
on these queues.
</p>

<p>
With that understanding in mind, Schatzberg showed the code to make a simple
global first-in first-out scheduler. This is a naive scheduling policy, but
Schatzberg noted: "This actually outperforms CFS for some of our production
workflows" because getting a task onto an idle core as quickly as possible has
some benefits.
The example scheduler enqueues tasks by adding them to a global dispatch queue,
and then dispatches tasks from that queue when a CPU runs out of work on its own
queue.
</p>

<pre>
    s32 BPF_STRUCT_OPS_SLEEPABLE(mysched_init)
    {
      scx_bpf_create_dsq(/* queue id = */ 0, -1);
    }
</pre>

<p>
<tt>mysched_init()</tt> creates the global dispatch queue that the scheduler uses.
</p>

<pre>
    void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(mysched_enqueue, struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags)
    {
      scx_bpf_dispatch(p, /* queue id = */ 0, SCX_SLICE_DFL, enq_flags);
    }
</pre>

<p>
<tt>mysched_enqueue()</tt> accepts a task from the kernel, and places it
directly on the end of the global dispatch queue.
</p>

<pre>
    void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(mysched_dispatch, s32 cpu, struct task_struct *prev)
    {
      scx_bpf_consume(/* queue id = */ 0);
    }
</pre>

<p>
<tt>mysched_dispatch()</tt> runs when a CPU becomes idle and needs another task.
It takes the task from the front of the global dispatch queue and immediately
starts it running.
</p>

<p>
Schatzberg noted that the
<a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/main/scheds/c/scx_simple.bpf.c">
full implementation</a> of the scheduler was slightly
longer because it needs to handle tasks such as waking up a CPU that has gone to
sleep when there's more work, but emphasized that a complete scheduler could be
written in 150 lines, including comments.
</p>

<p>
He then gave an example of a slightly less naive scheduler that keeps a
separate queue per L3 cache. He pointed out that even this simple
optimization raises a lot of questions — when should cores steal work from other
L3 caches? When should work be proactively load-balanced across the different
queues? Schatzberg said that the real answer is that it depends on the workload,
and that developers should experiment using <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>. "The whole idea is that
<tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> lets us experiment with these kinds of policies really quickly".
</p>

<p>
He finished off the talk by giving some examples of various schedulers suited to
different purposes.
Those schedulers, as well as various support tools to make
writing BPF-based schedulers easier, are available
<a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/tree/main">
on GitHub</a>.
For the future, he sees the top priority as getting <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>
upstreamed into the kernel — a task that may be difficult since
scheduler maintainer Peter Zijlstra <a href="/Articles/939332/">dislikes</a>
the patch series. Schatzberg thought that <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> could be valuable
to users:
"We want to build a community around it". He said
that there were many features that could be added to make <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> more
usable, but that they were mostly BPF features, and not <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> features per
se.
</p>

<h4>IOCost</h4>

<p>
After Schatzberg's talk, Heo described his own performance work,
this time in the area of cgroup I/O controllers.
<a href="/Articles/603762">
Cgroups</a> are hierarchical groupings of processes that can have resource limits
attached to different nodes in the hierarchy. Heo compared them to a filesystem
that contains the processes running on a system.
Cgroup controllers have the job of allocating
resources to processes within a cgroup, and reacting if they exceed their
limits. There are existing cgroup controllers for memory usage, CPU usage,
process creation,
block device I/O, and more.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/967159">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/Tejun_Heo-fuzz.png"

  float: right;"
height=286 width=270
alt="[Tejun Heo]" title="Tejun Heo"
>
</a>

<p>
Heo has been working on a controller for block device I/O called
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/block/blk-iocost.c">
IOCost</a>. The controller
is intended to distribute solid-state disk
block operations to different cgroups,
ensuring that applications cannot hog the disk's bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
He opened by describing why writing an I/O controller is more challenging than
writing a controller for memory or CPU. Firstly, the metrics usually used to
measure performance of block devices "are not great". For example, specifying
the budget of an application in bytes per second or I/O requests per second can
result in a limit that is
simultaneously too low and too high, because the actual number of bytes per
second that a solid-state disk (SSD)
can service varies wildly based on several factors. "That
makes single-metric based control, based on these numbers, really challenging".
</p>

<p>
More problematically, SSDs can be so fast that if the overhead from the cgroup
controller is too high, it can noticeably impact the performance of the
application. This isn't the case for rotating drives, where it is frequently worth
sacrificing some CPU time to optimize disk reads, because the disk latency is
so high. That means that existing I/O controllers designed for rotating disks often
perform poorly on SSDs.
</p>

<p>
And finally, block devices are a shared resource that the entire system needs to
use, which makes it easy to accidentally create priority inversions. For
example, writing to a journaling filesystem requires writing to a shared journal
for the whole filesystem. If the I/O controller delays a
low-priority process's write to the journal, all of the high-priority processes
that also need to write to the journal are stuck waiting as well. Priority
inversion isn't a
problem unique to block devices, but it is especially noticeable there
since every process on the system contends for the same resource.
</p>

<p>
IOCost addresses these challenges in a number of ways, starting by
measuring the expense of block operations using "a fairly simple
linear model" that is "better than any single metric". It also doesn't try to
restrict applications to a numeric limit. Heo pointed out that if you ask an
application developer how many I/O operations per second or MB per second
they need, "you don't get a good
answer. Nobody really knows." So instead, IOCost imposes relative limits —
allowing the administrator to say how much I/O each cgroup should receive
proportionally.
</p>

<p>
To make access decisions quickly enough to not impede SSD performance, IOCost
separates its logic into two parts: a planning path that runs every few
milliseconds, and an execution path that runs on every request. The planning
path handles all of the complex calculations, and then pushes the configuration to
the execution path, so that the execution path doesn't need to do much to
determine how a request should be handled. This helps keep the latency overhead
of the controller low.
</p>

<p>
Finally, IOCost integrates with the filesystem and memory-management facilities
in the kernel to avoid priority inversions. Throttled I/O requests that are
expected to cause priority inversions are run right away, but then charged to
the process that exceeded its limits. Heo summarized this approach as "do
first, pay later"
</p>

<p>
IOCost works well in practice for the use-case for which it was designed.
Heo showed the results of some internal tests which demonstrated
that IOCost has negligible latency overhead, and perfectly maintains the
configured ratio of I/O between two benchmark workloads. IOCost "is fully
deployed at Meta, on almost all our machines". He summarized this section with a
slide that said "IOCost works well as long as it[']s configured well".
</p>

<p>
But that statement conceals a lot of complexity, because it is not easy to
configure IOCost well. The linear cost-model that IOCost uses
to estimate how expensive a particular I/O request is requires tuning for each
model of SSD, because they all behave differently. To solve this problem, Heo
and his collaborators created
<a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/resctl-demo?tab=readme-ov-file#resctl-bench">
<tt>resctl-bench</tt></a>: a scenario-based benchmarking tool that observes
the end-to-end behavior of an SSD. It is part of the larger resctl-demo project,
which includes resources for various different types of resource control on
Linux. <tt>resctl-bench</tt> imitates a workload "similar to
what we see in the production environment". Heo also said that it was a major
improvement on other benchmarks because: "The bar is fairly low here. We don't
have a bar, because nothing works well".
</p>

<p>
<tt>resctl-bench</tt> is not easy to set up and run, so Heo also made an installable
Linux image that runs the benchmark and automatically generates a report (and
configurations for IOCost) based on the result. He noted that "I didn't want to
do a live demo, because it takes eight hours", but he did show a series of slides
explaining how to use the tool to characterize an SSD and then submit the
measurements to
<a href="https://github.com/iocost-benchmark/iocost-benchmarks">
the database</a> where he is collecting statistics on different SSD
models. He called for interested people to run the benchmark on their own
systems, because more data points can make IOCost more performant for everyone.
</p>

<p>
One audience member asked whether it was viable to have IOCost learn the
parameters it needs on the fly. Heo explained that it wasn't, because of how
difficult it is to get the needed feedback from an SSD under normal operation.
"It would be really great if you could", he remarked.
Another audience member asked whether
the benchmark takes into account SSD over-provisioning — the practice of putting
more storage into an SSD than its stated capacity, so that the firmware of the disk has
spare sectors to replace failing sectors with.
Benchmarks that only write a disk's claimed capacity often provide inaccurate
results about long-term performance for over-provisioned disks.
Heo affirmed that <tt>resctl-bench</tt> does take overprovisioning into account,
and that it ends up writing many
times the disk's claimed capacity in the course of the benchmark.
</p>

<p>
I asked about the plans for IOCost; Heo said "in our
fleet, it seems to work well", and that he wanted to see more people using it.
He sees IOCost as fairly complete, with the notable exception of how painful it
is to configure. He hopes to improve that over time.
</p>

<p>
IOCost is already part of the kernel, and can be configured by following
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#io">
the documentation</a>. The <tt>resctl-bench</tt>
<a href="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/resctl-demo-website/docs/">
documentation</a> explains how to try the benchmark on one's own devices.

Only somewhat related: I wonder if md's system for “RAID resync/check uses spare I/O only, will not disturb your normal I/O” (modulo speed_limit_max/min) has ever worked for anyone. If anyone has a neat trick there (that would possibly use some sort of real I/O scheduler?), I'd love to hear about it!<br>

Having recently been through this again, my answer is "still nope"<br>
<p>
(RAID6 resync/check across a total of 5 drives rendered the particular 28c/56t system quite laggy even for stuff that didn't need disk I/O..)<br>

IOCost -- I'm glad someone's tested and shown there's value to the intuition that's rattled round my head: you can optimise scheduling by mapping out the device's characteristic capacities and latencies.<br>
<p>
I'm glad it's proving the ground for this with to be fertile.<br>

Any filesystem designed for use with rotating media must pay careful
attention to the layout of files on the disk.  If a file's blocks can be
placed sequentially on the device, they can be read or written as a unit,
without the need for performance-destroying head seeks in the middle.  Even
the most careful filesystem will sometimes fail to lay out files in a
minimal number of contiguous extents, though.  If a file grows, for
example, and the blocks just past the previous end are not available, the
filesystem has no choice other than placing the new blocks somewhere else.
Depending on how full the filesystem is, those blocks could end up far away
indeed.  This sort of fragmentation can result in filesystems slowing down
over time.
<p>
Fragmentation problems can be fixed up after the fact.  The most obvious
way to defragment a disk is to make a new filesystem on it; after all,
empty filesystems tend not to have fragmentation problems.  But the new
filesystem will have less fragmentation even after its old contents have
been restored onto it.  When the ultimate size of every file is known in
advance, it's relatively easy to make good layout decisions.  Knowing this,
system administrators have used backup-and-restore cycles as a way of
cleaning up overly fragmented disks for many years.
<p>
There is, of course, a problem with this approach which goes beyond the
risk of discovering that one's backup is not quite as good as one had
thought.  The downtime associated with rewriting a disk can be unwelcome to
users; a filesystem which is down responds even more slowly than a
filesystem with fragmentation problems.  So it would be nice to have a way
to defragment a filesystem while keeping it online and available.  This
online defragmentation capability has been on the ext4 "planned features"
list for a long time; it is, at this point, about the only planned feature
which has not yet been merged into the mainline.
<p>
Some attempts at online defragmentation have been made in the past, but
they have not, yet, gotten through review.  Now Akira Fujita has come
forward with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/317584/">a new ext4 online
defragmentation patch</a> which, by virtue of a different view of the
problem, might just make it into the mainline.  Previous attempts exposed
an interface whereby a user-space application could ask the filesystem to
defragment a specific file by allocating new (contiguous) blocks to it.
That turned out to be a bit too much work to put into the kernel; so, with
this patch, Akira has created an interface which moves a bit more of the
work into user space.
<p>

In the new scheme, a user-space defragmentation daemon will pick a file
which, in its opinion, is too spread out on the disk.  The daemon will then
set about creating a new, less-fragmented file to replace it.  That is done
by creating a new, temporary file on the same filesystem, then unlinking it
(while holding the file descriptor open).  Calls to <tt>fallocate()</tt>
can then be used to add the requisite number of blocks to the new file.
Once the new file is up to the correct size, the daemon can use the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260795/"><tt>FS_IOC_FIEMAP</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt></a> to query the number of extents (fragments) it contains.  If the
new file is not an improvement over the old one, the daemon should just
close it and give up; the filesystem simply does not have enough contiguous
storage available.
<p>

The daemon could, at this point, simply copy the old file into the new one,
then put the newly defragmented version in the place of the old one.  The
problems with that approach include performance (all that data must be
copied through user space) and robustness.  If some other process changes
the file while the copy is happening, the new file may lose those changes.
Indeed, if some process has the old file open, it may never notice that the
replacement has happened.  So something smarter is needed.
<p>
Akira's patch addresses these problems with the creation of a new, magic
<tt>ioctl()</tt> call for ext4.  The defragmentation application must fill
out a structure like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct move_extent {
	int org_fd;		/* original file descriptor */
	int dest_fd;		/* destination file descriptor */
	ext4_lblk_t start;	/* logical offset of org_fd and dest_fd*/
	ext4_lblk_t len;	/* exchange block length */
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure, when passed to the new <tt>EXT4_IOC_DEFRAG</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt>, expresses a request to the kernel to move <tt>len</tt>
blocks from the original file to the new one, starting at <tt>start</tt>.
Essentially, it copies an extent's worth of data into the (fully allocated,
nicely contiguous) space in the new file, then performs a magic block
swap.  The contiguous blocks from the new file are patched into the old
file, while the fragmented blocks are, instead, put into the new file.
Once the entire file has been treated in this way, the file will have been
defragmented without having been visibly moved.
<p>
The final step is to delete the "new" file, which now contains the "old"
file's blocks.  Since the file had been unlinked, that will cause the
filesystem to recover the old blocks and the task will be complete.  For
the curious, Akira has posted <a href="/Articles/317803/">the source for a
user-space defragmentation tool</a> which shows how this interface can be
used. 
<p>
There have not been a whole lot of objections to the new code.  Chris Mason
did <a href="/Articles/317801/">point out</a> that the system will do
unfortunate things if the layout of a swap file changes.  He has clearly
thought about the problem - to an extent:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Btrfs is currently getting around this by dropping bmap support, so
	swapfiles on btrfs won't work at all.  A real long term solution is
	required&nbsp;;)
</div>
<p>
Beyond that, there are some minor issues, such as the definition of the ABI
in terms of types like <tt>int</tt> instead of architecture-independent
types.  Requests for separate source and destination block numbers have
been made; that feature would help developers working on hierarchical
storage systems.  The ability to guide the allocation of blocks would be
useful in situations where performance can be improved by grouping related
files together on the disk.
<p>
There could also be value in finding a way to move much of this
functionality into the VFS layer where it could be used with other
filesystems as well; that could prove to be a difficult task, though, and
ext4 maintainer Ted Ts'o <a href="/Articles/317911/">has little
desire</a> to take on that job.
<p>
Those little issues notwithstanding, it does appear that the ext4 filesystem
may be closer to getting the much-requested online defragmentation feature.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      While it's obviously possible, I've never had any serious problem with the swap file getting extremely fragmented.  It would be fine by me if online defragmentation of the swap file wasn't allowed.  Instead of building complicated mechanisms for file systems to support that, and requiring file systems to use it, a relatively simple piece of kernel code could check whether the file in question was an active swap file, and deny the request from user space.
<p>
If you really need to do it, the user space utility could create a replacement swap file, defragment it (if necessary), enable swapping on the new file, then disable swapping on the old file and delete it.  That's not significantly worse than the way the defragmentation patch works with regard to normal (non-swap) files.  The user-space program could determine whether the file in question is a swap file, and deal with it appropriately.

This in fact, also holds true for FAT and NTFS. (It seems possible to get it moved by removing the system attrib from it, but who knows what side effects this has on a live swap...)<br>

The algorithm for creating a new file, preallocating and comparing<br>
extents before doing any data movement is pretty much the same as what<br>
xfs_fsr does. however, they differ in teh method of data exchange<br>
algorithms.<br>
<p>
xfs_fsr does all the data movement via direct IO in userspace<br>
(i.e. scales extremely well). It swaps the extents atomically<br>
if the inode has not changed between the start of the data copy<br>
and the completion of it. Hence you can't defragment active files.<br>
<p>
This was considered a fundamental blocker for ext4 even though<br>
most active files never need defragmentation (think shared<br>
libraries). Hence the ext4 patchset implements data movement inside<br>
ext4 itself and so the kernel defrag code is much, much more complex<br>
than the XFS swap extents ioctl. Userspace complexity is about the<br>
same, but different APIs were required for ext4 to do it's "a bit at<br>
a time" algorithm....<br>

on flash disks the access time differences are smaller, but there are still advantages to sequential reads/writes compared to random ones.<br>
<p>
in addition, flash devices actually write in blocks much larger than the typical block size (block sizes are in the 1-4K range, eraseblocks are in the 128K to multi-meg range).<br>
<p>
a 'worst case' scenario with low-end current systems would be overwriting an existing file on a filesystem with 1k blocks and 256K eraseblocks. if you have a 1M file it could be 4 writes to the flash, or 1000 writes to the flash.<br>
<p>
normally files don't get this fragmented, so you won't see that worst-case in real life, but the grouping can really matter.<br>
<p>
another place where you could see a huge difference is on RAID 5/6 arrays. if your system checks parity on reads, a read of one block requires reading the entire stripe and verifying the parity data. if all your data is on that stripe you have it all, if not you have to repeat the process<br>
<p>
for writes it can be even more drastic. to modify an existing stripe you need to read the existing block from the disk being changed and the parity disk(s), then calculate the changes to the parity and write the changes out. If you know that you are overwriting the entire stripe there is no need to read any old data first, just calculate the new parity and do the write. If you could do this (no system does this today), then streaming/large file writes to raid5/6 would be just about as fast as to raid0 (some additional cpu time, and the IO bandwidth of the parity disks, but unless the system is saturated these will not matter)<br>

If I understand correctly, there is also one other reason, not mentioned clearly in the article, why the defragmentation daemon needs some support from the kernel space.<br>
The "put the newly defragmented version in the place of the old one" part must be done by updating the inode of the original or you would end up having to hunt and update all the directory entries pointing to the file.<br>

You'd also break everything that had the file open for writing if you left <br>
it pointing at a deleted file.<br>

This doesn't seem to help consolidate free space, which I'd have thought is a big part of limiting future fragmentation, and would also help make it easier to defragment existing large files.<br>

And when the kernel is defragmented and LILO loads some other random blocks?<br>

It doesn't matter.<br>
<p>
LILO does not support ext4, if I'm not mistaken. Not even GRUB supports it in stable releasses. The GRUB2 development-version however does, but I understand it, it's not in any distribution. Their might be distributions that backported the ext4 support from GRUB2 to GRUB, I've not checked it.<br>

What's with all this donor inode stuff?<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be much simpler to have 3 ioctls that<br>
<p>
* query a file/inode for a block/extent mapping to find out where its data is and how badly it's fragmented<br>
* atomically relocate any extent to anywhere on disk<br>
* mark a given section of the disk as not open for allocation<br>
<p>
These three ioctl's together would seem to be more useful<br>
<p>
The first one would accept an inode or an fd and return a listing of what extents are where.  Useful for analyzing a file for fragmentation and/or planning an optimal relocation strategy.<br>
<p>
The second one would do most of the grunt work.  It would accept an inode or fd, a file offset, an extent size, and a disk offset, and use that to put the given chunk of said file on the disk at the directed spot.  Of course we'd sanity check stuff to prevent overwriting of other files in use and whatnot, and maybe make it interruptible so that impatient admins don't have to panic, and wayward defrags don't lock up the system.  We might even return a size_t indicating how much of the block in question was relocated (much like the read and write system calls)<br>
<p>
The third one would prevent backfill into a part of the disk we're trying to clean up.  This would keep normal disk allocation activity from polluting a zone we're trying to use to reassemble a file.  Naturally this is easily abused so it might be best to restrict this to root, and of course it would probably only work on a per mount basis, and perhaps even restricting the "red zone" to one segment or so that occupies no more than half of the file system.<br>
<p>
These three would allow fine tuned defragmentation and even allow norton style heuristics whereby active files are gapped for room to grow.  Giving the userspace utility using these ioctls full control over them could optimize how well we defrag the filesystem.<br>
<p>
The "donor inode" method doesn't seem quite as flexible as defragmentation could be.<br>
<p>
Heck, the previous "defrag trifecta" could probably even be extended to work with filesystems in general such as ext3, btrfs, fat32, and others.<br>

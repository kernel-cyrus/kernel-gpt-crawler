<h1>Python bindings added for libseccomp 2.2.0</h1>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>March 4, 2015</br>

<p>
The secure computing (seccomp) facility was added to Linux some <a href="/Articles/120647/">ten years
ago</a> as a way to restrict programs so that they can only make a 
small subset of system calls.  It is a way to sandbox processes but, over the
years, it was found to be <i>too</i> restrictive. Thus, after a few false
starts, a new <a href="/Articles/475043/">seccomp mode</a> that used the
kernel's Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation to provide a way to more
flexibly sandbox processes came about in 2012.  To help application writers
use the facility, Paul Moore <a href="/Articles/494252/">created
libseccomp</a>, and he has just <a href="/Articles/633155/">released</a>
version 2.2.0 of the library.
</p>

<p>
This is the first release of libseccomp for more than a year, with a 2.1.1
minor release 
in October&nbsp;2013 (after 2.1.0 in June&nbsp;2013).  One of the headline
features for 2.2.0 is the addition of Python bindings, which have been
around for a while but have not been part of a release until now.  Other
big changes for this release include a switch to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system">Autotools</a>, support
for the ARM 64-bit architecture, as well as support for several flavors of the
MIPS architecture (mips, mips64, and mips64n32). 
</p>

<p>
The newer seccomp mode (known as seccomp filters or seccomp mode 2) allows
developers to specify which 
system calls are allowed to be made and to restrict the arguments that can
be passed to those system calls.  In order to do that, the kernel requires
a program 
written using the <a href="/Articles/599755/">BPF language</a>, which was
originally targeted at network filtering, though it has grown well beyond that.  Libseccomp is meant
to provide a higher-level interface to that functionality—from C and, now,
Python.

<p>
If you have a program that is handling untrusted user input—HTTP traffic
or image formats, say—you might want to restrict the kinds of operations
that program can perform.  For example, there might just be a handful of
operations that should be allowed to the program, so that if it were
compromised by unexpected input, there is little an attacker can actually
do.  On the other hand, though, the program might require a bit more than
the four system calls (<tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>exit()</tt>, and
<tt>sigreturn()</tt>) allowed by the original seccomp mode.
</p>

<p>
For instance, <tt>open()</tt> might be allowed, but only to open
files for
reading.  Or, the <tt>write()</tt> system call might be restricted to
certain file descriptors (say, 1 and 2 for <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt>).  Meanwhile,
all other system calls, including powerful calls that attackers might want
to use, such as <tt>execve()</tt> or <tt>socket()</tt>, would be disabled.
As with the C interface, the actions taken when a disallowed system call
is made depend on how the library is initialized. Those calls could
cause the program to be killed, to receive a signal, to generate a
<tt>ptrace()</tt> event, or for the call to
fail with a particular <tt>errno</tt> value.
</p>

<p>
Using the Python bindings is similar in many ways to calling the library
directly from C:
<pre>
    import sys, os
    from seccomp import *

    f = SyscallFilter(defaction=KILL)

    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "open")
    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "write", Arg(0, EQ, sys.stdout.fileno()))

    f.load()

    x = os.open('/tmp/x', os.O_WRONLY)
    os.write(x, 'Hello, world\n')
</pre>

That, at least conceptually, will create the filter object, add two rules,
and load it, which will cause the <tt>write()</tt> to fail.  The rules
allow the <tt>open()</tt> system call, but only allow calling
<tt>write()</tt> on the <tt>stdout</tt> file descriptor.  The initialization of the
filter object chooses the <tt>KILL</tt> default action, which means the
program will be terminated if it uses disallowed system calls.

<p>
However
there is a bit more to it than that.  
When testing the non-error path by commenting out
the <tt>os.write()</tt>, Python requires <tt>brk()</tt>,
<tt>rt_sigaction()</tt>, and <tt>exit_group()</tt> to exit gracefully.  So
the following would need to be added to the list of rules:
<pre>
    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "exit_group")
    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "rt_sigaction")
    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "brk")
</pre>
</p>

<p>
While that does add to the list of allowed system calls, it
doesn't really enlarge what an attacker could do when subverting this
(extremely simple) program.
Using the Python version of <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>, instead
of those from the <tt>os</tt> module, requires opening up several more
system calls (<tt>mmap()</tt>, <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>close()</tt>, and
<tt>fstat()</tt>), which could be a bigger problem.
Having both <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>read()</tt> available
might allow an attacker to access files, but the contents can
only be written to <tt>stdout</tt>, which may well be an impediment.  Further
refinement of the rules could limit an attacker even further.
</p>

<p>
When debugging seccomp filters, there is often a need to track down which
system call caused a failure.
That can be done a number of
different ways.  When the <tt>KILL</tt> action is used, as above, the process is
forced to exit (with <tt>SIGSYS</tt> as its status), so the shell
simply prints "Bad system call". But it also leaves an
audit trail that records the system call number that failed:
<pre>
    type=SECCOMP msg=audit(1425421709.486:42015): auid=1000 uid=1000
      gid=1000 ses=1 subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
      pid=25113 comm="python" exe="/usr/bin/python2.7" sig=31 arch=c000003e
      <b>syscall=5</b> compat=0 ip=0x7faf36e38824 code=0x0
</pre>    
One easy way
to turn the number reported into a name is by using the
<tt>scmp_sys_resolver</tt> 
tool that is bundled with libseccomp.  Another option for determining which
system call is causing a failure would be to switch to the
<tt>TRAP</tt> action when setting up the filter object, then add a signal
handler for the <tt>SIGSYS</tt> signal that gets generated when disallowed
system calls are made.  Using <tt>ptrace()</tt> or <tt>strace</tt> are
possibilities as well.
</p>

<p>
Rules can be built using the <tt>Arg()</tt> function to specify the
allowable values for up to six arguments.  Those values can be tested using 
the usual comparison operators, but by name (e.g. <tt>EQ</tt> for =,
<tt>GE</tt> for &gt;=,
<tt>LT</tt> for &lt;, and so on).  There is also a <tt>MASKED_EQ</tt>
operator that can be used for flag values:
<pre>
    f.add_rule(ALLOW, "open",
               Arg(1, MASKED_EQ, os.O_RDONLY,
                   os.O_RDONLY | os.O_RDWR | os.O_WRONLY))
</pre>
That rule would ensure that of the three file access flags, only
<tt>O_RDONLY</tt> is set, so <tt>open()</tt> would only be allowed for reads.
</p>

<p>
The 2.2.0 release comes with a test suite that includes both C and Python
versions of each test.  It also has man pages for each of the C language
<tt>seccomp_*</tt> calls.  The only Python language documentation appears
to be in the <tt>src/python/seccomp.pyx</tt> file, but perhaps that will
change before long.  Anyone looking to sandbox their programs should
definitely take a peek at libseccomp.

I could be wrong about this but doesn't eBPF only pass up to five arguments to in-kernel functions which would mean that it can only check up to five arguments? Maybe "up to six arguments (non-inclusive)" was meant here :-)<br>

         Does this have, or would it be reasonable to add, a syscall truncation facility&mdash;some way to intercept specific calls and return successfully without doing anything?  That would be nice to have for programs that do something undesirable, like phoning home, but don't use the results.
<p>
ISTM that could be <i>really</i> useful for obnoxious Android apps.  Perhaps it could even return specific results, like saying my location is always at the north pole, for those that insist on knowing where I am, but do nothing useful (from my point of view) with it.

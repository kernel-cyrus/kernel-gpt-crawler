           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 7, 2008</br>

People who put their Linux systems under a certain amount of memory stress
- and who look at their logfiles - may notice an occasional message
indicating that a "page allocation failure" has occurred,
followed by a scary backtrace.  These people may also notice that,
despite the apocalyptic appearance of this message, the world often fails
to end.  In fact, the system tends to carry on just fine.  For this reason,
Dave Jones, who probably gets ten emails for every backtrace generated on a
Fedora system, has <a href="/Articles/276733/">suggested</a> that these
messages are simply noise which should be removed.  Whether that should
really happen is not entirely clear, though; understanding why requires a
bit of background.
<p>

In general, the kernel's memory allocator does not like to fail.  So, when
kernel code requests memory, the memory management code will work hard to
satisfy the request.  If this work involves pushing other pages out to swap
or removing data from the page cache, so be it.  A big exception happens,
though, when an atomic allocation (using the <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> flag) is
requested.  Code requesting atomic allocations is generally not in a
position where it can wait around for a lot of memory housecleaning work;
in particular, such code cannot sleep.  So if the memory manager is unable
to satisfy an atomic allocation with the memory it has in hand, it has no
choice except to fail the request.
<p>

Such failures are quite rare, especially when single pages are
requested.  The kernel works to keep some spare pages around at all times,
so the memory stress must be severe before a single-page allocation will
fail.  Multi-page allocations are harder, though; the kernel's memory
management code tends to fragment pages, making groups of
physically-contiguous pages hard to find.  In particular, if the system is
under pressure to the point that there is not much free memory available at
all, the chances of successfully allocating two (or more) contiguous pages
drops considerably.
<p>

Multi-page allocations are not often used in the kernel; they are avoided
whenever possible.  There are situations where they are necessary,
though.  One example is network drivers which (1)&nbsp;support the
transmission and reception of packets too large to fit into a single page,
and which (2)&nbsp;drive hardware which cannot perform scatter/gather I/O
on a single packet.  In this situation, the DMA buffers used for packets
must be larger than one page, and they must be physically contiguous.  This
is a situation which will become less 
pressing over time; scatter/gather capability in the hardware is
increasingly common, and drivers are being rewritten to make use of this
capability.  With sufficiently smart hardware, the need for multi-page
allocations goes down considerably.
<p>

But all of that skirts around the main point, which is that kernel code is
supposed to handle allocation failures properly.  There is never any
guarantee that memory will be available, so kernel code must be written
defensively.  Allocation failures must be handled without losing any
more capability than is strictly necessary.  If one assumes that kernel
code is written correctly, there should be no need to issue warnings on
allocation failures.  Things should just continue to work, perhaps without
users noticing at all.
<p>

And, in fact, things often do just work.  But the discussion resulting from
Dave's suggestion makes it clear that few developers are confident that all
kernel code does the right thing in the face of memory allocation
problems.  In cases where an allocation failure is <i>not</i> dealt with
correctly, the system may go down in random places, leaving few clues as to
what really happened.  In that kind of situation, the allocation failure
warning may be the only useful information which survives the crash.  For
this reason, some people want to see the warnings left in place.
<p>

As it happens, the memory allocator supports a special bit
(<tt>__GFP_NOWARN</tt>) which causes the warning not to be emitted if a
specific allocation fails.  So it has been suggested that the allocations
made from code which is known to handle failures properly have <tt>__GFP_NOWARN</tt>
set.  That would kill the warnings in code known to do the right thing
while leaving it for all other callers, presumably limiting the warnings to
places where there might truly be a problem.  Jeff Garzik <a
href="/Articles/276734/">strongly opposed this idea</a>, though, saying
that it clutters up the code and "punishes good behavior."
<p>

The other reason given for keeping the warnings in place is to make it
clear when a system is running under persistent memory pressure.  Such
systems will not be performing optimally; often there are changes which can
be made to relieve the pressure and help the system to run more smoothly.
So it has been suggested that the warning could be reduced in frequency and
made less scary.  Nick Piggin <a href="/Articles/276735/">suggests</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So I think that the messages should stay, and they should print out
	some header to say that it is only a warning and if not happening
	too often then it is not a problem, and if it is continually
	happening then please try X or Y or post a message to lkml...
</div>
<p>
An alternative idea would be to keep some sort of counter somewhere which
could be queried by curious system administrators.
<p>
Of course, the <i>real</i> solution is to ensure that all kernel code is
robust in the face of allocation failures.  This can be hard to do, since
the error recovery paths in any code are not often exercised or tested.
Fortunately, the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/209257/">fault injection
framework</a> can help in this situation.  Kernel developers can use this
framework to simulate allocation failures in specific regions of code, then
watch to see what happens.  Your editor's impression, though, is that
relatively few developers are using this tool.  So confidence in the
kernel's handling of allocation failures may remain low, and the desire to
keep the warning around may remain high.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I had once implemented what we called Hostile Memory Allocator.(HMA)
I checked in the code without doing extensive testing. It caused lot
of pain and it took me more than a month to stabilize the code.
This can be disabled during production builds.

 In memory allocation code we can do something like this:

  if (some randomly generated condition) &amp;&amp; (request is atomic)
      return NULL

Best Regards,
Suresh.

A friend is currently writing a library to stress-test user space applications against
undefined behaviour in various standards, and various failure modes that should (almost?)
always be handled correctly. Try running Firefox under this:

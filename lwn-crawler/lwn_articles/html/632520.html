<p>
Linux capabilities have long been seen as a way to avoid setuid programs,
though the reality hasn't really lived up to the hope.  While partitioning root
privileges into distinct, fine-grained permissions has a lot of conceptual
merit, the implementation suffers from a number of shortcomings that make
it difficult to, say, use capabilities to allow <tt>ping</tt> and other
utilities to run without 
being setuid root.  Actually using capabilities has always been complex,
and there 
are some fundamental limitations that are sometimes worked around in
out-of-tree patches.  A recent discussion on the linux-kernel mailing list
looks at one of the limitations of the capabilities model, with an eye
toward eliminating it.
</p>

<p>
Under the current model, processes cannot easily pass
their capabilities to another program through an <tt>execve()</tt> call
in the same way that other privileges are inherited.  Christoph Lameter
<a href="/Articles/631498/">posted a patch</a> that would allow administrators
to specify which capabilities should be inherited by programs started by
<tt>execve()</tt>.  The idea is to allow privileged, non-setuid-root programs to spawn other programs with a limited set of
privileges—exactly the kind of facility that capabilities are supposed to
provide. 
</p>

<p>
We have <a href="/Kernel/Index/#Capabilities">looked at Linux
capabilities</a> multiple times over the years, often in the context of a
new attempt to fix some of the deficiencies in the existing Linux capabilities
model (which is derived from a defunct POSIX effort).  For example, <a href="/Articles/211883/">file-based
capabilities</a> were added to use the extended attributes (xattrs) on
program files to
store capability information so that those capabilities were granted to
programs when they were executed.  Adding that allowed the <a
href="/Articles/256519/"><tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> capability to return to its
original meaning</a> and provided a way for administrators to grant
capabilities to individual programs (rather than running processes).
There are other problems we have noted; in some sense, this article is a
continuation of that trend.
</p>

<p>
Lameter described his use case in the patch.  He runs a network stack in
user space that requires privileges for raw network access, but also may
run arbitrary binary programs.
He would like to restrict what those programs can do, but needs them to
have a certain subset of root privileges.
That could be done using setuid programs, but
he would like to restrict those programs so that they don't get all of root's
privileges.

<p>
A <a href="/Articles/199004/">2006 LWN article</a>
that Lameter referenced in his posting describes the underpinnings of
capabilities. In particular, it looks at the different capability sets and
how they are combined to determine which capabilities a process has.

<p>
This first patch from Lameter provides a way for an administrator to globally
specify which 
capabilities should be inherited across <tt>execve()</tt>.  Capability
numbers could be written to a sysfs file, which would cause those
capabilities to be inherited by any new program if the caller of
<tt>execve()</tt> possessed them.
He has been using a form of the patch in production for the
last six years, but would like it (or something that solves the same
problem) to go upstream, so that he doesn't need to continue carrying the
patch in his kernels.

<p>
The usual way to make a binary run with some capability is to put that
capability in the "permitted" and "effective" sets of the binary using the file
capabilities xattrs. Doing that makes those binaries <i>always</i> have
those capabilities, however, which may not be desired—especially for
system binaries.
Without putting file capabilities on many different binaries
throughout the system, there is no way to pass <tt>CAP_NET_RAW</tt> (or
others, such as <tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt> and <tt>CAP_SYS_NICE</tt>) down to
child processes or new programs started with <tt>execve()</tt>.  Also,
given that 
there is scripting (and <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt>) involved in Lameter's use
case, it would be necessary to 
give script interpreters (e.g. Bash, Python)
whichever capabilities the scripts 
need—something that is not likely to lead to a more secure system.
</p>

<p>
It looks like a fundamental limitation of the Linux capabilities model, but
is hardly the first.  Capabilities bits have been <a
href="/Articles/486306/">arbitrarily chosen</a> by kernel feature
developers over the years, without much in the way of coordination.  That has led to grab-bag
capabilities like <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> that are effectively equivalent to
root (though <a
href="http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2522">there are
others</a> where that is also true). Whatever can be said about the Linux
capabilities feature, 
coherence 
in its design and implementation are not particularly evident.
</p>

<p>
But people who want to use the feature keep running up against barriers to
doing so. As Serge Hallyn, one of the developers of capabilities, <a
href="/Articles/632612/">lamented</a>, it is 
still not possible to make <tt>ping</tt> use capabilities (rather than
setuid) by default.
That's because some filesystems don't have support for xattrs; it's also
true for 
some of the tools, such as older versions of <tt>tar</tt> and current
versions of <tt>cpio</tt> (though <a href="/Articles/632613/">work is being
done</a> to change that).
</p>

<p>
But the global nature of the inheritance setting in Lameter's patch set was
not popular. Both Hallyn and Andy Lutomirski suggested ways to make it a
per-process or per-user-namespace setting.  Hallyn <a
href="/Articles/632721/">suggested</a> adding an "ambient inheritable" set
that would be combined with the inheritable set in a way that is somewhat
analogous to the <a href="/1999/1202/kernel.php3">capability bounding
set</a>.  Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/632725/">thought</a> that a single
bit could be used to say that all files should be considered to have a full
set of 
capabilities in their inherited set, which would basically have the same effect.
</p>

<p>
But Casey Schaufler <a href="/Articles/632727/">objected</a> to the idea
that Lameter's use case was reasonable from a security
perspective: "<q>You're getting into pretty sketchy territory using that kind
of a programming model in a security enforcing environment.</q>"  Though he
also responded to Lameter's claim that there is a "<q>capabilities
mess</q>" that needs to be cleaned up:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'm game to participate in such an effort. The POSIX scheme
is workable, but given that it's 20 years old and hasn't
developed real traction it's hard to call it successful.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of ways that capabilities could be improved but,
as Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/632736/">noted</a>, none of that addressed
the problem at hand: "<q>If I hold a
capability and I want to pass that capability to an exec'd helper, I
shouldn't need the fs's help to do this.</q>"  There was general
agreement, though Hallyn <a href="/Articles/632739/">pointed out</a> that
using the filesystem to place capabilities on binaries is how POSIX
capabilities work.  
</p>

<p>
One interesting side note from the discussion is that Lameter is not the
only one to use inheritable capabilities in production: the MeeGo-based N9
phone from Nokia <a href="/Articles/632740/">did as well</a>.
</p>

<p>
After that discussion, Lameter shifted gears, posting an <a
href="/Articles/632743/">RFC patch</a> to implement Hallyn's suggestion of an ambient
capability set.  That was met with a couple of objections on some of the
specifics.
To start with, 
adding capabilities to the ambient set should not enable
capabilities that are not in the 
permitted set of the process, Lutomirski <a
href="/Articles/632776/">said</a>.  He also suggested that adding
capabilities to the ambient set should require more than just having the
<tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> capability. Requiring
<tt>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</tt> (see this <a
href="/Articles/475678/">article</a> and <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt"><tt>Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt</tt></a>
for more information), so that <tt>execve()</tt> could not add any
additional privileges, would make him more comfortable.  But that
"<q>would make the patch 
pointless</q>" because programs that require more privileges
(e.g. setuid root programs) need to be run sometimes, Lameter <a
href="/Articles/632778/">said</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Given Lameter's use case, requiring <tt>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</tt> would seem
to be a non-starter, but he has addressed the other complaints from Lutomirski
and Hallyn in his <a href="/Articles/632113/">V1 ambient capability set
patch</a>.  In that version, only capabilities that are permitted can be
added to the ambient set.  In addition, processes can clear their permitted
set and be sure that no new capabilities will be granted to children or
programs run via <tt>execve()</tt> based on the contents of the ambient
set.  That was one of the main concerns expressed about the RFC patch.
</p>

<p>
As was noted in the threads, there are a number of barriers in the way of
using capabilities on Linux systems.  They are complex to reason about,
have an API that is difficult to use, and have been inconsistently applied
over the years.  All of that is unfortunate, but any movement to remove
capabilities and start over, as was suggested, is pretty unlikely to gain
any traction.  For 
good or ill, capabilities are part of the kernel ABI and are thus likely to
be with us "forever".  Changes like the ambient set may not reduce the
complexity at all, but may help provide a more usable capabilities system
going forward.

I wonder why most server-like programs still insist on binding the socket themselves rather than either accepting the socket on stdin or from an external proxy wrapper. It solves CAP_NET_BIND problems and gives administrator more flexibility with socket configuration.<br>

Using systemd for socket initialization with services that opens more then one port or those that cannot be lazily initialized requires to use systemd-specific API and still does not allow to bind low ports for user processes unless one uses the system instance of systemd.<br>
<p>
Instead it would be better if services allow to specify an external command that returns the bound socket so one can use whatever mechanism to bind the port like dynamic port numbers etc. and integration with systemd becomes trivial.<br>

ssh lets you do something like this for connecting to unusual targets with the ProxyCommand option when combined with ProxyUseFdpass.<br>
<p>
By default ProxyCommand requires the process to proxy the messages between stdin and stdout, but if you set ProxyUseFdpass, the proxy command is passed a socket pair instead, and should send a file descriptor over its stdout. So rather than having your proxy command needing to constantly process data, it can pass the connection back to ssh.<br>
<p>
I'd guess the reason why more services don't let you do stuff like this is that it's awkward to do in C, and the networking abstractions in most of the programming languages I use don't support it.<br>

Indeed, I've often had reason to start a service on a non-fixed-port, and ephemeral ports are a better solution than launching the service on a random port in a loop until it finds one successfully.<br>
<p>
I usually end up with a wrapper program that binds to an ephemeral port and writes out which port was chosen to a named pipe before launching the program in inetd mode.<br>

Lots of services expect the interface and port to be configured in the configuration file. Moving it to a helper process would require having some sort of "external" configuration which might not be appropriate for existing tools.<br>

I don't quite see why in his case he cant use a program with capabilities to bind the raw socket and then pass that on to other programs, but perhaps that gets too complicated.<br>
<p>
The ping example is also odd, as we have specific ping sockets to solve this problem, but as far as I can see they have not reached mainstream distros. No idea why not.<br>
<p>
The capsicum capability model seems nicer to use than Linux capabilities; it is in FreeBSD but is being ported to Linux. You do need to be able to pass around file descriptors though still, or have other programs do operations on your behalf.<br>

<p>
Except in the most common case of fork and exec, where the descriptors are simply inherited. As in the cases being considered here.
</p>

<p>
The problem with solutions like POSIX capabilities and SELinux is that, all things being equal, the person most capable of judging the correct security policy is the software developer, especially when you're talking about modes of execution instead of simply access to user data. The developer needs tools which work well from a programmatic perspective; from his perspective it's not a configuration problem, but primarily a problem of mechanism and logic. But typical security solutions divorce policy from mechanism in a way that cripples and burdens the ability of the software developer to easily implement the most correct policy.

<p>
It would be _really_ nice if Capsicum gained momentum. It's a simple concept that has an astoundingly strong ability to solve privilege problems. And it integrates beautifully into the Unix process and object model. It's basically the most obvious and correct approach, at least in hindsight. But Linux has always suffered from a very bad case of NIH syndrome, and the fact that FreeBSD has incorporated Capsicum is probably a negative in terms of the likelihood of Linux hackers being excited and motivated to seriously consider Capsicum. More likely if they turn in the general direction of Capsicum it will be as a hack on existing Linux mechanisms with neither the simplicity, conciseness, or portability of the Capsicum model.
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="https://github.com/google/capsicum-linux">developers porting Capsicum to Linux</a>. Actually, more like ported (past tense) at this point, because the bulk of the work has been done. But there are a million groups who have ported a million different things to Linux. But if it's not in mainline, it's irrelevant.

Couldn't Mr Lameter's use case be solved by adding the required capabilities to the helper executable files' Inheritable set, but leaving their Permitted set empty?<br>
<p>
The initial application would then add those capabilities to its Inheritable set before execve(), which would mean that they end up in the new process's Permitted set.  On the other hand if those files are run by a process with an empty Inheritable set (ie. a normal unprivileged process) then the new process would end up with an empty Permitted set.<br>
<p>
Am I missing something? <br>

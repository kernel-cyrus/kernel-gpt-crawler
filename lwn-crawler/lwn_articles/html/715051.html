           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 22, 2017</br>
           </div>
The transition to the version-2 control-group API has been <a
href="/Articles/574317/">underway</a> for a 
few years now.  Most resource controllers work with the new interface, but
there is a notable exception in the form of the CPU controller, which has
been <a href="/Articles/697366/">stalled</a> as a result of disagreements
over thread-level control.  A new proposal for a control-group "thread
mode" has generated more disagreement but, maybe, some hope for a
resolution as well.
<p>
When the control-group interface was reworked, two fundamental design
decisions shaped the result in ways that are relevant to the CPU
controller.  Control groups would no longer be allowed to 
contain both processes and other groups; instead, control groups would be
internal to the group hierarchy and processes would be placed only at the
leaves.  The new API also differs from the original in that it only
allows entire processes to be placed within a 
group; if a process is multi-threaded, all of its threads must be in
the same group.  There are solid reasons for these decisions: for many
controllers, it is difficult to define rational semantics when processes
and groups are competing in the same parent group, and a number of
resources (memory usage, for example) are not amenable to control at the
thread level.
<p>
Some controllers, though, can work well in a more flexible mode; the CPU
controller is at the top of that list.  It makes sense for processes to
compete with control groups for the CPU, and it is often desirable to apply
different CPU-usage policies to different threads within the same process.
The version-2 API make such configurations impossible, though, to the
<a href="/Articles/656115/">dismay</a> of users who felt they had lost an
important capability.  Potential 
solutions to this problem have been under discussion for some time.  A
separate "<a href="/Articles/679940/">resource groups</a>" mechanism was
proposed almost one year ago, for example, but it brought little
satisfaction and did not get far.
<p>
Control-group maintainer Tejun Heo's <a href="/Articles/713463/">latest
attempt</a> is called "thread mode".  Rather than create a new "resource
group" abstraction under application control, it extends the control-group
mechanism to provide special groups at the leaves of the hierarchy.
Consider, for example, a traditional control-group hierarchy that looks
like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cgtm1.png" width=302 height=182
	alt="[Control-group hierarchy]">
</blockquote>
<p>
There are two control groups ("A" and "B") below the root group.  The
process P1 is contained within A, while P2 and P3 are inside B.  This
hierarchy follows the rules, since all processes are found at the leaves. 
<p>
With the new thread mode, the administrator can designate any empty control
group 
as being a "thread point".  This group can then be populated with a
hierarchy of "thread groups" 
below it.  Thread groups look like regular control groups, but with some
significant 
differences: they can contain both threads and other thread groups, and a
single process's threads can be spread across multiple thread groups.  A
hierarchy using this feature might look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cgtm2.png" width=302 height=232
	alt="[Control-group hierarchy]">
</blockquote>
<p>
The thread groups ("T1" and "T2") form their own hierarchy below B, which
has been marked as a thread point.  Note that T1 is able to
contain both the thread group T2 and the process P3.  In this example, the
"processes" P2 and P3 could, in fact, be threads belonging to the same
process.
<p>
Resource controllers that are not explicitly enabled for thread mode will
never see the hierarchy above; instead, the thread groups will, from their
point of view, be collapsed out of existence and the hierarchy will look as
it did in the first diagram above.  Controllers that are able to deal with
the thread mode will see the entire hierarchy, though, and will be able to
perform resource control at thread granularity.
<p>
Scheduler maintainer Peter Zijlstra, who has been an ongoing critic of the
control-group changes, <a href="/Articles/715059/">was not entirely
pleased</a> with this version either.  In particular, he disliked the
constraint that the thread groups can only appear at the bottom of the
hierarchy.  The <a href="/Articles/715060/">use case</a> he has in mind
involves running a threaded workload directly out of the root group,
resulting in a hierarchy looking something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cgtm3.png" width=302 height=192
	alt="[Control-group hierarchy]">
</blockquote>
<p>
The main reason for running the workload in the root group would appear to
be performance; there is a small cost to putting processes lower in the
hierarchy.  Zijlstra would still like to apply full resource control to
other groups that might, for example, contain a virtual machine running
some sort of secondary workload.  Heo's current patch will not support this
mode, though, since threaded groups cannot be contained within the same
parent group as non-threaded groups.
<p>
That restriction exists because to do otherwise would be a violation of the
"no internal processes" rule.  For non-thread-capable controllers, the
thread groups would vanish and the processes contained therein would appear
to be contained in the parent — the root group in this case. That would
bring back all of the problems that this rule was created to avoid.
<p>
There was some strongly worded back-and-forth over whether Zijlstra's use
case was something that needed to be (or could be) supported but, in the end,
both developers were clearly interested in working out a solution that
satisfied the constraints.  The form that solution will take is not
entirely clear, but Heo <a href="/Articles/715062/">outlined</a> one
possibility.  When a threaded group would share the same parent group as a
non-threaded group, the answer is to interpose another group.  So, rather
than putting T1 directly in the root group as shown above, it would be
placed in a new group (call it "C"), and C would be located under the
root.  That moves the threaded group back out to a leaf, resolving the
issues.  The intermediate group could be hidden from administrators, but it
would need to be there internally.
<p>
Zijlstra had actually wanted to make things even more flexible by allowing
a threaded group to contain a non-threaded group — essentially doing the
thread-point transition in reverse.  That would complicate things even
further and, in 
the absence of compelling use cases calling for it, that mode seems
unlikely to be implemented.
<p>
The real proof will come with a subsequent version of the patch set.  There
will, undoubtedly, be further disagreements to be worked out.  But it seems
possible that this work might finally be on a path where it can get past
the roadblocks that have kept it out of the mainline until now.  That would
be a welcome end to a project that has taken rather longer than anybody
involved would have expected or wanted.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

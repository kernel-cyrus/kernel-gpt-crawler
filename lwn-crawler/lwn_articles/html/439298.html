Swapping, like page writeback, operates under some severe constraints.  The
ability to write dirty pages to backing store is critical for memory
management; it is the only way those pages can be freed for other uses.  So
swapping must work well in situations where the system has almost no memory
to spare.  But writing pages to backing store can, itself, require memory.
This problem has been well solved (with mempools) for locally-attached
devices, but network-attached devices add some extra challenges which have
never been addressed in an entirely satisfactory way.
<p>
This is not a new problem, of course; LWN <a href="/Articles/129703/">ran
an article about swapping over network block devices</a> (NBD) almost
exactly six years ago.  Various approaches were suggested then, but none
were merged; it remains to be seen whether <a href="/Articles/438407/">the
latest attempt</a> (posted by Mel Gorman based on a lot of work by Peter
Zijlstra) will be more successful. 
<p>
The kernel's page allocator makes a point of only giving out its last pages
to processes which are thought to be working to make more memory free.  In
particular, a process must have either the <tt>PF_MEMALLOC</tt> or
<tt>TIF_MEMDIE</tt> flag set; <tt>PF_MEMALLOC</tt> indicates that the
process is currently performing <a href="/Articles/368869/">memory
compaction</a> or direct reclaim, while <tt>TIF_MEMDIE</tt> means the
process has run afoul of the out-of-memory killer and is trying to exit.
This rule should serve to keep some memory around for times when it is
needed to make more memory free, but one aspect of this mechanism does not
work entirely well: its interaction with slab allocators.
<p>
The slab allocators grab whole pages and hand them out in smaller chunks.
If a process marked with <tt>PF_MEMALLOC</tt> or <tt>TIF_MEMDIE</tt>
requests an object from the slab allocator, that allocator can use a
reserved page to satisfy the request.  The problem is that the remainder of
the page is then made available to any other process which may make a
request; it could, thus, be depleted by processes which are making the
memory situation worse, not better.
<p>
So one of the first things Mel's patch series does is to adapt a patch by
Peter that adds more awareness to the slab allocators.  A new
boolean value (<tt>pfmemalloc</tt>) is added to <tt>struct page</tt> to
indicate that the corresponding page was allocated from the reserves; the
recipient of the page is then expected to treat it with due care.  Both
slab and SLUB have been modified to recognize this flag and reserve the
rest of the page for suitably-marked processes.  That change should help to
ensure that memory is available where it's needed, but at the cost of
possibly failing other memory allocations even though there are objects
available.
<p>
The next step is to add a <tt>__GFP_MEMALLOC</tt> GFP flag to mark
allocation requests which can dip into the reserves.  This flag separates
the marking of urgent allocation requests from the process state - a change
will be useful later in the series, where there may be no convenient
process state available.  It will be interesting to see how long it takes
for some developer to attempt to abuse this flag elsewhere in the kernel.
<p>
The big problem with network-based swap is that extra memory is required
for the network protocol processing.  So, if network-based swap is to work
reliably, 
the networking layer must be able to access the memory reserves.  Quite a
bit of network processing is done in software interrupt handlers which run
independently of any given process.  The <tt>__GFP_MEMALLOC</tt> flag
allows those handlers to access reserved memory, once a few other tweaks
have been added as well.
<p>
It is not desirable to allow <i>any</i> network operation to access the
reserves, though; bittorrent and web browsers should not be allowed to
consume that memory when it is urgently needed elsewhere.  A new function,
<tt>sk_set_memalloc()</tt>, is added to mark sockets which are involved
with memory reclaim.  Allocations for those sockets will use the
<tt>__GFP_MEMALLOC</tt> flag, while all other sockets have to get by with
ordinary allocation priority.  It is assumed that only sockets managed
within the kernel will be so marked; any socket which ends up in user space
should not be able to access the reserves.  So swapping onto a FUSE
filesystem is still not something which can be expected to work.
<p>
There is one other problem, though: incoming packets do not have a special
"needed for memory reclaim" flag on them.  So the networking layer must be
able to allocate memory to hold <i>all</i> incoming packets for at least as
long as it takes to identify the important ones.  To that end, any network
allocation for incoming data is allowed to dip into the reserves if need
be.  Once a packet has been identified and associated with a socket, that
socket's flags can be checked; if the packet was allocated from the
reserves and the destination socket is <i>not</i> marked as being used for
memory reclaim, the packet will be dropped immediately.  That change should
allow important packets to get into the system without consuming too much
memory for unimportant traffic.
<p>
The result should be a system where it is safe to swap over a network block
device.  At least, it should be safe if the low watermark - which controls
how much memory is reserved - is high enough.  Systems which are swapping
over the net may be expected to make relatively heavy use of the reserves,
so administrators may want to raise the watermark (found in
<tt>/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes</tt>) accordingly.  The final patch in the
series keeps an eye on the reserves and start throttling processes
performing direct reclaim if they get too low; the idea here is to ensure
that enough memory remains for a smaller number of reclaimers to actually
get something done.  Adjusting the size of the reserves dynamically might
be the better solution in the long run, but that feature has been omitted
for now in the interest of keeping the patch series from getting too large.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

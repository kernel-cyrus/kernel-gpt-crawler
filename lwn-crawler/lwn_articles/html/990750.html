<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 20, 2024</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, 6,778 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the
mainline kernel for the 6.12 release — over half of the work that had been
staged in linux-next prior to the opening of the merge window.  There has
been a lot of refactoring and cleanup work this time around, but also some
significant changes.  Read on for a summary of the first half of the 6.12
merge window.
<p>
The most significant changes pulled to date include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The Arm "permission overlay extension" feature is now supported,
     making <a href="/Articles/826554/">memory protection keys</a>
     available on that architecture.
<li> There are now separate configuration options for each x86 Spectre
     mitigation technique, allowing kernels to be customized to specific
     processor models.
<li> The Loongarch, 64-bit Arm, PowerPC, and s390 architectures have all
     gained support for <a href="/Articles/983186/">the vDSO implementation
     of the <tt>getrandom()</tt> system call</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Io_uring operations can now have absolute timeouts, along with the
     relative timeouts that were already supported.
<li> The remaining pieces of the <a href="/Articles/934415/">deadline
     server mechanism</a> have been merged.  Deadline servers replace
     realtime throttling with a special server task running under the deadline
     scheduler; it ensures that normal-priority tasks get a small chance to
     run even if a realtime task is monopolizing the CPUs.
<li> Also completed in this cycle was the <a
     href="/Articles/969062/">EEVDF</a> scheduler, which replaces the
     completely fair scheduler and, with luck, provides better response
     times.
<li> Some of the preliminary work needed for the merging of the
     <a href="/Articles/974387/">extensible scheduling class</a>
     (sched_ext) has
     landed.  The <a href="/ml/all/ZuOULxlZmbvY1skN@slm.duckdns.org">pull
     request</a> for sched_ext itself has also been sent, but 
     has not been acted upon as of this writing; it seems likely to be
     pulled before the merge window closes.
<li> A <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/baeb9a7d8b60">simple
     series</a> allowing realtime preemption to be configured in mainline
     kernels has been merged.  This change <a
     href="/Articles/990985/">marks a milestone</a> in a 20-year
     development effort to bring realtime response to a general-purpose
     kernel.  </ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html"><tt>fcntl()</tt></a>
     operation (<tt>F_CREATED_QUERY</tt>) that allows an application to
     determine whether a file opened with <tt>O_CREAT</tt> was actually
     created (rather than already existing).
<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html"><tt>name_to_handle_at()</tt></a>
     system call has gained the ability to provide unique, 64-bit mount
     IDs, eliminating a racy workaround needed until now; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4356d575ef0f">this commit</a> for
     some more information.
<li> The size of <tt>struct file</tt> within the kernel has been reduced
     from 232 bytes to 184; that will provide significant memory savings on
     systems running file-heavy workloads.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3352633ce6b2">this commit</a> for a
     description of how that reduction was accomplished.
<li> It is no longer possible to mount a filesystem on top of any of the
     ephemeral files in <tt>/proc</tt> — the files under
     <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/fd</tt>, for example.  Allowing such mounts makes
     little sense and can be a security problem, so it was removed as a
     bug; see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d80b065bb172">this
     commit</a> for more information.
<li> The namespace filesystem (nsfs) has gained the ability to provide more
     information about mount namespaces; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9020d0d844ad">this commit</a> for
     details. 
<li> The EROFS filesystem can now mount filesystems directly from images
     stored in files; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb176750266a">this commit</a> for
     more details.	
<li> The XFS filesystem has gained two <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands that will
     exchange the contents of two files.  <tt>XFS_IOC_START_COMMIT</tt>
     sets up the exchange, while <tt>XFS_IOC_COMMIT_RANGE</tt> actually
     effects the exchange, but only if the second file has not changed in
     the meantime.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/41c38bf024ab">This commit</a>
     contains a man page for these operations.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     Analog Devices ADP5585 GPIO controllers.
<li> <b>Input</b>:
     Goodix GT7986U SPI HID touchscreens.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Rockchip true random number generators,
     Arm NI-700 performance-monitoring units,
     Mobileye EyeQ reset controllers,
     Nuvoton MA35D1 SDHCI controllers,
     Analog Devices ADP5585 pulse-width modulators, and
     Microsoft Surface thermal sensors.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     AMCC QT2025 PHYs (implemented in Rust),
     Rockchip CAN-FD controllers,
     Realtek Automotive Switch 9054/9068/9072/9075/9068/9071 PCIe Interfaces,
     OPEN Alliance TC6 10BASE-T1x MAC-PHYs, and
     Microchip LAN8650/1 Rev.B0/B1 MACPHY Ethernet chips.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     MediaTek MT6357 codecs.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/979549/">device memory TCP patch set</a> has
     been merged.  It provides an optimized data-transfer path for
     applications that are transferring data between the network and a
     peripheral device without the need to go through the CPU.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/983169/"><tt>FOLL_FORCE</tt> removal patch</a>
     has been merged.  This internal kernel flag had been used by
     <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/mem</tt>, making it an attractive target for
     attackers.  Its removal can break some systems, so it is not effective
     by default; the <tt>proc_mem.force_override=</tt> command-line
     parameter can be used to change it.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/41e8149c8892">this commit</a> for a
     bit more information.
<li> The security-module subsystem now <a href="/Articles/979683/">uses
     static calls</a> for almost all callbacks, improving both performance
     and security.
<li> The Integrity Policy Enforcement security module has been added.
     According to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a430d95c5efa">the
     merge message</a>: "<q>the basic motivation behind
   IPE is to provide a mechanism such that administrators can restrict
   execution to only those binaries which come from integrity protected
   storage</q>".  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ac6731870ed9">this documentation
     commit</a> for more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> 64-Bit Arm kernels can now run as a guest on <a
     href="/Articles/836693/">protected KVM</a> systems.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <tt>msleep()</tt> has long added an extra jiffy (scheduler clock
     tick) to the requested sleep time to ensure that the caller did not
     wake too soon.  That padding has not been necessary to meet that
     requirement for some time, so it has been removed in 6.12.
<li> The final set of <a href="/Articles/951337/"><tt>printk()</tt>
     improvements</a> has been merged.  This was the last significant
     piece of the realtime preemption patch set that remained out
     of tree.
<li> The interface to <tt>kmem_cache_create()</tt> has changed
     significantly.  It now accepts a pointer to a <tt>kmem_cache_args</tt>
     structure describing how the cache should be created; at this time,
     that structure can be best seen in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b7ff9ab98af">this commit</a>.
     Thanks to some macro magic, calls to the older API still work as
     expected, but those calls can be expected to be migrated to the new
     API over time.
</ul>
<p>
The 6.12 merge window will likely remain open through September&nbsp;29.
Once it closes, LWN will be back with a summary of the rest of the changes
merged for the next major kernel release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           <p>This article was contributed by Joël Porquet</p>
           </div>
<p>This series of articles provides an overview of the procedure one
can follow when porting the Linux kernel to a new processor architecture. <a href="/Articles/654783/">Part
1</a> and <a href="/Articles/656286/">part 2</a> focused on the non-code-related
groundwork and the early code, from the assembly boot code to the creation of
the first kernel thread. Following on from those, the series concludes by
looking at the last portion of the procedure. As will be seen, most of the
remaining work for launching the 
<tt>init</tt> 
process deals with thread and process management.</p>

<h4>Spawning kernel threads</h4>

<p>When <tt>start_kernel()</tt> performs its last function call (to <tt>rest_init()</tt>), the memory-management
subsystem is 
fully operational, the boot processor is running and able to process both
exceptions and interrupts, and the system has a notion of time.</p>

<p>While the execution flow has so far been sequential and mono-threaded, the main
job handled by <tt>rest_init()</tt> before turning into the boot idle
thread is to 
create two kernel threads: <tt>kernel_init</tt>, which will be discussed in the next
section, and <tt>kthreadd</tt>. As one can imagine, creating these kernel
threads (and any other kinds of threads for that matter, from user threads
within the same process to actual processes) implies the existence of a complex
process-management infrastructure.  Most of the
infrastructure to create a new thread is not architecture-specific: operations
such as copying the <tt>task_struct</tt> structure or the credentials, setting up the
scheduler, and so on do not usually need any architecture-specific code.
However, the process-management code must define a few architecture-specific parts, mainly for setting up the
stack for each new thread and for switching between threads.</p>

<p>Linux always avoids creating new resources from scratch, especially new threads.
With the exception of the initial thread (the one that has so far been booting
the system and that we have implicitly been discussing), the kernel always
duplicates an 
existing thread and modifies the copy to make it into the desired new thread.
The same principle applies after thread creation, when the new thread's
execution begins for
the first time, as it is easier to resume the execution of a thread than to
start it from scratch. This mainly means that the newly allocated stack must be
initialized such that when switching to the new thread for the first
time, the thread looks like it is resuming its execution—as if it had simply
been stopped earlier.</p>

<p>To further understand this mechanism, delving a bit into the
thread-switching mechanism and more specifically into the switch of
execution flow 
implemented by the architecture-specific context-switching routine
<tt>switch_to()</tt> is required. This
routine, which is always written in assembly language, is always 
called by the current (soon to be previous) thread while returning as the next
(future current) thread. Part of this trick is achieved by saving the current
context in the stack of the current thread, switching stack pointers to use the
stack of the next thread, and restoring the saved context from it. As with a
typical function, <tt>switch_to()</tt> finally returns to the "calling"
function using 
the instruction address that had been saved on the stack of the newly current
thread.</p>

<p>In the case that the next thread had previously been running and was
temporarily 
removed from the processor, returning to the calling function would be a
normal event that 
would eventually lead the thread to resume the execution of its own code.
However, for a brand new thread, there would not have been any function to call
<tt>switch_to()</tt> in order to save the thread's context. This is why the stack of a
new thread must be initialized to pretend that there has been a previous
function call, enabling <tt>switch_to()</tt> to return after restoring this new thread.
Such a function is usually setup to be a few assembly lines acting as a trampoline
to the thread's code.</p>

<p>Note that switching to a kernel thread does not generally involve switching to
another page table since the kernel address space, in which all kernel
threads run, 
is defined in every page table structure. For user processes, the
switch to their own page table is performed by the architecture-specific routine
<tt>switch_mm()</tt>.</p> 

<h4>The first kernel thread</h4>

<p>As explained in the <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/init/main.c?v=4.2#L386">source
code</a>, the only reason the 
kernel thread <tt>kernel_init</tt> is created first is that it must obtain PID 1.
This is the PID that the <tt>init</tt> process (i.e. the first user space process born
from <tt>kernel_init</tt>) traditionally inherits.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the first task of <tt>kernel_init</tt> is to wait for the
second 
kernel thread, <tt>kthreadd</tt>, to be ready. <tt>kthreadd</tt> is the kernel thread daemon
in charge of asynchronously spawning new kernel threads whenever requested.
Once <tt>kthreadd</tt> is started, <tt>kernel_init</tt> proceeds with the
second phase of booting, which includes 
a few architecture-specific initializations.</p>

<p>In the case of a multiprocessor system, <tt>kernel_init</tt> begins by
starting the 
other processors before initializing the various subsystems composing the driver
model (e.g. devtmpfs, devices, buses, etc.) and, later, using the defined
initialization calls
to bring up the
actual device drivers for the underlying hardware system. Before getting into
the "fancy" device drivers (e.g. block device, framebuffer, etc.), it is
probably 
a good idea to focus on having at least an operational terminal (by implementing
the corresponding driver if necessary), especially since the early console
set up
by <tt>early_printk()</tt> is supposed to be replaced by a real,
full-featured console 
shortly after.</p>

<p>It is also through these initialization calls that the initramfs is unpacked
and the 
initial root filesystem (rootfs) is mounted. There are a <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/early-userspace/README">few options</a>
for mounting an initial rootfs but I have found <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt">initramfs</a> to be the
simplest when porting Linux. Basically this means that the rootfs is statically
built at compilation time and integrated into the kernel binary image.
After being mounted, the rootfs can give access to the mandatory
<tt>/init</tt> and 
<tt>/dev/console</tt>.</p>

<p>Finally, the init memory is freed (i.e. the memory containing code and data
that were used only during the initialization phase and that are no longer
needed) and the <tt>init</tt> process that has been found on the rootfs is launched.</p>

<h4>Executing init</h4>

<p>At this point, launching <tt>init</tt> will probably result in an immediate fault when
trying to fetch the first instruction. This is because, as with creating
threads, being able to execute the <tt>init</tt> process (and actually any user-space
application) first involves a bit of groundwork.</p>

<p>The function that needs to be implemented in order to solve the
instruction-fetching issue is the page fault handler. Linux is lazy, 
particularly when it comes to user applications and, by default, does not
pre-load the text and data of applications into memory. Instead, it only sets
up all of 
the kernel structures that are strictly required and lets applications fault at
their first instruction because the pages containing their text segment have
usually not been loaded yet.</p>

<p>This is actually perfectly intentional behavior since it is expected
that such a 
memory fault will be caught and fixed by the page fault handler. This handler
can be seen as an intricate switch statement that is able to treat every fault
related to memory: from <tt>vmalloc()</tt> faults that necessitate a
synchronization with 
the reference page table to stack expansions in user applications. In this case,
the handler will determine that the page fault corresponds to a valid virtual
memory area (VMA) of the application and will consequently load the missing page
in memory before retrying to run the application.</p>

<p>Once the page fault handler is able to catch memory faults, it is likely that an
extremely simple <tt>init</tt> process can be executed. However, it will not be able to
do much as it cannot yet request any service from the kernel through system
calls, such as printing to the terminal. To this end, the system-call
infrastructure must be completed with a few architecture-specific
parts. System calls are 
treated as software interrupts since they are accessed by a user
instruction that makes the processor automatically switch to kernel mode, like
hardware interrupts do. Besides defining the list of system calls supported
by the 
port, handling system calls involves enhancing the interrupt and exception
handler with the 
additional ability to receive them.</p>

<p>Once there is support for system calls, it should now be possible to
execute a "hello 
world" <tt>init</tt> that is able to open the main console and write a
message.  But 
there are still missing pieces in order to have a full-featured
<tt>init</tt> that is able to 
start other applications and communicate with them as well as exchange data with
the kernel.</p>

<p>The first step toward this goal concerns the management of signals and, more
particularly, signal delivery (either from another process or from
the kernel itself). If a process has defined a handler for a specific signal,
then this handler must be called whenever the given signal is pending. Such an
event occurs when the targeted process is about to get scheduled again. More
specifically, this means that when resuming the process, right at the moment of
the next transition back to user mode, the execution flow of the process must be
altered in order to execute the handler instead. Some space must also be made on
the application's stack for the execution of the handler. Once the handler has
finished its execution and has returned to the kernel (via a system call
that had 
been previously injected into the handler's context), the context of the
process is restored so that it can resume its normal execution.</p>

<p>The second and last step for fully running user-space applications deals with
user-space memory access: when the kernel wants to copy data from or to
user-space pages. Such an operation can be quite dangerous if, for example, the
application gives a bogus pointer, which would potentially result in kernel
panics (or security vulnerabilities) if it is not checked properly. To
circumvent this problem, it is 
necessary to 
write architecture-specific routines that use some assembly magic to
register the 
addresses of all of the instructions performing the actual accesses to the
user-space memory in an exception table. As explained in this <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0222/kernel.php3">LWN
article</a> from 2001, "<q>if ever a fault happens in kernel mode, the fault
handler scans through the exception table trying to match the address of the
faulting instruction with a table entry. If a match is found, a special error
exit is taken, the copy operation fails gracefully, and the system call returns
a segmentation fault error.</q>"</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Once a full-featured <tt>init</tt> process is able to run and give access to a shell,
it probably signals the end of the porting process. But it is most likely
only the 
beginning of the adventure, as the port now needs to be maintained (as the
internal APIs sometimes change quickly), and can also be enhanced in
numerous ways: 
adding support for multiprocessor and NUMA systems, implementing more device
drivers, etc.</p>

<p>By describing the long journey of porting Linux to a new processor architecture,
I hope that this series of articles will contribute to remedying the lack of
documentation in this area and will help the next brave programmer who one day
embarks upon this challenging, but ultimately rewarding, experience.</p>

      This series of articles helped me to get a good overview of how arch dependent code is tied with the arch independent code. For a further x86 arch specific details (although not specific for porting purposes at the time of writing this comment), other readers might be interested in reading <a href="https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/index.html">the linux-insides online book</a>.

Thank you very much for your effort!

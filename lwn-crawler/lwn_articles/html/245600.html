<h1>Smarter  write throttling</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 14, 2007</br>
           </div>
Whenever a process performs a normal, buffered <tt>write()</tt> to a file,
it ends up creating one or more dirty pages in memory.  Those pages must
eventually be written to disk.  Until the data moves to persistent storage,
the pages of memory it occupies cannot be used for any other purpose, even
if the original writing process, as is often the case, no longer needs
them.  It is important to prevent dirty pages from filling too much of the
system's memory; should the dirty pages take over, the system will find
itself under severe memory pressure, and may not even have enough memory to
perform the necessary writes and free more pages.  Avoiding this situation
is not entirely easy, though.
<p>

As a general rule, software can create dirty pages more quickly than
storage devices can absorb them.  So various mechanisms must be put in
place to keep the number of dirty pages at a manageable level.  One of
those mechanisms is a simple form of write throttling.  Whenever a process
dirties some pages, the kernel checks to see if the total number of dirty
pages in the system has gotten too high.  If so, the offending process is forced to do
some community service by writing pages to disk for a while.  Throttling
things in this way has two useful effects: dirty pages get written to disk
(and thus cleaned), and the process stops making more dirty pages for a
little while.
<p>

This mechanism is not perfect, however.  The process which gets snared by
the global dirty pages threshold may not be the one which actually dirtied
most of those pages; in this case, the innocent process gets put to work
while the real culprit continues making messes.  If the bulk of the dirty
pages must all be written to a single device, it might not be beneficial to
throttle processes working with files on other disks - the result
could be that traffic for one disk essentially starves the others which
could, otherwise, be performing useful work.  Overall, the use of a single
global threshold can lead to significant starvation of both processes and
devices.
<p>

It can get worse than that, even.  Consider what happens when block devices
are stacked - a simple LVM or MD device built on top of one or more
physical drives, for example.  A lot of I/O through the LVM level could
create large numbers of dirty pages destined for the physical device.
Should things hit the dirty thresholds at the LVM level, however, the
process could block before the physical drive starts writeback.  In the
worst case, the end result here is a hard deadlock of the system - and that
is not generally the sort of reliability that users expect of their
systems.

<p>

Peter Zijlstra has been working on a solution in the form of the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/244443/">per-device write throttling patch
set</a>.  The core idea is quite simple: rather than use a single, global
dirty threshold, each backing device gets its own threshold.  Whenever
pages are dirtied, the number of dirty pages which are destined for the
same device is examined, and the process is throttled if its specific
device has too many dirty pages outstanding.  No single device, then, is
allowed to be the destination for too large a proportion of the dirty
pages.
<p>

Determining what "too large" is can be a bit of a challenge, though.  One
could just divide the global limit equally among all block devices on the
system, but the end result would be far from optimal.  Some devices may
have a great deal of activity on them at any given time, while others are
idle.  One device might be a local, high-speed disk, while another is
NFS-mounted over a GPRS link.  In either case, one can easily argue that
the system will perform better if the faster, more heavily-used devices get
a larger share of memory than slow, idle devices.
<p>

To make things work that way, Peter has created a <a
href="/Articles/245603/">"floating proportions" library</a>.  In an
efficient, mostly per-CPU manner, this library can track events by source
and answer questions about what percentage of the total is coming from each
source.  In the writeback throttling patch, this library is used to count
the number of page writeback <i>completions</i> coming from each device.
So devices which are able to complete writeback more quickly will get a
larger portion of the dirty-page quota.  Devices which are generally more
active will also have a higher threshold.
<p>

The patch as described so far still does not solve the problem of one user
filling memory with dirty pages to the exclusion of others - especially if
users are contending for the bandwidth of a single device.  There is
another part of the patch, however, which tries to address this issue.
A different set of proportion counters is used to track how many pages are
being dirtied by each task.  When a page is dirtied and the system goes to
calculate the dirty threshold for the associated device, that threshold is
reduced proportionately to the task's contribution to the pile of dirty
pages.  So a process which is producing large numbers of dirty pages will
be throttled sooner than other processes which are more restrained.

<p>

This patch is in its eighth revision, and there has not been a lot of
criticism this time around.  Linus's <a
href="/Articles/245610/">response</a> was:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Ok, the patches certainly look pretty enough, and you fixed the
	only thing I complained about last time (naming), so as far as I'm
	concerned it's now just a matter of whether it *works* or not. I
	guess being in -mm will help somewhat, but it would be good to have
	people with several disks etc actively test this out.
</div>
<p>

The number of reports so far has been small, but some testers have said
that this patch makes their systems work better.  It was recently removed
from -mm "due to crashiness," though, so there are some nagging issues to
be taken care of yet.  In the longer term, the chances of it getting in
could be said to be fairly good - but, with memory management patches like
this, one never knows for sure.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Because there is a gap between when a page is dirtied and when it gets to the I/O scheduler.  Pages are not scheduled for writeback immediately upon dirtying - that's the page cache in action.  So, by the time the I/O scheduler gets involved, it's too late to keep more pages from being dirtied.

<p>
I don't see any deadlock in this description, but maybe I'm supposed to know something more about how LVM works.  (It doesn't make sense to me, for example, that a physical drive starts writeback; I expect a physical drive to be the <em>target</em> of a writeback).
<p>
But I've seen the pageout-based memory deadlock plenty of times in action when a process that has to move in order for memory to get clean (maybe it holds a lock for some dirty file) blocks on a memory allocation.  At least at one time, these were possible in Linux in various ways, network-based block devices and filesystems being the worst offenders, and people addressed it with tuning policies that sought to make it unlikely that the amount of clean allocatable memory ever shrank to zero.
<p>
"Throttling" usually refers to that sort of tuning -- a more or less arbitrary limit placed on how fast something can go.  I hope that's not what this is about, because it is possible actually to fix deadlocks -- make them mathematically impossible while still making the full resources of the system available to be apportioned any way you like.  It's not easy, but the techniques are well known (never wait for a Level N resource while holding a Level N+1 resource; have pools of memory at various levels).
<p>
I hate throttling.  Throttling is waiting for something artificial.  In a well-designed system, you can wait for real resource and never suffer deadlock or unfairness.

      Looking at it like a feedback system, the current negative feedback that limits writing at all is the amount of memory (or part of it thanks to tunables, but in the end it's memory that limits it). Practically this means you can have huge number of dirty pages outstanding, all waiting on one slow device.<br>
<p>
Now combine the facts that you can't get rid of dirty memory quickly with that they probably aren't used anymore (rewrite doesn't happen that often I think), and you've just managed to throw away all free memory, slowing everything down. So basically you're using most of your memory for buffering writes, while the write speed doesn't increase significantly after a certain buffer size.<br>
<p>
What is throttled here is the speed of dirtying pages, not the speed of writeout, to keep the number of dirty pages limited. (But although the dirtying is throttled, the average should in both cases be the write speed of the device, so perhaps "throttling" isn't quite the right word).<br>
<p>
The deadlock mentioned is AFAIK the situation where the system is under heavy memory pressure and wants to free some memory, which it tries to do by writing out dirty pages, but doing that might require allocating some memory, which can't be done because that's what lacking, hence a deadlock. But I don't know if that's the mentioned LVM example, or if that's another case.<br>

<p>
Actually, nothing is throttled here.  Rather, the amount of memory made available for writebehind buffering is restricted, so folks have to wait for it.  Tightening resource availability slows down users of resources, like throttling would, but it's a fundamentally different concept.  Resource restriction pushes back from the actual source of the problem (scarce memory), whereas throttling makes the requester of resource just ask for less, based on some higher level determination that the resource manager would give him too much.
<p>
I think the article is really about smarter memory allocation for writebehind data, not smarter write throttling.
<p>
(To understand the essence of throttling, I think it's good to look at the origin of the word.  It means to choke, as in squeezing a tube (sometimes a person's throat) to reduce flow through it.  The throttle of a classic gas engine prevents the fuel system from delivering fuel to the engine even though the engine is able to burn it).

      What would be good to have is something similar as read ahead, but for writes and opposite: When streaming writing is detected the process should be blocked aggressively so that it has very few dirty pages outstanding, just enough to have near optimal write speed. Such streamed dirty pages could also be moved to the (head of) LRU list to get them quicker out of page cache, after they're written.<br>
<p>
Pity I don't have the time to implement it now. :-(<br>

      Device-level IO blocking doesn't seem granular enough.  Isn't there some <br>
way to manage disk writes with awareness of platters/heads and access <br>
times, so that you essentially gain the performance benefits of RAID?<br>

That would be a much nicer layer to queue IO at.<br>

      I doubt that would make much difference -- the goal is that the rate at which writes are queued should match the rate at which writes are completed.  Since there is a buffer, these rates don't have to match in fine detail; they only have to match on average.<br>
<p>
Even over long time periods, different devices will be more or less fast; but the differences within a device tend (I believe) to wash out over any time period longer than a few hundred milliseconds.<br>

      Man, I just wonder how much write I/O you should have on a modern-day system with let's say 2GB of RAM, so that the dirty cache would cause a significant memory pressure? I mean, before pdflush wakes up and writes them back???<br>
<p>
On my desktop system with 1 GB RAM, apache server with a PHP application for network monitoring that does lots of mysql INSERTs, 2 testing tomcat5 instances, KDE, evolution and firefox running, according to /proc/meminfo, the memory occupied by dirty pages rarely exceed 10MB...<br>

This patch is more about servers than desktops.

This is a server with 1700 MB RAM, and it does quite a bit of IO:

# while true; do grep Dirty /proc/meminfo ; sleep 2s ; done
Dirty:          172404 kB
Dirty:          173100 kB
Dirty:          173332 kB
Dirty:          173260 kB

wouldn't this also be significantly about desktops ?
it seems the grandparent was talking about local disks only, even though article explicitly
mentions other use cases like nfs over gprs :) ).

desktops tend to have all kinds of relatively slow things connected to them - usb drives,
cameras, portable players, all kinds of slow network stuff...
if i understood the idea correctly, these could theoretically block/limit local hdd, which
would otherwise be the fastest device in an average desktop.

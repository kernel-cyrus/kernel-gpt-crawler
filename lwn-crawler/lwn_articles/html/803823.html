Linux systems have traditionally run with a single address space that
is shared by  user and kernel space.  That changed with the advent of the
Meltdown 
vulnerability, which forced the merging of <a
href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> (KPTI) at the end of
2017.  But, Mike Rapoport said during his <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">2019
Open Source Summit Europe</a> 
talk, that may not be the end of the story for address-space isolation.
There is a good case to be made for increasing the separation of address
spaces, but implementing that may require some fundamental changes in how
kernel memory management works.
<p>
Currently, Linux systems still use a single address space, at least when
they are running in kernel mode.  It is efficient and convenient to have
everything visible, but there are security benefits to be had from
splitting the address space apart.  Memory that is not actually mapped is a
lot harder for an attacker to get at.
The first step in that direction was KPTI.  It has performance costs,
especially around transitions between user and kernel space, but there was
no other option that would address the Meltdown problem.  For many, that's
all the address-space isolation they would like to see, but that hasn't
stopped Rapoport from working to expand its use.
<p>
<h4>Beyond KPTI</h4>
<p>
Recently,
he tried to extend this idea with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1556228754-12996-1-git-send-email-rppt@linux.ibm.com/">system-call
address-space isolation</a>, which implemented a restricted address space
for system calls.  When a system call is invoked, most of the
code and data space within the kernel is initially unmapped and
inaccessible; any access to 
that space will generate a page fault.  The kernel can then check to
determine whether it thinks the access is safe; if so, the address in
question is mapped, otherwise the calling process will be killed.
<p>
There are potentially a few use cases for this kind of protection, but the
immediate objective was to defend against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">return-oriented
programming (ROP)</a>
 attacks.  If the target of a jump matches a known

<a href="/Articles/803830/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/osse/MikeRapoport-sm.jpg" alt="[Mike Rapoport]"
title="Mike Rapoport" class="lthumb"></a>

symbol in the kernel, the jump can be considered safe and allowed to
proceed; the page containing that address will be mapped for the duration
of the call.  ROP 
attacks work by jumping into code that is <i>not</i> associated with a
kernel symbol, so most of them would be blocked by this mechanism.  Mapping
the occasional page for safe references will make some code available to
ROP attacks again, but it will still be a fraction of the entire kernel
text (which is available in current kernels).
<p>
These patches have not been merged, though, for a number of reasons.  One is
that nobody really knows how to check data accesses for safety; the
known-symbol test used for text is not applicable to data.  A system call
with invalid parameters can still result in mapping a fair amount of code,
making ROP gadgets available to an attacker.  This patch also slowed
execution considerably, which always makes acceptance harder.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/762570/">L1TF</a> and <a
href="/Articles/788522/">MDS</a> speculative-execution vulnerabilities
bring some challenges of their own.  In particular, they allow a host
system to be attacked from guests, and are thus frightening to cloud
providers.  The defense, for now, is to disable hyperthreading, but that
can have a significant performance cost.  A better solution, Rapoport said,
might be another form of address-space isolation; in this case, it would be
a special kernel mapping used whenever control passes into the kernel from
a guest system.  This "KVM isolation" mechanism was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1557758315-12667-1-git-send-email-alexandre.chartre@oracle.com/">posted
by Alexandre Chartre</a> in May, but has not been merged.
<p>
Other address-space isolation ideas are also circulating.  One of these
would be to map specific kernel data only for the process that needs to
access it.  That would be done by setting up a private range in the kernel
page tables.  Kernel code could allocate memory in this space with new
functions like <tt>kmalloc_proclocal()</tt>.  For extra isolation, memory
allocated in this way would be removed from the kernel's "direct map",
which is a linear mapping of all of the system's physical memory.
Taking pages out of the direct map has its own performance issues, though,
since it requires breaking up huge pages into small pages.


<p>
Then, there are user-exclusive mappings â€” user-space mappings that are only
visible to the owning process.  These could be used to store secrets
(cryptographic keys, for example) in memory where they could not be
(easily) accessed from outside.  Once again, this memory would be removed
from the direct map; it would also not be swappable.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1572171452-7958-1-git-send-email-rppt@kernel.org/"><tt>MAP_EXCLUSIVE</tt></a>
patch series implementing this behavior was posted recently.
<p>
Finally, Rapoport also mentioned namespace-based isolation: kernel memory
that is tied to a specific namespace and which is only visible to
processes running within that namespace.  This turns out to get tricky when
dealing with network
namespaces, though.  The <tt>sk_buff</tt> structures used to represent
packets would be obvious candidates for isolation, but they also often
cross namespace boundaries.
<p>
<h4>Generalizing address-space isolation</h4>
<p>
While each of the address-space isolation mechanisms described above is
different, there are some common factors between all of them.  They are all
concerned with creating a restricted address space from existing memory,
then making this space available when entering the proper execution
context.  So Rapoport is working on an in-kernel API to support
address-space isolation mechanisms in general.  That is going to require
some interesting changes, though.
<p>
The kernel's memory-management code currently assumes that the
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc5/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L365"><tt>mm_struct</tt></a>
structure attached to a process is equivalent to that 
process's page tables, but that connection will need to be broken.  A new
<tt>pg_table</tt> structure will need to be created to represent page
tables; there will also be an associated API to manipulate these page
tables.  A particular challenge will be the creation of a mechanism that
can safely free kernel page tables.
<p>
Creating the restricted contexts is, instead, relatively easy.  Some, like
KPTI, are set up at boot time; others will need to be established at the
right time: process creation, association with a namespace, etc.  The
context-switch code will need to be able to switch between restricted
address spaces; again, switching the kernel's page tables is likely to be
tricky.  There will need to be code to free these restricted address spaces
as well, with appropriate care taken to avoid the inconvenience that would
result from, say, freeing the main kernel page tables.
<p>
Once the infrastructure is in place, the kernel will need to gain support
for private memory allocations.  Functions like <tt>alloc_page()</tt> and
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> will need to gain awareness of the context into which
memory is being allocated; there will be a new <tt>__GFP_EXCLUSIVE</tt>
flag to request an allocation into a restricted context.  Once again, pages
so allocated will need to be removed from the kernel's direct mapping (and
return once they are freed).  Extra care will need to be taken with objects
that need to cross context boundaries.
<p>
Finally, the slab caches will also need to be enhanced to support this
behavior.  Some of the necessary mechanism is already there in the form of
the caching used by the memory controller.  Slab memory is often freed from a
context other than the one in which it was allocated, though, leading to a
number of potential traps.
<p>
Rapoport concluded by stating that address-space isolation needs to be
investigated; it offers a way of significantly reducing the kernel's attack
surface, even in the presence of hardware bugs.  Whether the security
gained this way justifies the extra complexity required to implement it is
something that will have to be evaluated as the patches take shape.  Expect
to see some interesting patches on the mailing lists in the near future as
this work is developed.

1) only if you don't care about the power used by the decoder, it sure has not helped Intel compete against ARM in embedded CPUs..<br>
<p>
2) ISA still matter: from memory, going from x86 to x86-64 allowed a 10% improvement in benchmarks..<br>

Is ARM more RISCy than x86 nowadays? They both have complex instruction decoders because the instruction set doesn't match their high-performance internal architecture. E.g. some ARMs have instruction fusion for sequences like mov+movk (loading a 32-bit immediate), adrp+ldr (PC-relative load), cmp+branch, etc, then instructions get broken down again into micro-ops for execution, in a similar way to x86. The compiler-facing instruction set on ARM is more RISC-like than x86 but that seems largely irrelevant to the CPU's performance; the instruction set on both is essentially just a poorly-designed compression format for micro-ops.<br>

(There is no 64-bit version of Thumb, although ARMv8-A CPUs still support 32-bit Thumb and non-Thumb encodings so it's not saving any complexity. I guess they figured that nobody cares that much about code density outside of M-series CPUs, and those people can carry on using ARMv8-M which is 32-bit-only and Thumb-only.)<br>

Yes, Arm is more RISCy than x86 in the sense that it doesn't have LESS instructions but every instruction has less scope. RISC was never about reducing the number of possible combinations of opcodes, but to make sure that each 'instruction' was orthogonal up to the point that it remained useful. x86 has ADDs which can sign extend, load or store memory, AND NOT combined, and so on.<br>
<p>
RISC decouples those so that if you have a need to do AND, NOT and ANDN, then you don't actually need a special instruction that can ANDN, you don't need memory operands for arithmetic if you have LDR and STR. Yes, it takes more instructions to do the same job, but in the end not a larger amount of time -- there isn't much of a case for LDR+LDR+ADD+STR taking any longer than MOV+ADD to actually execute.<br>
<p>
Where Arm is less RISCy than academic RISC is the flexible second operand (i.e. you can shift and sign/zero extend inputs) which is definitely a convenience for code density. I don't think there was any consideration for 'complex decode logic' in Arm, the point was to take advantage of registers and being able to compartmentalize your memory accesses (because memory bandwidth is always bad).<br>

In '90, the Acorn archimedes (one of the first arm processor that I remember) was a lot faster than the 386 (in terms of 1:2 and more). At the time the ARM was a younger processor than the x86 so the expectation was bright future for this kind of CPU. In fact after these years, every new CPU was a RISC one.<br>
<p>
Now the ARM has yes a batter ratio power/watt; but the absolute maximum power of an ARM cpu is lesser or at most equal to an x86.<br>
<p>
The x86 technology has evolved at the point that the decoder is not more the bottleneck. So the ISA doesn't matter anymore.<br>

BTW, I have recently learned that human (natural) languages have a deep parallel to the CISC/RISC split. Some have simple syllabes that can be pronounced quickly, others have complex syllabes that take more time to articulate. But the end result is that when you measure information content over time, all languages have basically the same throughput of around 40 bps. So perhaps this is also what happened with RISC: yes, you could execute instructions faster, but this was completely offset by the fact that you needed more of them to do the same thing.<br>
<p>
I wonder if the languages with complex syllables are also just fronts for a language with much simpler syllabes underneath, though ;)<br>

      My impression is that a big part of what happened was that the RISC vs CISC battle took place when raw computing power was the main limit on how fast a computer could accomplish things, so there was a serious issue of whether it was better to have many small operations with high clock speed or fewer bigger operations with a slower clock speed.  But what's happened since then is that processors have outstripped the rest of the system to the point that instruction set complexity is no longer where the action is.  Instead, the limit on the computer is how fast and efficiently you can get instructions and data to it.  That means the big battle is now things like how big your cache is and how cleverly you use it, how you can minimize RAM latency, and whether you can avoid backtracking in a deep pipeline by using speculative execution.

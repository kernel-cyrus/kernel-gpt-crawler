<p>
The process of hardening the kernel can benefit in a number of ways from
support by the compiler. In recent years, the <a
href="/Articles/698827/">Kernel Self Protection Project</a> has brought
this support from the <a href="https://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity</a>/PaX
patch set into the kernel in the 

form of <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/gcc-plugins.html">GCC
plugins</a>; LWN looked into that process <a href="/Articles/712161/">back
in 2017</a>.  A recent discussion has highlighted the fact that the use of
GCC plugins brings disadvantages 
as well, and some developers would prefer to see those plugins replaced.

<p>The discussion started when Josh Poimboeuf <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/efe6b039a544da8215d5e54aa7c4b6d1986fc2b0.1611607264.git.jpoimboe@redhat.com/">reported
an issue</a> he encountered when building out-of-tree modules with GCC
plugins enabled. In his case, the compilation would fail when the GCC version
used to compile the module was even slightly different from the one used to
build the kernel. He included a patch to change the error he received into
a warning and disable the affected plugin. Later in the
thread, Justin Forbes <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAFbkSA0m1pqmXh29j6wJ9fG05yC72T1kNC0QU3rF7Oh2NoMwYQ@mail.gmail.com/">explained</a>
how the problematic configuration came about; it happens within the Fedora
continuous-integration system, which starts by building a current
toolchain snapshot. Other jobs then compile out-of-tree modules with the
new toolchain, without recompiling the kernel itself. Since GCC
plugins were enabled, all jobs with out-of-tree modules have been
failing.</p>

<p>The idea of changing the error into a warning was met with a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNAS=uOi=8xJU=NiKnXQW2iCazbErg_TX0gL9oayBiDffiA@mail.gmail.com/">negative
response</a> from the kernel build-system maintainer, Masahiro Yamada, who
stated: "<q>We are based on the assumption that we use the same compiler
for in-tree and out-of-tree</q>". Poimboeuf <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210125212755.jfwlqogpcarmxdgt@treble/">responded</a>
that what he sees in real-world configurations doesn't match that
assumption. Other kernel developers agreed with Yamada,
though; Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/YBAuddhlne9Dz/7M@kroah.com/">wrote</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Have you not noticed include/linux/compiler.h and all of the
	different changes/workarounds we do for different versions of
	gcc/clang/intel compilers?  We have never guaranteed that a kernel
	module would work that was built with a different compiler than the
	main kernel, and I doubt we can start now.
</blockquote></p>

<p>In addition, Yamada <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNASOf=B_j5o=L=BL+vz_JK_d3QYUuHg8h+3SP6qOyYD86A@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a> that the use of the same compiler version for both the kernel and
its modules has been accepted as an assumption in previous discussions.
With clear disapproval from the kernel developers, the
discussion seemed closed at that point.</p>

<h4>The dislike for GCC plugins</h4>

<p>It restarted, however, when Poimboeuf <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210302232649.y2tutffhxsblwqlb@treble/">came
back</a> a few days later with another idea for solving his problem:
recompiling all plugins when the GCC version changes. This was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNAReuB5zUq_7S8ZG25+tdQowECDOK1rApYvkPCpHhPjK5w@mail.gmail.com/">refused</a>
by Yamada, who noted that Ubuntu does not have the GCC mismatch
problem, so the problem seemed to be specific to Fedora. Linus
Torvalds also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjR0CyaKU=6mXW9W+65L8h8DQuBdA2ZY2CfrPe6qurz3A@mail.gmail.com/">disagreed</a>
with the proposal, but for another reason. For him there is no technical
reason to recompile everything when the GCC version changes, but he expressed
his concern on the usage and design of the GCC plugins in general. In a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whA6zru0BaNm4uu5KyZe+aQpRScOnmc9hdOpO3W+xN9Xw@mail.gmail.com/">followup
message</a> he explained his reasoning in strong words:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The kernel gcc plugins _will_ go away eventually. They are an
	unmitigated disaster. They always have been. I'm sorry I ever
	merged that support. It's not only a maintenance nightmare, it's
	just a horrible thing and interface in the first place. It's
	literally BAD TECHNOLOGY.
</blockquote>

<p>For Torvalds, the right way to implement such plugins is at the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate
representation</a> (IR) level, but GCC plugins were designed
differently for non-technical reasons (out of fear for non-free
plugins, which LWN <a href="/Articles/301135/">covered</a> back in 
2008). People who are interested in plugins should 
use Clang, as it has a clean IR and easily allows adding
similar checks at the IR level, he said.</p>

<h4>GCC plugins and their Clang equivalents</h4>

<p>However, the removal of the kernel's GCC plugins does not seem likely in the
near future. Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202103031334.8D898CA@keescook/">commented on</a> the
current status of the GCC plugins, their Clang equivalents, and why there
is a user community for at least some of them.  A number of the
capabilities provided by the GCC plugins are not yet available with Clang ‚Äî
which many distributors are not using to build the kernel anyway.
<p>
Currently the kernel supports the following plugins (located in
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.10/source/scripts/gcc-plugins"><tt>scripts/gcc-plugins/</tt></a>):</p> 

<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>cyc_complexity</b> computes the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic
     complexity</a> of a function; it is one of the two initial example
     plugins, and likely has no users.

<li> <b>latent_entropy</b> adds entropy from the CPU execution. Cook sees no
    uses of it, especially since the addition of the the <a
    href="/Articles/642166/">jitter entropy</a> mechanism. There is no
    Clang support planned.

<li> The <b>per-task stack protector for arm32</b> provides
     stack protection for 32-bit ARM platforms; no Clang equivalent exists
     today even for 64-bit systems, Cook said.

<li> <b>randstruct</b> randomly changes the order of fields in kernel data
     structures that contain only function pointers, or are explicitly
     marked with <tt>__randomize_layout</tt>. There are two versions of
     this plugin: one complete and one restricted.  The restricted version
     only changes the order of elements contained within the same cache line,
     which reduces the performance cost, but also the protection level. A
     Clang version <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D59254">was
     submitted</a>, but is stalled.  Cook noted that security-conscious end
     users tend to enable this plugin, but distributors do not.

<li> <b>sancov</b> (which Cook didn't mention) helps fuzzing coverage by
     inserting a call to <a
     href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.10/source/kernel/kcov.c#L189"><tt>__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc()</tt></a>
     at the start of each basic block; it is used to determine which code
     blocks are being exercised.

<li> <b>stackleak</b> traces the kernel's stack depth so that it can
     overwrite the used stack with a pattern when returning to user
     space. There is no Clang support planned for now.

<li> <b>structleak</b> initializes structures that could be passed to user
     space.  Clang has it implemented as the
     <tt>-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero</tt> option; GCC is likely to gain
     support for that option as well at some point.
</ul>

<p>
The end result is that there is probably a reason to keep these plugins
around for a while yet.
<p>
Meanwhile, there were a couple of positive outcomes from the discussion.
Along the way, it was realized that the plugins, which are highly sensitive
to the GCC version they were built for, were not being rebuilt when that
version changes.  That had evidently been the case since the plugins were
first added; that problem <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/Makefile?h=v5.12-rc4&id=ce6ed1c4c9876c2880f52f18c41ef2a30d070bc5">was
fixed</a> by Yamada, despite his rejection of this idea earlier in the discussion.
As a solution for Poimboeuf's original problem, the developers <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNARHoTnZ3gAvHgnYB4n-wYuboxC10A6zURh1ODGhxWd2yA@mail.gmail.com/">finally
agreed</a> to show a warning when there is a GCC version mismatch between
the kernel and modules. It will be up to the user to decide if the
difference is minor and safe, or if it is necessary to recompile the
kernel.</p>

<p>The problem of the GCC version mismatch was not the only one noticed by
Poimboeuf; he also <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210125212755.jfwlqogpcarmxdgt@treble/">pointed
out </a> the plugin build-system's dependency on the (optional) <tt>gcc-plugin-devel</tt>
package. Even if the user has the same GCC version as used for the kernel
compilation, but they do not have this package, plugins will be
silently disabled, though the kernel compilation will succeed without any warning. This
problem has not been addressed further.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>The discussion covered a number of problems with the GCC plugins.  It
likely means that developers should be careful when enabling them.
Poimboeuf's original problem got a solution of sorts in the form of a
warning, which might start showing up in some systems. Users might be able to ignore the
warning if the two GCC versions are close. When enabling plugins, developers
should be careful to install <tt>gcc-plugin-devel</tt> first, otherwise
their modules may be compiled in an unexpected way.</p>

<p>The future of GCC plugins in the kernel is not set in stone yet.
Clang seems to be a preferred option for the hardening work, and this
direction has been
encouraged by Torvalds, but the existing GCC plugins (with one
exception) do not have Clang equivalents. It seems that they
will stay for at least some time.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

FWIW I think some of these can simply be implemented in both compilers proper rather than plugins. They just require careful thought to at least try to make them not too specific to the Linux kernel codebase.  I plan to look into implementing some of the these in Clang proper soon (and not as plugins, but -f flags perhaps).<br>

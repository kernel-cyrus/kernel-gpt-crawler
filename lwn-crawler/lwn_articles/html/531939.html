           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>January 9, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> Checkpoint/restore is a mechanism that permits taking a snapshot of the
state of an application (which may consist of multiple processes) and then
later restoring the application to a running state. One use of
checkpoint/restore is for live migration, which allows a running
application to be moved between host systems without loss of
service. Another use is incremental snapshotting, whereby periodic
snapshots are made of a long-running application so that it can be
restarted from a recent snapshot in the event of a system outage, thus
avoiding the loss of days of calculation. There are also many other uses
for the feature.

<p> Checkpoint/restore has a long history, which <a
href="/Articles/525675/">we covered</a> in November. The initial approach,
starting in 2005, was to provide a kernel-space implementation. However,
the patches implementing this approach were ultimately rejected as being
too complex, invasive, and difficult to maintain. This led to an alternate approach: 
checkpoint/restore in user space (CRIU), an implementation that performs
most of the work in user space, with some support from the kernel. The
benefit of the CRIU approach is that, by comparison with a kernel-space
implementation, it requires fewer and less invasive changes in the kernel
code.

<p> To correctly handle the widest possible range of applications, CRIU
needs to be able to checkpoint and restore as much of a process's state as
possible. This is a large task, since there are very many pieces of process
state that need to be handled, including process ID, parent process ID,
credentials, current working directory, resource limits, timers, open file
descriptors, and so on. Furthermore, some resources may be shared across
multiple processes (for example, multiple processes may hold open file
descriptors referring to the same open file), so that successfully
restoring application state also requires reproducing shared aspects of
process state.

<p> For each piece of process state, CRIU requires two pieces of support
from the kernel: a mechanism for retrieving the state (used during
checkpoint) and a mechanism to set the state (used during restore). In some
cases, the kernel provides most or all of the necessary support.  In other
cases, however, the kernel does not provide a mechanism to retrieve the
(complete) value of the state during a checkpoint or does not provide a
mechanism to set the state during restore. Thus, one of the ongoing pieces
of work for the implementation of CRIU is to add support to the kernel for
these missing pieces.

<p>Andrey Vagin's recent patches to the <tt>signalfd()</tt> system call are
an example of this ongoing work and illustrate the complexity of the task of
saving and restoring process state. Before looking at these patches
closely, we need to consider the general problem that CRIU is trying to
solve with respect to signals, and consider some of the details that make
the solution complicated.



<h4>The problem and its complexities</h4>

<p> The overall problem that the CRIU developers want to solve is
checkpointing and restoring a process's set of pending signals&mdash;the
set of signals that have been queued for delivery to the process but not
yet delivered. The idea is that when a process is checkpointed, all of the
process's pending signals should be fetched and saved, and when the process
is restored, all of the signals should be requeued to the process.  As
things stand, the kernel does not quite provide sufficient support for CRIU
to perform either of these tasks.


<p> At first glance, it might seem that the task is as simple as fetching
the list of pending signal numbers during a checkpoint and then requeueing
those signals during the restore. However, there's rather more to the story
than that. First, each signal has an associated <tt>siginfo</tt> structure
that provides additional information about the signal. That information is
available when a process receives a signal. If a signal handler is
installed using <tt>sigaction()</tt> with the <tt>SA_SIGINFO</tt> flag,
then the additional information is available as the second argument of the
signal handler, which is prototyped as:

<pre>
    void handler(int sig, siginfo_t *siginfo, void *ucontext);
</pre>

<p> The <tt>siginfo</tt> structure contains a number of fields. One of
these, <tt>si_code</tt>, provides further information about the origin of
the signal.  A positive number in this field indicates that the signal was
generated by the kernel; a negative number indicates that the signal was
generated by user space (typically by a library function such as
<tt>sigqueue()</tt>). For example, if the signal was generated because of the
expiration of a POSIX timer, then <tt>si_code</tt> will be set to the value
<tt>SI_TIMER</tt>.  On the other hand, if a <tt>SIGCHLD</tt> signal was
delivered because a child process changed state, then <tt>si_code</tt> is
set to one of a range of values indicating that the process terminated, was
killed by a signal, was stopped, and so on.

<p> Other <tt>siginfo</tt> fields provide further information about the
signal. For example, if the signal was sent using the <tt>kill()</tt>
system call, then the <tt>si_pid</tt> field contains the PID and the
<tt>si_uid</tt> field contains the real user ID of the sending
process. Various other fields in the <tt>siginfo</tt> structure provide
information about specific signals.

<p> There are other factors that make checkpoint/restore of signals
complicated. One of these is that multiple instances of the so-called
real-time signals can be queued. This means that the CRIU mechanism must
ensure that all of the queued signals are gathered up during a checkpoint.

<p> One final detail about signals must also be handled by CRIU. Signals
can be queued either to a specific thread or to a process as a whole
(meaning that the signal can be delivered to any of the threads in the
process). CRIU needs a mechanism to distinguish these two queues during a
checkpoint operation, so that it can later restore them.



<h4>Limitations of the existing system call API</h4>

<p> At first glance it might seem that the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html"><tt>signalfd()</tt></a>
system call could solve the problem of gathering all pending signals during
a CRIU checkpoint:

<pre>
    int signalfd(int fd, const sigset_t *mask, int flags);
</pre>

<p> This system call creates a file descriptor from which signals can be
"read." Reads from the file descriptor return <tt>signalfd_siginfo</tt>
structures containing much of the same information that is passed in the
<tt>siginfo</tt> argument of a signal handler.

<p> However, it turns out that using <tt>signalfd()</tt> to read all
pending signals in preparation for a checkpoint has a couple of
limitations.  The first of these is that <tt>signalfd()</tt> is unaware of
the distinction between thread-specific and process-wide signals: it simply
returns all pending signals, intermingling those that are process-wide with
those that are directed to the calling thread. Thus, <tt>signalfd()</tt>
loses information that is required for a CRIU restore operation.

<p> A second limitation is less obvious but just as important. As we noted
above, the <tt>siginfo</tt> structure contains many fields. However, only
some of those fields are filled in for each signal. (Similar statements
hold true of the <tt>signalfd_siginfo</tt> structure used by
<tt>signalfd()</tt>.)  To simplify the task of deciding which fields need
to be copied to user space when a kernel-generated signal is delivered (or read via a
<tt>signalfd()</tt> file descriptor), the kernel encodes a value in the
two most significant bytes of the <tt>si_code</tt> field.  The kernel then
elsewhere uses a <tt>switch</tt> statement based on this value to select
the code that copies values from appropriate fields in the kernel-internal
<tt>siginfo</tt> structure to the user-space <tt>siginfo</tt>
structure. For example, for signals generated by POSIX timers, the kernel
encodes the value <tt>__SI_TIMER</tt> in the high bytes of <tt>si_code</tt>,
which indicates that various timer-related fields must be copied to the
user-space <tt>siginfo</tt> structure.

<p> Encoding a value in the high bytes of the kernel-internal
<tt>siginfo.si_code</tt> field serves the kernel's requirements when it
comes to implementing signal handlers and <tt>signalfd()</tt>. However, one
piece of information is <i>not</i> copied to user space. For
kernel-generated signals (i.e., those signals with a positive
<tt>si_code</tt> value), the value encoded in the high bytes of the
<tt>si_code</tt> field is discarded before that field is copied to user
space, and it is not possible for CRIU to unambiguously reconstruct the
discarded value based only on the signal number and the remaining bits that
are passed in the <tt>si_code</tt> field.  This means that CRIU can't
determine which other fields in the <tt>siginfo</tt> structure are valid;
in other words, information that is essential to perform a restore of
pending signals has been lost.

<p> A related limitation in the system call API affects CRIU restore.  The
obvious candidates for restoring pending signals are two low-level system
calls, <tt>rt_sigqueueinfo()</tt> and <tt>rt_tgsigqueueinfo()</tt>, which
queue signals for a process and a thread, respectively.  These system calls
are normally rarely used outside of the C library (where, for example, they
are used to implement the <tt>sigqueue()</tt> and
<tt>pthread_sigqueue()</tt> library functions). Aside from the thread-versus-process difference, these two system calls are quite similar. For example, 
<tt>rt_sigqueueinfo()</tt> has the following prototype:

<pre>
    int rt_sigqueueinfo(pid_t tgid, int sig, siginfo_t *siginfo);
</pre>

<p> The system call sends the signal <tt>sig</tt>, whose attributes are
provided in <tt>siginfo</tt>, to the process with the ID
<tt>tgid</tt>. This seems perfect, except that the kernel imposes one
limitation: <tt>siginfo.si_code</tt> must be less than 0. (This restriction
exists to prevent a process from spoofing as the kernel when sending
signals to other processes.) This means that even if we could use
<tt>signalfd()</tt> to retrieve the two most significant bytes of
<tt>si_code</tt>, we could not use <tt>rt_sigqueueinfo()</tt> to restore
those bytes during a CRIU restore.
 


<h4>Progress towards a solution</h4>

Andrey's <a href="/Articles/530773/">first attempt</a> to add support for
checkpoint/restore of pending signals took the form of an extension that
added three new flags to the <tt>signalfd()</tt> system call.  The first of
these flags, <tt>SFD_RAW</tt>, changed the behavior of subsequent reads
from the signalfd file descriptor: instead of returning a
<tt>signalfd_siginfo</tt> structure, reads returned a "raw"
<tt>siginfo</tt> structure that contains some information not returned via
<tt>signalfd_siginfo</tt> and whose <tt>si_code</tt> field includes the two
most significant bytes. The other flags, <tt>SFD_PRIVATE</tt> and
<tt>SFD_GROUP</tt>, controlled whether reads should return signals from the
per-thread queue or the process-wide queue.

<p> One other piece of the patch set relaxed the restrictions in
<tt>rt_sigqueueinfo()</tt> and <tt>rt_tgsigqueueinfo()</tt> so that a
positive value can be specified in <tt>si_code</tt>, so long as the caller
is sending a signal to itself. (It seems safe to allow a process to spoof as
the kernel when sending signals to itself.)

<p> A <a href="/Articles/532105/">discussion</a> on the design of the interface
ensued between Andrey and Oleg Nesterov. Andrey noted that, for backward
compatibility reasons, the <tt>signalfd_siginfo</tt> structure could not be fixed to
supply the information required by CRIU, so a new message format really was
required. Oleg noted that nondestructive reads that employed a positional
interface (i.e., the ability to read message N from the queue) would
probably be preferable.

<p>
In response to Oleg's feedback, Andrey has now produced a  <a
href="/Articles/531942/">second version</a> of his patches with a
revised API. The <tt>SFD_RAW</tt> flag and the use of a "raw"
<tt>siginfo</tt> structure remain, as do the changes to 
<tt>rt_sigqueueinfo()</tt> and <tt>rt_tgsigqueueinfo()</tt>. However, the
new patch set provides a rather different interface for reading signals,
via the <tt>pread()</tt> system call:

<pre>
    ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
</pre>

In normal use, <tt>pread()</tt> reads <tt>count</tt> bytes from the file
referred to by the descriptor <tt>fd</tt>, starting at byte <tt>offset</tt> in
the file. Andrey's patch repurposes the interface somewhat in order to read
from signalfd file descriptors: <tt>offset</tt> is used to both select
which queue to read from and to specify an ordinal position in that
queue. The caller calculates the <tt>offset</tt> argument using the formula

<pre>
    queue + pos
</pre>

<tt>queue</tt> is either <tt>SFD_SHARED_QUEUE_OFFSET</tt> to read from the
process-wide signal queue, or <tt>SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE_OFFSET</tt> to read
from the per-thread signal queue. <tt>pos</tt> specifies an ordinal
position (not a byte offset) in the queue; the first signal in the queue is
at position 0. For example, the following call reads the fourth signal in
the process-wide signal queue:

<pre>
    n = pread(fs, &amp;buf, sizeof(buf), SFD_SHARED_QUEUE_OFFSET + 3);
</pre>

<p> 
If there is no signal at position <tt>pos</tt> (i.e., an attempt was made to
read past the end of the queue), <tt>pread()</tt> returns zero.

<p> Using <tt>pread()</tt> to read signals from a signalfd file descriptor
is nondestructive: the signal remains in the queue to be read again if
desired.

<p> Andrey's second round of patches has so far received little
comment. Although Oleg proposed the revised API, <a
href="/Articles/532138/">he is unsure</a> whether it will pass muster with
Linus:

<div class="BigQuote">

I think we should cc Linus.

<p> This patch adds the hack and it makes signalfd even more strange.

<p> Yes, this hack was suggested by me because I can't suggest something
better. But if Linus dislikes this user-visible API it would be better to
get his nack right now.

</div>


<p>
To date, however, a version of the patches that copies Linus does not 
seem to have gone out. In the meantime, Andrey's work serves as a good
example of the complexities involved in getting CRIU to successfully handle
checkpoint and restore of each piece of process state. And one way or
another, checkpoint/restore of pending signals seems like a useful enough
feature that it will make it into the kernel in some form, though possibly with a
better API.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I don't think that can realistically be considered an issue. Libraries are already entirely at the mercy of the process they're linked into, sharing RAM, signals, file descriptors, stack space, etc. There is no point in defining security boundaries between code modules which have been linked into the same executable and run in the same address space.<br>

Just a gut feeling about this. It seems weird to abuse pread to handle signal issues. Is it better to just add (yet) another API instead of abusing pread? I don't know... But it is surprising that suddenly pread can read from a signal fd, and even more surprising that pwrite cannot write to it...<br>

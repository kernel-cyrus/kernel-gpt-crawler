Brendan Jackman has been working to try to get ahead of the next hardware CPU
vulnerability
before it gets discovered. In January, he posted the second version of
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250110-asi-rfc-v2-v2-0-8419288bc805@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that introduces
<a href="/Articles/974390/">
address-space isolation</a> (ASI) as a way of
preventing future CPU vulnerabilities from leaking important
information. The core concept is to ensure that data that is not currently
needed is not present in memory, so that speculative execution cannot leak it.
The work is nowhere near ready to be incorporated into the mainline
kernel — not least of all because it has a large performance impact in its
current form — but it is likely to once again be a topic of discussion at the
2025
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">
Linux Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.
</p>

<p>
Jackman's patch set introduces different classes of memory. The classes are
effectively isolated from one another, in order to avoid leaking information
between them.
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240712-asi-rfc-24-v1-0-144b319a40d8@google.com/">
The first version</a> only differentiated between memory
mappings for KVM virtual machines and everything else, but reviewers wanted a
demonstration that his approach could handle more than just two classes.
Therefore, the most recent version of the patch set has a separate class for
kernel code that handles certain system calls that don't require access to
sensitive data as well. Each class
of memory has its own independent address space, intended to contain only
information relevant to a particular part of the system.
When the kernel needs to access user-space
memory, or run code for a virtual machine, it needs to switch to using that
class (and that address space).
Speculative execution cannot leak information
that is not mapped into memory, and
the system keeps track of
switches between classes in order to flush any other microarchitectural state that could
be used to leak information.
</p>

<p>
If this idea sounds similar to
<a href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> (KPTI), that's because it
is. KPTI ensures that kernel and user space have almost entirely separate address
spaces, with separate page tables. This prevents user-space code from using
speculative execution to leak memory from the kernel. ASI is essentially taking
the idea one step further, by carving up the kernel into (for now) separate sections for
KVM operations, the parts needed for responding to certain non-sensitive system calls, and everything
else. Somewhat confusingly, the patch set calls the address space for responding to system calls
that don't need sensitive information the user-space ASI class, even though it
is used in the kernel, not in user space.
</p>

<p>
Jackman's patch set
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250110-asi-rfc-v2-v2-3-8419288bc805@google.com/">
does not interfere</a> with KPTI; systems where both KPTI and ASI run together
will currently end up with four separate address spaces per task: the unrestricted kernel
address space, the user address space (added by KPTI), and one restricted kernel
address space for each ASI class (KVM and ASI's user-space class). There are
some fundamental drawbacks to this proliferation of address spaces, however.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, this design would make it trivial to respond to the next discovered CPU
vulnerability;
in the most likely case of another
speculative-execution-based vulnerability,
the kernel would already be protected. If some other way of leaking information
with CPU state is discovered, kernel developers would just have to make
sure that the relevant CPU state was included in the list of things to flush
when changing classes.
That list currently includes the translation lookaside
buffer, the level 1 CPU cache, and branch-predictor state.
Leaking information within a class are not a concern, because
the idea is to only put the minimum necessary information in each class, so code
running in an address space should already have access to it anyway.
</p>

<p>
As ever, the problem is performance. The
impact of the patches varies greatly between different workloads, but the greatest impact that
Jackman observed during testing was a 70% reduction in throughput on a particular
disk I/O benchmark. Because each class of memory needs to have its own, separate
set of mapped pages, the patch set removes the page cache from the
kernel's direct map. File operations — which almost always need to touch the page
cache — require changing ASI class for each operation, which is slow.
Theoretically, such a change
isn't necessary, if non-sensitive parts of the page cache can be added to the
relevant ASI class. This is one of several potential improvements that Jackson
called out in his commit messages. He hopes to implement them in the future, but
right now, he's focused on
validating the approach and seeing whether the kernel development community
would support implementing it.
</p>

<p>
Borislav Petkov
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250219105503.GKZ7W4h6QW1CNj48U9@fat_crate.local/">
thought</a> that Jackman's patch set presented a "<q>weird API</q>". It
adds three different functions that parts of the kernel can use to
manipulate the current ASI class: <tt>asi_enter()</tt>, which enters a
restricted class; <tt>asi_relax()</tt>, which signals the end of untrusted code;
and <tt>asi_exit()</tt>, which does the actual work of exiting a restricted
class. Petkov thought the naming was unintuitive — calls to <tt>asi_enter()</tt>
don't necessarily match one-to-one with calls to <tt>asi_exit()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The design, Jackman
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CA+i-1C3Ei=dNRUaHThaBr3hPy8=5O+ocRHgw=YLkX6goJWw4ow@mail.gmail.com/">
said</a>, was something of a holdover from when he had only implemented support
for KVM. Calls to <tt>asi_enter()</tt> are actually balanced with calls to
<tt>asi_relax()</tt>, as he explained with this pseudocode description of that
support:
</p>

<pre>
    ioctl(KVM_RUN) {
        enter_from_user_mode();
        while !need_userspace_handling() {
            asi_enter();
            vmenter();
            asi_relax();
        }
        asi_exit();
        exit_to_user_mode();
    }
</pre>

<p>
Since <tt>asi_exit()</tt> does the expensive work of leaving a restricted ASI
class, arranging the API so that the kernel needs to call it as little as
possible is necessary for performance. Petkov
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250227120607.GPZ8BVL2762we1j3uE@fat_crate.local/">
thought</a> it would make more sense to ensure that the functions that need to
be balanced with each other have corresponding names, and suggested renaming
<tt>asi_exit()</tt> to <tt>asi_switch()</tt> and <tt>asi_relax()</tt> to
<tt>asi_exit()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Jackman was
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250228084355.2061899-1-jackmanb@google.com/">
receptive</a> to the criticism, but pointed out that there were other
complications: eventually, he would like to completely remove <tt>asi_exit()</tt>,
and have the kernel automatically switch ASI classes when a need is detected at
run time. This could potentially be another way to avoid unnecessary ASI class
switches, for better performance. So any API design should make it easy to
eventually do away with whatever equivalent of <tt>asi_exit()</tt> the kernel
developers end up committing to. Also, the API needs to ensure that there's no
period during which an interrupt can arrive and accidentally return to code that
should run in a restricted ASI class without applying the restriction.
</p>

<p>
The second concern
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250314131419.GJZ9Qrq8scAtDyBUcg@fat_crate.local/">
didn't make sense</a> to Petkov, but Junaid Shahid
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/5aa114f7-3efb-4dab-8579-cb9af4abd3c0@google.com/">
shared</a> a simpler example that
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250315123621.GCZ9V0RWGFapbQNL1w@fat_crate.local/">
made it click</a>. Petkov suggested an API that separates out the operation of
telling interrupt handlers that they may need to worry about returning to a
restricted address space, actually switching to that space, and tracking whether
the CPU was currently executing restricted code.
</p>

<p>
Jackman
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9gKLdNm9p6qGACS@google.com/">didn't see</a> why
updating interrupt handlers and switching address spaces needed to be separate
operations, and proposed using functions called <tt>asi_start()</tt>/<tt>asi_end()</tt> to
handle those and functions called
<tt>asi_start_critical()</tt>/<tt>asi_end_critical()</tt> to demarcate untrusted code.
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/14f9106d-3a34-4f10-ba4e-465c73c94eba@google.com/">
Shahid</a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250319152334.GLZ9rhdrBYW2yXRbY3@fat_crate.local/">
Petkov</a> were generally happy with that design.
</p>

<p>
At the time of writing, the review and discussion are ongoing. While Jackman's
updated patches seem to demonstrate that ASI could flexibly handle multiple
different classes of memory, there are still a lot of questions that need to be
answered before the work will be ready. Getting ahead of hardware
vulnerabilities with a generic protection like the one Jackman proposes is a
daunting task, but a worthy one. It remains to be seen whether other kernel
developers will agree with this approach.

      Can somebody remind me why it's not good enough to switch the ASID (address space ID, called PCID by Intel), and the whole TLB has to be flushed?

<p>Intel and AMD have learned about Spectre in June 2017, and since then, designed completely new CPU cores (e.g., Zen5), but they have not fixed Spectre.  Fixes such as invisible speculation have been proposed since shortly after the bugs became public knowledge in January 2018, but they have not been implemented in hardware.  My impression is that the public demand for such fixes is too small, because many people think that Spectre does not affect them (supposedly only the cloud) and because they think that such fixes cost too much performance (papers typically indicate a few percent of slowdown, some more, some even a speedup).

<p>However, thanks to the lack of hardware fixes we get software mitigation after software mitigation, each costing performance as well as adding complexity that makes it harder to add further improvements to the software, including performance improvements.  The end result is that we get slowdowns (probably higher ones than from the hardware fixes), but only a limited amount of security against Spectre: Not all software implements the mitigations, and software that implements them often has bugs that leave holes in the mitigations.

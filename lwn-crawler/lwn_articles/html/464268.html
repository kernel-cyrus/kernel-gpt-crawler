<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2011/">2011 Kernel Summit</a> coverage
</div>
Google's David Sharp made an appearance at the 2011 Kernel Summit to talk
about his employer's tracing needs.  Linux generally works well for Google,
but there will always be cases where things go wrong or take too long.  As
a part of its effort to track down the sources of the "last 0.1%" of
performance problems, Google makes heavy use of the kernel's tracing
features.
<p>
Traced kernel events go through the kernel's ring buffer on their way to
user space.  For Google's purposes, the more data that can be fit into that
buffer, the better.  There is only so much memory that can be dedicated to
that task; it needs to be able to hold data for as long a period as

<a href="/Articles/464311/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lc-europe/DavidSharp-sm.jpg" width=125 height=151
alt="[David Sharp]" border=0 align="right" hspace=2 vspace=2></a>

possible.  That memory cannot be increased, and the frequency of traced
events cannot be decreased; that means that the only way to increase the
capacity of the ring buffer is to reduce the size of the recorded events.
<p>
David put up a plot showing the results of the work they have done.  With
their configured buffer size, a mainline kernel can hold about 10s worth of
data.  Taking some unnecessary fields out of the event header - things like
the preemption count and lock depth - increases it to 12s.  A much bigger
gain can be had by removing the arguments to system calls, leaving only the
lowest 16&nbsp;bits of the first argument; that increases the duration to
32s.  Finally, if the process ID is also removed, the buffer can hold 45s
worth of data.  That makes it far more useful for Google's purposes.
<p>
It would be nice to be able to make such changes without hacking the
kernel, but messing with the event format will clearly cause problems with
the applications that consume those events.  There are other things that
Google would like; one of those is the ability to dynamically size the ring
buffer on each CPU.  In normal operation, some CPUs will fill their buffers
more quickly than others; moving memory from the slower CPUs to the faster
ones would, again, increase the duration for the whole system.

Some sort of always-on "flight recorder" mode of tracing would also be
useful; the data could then be grabbed when something goes wrong.
<p>
Google does not limit itself to tracing kernel events; there is
infrastructure to trace user space and remote procedure calls as well.
That leads to the thorny problem of stitching the separate trace streams
together, especially when they involve multiple machines.  Those machines
will never have 100% synchronized clocks, so lining up the trace streams
can be a challenge.
<p>
There are patches for some of the changes that have been made.  But Linus
worried that most heavy tracing users have specialized tools.  The kernel
sometimes gets the tracing changes, but the tools don't show up; in the
absence of those tools, Linus is a lot less interested in the patches.  So,
he asked of tracing users in general: please make your tools available to
others.  David said that Google is open to the idea, but actually getting
the tools pushed out into an open source release is hard.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/464320/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lc-europe/IngoMolnar-sm.jpg" alt="[Ingo Molnar]"
border=0 align="right" hspace=2 vspace=2></a>

Ingo Molnar talked about how tracing events tend to expose kernel
internals; that can lead to ABI constraints as tools come to depend on
those internals.  The solution, according to Ingo, is to move the tools
closer to the source of the events; in this case, that means putting the
tools into the kernel source tree.  The tooling, he said, is even more
important than the kernel side of things.

Peter Zijlstra joined in to say that it is a shame that we allow tools
outside of the kernel at all.  That leads to ABI preservation needs, with
the result that tracepoints are telling lies to user space in response.
There is no value in the "lock depth" field contained in trace events; they
measure the behavior of the big kernel lock, which was removed  for
2.6.39.  But that is how it goes, responded Ingo; if the tool is useful and
the code is open we will not break it.
<p>
Steve Rostedt said that these problems are the result of bad ABI design.
We need, he said, a better ABI that is easier to support; "we need a
platform."  Ingo responded that it is still early in the game for tracing
infrastructure; we will need another ten years to really get it right.  We
should, he said, figure out the tools first, only then will we know what
the kernel needs to provide.  We need tools that will increase tracing use
by an order of magnitude; messing with the ABI now will not accomplish
that.
<p>
Linus added that it's not the ABI that matters, it's backward
compatibility.  Anybody who does not understand that, he said, does not
belong in technology.  People blow it all the time, breaking things that
used to work; desktop environments were cited as an example.  He said that
there is no real point in talking about getting the ABI right because we
will not achieve it.  What we will do is avoid breaking the tools; in the
end, what the tools actually use is the ABI.
<p>
Ted Ts'o raised the issue of trying to make a distinction between
tracepoints that are intended to be a part of the ABI and those that should
be treated more like <tt>printk()</tt>.  But Linus said that it was not
going to work, that the effort needs to go elsewhere.  He complained that
people are still talking about <a href="/Articles/442113/">how PowerTop
broke</a> in response to a tracepoint change; it would have been better, he
said, to put the effort into fixing PowerTop.  If that had been done, then
the change could be applied in five years or so.  Ingo added that we should
not legislate an ABI for as-yet nonexistent tracing tools; we should,
instead, let things develop together.  Phasing out ABIs is relatively easy
in the tracing arena because users naturally want current tools.
<p>
Few hard conclusions were reached in this session; with luck, though, we
will at least see some new tools out of Google before too long.

<p>
Aren't those outcomes opposites of each other?  Even if one accepts a fuzzy pseudo-ABI treatment for some parts of the kernel-userspace interface, the moment some "useful and open" external tool uses it, it'd have to be preserved.  At that point, there's no point moving more tool sources into the kernel tree, just to enable changing that pseudo-ABI more easily.<br>

KS2011: Tracing for large-scale data centers:<br>
<p>
IMHO there is much more than ABI that matters for tracing.<br>
<p>
For a trace to be useful not only the ABI should be compatible but also the <br>
calltrace, the timing and the global behaviour.<br>
<p>
If the tracing infrastructure is really heading for common deployment it will<br>
be used a lot!  Not only a few script here and there but many scripts running<br>
in parallel on a production system.<br>
<p>
Tracing is not only about simply dumping a few tracepoints including additional<br>
information to userspace but to get a picture about what's going on.<br>
    Just dumping data to userspace even if compatible between different kernel<br>
versions but with ever changing internal structures (not C structures but <br>
implementations, features, timing, ...) is NOT going to work very well in the<br>
long run!<br>
<p>
BUT from the requirement "compatible ABI, calltrace, timing and global<br>
behaviour" it is clear that this is not doable with the current approach as it<br>
would mean completely locked down and stable kernel internals.  Thus one <br>
approach which might work is define "virtual tracepoints" of events that are<br>
not implementation depended to the current kernel architecture.<br>
    E.g for the process/scheduler part which can also be provided with some future<br>
new scheduler implementation.  All of those "virtual tracepoints" may be<br>
grouped by section, so one group for processes one for block i/o, one for<br>
network, ...  This "virtual tracepoints" should define a stable ABI and should<br>
never change, not for the arguments and also not for the behaviour.<br>
<p>
Then there may be the normal tracepoint (maybe even called dirty probes *g*)<br>
which ARE implementation depended. Even those tracepoints are _required_,<br>
because sometimes we have to deal with problems from a particular<br>
implementation (e.g cfq making some problems). No stable ABI can ever be<br>
defined to full cover every aspect of cfq and guarantee compatibility with<br>
every future i/o scheduler, so why bother to define one?  There may be a set of<br>
probes in the block i/o group to get some scheduler informations but only<br>
common to all scheduler.  (e.g latency's of all io requests by this pid, or by<br>
processname matching this pattern).<br>
<p>
Maybe, even providing an abstract custom language to filter informations and let<br>
it run on a VM in the kernel itself.<br>
The language itself should be designed in a way to not let the user crash the system<br>
or hang in an infinit loop.<br>
<p>
All this infrastructure should be usable on a heavy loaded production system<br>
without even the tiniest chance of disrupting operations.<br>
<p>
Some future considerations:<br>
  - A proper tracing infrastructure might supersede many kernel &lt;-&gt; userspace<br>
    interfaces, as they are all special cases of a programmable information<br>
    gathering framework within the kernel.<br>

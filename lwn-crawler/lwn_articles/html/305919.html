           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 4, 2008</br>
           </div>
In the good old days, video graphics drivers ran in user space and the
kernel had little to do with video memory.  More recently, graphics
developers have decisively voted for change and, in the process, moved
video memory management into the kernel.  So now the kernel must often
manipulate video memory directly.  And that, as it turns out, is harder
than one might expect - at least, on 32-bit machines if the user actually
cares about reasonable performance.
<p>
The problem is that 32-bit machines have a mere 4GB of virtual address
space.  Linux (usually) splits that space in two; the bottom 3GB are given
to user space, while the kernel itself occupies the top 1GB.  Splitting the
space in this way yields an important advantage: there is no need to adjust
the memory management configuration on transitions between kernel and user
space, which speeds things up considerably.  The down side is that the
kernel has to fit in the remaining gigabyte of memory.  That would not seem
like much of a problem, even with contemporary kernels, but remember one
thing: the kernel needs to map physical memory into its address space
before it can do anything with it.  So the amount of virtual address space
given to the kernel limits the amount of physical memory it can manipulate
directly.
<p>
One other thing that must fit into the kernel's address space is the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> area - a range of addresses which can be assigned on the
fly to create needed mappings in the kernel.  When a virtually-contiguous
range of memory is allocated with <tt>vmalloc()</tt>, it is mapped in this
range.  Another user of this address space is <tt>ioremap()</tt>, which
makes a range of I/O memory available to the kernel.
<p>
Device drivers typically need access to I/O memory, so they use
<tt>ioremap()</tt> to map it into the kernel's address space.  Graphics
adapters are a little different, though, in that they have <i>large</i> I/O
memory regions: the entirety of video memory.  Contemporary graphics
adapters can carry a lot of video memory, to the point that mapping it with
<tt>ioremap()</tt> would require far too much address space, if, indeed, it
fits in there at all.  So a straight <tt>ioremap()</tt> is not feasible;
life was much easier in the old days when this I/O memory was mapped into
user space instead.
<p>
The Intel i915 developers, who are the farthest ahead when it comes to
kernel-based GPU memory management, ran into this problem first.  Their
initial solution was to map individual pages as needed with
<tt>ioremap()</tt> (or, strictly, <tt>ioremap_wc()</tt>, which turns on
write combining - see <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/282250/">this article</a> for more details),
and unmapping 
them afterward.  This solution works, but it's slow.  Among other things,
an <tt>ioremap()</tt> operation requires a cross-processor interrupt to be
sure that all CPUs know about the address space change.  It is a function
which was designed to be called infrequently, outside of
performance-critical code.  Making <tt>ioremap()</tt> calls a part of most
graphical operations is not the way to obtain a satisfactory first-person
shooter experience.
<p>
The real <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/305734/">solution</a> comes in
the form of a new mapping API developed by Keith Packard (and subsequently
tweaked by Ingo Molnar).  It draws heavily on the fact that Linux has had
to solve this kind of problem before.  Remember that the kernel (on 32-bit
systems) only has 1GB of address space to work with; that is the maximum
amount of physical memory it can ever have directly mapped at any given
time.  Any physical memory above that amount is called "high memory"; it is
normally not mapped into the kernel's address space.  Access to that memory
requires an explicit mapping - using <tt>kmap()</tt> or
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> - first.  High memory is thus trickier to use, but
this trick has enabled 32-bit systems to support far more memory than was
once thought possible.
<p>

The new mapping API draws more than inspiration from the treatment of high
memory - it uses much of the same mechanism as well.  A driver which needs
to map a large I/O area sets up the mapping with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    struct io_mapping *io_mapping_create_wc(unsigned long base,
					    unsigned long size);
</pre>
<p>
This function returns the <tt>struct io_mapping</tt> pointer, but it does
not actually map any of the I/O memory into the kernel's address space.
That must be done a page at a time with a call to one of:
<p>
<pre>
    void *io_mapping_map_atomic_wc(struct io_mapping *mapping,
				   unsigned long offset);
    void *io_mapping_map_wc(struct io_mapping *mapping, unsigned long offset);
</pre>
<p>
Either function will return a kernel-space pointer which is mapped to the
page at the given <tt>offset</tt>.  
The atomic form is essentially a <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> call - it uses the
<tt>KM_USER0</tt> slot, which is a good thing for developers to know
about.  It is, by far, the faster of the two, but it requires that the
mapping be held by atomic code, and only one page at a time can be mapped
in this way.  Code which might sleep must use
<tt>io_mapping_map_wc()</tt>, which currently falls back to the old
<tt>ioremap_wc()</tt> implementation.
<p>

Mapped pages should be unmapped when no longer needed, of course:
<p>
<pre>
    void io_mapping_unmap_atomic(void *vaddr);
    void io_mapping_unmap(void *vaddr);
</pre>
<p>
There are some interesting aspects to this implementation.  One is that
<tt>struct io_mapping</tt> is never actually defined anywhere.  The code
need not remember anything except the base address, so the return value
from <tt>io_mapping_create_wc()</tt> is just the <tt>base</tt> pointer
which was passed in.  The other is that all of this structure is really
only needed on 32-bit systems; a 64-bit processor has no trouble finding
enough address space to map video memory.  So, on 64-bit systems,
<tt>io_mapping_create_wc()</tt> just maps the entire region with
<tt>ioremap_wc()</tt>; the individual page operations are no-ops.
<p>
Keith <a href="/Articles/305924/">reports</a> that, with this change,
Quake&nbsp;3 (used for testing purposes only, of course) runs 18 times
faster.  The far more serious Dave Airlie <a
href="/Articles/305925/">tested with glxgears</a> and got an increase from
85 frames/second to 380.  This is a big enough improvement that they would
like to see this code go into 2.6.28, which will contain the GEM memory
manager code.  Linus <a href="/Articles/305926/">responds</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm inclined to agree. Not that I think 380fps sounds very
	impressive (I get 850+ fps with _software_ rendering, for
	chissake), but because 85 fps is a joke, and clearly without this
	setup there's not even any point to try to do any other
	optimizations.
</div>
<p>
As a result, this code has been merged into the mainline and will appear in
2.6.28-rc4.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Goddammit, glxgears is NOT a benchmark. The GL library might be cheating above 70 fps, because humans hardly notice fps changes that way up. And FWIW, if you think 380 is a lot, come again, runs on the later NV chpis (NV30 and up perhaps?) the fps rate is in the excess of 10000. Makes your 380 look like a joke.<br>

In this case, glxgears wasn't being used to compare one GL implementation against another, but instead slightly different versions of the same driver.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, if the driver in question did cheat at high speeds, I doubt David would have used glxgears as a test.  Under those conditions, using glxgears was probably a simple way to determine the effects of the change.<br>

Look, you have to start somewhere. It's not like linux &lt;2.6 (or &lt;2.6.10?) was that great for all kinds of workloads, and it certainly took quite a bit of work fixing it in the 2.5 and 2.6 series. <br>
<p>
<p>
Nobody has really worked on graphics in the same way. This is just the beginning, besides hardware does not provide a generic interface such as the intel and amd hardware does. So it's not that easy.<br>
<p>
Also,  I'm sure nvidia has quite a bit of resources to throw at their driver. They even have time to hardcode (like rewriting shader x if game y). That is just insane from resource perspective. <br>

Ya. Glxgears runs slower with hardware acceleration on that driver.<br>
<p>
 That's one of the reasons why Glxgears makes a lousy benchmark for many purposes.  But it still is useful as a microbenchmark as a way to find certain types bottlenecks. It's obvious that there is a still lot of room for improvement.<br>

<h1>Semaphores and mutexes</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/163269/">Last week's Kernel Page</a>
covered the mutex patch by David Howells.  The discussion did not stop at
that point, however, so here's this week's episode.
<p>

There was some fairly strong pushback against the mutex patch after last
week's article was written.  Linus <a href="/Articles/165040/">expressed
his thoughts</a> this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
A patch that
<ul>
<li> creates a non-counting mutex
<li> .. that is SLOWER than the current counting one
<li> .. and keeps the old "semaphore" and "up/down" naming
</ul>
<p>
is simply INCREDIBLY BROKEN. It has absolutely _zero_ redeeming features. 
I can't understand how there are a hundred emails in my mailbox even 
discussing it. 
</div>
<p>
Here is <a href="/Articles/165041/">Andrew Morton's take</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I must say that my interest in this stuff is down in
	needs-an-electron-microscope-to-locate territory.  down() and up()
	work just fine and they're small, efficient, well-debugged and
	well-understood.  We need a damn good reason for taking on
	tree-wide churn or incompatible renames or addition of risk.
	What's the damn good reason here?
<p>
	Please.  Go fix some bugs.  We're not short of them.
</div>
<p>

The objections should be coming into focus at this point.  One problem had
to do with performance; the mutex patch was supposed to be faster, but that
was not the case in the posted version (which lacked architecture-specific
implementations).  There was a long discussion on why the semaphore code
could not be improved on in this regard.  It seems that, on the most
popular architectures at least, the locked decrement-and-test code used by
semaphores is hard to beat.
<p>
David's patch also introduced a sort of global flag day, changing the
locking primitives used by vast amounts of code all at once.  But it kept
the old semaphore function names and applied them to the new mutex type,
creating a confusing sort of interface.  There was resistance to this
choice of naming, but also a great deal of resistance to the idea of making
major changes throughout the kernel without a very strong idea of what was
being gained for it.  All told, the mutex patch set looked like it had a
rough road ahead of it.
<p>

Enter Ingo Molnar, who has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/164802/">a mutex patch of his own</a>.
Ingo's mutexes are derived from the code used in the realtime preemption
patch, of course, but they have been heavily modified to avoid the
objections which greeted David's patch.  In this version, a mutex is a
separate data type, with its own API:
<p>
<pre>
     DEFINE_MUTEX(name);

     mutex_init(mutex);
 
     void mutex_lock(struct mutex *lock);
     int mutex_lock_interruptible(struct mutex *lock);
     int mutex_trylock(struct mutex *lock);
     void mutex_unlock(struct mutex *lock);
     int mutex_is_locked(struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>

The existing semaphore interface is not changed in any way - at least, not
in any way visible to the rest of the kernel.  There is an interesting
feature, however: the semaphore functions (<tt>down()</tt>, <tt>up()</tt>,
and friends) have been augmented to be able to handle mutex arguments as
well as semaphores.  This feature is a migration tool: a subsystem which is
being considered for migration over to the mutex type can have its
semaphores changed to mutexes, but no other code changes are required.  The
various checks built into the mutex type will quickly set off alarms if a
mutex is being used as a counting semaphore.  In that case, the locks can
be changed back to semaphores and the whole episode forgotten.  If,
instead, all seems well, the semaphore calls can be turned into mutex
calls.  Eventually, when the migration work is complete, this helper code
can be removed from the kernel.
<p>

The real point of all the above is that, unlike David's patch, this version
of mutexes imposes no flag day on the kernel.  It is a new primitive, with
its own API, and bits of the kernel can be converted over one by one.
<p>


Ingo claims that his mutex code is significantly faster than semaphores
used as mutexes.  The code itself is a bit smaller and tighter, which
helps.  But he also gets some impressive performance improvements on some
tests: a filesystem-based test more than doubled its speed on an
eight-processor system.  That is the sort of improvement which can help to
motivate the quick merging of a patch.
<p>

In this case, developers started to wonder just why the semaphore code
was so much slower.  Some research turned up the fact that, on the x86
architecture, each cycle through a semaphore had the potential to wake up
two separate waiting processes, each of which would then contend for the
lock.  Nobody knows why the code is this way - Linus is <a
href="/Articles/165045/">mystified by it</a>.  It quickly became clear,
though, that taking out the redundant wakeup breaks the semaphores and
causes lockups.  For now, it is a bit of black magic which must remain for
the whole thing to work.
<p>

Ingo quickly <a href="/Articles/165046/">seized on this revelation</a> to
drive home one of his other points:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If this really is a bug that hid for years, it shows that the
	semaphore code is too complex to be properly reviewed and
	improved. Hence even assuming that the mutex code does not bring
	direct code advantages (which i'm disputing :-), the mutex code is
	far simpler and thus easier to improve.
</div>
<p>
Linus seems to have <a href="/Articles/165047/">heard this argument</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And don't get me wrong: if it's easier to just ignore the
	performance bug, and introduce a new "struct mutex" that just
	doesn't have it, I'm all for it.
</div>
<p>
He doesn't like the under-the-hood semaphore changes, though, and would
like that part of the patch taken out.
<p>
Ingo's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/164802/">initial posting</a>
contains no less than ten reasons why he thinks the mutex patch should go
on; rather than try to rephrase all of those arguments, your editor
suggests going straight to the source.  It is worth noting that, among
other things, merging this mutex patch would move another piece of the
realtime preemption patch into the mainline - even though many of the
realtime-specific features (priority inheritance, for example) are
missing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      That initial post of mingo's ranks up there with his initial O(1) scheduler patch as a classic of patch posting. It does *everything* right (at least on a diplomatic level; this being mingo we can pretty much assume a good design as well). It puts virtally every piece of corporate presentation puffing some new thing or other to shame.<br>

      When one looks back on Ingo's <A href="http://people.redhat.com/mingo"> contributions</A> to kernel performance/functionality, the mind boggles.  He's the Richard Feynman of kernel hacking -- he hardly reads the literature, he just thinks and codes clearly, and he even has a bit of the showman in him.

      There was a discussion once on LWN, started by LM of BK fame, about Red Hat not being an innovative company or some such. Now, with this stuff from Ingo and the new syscalls from Ulrich, I think such talk has been put to rest and all in the space of two LWN articles :-)<br>

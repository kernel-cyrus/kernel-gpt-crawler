<p>What is a kernel developer to do when they need a simple hashing
function to use in a new hash table, and they find that the obvious
choice provided by the kernel works poorly?  The &quot;right&quot; option is
to fix the common code.  The &quot;easy&quot; option is to write a replacement
or a workaround.  The &quot;best&quot; option, it seems, is to make sure Linus
Torvalds finds out, because this is just the sort of thing that he
cares about.</p>

<p>Linux has a fairly simple and efficient set of hashing functions in
<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/hash.h?id=b562e44f507e863c6792946e4e1b1449fbbac85d"><tt>include/linux/hash.h</tt></a>
that work on simple input values: 32-bit or 
64-bit numbers, or pointers that are cast to one of those depending
on the architecture.  The hash is computed by multiplying the input by one
large number and ignoring any overflow, thus effectively taking
the remainder of a division by another large number: 2<sup>32</sup> or
2<sup>64</sup>, depending on the word size.  The
required number of bits are then extracted from the result.</p>

<p>When Thomas Gleixner was testing his <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/685425/">second patch set</a> for <a
href="/Articles/685769/">making 
futexes faster</a>, he 
discovered that the hash values returned weren't 
particularly evenly distributed and, as a result, he was receiving more
collisions than 
expected.  He addressed this problem by writing a simple alternative,
sparking <a
href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/linux/kernel/2428809">a
sub-thread</a> exploring the problems with these hash functions.  As
Torvalds found during subsequent investigations, Gleixner was
not the first developer to decide it was easier not to fix the broken
function.  When working on the RAID 5/6 code for Btrfs, David Woodhouse,
or possibly Chris Mason, discovered problems with the &quot;<tt>hash_64()</tt>&quot;
function and helpfully <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/btrfs/raid56.c?id=53b381b3abeb86f12787a6c40fee9b2f71edc23b#n195">provided a comment</a>:</p>
<p>
<pre>
     * we shift down quite a bit.  We're using byte
     * addressing, and most of the lower bits are zeros.
     * This tends to upset hash_64, and it consistently
     * returns just one or two different values.
</pre>

<p>

It was determined that zeros in the lower-order bits result in the
remaining bits not being mixed well, so there is not much variation in the
output —  not a
particularly useful property for a hash function.  The chosen response
was not to fix <tt>hash_64()</tt> but to shift down the input to hide the
problem.</p>

<p>Some eight years ago, Matthew Wilcox <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4e701482d1d7b90c358e2bd244bb71623f767120">made some changes</a> to the
interfaces for the hash function and noted in the commit message:</p>
<p>
<div class=BigQuote>
    The 32-bit version is more efficient (and apparently gives better hash
    results than the 64-bit version), so users who are only hashing a 32-bit
    quantity can now opt to use the 32-bit version explicitly
</div>

<p>So he, too, knew that there were problems with the hashing function,
particularly the 64-bit version.  It would be naive to think that these
three are the only developers to have noticed a problem but none made
the effort to fix it.  In the 14 years since this code was <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?id=e5191c50d12621e04f8bc247dcb6a0f4ad76ae26">introduced</a>,
several people have
noticed a problem and no one has bothered to fix it.  This is an example
of what has become known as the &quot;<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/443531/">platform problem</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Fortunately Torvalds was interested in the futex changes and so paid
attention to the second patch set from Gleixner.  He made no comment
on the futex changes, but did take interest in the hash changes,
<a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/CA+55aFyjYkwkTo2bNYqJ6h4mr1bbT5Vrak+EtiZmujOD-NzMOQ@mail.gmail.com">researching</a>
the problem and orchestrating the fix. 
The key issue turned out to be the number that the input is multiplied by.
Supposedly based on recommendations from Donald Knuth, this number was
chosen to be a prime and to be approximately the fractional part of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a>
multiplied by 2<sup>64</sup> (in the 64-bit case).
A prime was chosen that was &quot;bit sparse&quot;, having 
long runs of ones or zeros in the binary representation.</p>

<p>This latter choice was guided by the desire for the multiplication to
be fast.  On some hardware, shifts and addition or subtraction can be
faster than general multiplication and with fewer runs in the binary
pattern, fewer additions or subtractions are needed.  For the 64-bit
case, the pattern is particularly sparse, having a run of 33 one bits.</p>
<p>
<pre>
    /*  2^63 + 2^61 - 2^57 + 2^54 - 2^51 - 2^18 + 1 */
    #define GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME_64 0x9e37fffffffc0001UL
</pre>

<p>This sparseness was the problem.  Torvalds's research suggested that
the primality was barely interesting and a misunderstanding.  As
George Spelvin later <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160429233115.8864.qmail@ns.horizon.com">explained</a> it:</p>
<p>
<div class=BigQuote>
  One thing I note is that the advice in the comments to choose a prime
  number is misquoting Knuth!  Knuth says (vol. 3 section 6.4) the number
  should be *relatively* prime to the word size, which for binary computers
  simply means odd.
</div>

<p>It also appears that the golden ratio is not all that magical. It is
just a convenient number that is, as Torvalds put it, "<q>an
irrational number that is not near to 0 or 1</q>".
The important property was to have "<q>roughly 50% of the bits set
   in a random pattern</q>" so the resultant mixing of bits would hide
   any patterns in the input.  The current hash function, it seems,
   emphasizes exactly the wrong qualities.

<p>Once the problem was understood, fixing it was relatively
straightforward:  just pick a better multiplier with more "randomness"
in the bit pattern.  This was done by <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160502102248.18755.qmail@ns.horizon.com">approximating
an irrational value</a> and not worrying about primality or bit-sparseness.
On hardware without 64-bit multiplication, the two 32-bit halves of the
64-bit input are hashed sequentially so two 32-bit multiplications are
used.  This doesn't return a 64-bit number, but no code ever wants
more than 32 bits of hash, so not providing the full 64 is no loss.</p>

<p>Spelvin made good use of the opportunity provided by this need to
adjust the hash functions and examined other hashing code, fixing up
the <tt>hash_mem()</tt> and <tt>hash_str()</tt> function in the sunrpc code
(used by <tt>nfsd</tt>) and suggesting improvements for some simplistic
hashing used in the inode cache.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/CA+55aFyPMrAWqMaA013ZQA0TULtdTXbUh4rgUurMLu40TastuA@mail.gmail.com">minimal fix</a> has landed for Linux 4.6-rc7 with a more complete
fix expected for v4.7.  It is good to know that this problem with the
Linux kernel platform has been addressed, but it does lead one to
wonder what other problems there are that have been conveniently
ignored by many of us, and just need a little light to shine on them at
the right time for the problem to be quickly fixed.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The golden ratio actually does have a nice property in itself, beyond being irrational. It turns out that if you do ϕ, 2ϕ, 3ϕ etc. (all of them modulo 1), they will tend to fall as far as possible from any of the previous values. So you get very nice spreading properties for consecutive values, which can be an important special case for hashing.<br>

I see that I posted something similar to the "platform problem" article... if one is afraid to dive into "unknown" code and fix it, then at least adding a "todo" comment in the right place might be the next best thing.  As long as reviewers are supportive of this and do not come down on people to just do the work.<br>

I no longer remember who told me in 2008 that the 32-bit hash was "better". I certainly didn't do any experiments of my own to confirm this.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we could add tests of the "goodness" of the hash functions to tools/testing? It's been invaluable for preventing regressions of the radix tree code.<br>

It is part of the human condition, visible in many communities, that it is easier to say "we could" or "we should" rather than "I will".  I think the "platform problem" is, in part, how that condition manifests in this community.<br>
<p>
Not that it is necessarily wrong to say "we could": people who say "I will" too often can easily get burnt out.<br>
<p>
Some sort of balance is best: where many in the community feel empowered, encouraged, and even permitted, to say "I will", without feeling undue pressure (so no "You should"!).<br>
Someone out there probably wants to take the test harness that Linus threw together (mentioned in the email thread) and put it in tools/testing in a useful way.  What can we ... What can *I* do to permit, empower, and encourage that?<br>

I think it's an honest acknowledgement of the length of our own TODO lists and the likelihood that this task would ever bubble up to the top of it.<br>
<p>
But this is a great opportunity for someone who wants to improve the kernel in a quantifiable way to get involved. It's almost entirely user-space programming, but it involves working with kernel code. Everybody agrees we need better testing, so there's likely to be positive feedback.<br>
<p>
Now, how best to bring this idea to the attention of someone who has time and inclination to work on it?<br>

If I can’t say "this should be fixed" without somebody piping up "fix it, then", I may just opt for keeping silent. Exactly the problem described in the article.<br>

Alternatives? Anonymous bug reporting? Adding it to a list of newbie projects?<br>

This is tangential, but I've long wondered about "George Spelvin", more accurately linux@horizon.net because "George Spelvin" is a classic pseudonym [1] which they only started using relatively recently.<br>
<p>
They are obviously a very skilled hacker who have been around Linux for a long time. Though I can't find the reference immediately, I remember them correcting/optimizing someone's PPC(?) assembly code, then stating mild uncertainty because they "don't have access to hardware to test it." (As I remember it, the optimized code worked flawlessly).<br>

Ah, here was their assembly code without access to HW:<br>

Of note, this was also work on a hash  function.<br>

      <P>Wouldn't it be something if "George Spelvin" was actually Knuth?<TT>  ;-)</TT></P>
<P>(It seems unlikely, but I'm amused by the possibility.)</P>

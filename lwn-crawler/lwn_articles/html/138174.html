<h1>The beginning of the realtime preemption debate</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 1, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Merging Ingo Molnar's realtime preemption work was never going to be a
quiet process.  The noise has, in fact, begun long before Ingo has even
proposed his work for inclusion.  Now might be a good time to catch up with
the debate as a way of seeing how the arguments might go in the
future.
<p>

The realtime preemption patches attempt to provide a guaranteed maximum
response time for high-priority user-space processes - just like a "real"
realtime operating system would.  This goal is achieved by making
<i>everything</i> in the kernel preemptible.  No matter what the kernel is
doing on a given processor, if a higher-priority process becomes runnable,
it will be scheduled immediately.  Many changes are required to make the
whole kernel preemptible; the core parts are:
<p>
<ul>

<li> New locking primitives.  The spinlocks used by the kernel can cause
     any number of processors to stall while waiting for a lock to become
     free.  Code which holds a spinlock cannot be preempted, or a
     deadlocked kernel could result.  The realtime preemption patches
     introduce a new mutual exclusion type (the rt_mutex) which does not
     spin, and, thus, will not stall a processor.  The spinlocks and
     semaphores currently used in the kernel are all converted over to the
     new rt_mutex type, and all code which runs with spinlocks held becomes
     preemptible.  The rt_mutex type also implements priority inheritance,
     so that a low-priority process will not block a higher-priority
     process (for long, at least) by losing the processor while holding an
     important lock.
<p>
<li> Threaded interrupt handlers.  Interrupt handlers can create latencies
     by monopolizing the processor for long periods of time.  The realtime
     preemption patch moves interrupt handling into kernel threads, which
     contend for the processor with all other processes in the system.  If
     a certain realtime task is more important than interrupt handling, its
     priority can be set accordingly.
<p>
<li> Various other mutual exclusion mechanisms, including read-copy-update,
     per-CPU variables, and seqlocks, require that preemption be disabled.
     All of these mechanisms are changed for the realtime preemption mode,
     usually by making them look more like regular spinlocks.
</ul>
<p>

The realtime preemption patch set (at version <a
href="/Articles/137796/">-RT-2.6.12-rc5-V0.7.47-10</a> as of this writing)
is clearly large and intrusive - it would be hard to make fundamental
changes like those listed above any other way.  It should be noted that
Ingo has gone out of his way to minimize this intrusiveness, however: the
patch is written to minimize code changes, and the kernel functions as
always if realtime preemption is not selected at configuration time.  The
merging of this patch set would not force the new preemption model on
users. 
<p>

<a href="/Articles/138180/">According to Lee Revell</a>, the realtime
preemption patches are already seeing some serious use:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	All of the Linux audio oriented distributions are already shipping
	-RT kernels, and most of the serious Linux audio users who use
	general purpose distros are running it.  That's a few thousand
	people running it 24/7 for months, and it's been at least a month
	since any of these users found a real bug in -RT.
</div>
<p>
Certainly the discussions that inevitably follow the release of a new
version of the patch set indicate that there is an active user community
out there.  Some members of the community are starting to wonder why the
realtime preemption patches have not been merged, and when (if ever) that
might change.  The biggest reason is that Ingo has not yet requested that
the patches be included - though many small pieces and fixes from the
realtime patch set have found their way into the mainline.  If and when
Ingo does push for inclusion, however, there will be some opposition.
<p>

To some developers, the realtime patch seems like a set of questionable
and widespread changes aimed at the needs of a very small user community.
Changing spinlocks into mutexes and moving interrupt handlers into threads
are fundamental changes to how the kernel does things with the potential
for the creation of subtle bugs and performance problems.  Reworking things
and adding complexity at that level is not a task that should be undertaken
without a strong need - and many developers do not see a sufficiently
strong need.
<p>

There are some concerns about the performance impact of these changes.
Acquiring an uncontended spinlock is a very fast operation; the rt_mutex
type, with its wait queues and priority inheritance mechanisms, is bound to
be slower.  There is some <a href="/Articles/138184/">anecdotal
evidence</a> that there is a performance hit to realtime preemption, but
little in the way of real benchmarking has been done.  In any case, the
performance penalty should only affect users who have actually enabled the
realtime preemption mode.
<p>

Finally, not everybody is convinced that the realtime preemption approach
can solve the real problem: providing an ironclad guarantee that a realtime
process will be scheduled within a given maximum latency.  Ingo believes
that this guarantee can be made by eliminating all code within the kernel
which can delay a reschedule; others feel that, to make a guarantee that
can truly be trusted, the entire kernel must be audited and verified.  They
have a point: how strong a guarantee would you want before running realtime
Linux in your car's braking system?
<p>

Those who want true realtime guarantees, along with developers who simply
do not want to clutter the kernel with realtime mechanisms, argue that a
different approach should be taken.  The most commonly suggested
alternative is <a
href="http://www.rtai.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=1">RTAI-Fusion</a>,
which works (at its core) by interposing a "nanokernel" between Linux and
the bare hardware.  The nanokernel guarantees latency by taking the
lowest-level scheduling decisions out of the Linux kernel's hands; it is
kept small and easy to verify.  Another project taking a similar approach
is <a href="http://www.disy.cse.unsw.edu.au/Software/Iguana/">Iguana</a>,
which is based on the <a href="http://www.l4hq.org/">L4 microkernel</a>.
<p>

Since the realtime preemption patch is not being proposed for merging at
this time, no decisions are likely to result from the current, lengthy
discussion.  If Ingo has <a href="/Articles/138188/">his way</a>, there may
never be one big decision; instead, pieces of the patch will be merged if
and when it makes sense.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So i'm afraid nothing radical will happen anywhere. Maybe we can
	have one final flamewar-party in the end when the .config options
	are about to be added, just for nostalgia, ok?

Kernel Summit in Ottawa, however.  Meanwhile, should anybody wish to plow

      I really think RTAI (or the L4 stuff) are a better alternative, or at <br>
least they can provide a way to provide "real" realtime together with <br>
linux. What's actually the current state of RTAI with kernel 2.6 ? Which <br>
architectures are supported ? <br>

      Oh no! Don't start that discussion here as well! It is really long and heated on lkml already! I will dear to add that I disagree, but I will refer to lkml for the arguments. <br>
<p>
Some day, someone will hopefully post a comparison between PREEMPT_RT and RTAI, wrt. how well it works wrt. latencies and performance, and how much work you need to put in to actually use it on _real_ projects.<br>

      Realtime discussions devolve into endless debates _because_ each party defines their interests differently:  Soft realtime, Hard realtime, Provable realtime, desktop use, audio use, braking use, aircraft use, etc. etc.  For a more productive conversation, we need to develop consistent terminology and recognize the value of other applications.<br>
<p>
The nanokernel debate reminds me of the old RISC vs CISC debate.  RISC attempted to use simplification to enable faster execution, but then the CISC people (Intel, et al) proved that with some effort, CISC can run as fast or faster than RISC. RISC really only offered a way to do fast _low budget_ cpu's <br>
<p>
Nanokernel advocates seem to make a similar argument.  They have a low budget (less complex) way to get real time.  If the analogy holds, Ingo's patch will, with some extra effort, provide a way to address realtime requirements with as good or better performance.<br>

      What's with the car brakes argument?  I could probably implement a braking system in 100 lines on <br>
an AVR.  I'm not sure why I'd use a microprocessor and millions of lines of kernel code.<br>
<p>
I wish the audio people would solve the problem differently.  They should be able to pin their <br>
processes exclusively on one or more CPUs, leaving the rest of the lower-priority tasks fighting over <br>
the remaining CPU or CPUs.  This might even be possible with the scheduling domains patch.  I'm <br>
worried that the people who want XMMS to not skip when they mkfs a 2TB device while playing <br>
Quake are going to screw up the kernel for other users.  Linux has a history of making basic <br>
operations like syscall, i/o, schedule, and fork cheaper with each release.  The RT work tends to <br>
make basic operations more expensive, which isn't going to put a smile on the face of your local <br>
mail server sysadmin.  I'm going to go way out on a limb and guess that there are at least 1000 <br>
network server instances for every instance of Linux in audio performance roles.<br>
<p>
Now I'm not suggesting that the majority should rule, but Linux has normally been able to <br>
accomodate weird use cases without compromising the mainstream.  And that's what I'm hoping <br>
shakes out of the RT debate.<br>

      The 'audio people' are not driven by xmms playback issues, although the<br>
general userbase would benifit from  their concerns. They want to be able<br>
to record live sessions and do live performances without drop outs or<br>
clicks, which are show stoppers. This extends to live effects processing<br>
and multimedia capture of all sorts. And the RT patch is completely<br>
optional. It should have zero effect if you dont config it. The debate<br>
is not about how this patch would affect the majority, but if it is the<br>
best solution for a broad range of problems, which, if you read the<br>
ungodly long thread on lkml, seems to have goosed a number of parties,<br>
armchair and otherwise.<br>
<p>
Actually, the issue I would rather have seen presented here would be about<br>
the argument about what exactly 'real time' means. For example, some backers of the RT patch are saying it is better than RTOS's they are using<br>
in their industry, and that it is potentially earthshaking. The adjective<br>
'hard' when combined with 'real time' seems to be where the semantics<br>
get difficult.<br>
<p>
And no one even mentioned the patent fud;)<br>

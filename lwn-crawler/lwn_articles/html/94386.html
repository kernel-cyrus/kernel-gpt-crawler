<h1>Kernel Summit: Development process</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 21, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
For all practical purposes, the final topic of the 2004 Kernel Summit was
the traditional discussion of the development process.  This space is
usually set aside as the time to pressure Linus for a deadline; often
inquiring minds want to know when a feature freeze will happen, but the
issue of interest this time was: when will the 2.7 series begin?  The
answer was somewhat difficult to interpret, but certainly surprising.
<p>

Linus said that he is ready to open 2.7 at about any time; he had
originally thought he would do it in June.  There are, however, a few
concerns which need to be addressed.  One is that he wants better
synchronization with the ongoing 2.6 tree, so that fixes can be forward
ported and interesting developments backported after they stabilize.  Then
there is the fact that a number of people have grown used to having a
BitKeeper tree around for 2.6, and that somehow that should continue after
Linus moves on.  Linus has also been very happy with how the 2.6
development process has gone, with Andrew Morton vetting patches in his -mm tree
and passing on the ones that work for the mainline.
<p>
The end result, says Linus, is that the kernel development process needs "a
BK person for Andrew, and an Andrew for me."  He then batted his eyes at
Alan Cox and asked: "Will you be my Andrew?  Will you be mine?"  One might
have expected Alan to blast a hole in the wall while effecting a hasty
exit, but, instead, he agreed - as long as people are not concerned about
his continued employment with Red Hat.  Andrew, meanwhile, stated that he
has no religious problems with BitKeeper, and was planning on picking it up
at some point.  Thus, he does not necessarily need a "BK person" to help
him out.
<p>

At this point, one might naively conclude that everything has been worked
out, but things are not destined to be so simple.
<p>

Linus talked about how happy just about everybody is with 2.6.  It has been
almost two years since the alleged 2.5 feature freeze, but there still is
no great pressure to start a new development series.  Linus asks: could
things just go on the way they are for a while yet, until enough pressure
forms to force the 2.7 fork?
<p>

Bdale Garbee pointed out that, in the absence of a 2.7, many people will
conclude that 2.6 has not yet stabilized sufficiently.  There may be a need
to do the fork just to convince people that 2.6 is ready.  Alan Cox had a
different idea: given that there is not a great deal of stuff to merge into
2.7, perhaps the developers could actually do a six-month release cycle for
a change?
<p>

Andrew pointed out that, during the 2.6 process, he and Linus have been
merging patches at a rate of about 10MB/month.  There is, he says, no
reason to believe that things will not continue that way.  The traditional
stabilization mechanism, where almost no patches are accepted for long
periods of time, does not strike him as a good idea.  Instead, Andrew would
like to see a 2.6 tree which continues to change and evolve, and let the
distributors do the final stabilization work.  In his vision of the future,
the kernel.org kernel will be the most featureful and fastest kernel out
there, but it will not necessarily be the most stable.
<p>

The idea here is that restricting changes creates an incredible "patch
pressure," which eventually leads to massive amounts of changes going into
the kernel suddenly.  At that point, things really do become unstable.  It
is better to keep the flow rate on patches higher; that keeps the
developers happy and gets new code out to users quicker.  Andrew really
believes this: there are, seemingly, very few patches that he is not
willing to accept into 2.6 - as long as they make sense and survive testing
in -mm.
<p>

These patches include API changes, incidentally.  Stable internal kernel
APIs have never been guaranteed, but the developers have usually tried to
not make big changes during a stable kernel series.  That looks to change
now.  Among other things, it was said that API changes should be merged
<i>before</i> an eventual 2.7 fork, since that would make synchronization
between the two trees easier.  Your editor, who really would like to see
<i>Linux Device Drivers</i> not go obsolete before it hits the shelves,
finds this idea somewhat dismaying.

<p>
What may happen is that Linus creates a 2.7 tree in the near future, but
that tree will be restricted to truly experimental, destabilizing changes.
This tree may have no future: if it doesn't work out, or can't be kept in
sync with 2.6, it might simply be dropped.  Or it could yet develop into
2.8, if that makes sense.

<p>
Nothing was truly resolved in this discussion, which will certainly
continue in the hallways and bars over the next few days.  But the Linux
kernel is maturing, and the development process looks like it will be
changing in response.  This could be cause for concern, except for one
important thing: the 2.6 series really <i>has</i> worked very well.  The
kernel is in good hands, and that is one thing that looks like it will not
change.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Putting the onus of stablization on the &quot;distributions&quot; spells the eventual end of independent Linux users/developers.  I have been hearing rumours that glibc is heading down this same path.  Without stable, reference milestones it will artificially increase the barrier to moving beyond dependence on a single vendor.  A co-dependency mentality sets in, &quot;why should I make any effort in this area when the bar for doing anything different is so high&quot;.  Creative energy moves on to other areas of life (or other OS) where it is more effective.  Innovation outside of the corporate sponsored environment dries up.  Linux loses mindshare in the hearts of the people as an underdog.  It becomes just another product manufactured by corporations.  Goodbye, Linux.

      Well, the mainline 2.6 kernels have been quite stable; certainly stable <br>enough most private users. <br>The extra hardening is required for servers that do extreme stuff or <br>have extreme hardware. The mainline kernel may thus not always be <br>suitable for all of those. <br>This is not necessarily as bad as it sounds. Most people who use <br>such machines do want to have a support contract anyway ...

      On the other hand, imagine a world where the distributors actually ship something close to the mainline kernel (because it already contains their patches) and developers can actually hope to see their work distributed in a reasonable period of time.  These changes could actually make vendor kernels more alike and life easier for independent developers.

      I for one am very excited.  It is difficult to get customers to pay for kernel work in the development branch.  Almost everyone wants their work done against the production branch.  A longer active development lifetime for 2.6 means more potential for contributions from commercial developers.

      I'm not convinced that side of things is a big deal. It's possible that <br>some distribution-neutral &quot;linux-STABLE&quot; will evolve over time, with <br>distributions sharing maintainance. I'd say it's even likely. If not, I <br>don't see that much difference between basing a distro on another distro <br>rather than mainline (this is, after all, what most people do anyway).

      The resarch branch idea sounds like one of the ideas that Linus mentioned, where 2.7 would be only for really strange/radical things.<p>Perhaps you could post a summary of the Gnome experience to lkml after the conference.

      I liked Alan's idea that we could move to six-month release cycles for kernels, now that the overall system has stabilized somewhat.  I think we're getting closer to a model of continual refinement instead of radical changes over longer timeframes.  It's a sign that the software is more mature.

      What, do your eyes not work now?  Because if you can't see that, it's because you're not looking.  I did kernels for VA Linux, and we had over 250 patches back in the 2.2.18 days.  Red Hat had about 200 patches too, IIRC.

      Yes, i know that we already have a lot of fragmentation, but we should try to reduce that, not increase that.

      There is some confusion over what "stable" means.  Many people seem to think it means "doesn't crash."  There are better terms for that (like "doesn't crash").  What "stable" <em>really</em> means is "doesn't change."  It describes the branch, not the code at the head of it.
<p>
The correlation, of course, is that the way you make code bug free is to stop changing it, and when it's bug free, you don't have to change it.
<p>
The 2.6 branch is not stable at all.  It's changing like crazy.  Until there is at the very least some other branch to draw the attention of the coders, it will continue to change.
<p>
The death of the Linux stable/development system is due to the long release cycles.  Developers want their stuff to get into users' hands some time before they retire.  The users won't touch an unstable branch, so the stable branch is where it goes.  Which destabilizes the branch.
<p>
Incidentally, the common strategy of putting bug fixes and not features in the stable branch is wrong.  The right strategy is to put code changes with a low risk/reward ratio in the stable branch and those with a high risk/reward ratio in the development branch.  Both bug fixes and features can fit in either of those categories.

      H. Peter Anvin tried to clarify the situation thusly in the<br>'A users thoughts on the new dev. model' thread on lk:<p>I think the discussion we had at the kernel summit has been somewhat<br>misrepresented by LWN et al.  What we discussed was really more of a<br>&quot;soft fork&quot;, with the -mm tree serving the purpose of 2.7, rather than<br>a hard fork with a separate maintainer and putting ourselves in<br>back/forward-porting hell all over again.<p>Note that Andrew's -mm tree *specificially* has infrastructure to keep<br>changes apart and thus backporting to 2.6 mainstream of patches which<br>have proven themselves becomes trivial.<p>Thus:<p>        - Andrew will put experimental patches into -mm;<br>        - Andrew will continue to forward-port 2.6 mainstream fixes to<br>          -mm;<br>        - Patches which have proven themselves stable and useful get<br>          backported to 2.6;<br>        - If the delta between 2.6 and -mm becomes too great we'll<br>          consider a hard fork AT THAT TIME, i.e. fork lazily instead<br>          of the past model of forking eagerly.<p>Why the change?  Because the model already has proven itself, and<br>shown itself to be more functional than what we've had in the past.<br>2.6 is probably the most stable mainline tree we've had since 1.2 or<br>so, and yet Linus and Andrew process *lots* of changes.  The -mm tree<br>has become a very effective filter for what should go into mainline,<br>whereas the odd-number forks generally *haven't* been, because<br>backporting to mainline has usually been an afterthought.<p>I for one welcome our new -mm overlords.<p>        -hpa<br>

      When I originally read this LWN article, I had the same thought, that the <br>reason the dynamics had changed was because the mm tree has been serving <br>as the testing ground that the development tree formerly occupied.  I <br>don't see that LWN misrepresented that. <br> <br>My only question at the time was why all the comments seemed so skewed <br>toward the loss of the development tree, and no one was pointing out how <br>mm was now serving that function.  However, as I was reading it on a total <br>of about a half hour sleep the day before, and no one else was picking up <br>on it, I thought I obviously must have missed something somewhere and <br>resolved that I'd get back to the story after I caught up in sleep. <br> <br>Now that I have, it seems to say the same thing it did before, and at <br>least ONE other poster actually seems to /get/ it (altho I was a bit put <br>off by the /. &quot;overlords&quot; reference). <br> <br>I believe it's worth stating again, here in a slightly different way.  <br>Linus seems to have finally found a teammate he can work closely enough <br>with to make it effective.  The mm tree DOES seem to be serving the <br>purpose of development/testing, allowing a much smoother and more timely <br>flow of pre-tested patches into the &quot;stable&quot; kernel.  Thus, the need for a <br>traditional development kernel is far lessened, and the pressure just <br>isn't there to create it, as it would just be an artificial construct, at <br>this point, with what's currently there working as naturally as it is. <br> <br>It's likely that eventually some huge changes will build in the wings, to <br>much for even mm to take on, without disrupting its current roll as the <br>testing ground for stable.  The flurry of patches after OLS will likely <br>test just how far off that point will be, as they equally test how well <br>the mm/linus feeder mechanism works with even larger changes thrown at it.    <br>If the current system continues to work, it might be some time before 2.7, <br>or indeed the current system may become more or less (most?) permanent, <br>until something comes along to change it, anyway.  If however it shows <br>signs of stress under the additional flexing necessary for the larger and <br>more intrusive patches, people will be forced to back off, and the <br>pressure for a 2.7 will then begin to build.   <br> <br>In some ways, then, the kernel summit and OLS can be seen to have invited <br>a serious test of the system, either potentially triggering that buildup <br>of pressure that hasn't really happened until now, or stress testing the <br>current system such that developers can be comfortable that it WILL hold <br>up under such conditions, and thus comfortable in allowing the new system <br>to really settle in. <br> <br>As for the stability/distributions thing, IMO the new system should be far <br>better in that regard than the old one was.  At least.. it wouldn't seem <br>to be worse.  As another poster already mentioned, 2.6 has already proven <br>quite stable enough for a desktop system, and the folks wanting real <br>stability either tend to roll their own, or get a vendor version complete <br>with support contract anyway.  In fact, if anything, the more timely flow <br>of updates to the &quot;stable&quot; kernel will likely mean *LESS* need for <br>patching from individual vendors than was previously the case, what with <br>the maze of backports and other-source patches in most vendor kernels <br>particularly the couple of releases previous to the switch to the next <br>stable kernel. <br> <br>I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how this &quot;new kernel paradigm&quot; <br>plays out! <br> <br>Duncan <br> <br>

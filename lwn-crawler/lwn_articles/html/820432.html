</div>
Life gets complicated for the kernel when there is nothing for the system
to do.  The obvious response is to put the CPU into an idle state to
save power, but which one?  CPUs offer a wide range of sleep states with
different power-usage and latency characteristics.  Picking too shallow a
state will waste energy, while going too deep hurts latency and can impact
the performance of the system as a whole.  The <a
href="/Articles/775618/">timer-events-oriented (TEO) cpuidle governor</a>
is a relatively new attempt to improve the kernel's choice of sleep states;
at the 2020 <a href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling in the Linux Kernel Summit</a>,
Pratik Sampat presented <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200511141055.43029-2-psampat@linux.ibm.com/">a
variant of the TEO governor</a> that tries to improve its choices further.
<p>
Sampat started with a bit of background.  The TEO governor is based on the
idea that timer events are the most likely way that a system will wake up;
they also happen to be the most deterministic, since they are known before
the system goes idle.  But CPUs are subject to wakeups from other sources —
interrupts in particular — and that complicates the situation.  So the TEO
governor maintains a short history of actual idle times that is used to
come up with a (hopefully) better guess for what the next idle period will
really be.
<p>
This history is an eight-entry circular buffer that indicates the recent
pattern of non-timer wakeups.  When the time comes to pick an idle state,
the TEO governor looks at how many of those wakeups led to a sleep time
that was less than expected; if the answer is "a majority of them", then
the average observed sleep time is used to select an idle state that is
shallower than would have otherwise been chosen.  It works well, he said,
but maybe it can be made better?
<p>
He started by testing the idea of whether more history would improve the
situation.  Increasing the size of the idle-times buffer to 128 did not
really help, though.  With a set of benchmark results, Sampat showed
performance numbers that were sometimes better and sometimes worse; latency
often improved, but power consumption got much worse.  More history led to
the selection of shallower sleep states more often, in other words.
<p>
It turns out, he said, that an average is not a good model of the
distribution of sleep times, and a longer history may not reflect what is
going to happen in the future.  So he concluded that what is needed is to
store and manage the history differently.  The cpuidle governor would
benefit from a way to
answer a specific question: if the kernel is about to pick a given sleep
state, what are the chances that the actual sleep time will better match a
sleep that is one level shallower?
<p>
<h4>The weighted governor</h4>
<p>
The result was the weighted-history TEO governor, which replaces the
history buffer with an NxN matrix, where N is the number of sleep states
supported by the processor.  The rows correspond to the sleep state
the TEO governor would pick in any given situation; each column along that
row indicates the probability that the corresponding state should actually
be chosen.  If the system in question had three sleep states ("shallow",
"medium", and "deep"), the matrix would be initialized to look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <table class="OddEven">
    <tr><th></th><th>Shallow</th><th>Medium</th><th>Deep</th></tr>
    <tr><th>Shallow</th><td align="right">70%</td>
                        <td align="right">15%</td>
			<td align="right">15%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Medium</th><td align="right">15%</td>
                        <td align="right">70%</td>
			<td align="right">15%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Deep</th><td align="right">15%</td>
                        <td align="right">15%</td>
			<td align="right">70%</td></tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, the matrix is set up so that the chances of each state
selection being correct are 70%, with the remaining 30% spread across all
the other states.  Giovanni Gherdovich asked whether this initial
distribution was hard-coded; the answer was "yes for now", and that the
values have been chosen from a set of experiments Sampat ran.
<p>
After each wakeup, the actual behavior is measured and the probabilities
are tweaked accordingly.  The actual amount of adjustment that should be
performed is still unclear, he said; more experiments and testing are
needed.
<p>
When it comes time to make a prediction, the governor uses a biased
random-number generator to pick a state; the biasing is done so that the
chances of picking any particular state are the same as the observed
probability that said state is the correct one.  Why do that rather than
just pick the highest-probability state?  Often it turns out that the
probabilities are fairly close, so a subset of the available states are all
about as likely to be correct.  The system will self-correct when the
random-number generator steers it wrong.
<p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>
A number of benchmark results followed, showing variable results.  With
schedbench, latency was better some times and worse others, but power
consumption was always less.  The accuracy of the sleep-state choices was
similar to the unweighted TEO governor for a small number of threads, but
improved for larger numbers of threads.  Rafael Wysocki, the author of the
TEO governor, said that he was surprised to see TEO doing as well as it
does; he deliberately chose a simple algorithm to minimize the overhead
involved.
<p>
Sampat modified the ebizzy benchmark to make it do occasional sleeps, and
got better results than TEO for both throughput and power consumption.  The
pgbench benchmark showed mixed results, with things getting worse as more

<a href="/Articles/820440/"><img

align="right"></a> 

clients were added.  Hackbench results saw better results with relatively
short run times, and a consistent 8-10% improvement in power consumption.
<p>
At this point, some confusion about the results became evident.  Sampat
characterized the results as "overshooting" or "undershooting", which most
people expected to refer to the sleep state chosen, but actually referred
to the sleep residency time.  So "overshooting" meant picking a sleep state
that was too shallow — the residency time overshot the estimate.  This
terminology seems highly likely to change in the near future.
<p>
Wysocki observed that picking a sleep state that is too shallow is
generally better than picking one that is too deep.  Not sleeping deeply
enough will cost some power, but sleeping too deeply can hurt the
performance of the system (in both latency and throughput terms).
<p>
Sampat finished with an overview of the work that is yet to be done.  The
aging algorithm still needs some work; workloads change over time, and old
history can lead to poor predictions going forward.  He tried simply
decaying the highest-probability state, but that led to large variance in
the results.
<p>
Another issue is the initial weights put in the matrix; these were
determined through experiments, but more testing is needed.  Wysocki
disagreed, though, saying that with proper aging, the initial states don't
matter much.  The governor will correct itself over time.  But that depends
on the aging working well, so that is the important part to work on.  The
session concluded with Wysocki saying that the work looks promising and can
be discussed further on the mailing list.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
The reasoning for the randomization seems... thin?  It’s surely not any worse to just always pick the highest probability, and have a mechanism for tie breaking?<br>

      Bear in mind that the number of sleep states is typically rather larger than the three I showed in the simplified example.  If you are going to pick between four choices, each of which has a probability between, say, 18-22%, does it really make sense to always pick the highest?  In a sense, this <i>is</i> the mechanism for tie breaking.

If you have 4 each around 20%-30%, sure. But if you have a fifth at 1%, probably not. Wouldn't it be more expensive to detect the first case and handle it specially than to just handle the general case?<br>

That still seems to pessimize a bit too much to me. If you have all of them right around 12.5%, why use a selection algorithm that makes half (on average) effectively 0%? Instead of introducing a divide for your average, just track the sum, make a random number within [0, sum) (any other scheme is likely to have something here anyways to get a number within your domain), then subtract off each bucket's size until you get a value &lt; 0 and you've found your selection. Tracking is then just counting into each bucket and the sum and you reweight to avoid overflows every so often. Reweighting after each measurement seems excessively expensive.<br>

If your scheme is quicker than mine at doing the calculation, then fine. I was just thinking that less than half the choices would be above average (and the more widely spread the scores are, the smaller the above-average proportion). So if you want one of the high-rankers, at random, just grabbing anything above average isn't a bad way of doing it.<br>

<h1>InfiniBand: a proprietary standard?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 13, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Greg Kroah-Hartman recently <a href="/Articles/106420/">expressed some
concerns</a> about the InfiniBand specification.  It seems that, if you are
not a member of the <a href="http://www.infinibandta.org/home">InfiniBand
Trade Association</a>, a copy of the specification will cost $9500 - and it
requires signing a license which reads:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	Upon receipt by IBTA of payment for a single copy license to the
	Specification, you are entitled to possess one physical copy of the
	Specification in the form provided to you by IBTA, and to make
	internal, noncommercial use of the Specification within your
	organization. 
</div>
<p>

Such language raises the obvious question: how can anybody write or
distribute a free InfiniBand implementation after having signed that sort
of license?  Things get worse when one looks at <a
href="http://www.infinibandta.org/meminfo/mem-agreement.pdf">the IBTA
membership agreement (PDF)</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	When the member or its Affiliates makes a Contribution or when the
	Steering Committee adopts and approves for release a Specification,
	the Member and its Affiliates hereby agree to grant <b>to other
	members and their affiliates</b> under reasonable terms and
	conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination,
	a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide license under its
	Necessary Claims to allow such Members to make, have made, use,
	import, offer to sell, lease, and sell and otherwise distribute
	Compliant Portions ....
	<p>
	The Member and its Affiliates retain the independent right to grant
	or withhold a nonexclusive license or sublicense of patents
	containing Necessary Claims to non-Members on such terms as the
	Member may determine.
</div>
<p>

(Emphasis added).  The InfiniBand standard, in other words, is allowed to
contain patented technology, only IBTA members must be given the
opportunity to license any patented technology, and only under "reasonable
terms and conditions."  If said "reasonable terms and conditions" included
the right to distribute code under a free license, one would assume those
who wrote the agreement would have seen fit to say so.
<p>
The end result is that InfiniBand looks like a closed, proprietary
standard, and not something which can be supported in free software.  Greg
asked, flat out:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So, OpenIB group, how to you plan to address this issue?  Do you
	all have a position as to how you think your code base can be
	accepted into the main kernel tree given these recent events?
</div>
<p>

In response, there have been some "we don't think it's a problem"
mumblings, but nothing that looks like a real answer to this question.
Until this all gets straightened out, anybody considering using InfiniBand
with free software may well want to think about alternatives.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Time for the Infiniband group to move out of the dark ages. <br>
<p>
The type of environments that could make the best use of Infiniband are exactly the environments most likely to use huge amounts of OSS. <br>
<p>
Given that so many problems in that space today can be solved with standard Copper Gigabit, and that fiber 10 gigabit is continually getting cheaper I do not see how this group hopes to see IBT can see a future for their technology. <br>
<p>
Sure, there are situations where infiniband is superior to Ethernet, but those spaces will continue to shrink, just like commodity clusters have shrunk the space of problems that absolutely need a traditional vector supercomputer. <br>
<p>
Open, low per unit cost solutions dominate cluster computing. The IBT is unecessarily limiting themselves to niche where they could show leadership and grab hold of a market ready for higher interconnect speeds with reasonable terms.<br>
<p>
It is a real shame when good technology has to be ignored because of archaic and narrow minded limitations of licenses prevent wide spread distribution.<br>
<p>
The IBT would do well to change its policies to support OSS implementations of their technology, they have everything to gain and nothing to loose. <br>

      I fail to see how the licensing agreement quoted makes anybody believe that you can't distribute or develop free software support of Infiniband. Greg K-H's messages make it a little more clear that non-members can be sued, but the article doesn't say that at all.<br>

      If at a later stage patents are included in the standard Free Software cannot fully implement the standard without knowingly infringing patents. Is that the problem?<br>

      <p>Looks like the InfiniBand Trade Association reacted.
<p>Today, I was able to download the latest version 1.2 of the InfiniBand specification <a href="http://www.infinibandta.org/specs">here</a> after a simple name and email registration. I did not have to sign any licence, nor did the specification itself contain anything beyond a copyright statement.

      That's good for the trade secret / NDA aspect but the potential patent<br>

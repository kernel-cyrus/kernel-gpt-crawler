           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>October 4, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2023-Linux_Security_Summit_Europe">LSSEU</a>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/740157/">eBPF in-kernel virtual machine</a> is
approaching its tenth anniversary as part of Linux; it has grown into a
tool with many types of uses in the ecosystem.  Alexei Starovoitov, who
was the creator of eBPF and did much of the development of it, especially
in the early going, gave the opening talk at
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-europe/">Linux
Security Summit Europe</a>&nbsp;2023 on the relationship between BPF and
security.  In it, he related some interesting history, from a somewhat
different perspective than what is often described, he said. Among other
things, it shows how BPF
has been both a security problem and a security solution along the way.
</p>

<h4>Universal assembly</h4>

<p>
BPF is something like the vi editor, Starovoitov began, people either love it or
they hate it, but both are simply sequences of commands.  There are lots of
definitions of BPF, but the one he wanted to use for the talk is that it is
"a universal assembly language".  It is the first strictly typed assembly
language;  there is no "pointer to memory" in BPF, all pointers are to
specific types.
</p>

<p>
Because it is universal, it goes way beyond the use case of user space
telling the kernel what to do; there are now hardware devices that send BPF
to the kernel to describe how to use them. There are also
user-space-to-user-space applications where the kernel is not involved at
all; one application is telling another, perhaps on the other side of the
world, what to do.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/946563/">

align="left" alt="[Alexei Starovoitov]" title="Alexei Starovoitov"
width=244 height=270>
</a>

<p>
He is often asked about the difference between BPF and <a
href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>.  BPF is not a sandboxed
environment like WebAssembly or JavaScript in a browser; sandboxed
environments do not know what code they are going to run so they have to
restrict the execution environment.  They create a boundary, but that slows
down the performance due to all of the run-time checks.
</p>

<p>
BPF, instead, is statically verified so there are "practically no run-time
checks"; the only checks are for things that the verifier cannot statically
determine.  The major difference is that the intent of a BPF program is
known before it is executed, which is not at all the same for sandboxes,
which have to run arbitrary code.  He often sees comments (on LWN in
particular) about adding WebAssembly to the kernel; his response is that
those developers should "bring it in".  He believes there is enough room in
the kernel 
for WebAssembly or some other sandbox environment in addition to BPF.
</p>

<p>
When eBPF was first proposed in&nbsp;2013, it was called "internal BPF" (iBPF);
it eventually moved to "extended BPF", thus eBPF.  In addition, eBPF has
itself been extended multiple times; in LLVM, these newer instruction sets
are different CPU models that are selected with the <tt>&#8209;mcpu</tt>
option using values <tt>v1</tt> to <tt>v4</tt>.  The <tt>v4</tt> support
was added in July&nbsp;2023; it is the instruction set that GCC now also supports.
</p>

<p>
Starovoitov said that his next slide (number&nbsp;9 in his 
<a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/linuxsecuritysummiteurope20/5a/bpf_and_security.pdf">slides</a>)
was the most important one in his presentation.  Each project should have a
mission statement, he said. BPF has two parts to its mission, first,
"innovate" and, second, "enable others to innovate".  The project continues
to satisfy his "thirst for innovation", but it also enables others to do
new things.  One of his favorite parts of working on BPF is helping people
who post on the mailing list with something new they are trying to do; that
is "the best moment of being a kernel maintainer".
</p>

<p>
He thinks that attitude for the project shows in the growth of the BPF
development community within the kernel.  He displayed a graph of unique
developers by month since the beginning of&nbsp;2019, which shows a general rise
from around&nbsp;50 to well over&nbsp;100 in that span, while the BPF team at Meta,
which he is part of, has been fairly flat at around ten or fifteen
developers over that same span.
</p>

<h4>Tracing and networking</h4>

<p>
"BPF has roots in tracing", he said.  The first hook that an eBPF program
could be attached to was
for kprobes and uprobes; tracepoints came next, then function entry
(fentry) and exit (fexit).  People often think that BPF can do anything
within the kernel, but it is actually quite restricted.  For tracepoints,
the BPF program can read any kernel data, but it cannot modify it at all.
Networking BPF programs can read and modify the packet data and drop
packets, but they cannot modify the kernel state. The restrictions on what various types of BPF programs can do are based on
the use cases for those programs.
</p>

<p>
He gave some examples of BPF tracing.
Android uses BPF programs
to track network usage based on the contacted host, he said.  So if a user
wants to 
see their Facebook use on their phone versus YouTube use, say, they are
getting that 
information by way of a BPF program.  The <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples/cpp/pyperf">PyPerf</a>
program uses BPF to profile Python programs.  Beyond that, BPF programs can be
attached to user-space programs using uprobes such that any invocation of a
program will have the BPF program attached.  That can be used to see how
much time GCC spends processing include files versus compiling the code;
each invocation of GCC in a parallel make will be instrumented correctly to
gather that data.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple networking use cases for BPF as well.  He noted that the
<a href="/Articles/750845/">express data path</a> (XDP) feature of the
kernel came about as a way to fend 
off distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.  At one point, Facebook
was under a DDoS attack of&nbsp;500Gbps that was mitigated by putting a BPF
program at the network-driver level using XDP.  Absorbing the attack that
way provided a&nbsp;10x improvement over earlier DDoS-mitigation techniques, he said.
</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>
The ability to <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/prog_lsm.html">attach
BPF programs to Linux security
module (LSM) hooks</a> (also known as BPF-LSM) is a recent addition to the
kernel that is being 
used to "prevent interesting security attacks", Starovoitov said.  As with other BPF
program types, the BPF programs that can be attached to LSM hooks (or to
system calls) have specific capabilities that are different from those of
tracing, networking, or other program types.  Those programs can read
arbitrary kernel data and deny operations, but they can also sleep, which
is something new for BPF programs.  That means the program can cause a
minor fault if the user-space address it is accessing has been swapped out,
so it is not possible to evade these hooks by referring to swapped-out memory.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the BPF-LSM programs are generally not publicly available, unlike
those for, say, tracing and networking.  At least&nbsp;90% of the programs that
he knows about in those realms are freely available; in particular, many of
the large internet companies are working together on things like DDoS
protection, sharing their code, and learning from each other.  The same is
true in tracing, but the story for BPF-LSM code "is not that good"
</p>

<p>
The BPF feature set for networking, tracing, and, even, security is pretty
much set at this point; they are&nbsp;95% done, though, of course, the last&nbsp;5%
takes lots more time, he said. But there are still new things being added
to BPF, including the recently landed <a
href="/Articles/909109/">BPF for human interface device</a> (HID) feature.
This allows BPF programs to modify how HID devices, such as keyboards and
mice, are seen by the kernel, to correct problems (quirks) or change
the behavior in some way.
</p>

<p>
Starovoitov said that he is excited about the <a
href="/Articles/922405/">extensible scheduler class</a> that would allow
BPF programs to perform scheduling functions in order to test out new
scheduling algorithms.  There are always niche use cases where a
more-specialized scheduler is needed, especially in cloud workloads where
the schedulers in the virtual machines end up fighting with the hypervisor
scheduler. So far, at least, pluggable scheduling using BPF has <a
href="/Articles/939332/">been rejected</a>, though that was not mentioned
in the talk.
</p>

<h4>Unprivileged BPF</h4>

<p>
The original Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) instruction set was created&nbsp;30
years ago; it lives on in Linux as "classic BPF" (cBPF) and is used by
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tcpdump.1.html"><tt>tcpdump</tt></a>
and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>.
Uses of cBPF are unprivileged, so eBPF followed suit: two of the&nbsp;32 BPF
program types can be used without privileges, and both only allow reading
packet data and dropping packets.  One of those,
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</tt>, has been completely unused, he said;
all of the other program types always required root privileges.
</p>

<p>
That was fine for the first few years of eBPF's existence in the
kernel, he said—until&nbsp;2017.  That was when Jann Horn of <a
href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/about-project-zero.html">Project
Zero</a> wrote <a
href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html">some
BPF code that demonstrated speculative-execution problems</a>, which
eventually became known as Spectre v1.  Modern CPUs all do speculative
execution, but the side effects of their mispredictions still remain in
the caches, so they cannot be hidden.  As was seen at the end of&nbsp;2017 (and
in the years since), those side effects can be turned into security
vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<p>
The hardware vendors response to these problems was to recommend that any
possible branch mispredictions be stopped by adding "load fence"
(<tt>lfence</tt>) instructions throughout the code.  Microsoft followed this advice
and changed its compilers to emit those instructions all over the place;
Windows and other tools were then rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
The hardware vendors requested that the Linux kernel do the same, but
kernel developers had other ideas, he said.  The <tt>lfence</tt> instruction is a
big hammer, 
with major performance implications, so it was decided that the kernel
would manage speculation by steering it in safe directions rather than turning
it off with <tt>lfence</tt>. It took a lot of work to convince Intel and Arm that
the technique was feasible, but it resulted in a <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f3804203306e098dae9ca51540fcd5eb700d7f40">better
fix for the problem</a>. The <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> macro from that
patch is used&nbsp;240 times in the kernel today, some of them in extremely hot
paths, such as looking up indexes in the file-descriptor table.  The impact
of using <tt>lfence</tt> instructions instead would have been huge.
</p>

<p>
BPF was used in Horn's exploit, so changes were needed there as well.  BPF
cannot use the macro directly, but it makes an equivalent change to avoid
Spectre 
v1.  Only a few months later, though, Horn came back with a Spectre v2 exploit
that used the BPF interpreter, which caused some additional concern about
the security story for BPF.  The exploit
was not actually loading BPF code into the kernel; the speculative execution was
using the interpreter on BPF instructions that lived in user space.
</p>

<p>
The solution was to avoid having the interpreter code in the kernel
executable.  BPF code can either be interpreted or run with the
just-in-time (JIT) compiler, 
so the <tt>BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON</tt> option was added to always
enable the compiler for BPF and remove the interpreter.
While
BPF was changed to avoid this problem (which is, of course, really in the
CPU hardware), he believes that any interpreter in the
kernel could be used in this way; there are at least three other
interpreters, so the kernel is still not fully safe, Starovoitov said.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting how the perception of the BPF JIT compiler has changed
over the 
years, he said.  In&nbsp;2011, there was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIT_spraying">JIT spraying</a> attack
against it, which made some kernel developers wonder whether JIT
compilation had any 
place in the kernel.  That problem was addressed at the time, but now the
JIT compiler has to be enabled to 
avoid Spectre v2.  The BPF developers have also found that the JIT compiler
recovers 
performance 
that was lost to <a
href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">retpolines</a>, which
are another Spectre v2 mitigation.
</p>

<p>
In&nbsp;2019, the BPF developers decided to get smarter with the verifier to
avoid other speculative-execution problems.  Daniel Borkmann worked on <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=979d63d50c0c0f7bc537bf821e056cc9fe5abd38">verifier
changes</a> to detect and avoid these problems.  To do so, the verifier
simulates both normal and speculative execution, which is "unique in the
industry, no other static-analysis tool can do this kind of speculative
analysis". 
</p>

<p>
Along came Spectre v4, which was mitigated with a handful of lines of code
in the verifier to sanitize the stack.  But other Spectre variants kept
showing up, so it was 
eventually decided to add a configuration option to disable unprivileged
BPF completely.  The two program types that could be used without
privileges were "extremely niche use cases with a number of users less than
the number of fingers on a hand"; it simply was not worth the continued
pain to the BPF community to keep trying to support that feature, Starovoitov said.
The <tt>BPF_UNPRIV_DEFAULT_OFF</tt> option defaults to "on" so that
distributions do not allow unprivileged BPF programs, though administrators
can override that choice.
</p>

<h4><tt>CAP_BPF</tt></h4>

<p>
Over the years, there were persistent calls to split out some BPF
permissions from the root privileges (actually <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>)
needed to perform nearly all BPF actions.   The <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt>
capability was added by the perf subsystem, but it has been adopted by BPF
as well; it allows reading kernel memory.  The <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability
was added to govern various types of BPF operations; it can be combined
with <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt> to allow loading useful tracing programs or with
<tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt> to allow loading useful networking programs—either
without 
requiring <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
There is a perception problem with <tt>CAP_BPF</tt>, however, he said; it
is not clear what it is actually meant to govern.  Part of the problem is
that BPF is not constrained by namespaces; if you can look at kernel
memory, you can look at all of kernel memory, not just that in a single
container. <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> is meant to work like <tt>CAP_SYS_MODULE</tt>,
which is the 
capability required to load a kernel module; that capability effectively gives
permission to crash the kernel because malicious (or buggy) modules can do
just that.
</p>

<p>
But verifier bugs can lead to BPF programs crashing the kernel, which
should be expected as a possibility, but is treated as a security hole
instead, Starovoitov said.  So every verifier bug gets a CVE, which is a real
problem.  He noted a mid-September <a href="/Articles/944209/">LWN
article</a> on the topic of "bogus CVEs", which is a problem for the
BPF project as well.  Bugs are fixed, but get CVEs filed for earlier kernel
versions where backports have not been made; sometimes those CVEs even
reference 
the self-test code that BPF runs to ensure the bug remains fixed.  The
existence of a CVE then creates a panic to fix the older kernel.
</p>

<p>
Some security startups are using BPF in strange ways.  He noted one unnamed
startup that complained about what BPF can do and the dangers to
systems 
inherent in the existence BPF; that was all done to sell the startup's
product, of 
course.  The strange piece is that the product was using BPF to protect
against all of the BPF problems it was railing against. "In the end, they were
saying 'BPF is bad, use BPF to protect from BPF'."
</p>

<p>
He began running short of time, so he started quickly moving through the
rest of his talk.  He noted that one of the few BPF-LSM programs that is
open source is one that is used by systemd to prevent the mounting of
filesystem types based on allow and deny lists. He showed a few other
examples of how systemd is using BPF to enforce various
security policies. In some cases, it is using the BPF-LSM hooks, but in
others it is using other BPF program types (e.g. networking and tracing) to
do its job.
</p>

<p>
Starovoitov said that he believes all kernel modules should really be
written as BPF 
programs.  The advantages of kernel modules is that they can be written as
arbitrary C code, with full access to the kernel's symbols, but that means
they can also crash the kernel due to a bug.  For BPF programs, safety is
built into them via the verifier.  In addition, BPF programs are more
portable than kernel modules.  That portability is an underestimated advantage,
especially for companies with large fleets of systems, some long tail of
which will have a variety of different kernel versions.
</p>

<p>
He closed with a quick note that he thinks the version of C that is used by
BPF is a better version of C for kernel programming.  The safety that has
been built into the flavor of C that can be verified is a better choice for
kernel programming overall.  His slides showed a few buggy constructs that
could be avoided, but he was not able to get into any of the details,
though some were <a href="/Articles/909095/">mentioned in a talk</a> from a
year ago.  One
suspects that may not be an opinion that is widely held outside of the BPF
community—at least yet.

      This is inconsistent.
"Unprivileged" BPF programs can crash the kernel -- and this <em>isn't</em> a security bug?
<p>Either those programs are, in fact, privileged, or the fact they can crash the kernel <em>is</em> a security bug. (Unless the bug is one that's only exploitable by privileged programs, I suppose.)<p>
It might be a consistent position to say "these programs can crash the kernel, but they don't have all these other permissions that BPF programs have." But (a) this isn't the documented position, and (b) it would be a fairly strange position to justify.

What BPF program can crash the kernel?  TFA claims that can only happen if there is a bug in the verifier (which is treated as a security bug).<br>

Why is it a security bug if you can crash the kernel? a dead system cant be attacked any further. Sure its a denial of service, but that isnt a _security_ issue<br>

I'm not sure that "root can crash the kernel" is actually a security issue.<br>
<p>
I think the crux is the sentence "CAP_BPF is meant to work like CAP_SYS_MODULE, which is the capability required to load a kernel module; that capability effectively gives permission to crash the kernel because malicious (or buggy) modules can do just that."<br>

      Security fundamentals are often considered to be Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.  Crashing the kernel would be considered an Availability security issue.

I agree, especially since the impact of a verifier bug is much more likely to be arbitrary code execution or information leak, not just denial of service.<br>
<p>
Either the eBPF verifier is a security boundary or it isn’t.  If it is, then malicious eBPF programs exploiting the kernel is a security hole.  If it is not, then lockdown should block in-kernel eBPF programs that cannot be authenticated by the kernel, just as it blocks loading of unsigned modules.  Anything else is inconsistent and confusing.<br>
<p>
(Classic BPF is unquestionably a security boundary, since it is used by seccomp-BPF which requires no privileges.  That’s not what is being discussed here, though.)<br>

I'm a bit confused by these two statements:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Uses of cBPF are unprivileged</span><br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; But other Spectre variants kept showing up, so it was eventually decided to add a configuration option to disable unprivileged BPF completely</span><br>
<p>
Is this saying that on modern kernels, BPF requires privilege to be used, even though BPF itself doesn't use any privileges?<br>

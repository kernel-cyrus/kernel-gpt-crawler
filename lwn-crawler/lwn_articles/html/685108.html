In one of just a handful of filesystem-only sessions at the 2016 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Al Viro reported on work
he has done to allow VFS lookups to proceed in parallel.  Today, all
directory operations are done with the inode mutex (<tt>i_mutex</tt>) held,
which prevents anything else from touching that directory.  But the most
common operation, lookup, is non-destructive, so there is no real
conceptual reason to stop it from happening in parallel.  Solving that
scalability problem took some work, though, as Viro described.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The obvious choice to replace the mutex is a read/write semaphore (rwsem),
Viro said.  But there is a problem: the mutex currently protects the
directory entry (dentry).  A lookup operation can cause dentries to be
created, which can lead to races if two dentries are created for the same name.
Unwinding that took some effort, he said.  There
is a need to ensure that there are never two hashed dentries with the same
parent 
and name at the same time.  If that were to happen, subsequent lookups
would only find one or the other, which must be avoided.  If two lookups on
the same name in the same directory run in parallel, there is a danger that
these two dentries would be created.
</p>

<p>
There was a need for an object that would be used to indicate that a lookup
was in progress 
for a given parent and name.  When a dentry is not found in the
dentry cache, a new dentry is created to be passed to the filesystem
<tt>lookup()</tt> function.  That dentry is the obvious place to track a
lookup in progress for the given parent and name.  There are some fields
that are unused at that point, so they can be repurposed for lookup tracking.
</p>

<p>
These in-progress lookup dentries are tracked in a hash on the
parent.  That hash can't be bigger than the number of in-progress lookups
for that directory.
If a lookup finds an entry on the parent's hash for the same name, it
simply waits until the earlier lookup is done.  So there are no parallel
lookups for the same parent/name combination.
</p>

<p>
His "lookups" branch that implements parallel lookups "actually works",
Viro said.  <tt>i_mutex</tt> is replaced with <tt>i_rwsem</tt> and lookups
are done using that shared lock.  
</p>

<p>
For <tt>readdir()</tt>, a different choice was made.  Because there is state
associated with <tt>readdir()</tt> (i.e. directory position), it doesn't
really make sense to allow two threads to 
be calling <tt>getdents()</tt> on the same directory file descriptor in
parallel.  The <tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt> 
that represents the open directory file has a lock that prevents
<tt>read()</tt> and 
<tt>lseek()</tt> from happening in parallel; it is used to prevent parallel
<tt>readdir()</tt>/<tt>getdents()</tt> calls.
</p>

<p>
One problem that he ran into when converting to an rwsem is a lack of
<a href="/Articles/288056/">"killable" variants</a> of the semaphore
primitives (like 
<tt>down_write()</tt>).  There is a patch series floating around that adds
<tt>down_write_killable()</tt>, but it has not stabilized yet so, for now,
he replaced <tt>mutex_lock_killable()</tt> calls with
<tt>down_write()</tt>, which is fine for testing purposes.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara asked about the performance of the semaphore.  Viro said that
there have 
been no performance regressions that he has seen on the tests he runs.  But
read/write semaphores are a bit costlier.  Kara was concerned that all
lookups are paying the cost of the semaphore, when only some lookups get
the benefit of parallelism.  Hugh Dickins said that a lot of effort has
been put into improving the performance of the semaphore, so the differences
should be minimal.

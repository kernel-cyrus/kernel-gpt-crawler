<p>
In a session at the 2023 Real Time Linux Summit, Thomas Gleixner answered
questions about the realtime feature of the kernel, its status, and the <a
href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/start">Real-Time Linux</a>
project's plans for the future.  The talk was billed as a "Q&amp;A about
<tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>" with a caveat: "anything except <tt>printk()</tt> and
documentation".  As might be guessed, the first two questions were on just
those topics, but there were plenty of other questions (and answers) too.
The summit was 
held in conjunction with the inaugural <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/embedded-open-source-summit/">Embedded
Open Source Summit</a> in Prague, Czechia at the end of June.
</p>

<h4>Documentation and <tt>printk()</tt></h4>

<p>
Right at the start of the session, Steven Rostedt could not
resist asking: "what's wrong with documentation?"  That was met with a big
laugh from Gleixner; "lots", he said.  The biggest problem with
documentation "is that it mostly doesn't exist" for realtime Linux.  His
<tt>printk()</tt> caveat was because the usual question is "when will it be
done?", but that is "subject to crystal balls".  He would be happy to
answer <a href="/Articles/909980/">technical questions about "why <tt>printk()</tt> is a horror-show"</a>.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/938411/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2023/rtls-gleixner-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"
alt="[Thomas Gleixner]" title="Thomas Gleixner" width=221 height=280>
</a>

<p>
With that, he advanced to his second (and final) slide: "Questions?", which
elicited a big laugh from the audience.  Tim Bird asked the next
question, inevitably on the second "off-limits" topic: "is
<tt>printk()</tt> okay if 
you are not 
using a serial 
console?"  Gleixner said "no ... I mean, kind of"; there were some problems
in the <tt>printk()</tt> core, aside from using consoles, that made it
unsuitable to use with the realtime patches.  Those have been fixed, but
there are still the problems with using the console driver.  Those problems
are not truly realtime-specific, but running the kernel with a realtime
configuration makes them even more 
obvious. 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>printk()</tt> code contains a large amount of duct tape, he said,
which is a pattern that the realtime developers have encountered in multiple
parts of the kernel along the way.  For example, the <a
href="/Articles/537562/">CPU hotplug code was 
in a
similar position</a>; everyone knew that the code was broken from a
design perspective.  Instead of fixing the design problems, more and more
duct tape and ... other stuff ... has been added in, to the point where it
"slowly composts into concrete, but it doesn't work".  Eventually, "you
have to bite the bullet and rewrite it". 
</p>

<p>
Bird said that he had looked at the realtime patches recently, noting
that there are around&nbsp;80 of them scattered around the kernel, though
mostly related to the serial console, with only
about&nbsp;4000 lines of code.  He has been telling people that most of it
is now upstream and that they do not have to apply the patches; "is that
correct?"  Gleixner had an initial one-word answer for that: "no".
</p>

<p>
You still cannot enable realtime on the mainline kernel due to the lack of
the "<tt>printk()</tt> bits and pieces"; the other patches in the set are for
things that can be disabled, so those are not required.  Once the threaded
<tt>printk()</tt> patches hit the mainline, then it will be time to ask
Linus Torvalds to enable realtime for x86 and arm64.  The problems with
<tt>printk()</tt> have been solved, he said, according to John Ogness, who
has been working on the code, and <tt>printk()</tt> maintainer Petr
Mladek. "I will believe it once it hits upstream", Gleixner said.
</p>

<h4>THP and networking</h4>

<p>
An attendee asked about transparent huge page (THP) support; currently, it
is disabled when <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> is chosen.  He wondered if there is
something that can be done about that.  Gleixner said that the problems
with THP for realtime need to be fixed, "patches welcome".  The realtime
project has been focused on getting other things done, and has not tackled
THP yet.  There is no technical reason why the two cannot work together,
they just 
do not right now.  The THP migration and coalescing for memory have
unacceptable latencies for the realtime kernel.
</p>

<p>
The attendee mentioned the advantages of reduced translation lookaside
buffer (TLB) pressure that come with THP, which Gleixner acknowledged, but
said that the project needed to prioritize getting the core of the patch
set into the mainline.  There is nothing stopping others from doing that
work (or hiring a consulting company to do so); the project will probably
look into it at some point in the future, but it would be better if others
who need the
feature take it on now.
</p>

<p>
The priority of the software interrupts was the subject of a second
question from 
the attendee; he wondered if their priority could be increased for the
realtime kernel.  Gleixner said that the priorities should be set from user
space by the administrator, based on the needs of the system as a whole.
The problem is that "software interrupts are semantically ill-defined", so
the priority that might work for one application would be totally wrong for
another.  Those interrupts are "context stealing and not really
controllable"; the network developers have defended using software
interrupts "tooth and nail for a decade", but they have come around to the
idea that they need to rethink that, he said.
</p>

<p>
The attendee said that currently networking is basically broken for
realtime processes; but Gleixner said that it was a complaint "about facts
that have been well-known for years".  Once again, he wondered why people
were simply complaining, rather than digging in and working on the problem.
</p>

<p>
Another attendee noted that you can switch the NAPI thread to a realtime
priority using sysfs.  Gleixner said that the networking developers are
moving to a <a href="/Articles/833840/">threaded NAPI</a> right now, which
solves a lot of the problem for realtime, but not all of it.  There are
still lots of bottom-half disables within the networking code, but those
can be removed once networking fully switches to threaded NAPI. 
</p>

<p>
He likened the local bottom-half disable
(i.e. <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt>), which prevent software interrupts from
running, 
to the big kernel lock (BKL). Though it is a per-CPU lock, it is completely
unspecified what <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> protects, just like the BKL.
And, as with the BKL, removing those calls breaks things, "but you couldn't
tell why".
</p>

<p>
The process of removing the BKL was useful, in that regard, because it
allowed the kernel developers to figure out what it was protecting
everywhere within the kernel, with one exception: the TTY layer.  That
brought up a question about the TTY layer and the realtime patches. It
turned out that the attendee really wanted to be able to use all of the
UART devices available in the kernel, but the only path
to those devices right now is via the TTY layer.  
</p>

<h4>Toast and TTYs</h4>

<p>
"If you go through TTY, you're toast", Gleixner said. "Good luck fixing the
TTY layer", he continued; he would not be "touching that with a
ten-foot pole, even if you pay me money".  If there is a need for serial
communication from realtime processes, then some other mechanism needs to
be added because TTY "is unfixable" for realtime.
</p>

<p>
The attendee said that they were not sending much data via the serial
device, but Gleixner said that did not matter; if the only code path to
access the device is via the TTY layer, then "you have a problem".  If
there is a real use case for non-TTY access to these devices, then some
other code path could be added; the attendee agreed that his use case has
nothing to do with TTY.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the questioner said that he has been maintaining an out-of-tree
UART driver since the Linux&nbsp;1.2 days, but it relies on a particular
chip, which may not continue to be available.  Gleixner said that a problem
known since 1.2, which was released nearly&nbsp;30 years ago, seems like it
should have been fixed long ago by working with the upstream kernel
developers on a proper solution.  There is already support for so many
different kinds of oddball devices, adding another should not pose much of
a problem, given that there is a use case for it and a reason why the TTY
layer needs to be bypassed. 
</p>

<p>
A question about a return of the i915 (Intel graphics) driver brought
laughter from 
Gleixner and much of the room.  It is apparently disabled for realtime
kernels.  The only way to get a driver for that hardware is to wait for the
new driver that is under development, Gleixner said.  The current
driver is 
not fixable and the patches that are in the realtime tree "are extremely
horrible"; perhaps they could eventually be merged,  but it will have to
come later, and he seemed skeptical about it even then. 
</p>

<p>
Some of the locking code paths in the existing i915 driver "are completely
homebrew and out of any rational locking scheme in the world".  That is one
of the reasons that the new driver is being developed; "the replacement
driver stack is coming along, you just have to wait for it".  It is another
example of "train wrecks in the kernel" that the realtime developers have
tried to fix along the way. 
</p>

<h4>Things to avoid</h4>

<p>
An attendee asked if there was a list of things to avoid using with the
realtime patches beyond the TTY layer and i915 driver that had already been
mentioned. Gleixner said that i915 actually works with the "hacky patches"
in the realtime tree, at least "by some definition of 'works'".  But using
the TTY layer from a realtime task should surely be avoided; you can call
<tt>printf()</tt> from your highest priority task, but it probably is not the
best idea.  Doing I/O from a realtime task is not generally the right design.
</p>

<p>
The questioner wondered about filesystems; are they problematic when running
the realtime kernel?  Gleixner said that he has not seen any problems with
filesystems for a long time.  Daniel Bristot de Oliveira said that he had
seen lengthy latencies due to Btrfs recently, but Gleixner was not aware of
those reports.  It is the case that other kernel developers can always
"needlessly slap a 
<tt>preempt_disable()</tt> somewhere in their code"; those kinds of
problems need to be tracked down and the developers have to be asked not to
do that.  It is part of why he is "urgently needing to find the cycles to
complete the 'Kernel Developers Guide to RT'"; once that is done, the
realtime developers can point other kernel hackers at it.
</p>

<p>
But filesystems largely stay out of the way, because they are not part of
the realtime computation, he said; "if you write your logfile from your
realtime task, fine, you asked for it ... if the disk stalls, you wait".
What about an in-memory filesystem of some sort, he was asked.  Gleixner
said that might work, "but, seriously, don't do it".  Doing so violates all
of the principles of realtime, he said; that is not a Linux-specific
problem as all of the different realtime operating systems will warn people
away from <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>read()</tt>, and the like.
</p>

<p>
A realtime program should either read its data up front or, if it needs to
continuously update the data, have another, non-realtime process with large
buffers to do the reading, he said.  If the realtime task needs to write
data continuously, it should be written to a ring buffer that a separate
non-realtime task writes out.  That is basic realtime theory, which is not
at all 
Linux-specific, he said.
</p>

<p>
There are systems that need to handle streaming data in realtime, from
cameras for example, an attendee said; how should something like that be
done?  "That's a system-design problem", Gleixner said; you will need a
dedicated network queue, for example, but there is no "general recipe how
to make that work".  The current networking code does not work all that
well with realtime, but a system can be tuned to the point where it can
handle high-speed, streaming data.  There are also options for
handling the network traffic in user space to avoid some of the problems
with realtime and the current networking code.
</p>

<h4>Long journey</h4>

<p>
Bird asked about the <a href="/Articles/885903/">Intel acquisition of
Linutronix</a>, which employs Gleixner and some of the other realtime
developers; he wondered if Intel was now funding work on realtime Linux.
Gleixner said that Intel had always helped fund the realtime work via
the Real-Time Linux project; both Intel and Arm have an interest in
realtime Linux, which is reflected in their project membership.  Kate
Stewart, Linux Foundation VP for Dependable Embedded Systems and the
organizer of the project, said that Intel, Arm, TI, National Instruments,
Red Hat, and <a
href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/rtl/members">others</a>
have all been part of the "long journey" to get the 
full realtime patch set into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Rostedt noted that the long journey would be&nbsp;20 years in 2024, but
Gleixner said that was only the public part of the journey.  It was first
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/105948/">posted to the Linux kernel
mailing list</a> in 2004, but for him the journey 
started at the end of 1999.  That means it will be&nbsp;25 years for him
since the beginning of the project; "it's a long journey and there are a
lot of things we need to address and improve over time", though there is
"only so much capacity".  He has tried working day and night, but has found
that "it doesn't make things more effective". 
</p>

<p>
The final question was about the role of the <a
href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/cyclictest/start">cyclictest</a>
tool; is it a good reference application?  Gleixner said that cyclictest is
useful for testing, but that it does not 
"resemble any particular real-world application".  The questioner wondered
if there were any good examples of real-world applications that could be
reviewed.  Gleixner said that he did not know of one, but that cyclictest
and other test/benchmarking applications do provide a kind of basic reference
implementation; however, real-world applications have a wide variety of
requirements and levels of complexity.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem with coming up with a reference realtime application is
the need for specialized hardware, Gleixner said.  That is a difficulty for
testing and benchmarking realtime systems, he said; the results are
effectively not reproducible without access to the same hardware.  It is
particularly hard to integrate such a test into continuous-integration
(CI) systems.  There is infrastructure that allows people running CI or
other tests on their hardware to report it back to the realtime project,
which can 
help detect and find regressions and other bugs.  With that, Gleixner noted
that he was no longer standing between attendees and the bar (or other
evening activities), and the 2023 Real Time Linux Summit was complete.

GRsecurity maintained large patches outside upstream and it took a few years to get most of them merged upstream, no? I don't know how many years, but it seems like it's still a work-in-progress 😁<br>

I've seen a few last around 10-15 years. Reiser4 and BFQ come to mind.<br>
<p>
Those are bolt-on features in a framework designed for pluggable drivers though. RT is a fundamental rework of the kernel to make it do things beyond what it's designed/allowed to do, in hostile environments (cpu scheduler code, a burnout graveyard for enthusiastic hackers), *and* it's survived several major eras in kernel development (not just the major version numbers, but the BKL, and the state of the early-2000s LKML besides).<br>
<p>
It's a statistical miracle that this project has gotten this far. It deserves respect for that.<br>

The mentioned out of tree project which required special chip level of support at UART chips level is uLAN RS-486 protocol <a href="https://ulan.sourceforge.net/">https://ulan.sourceforge.net/</a> which use in our instruments predates Linux. The actual driver uses single source for DOS, Linux, Windows, NuttX and system-less bare metal application. API is and C level compatible even with assembly driver for 8051 chips. C driver is usable for ISA, PCI, PCIe and USB HW but with limited range of chips.<br>
<p>
It would be great to integrate code into mainline Linux, but it would require complete rewrite to get rid of all compatibility with old kernels and other systems and I have minimal resources to investment into rewrite. I have no personal income  from this project for its whole existence even that others use it to obtain funding from European Union. And our main area of investment into laboratory instruments has been used by others often without paying the penny as well.<br>
<p>
So I focus to CAN/CAN FD where we strive to go into Linux, NuttX, QEMU, RTEMS mainline with or even more without funding, because this is area where broader community would profit.<br>
<p>
As for the TTY layer based project, we have implemented on Volkswagen contract LIN bus solution - slLIN <a href="https://github.com/lin-bus/linux-lin">https://github.com/lin-bus/linux-lin</a>  which I try to maintain usable for others, again mostly in my spare time when I do not teach <a href="https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/">https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/</a>  nor do work on or company motion control systems and other solution for partner companies and even ESA now...<br>

Even that discussion confirmed that networking in its current form is not more suitable for areas requiring bounded latency than when many years ago, there are were and are applications which need at least some level of time predictability.<br>
<p>
We have restarted our initiative to analyze CAN subsystem latency profiles. This time automated with daily results for mainline and RT-Preempt kernels. The results overview  <a href="https://canbus.pages.fel.cvut.cz/can-latester/">https://canbus.pages.fel.cvut.cz/can-latester/</a> with option to switch to detailed insect for individual loads and kernel variants. Actual tests are running on AMD/Xilinx Zynq based MZ_APO educational kits with our own CTU CAN FD IP cores. But device under the test can be replaced easily, there are no specific needs, only two CAN or better CAN FD interfaces are required. The monitoring and traffic generation system needs precise time-stamping  in addition, CTU CAN FD offers 10 ns resolution with common time-base used for four controllers in the given configuration.<br>
<p>
The project is part of our CAN/CAN FD support investments into GNU/Linux, NuttX, RTEMS, QEMU... Page with links to some of the efforts including CAN FD IP core project  there  <a href="https://canbus.pages.fel.cvut.cz/">https://canbus.pages.fel.cvut.cz/</a> .

Wouldn't networking with bounded latency require circuit switching instead of packet switching?<br>

Presumably why they mentioned CAN. CAN has prioritisation. High priority node can always transmit, and collision resolution is bounded, via synchronisation. Assuming you have some bound on higher-priority nodes, that should let you have bounded latency on all nodes. Not switched though.<br>

But CAN protocol goes through full networking packets SHB machinery in the case of the SocketCAN implementation. Simple character drivers provided less comfort but has not been dependent on soft-irq mess. There the light on the tunnel end now, the individual NAPI real threads per interface. So may it be, we will se improvement in our tests over years.<br>
<p>
Another problem is that most SocketCAN drivers provide only single FIFO Tx queue and when message from its head is the only one participating in arbitration then classical priority inversion is inevitable. So there is really large space to improve situation. CTU CAN FD IP core is prepared for that because it allows to change order of messages participating in Tx arbitration without need to request stop attempts to succeed on the bus for the current one. This setup allows to maintain virtual multiple FIFO queues. Then the head messages witch highest priority specify from which queues are messages pushed into HW Tx buffers and if FIFO with higher priority appears then the messages in HW Tx buffers can be rescheduled.<br>
<p>
But that would be long way for SockeCAN and even our driver to get there. We probably test that approach during our planned bring-up of CAN FD support in RTEMS.org which is much smaller RTOS and we have possibility to introduce more principal changes in shorter time.<br>

Zephyr has CAN support. But I have no own experience with Zephyr. In the past, I did not like approach of integration of the MCU support based on the layers specific to individual chip producers. NuttX has had much more unified approach. RTEMS lacks broad MCU support but the core and scheduler has been much more durable and scalable and it is prequalified for serious serious space grade missions now. But the precise support targets small number of expensive platforms. Support for Raspbery Pi and others is mainly a toy to allow playing with system on cheap hardware which can lead to core enhancements and or gaining experience to continue in real flight applications with appropriate HW...<br>
<p>
But I agree that Zephyr gains momentum and API refines to real POSIX alternative now.<br>

There seems to be a push to replace CAN with "Automotive Ethernet". Basically, 10Base-T1S for a shared ethernet bus, using a single twisted-pair, with CSMA/CD. "But, doesn't CSMA/CD suck for bounded latency and performance collapse under load?", yes, so they're augmenting CSMA/CD with a "Phy-Level Collision Avoidance Reconciliation Scheme" (PLCA RS). In PLCA-RS the nodes on the ethernet bus are each assigned an ID, the IDs encode a priority (like CAN). The highest priority node (ID 0) sends a BEACON frame that marks the start of an ordered series of "transmission opportunities" - each node uses CSMA/CD access + a local timer to determine when it has a slot to transmit.<br>
<p>
Kind of an adaptive TDMA, without a shared synchronised clock - but nodes still have to run local clocks. <br>

I am not sure if Ethernet prevails in the count of connection in automotive. I agree that for IP based traffic and interconnection of main nodes it can be more straightforward than CAN XL - up to 2 kB frames, full push pull symmetric data phase etc... But is seems that simplicity of CAN and it iterfacing leads to actual increase of CAN FD cores on SoCs, i.e. 14 of these on a single SoC, so I expect that local electronics nests will even more intensively use CAN in future. And there is CAN FD lite which can replace LIN and can be integrated into chips directly as I2C but allows to communicate even out of single PCB.<br>
<p>
By the way, it funny that our uLAN protocol mentioned above provided deterministic arbitration with 11 times lower pulses at arbitration phase (max 64 nodes on the net) with dominant recessive logic and then switched to push-pull data phase and provided priority rotation without tokens or other single point of failure nodes for cases where 16 full time data flood pushing units have been used at given time. All that with commodity HW in 1991 and fully documented and open source without patents costs etc...<br>

Yeah, a bit! Also, as the creator pointed out, it's also definitely /not/ TMDA, cause it's not synchronous - no master clock. There's just synchronisation via the BEACON frame, CSMA/CD, and the local clocks that run to determine the min slot times (hopefully those clocks can't drift too much from each other in the short time they need to be roughly consistent).<br>

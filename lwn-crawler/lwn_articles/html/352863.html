<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 15, 2009</br>
           </div>
Scheduler-related development seems to come in bursts.  Things will be
relatively quiet for a few development cycles, then activity will suddenly
increase.  We would appear to be in one of those periods where developers
start to show a higher level of interest in what the scheduler is doing.
The posting of the BFS scheduler has certainly motivated some of this
activity, but there is more than that going on.
<p>
<h4>Interactivity</h4>
<p>
On the BFS front, the (mildly) inflammatory part of the discussion would
appear to have run its course.  Anybody who has watched the linux-kernel
list knows that serious attempts to fix problems often follow the storm;
that appears to be the case this time around.  Benchmarks are being posted
by a number of people; as a general rule, the results of these benchmark
runs tend to be mixed.  There are also developers and users posting about problems
that they are observing; see, for example, <a href="/Articles/352875/">Jens
Axboe's report</a> of a ten-second pause while trying to run the
<tt>xmodmap</tt> command.
<p>
As part of the process of tracking down problems, the conversation turned
to tuning the scheduler.  Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/352880/">pointed
out</a> that there is a whole set of flags governing scheduler behavior,
all of which can be tweaked by the system administrator:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Note, these flags are all runtime, the new settings take effect
	almost immediately (and at the latest it takes effect when a task
	has started up) and safe to do runtime.  It basically gives us
	32768 pluggable schedulers each with a slightly separate algorithm
	- each setting in essence creates a new scheduler.
</div>
<p>
The idea here is not that each user should be required to pick out the
correct scheduler from a set of 32768 - a number which presumably seems
high even to the "Linux is about choice" crowd.  But these flags can be useful for
anybody who is trying to track down why the behavior of the scheduler is
not as good as it should be.  When a tuning change improves things, it
gives developers a hint about where they should be looking to find the
source of the problem.
<p>
A particular test suggested by Ingo was this:
<p>
<pre>
    echo NO_NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS &gt; /debug/sched_features
</pre>
<p>
(Politically-correct developers will, of course, have debugfs mounted under
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug</tt>.  Your editor takes no position on the proper
debugfs mount point.)
<p>
One tester <a href="/Articles/352889/">reported immediately</a> that
setting this flag made the problems go away.  Jens also noted that his
ten-second <tt>xmodmap</tt> problem was solved.  The evidence of problems
with the NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS feature was compelling enough that Ingo posted
<a href="/Articles/352890/">a patch to disable it by default</a>; that
patch has been merged for 2.6.32.
<p>
For the curious, the NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS feature is a simple tweak which
gives a process a small runtime credit when it returns to the run queue
after a sleep.  It is meant to help interactive processes, but, clearly,
something is not working as expected.  Once the real problem has been
tracked down, it's possible that the NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS feature could, once
again, be enabled by default.  In the mean time, users experiencing
interactivity problems may want to try disabling it and seeing if things
get better.
<p>
<h4>Child-runs-first</h4>
<p>
Another default parameter is changing for 2.6.32; it controls which process
runs first 
after a <tt>fork()</tt>.  For much of the recent past, <tt>fork()</tt> has
arranged things such that the child process gets to run before
<tt>fork()</tt> returns to the parent; this behavior was based on the
general observation that the child's work is often more important.  There
is a good reason to run the parent first, though: the parent's state is
active in the processor, the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) contains
the right information, etc.  So parent-runs-first should perform better.
It appears that recent tests showed that parent-runs-first does, indeed,
outperform child-runs-first on that most important benchmark: kernel builds.  That was
enough to get the default changed.
<p>
There are some concerns that this change could expose application bugs.
Jesper Juhl <a href="/Articles/352906/">expresses those concerns</a> this
way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm just worried that userspace programs have come to rely on a
	certain behaviour and changing that behaviour may result in
	undesired results for some apps.  In a perfect world people would
	just fix those apps that (incorrectly) relied on a certain
	child-/parent-runs-first behaviour, but the world is not perfect,
	and many apps may not even have source available.
</div>
<p>
Child-runs-first has never been a part of the <tt>fork()</tt> API, though;
it's not something that applications should rely on.  Even before the
change, behavior could differ as a result of preemption, SMP systems, and
more.  So it's really true that child-runs-first was never guaranteed.  But
that will not make users feel any better if applications break.  To help
those users, there is a new <tt>kernel.sched_child_runs_first</tt> sysctl
knob; setting it to one will restore the previous behavior.
<p>

<h4>Better cpuidle governance</h4>
<p>
Active CPU scheduling is interesting, but there is also work happening in
another area: what happens when nobody wants the CPU?  Contemporary
processors include a number of power management features which can be used
to reduce power consumption when nothing is going on.
Clearly, anybody who is concerned about power consumption will want the
processor to be in a low-power state whenever possible.  There are,
however, some problems with a naive "go into a low power state when idle"
policy:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Transitions between power states will, themselves, consume power.  
     If a CPU is put into a very low-power state, only to be brought back
     into operation a few microseconds later, the total power consumption
     will increase.
<p>
<li> Power state transitions have a performance cost.  An extreme example
     would be simply pulling the plug altogether; power consumption will be
     admirably low, but the system will experience poor response times that
     not even the BFS scheduler can fix.  Putting the CPU into a more
     conventional low-power state will still create latencies; it takes a
     while for the processor to get back into a working mode.  So going
     into a low-power state too easily will hurt the performance of the
     system. 
</ul>
<p>
It turns out that the CPU "governor" code in the mainline kernel often gets
this decision wrong, especially for the newer Intel "Nehalem" processors;
the result is wasted energy and poor performance, where  "poor
performance"  means a nearly 50% hit on some tests that
Arjan van de Ven ran.  His response was to put together <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/352180/">a patch</a> aimed at fixing the
problems.  The approach taken is interesting.
<p>
Clearly, it makes no sense to put the processor into a low-power state if
it will be brought back to full power in the very near future.  So all the
governor code really has to do is to come up with a convincing prediction
of the future so it knows when the CPU will be needed again.
Unfortunately, the chip vendors have delayed the availability of the
long-promised crystal-ball peripherals yet again, forcing the governor code
to rely on heuristics; once again, software must make up for deficiencies
in the hardware.
<p>
When trying to make a guess about when a CPU might wake up, there are two
things to consider.  One is entirely well known: the time of the next
scheduled timer event.  The timer will put an upper bound on the time that
the CPU might sleep, but it is not a definitive number; interrupts may wake
up the CPU before the timer goes off.  Arjan's governor tries to 
guess when that interrupt might happen by looking at the previous
behavior of the system.  Every time that the processor wakes up, the
governor code calculates the difference between the estimated and actual
idle times.  A running average of that difference is maintained and used
to make a (hopefully) more accurate guess as to what the next idle time
will really be.
<p>
Actually, several running averages are kept.  The probability of a very
long idle stretch being interrupted by an interrupt is rather higher than
the probability when expected idle period is quite short.  So there is a
separate correction factor maintained for each order of magnitude of idle
time - a 1ms estimate will have a different correction factor than a
100&micro;s or a 10ms guess will.  Beyond that, a completely different set
of correction factors is used (and maintained) if there is I/O outstanding
on the current CPU.  If there are processes waiting on short-term (block)
I/O, the chances of an early wakeup are higher.
<p>
The performance concern, meanwhile, is addressed by trying to come up with
some sort of estimate of how badly power-management latency would hurt the
system.  A CPU which is doing very little work will probably cause little
pain if it goes to sleep for a while.  If, instead, the CPU is quite busy,
it's probably better to stay powered up and ready to work.  In an attempt
to quantify "busy," the governor code calculates a "multiplier":
<p>
<pre>
    multiplier = 1 + 20*load_average + 10*iowait_count
</pre>
<p>
All of the numbers are specific to the current CPU.  So the multiplier is
heavily influenced by the system load average, and a bit less so by the
number of processes waiting for I/O.  Or so it seems - but remember that
processes in uninterruptible waits (as are used for block I/O) are counted
in the load average, so their influence is higher than it might seem.  In
summary, this multiplier grows quickly as the number of active processes
increases. 
<p>
The final step is to examine all of the possible sleep states that the
processor provides, starting with the deepest sleep.  Each sleep state has
an associated "exit latency" value, describing how long it takes to get out
of that state; deeper sleeps have higher exit latencies.  The new governor
code multiplies the exit latency by the multiplier calculated above, then
compares the result to its best guess for the idle time.  If that idle time
exceeds the adjusted latency value, that sleep state is chosen.  Given the
large multipliers involved, one can see that expected idle times must get
fairly long fairly quickly as the system load goes up.
<p>
According to Arjan, this change restores performance to something very
close to that of a system which is not using sleep states at all.  The
improvement is significant enough that Arjan would like to see the code
merged for 2.6.32, even though it just appeared during the merge window.
That might happen, though it is possible that it will turned into a
separate CPU governor for one development cycle just in case regressions

<p>
Ah, nostalgia... <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0419/kernel.php3">Here</a> -- scroll down a bit -- the idea to run the child first was introduced, thinking that this would improve performance in many common cases, because it prevented unnecessary COWs when the child would not do very complicated things. Of course, Linus seemed to use lmbench instead of kernel builds. ;-)

Also, ESR released CML2-1.2.0!

Unless things have changed in 8 years, of course.
</i>
<p>
Two fundamental things have changed.
<p>
Firstly, we have an increase in parallelism on the hardware level (more hardware threads, more cores, more sockets) - so pushing child tasks away to other CPUs is generally a good idea.
<p>
Secondly, back then in the 2.4 heydays we also didnt have proper vfork() yet. vfork() will in essence guarantee child-runs-first via an explicit handshake between parent and the exec()-ing child. (regardless of the sysctl_sched_child_runs_first control.) That's faster and more efficient than any heuristics the scheduler can provide in this area.

Erm, the vfork manpage comment "It is rather unfortunate that Linux revived this spectre from the past." isn't very motivating for application developers to use vfork..<br>

I think that the API is faulty here: whether it is forking or sending a message, the application developers know if they would prefer scheduling immediately the child/target process or not, so the API should allow the developer to say what he prefers instead of relying on one global default.<br>

Could be the whole SMP-gone-mainstream thing... ;)<br>
The x86 architecture has gone through some interesting permutations since 2001.<br>
<p>
*sigh* I remember kernel 2.4.4... Wrestling with going from Slink to Potato and ReiserFS in 2.4.6 going haywire... The install discs still have a warm place in my big CD binder of Linux CDs going back to The Linux System Administrator's Survival Guide's Slackware 3.0 pack-in from 1996.<br>
<p>
We've come so far. B-tree filesystems (B+TRee now) are hip again, gentoo's visibly early console/splash work has paved the way for xsplash, 1.6ghz chips have become a hot item again, and we're finally at the point where 256GB SSDs are competing with the 250GB Hard Drives everyone was awestruck with years ago. Good times.<br>

<h1>Virtual time</h1>

The developers interested in containers and virtualization have discussed
interfaces to virtualize access to a number of system resources.  None,
however, have talked about virtualizing access to the system time.  Until
now, that is.  With Jeff Dike's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/179825/">time
virtualization patches</a> any process tree can 
have its own idea of what time it is.
<p>

Jeff's patch adds a new "time namespace" structure to the task structure.
By default, all processes share the normal host system's idea of time.  But
a new option (<tt>CLONE_TIME</tt>) to the <tt>unshare()</tt> system call
allows a process to disconnect from the system time.  After such a call,
that process - and any children it creates - will be able to keep its own
time value.  Setting a virtualized time value is, unlike changing the
normal system time, an unprivileged operation.
<p>

Internally, a virtualized time is stored as a simple offset; whenever a
process requests the current time, the offset is added to the the current
system time and the sum is returned.  This approach has the advantages of
being simple and fast; a process running with virtualized time also does
not give up time adjustments made, for example, by NTP.  On the other hand,
this implementation does not support the ability to confuse processes by
messing deeply with their idea of time - running time at a different rate,
for example, or even backward.  Chances are that this omission will not
upset more than a small percentage of potential users of virtualized time,
however. 
<p>

Jeff's purpose is to speed up the <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> system call in
User-mode Linux instances.  If the kernel allows process subtrees to have
their own time values, then User-mode Linux can simply use the host's
<tt>gettimeofday()</tt> call, rather than intercepting that call and
implementing it itself.  Since <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> is one of the most
frequently-used system calls, this optimization can make a significant
difference. 
<p>

One other change is required, however, for User-mode Linux to get the
benefit from this change.  UML performs much of its process control using
<tt>ptrace()</tt>; in particular, it intercepts and interprets system calls
with the <tt>PTRACE_SYSCALL</tt> operation.  What is really needed for a
fast <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> is the ability to <i>not</i> intercept that
particular call.  So Jeff's patch also extends <tt>ptrace()</tt> by adding
a <tt>PTRACE_SYSCALL_MASK</tt> operation.  This new operation can set a
bitmask indicating which system calls should be intercepted, and which
should be executed without stopping.
<p>

The result, with a suitably patched UML, is a <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> call
which runs at about 99% of the native process speed.  That may well be good
enough to make this patch a piece of the growing set of interfaces
supporting virtualization and containers.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One novel approach to speeding up gettimeofday that I heard about a few<br>
years ago (from Andrew Tridgell who implemented it on a different OS<br>
and architecture) was to get ride of the gettimeofday() system call<br>
entirely.  <br>
<p>
One model for doing this would be to use a read-only globally shared page which contained the current time (and things like the uname() struct pathconf() and sysconf() and whatever else will fit in one or two pages).<br>
<p>
These pages are mapped into every process' address space (similar to how VDSO's are mapping a kernel hosted userspace threading library implementation  --- but read-only rather than executable).  Then the gettimeofday() and uname() and a few other system calls can be implemented in user space by he libraries without including any context switch overhead.<br>
<p>
(Realistically you'd leave the system calls in for compatability but offer<br>
a faster more lightweight method as described; perhaps adding printk() options to help identify those apps which were using the slower, heavyweight system call method).<br>
<p>
One thing that's easy to misunderstand about UNIX is that the distinction between system call and library function can (from some perspective) be a bit arbitrary.  Classically a system call is any function which interfaces to kernel space while library functions can be wrapped around system calls  but are generally done entirely within a process' own address space (in user space).  However, with some of the memory mapping tricks (and memory mapped I/O hardware features) it's possible for many operations that would conception involve system calls to be implemented as library functions with suitable memory mappings.<br>
<p>
This is not to say that such memory mappings are "better" than system calls in the general case.  However, for some things like gettimeofday() and uname() there is a pretty clear win on (almost?) any modern virtual memory architecture.<br>

      That's indeed implement since some time (guess in the 2.5 era) in arch/x86_64/kernel/vsyscall.c, together with the time syscall and two empty slots.<br>

      There's actually a good reason for "messing deeply with their idea of time": testing applications that use timeouts and schedulers.  For example, suppose you want to see what happens after a month's worth of nightly batch processes have happened.  It's useful to be able to speed up time so it doesn't actually take a month to run the test.<br>
<p>
There are many ways to do this, but running software in fast-forward would be a useful tool in the application developer's toolkit.<br>

      From the other side of the equation, I would like to use this for avoiding timeouts. Quite a few applications time out after some time. I've even had free software applications tell me "You're running a version of XXXX, please upgrade." I've also had restricted materials time-out (in one case, a class distributed an educational application that stopped working when the semester ended). Bypassing these seems like a good and noble endeavor. <br>

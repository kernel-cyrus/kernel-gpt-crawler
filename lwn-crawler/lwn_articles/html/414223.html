The number of kernel regressions over time is one measure of the overall
quality of the kernel.  Over the last few years, Rafael
Wysocki has taken on the task of tracking those regressions and regularly
reporting on them to the linux-kernel mailing list.  In addition, he has
presented a "regressions report" at the last few Kernel Summits [<a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/412746/">2010</a>, <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/357480/">2009</a>, and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/298596/#regressions">2008</a>].  As part of
his preparation for this year's talk, Wysocki wrote a paper, <a
href="/images/pdf/kernel_regressions.pdf"><i>Tracking of Linux Kernel
Regressions</i> [PDF]</a>, that digs
in deeply and explains the process of Linux regression tracking, along with
various 
trends in regressions over time.  This article is an attempt to summarize
that work.
</p>

<p>
A regression is a user-visible change in the behavior of the kernel between
two releases.  A program that was working on one kernel version and then
suddenly stops working on a newer version has detected a kernel
regression.  Regressions are probably the most annoying kind of bug that
crops up in the
kernel development process, as well as the one of the most visible.  In
addition, Linus Torvalds has decreed that regressions may not be
intentionally introduced&mdash;to fix a perceived kernel shortcoming for
example&mdash;and that fixing inadvertent regressions should be a high
priority for the kernel developers.
</p>

<p>
There is another good reason to concentrate on fixing any regressions: if you
don't, you really have no assurance that the overall quality of the code is
increasing, or at least staying the same.  If things that are currently
working continue to work in the future, there is a level of comfort that
the bug situation is, at least, not getting worse.

<h4>Regression tracking process</h4>

<p>
To that end, various efforts have been made to track kernel regressions,
starting with Adrian Bunk in 2007 (around 2.6.20), through Micha&#322;
Piotrowski, and then to Wysocki during the 2.6.23 development cycle.  For
several years, Wysocki handled the regression tracking himself, but it is
now a three-person operation, with Maciej Rutecki turning email regression reports
into kernel bugzilla entries, and Florian Mickler maintaining the
regression entries: marking those that have been fixed, working with the
reporters to determine which have been fixed, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
The kernel bugzilla is used to track the regression meta-information as
well as the individual bugs.  Each kernel release has a bugzilla entry that
tracks all of the individual regressions that apply to it.  So, <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16444">bug #16444</a>
tracks the regressions reported against the 2.6.35 kernel release.  Each
individual regression is listed in the "Depends on" field in the meta-bug,
so that a quick look will show all of the bugs, and which have been
closed. 
</p>

<p>
There is another meta-bug, <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15790">bug #15790</a>,
that tracks all of the release-specific meta-bugs.  So, that bug depends on
#16444 for 2.6.35, as well as <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21782">#21782</a> for 2.6.36, <a
href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15310">#15310</a> for
2.6.33, and so on.  Those bugs are used by the scripts that Wysocki runs to
generate the "list of known regressions" which gets posted to linux-kernel
after each -rc release.
</p>

<p>
Regressions are added to bugzilla one week after they are reported by
email, if they 
haven't been fixed the interim. That's a change from earlier practices to
save Rutecki's time as well as to reduce unhelpful noise.  Bugzilla entries
are linked to fixes as they become available. The bug state is
changed to "resolved" once a patch is available and "closed" once Torvalds
merges the fix into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Regressions for a particular kernel release are tracked through the
following two development cycles.  For example, when 2.6.36 was released,
the tracking of 2.6.34 regressions ended.  When 2.6.37-rc1 was released,
that began the tracking for 2.6.36, and once 2.6.37 is released in early
2011, tracking of 2.6.35 regressions will cease.  That doesn't mean that
any remaining regressions have magically been fixed, of course, and they
can still be tracked using the meta-bug associated with a release.
</p>

<h4>Regression statistics</h4>

<p>
To look at the historical regression data, Wysocki compiled a table that
listed the number of regressions reported for each of the last ten kernel
releases as well as the number that are still pending (i.e. have not been
closed).   For the table, he has removed invalid and
duplicate reports from those listed in bugzilla.  It should also be noted
that after 2.6.32, the methodology for adding new regressions changed such
that those that were fixed in the first week after being reported were not
added to bugzilla.  That at least partially explains the drop in reports
after 2.6.32.

<tr><th colspan=3>Reported and pending regressions</th></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The number of "pending" regressions reflects the bugs that have been fixed
since the release, not just those that were fixed during the
two-development-cycle 
tracking period.  In order to look more closely at what
happens during the tracking period, Wysocki provides another table.  That
table separates the
two most important events during the tracking period, which are the releases of
the subsequent kernel versions (i.e. for 2.6.N, the releases of N+1 and N+2).  

<p>
For example, once the 2.6.35 kernel was
released, that ended the period where the development focus was on fixing
regressions in 2.6.34.  At that point, the merge window for 2.6.36 opened
and developers switched their focus to adding new features for the next
release.  Furthermore, once 2.6.36
was released, regressions were no longer tracked at all for 2.6.34.  That is
reflected in the following table where the first "reports" and "pending"
columns correspond to the N+1 kernel release, and the second to the N+2 release.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=3>
<tr><th>Kernel</th><th> # reports (N+1)</th><th> # pending (N+1)</th><th> # reports (N+2)</th><th> # pending (N+2)</th></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2.6.30</td><td align="right"> 122</td><td align="right"> 36</td><td align="right"> 170</td><td align="right"> 45</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td align="right">2.6.31</td><td align="right"> 89</td><td align="right"> 31</td><td align="right"> 145</td><td align="right"> 42</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2.6.32</td><td align="right"> 101</td><td align="right"> 36</td><td align="right"> 131</td><td align="right"> 45</td></tr>
<tr class="Even"><td align="right">2.6.33</td><td align="right"> 74</td><td align="right"> 33</td><td align="right"> 114</td><td align="right"> 27</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2.6.34</td><td align="right"> 87</td><td align="right"> 31</td><td align="right"> 119</td><td align="right"> 21</td></tr>

<tr><th colspan=5 align="center">Reported and pending regressions (separated by release)</th></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The table shows that the number of regressions still goes up fairly
substantially after the release the next (N+1) kernel.  This indicates that
the -rc kernels may not be getting as much testing as the released kernel
does.  In addition, the pending kernel numbers are substantially higher for
the N+2 kernel release, at least in the 2.6.30-32 timeframe.  Had that
trend continued, it could be argued that the kernel developers were paying
less attention to regressions in a particular release once the next
release was out.  But the 2.6.33-34 numbers are fairly
substantially down after the N+2 release, and Wysocki says that there are
indications that 2.6.35 
is continuing that trend.

<h4>Reporting and fixing regressions</h4>

<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2010/regression-closed.png" width=640 height=480
alt="[Open regressions graph]">
</center>

<p>
We can look at the number of outstanding regressions over time in one of
the graphs from Wysocki's paper.  For each kernel release, there are
generally two peaks that indicate where the number of open regressions is
highest.  These roughly correspond with the end of the merge window and the
release date for the next kernel version.  Once past those maximums, the
graphs tend to level out.

<p>
There are abrupt jumps in the number of regressions that are probably an
artifact of how the reporting is done.  Email reports are generally batched
up, with multiple reports being added at roughly the same time.
Maintenance on the bugs can happen in much the same way, which results in
multiple regressions closed in a short period of time.  That leads to a
much more jagged graph, with sharper peaks.

<p>
In the paper, Wysocki did some curve fitting for the the 2.6.33-34 releases
that corresponded reasonably well with the observed data.  He noted that
the incomplete 2.6.35 curve was anomalous in that it didn't have a sharp
maximum and seemed to plateau, rather than drop off.  He attributes that to
the shortened merge window for 2.6.37 along with the Kernel Summit and Linux
Plumbers Conference impacting the testing and debugging of the current
development kernels.  Nevertheless, he used the same curve fitting
equations on the 2.6.35 data to derive a "prediction" that it would end up
with slightly more regressions than .33 and .34, but still less than 30.
It will be interesting to see if that is borne out in practice.

<h4>Regression lifetime</h4>

<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2010/regression-lifetime.png" width=640 height=480
alt="[Lifetime graph]">
</center>

<p>
The lifetime of regressions is another area that Wysocki addresses.  One of
his graphs is reproduced above and shows the cumulative number of
regressions whose lifetime is less than the number of days on the x-axis.
He separates the regressions into two sets, those from kernel 2.6.26-30 and
from 2.6.30-35.  In both cases, the curves follow that of radioactive
decay, which allows for the derivation of the half-life for a set of kernel
regressions: roughly 17 days.

<p>
The graph for 2.6.30-35 is obviously lower than that of the earlier
kernels, which Wysocki attributes to the change in methodology that occurred
in the 2.6.32 timeframe.  Because there are fewer short-lived (i.e. less
than a week) regressions tracked, that will lead to a higher average
regression lifetime.  The average for the earlier kernels is 24.4 days,
while the later kernels have an average of 32.3 days.  Wysocki posits
that the average really hasn't changed and that 24.5 days is a reasonable
number to use as
an average lifetime for regressions over the past two years or so.

<h4>Regressions by subsystem</h4>

<p>
Certain kernel subsystems have been more prone to regressions than others
over the last few releases, as is shown in a pair of tables from Wysocki's
paper. He cautions that 
it is somewhat difficult to accurately place regressions into a particular
category, as they may be incorrectly assigned in bugzilla.  There are also
murky boundaries between some of the categories, with power management (PM)
being used as an example.  Bugs that clearly fall into the PM core, or
those that are PM-related but the root cause is unknown, get assigned to
the PM category, while bugs in a driver's suspend/resume code get assigned
to the category of the driver.  Wysocki notes that these numbers should be
used as a rough guide to where regressions are being found, rather than as
an absolute and completely accurate measure.

<p>
The Intel DRI driver and x86 categories are by far the largest source of
regressions, but there are a number of possible reasons for that.  The
Intel PC ecosystem is both complex, with many different variations of
hardware, and well-tested because there are so many of those systems in
use.  Other architectures may not be getting the same level of testing,
especially during the -rc phase. 
</p>

<p> It is also clear from the table that those subsystems
that are "closer" to the hardware tend to have more regressions.  The eight
rows with 20 or more total regressions&mdash;excepting filesystems and
networking to some extent&mdash;are all closely tied to hardware.  Those
kinds of regressions tend to be easier to spot because they cause the
hardware to fail, unlike regressions in the scheduler or memory management
code, for example, which are often more subtle.

<p>
It is also instructive to look at the remaining pending regressions by
category.  In the table above, we can see that most of the regressions
identified have been fixed, with only relatively few persisting.  Those are
likely to be bugs that are difficult to reproduce, and thus track down.
Some categories, like ACPI, fall completely out of the table, which
indicates that those developers have been very good at finding and fixing
regressions in that subsystem.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
Regression tracking is important so that kernel developers are able to
focus their bug fixing efforts during each development cycle.  But looking
at the bigger picture&mdash;how the number and types of regressions change&mdash;is also needed.  Given the nature of kernel development, it
is impossible to draw any conclusions from the data collected for any single
release. By aggregating data over multiple development cycles, any oddities
specific to a particular cycle are smoothed out, which allows for trends to
be spotted.
</p>

<p>
Since regressions are a key indicator of kernel quality, and easier to
track than many others, they serve a key role in keeping Torvalds and
other kernel developers aware of kernel quality issues.  As the developers
get more familiar with the "normal" regression patterns, it will become
more obvious that a given release is falling outside of those patterns,
which may mean that it needs more attention&mdash;or that something has
changed in the development process.  In any case, there is clearly value in
the statistics, and that value is likely to grow over time.

It's too late now, but if you had a reliable reproducer script and had git-bisected the patch before a kernel was released with the bug then the patch would absolutely have been reverted.<br>
<p>
Anyway I can assure you that there is zero percent chance that anyone has looked at your bug in the last four months.<br>
<p>
People don't look at bugzilla entries if someone has already responded to it.  This cuts down on duplication of effort which is good but if the first guy doesn't solve your problem then you're screwed so that's bad.<br>
<p>
Another part of why other people don't get involved is that it's just too difficult to get any information out of bugzilla once people start adding comments.  In this bug, we have to read through 18 comments to find that the last working kernel was 2.6.30.10.  Most of the comments are just noise.<br>
<p>
Q: "Can you run this test?"<br>
A: "Ran it.  No difference."<br>
Q: "What about this test?"<br>
A: "Same thing"<br>
Q: "Ok.  I have to make a phone call will work on this tomorrow"<br>
A: "Ok"<br>
Q: "Can you test this on jffs2?"<br>
A: "Tested for 30 minutes.  Works!"<br>
Q: "Excellent.  Please try this patch."<br>
A: "Actually I spoke too soon earlier.  It failed after an hour."<br>
<p>
And on and on and on...<br>
  <br>
If would help if bugzilla had a "Problem Summary" and a "Solution Summary" thing that could be updated.  I'm certainly not going to read through 60 comments to try figure out what's going on.<br>
<p>
The thing to do is to write up a summary and send it to the list.  Also paste it in your bugzilla entry.<br>
<p>
Even though it's too late to just revert the patch which caused the bug it would still be useful to do a git bisect.  That way you know who is responsible to fix your bug and you can CC them when you send your message to the email list.<br>

I concur.  According to the developers, Bugzilla does have these features.  You just have to add them yourself.<br>

This is a really important review that I'd like to see redone with every new kernel.<br>
<p>
It seems that some of these regressions are become permanent features.  If a regression from 2.6.23 were fixed, would that in itself be a regression?<br>

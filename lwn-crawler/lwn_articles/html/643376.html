<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 6, 2015</br>
           </div>
The handling and parsing of string data has long been acknowledged as a
fertile breeding ground for bugs and security issues; that is doubly true
when the C language — whose string model leaves a bit to be desired — is in
use.  Various attempts have been made to improve C string handling, both
in the kernel and in user space, but few think that the problem has been
solved.  A couple of current projects may improve the situation on
the kernel side, though.
<p>
<h4>String copying</h4>
<p>
The venerable <tt>strcpy()</tt> family of functions has long been seen as
error-prone and best avoided.  In most settings, they are replaced with
functions like <tt>strncpy()</tt> or <tt>strlcpy()</tt>.  The <a
href="/Articles/612244/">last time</a> your editor wrote about criticisms
of <tt>strlcpy()</tt>, he was treated to a long series of incendiary emails
from one of its supporters.  So, for the purposes of this article, suffice
to say that not all developers are fond of those functions.  Even so, the
kernel contains implementations of both, and there are over 1,000 call
sites for each.
<p>
That doesn't mean that there isn't room for improvement, though.  Chris
Metcalf thinks he has an improvement in the form of the proposed <a
href="/Articles/643140/"><tt>strscpy()</tt></a> API, which provides two new
functions:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t strscpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t count);
    ssize_t strscpy_truncate(char *dest, const char *src, size_t count);
</pre>
<p>
As with similar functions, <tt>strscpy()</tt> will copy a maximum of
<tt>count</tt> bytes from <tt>src</tt> to <tt>dest</tt>, but it differs in
the details.  The return value in this case is the number of bytes copied,
unless the source string is longer than <tt>count</tt> bytes; in that case,
the return value will be <tt>-E2BIG</tt> instead.  Another difference is
that, in the overflow case, <tt>dest</tt> will be set to the empty string
rather than a truncated version of <tt>src</tt>.
<p>
This behavior is designed to make overflows as obvious as possible and to
prevent code from blithely proceeding with a truncated string.  When
questioned on this behavior, Chris <a
href="/Articles/643382/">justified</a> it this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	1. A truncated string with an error return may still cause program
	errors, even if the caller checks for the error return, if the
	buffer is later interpreted as a valid string due to some other
	program error.  It's defensive programming.
<p>
	2. Programmers are fond of ignoring error returns.  My experience
	with truncated strings is that in too many cases, truncation causes
	program errors down the line.  It's better to ensure that no
	partial string is returned in this case.
<p>
	In a perfect world, all error returns would be checked, and there
	would be no need for this, but we definitely don't live in that
	world :-)
</div>
<p>
For cases where the code can handle a truncated string,
<tt>strscpy_truncate()</tt> can be used.  Its return value convention is
the same, but it will fit as much of the string as possible
(null-terminated) in <tt>dest</tt>.
<p>
<h4>Integer parsing</h4>
<p>
The kernel must often turn strings into integer values; the interpretation of
numbers written to sysfs files or found on the kernel command line are a
couple of obvious examples.  This parsing can be done with functions like
<tt>simple_strtoul()</tt> (which decodes a string to an <tt>unsigned
long</tt>), but they were <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/67d0a0754455f89ef3946946159d8ec9e45ce33a">marked
as being obsolete</a> in 2011.  The checkpatch script complains about
their use, but there are still about 1,000 call sites in the kernel.
Current advice is to use <tt>kstrtoul()</tt> and the better part of a dozen
variants, also <a href="/Articles/435022/">added in 2011</a>.  There are
almost 2,000 uses of these functions in the kernel, but Alexey Dobriyan <a
href="/Articles/643159/">thinks we can do better</a>.
<p>
Alexey has a few complaints about the current APIs.  One of the reasons for
moving beyond the <tt>simple_strto*()</tt> functions was that they would
silently stop conversion at a non-digit character — "<tt>123abc</tt>" would
be successfully converted to 123.  That is the sort of behavior for which
PHP is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9484757">roundly
criticized</a>, but, Alexey says, there are times when it is useful.  He
gives the parsing of device numbers (usually given in the "<tt>major:minor</tt>"
format) as an example.  The <tt>kstrto*()</tt> family cannot easily be used
for that kind of parsing, but there are plenty of reasons to not go back to
<tt>simple_strto*()</tt> for that kind of work.
<p>
His suggestion is the addition of a new function:
<p>
<pre>
    int parse_integer(const char *s, unsigned int base, &lt;type&gt; *val);
</pre>
<p>
In truth, <tt>parse_integer()</tt> is not a function; it is instead a
rather unsightly macro that arranges to do the right thing for a wide
variety of types for <tt>val</tt>.  So, if <tt>val</tt> is an <tt>unsigned
short</tt>, the decoding will be done on an unsigned basis and will be
checked to ensure that the resulting value does not exceed the range of a
<tt>short</tt>.
<p>
A successful decoding will cause the result to be placed in <tt>val</tt>;
the number of characters decoded will come back as the return value.  If it
is expected that the entire string will be decoded, a quick check to see
whether <tt>s[return_value]</tt> is a null byte can verify that.
Otherwise, parsing of the string can continue from the indicated point.  If
the <tt>base</tt> is ORed with the undocumented value
<tt>PARSE_INTEGER_NEWLINE</tt>, a final newline character will be skipped
over — useful for parsing input to sysfs files.  If
no characters at all are converted, the return value will be
<tt>-EINVAL</tt>; an overflow will return <tt>-ERANGE</tt> instead.  
<p>
Alexey's patch set turns the <tt>kstrto*()</tt> functions into calls to
<tt>parse_integer()</tt>; it also converts a number of
<tt>simple_strto*()</tt> calls to direct <tt>parse_integer()</tt> calls.
The end result is an apparent simplification of the code and net reduction
in lines of code.
<p>
Whether either of these patch sets will find its way into the kernel is not
entirely clear; kernel developers do not, in general, tend to get too
excited about string-parsing functions.  In both cases, though, the
potential exists for improvements to the massive amounts of parsing code
found in the kernel while simultaneously making it simpler.  In the end,
most developers will find it hard to argue against something like that.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think it would be better for strscpy to require that count should be at least 1 treating count==0 as a programming error with similar consequences as passing a null pointer. This way one can be assured that the result is always null-terminated no matter what.<br>

      I'd also suggest that -E2BIG is a really bad return value.  Rather return -(space_needed).

<pre>
int rc = strscpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));
if (rc &lt; 0) {
   dest = malloc(-rc);
   strscpy(dest, src, -rc);
}
</pre>
...or something like that anyway.

For the kernel, -E2BIG is often what you want.<br>
<p>
long sys_foo(...)<br>
{<br>
  long ret = 0;<br>
<p>
  /* ... */<br>
<p>
  ret = strscpy(dest, src, sizeof_dest);<br>
  if (ret &lt; 0)<br>
    goto err;<br>
  /* ret now has the string length, saving a strlen() */<br>
<p>
  /* ... */<br>
<p>
  return ret;<br>
<p>
err:<br>
  /* ...cleanup... */<br>
  return ret;<br>
}<br>
<p>
That is, in case of error, the value can be returned directly to userspace. That is a common design pattern in the kernel: if a function you called returns a negative value (indicating failure), abort what you were doing and pass that value up the stack.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 3, 2016</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, Linus has pulled 10,589 non-merge changesets into the
mainline repository; that is 7,433 since <a href="/Articles/695294/">last
week's summary</a>.  Clearly it has been a busy week.  As is often the
case, much of the work being merged takes the form of internal improvements
that are not immediately visible to kernel users, but a number of
interesting features have found their way in as well.
<p>
Some of the more significant user-visible features include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The arm64 architecture has gained support for the kexec mechanism
     (allowing one kernel to boot directly into another) and kernel
     probes. 
<p>
<li> The TCP "New Vegas" congestion-control algorithm is now supported.
     New Vegas is a significant update to Vegas, adding better support for
     data-center settings in particular.  See <a
     href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-53jbO_xH-m9g2YCgjaf5bK8vePjWP6Mk0rYiRLK-U/edit">this
     document</a> for details.
<p>
<li> The mac80211 ("WiFi") layer has seen some interesting
     congestion-control changes.  Normal queuing disciplines interact
     poorly with the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_aggregation">frame
     aggregation</a> mechanism used by wireless protocols, leading to poor
     performance, so the queuing discipline code has been disabled for
     mac80211.  Instead, the mac80211 layer 
     is now using the <a href="/Articles/496509/">CoDel</a> fair-queuing
     algorithm.  This should be a significant step forward for better WiFi
     performance on Linux.
<p>
<li> The <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Datagram_Sockets">reliable
     datagram sockets</a> (RDS) protocol allows the creation of
     datagram-oriented connections over a TCP link.  In 4.8, the RDS
     implementation can use multiple TCP connections to support RDS routing
     between two hosts, greatly increasing the maximum throughput.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/161cd45ff0670c3068adb3de33e26495b648e906">this
     changelog</a> for some details and a discussion of how this protocol
     differs from <a href="/Articles/544399/">multipath TCP</a>.
<p>
<li> The "express data path" (XDP) work described in <a
     href="/Articles/682538/">this article</a> has moved forward.  In 4.8,
     network drivers can define a hook allowing a BPF program to be loaded;
     that program will run on incoming packets before they even have
     internal data structures set up for them.  The hook can indicate that
     packets should be dropped, but it also has the ability to do simple
     rewriting and forwarding.  For some types of workloads, the result can
     be greatly increased performance without the need for kernel bypass
     techniques.
<p>
<li> The kernel's pseudo-random number generator <a
     href="/Articles/686033/">has been replaced</a> with a new
     implementation using the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant">ChaCha20
     stream cipher</a>.  There have also been some changes made to address
     scalability problems when user-space programs are consuming massive
     amounts of random data.
<p>
<li> The memory-management subsystem's page-reclaim mechanism has been
     fundamentally reworked to track pages based on NUMA nodes rather than
     on memory zones.  As Mel Gorman noted in <a
     href="/Articles/694121/">the patch posting</a>, zone-based reclaim was
     important in the days of 32-bit systems with a lot of high memory
     but, now that large-memory systems are mostly running 64-bit kernels,
     node-based reclaim is a more suitable approach.  Users should see
     little change beyond, hopefully, better performance; see the posting
     for a number of benchmark results.
<p>
<li> A fair amount of work has been put in toward the goal of allowing
     unprivileged users to mount filesystems in user namespaces.  That goal
     still depends on a number of remaining loose ends being addressed,
     though, and so will not be achieved in the 4.8 development cycle.
<p>
<li> The kernel has gained support for the <a
     href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5570">Common Architecture Label
     IPv6 Security Option</a> (CALIPSO) standard.  CALIPSO can be used to
     attach security labels to packets, making them subject to normal
     (SELinux or Smack) security policies.
<P>
<li> The PowerPC64 architecture now has a just-in-time compiler for BPF
     programs. 
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/691102/">GCC plugin infrastructure</a> patches
     have been merged, making it possible to use plugin modules to the
     compiler to modify how the kernel is built.  As of this writing,
     plugins for coverage testing and calculation of cyclomatic complexity
     have been merged.  The "latent entropy" plugin, which tries to
     generate entropy early in the bootstrap process, is in a pull request
     but has not been pulled as of this writing.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>skb_array</tt> mechanism adds an array-based FIFO data
     structure for the queuing of network packets; see <a
     href="/Articles/696079/"><tt>&lt;linux/skb_array.h&gt;</tt></a> for an
     overview of the API. 
<p>
<li> The task of <a href="/Articles/537562/">reworking the CPU hotplug
     mechanism</a> continues with the conversion of more notifiers to the
     new scheme.  As Thomas Gleixner put it in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a6408f6cb63ac0958fee7dbce7861ffb540d8a49">the
     pull request</a>: "<q>Another 700 hundred line of unpenetrable maze
     gone</q>". 

</ul>
<p>
The 4.8 merge window still has a few days to run, so expect a few more
features to land before the 4.8-rc1 release comes out.  Next week's Kernel
Page will, of course, contain an update with the final changes to be merged
for this development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>It's a concern because the kernel and networking hardware are using different-but-similar technologies to do the same thing: the kernel using BPF extensions and networking hardware using <a href="http://p4.org/">P4</a>. At some point it will be desirable to run P4 within the kernel -- so the same systems can provision on-hardware networking and on-host networking. Hopefully later integration of P4 into the kernel will be possible, rather than being rejected for feature duplication.</p>

P4 is a much more high-level language than BPF though. P4 tends to be compiled to something else that is synthesisable to hardware or JITable. Indeed, don't the P4 tools come with something to transform it to BPF?<br>
<p>
It is unfortunate though that there's split between the hardware world and the software world on how fast packet filter+action processes should be specified. Sigh.<br>

      <p>It's not that exciting, unfortunately - it's just support for the Mali display controller, whose job is to take a framebuffer in memory and pump it through a connector to a display.

To be fair, its job is slightly more interesting than that - it can composite multiple layers with alpha blending, rotation, scaling, colour conversion, etc, on the fly as it's pumping lines out to the display.<br>
<p>
Still almost completely unrelated to the Mali GPU, though. And the Mali Video processors. And the country of Mali. Maybe not the most unambiguous of brand names...<br>

Have any further information or links on the subject?  I was recently bemoaning my inability to do precisely this a few days back and would be interested in the big picture of what the developers would like to do (overlayfs?  ext3 / loopback?  Read/write or read-only?  Security concerns?  Etc).<br>

Usually I see such things in the list of interesting development branches at the bottom of the Kernel page. There doesn't seem to be a link for this branch though.<br>

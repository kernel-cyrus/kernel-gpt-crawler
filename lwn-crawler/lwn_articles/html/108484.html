<div class="ArticleText">
There has been an increase in complaints about the 2.6 development model
recently.  Some observers are dismayed by the continued high rate of change
in 2.6, and have posted calls for the creation of a 2.7 branch and
restricting 2.6 to critical bug fixes only.  Failure to separate
development and maintenance in this way, it is said, hurts the reputation
of the Linux kernel and subjects users to needless regressions.
<p>

The interesting thing with this discussion is that the people objecting to
the current development mode have not been able to point to much in the way
of specific problems that have resulted from it.  A few specific bugs have
been listed, but most of those have been around for some time and cannot be
said to have resulted from recently-merged new features.  The only
complaint which holds water might be <a href="/Articles/108507/">this
one</a> regarding the plight of some out-of-tree kernel development project
(PaX in particular).  PaX, it seems, is stuck at 2.6.7 because its
developers have not yet been able to respond to subsequent changes in
internal interfaces.
<p>

This argument, of course, does not get very far with most kernel
developers.  There is an increasing amount of pressure to get out-of-tree
projects to submit their code and become part of the mainline tree.  Code
which is in the mainline gets fixed (usually) when internal interfaces
change, but only the original developers can maintain external code.  So
the standard answer to this sort of complaint is "merge your patches."
Changes in the development model to accommodate out-of-tree projects are
unlikely.
<p>

Not every 2.6 kernel release has been 100% stable, but the same can be said
of previous stable kernel series as well.  What <i>is</i> different this
time is that 2.6 has a great many new features and improvements which would
not have been merged under the older model.  Many of those improvements
would, instead, have been backported by distributors and shipped as part of
the "stable" kernel anyway.  Under the new scheme, those patches are merged
into the mainline, are debugged by everybody involved, and are available to
all users.  It seems unlikely that most users truly wish to go back to the
old days, when distributors shipped highly divergent kernels with
(literally) hundreds of patches.
<p>

There are occasional requests for bugfix-only "point" releases for the
major 2.6 kernels.  Rather than wait for 2.6.10, and take all of the other
changes which come with that kernel, some people wish for a 2.6.9.1 (and so
on) with just the important fixes.  The standard response to <i>that</i>
request is that anybody can create and maintain such a tree.  So far,
however, there has not been sufficient demand for this tree to motivate
somebody to actually do the work.  (It should be noted, though, that Alan
Cox has restarted posting his "-ac" patches, which contain fixes that are,
in his opinion, important).

<p>
All of the above distracts from the <i>real</i> development model
discussion: what Linus should call his intermediate releases.  There is a
steady stream of objections to the "-rc" scheme, since, in fact, very few
such kernels are actually release candidates.  Linus pondered the issue,
but decided to call the first 2.6.10 prepatch <a
href="/Articles/107822/">2.6.10-rc1</a> anyway:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	And the fact is, I can't see the point. I'll just call it all
	"-rcX", because I (very obviously) have no clue where the
	cut-over-point from "pre" to "rc" is, or (even more painfully
	obviously) where it will become the final next release.  So to not
	overtax my poor brain, I'll just call them all -rc releases, and
	hope that developers see them as a sign that there's been stuff
	merged, and we should start calming down and seeing to the merged
	patches being stable soon enough.
</div>
<p>

So the -rc names will continue for the foreseeable future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I can't see why they can't try short timebased releases then. I know the kernel is a much different project than other open source projects.<br>
<p>
"If a feature isn't ready/stable for the freeze back it out."<br>
This works when there is a short time untill the next stable release occurs. <br>
<p>
It works so well for GNOME and KDE.<br>

      <p>I can't complain about 2.6 giving me problems, but that's because I haven't tried 2.6 yet.  I'm waiting until it stabilizes in the sense that it has received significant "test and debug" attention from developers while simultaneously receiving zero "add features and re-organize" attention.

<p>Saying "We haven't heard users complaining about it breaking, even though we just added a whole bunch of new and rewritten code." does not persuade me that I should take the risk of upgrading from my reliable old 2.4 kernel.

      I've been running 2.6 on 2 machines for quite some time (one since 2.6.0, one since ~April), and haven't had any problems with its stability. In fact, the only kernel bug I've encountered was on another machine running 2.4.26, and I identified it as a kernel issue in part by finding that it didn't happen in 2.6.4 (evidentally, it was fixed before 2.6.0, unless the Changelog lines were not informative); I applied a patch from 2.4.27, which seemed to be a backport, to fix it. So it looks to me like 2.4 is essentially just stale at this point, and that 2.6 has more effective debugging.<br>
<p>
I do agree that the mainline unmarked releases have not been thoroughly tested upon release. It would be nice if Linus would delegate assigning version numbers to releases to someone else. But using an unmarked release after it has been around for a little while is quite reliable.<br>

<P>
Feel yourself lucky. umount crashes my 2.6.9 kernel about 50% of the time at shutdown. OK, the machine is supposed to be turned off after that anyway, so it's not a big problem but it could be really annoying with an ext2 filesystem fsck'ing at next boot (fortunately I use ext3). I really should google about this problem...

      Thanks for the Linux Counter kernel link.  It's interesting that over 20% of the systems counted are running Debian 2.4.18-bf2.4!  Time for an upgrade...

      One of the reason behind this new model was to have distributions use a more or less stock kernel. Anyone has information on whether distributions now patch less their kernels than before?<br>

and for 2.6

<pre>
[alex@cambridge SOURCES]$ bunzip2 -c linux-2.6.3-q7.tar.bz2 | tar -tv | grep "patches" | wc -l
274
</pre>

However not entirely unexpected as there are a lot of backported features in the 2.4 kernel that where 2.6 features. I suspect as more of the desktop "features" make it into the mainline the more patches will drop out.

      However the Mandrake Cooker kernel has jumped ahead

<pre>
[alex@cambridge SOURCES]$ bunzip2 -c linux-2.6.8.1-q10.tar.bz2 | tar -tv | grep "patches" | wc -l

So the answer would seem to be no, not yet.

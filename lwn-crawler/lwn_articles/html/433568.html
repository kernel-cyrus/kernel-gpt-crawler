<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 16, 2011</br>
           </div>
Last week's Kernel Page included <a href="/Articles/432114/">an article
about improving the <tt>ptrace()</tt> interface</a>; the author of that
work, Tejun Heo, was quoted as saying that part of the problem with
<tt>ptrace()</tt> is that it has been starved of developer attention in
favor of efforts to replace it entirely.  One of those efforts is uprobes,
which has also been featured on this page a few times.  <a
href="/Articles/433327/">A new uprobes patch</a> was posted on
March&nbsp;14; so this seems like a good time to have a look at it and
further deprive <tt>ptrace()</tt> of attention.  Uprobes looks like it is
getting closer to acceptance, but it seems unlikely that the 11th revision
will be the last.
<p>
The purpose of the uprobes subsystem is what one might expect: to enable
the placement of probes into user-space executable process memory.  These
probes might be used to support a debugger like gdb (though uprobes is <a
href="/Articles/433572/">said</a> to be unsuitable for use by gdb in its
current form) or to support user-space tracing.  This feature does thus
duplicate some of the functionality provided by <tt>ptrace()</tt>, which
will make its acceptance harder, especially since <tt>ptrace()</tt> is
(more or less) a standardized interface.  To succeed, uprobes will clearly
have to do things better than <tt>ptrace()</tt> does.
<p>
The <tt>ptrace()</tt> interface is tied to processes; uprobes, instead,
works with files.  A probe is placed at a certain offset within a specific
file; it will then trigger for every process which executes through the
probe's location.  If the code placing the probe is only interested in
specific processes, it will need to filter the events itself.  The
interface may seem a little strange - users will probably almost always be
interested in specific processes - but there are some advantages to doing
things this way.
<p>
Underneath the hood, uprobes works by faulting in the page which will
contain the probe.  The instruction at the probe location is copied aside
and replaced by a breakpoint.  Every process which has that file mapped then
gets a pointer in its <tt>mm</tt> structure pointing to the data describing
the probe(s) for that file.  When a process executes the breakpoint, the
probe's handler 
function will be called; on that handler's return, the kernel will
single-step the displaced instruction, then return to the location following
the probe.

</blockquote>
<p>
This "execute out of line" (XOL) mechanism has been controversial in the
past because it requires the injection of a new virtual memory area (VMA)
into every process which encounters probes.  That VMA is seen as a
distortion of the process's behavior which could have strange effects.  The
alternatives, though, are not entirely appealing either.  The
<tt>ptrace()</tt> approach is to put the original instruction back into its
original location, execute it, then replace the breakpoint; that only works
if every process which has the file mapped is stopped for the duration of
the operation (otherwise they might execute the affected code while the
breakpoint is missing).  Uprobes, instead, is able to handle breakpoint hits without
perturbing other processes.  Another alternative discussed in the past is
emulating the displaced instruction in the kernel; that requires having a
full x86 emulator in kernel space, which is not entirely appealing either.
So the current plan appears to be to stick with XOL.
<p>
Not having to stop the world when a breakpoint is hit is one of the
advantages of uprobes, but there are others.  It dispenses with the whole
<tt>ptrace()</tt> mechanism involving signals, reparenting processes, and
so on.  Handling a probe hit does not require a context switch unless the
probe itself does; many types of tracing tasks, for example, would never
have to switch 
to another process.  Uprobes also allows multiple applications to be
tracing the same set of processes at the same time.  All of these make the
interface appealing to some users.
<p>
Who those users are is not clear to everybody, though.  There is clearly
some interest in the SystemTap camp, but the needs of SystemTap do not
necessarily carry a lot of weight on linux-kernel.  Thomas Gleixner <a
href="/Articles/433582/">put it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And it does not matter at all whether systemtap can use this or
	not. If the main debuggers used like gdb are not going to use it
	then it's a complete waste. We don't need another debugging
	interface just for a single esoteric use case.
</div>
<p>
At times, gdb developers have <a href="/Articles/433895/">indicated</a>
that they might be open to using 
a Linux-specific interface if there were advantages to doing so.  Such use
seems distant at the moment, though.  More immediate users are likely to be
found in the tracing community; uprobes opens the possibility of getting
single stream of trace data covering both user and kernel space.
<tt>ptrace()</tt> is not a useful interface for tracing, so something needs
to be done (though there is still some disagreement over whether user-space
tracing needs to involve the kernel at all).  Uprobes might be that
something.
<p>
In fact, this version of the uprobes patch includes an ftrace-based
interface.  Part&nbsp;20 of the patch contains the entirety of the
documentation for this feature, quoted below:
<p>
<pre>
    # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
    # cat /proc/`pgrep  zsh`/maps | grep /bin/zsh | grep r-xp
    00400000-0048a000 r-xp 00000000 08:03 130904 /bin/zsh
    # objdump -T /bin/zsh | grep -w zfree
    0000000000446420 g    DF .text  0000000000000012  Base        zfree
    # echo 'p /bin/zsh:0x46420 %ip %ax' &gt; uprobe_events
    # cat uprobe_events
    p:uprobes/p_zsh_0x46420 /bin/zsh:0x0000000000046420
    # echo 1 &gt; events/uprobes/enable
    # sleep 20
    # echo 0 &gt; events/uprobes/enable
    # cat trace
</pre>
<p>
An actual document is listed as a "TODO" item.  The current interface looks
a bit painful to use, and it appears to be limited to printing register
contents for now.  A more flexible and better documented interface could
prove useful, though, especially if (as planned) it also can be made to
work with the perf events subsystem.
<p>
The comments on the patch set indicate some concern about whether the
kernel needs the feature or not.  But even the more critical reviewers
have been going over the code pointing out small things - the kind of
review one does when one wants to help the author get the code into shape
for merging.  This code will not be merged for 2.6.39, and, for this type
of code, making predictions for merging at any definite time is a hazardous
affair.  But, given sufficient will, it seems like uprobes could be made
ready for inclusion sometime this year.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

So, if I want to put a probe in libc.so, it ends up being executed by every process on the system?<br>
<p>
Presumably I would have to have write permissions to libc to do so - so if gdb was to use this, I wouldn't be able to set breakpoints on library functions unless I'm root? That sounds like a nonstarter to me.<br>

A future gdb interface for this functionality would not require nor give you any new privileges.  Probes would be naturally restricted to your processes.  No actual writing to the disk files is done.<br>
<p>
Systemtap has the same properties w.r.t. the older utrace/uprobes it carries: a root user can operate systemwide, and an unprivileged user can operate upon her own processes.<br>

The merge window for the 6.11 kernel release opened on July&nbsp;14; as of
this writing, 4,072 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline
repository since then.  This merge window, in other words, is just now
beginning.  Still, there has been enough time for a number of interesting
changes to land for the next kernel release; read on for a summary of what
has been merged so far.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
Some of the most significant changes in the first half of the 6.11 merge
window include:
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The 64-bit Arm architecture now support CPU hotplug on ACPI systems;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/828ce929d1c3">this
     documentation commit</a> for more information.
<li> X86 kernels can now run as a guest under AMD's <a
     href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html">SEV-SNP</a> secure
     encrypted virtualization machinery using a <a
     href="/Articles/921266/">secure VM service module</a>.
<li> The x86 "fake EFI memory map" feature, which allows the creation of
     fictional memory-map entries at boot, has been removed.  The feature
     is thought to be unused and is not consistent with
     confidential-computing configurations; as <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e55037c879a0">the merge message</a>
     puts it: "<q>With recent developments regarding confidential VMs and
     unaccepted memory, combined with kexec, creating a known inaccurate
     view of the firmware's memory map and handing it to the OS is a
     feature we can live without, hence the removal.</q>
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The io_uring subsystem now provides operations implementing <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html"><tt>bind()</tt></a>
     and <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html"><tt>listen()</tt></a>. 
<li> A new set of <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations on the nsfs (namespace)
     filesystem will perform translations of process and thread-group IDs
     between PID namespaces.
<li> The pidfd filesystem also supports some new <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls
     to obtain namespace file descriptors for a process represented by a
     pidfd.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/978189/">nested bottom-half locking patches</a>
     have been merged; this is primarily a latency improvement for realtime
     kernels, but should bring benefits to other users as well.
<li> BPF enhancements include <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4665415975b0">a new iterator</a>
     for working through bitmasks, a <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3f8fde319524">notification
     mechanism</a> to tell user space when a <tt>struct_ops</tt> object has
     been detached, the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/49df0019f367">ability</a> to place
     more types (including kptrs) in arrays, and
     the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f6afdaf72af7">resilient
     split BTF mechanism</a> for more reliable type metadata in loadable
     modules.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
     system call now allows the path argument to be a null pointer when the
     <tt>AT_EMPTY_PATH</tt> flag is set.  In current kernels, instead, the
     path must be an empty string in this case; allowing null pointers
     enables the kernel to handle <tt>AT_EMPTY_PATH</tt> calls more
     efficiently. 
<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html"><tt>open_by_handle_at()</tt></a>
     system call will fail in current kernels if the caller lacks the
     ability to search the initial mount namespace; that makes it unusable
     in containers.  In 6.11, the permission checks for this system call
     have been relaxed somewhat for situations where the kernel can
     convince itself that the caller has proper access to the file in
     question; see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/620c266f3949">this
     changelog</a> for more information.
<li> Matching the behavior of most Unix systems, the Linux kernel has
     traditionally prevented writes to an executable file that is in use by
     a process somewhere in the system; that is the source of the "text
     file busy" message that some readers may have seen.  This restriction
     is intended to prevent unpleasant surprises in running programs.
     Kernel developers <a href="/Articles/866493/">have been phasing
     out</a> this restriction for a few years, mostly because it does not
     really protect anything.  As of 6.11, the kernel will no longer
     prevent writes to busy executable files; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2a010c412853">this changelog</a>
     for a lot more details.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/950569/"><tt>listmount()</tt> and
     <tt>statmount()</tt></a> system calls have been extended in a number
     of ways.  <tt>listmount()</tt> is now able to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d04bccd8c19d">list mounts in
     reverse order</a>, showing the most recent mounts first.  Both system
     calls will now work in the absence of access to the initial mount
     namespace, and both can now operate in foreign mount namespaces as
     well as in the local namespace.  <tt>statmount()</tt> has gained the
     ability to return the options with which a filesystem was mounted.
<li> Support for block drivers written in Rust has been merged; thus far,
     only the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/bc5b533b91ef"><tt>null_blk</tt>
     sample driver</a> uses this support.  Having this support in the
     mainline will make the development of actually useful block drivers in
     Rust easier, though; those can be expected to appear in future kernel
     releases.
<li> The block subsystem now supports <a href="/Articles/974578/">atomic
     write operations</a> that will write either a full set of blocks or
     none of them.  At the user-space level, the new <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt>
     flag for <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"><tt>pwritev()</tt></a>
     can be used to request atomic behavior.  <tt>statx()</tt> has been
     augmented to provide information about atomic-write capabilities for a
     given file.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c34fc6f26ab8">This
     changelog</a> has some more information.
</ul>

     article</a> for some background).
     </ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new power-sequencing subsystem charged with ensuring that
     a system's devices are brought up in the right order.  This subsystem
     is impeccably undocumented; some information can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e763c9ec71dd">this changelog</a>. 
<li> The "sloppy logic analyzer" module can turn a set of GPIO lines into a
     poor-user's logic analyzer; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7828b7bbbf20">this commit</a> for
     more information.  "<q>Note that this is a last resort analyzer which
     can be affected by latencies, non-deterministic code paths and
     non-maskable interrupts. It is called 'sloppy' for a reason. However,
     for e.g. remote development, it may be useful to get a first view and
     aid further debugging.</q>"

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>net.tcp_rto_min_us</tt> sysctl knob can be used to adjust
     the minimum retransmission timeout for TCP sockets.
<li> The <tt>ethtool</tt> utility has gained the ability for fine-tuning
     the interrupt configuration for interfaces using <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/net_dim.html">Net
     DIM</a>.  There is some minimal documentation in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f750dfe825b9">this commit</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The first changes merged for 6.11 were a new "runtime constant"
     mechanism added by Linus Torvalds.  The idea was to replace variables
     holding values, specifically the pointer to and size of the
     directory-entry (dentry) cache, that are determined at boot time and
     never changed again.  By simply stuffing those values directly into
     the instructions that use them, some overhead (a pointer load and a
     run-time shift) can be avoided.  For heavily used data structures,
     that optimization can make a measurable difference.  <p> Naturally,
     there is no documentation; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e78298556ee5">this commit</a>
     contains a dummy implementation for architectures that don't support
     the feature.  The <tt>RUNTIME_CONST()</tt> macro is used to define a
     variable that will be used as a runtime constant.  That variable must
     be set with <tt>runtime_const_init()</tt>, which will rewrite all
     instructions using it.  There are two accessors:
     <tt>runtime_const_ptr()</tt> and
     <tt>runtime_const_shift_right_32()</tt>, providing the operations
     actually needed for the dentry cache.

<li> After several attempts, there is finally <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a7ca193bc9b6">some
     documentation</a> for the iomap subsystem.

</ul>
<p>
If the normal schedule holds (and it has been a long time since it didn't),
the 6.11 merge window will close with the 6.11-rc1 release on July&nbsp;28.
There are still over 8,000 changesets sitting in linux-next, so the list of
changes for the next release is far from complete.  As always, LWN will be
back after the closing of the merge window with a summary of what the
second half brings.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
How does the kernel patch its own instructions at boot time? Does it hex-edit its own image? How does it know which offsets to change?<br>
<p>
I find this fascinating; any links to an explanation of this process would be welcome.<br>

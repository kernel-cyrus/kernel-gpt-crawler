<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 28, 2007</br>
           </div>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/259068/">Last week's discussion</a> of the
proposed <tt>indirect()</tt> system call ended with some complaints from
developers on the ugliness of the interface.  Since then there has been
some talk about system call interfaces in general, but not a whole lot of
ideas for how <tt>indirect()</tt> could be done better.
<p>
The leading alternative would be that pushed by H. Peter Anvin: rather than
use <tt>indirect()</tt> to extend a system call, simply make a new system
call with the desired additional parameters.  Then, usually, the old
implementation can be replaced with a simple stub which calls the new
version with the default values for the new parameters.  It is a simple
approach which easily maintains binary compatibility with very little
runtime cost.  Since there is no particular shortage of system call
numbers, this is a process which could go on for a long time.
<p>
The management of increasing numbers of system calls does impose a cost,
though; each one of those system calls is a user-space API which cannot
ever be broken.  The <tt>indirect()</tt> approach, instead, does not add
more system calls.  As long as the addition of parameters (with default
values of zero) is done with care, avoiding API problems should be
relatively easy to do.
<p>
There are also limits on how many parameters can be easily passed to system
calls; on most systems, that limit is around six.  Any system call requiring
more arguments must already do uncomfortable things with indirect blocks.
Creating new system calls with additional parameters will create more cases
where this sort of indirect parameter handling is required.  So the
approach used by <tt>indirect()</tt> will find itself being used, in some
form, anyway.
<p>
The key argument, though, still appears to be the syslet/threadlet
mechanism.  The ability to make any system call asynchronous has a lot of
appeal, but doing so requires some additional information - a place to
store the result of the call, if nothing else.  Asynchronous system calls,
in Linux, are, for all practical purposes, a type of indirect call.  The
proposed <tt>indirect()</tt> interface looks like it should be able to
accommodate asynchronous calls nicely - though the precise API has not,
yet, been nailed down.
<p>

As a result of all this, chances are that some form of <tt>indirect()</tt>
will find its way into the mainline - though there is still time for
somebody to come up with a better idea.
<p>

Meanwhile, the <a href="/Articles/251413/">last time</a> <tt>timerfd()</tt> was discussed here, it had been
disabled in the 2.6.23 kernel as a result of complaints about its
interface.  Since then, little has happened with <tt>timerfd()</tt>, with
the result that it will almost certainly not be present in 2.6.24 either.
Some work has been done with this system call, though, and <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/259777/">a new API proposal</a> has been
posted.  This version has three system calls, the first of which is
<tt>timerfd_create()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_create(int clockid, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>clockid</tt> argument tells the system which clock should be used:
<tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt> or <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME</tt>.  The <tt>flags</tt>
argument is a recent addition; it is currently unused and must be zero.  It
was added on the assumption that somebody, somewhere, will always want some
sort of behavior modification and one might as well avoid the need for an
indirect version while it's easy.  The return value from
<tt>timerfd_create()</tt> is a file descriptor which can be passed to
<tt>read()</tt> or any of the <tt>poll()</tt> variants.  But, first, the
timer should probably be programmed with:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_settime(int fd, 
                        int flags,
		        const struct itimerspec *timer,
		    	struct itimerspec *old_timer);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>fd</tt> is a file descriptor obtained from
<tt>timerfd_create()</tt>,
<tt>flags</tt> contains <tt>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME</tt> if the timer is being
set to an absolute time, and <tt>timer</tt> is the expiration time for the
timer.  If <tt>old_timer</tt> is not <tt>NULL</tt>, the location pointed to
will be set to the previous value of the timer.
<p>
It is also possible to query the value of the timer with:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_gettime(int fd, struct itimerspec *timer);
</pre>
<p>
The value returned in <tt>*timer</tt> will be the current setting of the
timer associated with <tt>fd</tt>.
<p>

There's not been a whole lot of comments on this version of the API, so
something very similar to it will probably be merged.  It would normally be
considered to be too late to put a change like this into 2.6.24, but the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260127/">2.6.24-rc3-mm2</a> patch log says
"Probably 2.6.24?".  So one never knows.  If this change is not merged
soon, it will  almost certainly
become available for 2.6.25.
<p>

Finally, the <tt>hijack()</tt> system call continues to be developed on
relatively quiet kernel subsystem lists.  This call (<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/256389/">described here in October</a>)
behaves much like <tt>clone()</tt> in that it creates a new process.
Unlike <tt>clone()</tt>, however, <tt>hijack()</tt> causes the new process
to share resources with a specified third process rather than with the
parent.  Its main reason for existence is to make it easy to enter
different namespaces.
<p>
The <tt>hijack()</tt> interface remains almost unchanged:
<p>
<pre>
    int hijack(unsigned long clone_flags, int which, int id);
</pre>
<p>
The specified <tt>id</tt> value is interpreted according to <tt>which</tt>,
which now has three possible values:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>HIJACK_PID</tt> says that <tt>id</tt> is a process ID; the
     newly-created process will share resources (including namespaces) with
     the indicated process.
<p>
<li> <tt>HIJACK_CG</tt> says that <tt>id</tt> is an open file descriptor
     for the <tt>tasks</tt> file in a target control group.  In this case,
     the kernel will find a process within that control group and use it as
     the source for resources and namespaces.
<p>
<li> <tt>HIJACK_NS</tt> is the newest option; like <tt>HIJACK_CG</tt>, it
     is an open file descriptor indicating a control group.  In this case,
     though, only the control group itself and any associated namespaces
     will be inherited by the new process.  This version is intended for
     use when entry into an empty control group (where there are no
     processes to inherit from) is desired.
</ul>
<p>
This new system call still has not seen any exposure on linux-kernel; it
may well not survive its first experience there in its current form.  If
nothing else, a name change (to something which is more descriptive of the
real function and, preferably, which does not put users onto intelligence
agency watch lists) may well be called for.  But a full container
implementation on Linux will clearly need some sort of
<tt>enter_container()</tt> system call at some point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p>The Linux kernel uses a large variety of &quot;atomic&quot; operations
— operations that are indivisible as observed from anywhere within the
system — to
provide safe and efficient behavior in a multi-threaded environment.  A <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/695257/">recent article</a> explained why a
new suite of atomic primitives was added but, as <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/695714/">reader "magnus" observed</a>, that
article didn't
provide any context for how these, or any other atomic operations, actually
get used.  The new operations are hardly used at all as yet, so we can only
guess how useful they might be.  More mature operations are in wide use,
and while cataloging every distinct use case would be unhelpfully tedious,
finding a few common patterns can aid understanding.  To this end, I went
searching through the Linux kernel code to find out how different atomic
operations are used and to look for examples that might shed light on the
possible usefulness of the new operations.</p>

<h4>Simple flags</h4>

<p>In general, atomic operations are only needed when multiple threads
might update the same datum in potentially different ways.  However, one of
my early exposures to the importance of atomics involved values that
weren't shared, or were only updated under a spinlock.  The RPC (remote
procedure call) layer of the NFS server uses a number of state flags, some
of which were represented at that time as <tt>unsigned char</tt> while
others were single-bit fields like:</p>

<pre>
    unsigned int sk_temp : 1,	/* temp socket */
</pre>

<p>The code that the C compiler generates to update fields like this one
will read and then write a whole machine word.
It is natural to use a lock to ensure that multiple read-modify-write
operations do not happen in parallel but, if different fields in the same
machine word are protected by different locks, these whole-word updates can
easily interfere with each other.  This code was originally safe because an
extra spinlock was used just to protect these flags from each other.  A <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?id=294d77d98b929017f6d8e3929c58ccfa189e44d7">significant
rewrite</a> of that code removed the extra spinlock and instead used
<tt>set_bit()</tt> and <tt>clear_bit()</tt> to atomically update individual
bits within a word.</p>

<p>So the first purpose of using atomic operations is isolation: ensuring that
an update to one value doesn't disturb updates to neighboring, but
unrelated, values.  A write to an aligned value of the basic machine word
size, typically 32&nbsp;bits, can be assumed not to interfere with writes to
neighboring values.  Values with a smaller size, which might be updated
concurrently with small neighbors, need some sort of protection, either
with locking or with atomic operations.</p>

<h4>Counters</h4>

<p>Of the many situations where concurrent updates to a single value can be
expected, counters are probably the simplest.  Linux uses atomic counters
to count various things including <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/md/raid1.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n2122">IO
errors</a>, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/atm/idt77252.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n1073">dropped
packets</a>, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/udl/udl_fb.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n149">CPU
cycles used</a>, and various other simple statistics.  Atomic operations are
not the most efficient way to collect statistics, so many are instead collected in
separate per-CPU counters that are only summed when needed, as is done, for
example, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/genhd.h?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n290">in
the block layer</a>.  Atomics are certainly easier, though, and when the events
being counted are not too frequent they are a good choice.</p>

<p>Counting the number of some resource that is currently in use (or
currently available) is a common use of atomics, and these use cases need
to pay careful attention to what happens when the relevant limit is
reached. <tt>jbd2</tt>, the journaling layer for ext4, tracks the blocks
committed to the next transaction (<tt>outstanding_credits</tt>) with an
atomic counter and, when the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/jbd2/transaction.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n195">commitment
exceeds a limit</a>, it simply subtracts off the last number and waits for
space to become available.  This means that the counter transiently exceeds
the maximum, which presumably is not problematic.
<p>
The XFS filesystem also
uses an atomic counter to track space commitment in the log, though in quite
a different way.  In this case, the counter is really a position in the log,
and when it reaches the end it must atomically wrap around to the
beginning.  The &quot;check for an overflow and adjust&quot; approach used
in jbd2 won't do here, so an atomic &quot;compare-exchange&quot; loop <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/xfs/xfs_log.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n146">is
used</a> to ensure only valid values are ever visible.</p>

<p>Thus a &quot;reliable counter&quot; is the second common use for atomic
operations. It can gather statistics or monitor resource usage and
sometimes impose hard limits.  A common form of counter not mentioned
yet is the reference counter.  While these are &quot;reliable
counters&quot;, they have an important role in resource ownership, and so
fit best a little later in our story.</p>

<h4>Exclusive ownership</h4>

<p>Exclusive ownership of something is a frequent pattern in the Linux
kernel, where the &quot;something&quot; might be a data structure, might be
some specific part of, or access to, a data structure, or might be a more
abstract resource.  Often spinlocks or mutexes will be used to gain
exclusive ownership but, in cases where there is no desire to wait if the
resource is 
not immediately available, an atomic operation that reports whether or not
ownership was obtained is usually the preferred approach.</p>

<p>Possibly the simplest way to gain exclusive ownership is with
<tt>test_and_set_bit_lock()</tt>.</p>

<p>
<pre>
    if (!test_and_set_bit_lock(BIT_NUM, &amp;bitmap)) {
	/* make use of exclusive ownership here */
	clear_bit_unlock(BIT_NUM, &amp;bitmap);
    } else
	/* try some other approach */
</pre>

<p>If the bit is clear and multiple threads run this code at the same time,
only one will see that the bit wasn't set, and will have successfully set
it.  All the others will see the bit already set and will know they didn't
set it and so did not gain ownership.</p>

<p>

The <tt>_lock</tt> suffix and the <tt>_unlock</tt> suffix in
<tt>clear_bit_unlock()</tt> are sometimes important and probably aren't
used as much at they should be.

<tt>test_and_set_bit_lock()</tt> and <tt>clear_bit_unlock()</tt> are
variants of the unadorned <tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> and
<tt>clear_bit()</tt> functions; they should be used when resource ownership
is being claimed as they bring both social and technical benefits.

On the social side, they serve as useful
documentation for the intent of the code.  Not all
<tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> calls claim ownership; some only need the
isolation properties of bit operations.  Similarly, not all
<tt>clear_bit()</tt> calls release ownership. Making the intention clear to
the reader can be extremely valuable.



<p>The technical value relates to the fact that the C compiler and the CPU
hardware are permitted some flexibility in re-ordering memory accesses,
providing that they don't change the behavior of a single-threaded program.
In the absence of any &quot;barriers&quot; to restrain this flexibility,
reads from memory that are textually between the &quot;set bit&quot; and
the &quot;clear bit&quot; could be performed before the bit is set, and
writes to memory could get delayed until after the bit is cleared.  This
re-ordering could allow one thread to see data that another thread is still
manipulating, which is clearly undesired.</p>

<p>Without the locking suffixes, <tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> actually
provides a full two-way barrier so that no reads or writes can be moved
from one side to the other.  This is a stronger guarantee than needed, so
<tt>test_and_set_bit_lock()</tt> can be used to just provide a one-way
barrier to reads preventing them from being performed before the bit is
set. This is referred to as an &quot;acquire&quot; semantic due to its used
in gaining ownership of something.  Conversely, <tt>clear_bit()</tt>
provides no barriers at all, so <tt>clear_bit_unlock()</tt> is needed for
correctness.  It provides a &quot;release&quot; semantic — a one-way
barrier to write requests that ensures that all writes that took place
before the clearing of the bit will be visible before cleared bit itself
is visible.</p>

<p>The different barrier behavior exhibited by the unadorned operations is
explained by the rule that atomic operations that return a value
(such as <tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt>) generally
impose full memory barriers, while atomic operations that don't return a
value (<tt>clear_bit()</tt>, for example) generally impose no barriers at
all.</p> 

<p>This need to be careful about memory barriers is one of the costs of
using atomics rather than the safer (but slower) spinlocks.  It used to be
worse though.  Prior to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=26333576fd0d0b52f6e4025c5aded97e188bdd44">2007</a>
there was no <tt>clear_bit_unlock()</tt>, so explicit barriers such as
<tt>smp_mb__after_clear_bit()</tt> would need to be carefully placed to
avoid races.  Thankfully, that delightfully named function has long been
deprecated and barriers are now usually integrated with the operation they
protect.  Many atomic operations are available with a variety of suffixes
that indicate different ordering semantics, including <tt>_acquire</tt>,
<tt>_release</tt>,
<tt>_relaxed</tt> (which provides no ordering guarantees at all),
and <tt>_mb</tt> (which gives a full memory barrier).  As a general rule,
these interfaces should probably be 
avoided unless you really know what you are doing.  Even people who do know
what they are doing can have <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/9/721">long conversations</a> about the
issues.</p>

<p>One pleasing example of using bit operations for exclusive access in the
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/block/cciss.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n979"><tt>cmd_alloc()</tt>
function</a> is the <tt>cciss</tt> disk array driver.  The driver maintains
a pool 
of &quot;commands&quot; and a bitmap showing which commands are in use.
It uses <tt>find_first_zero_bit()</tt> to find an available command, and
then <tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> to claim it.  On failure, it just goes
back to choose another command from the pool.
This code could be made a little more readable by using
<tt>test_and_set_bit_lock()</tt> and <tt>clear_bit_unlock()</tt>, but
there is no reason to think the current code is not safe.

</p>

<p>I chose that example to contrast it with <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/powerpc/platforms/pasemi/dma_lib.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n146"><tt>pasemi_alloc_rx_chan()</tt></a>,
which performs similar allocations from a pool, but with some differences: the
bitmap identifies free resources, <tt>find_first_bit()</tt> is used to find
one, and <tt>test_and_clear_bit()</tt> is used to claim it.  There is no
<tt>test_and_clear_bit_lock()</tt> or <tt>set_bit_unlock()</tt> so this
code cannot self-document the use of the bits for locking, and we must hope
there is no room for races around the <tt>set_bit()</tt> that releases the
lock.</p>

<h4>Counters and pointers for exclusive ownership</h4>

<p>One of the surprises I found while exploring the kernel was the number
of drivers that used an <tt>atomic_t</tt> counter purely to gain exclusive
access.  These drivers, such as <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/s390/block/dasd.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n2111"><tt>dasd</tt></a>,
a storage driver for IBM s390 systems, use <tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt> much like
<tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> so, for example:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    if (atomic_cmpxchg (&amp;device-&gt;tasklet_scheduled, 0, 1) != 0)
	return;
</pre>

<p>will only continue to subsequent code if exclusive access was gained to
whatever <tt>tasklet_scheduled</tt> protects.  One reason that might
justify this unusual construct is that the smallest bitmap that can be used
with <tt>test_and_set_bit()</tt> and related functions is a single unsigned
long integer, which is eight bytes on 64-bit architectures.  In contrast,
the value that <tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt> operates on is an
<tt>atomic_t</tt>, which is only four bytes.  Whether this small space
saving justifies that non-standard code is a question we must leave to the
individual developers to consider.</p>

<p>This space saving is one of the possible benefits of the new
<tt>atomic_fetch*()</tt> operations.  <tt>atomic_fetch_or()</tt> can be
used to test and set any arbitrary bit in an <tt>atomic_t</tt> and
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/time/tick-sched.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n294">this is
the use case</a> for two of the three call sites that are currently in the
kernel. 
When an exclusive ownership is being requested, it would be better to use
<tt>atomic_fetch_or_acquire()</tt> to document that intent.  This currently
produces identical code, but that may change.</p>

<p>A variation of exclusive ownership that requires a counter can be seen
when the counter is used to identify a state in a state machine.  A
transition from one state to the next may require some particular action to
be performed by precisely one thread.  This pattern can be seen in quite a
few network device drivers, though the first I came across was in the core
code for Firewire devices.  A Firewire device can transition from
&quot;initializing&quot; to &quot;running&quot; to &quot;gone&quot; to
&quot;shutdown&quot;.  Most of these transitions use
<tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt> to avoid races and to detect which thread first
made a particular transition.  If the test:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    if (atomic_cmpxchg(&amp;device-&gt;state,
	    	       FW_DEVICE_RUNNING,
		       FW_DEVICE_INITIALIZING) == FW_DEVICE_RUNNING) {
</pre>

<p>succeeds, then some extra work, which is needed when the device first
starts running, can be performed.</p>

<p>A particularly common case that uses counters for a form of exclusive
ownership are the various providers of unique serial numbers. <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/md/dm.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n2405"><tt>dm_next_uevent_seq()</tt></a>
is just one example of more than a dozen that I found before losing
interest.  These atomically increment a value and return that value for
local use.  The caller is certain to be the only caller to be given that
particular value, so they can be seen as having exclusive ownership of it.
Of the ten places Davidlohr Bueso found to use the newly introduced
<tt>atomic_fetch_inc()</tt>, seven were
for unique serial numbers where there was a desire for the first number to
be zero — <tt>atomic_inc_return()</tt> naturally starts by returning one.
A similar simplification could be achieved by initializing the atomic
counter to <tt>-1</tt>.</p>

<p>Atomic pointer updates are sometimes used to gain exclusive ownership,
though with a slightly different understanding of the ownership concept.
IPv6 supports a number of sub-protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
Handlers for these individual protocols can register themselves using <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/ipv6/protocol.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n31"><tt>inet6_add_protocol()</tt></a>,
which uses the <tt>cmpxchg()</tt> atomic function to install the provided
handler into the table of protocol pointers.  If a protocol was already
registered, this fails.  If not, the caller gains ownership of that
particular protocol number and can continue as the registered handler.</p>

<p>A similar <tt>cmpxchg()</tt> to atomically replace a <tt>NULL</tt> with
a pointer occurs in multiple places in the kernel such as in the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/tty/tty_audit.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n172"><tt>tty_audit</tt>
code</a> and in the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/btrfs/raid56.c?id=fa8410b355251fd30341662a40ac6b22d3e38468#n196">Btrfs
<tt>raid56</tt> code</a>.  Both of these install a newly allocated and
initialized data structure for multiple threads to access.  In the unlikely
event that two threads find they need to create it at the same time, they
might both prepare the structure but only one will successfully install it.
The other must discard its structure as wasted effort.  Here exclusive access is
gained for &quot;the right to initialize&quot;, which may seem to be a
slightly contorted way to look at things, but does allow the formation of a
uniform pattern.</p>

<h4>Shared ownership — for another day</h4>

<p>The obvious sequel to exclusive ownership is the shared ownership
provided by reference counters.  This topic has been <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/336224/">covered before</a>, so there is
little point in more than a cursory review.  However, a careful examination
of one of the patterns found previously opens up a whole new collection of
patterns and provides a hint at another possible use of the new
<tt>atomic_fetch_*()</tt> operations.  These topics will be covered in the
companion article to this one.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In general, atomic operations are only needed when multiple threads might update the same datum in potentially different ways.</font><br>
<p>
This is not true in general. In a setting such as C or C++, atomic operations are only needed when multiple threads might *access* the same datum concurrently, where "concurrently" means not already ordered by some other piece of code or rule in the language's memory model (e.g., in C11 concurrently would mean "not ordered by happens-before"). This is important because otherwise, one is making the implicit assumption that loads are atomic, which often happens to be the case but is not generally true (e.g., because it disallows reloading the value, as could be done by the code generated by the compiler).<br>
<p>
It is also important to remember that due to using a high-level programming language, one is interfacing with the language's semantics first (and thus the compiler, which is part of the implementation of this semantics).  The bitfield case you describe is a good example of that.  The Linux kernel is making assumptions about what a compiler would do that go beyond what is required by the actual language semantics, so one should at least be aware of those assumptions.  IMO, it is better to remember when/where one would need atomics in general, and then apply those assumptions (e.g., by using plain memory accesses when atomic ones would be required in general), instead of believing that these assumptions are universal.<br>
Whether these assumptions are good assumptions is another discussion, and languages (e.g., C11) or other projects (e.g., where glibc is heading) make different assumptions.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 18, 2008</br>
           </div>
The containers developers have what would seem to be a relatively
straightforward problem: they would like to control access to devices on a
per-container basis.  Then containers could safely be granted access to
specific devices without compromising the overall security of the system -
even if a container has a root-capable process which can create new device
files.  Implementing this feature has been a longer journey than these
developers had imagined, though, with the "device whitelist" feature being
sent around to different kernel subsystems almost like one of those famous
garbage barges from years past.  A final resting place may have been found, though, and it
may signal a change in how some security decisions are made in the kernel
in the future.
<p>

The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/271823/">original version</a> of the
patch, posted by Pavel Emelyanov, set up a control group for the management
of device accessibility within containers.  The actual rules - and their
enforcement - were stored deep within the device model subsystem.  This
drew an objection from Greg Kroah-Hartman, who suggested that, instead,
this kind of access control should done either with udev or with the Linux
security module (LSM) subsystem.  Udev does not give the desired degree of
control and, apparently, can be problematic for those wanting to run older
distributions within containers, so it was not seriously considered.  The
LSM suggestion was, after some resistance, taken to heart, though.
<p>

The result was the  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/273208/">device
whitelist LSM patch</a>, posted by Serge Hallyn.  It was a stacking
security module which made changes to a number of hooks.  This is where
James Morris <a href="/Articles/273825/">came in</a> and suggested that,
instead, the whitelist should just be added to the existing capabilities
security module.  Then there would be no need for a separate module and
things could be generally simplified.
<p>

So Serge duly rolled out <a href="/Articles/273826/">version 3 of the
patch</a> which moved the whitelist into the capabilities module.  But this
one ran into resistance as well.  <a href="/Articles/273827/">Quoting James
Morris</a> again:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Moving this logic into LSM means that instead of the cgroups
	security logic being called from one place in the main kernel
	(where cgroups lives), it must be called identically from each LSM
	(none of which are even aware of cgroups), which I think is pretty
	obviously the wrong solution.
</div>
<p>
Casey Schaufler also <a href="/Articles/273828/">didn't like this idea</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	When the next feature comes along are we going to stuff it into
	capabilities, too? Maybe we'll cram it into audit or CIPSO instead,
	but how long can this go on?  Eventually we need a mechanism that
	allows more or less general mix-and-match, maybe with a few rules
	like "don't mix plaids and stripes" to keep things sane or these
	lesser facilities have no chance. Seems like we're still making LSM
	too hard to use
</div>
<p>
At this point, the complaint was clearly not with just the device
whitelist, but with the capabilities module as well.  It seems that
capabilities are a bit of a poor fit with the LSM idea as a whole.  The
fact that they exist at all is a bit of a historical artifact; some
developers wanted to see them implemented that way to show the flexibility
of the LSM interface and to let capabilities be omitted from embedded
setups.  As it happens, it's still not possible to remove capabilities, and
they impose a bit of a cost on all other security modules.
<p>

The core problem is this: LSM, fundamentally, is a restrictive mechanism.  An
LSM hook can deny an action, but it can never empower a process to do
something it would not have been allowed to do in the absence of the
security module.  The decision to disallow "authoritative hooks" was <a
href="http://lwn.net/2001/1108/kernel.php3">made explicitly back in
2001</a> as a way of restricting the scope of LSM modules and, hopefully,
ensuring that those modules would not themselves become security problems.
<p>

But capabilities are an inherently authoritative mechanism - a capability
check verifies the existence of a special permission which would otherwise
not be there.  The device whitelist is the same sort of thing: it grants
access which would otherwise be denied.  So it fits poorly with the LSM
model.
<p>

Serge came back with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/273702/">yet another
patch</a> which takes the whitelist code out of the LSM framework and,
instead, inserts a separate set of hooks into the relevant places in the
code.  Those hooks sit right next to the LSM hooks, but operate in a
permissive manner.  So far, this approach seems to be passing muster, with
no developers (yet) talking about booting it out into yet another
subsystem.
<p>

Things may yet change, though.  Casey Schaufler is now <a
href="/Articles/273830/">talking about</a> the creation of a "Linux
privilege module" framework for the management of all permissions checks.
The normal discretionary access control checks could be moved there, as
could all capability and "are they root?" logic.  And, of course, the
device whitelist code.  Nobody has really spoken out against this idea -
but, then, nobody has seen any code yet either.  But, if things continue in
this direction, authoritative hooks may have finally found a home, many
years after having been rejected from the LSM mechanism.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

From the article, it seems LSM is seen as a way to restrict a user's rights from an original
set, where I think it should be a way to say who can do what.

Each user could then have a tick-box kind of configuration, which is in fact similar to making
a user part of a group to give them access to a category of devices.

But I suppose the all idea now would be to say like: user A cannot access /dev/sda* (the hard
disk), but can access /dev/sdb* (a USB key that is known to belong to them).

Correct?

Perhaps this consolidation will also pave the way for the inclusion of Niels Provos' <a href="http://www.systrace.org/">systrace</a> patches.
</p><p>
Systrace implements a brilliant, elegant, approach to security, by allowing any user to interpose a set of "firewall" rules between the code that they run and the kernel (via the system call APIs).
</p><p>
This approach is vastly simpler than SELinux, which loads up the system with a large number of additional labels (domains, types, roles), and which add additional options to many commands (the -Z flags to <i>ls, ps</i>, etc.) and is generally impossible for mere mortal to comprehend
</p><p>
Systrace allows a normal user to create a policy and limit the access by programs, without giving the user any additional systems level permissions beyond what he or she already had.  (It essentially uses the <i>ptrace</i> mechanism).  So a user can, for example, run Mozilla while restricting it read/write <i>open()</i> calls to just the ~/.mozilla and ~/Downloads directories.  In that example a compromised Mozilla can only write to those two directories and can't plant a trojan in your ~/bin directory, for example.
</p><p>
Another advantage of systrace is that it's already included in NetBSD and OpenBSD, and available for OpenSolaris, and FreeBSD.  That makes it the only viable security enhancement to UNIX-like systems which is cross-platform.

Hm.  Systrace site says this on security:
"Just keep in mind that ptrace has not been designed as a security 
primitive and while the ptrace backend can restrict the behavior of 
programs in non-adversarial settings, there are many ways to circumvent 
it."

Maybe ltrace (new kernel implementation for ptrace that is supposed to 
solve many of its problems) could help also on this?

You mean Roland McGrath's utrace?

While incredibly nifty and a long-overdue revamp of the awful ptrace() 
interface, utrace hasn't been designed as a security enforcement mechanism 
either :)

(however, things like UML are in effect using it as such in any case, so 
security-hole-inducing bugs in ptrace() *are* likely to get fixed.)

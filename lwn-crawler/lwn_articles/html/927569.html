The kernel's hierarchical maintainer model works quite well from the
standpoint of allowing thousands of developers to work together without
(often) stepping on each others' toes.  But that model can also make life
painful for developers who are trying to make changes across numerous
subsystems.  Other possible source of pain include changes related to
licensing or those where maintainers don't understand the purpose of the
work.  Nick Alcock has managed to hit all of those hazards together in his
effort to perform what would seem like a common-sense cleanup of the
kernel's annotations for loadable modules.
<p>
<h4>Discovering potential modules</h4>
<p>
Alcock did not set out to make tree-wide changes; he is, instead, working
on adding some improved tracing features to the kernel.  In order to
provide a consistent interface to users, he needs to be able to discover
code that, as a result of the kernel configuration, is built into the
kernel, but which <i>could</i> also have been configured as a loadable module.
He <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/87h6z5wqlk.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">described</a>
the motivation as:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The reason: if your tracer or whatever has a distinct notation used
	by users for things in named modules, then you'd usually like to
	keep that notation the same if you choose to build something into
	the kernel that might otherwise be a module. Things that cannot be
	built as modules could just use the in-the-core-kernel notation
	unconditionally, because there's no way they can ever be found
	anywhere else: and users are likely to expect that. At least, when
	I broke it in DTrace years ago, I got complaints!
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, he is trying to treat kernel symbols in possibly modular
code consistently regardless of whether that code is configured as a module
in any given kernel build.  In theory, this determination should not be
hard to make; the kernel build process <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/kbuild.html">produces a
file called <tt>modules.builtin</tt></a> that is described as listing
"<q>all modules that are built into the kernel</q>".  This file exists for
a specific purpose: allowing the <tt>modprobe</tt> command to recognize a
request to load a module that is already built into the kernel, do nothing
in response, and complete successfully.  It would seem that
<tt>modules.builtin</tt> is exactly what Alcock is looking for, except that
the contents of this file are not exactly as described.
<p>
Prior to the 5.6 release in early 2020, the build system would pass through
each subsystem's <tt>Kconfig</tt> file to generate a list of potentially
modular code that had been configured to be built into the kernel image
directly.  This mechanism worked, but it required a pass over the source
tree, slowing the build process.  So the maintainer of the kernel build
system, Masahiro Yamada, decided to find a way to simplify and accelerate
the generation of <tt>modules.builtin</tt>.
<p>
The solution that emerged was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8b41fc4454e3">this commit</a>, which
took out the old machinery.  In its place was a modification to one of the
macros used to describe loadable modules.  These macros have names like
<tt>MODULE_AUTHOR()</tt>, <tt>MODULE_DESCRIPTION()</tt>, and
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>; each of them adds information to a special
section in the compiled module that can be used by tools like
<tt>modprobe</tt>.  <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>, in particular, declares the
license under which the module can be distributed; it is used primarily to
control whether the module will have access to the GPL-only symbols within
the kernel when it is loaded.
<p>
The <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> declaration is mandatory; a kernel module
cannot be loaded without it.  Since this declaration must appear in code
that can be built as a module, Yamada decided to overload it as an
indication that, indeed, a modular build is possible.  So, in kernels
starting with the 5.6 release, <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> adds an extra line
to the compiled code indicating that it is part of a module; the build
process can then scan the resulting object files for that line and collate
the results into the new <tt>modules.builtin</tt> file.
<p>
The problem with this approach was noted by Yamada in the commit message:
there is code in the kernel that contains <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>
declarations, but which cannot be built as a module.  Each of those
occurrences causes a misleading line to be added to
<tt>modules.builtin</tt>, describing a "built-in" module that is not, in
fact, a module.  For the purpose of allowing <tt>modprobe</tt> to recognize
built-in modules, these false lines are not a problem; <tt>modprobe</tt>
will simply ignore them.  But, if one is trying to generate an accurate
list of subsystems that truly can be built as modules, those lines are a
problem indeed.
<p>
<h4>The beginning of the cleanup</h4>
<p>
In November 2022, Alcock posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221109134132.9052-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">a
patch series</a> that attempted to detect possible modules by adding a new
build-time pass to create a new file called <tt>modules_thick.builtin</tt>,
which would contain information that his work needs.  Luis Chamberlain, the
maintainer of the kernel's module loader, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y2x22mKtaZvC7ZSk@bombadil.infradead.org/">suggested</a>
using an augmented version of <tt>modules.builtin</tt> instead.  That, in
turn, brought the problem described above to light.  Alcock eventually <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87sfics595.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">asked</a> whether he
should go through the kernel tree and remove all of the <tt>MODULE_*</tt>
declarations found in non-modular code; Chamberlain <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y3vNs41m9I51Eu7x@bombadil.infradead.org/">answered</a>
"<q>100% yes</q>" and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y3vPGDmKVx3UWbwJ@bombadil.infradead.org/">offered</a>
to send the resulting changes upstream via the modules tree.
<p>
Thus began the journey to clean up the kernel's module annotations.  In
early December, Alcock showed up with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221205163157.269335-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">a
patch set</a> performing the removals; it also added some machinery to the
build process to detect and warn about spurious <tt>MODULE_*</tt>
declarations in an attempt to prevent the problem from coming back.
Neither of those efforts went well.
<p>
Geert Uytterhoeven <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAMuHMdVrP1sLGRS999q=2L-5JhxXwcjBLkQREdcJhDerg70OtA@mail.gmail.com/">complained</a>
about the removal of the non-license information, saying that it is
"<q>useful information, in an easy-to-parse format</q>" that should remain.
He also said that some of the affected code might be made modular in the
future, at which time that information would be needed.  Alcock quickly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87mt80l2py.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">agreed</a> that only
the <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> lines really needed to be deleted.  But Arnd
Bergmann, perhaps not understanding the actual problem being addressed, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/5f0a5ea7-2d48-435f-aaa0-82b6ef8cfcc5@app.fastmail.com/">said</a>
that the license information, too, should remain if it isn't actively
wrong.  Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y5BNCbFyvNA1Xp/X@infradead.org/">suggested</a> that
the <a href="/Articles/739183/">SPDX identifiers</a> found in the kernel
source should be used to generate the license information directly — a
potentially nice idea but not a small task.
<p>
Meanwhile, Yamada <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNAQLttPD=Ae==e0CYeQtS78=o_JZFK+zxa29JnUYio52Ug@mail.gmail.com/">rejected</a>
the build-system changes, saying "<q>Please do not come back with this again.
NACK.</q>"  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAK7LNASpkAY=t3uOmehTDD7o1-MY9Kzm1C=V2+i0XhHmjjJdUQ@mail.gmail.com/">added</a>
that "<q>false-positives in modules.builtin should be OK</q>", ignoring the
discussion of why those false positives are problematic.
<p>
As a result, Alcock gave up on the build-system changes, and reduced his
other patches to commenting out the spurious <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>
entries.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230210164749.368998-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">first
set</a>, a toe-in-the-water exercise restricted to PCI drivers, was sent in
February.  PCI maintainer Bjorn Helgaas promptly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230213225723.GA2941414@bhelgaas/">complained</a>
that the subject lines did not match the PCI subsystem's conventions (a
problem frequently encountered in tree-wide patch sets, and one that Alcock
would hear about from multiple maintainers), and asked that the
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> lines be removed entirely rather than just
commented out.  Alcock duly started removing those lines thereafter.
<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZAoGpW+TnpRPMRdR@kroah.com/">responded</a> to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230217141059.392471-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">the
second set</a> by saying that <i>all</i> of the <tt>MODULE_*</tt>
declarations should be removed if any are — matching what Alcock had
initially tried to do and contradicting the advice he had gotten from other
maintainers.  Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZAoGAj3sRXKYzwc2@kroah.com/">reiterated</a> the
complaint in response to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230228130215.289081-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">the
fifth set of removals</a>, saying also that the kernel build system should
be fixed rather than taking out the license declarations.  In response to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230302211759.30135-1-nick.alcock@oracle.com/">the
sixth set</a>, Chamberlain also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZAJzCvTI67NgbJiY@bombadil.infradead.org/">suggested</a>
removing all of the module declarations; Alcock <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87ilevu1q6.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">answered</a> that,
beyond the complaints he had gotten from others, some of those declarations
(such as <tt>MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()</tt>) have side effects that prevent
their removal.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman also showed up in response to the sixth set, arguing more
forcefully against its inclusion.  He once again <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZArc0ib697JIwKou@kroah.com/">complained</a> about
removing only the <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> statements, and said:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Just change the macros to work properly in both cases, I can't
	believe this is all that hard as obviously all of the other macros
	work both ways, right?  That should not require any kbuild changes.
</blockquote>
<p>
Once again, this statement suggests a failure to understand the real
problem that is being solved or the special semantics that Yamada had given
to <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> in 5.6.  There are no "both cases" for code that
cannot be built as a module, and simply disabling <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>
for a non-modular build of a subsystem would break the generation of
<tt>modules.builtin</tt> entirely.
<p>
The conversation did not stop there, though; Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZB2zrHSzmi8FXABI@kroah.com/">insisted</a> that
"<q>some of us disagree that this should be done at all</q>" and asked that
the license information that had been deleted so far be restored: "<q>it is
not a good idea to remove that if the file does not have a SPDX entry at
the very least</q>".  The idea that a <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> line might
actually define the license for a source file raises a number of concerns
of its own, of course; deleting license information is generally frowned
upon.  But it is far from clear, as we will see, that
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> fills that role.
<p>
<h4>Removals removed</h4>
<p>
Be that as it may, Chamberlain, who had asked for this work to be done in
the first place, and who had been applying the removals to the modules
tree, summarily <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZB3mw4G8GdGwSP41@bombadil.infradead.org/">dropped
them all</a>, telling Alcock to "<q>only re-submit only for files where the
license is clear</q>".  Alcock <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87tty6lbed.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">responded with a
license audit</a> for the files in question, concluding that the situation
is "<q>a right mess</q>".  Some files have SPDX tags; others do not.  Some
of them have SPDX tags that contradict the <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>
declaration in the same file.  A <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> declaration, it
would seem, is not a particularly reliable guide to the actual license
attached to the source containing that declaration.
<p>
Alcock suggested that, perhaps, for files with unclear licensing,
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> could be turned into a new
<tt>NONMODULE_LICENSE()</tt> macro, essentially returning to commenting out
the declaration and preserving the information.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZCGBfbZztfBpgIXf@kroah.com/">answered</a> that,
actually, the SPDX lines and <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> cover different
things: the former describes the license for the file in which it is found,
while the latter provides the license for the built binary module.  But the
"<q>license stuff</q>" is "<q>secondary</q>", he said; the real problem
remains the removal of just the <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> lines.  He
suggested again that Alcock should be "<q>just stubbing out
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt></q>" for non-modular builds — a "solution" that
misses the problem entirely.
<p>
That message also said: "<q>I'm confused why you picked the license line to
trigger all of this</q>".  Alcock <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87355qnt27.fsf@esperi.org.uk/">answered</a>, clearly
frustrated, that Yamada had attached the special meaning to
<tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt>, and that Kroah-Hartman was "<q>really objecting
to the consequences of a years-old commit that I didn't write</q>".  He
explained the whole story once again.
As of this writing, that is where things stand; Kroah-Hartman has not
responded to Alcock's explanation.
<p>
How all of this will be resolved is far from clear.  Chamberlain is now <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZCOnhIiU2w2+Txxm@bombadil.infradead.org/">advising</a>
Alcock to take on the project of adding proper SPDX lines to the relevant
files that lack them as a step toward automatic generation of the module
license declaration.  This is a significant and fraught task; assigning a
license to somebody else's code is not something to be done lightly.  It's
worth noting that Chamberlain sees this as a path toward removing
<i>all</i> <tt>MODULE_LICENSE()</tt> declarations, of which there are over
11,000 in the kernel; that is not a small number of SPDX tags to check.  A
lot of work is being requested here that is orthogonal to Alcock's actual
objectives.
<p>
Tree-wide changes are
always painful to make; they tend to run afoul of the differing
expectations of subsystem maintainers and, in any case, it is always hard
to get a group of kernel maintainers to agree on anything.  But the task
gets significantly harder when multiple maintainers obstruct things
without, seemingly, understanding the problem that is being solved.  The
tendency of maintainers to add requirements, such as figuring out what the
licensing of kernel subsystems should really be, also does not help.  It
all adds up to a frustrating experience for a developer who is just trying
to fix a problem so that he can get back to work on his real project.  The
kernel development process, as a whole, works quite well, but there are
clearly situations where significant room for improvement exists.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

We did, at the last LPC. Everyone seemed happy -- then.<br>
<p>
btw, there is actually a genuine problem with the old approach that Yamada removed in 2020: because it depends on redefining all CONFIG_ variables to contain an uppercase value, it falls foul of code scattered across the makefiles that relies on them being lowercase (to do things like building code into the kernel if something is built as a module, perhaps as some kind of shim). It's not one that anyone else ever noticed, because with no way to verify that the contents of modules.builtin were correct, it all went unnoticed in the flood of correct output. With *two* ways to generate the output (the old approach driven from tristate lines, and the new one from .modinfo), each could be validated against the other and a bunch of bugs fell out, unfortunately including 100+ extraneous MODULE_LICENSE lines...<br>

The end goal of all this is to make it possible, when symbols are shown in trace output or specified as *input* to things like DTrace probes, to be sure that the symbol is unambiguously denoted even if it's inlined in hundreds of places, or a static function with a dozen definitions. This seems to me to be fairly important for tracer usage.<br>
<p>
Here's the link to the LPC talk: &lt;<a href="https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1379/">https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1379/</a>&gt;. This is now implemented, and I have a not-yet-shown-to-anyone patch making ftrace use it (for output, anyway). (perf is fighting back but I shall prevail.)<br>

      <p>Our humble editor/author may have just hooked me with his dramatic telling, but it seems to me like Mr. Alcock is on a real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#Summary">hero's journey</a>.</p>

<p>I hope his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#Supernatural_Aid">Supernatural Aid</a> shows up soon.</p>

<p>Or suffice it to say: a lesser man like me would have succumbed already. Bless his fortitude</p>

Don't heroes' journeys require the hero to *die* at least once, and then come back to life? I'm sure I can manage the first part. Not so sure about the second.<br>
<p>
I also don't really want my mentor to die, which is very common in heroes' journeys.<br>

(And... doesn't Jon count as supernatural aid? At the very least a spontaneously emitted LWN article of this nature sounds like it should be something of the kind. I don't want Jon to die either.)<br>

"Lesser"?  I mean no disrespect to Mr. Alcock, but I don't think refusing to suffer this type of repeated abuse by maintainers would make someone lesser.  This article paints the kernel community as an extremely toxic working environment and the kernel maintainers as clueless jerks.<br>
<p>
Shame on these jerks for not bothering to understand the problem.  Shame on these jerks for giving orders to Mr. Alcock when they do not understand the problem.  And, shame on these jerks for saying Mr. Alcock has to donate his time to solving a problem completely unrelated to the one he wants to solve just so that Mr. Alcock can have the privilege of having his donation of a solution the problem he wants to solve accepted by them.<br>
<p>
I do not suffer fools, and I do not consider myself lesser for refusing to suffer fools.  The kernel's maintainers have repeatedly acted like fools to Mr. Alcock, and he has had to suffer for it.  If Mr. Alcock decides to tell the kernel community to shove it and use his talents somewhere else, I believe he would be in no way lesser for doing so.<br>
<p>
I _DID_ walk away from the kernel community in the past.  I wrote a mode for the network bonding driver that sent more packets on links that had higher capacity.  I posted it to the appropriate mailing list, demands for revisions were made, and I said, "if I meet this subset of demands, would that be good enough to get this accepted?"  Because, even 8 years ago, the kernel community had a reputation for trying to extract unrelated work out of developers who wanted to solve a particular problem, and I was wary of falling victim to that.  I either got a "no", or no response, and then I asked if it would be okay to put a comment linking to the out-of-tree patch in the source since I wasn't willing to do the additional work they wanted.  The answer?  "No."  Fine.  It's still on my website if anyone wants it: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://moongate.ydns.eu/bond_mode_batman.patch">http://moongate.ydns.eu/bond_mode_batman.patch</a><br>
<p>
Setting boundaries is healthy.  Kernel maintainers do not get to dictate how I spend my time.  The module I wrote did what I needed for my use case, and, if the kernel maintainers did not want to accept my donation, I was perfectly free to walk away.  So I did.  The module is still in use, by me, for the purpose I wrote it for, although it is likely I will soon no longer need it due to advances in WiFi over the last 8 years.<br>
<p>
Of course, when I walked away, I was warned how much trouble it would be to maintain the patch out-of-tree.  No, dudes: I'm still running the same kernel on those systems that I was running 8 years ago.  No maintenance required!<br>
<p>
I was not treated _BADLY_ by the maintainers, but perhaps that was because I walked away early on rather than trying to do what they wanted.  Perhaps, if I did do what they wanted, there would have been escalating demands.  That's what I was afraid of, and that's certainly what happened to Mr. Alcock.<br>

      The article was not intended to portray anybody as a "clueless jerk"; if you think an environment is toxic, you'll not improve it by throwing around insults like that.
<p>
The point of the article was that cross-tree changes are hard in a project of this size and structure, and that misunderstandings abound.  My hope was that shining some light would help to resolve the situation; I'm not sure that I have been successful on that front, but time will tell.

I don't think it came over as that. On the contrary.<br>
<p>
The situation illustrates one point, though: to fit one's contribution into a community work, there are extra costs. Sometimes (as in the current case) they seem outrageous, because processes or structures are at odds with that particular case.<br>
<p>
Kudos to Mr. Alcock for sticking with it. And kudos to you for analysing things in such an even-headed way as ever. That's the only way to improve things.<br>
<p>
Blaming stuff on others is the best way to stay "out of tree".<br>

I may misunderstand the article, but since the original sin is overloading MODULE_LICENSE to mean two different things, would not it be possible to just copy all existing MODULE_LICENSE declarations into MODULE_BIKESHED lines, and then untangle the uses of MODULE_LICENSE  and MODULE_BIKESHED  so each of them serves a single purpose everyone understands and agrees on ?<br>
<p>
That seems an easier sell than trying to complexify the effects of MODULE_LICENSE and then complain there is no maintainer understanding of buy-in for the new state of affairs.<br>
<p>
It’s counterproductive to be overly subtle and clever when working with lots of people who have other things to do.<br>

Much thanks to Luis for pushing the less-contentious majority of these changes in in the end: &lt;<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-modules/ZEbkqq1tvm1WHVHw@bombadil.infradead.org/T/#u">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-modules/ZEbkqq1tvm1WHVHw@bo...</a>&gt;. The nature of this is that it's increasingly useful the more is done: 100% coverage right away is definitely not required. So this is a huge step towards having this info always available.<br>
<p>
(I have not given up, even though I've gone quiet: I'm just off doing other stuff in userspace for a while. I'll be back, since kallmodsyms still needs its cover letters and commit logs rendered comprehensible to people who aren't me and generally needs looking at again. And once that's done, there's CTF support...)<br>

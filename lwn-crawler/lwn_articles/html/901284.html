One of the key selling points of the BPF subsystem is that loading a BPF
program is safe: the BPF verifier ensures that the program cannot hurt the
kernel before allowing the load to occur.  That guarantee is perhaps
losing some of its force as more 
capabilities are made available to BPF programs but, even so, it may be a
bit surprising to see <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220711083220.2175036-1-asavkov@redhat.com/">this
proposal from Artem Savkov</a> adding a BPF helper that is explicitly designed to
crash the system.  If this patch set is merged in something resembling its
current form, it will be the harbinger of a new era where BPF programs are,
in some situations at least, allowed to be overtly destructive.
<p>
As Savkov notes, one of the major use cases for BPF is kernel debugging, a
task which is also often helped by the existence of a well-timed crash
dump.  By making the kernel's <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18.11/source/kernel/panic.c#L178"><tt>panic()</tt></a>
function available to BPF programs, 
Savkov is trying to combine the two by allowing a BPF program to cause a
crash — and create a crash dump — when it detects the conditions that
indicate a problem that a developer is looking for.  Savkov is seemingly
not the only one wanting this capability; Jiri Olsa <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YswAqrJrMKIZPpcz@krava/">noted</a> that he has
gotten a request for this feature as well.
<p>
Making <tt>panic()</tt> available to BPF has some obvious hazards, so one
would expect that there would be some guard rails put into place.  In this
case, the first step is a new flag, <tt>BPF_F_DESTRUCTIVE</tt>, that must
be provided when a program that will invoke destructive operations (such as
a <tt>panic()</tt> call) is loaded.  If this flag is not present, the BPF
verifier will reject the loading of a program that contains calls to any
destructive helper functions, of which <tt>panic()</tt> is the only one (so
far). 
<p>
Even then, the <tt>panic()</tt> helper function is only available to
tracing programs.  It makes little sense, after all, for an <a
href="/Articles/759188/">infrared decoder</a> to be able to panic the system,
though this restriction will prevent a complete implementation in BPF for
remote controls featuring a "panic" button.  Then, there is a new sysctl knob
(<tt>kernel.destructive_bpf_enabled</tt>) that must be set to a non-zero
value; otherwise the <tt>panic()</tt> call will not be allowed.  Even when
the sysctl knob has been set, the process on whose behalf the BPF program
is running must have the <tt>CAP_SYS_BOOT</tt> capability.
<p>
All told, it seems unlikely that a BPF program will panic the system by
mistake.
<p>
There does not appear to be much in the way of opposition to this patch,
though there were some questions about the details.  For example, Song Liu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAPhsuW7xTRpLf1kyj5ejH0fV_aHCMQjUwn-uhWeNytXedh4+TQ@mail.gmail.com/">disliked
the sysctl knob</a> "<q>as it is global, and
the user can easily forget to turn it back off</q>".  Alexei Starovoitov
also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAADnVQ+ju04JAqyEbA_7oVj9uBAuL-fUP1FBr_OTygGf915RfQ@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that a sysctl is not called for in this situation; the
<tt>CAP_SYS_BOOT</tt> check should be enough, he said.  Starovoitov also
questioned the need for a full panic of the system, given that there are
more direct ways to create a crash dump.  Savkov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Ys7JL9Ih3546Eynf@wtfbox.lan/">replied</a> that
<tt>panic()</tt> is "<q>more versatile</q>" and that the system's response
to a panic is configurable by the administrator.  He did agree to remove
the sysctl knob.
<p>
Starovoitov also suggested implementing the functionality as <a
href="/Articles/856005/">a kfunc</a> rather than as a BPF helper.  The
reasoning here is that kfuncs are deemed to be unstable and can be removed
at any time if they turn out to be a bad idea, while removal of BPF helpers
is harder.  It is worth noting, of course, that this position on the
removability of kfuncs has, thus far, not faced the test of an irate user
whose application depends on a kfunc that has just been removed.
<p>
In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAADnVQ+6aN5nMwaTjoa9ddnT6rakgwb9oPhtdWSsgyaHP8kZ6Q@mail.gmail.com/">a
later response</a>, Starovoitov questioned the "versatility" of
<tt>panic()</tt>, and said that lower-level functions should be provided to
BPF programs instead.  Thus, there should be one to create a crash dump,
one to send a message to the console, one to halt the system, one to
reboot, and so on.  That way, he said, the program itself can decide what
should happen rather than depending on a specific configuration of the
system.
<p>
There is clearly another revision of this patch set coming in the future,
and it may look significantly different than it did the first time around.
But it also seems clear that there is a use case for this sort of
"destructive" functionality in BPF programs.  The BPF system is quickly
growing beyond packet handling and information gathering and heading toward
a point where arbitrary types of kernel functionality are available to BPF
programs.  It's not clear where all of this leads, but it seems likely to
be interesting.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It&#x27;s all clearly headed towards a microkernel, without the privilege separation and a verifier instead. Except the kernel is unlikely to be micro unless large sections of existing functionality are emulated with BPF programs.<br>
<p>
But, it&#x27;s the same sort of idea: functionality isolated into small chunks with restricted authority and which can be loaded and unloaded at will.<br>

           </div>
The Spectre variant 2 vulnerability allows the speculative execution of
incorrect (in an attacker-controllable way) indirect branch predictions,
resulting in 
the ability to exfiltrate information via side channels.  The kernel has
been reasonably well protected against this variant since shortly after its
disclosure in January.  It is, however, possible for user-space processes
to use Spectre v2 to attack each other; thus far, the mainline kernel has
offered relatively little protection against such attacks.  A recent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809041619510.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">proposal</a>
from Jiri Kosina may change that situation, but there are still some
disagreements around the details.
<p>
On relatively recent processors (or those with suitably patched microcode),
the "indirect branch prediction barrier" (IBPB) operation can be used to
flush the branch-prediction buffer, removing any poisoning that an attacker
might have put there.  Doing an IBPB whenever the kernel switches execution
from one process to another would defeat most Spectre v2 attacks, but IBPB
is seen as being expensive, so this does not happen.  Instead, the kernel
looks to see whether the incoming process has marked itself as being
non-dumpable, which is typically only done by specialized processes that
want to prevent secrets from showing up in core dumps.  In such cases, the
process is deemed to be worth protecting and the IBPB is performed.
<p>
Kosina notes that only a "<q>negligible minority</q>" of the code
running on Linux systems marks itself as non-dumpable, so user space on
Linux systems is essentially unprotected against Spectre&nbsp;v2.  The
solution he proposes is to use IBPB more often.  In particular, the new
code checks whether the outgoing process would be able to call <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>
on the incoming process.  If so, the new process can keep no secrets from
the old one in any case, so there is no point in executing an IBPB
operation.  In cases where <tt>ptrace()</tt> would not succeed, though, the
IBPB will happen.
<p>
This code, Kosina said, has been shipping in SUSE kernels since the initial
disclosure of the Spectre vulnerabilities.
<p>
Comments on this change focused on two specific areas.  One was the fact
that Casey Schaufler has been working on a <a
href="/Articles/763058/">"sidechannel" Linux security module</a> (LSM)
specifically 
intended to make decisions on when operations like IBPB should be
performed.  This module leaves it up to the security policy to decide when
the possibility of an attack exists; different security mechanisms might
make different decisions here.  Kosina's patch, instead, wires the policy
directly into the kernel.  Schaufler <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/99FC4B6EFCEFD44486C35F4C281DC67321447094@ORSMSX107.amr.corp.intel.com/">argued</a>
in this discussion that using <tt>ptrace()</tt> was the wrong approach:
"<q>Even if ptrace_may_access() does exactly what you want it to for
side-channel mitigation today it would be incredibly inappropriate to tie
the two together for eternity.</q>"
<p>

Kosina initially <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809042046180.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">agreed</a>
to drop his patches in favor of the sidechannel module, but later
backtracked for a couple of reasons, including the fact that this module is
not ready for production use yet.  Beyond that, giving the administrator the
flexibility to choose among 
policies has its advantages, but those advantages come at a cost, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809050725390.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I am a bit afraid that we are offloading to sysadmins decisions
	that are very hard for them to make, as they require deep
	understanding of both the technical details of the security issue
	in the CPU, and the mitigation.
</div>
<p>
Instead, he said, the only choice provided should be
whether protection against Spectre&nbsp;v2 is needed or not.
<p>
There are also questions about whether security modules are the right place
to make decisions on the use of mitigations for hardware vulnerabilities.
Andrea Arcangeli <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180905023832.GM4762@redhat.com/">noted</a> that
the other defenses against Meltdown and Spectre are not controlled by
security modules:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Even if you build with CONFIG_SECURITY=n PTI won't go away,
	retpoline won't go away, the l1flush in vmenter won't go away, the
	pte/transhugepmd inversion won't go away, why only the runtime
	tunability or tweaking of IBPB fits in a LSM module?
</div>
<p>
For now, Kosina plans to
continue to push the patch set using the <tt>ptrace()</tt> check for now;
"<q>we can then later see whether the LSM implementation, once it
exists, should be used instead</q>".
<p>
The other question on developers' minds was the performance impact of this
change; Kosina did not include any numbers with the patch set.  Andi Kleen
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180905155823.GL27886@tassilo.jf.intel.com/">complained</a>
about that omission, saying "<q>It's ridiculous to even discuss this
without them</q>".  Arcangeli <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180904233714.GJ4762@redhat.com/">asserted</a> that "<q>IBPB has never been measurable if done only when the prev task
cannot ptrace the next task</q>", but he, too, did not offer numbers to
back that claim up.  It seems certain that some real measurements will be
required before this code can go upstream.  On the other hand, some
developers clearly see the security aspect as being the most important; as
Thomas Gleixner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.21.1809052025250.1416@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/">put
it</a>: "<q>Either we care about that problem and provide a proper mechanism to protect
systems or we do not. That's not a performance number problem at
all</q>". 
<p>
One other aspect of the Spectre problem is, inevitably, hyperthreading.
Sibling CPUs share resources, including the branch-prediction buffer, so it
may be possible for code running on one sibling to attack the process
running on the other.  The "single thread indirect branch predictors"
(STIBP) feature provided on some Intel CPUs
disables this sharing, and can thus block those attacks.  The kernel does
not currently use STIBP, but Kosina's patch set adds it, leaving it enabled
whenever hyperthreading is in use.  Again, no numbers showing the
performance impact of the change were provided.
<p>
Once the dust settles, the kernel is likely to end up with increased
protection against Spectre&nbsp;v2 for user-space processes.  It might seem
unfortunate that this fix is not likely to find its way into a released
kernel until a full year after the disclosure of this vulnerability; Kosina
clearly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809052029160.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">thinks
so</a>.  On
the other hand, it is not clear that there are a lot of attackers out there
trying to use this vulnerability against user-space processes.
Dealing with hardware always involves tradeoffs and workarounds for
difficult behavior; the best ways to handle such behavior can take some
time to work out.  The kernel developers will eventually settle on the best
ways to deal with Spectre&nbsp;v2.  That would be more comforting, of
course, if we had any confidence that the flow of speculative-execution
vulnerabilities will slow down sometime soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

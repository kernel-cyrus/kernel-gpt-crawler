<p>
Matthew Garrett began his <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-security-summit">Linux
Security Summit</a> talk by noting that the "security of the boot chain is
vital" to having secure systems.  It does not matter if the kernel can
protect itself, referring to the <a href="/Articles/698827/">talk</a> just
prior to his; if the boot process can be manipulated, those protections are
immaterial.  So, he wanted to present where things stand with regard to
securing the 
boot chain.
</p>

<p>
In the Linux world, UEFI Secure Boot is the primary boot protection
mechanism; it requires that the bootloader be signed by a key that is
trusted by 
the firmware or the system won't boot. There are also various solutions for
embedded devices that are typically implemented by the system on chip
(SoC).  The trust is rooted in the firmware in either case; if someone can
modify the firmware, all bets are off.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Beyond that, most of the existing mechanisms provide no way to prove that
the verification of the code to be booted has been done.  The running
kernel has no way to know that it is running on a base that has been
integrity checked—or even whether the kernel itself has been tampered
with—any query 
it could make could be answered with a fake "yes".
</p>

<p>
That kind of attack generally requires privileged access to the hardware,
which is a hazard 
in its own right, so why would those kinds of attacks matter, he asked.
One problem area is that there are providers of "bare metal" servers for
users who 
want the convenience of the cloud without its usual performance penalty.
Users of those systems will have root privileges, which will allow them to
access the hardware, including potentially permanently changing the
firmware to something malicious.

<p>
He posited a scenario where an attacker
would take out a large number of short-term leases on hardware at a site
that is known to be used by the victim.  Each system is then infected with
malicious firmware and "returned" to the pool at the hosting company.  Some
of those systems will eventually be picked up by the victim; "Secure Boot
will not help you" in that situation, he said.
</p>

<p>
Another worrisome possibility is for laptops that are surrendered when
passing through borders.  Perhaps it is overly paranoid to be worried about
permanent firmware changes being made at the border, he said, but it is at
least worth thinking about.  While there is not much that can be done to
protect against hardware-based attacks (e.g. adding some malicious hardware to a
laptop or server), most of the other kinds of attacks can be handled.
</p>

<h4>TPM to the rescue</h4>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted
Platform Module</a> (TPM) is a bit of hardware that can help.  When it was
first introduced it got a bad reputation 
because it was "easy to portray it 
as a DRM mechanism", though it is difficult to deploy that way and no one
has actually done so.  TPMs are small chips, made by several different
manufacturers, that are generally differentiated by their performance and
amount of NVRAM storage they provide.  TPM implementations also have "a
bewildering array of different bugs", Garrett said.
</p>

<p>
TPMs have several functions, but the one of interest for ensuring that the
boot process has not been tampered with uses the platform configuration
registers (PCRs).  They are normally 16-24 registers that are not directly
accessible outside of the chip; all access is mediated by the rules of the
TPM.  PCRs are 20 bytes long in TPM&nbsp;1.2, which is the length of an
SHA-1 hash; TPM&nbsp;2.0 allows for multiple hash algorithms, so the number
and size of the PCRs changes to support them. 
</p>

<p>
Ensuring tamper-free boot means that each step of the process must be
"measured", which effectively means calculating a cryptographic hash of the
binary.  Each step in the boot process would measure the next, so the
firmware measures the bootloader, the bootloader measures the kernel and
initial ramdisk (initrd), and so on.  The PCRs provide a tamper-proof
mechanism to 
assist in 
the measurement process.
</p>

<p>
One cannot store a value directly into a PCR; instead the TPM must be asked to
store the value, which it does in a way that provides integrity to the
result.  Instead of just storing the value, which would allow any program
with access to the hardware to set it to the "right" value, it concatenates
the existing value in the PCR and the written value (typically the hash of
the measured data) and hashes the result.  So, in order to reproduce the
value in a given PCR, the same measurements must be written to the register
in the same order.  
</p>

<p>
There is also a log associated with the TPM.  Each measurement adds an
entry to the log that records what was measured and what the hash was.
While untrusted code can overwrite the log, he said, that turns out not to
be as much of a problem as it sounds.
</p>

<p>
All x86 firmware has measurement capabilities, though sometimes there are
problems with what they can measure.  For example, there was firmware he
encountered that would measure code that came from disk, but not code that
came via a network boot, which kind of misses the point.  But that firmware
has since been fixed.
</p>

<h4>Bootloader support</h4>

<p>
There is no Linux bootloader that supports measurement, however.  At one
time, <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedgrub/">TrustedGRUB</a> could
be used, but it is now "old and busted"; it worked, but it "wasn't
particularly nice", Garrett said.  Rohde &amp; Schwarz Cybersecurity have
developed <a
href="https://github.com/Rohde-Schwarz-Cybersecurity/TrustedGRUB2">TrustedGRUB2</a>,
which supports using the TPM,
but it has some shortcomings.  In particular, it does not support UEFI or
TPM&nbsp;2.0. 
So, Garrett and others have added code to GRUB&nbsp;2 to support measuring the
kernel and other components at boot time (in <a
href="https://github.com/coreos/grub">this GitHub repository</a>).
</p>

<p>
There is more to measure than just the kernel, however.  The booted state
of the system is affected by many other components and configuration
files.  The kernel command line is relevant, as is the GRUB configuration,
since GRUB has a scripting interface that can make hardware changes.
</p>

<p>
But putting each individual configuration piece into its own PCR does not
scale because there are a limited number of them.  So there is a need to
reuse PCRs, but the final value of the PCR will depend on the order in
which those items were measured.  Trying to establish a strict ordering is
something he would like to avoid.  There is also the problem that
unimportant changes to configuration files (e.g. comments) will still cause
the final hash value to be different.  For those and other reasons, using
the PCRs that way is suboptimal, he said.
</p>

<p>
Instead, though, the log file can be used.  It can be overwritten with
invalid data, but that can be detected by replaying the log and calculating
the hashes independently.  There are two formatting possibilities for the
log messages 
that Garrett described.  The first would log a description of the binary
and its hash, which is fine for a small number of binaries.  That doesn't
work so well for configuration information, though, because it may have
unimportant changes that alter the hash.  For those, the log entry would
contain the text that has been hashed in conjunction with its hash.
</p>

<p>
Then there needs to be a policy file that describes the acceptable hashes
for binaries as well as the allowable text for configuration (using regular
expressions for parameters and the like).  Creating that policy may
be rather troublesome, though.  His employer, CoreOS, builds the policy
automatically for each release.  The policy is not complete, however, since
it needs known-good hashes for the firmware on the system and no firmware
vendor he knows provides that information.  So CoreOS users must extract
the values from a known-good system, which will work fine unless the
firmware is upgraded at some point.
</p>

<p>
While it is easy for CoreOS to provide an initial RAM filesystem
(initramfs) and its hash, other distributions build the initramfs on the
user's system when the
kernel or other components are updated.  Timestamps then get into the
binary, which means the hash is different for each.  Some kind of generic
initramfs using reproducible build mechanisms would alleviate that problem.
</p>

<p>
There is also a question of where the boot data gets stored.  If it is
stored in the initramfs, that will change the hash, so he suggested using
UEFI variables for some information and the TPM for keys.  In a process
known as "sealing", the TPM can
store encrypted information that it will only decrypt if certain PCRs have
the right values to show that the boot process has not been tampered with.
Having sealed keys for <a
href="https://github.com/mjg59/tpmtotp">tpmtotp</a> 
(Time-based one-time password, TOTP, attestation using the TPM), disk
encryption, or SSH would ensure that the data is only available to properly
booted systems.
</p>

<p>
One problem that has not yet been solved is handling firmware or operating
system upgrades. There needs to be a mechanism to unseal values and reseal
them based on the upgraded system.  So far, no solution to that problem has
been found.
</p>

<p>
Intel's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Execution_Technology">Trusted
Execution Technology</a> (TXT) is supposed to make this all easier, he
said, but that isn't the case.  TXT is based on a dynamic root of trust,
rather than the static root of trust used by TPM, which in theory would
sidestep some of the problems that the TPM-based boot integrity has
encountered.  But TXT has "no meaningful support for Secure Boot" and it is
also incompatible with runtime UEFI.  In effect, Garrett said, TXT is not
compatible with the way we boot operating systems.
</p>

<h4>To do</h4>

<p>
There are still things that need to be done before this gets into the hands
of users.  Support for it needs to ship in bootloaders;  the
firmware in desktop systems is likely to have lots of different bugs that
may cause systems using this feature not to boot, so there is a lot of
testing work to be done there.  Firmware vendors and distributions will
need to start shipping known-good measurements.  The firmware upgrade
process will need to be integrated with updating the measurement
information and there will need to be ways to create initramfs images
deterministically.   But we are getting closer to having measured boot
right out of the box.
</p>

<p>
One audience member wondered about the patches to GRUB&nbsp;2 and whether those
would be making their way upstream.  Garrett said that he plans to do that;
he has talked to Richard Stallman and convinced him that what was being
done was "not intrinsically evil", which was met with audience applause.
Garrett joked that he hoped that would find its way into his annual
performance review.

<p>
GRUB&nbsp;2 has a new maintainer who is more active, he said, which should
help getting this work upstream.  There is one problem, however, in that
the GRUB&nbsp;2 project requires 
copyright assignment and some of the code comes from TrustedGRUB, which he
can't assign.  He is looking to resolve that since he does not want
out-of-tree patches.

While TXT may have issues, the dynamic aspects associated with Intel's opencit project has other values, such as only being able to access secrets if booted from a known path. Having a central server which knows about multiple (trusted) firmware versions, multiple grub configurations, etc, lends itself to working across diverse systems without requiring them to be updated in lockstep. Being able to combine measured boot work with opencit capabilities has value above having just one or the other.<br>

In terms of number of Linux units "securely"  running, I don't know if UEFI secure boot is big enough to be even visible in the "real world".<br>
<a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/</a><br>
<p>
Even less so considering most Linux PC users just disable UEFI secure boot, right? So maybe the number is smaller than even this:<br>

Does anyone know what's *currently* used in the (Linux) clouds if anything?<br>

Um, no...<br>

Both my Fedora laptop and my small home server are running with secure boot enabled. Because, why not? It just works.<br>

Afaik the implementation of secure boot has not been hashed out in the upstream kernel community which means enabling it can bring a world of pain since each distribution that supports it most likely is carrying their own patch set against the kernel to do so.<br>

For all the negativity surrounding Secure Boot, I'd be okay with using it if the bootloader had a UI identical to OpenSSH's: an ASCII art representation of the boot state hash and some in-your-face prompts if it doesn't find a stored/correct value for the kernel being booted.<br>
<p>
The main point here is that I don't trust a bootloader that claims it's secure and indicates so by giving the silent treatment — I want it to show its work.<br>

You have to sign any downloaded binary and it has to be done inside the tpm then hashed and stored or you invite collision attacks.<br>

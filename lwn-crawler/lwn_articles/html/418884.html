The <a href="/Articles/415740/">TTY-based group scheduling</a> patch set
has received a lot of discussion on LWN and elsewhere; some distributors
are rushing out kernels with this code added, despite the fact that it has
not yet been merged into the mainline.  That patch has evolved slightly
since it was last discussed here.  There have also been some interesting
conversations about alternatives; this article will attempt to bring things
up to date.
<p>
The main change to the TTY-based group scheduling patch set is that it is,
in fact, no longer TTY-based.  The identity of the controlling terminal was
chosen as a heuristic which could be used to group together tasks which
should compete with each other for CPU time, but other choices are
possible.  An obvious possibility is the session ID.  This ID is used to
identify distinct process groups; a process starts a new session with the
<tt>setsid()</tt> system call.  Since sessions are already used to group
together related processes, it makes sense to use the session ID as the key
when grouping processes for scheduling.  More recent versions of the patch
do exactly that.  The session-based group scheduling mechanism appears to
be stabilizing; chances are good that it will be merged in the 2.6.38 merge
window.
<p>
Meanwhile, there have been a couple of discussions led by vocal proponents
of other approaches to interactive scheduling.  It is fair to say that
neither is likely to find its way into the mainline.  Both are worth a
look, though, as examples of how people are thinking about the problem.
<p>
Colin Walters <a href="/Articles/418885/">asked</a> about whether group
scheduling could be tied into the "niceness" priorities which have been implemented by Unix
and Linux schedulers for decades.  People are used to <tt>nice</tt>, he
said, but they would like it to work better.  Creating groups for nice
levels would help to make that happen.  But Linus was <a
href="/Articles/418739/">not excited</a> about this idea; he claims that
almost nobody uses <tt>nice</tt> now and that is unlikely to change.
<p>
More to the point, though: the semantics implemented by <tt>nice</tt> are
very different from those offered by group scheduling.  The former is
entirely priority-based, making the promise that processes with a higher
"niceness" will get less processor time than those with lower values.
Group scheduling, instead, is about isolation - keeping groups of processes
from interfering with each other.  The concept of priorities is poorly
handled by group scheduling now, it's just not how that mechanism works.
Group scheduling will not cause one set of processes to run in favor of
another; it just ensures that the division of CPU time between the groups
is fair.
<p>
Colin went on to suggest that using groups would improve <tt>nice</tt>,
giving the results that users really want.  But changing something as
fundamental as the effects of niceness would be, in a very real sense, an
ABI change.  There may not be many users of <tt>nice</tt>, but
installations which depend on it would not appreciate a change in its
semantics.  So <tt>nice</tt> will stay the way it is, and group scheduling
will be used to implement different (presumably better) semantics.
<p>
The group scheduling discussion also featured <a href="/Articles/418887/">a
rare appearance by Con Kolivas</a>.  Con's view is that the session-based
group scheduling patch is another attempt to put interactivity heuristics
into the kernel - an approach which has failed in the past:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You want to program more intelligence in to work around these
	regressions, you'll just get yourself deeper and deeper into the
	same quagmire. The 'quick fix' you seek now is not something you
	should be defending so vehemently. The "I have a solution now" just
	doesn't make sense in this light. I for one do not welcome our new
	heuristic overlords.
</div>
<p>

Con's alternative suggestion was to put control of interactivity more
directly into the hands of user space.  He would attach a parameter to
every process describing its latency needs.  Applications could then be
coded to communicate their needs to the kernel; an audio processing
application would request the lowest latency, while <tt>make</tt> would
inform the kernel that latency matters little.  Con would also add a global
knob controlling whether low-latency processes would also get more CPU
time.  The result, he says, would be to explicitly favor "foreground"
processes (assuming those processes are the ones which request lower
latency).  Distributors could set up defaults for these parameters; users
could change them, if they wanted to.

<p>

All of that, Con said, would be a good way to "<q>move away from the
fragile heuristic tweaks and find a longer term robust solution.</q>"
The suggestion has not been particularly well received, though.  Group
scheduling was defended against the "heuristics" label; it is simply an
implementation of the scheduling preferences established by the user or
system administrator.  The session-based component is just a default for
how the groups can be composed; it may well be a better default than "no
groups," which is what most systems are using now.  More to the point,
changing that default is easily done.  Lennart Poettering's systemd-driven
groups are an example; they are managed entirely from user space.  Group
scheduling is, in fact, quite easy to manage for anybody who wants to set
up a different scheme.
<p>

So we'll probably not see Con's knobs added anytime soon - even if somebody
does actually create a patch to implement them.  What we might see, though,
is a variant on that approach where processes could specify exact latency
and CPU requirements.  A patch for that does exist - it's called the <a
href="/Articles/356576/">deadline scheduler</a>.  If clever group
scheduling turns out not to solve everybody's problem (likely - somebody
always has an intractable problem), we might see a new push to get the
deadline scheduling patches merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Con Kolivas's suggestion makes sense, and is mostly orthogonal to group scheduling.  Clearly, the requirements for 'gcc' or 'tar' are quite different to those for interactive processes.  From gcc's point of view it matters little whether it gets a second of CPU time in a single lump and is then suspended for a whole second.  Throughput is important, latency is not.  Even a simple flag for 'this is a batch process' would work.<br>

      And if you have an exceptionally slow filesystem, also multiply by the expansion factor (single thread total time / CPU time).  One one system I use, with a single CPU, I found -j6 gave minimum elapsed time.

Just because the application asks for something doesn't mean it gets it. Currently, the kernel acts as if applications all want all of the processor time. But some applications actually only want some of the processor time. If an application can only make use of the first 1 us of every 1 ms, and asks to run only then, the kernel may be able to give it 100% of the time it wants without any system impact; if, on the other hand, it can't tell the kernel, it has to busy-wait through a lot more processor time in order to get any change of being running then, and load the system much more heavily.<br>
<p>
The right design is to assume that programs want everything, and let them say what they don't want. Then you don't give them anything they don't want. Then the usual fairness and best effort goals essentially work again: if you have a batch process and a realtime process of the same priority, it is equally bad to miss the realtime process's window once as to not run the batch process at all for 1 ms; that is, the scheduler should try equally hard to avoid either happening, and fail about equally often under random load. Of course, writing a scheduler that does this optimally is hard, but the theory shows that it is possible to give userspace controls such that a program can benefit by decreasing its demands on the system.<br>

      <blockquote>If an application can only make use of the first 1 us of every 1 ms, and asks to run only then, the kernel may be able to give it 100% of the time it wants without any system impact; if, on the other hand, it can't tell the kernel, it has to busy-wait through a lot more processor time in order to get any change of being running then, and load the system much more heavily.</blockquote>

<p>What's wrong with <tt>nanosleep</tt>?

Last time I tried it, if the kernel happened to start running a different process 98 us before your sleep was scheduled to complete, and the other process was getting a 100 us slice, it would wake you 2 us after the start of the millisecond, when your process can't do anything other than record the loss of a sample and go back to sleep for 998 us. nanosleep is fine for telling the kernel you can't do anything until a given time, but it doesn't tell the kernel that, in 999 us, there will be 1 us that you can use, followed by another 999 us during which your either done or too late to do anything.<br>
<p>
The scales in my example are different from what I was actually doing at the time, but I was trying to sample an accelerometer attached to an i2c bus attached to a serial port at 20 Hz; I needed to send a few bytes at the right time, which would cause the accelerometer to take a sample then. (The accelerometer device didn't support automatic periodic sampling.) It turned out that the only way to get data that I could analyze was to sleep until 1 ms before the time I wanted to sample and busy-wait until the right time; that meant I was generally running by the sample time, and generally hadn't used up my time slice. On the other hand, I was burning ~2% of the CPU on a power-limited system busy-waiting.<br>

I'm surprised -- on modern Linux, if you make use of RT scheduling (and especially if you can use the -rt branch) then I think you should be able to get &lt;1 ms wakeup resolution.<br>

This was, admittedly, a while ago, on a vanilla kernel. But I also didn't want to need any special scheduling capabilities. I'd be okay with dropping the occasional sample under heavy load (so it's not really a real-time critical task), but just sleeping was causing me to drop lots of samples under minimal load.<br>

Doesn't work as developers are "lazy".  I think default needs to be some middle ground so that some processes can say they need more and some can say then need less (priority, scheduling accuracy...).  Former group because they've been found to have problems and latter because they've been found to cause problems.  I.e. minimize the number of programs that need to be modified to get system behave properly.<br>

Agreed!<br>

For GUI-heavy users, nothing is bound to a TTY anyway!  There aren't any processes bound to TTYs on my wife's machine for example, other than some lonely gettys and the X server itself.<br>

      <blockquote>
"But changing something as fundamental as the effects of niceness would be, in a very real sense, an ABI change.  There may not be many users of nice, but installations which depend on it would not appreciate a change in its semantics."
</blockquote>

Ironically, changing the traditional semantics of niceness was exactly what the "group scheduling" feature (a.k.a. autogroup) did bring about. When autogrouping is on (which is the default in various distributions), then in many usages (e.g., when applied to one of two CPU bound jobs that is running in two different terminal windows), nice(1) becomes a no-op. See <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/805599/nice-has-no-effect-in-linux-unless-the-same-shell-is-used/1151279#1151279">this note</a> and details on the autogroup feature in the (soon to be released) revised <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sched.7.html">sched(7)</a> manual page. A web search easily finds many <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=linux+nice+value+has+no+effect&hl=en&gws_rd=cr&ei=-PRDWNXCLsm96ASZ_o7IBA">users who got surprised by the change</a>.

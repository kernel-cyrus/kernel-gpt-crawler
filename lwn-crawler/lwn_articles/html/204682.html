<h1>Return values, warnings, and error situations</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 17, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The function <tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt> enables the "memory write and
invalidate" (MWI) mode on the PCI bus.  If the device on the other end can
work with MWI, a small optimization results.  The MWI mode might not be
enabled, however, even if a device driver requests it; the bus hardware
itself might not support it.  A failure to set MWI is not generally a
problem; things just go a bit slower than they would have otherwise.  The
calling driver might still want to know if the call succeeded, however, so
Matthew Wilcox recently <a href="/Articles/204683/">fixed the function</a>
to return <tt>-EINVAL</tt> if the attempt fails.
<p>

It turns out that this is one of the many patches which have recently
sabotaged Andrew Morton's heavily abused Vaio laptop.  Some code was
checking the result of <tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt>; once that function actually
returned the result of the operation, the calling code failed on an error
path.  But, as noted above, a failure to set MWI is almost never a fatal
problem.  So, in response to this series of events, Alan Cox <a
href="/Articles/204686/">asserted</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The underlying bug is that someone marked pci_set_mwi must-check,
	that's wrong for most of the drivers that use it. If you remove the
	must check annotation from it then the problem and a thousand other
	spurious warnings go away.
</div>
<p>
One suspects Alan is also behind code like the following, from
<tt>drivers/ata/pata_cs5530.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    compiler_warning_pointless_fix = pci_set_mwi(cs5530_0);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>__must_check</tt> annotation makes use of the gcc
<tt>warn_unused_result</tt> attribute; it first found its way into the
mainline in 2.6.8.  If a function is marked <tt>__must_check</tt>, the
compiler will issue a strong warning whenever the function is called and
its return code is unused.
<p>
The use of <tt>__must_check</tt> is another step in the long path toward
automatic detection of potential bugs.  It is intended for functions whose
return value really does require checking - <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> is a
good example.  If that function fails, and the calling code does not
notice, it will proceed using essentially random data.  Similar issues come
up in user space; witness the recent vulnerabilities resulting from
privileged applications which fail to check the result of a
<tt>setuid()</tt> call.  In some cases, there clearly is no excuse for not
looking at the return value, and <tt>__must_check</tt> is a good way to
find incorrect function usage before it creates real problems.
<p>

In current kernels, however, the list of <tt>__must_check</tt> functions
has grown rather long: it includes most of the sysfs, PCI, kobject, and
driver core APIs.  In some cases, as with <tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt>, it now
includes functions whose return values are often of no interest to the
calling code.  The result, in this case, is snide workarounds in the code,
added warning noise, and an actual bug where code which need not fail does
so in response to an error return code.
<p>

Still, <a href="/Articles/204689/">according to Andrew Morton</a>, it is a
mistake to ignore an error return from a function like
<tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt>: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You, the driver author _do not know_ what pci_set_mwi() does at
	present, on all platforms, nor do you know what it does in the
	future.  For you the driver author to make assumptions about what's
	happening inside pci_set_mwi() is a layering violation.  Maybe the
	bridge got hot-unplugged.  Maybe the attempt to set MWI caused some
	synchronous PCI error.  For example, take a look at the various
	implementations of pci_ops.read() around the place - various of
	them can fail for various reasons.
</div>
<p>
This discussion led, eventually, to what might be the real issue: how
should in-kernel APIs be designed to properly return status information?  A
suggestion which has been made is that <tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt> should return
zero or one, depending on whether MWI is a possible operating mode.  Only
if something goes drastically wrong on the PCI bus should a negative error
code be returned.  No such patch has yet been merged, but that seems like
the way this particular issue is likely to be resolved.
<p>

The larger discussion of how errors should be handled may just be beginning,
however.  There are a number of de-facto conventions for kernel APIs which
have evolved over time, but no overall policy on error handling.  So Andrew
<a href="/Articles/204691/">would like to talk</a> about guidelines on how
different kinds of errors should be handled.  In particular, he suggests a
rule that a negative error code should never be ignored in any situation.
Cases where this kind of result is not relevant (<tt>pci_set_mwi()</tt>
being an example) are an indication of an API in need of a redesign.
<p>

So over time, it would not be surprising to see a number of kernel
interfaces shift such that a number of error conditions are handled further
down the call chain and with the goal of not returning error codes for
non-error situations.  There is also likely to be a continued effort to cut
down on the warning noise, which, at times, threatens to drown out the real
errors.  With luck, all of this work will lead to safer interfaces and a more
robust kernel in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Although not relating to function return values, I have seen pci_set_mwi() make a 10x difference in performance for a 3ware RAID controller on certain motherboards - hardly "a small optimization".  On most devices it doesn't make much of a difference though.<br>

      Andrew later found that this patch didn't actually cause his laptop to fail after all.  Or maybe it had earlier, but didn't any more.  Very strange, whatever was going on.<br>
<p>
One of the other PCI patches I posted seems to have broken everybody's suspend.  I really should dust off my wife's old Vaio and try to get suspend/resume going on that.<br>

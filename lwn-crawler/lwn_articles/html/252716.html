<h1>What's in the realtime tree</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 3, 2007</br>
           </div>
It has been almost exactly three years since Sven-Thorsten Dietrich posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/105866/">a set of realtime improvements</a>
to the linux-kernel list.  That particular body of code was upstaged by the
realtime preemption work done by Ingo Molnar and others, but it deserves
some credit for kicking off a development effort which continues to this
day.  After three years, many parts of the realtime preemption patch set
have been merged into the mainline kernel, including dynamic tick support,
a rewritten interrupt subsystem, mutexes, priority inheritance,
high-resolution timers, and more.  At this point, we are all running
kernels which have benefited from the realtime preemption project.
<p>

The job of merging the realtime preemption work into the mainline is not
complete, though.  Indeed, a look at the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/251889/">2.6.23-rc8-rt1</a> tree announcement
shows that there are nearly 400 individual patches sitting there.  This
seems like a good opportunity to have a look at the realtime tree and see
what remains to be merged.
<p>

The core of this patch set remains the realtime mutex code.  When the
kernel is configured for realtime operation, a bunch of (improved, but
still scary) preprocessor magic causes normal spinlocks to be replaced by
realtime mutexes, which have different properties.  In particular, realtime
mutexes are fully preemptible and have priority inheritance.  With most
kernel spinlocks replaced by these mutexes, there are few places in the
kernel which are able to cause arbitrary latencies.
<p>

Merging realtime mutexes should, in theory, not be a problem; they are not
actually used unless explicitly configured into the kernel, and it is
assumed that most users will not configure things that way.  Such a
fundamental change to a core mutual exclusion mechanism will always raise
eyebrows, though.  So there have been no attempts to merge this code so
far, and it is likely that most of the other parts of the realtime tree
will find their way into the mainline first.

<p>

Code which could go in sooner is the threaded interrupt handlers patch.
Putting interrupt handlers into threads allows them to be scheduled along
with most other system activities and eliminates another potential source
of latency.  It also can improve the robustness of the system and make it
easier to find bugs in interrupt code.  So this patch could be merged and
possibly even made the default - though there will always be a small number
of interrupt handlers which must be run directly.  
<p>

Also in the realtime tree is a patch which moves all software interrupt
processing into dedicated threads.  Then there is a patch which allows
hardware interrupt handling threads to process any pending software interrupts
before yielding the processor.  This optimization avoids the need for a
context switch to a separate software IRQ thread to get those interrupts
delivered.

<p>

One of the sticking points with the realtime patches has been their
interaction with the read-copy-update mechanism.  The current code requires
that preemption be disabled while references to RCU-protected data
structures exist, but disabling preemption ruins the guarantees that the
realtime code is trying to provide.  The answer is a somewhat more
complicated, preemptible RCU implementation.  With luck, LWN will have an
article on how preemptible RCU works in the near future.
<p>
Nick Piggin's lockless pagecache patches have found their way into the
realtime tree.  These patches make a number of low-level changes to the
memory management and radix tree code so that some pagecache operations can
be done without taking any locks.  This code has been in circulation for
some time without making it into the mainline, but it seems like a win in a
number of scalability situations.  Another patch (by Peter Zijlstra) gets
rid of the locking in the <tt>kmap()</tt> code, improving latencies in
systems using high memory.
<p>

<span class="PullQuote">
The wisdom of allowing Java programs to mess with physical memory
is not a topic which should need further discussion here.
</span>
Another patch which has been out of the mainline for quite some time - and
likely to remain that way - is Ted Ts'o's <tt>/dev/rmem</tt> facility.
This device allows direct access to physical memory - a feature which is
required on any system which wants to pass the realtime Java conformance
tests.  The wisdom of allowing Java programs to mess with physical memory
is not a topic which should need further discussion here.
<p>

The realtime tree contains an extensive set of tools for tracking down
parts of the kernel which cause excessive latencies.  This code has, over
the years, been put to good use in identifying and breaking up kernel code
which hogs the processor unnecessarily.  These patches would seem like a
good match for the mainline, especially given recent discussions on the
value of adding more instrumentation to the kernel.  The first step in
solving problems is being able to measure them.
<p>

For reasons which are unclear to your editor, the realtime tree contains
the venerable <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/118785/">realtime security
module</a>, which was definitively refused entry into the mainline a few
years ago.  The module is marked as being obsolete - but it is still there.
<p>

Quite a few other changes can be found in this tree.  The SLUB allocator is
not an option for realtime kernels.  Instead, this tree uses a modified
version of the slab allocator which replaces interrupt-based single-CPU
locking with a set of specific per-CPU locks.  The global
<tt>files_lock</tt> has been removed in favor of tightly-locked per-CPU
lists.  To help with the creation of such lists, a new locked-list type has
been added.  The tasklet code has been reworked for better threading, but
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/239633/">tasklet elimination patch</a>
is not present.  There's also quite a few architecture-specific patches
adding various features (such as clockevents) needed by the realtime tree
and fixing problems.
<p>

All told, there is a lot of code sitting in the realtime tree despite all
of the mainline merging which has happened over the last couple of years or
so.  The stated plan is to merge most of this code in the not-too-distant
future, but it is not clear when that will happen.  In particular, some of
the core realtime developers are likely to be severely distracted by the
i386/x86_64 merger during the 2.6.24 cycle, so they may not manage to move
much of the realtime code toward the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
An addition to the list of credits: the -rt tree also contains Peter Zijlstra's "concurrent pagecache" patches. Nick's patches give us a concurrent "read side" pagecache, Peter's patches (which are similar in size and complexity) make the pagecache completely parallel to all concurrent users, by covering the "write side" too. [ and Peter's pagecache patchset is just az crazy as Nick's ;-) ]

I seriously doubt that. kernel server people may be afraid of rt-ification but some classes of users (the multimedia desktop crowd) want it badly. If it's merged it will be enabled by many people.<br>

Finding places where the kernel accesses memory that it shouldn't is the
goal for the kernel address sanitizer (KASan).  It uses a combination
of a new GCC feature to instrument memory accesses and "shadow memory" to
track which addresses are 
legitimate, so that it
can complain loudly when the kernel reads or writes anywhere 
else.  While KASan shares some attributes with other kernel debugging
features, it has its own advantagesâ€”and has already been used to
find real kernel bugs.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/611410/">KASan patch set</a> comes from Andrey
Ryabinin, though it is based on work by Andrey Konovalov and by the <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/">AddressSanitizer
project</a>.  While the patches are still at the RFC stage, this is the
second version of them.  Many improvements have been made since the <a
href="/Articles/604817/">original RFC</a> was posted back in July.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea behind KASan is to allocate a map (aka "shadow region") that
represents each eight 
bytes of kernel address space with one byte in the map.  For x86_64 (which
is the only architecture supported), that means setting aside (but not
allocating) 16TB of 
address space to handle
the entire 128TB that the kernel can address.  Each byte in the map encodes
the legality of a kernel access to the corresponding bytes in the full
address space.
</p>

<p>
The encoding is fairly straightforward.  A 0 means that all eight
bytes are legal for access, while 1&ndash;7 indicate the number of
consecutive bytes at the beginning of the eight-byte region that are valid
(so 2 means 
that the first two bytes are valid, the last six are not).  Negative values
are for different types of non-accessible memory (free memory, redzones of
various sorts, etc.).  It would seem that other positive values could be
used to encode consecutive valid bytes at the end of the eight-byte region,
but perhaps that does not occur in practice.
</p>

<p>
Kernel memory accesses can then be checked against the shadow map to see if
they are valid. 
GCC 5.0 (the next major release after 4.9, which is expected in 2015) will introduce a new feature that
allows runtime checking of 
kernel addresses. 
The <tt>-fsanitize=kernel-address</tt> flag will cause GCC to instrument
each memory load and store operation.  It will insert a 
function call into each of those operations
that can examine the target address and complain into the kernel log if it
is invalid.   
The
calls are of the form <tt>__asan_loadN()</tt> and <tt>__asan_storeN()</tt>,
where <tt>N</tt> corresponds to the width of the access (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16
bytes).   There are GCC patches available to turn these out-of-line checks
into inline checks, where GCC will directly insert the code to check the
shadow map, rather than
making function calls to do so. 
</p>

<p>
So, the bulk of the work is done by the code inserted by the compiler.
But there are still some details to be handled by the patches.
Implementing the checking and reporting infrastructure is <a
href="/Articles/612266/">step one</a> (that patch also includes a
<tt>Documentation/kasan.txt</tt> file).  Then,
the initial shadow region needs to be populated.  Early in the boot
process, each page table entry in the shadow region is set to the zero
page.  Later, when the 
physical memory has been mapped, the zero pages corresponding to that
memory are unmapped, and real pages are allocated and mapped for tracking
the kernel's memory.

<p>
As pages are allocated by the kernel, they are marked as accessible in the
shadow region; 
likewise, as pages are freed, they are marked inaccessible.
The SLUB allocator has been modified to update the shadow map for its
allocations and deallocations.  
</p>

<p>
In the patch set's first message, Ryabinin outlined the differences between
KASan and a few other kernel memory-debugging tools.  Since KASan uses
compile-time instrumentation, it is much faster than <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kmemcheck.txt">kmemcheck</a>,
but it cannot detect reads of uninitialized memory as kmemcheck does.
While both <tt>DEBUG_PAGEALLOC</tt> and <tt>SLUB_DEBUG</tt> are faster than
KASan, neither can detect all of the illegal accesses that KASan does
(<tt>DEBUG_PAGEALLOC</tt> only has page-level granularity and
<tt>SLUB_DEBUG</tt> is unable to detect some bad reads).
</p>

<p>
KASan is enabled for the kernel with the <tt>KASAN</tt> Kconfig parameter.
It requires the SLUB allocator and a GCC version &gt;= 5.0.  Better
reports will be generated if stack traces and <tt>SLUB_DEBUG</tt> are
enabled. Ryabinin has also added a <a href="/Articles/612265/">test
module</a> that can be used to cause out-of-bounds accesses and
use-after-free errors for testing KASan or other memory debuggers.
</p>

<p>
The discussion on the patches has been constructive, with just a few suggestions
for relatively minor changes. In addition, Sasha Levin <a
href="/Articles/612247/">listed several kernel bugs</a> that he had found
using the <a href="/Articles/536173/">Trinity fuzzer</a> with the first
version of the KASan patch set.  It would seem that there is an 
unfilled niche in the kernel's memory debugging that KASan could help fill.

We definitely need more memory error pinpointing and fixing in the kernel. The lightweight PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE can still find (as a side effect) UAF errors relatively easily, spender mentioned two of them this month: <a href="https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/512219180633182208">https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/512219180633182208</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/506447909110685696">https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/506447909110685696</a> .<br>
AddressSanitizer is much more powerful, but obviously more heavyweight... I hope the lower performance won't turn off too many developers.<br>

Sometimes, a kernel-patch series comes with an exciting, sexy title.  Other
times, the mailing lists are full of patches with titles like "<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220208100750.1189808-1-nsaenzju@redhat.com/">remote
per-cpu lists drain support</a>".  For many, the patches associated with
that title will be just as dry as the title itself.  But, for those who are
interested in such things — a group that includes many LWN readers —
this short patch series from Nicolas Saenz Julienne gives some
insight into just what is required to make the kernel's page allocator as
fast — and as robust — as developers can make it.

<p>
<h4>Per-CPU page lists</h4>
<p>
As its name would suggest, the page allocator is charged with managing the
system's memory in units of whole pages; that distinguishes it from the
slab allocators, which usually deal in smaller chunks of memory.
Allocation and freeing of memory happens frequently within the kernel,
making the page allocator a part of many hot paths.  A single system call
or device interrupt can result in numerous calls into the page allocator,
for example, so that code needs to be fast.  At times, memory management
has been 
identified as the bottleneck limiting the performance of other parts of the
kernel, despite the efforts that have gone into optimizing it.
<p>
At a high level, the page allocator is based on a "buddy allocator", which
deals with memory in power-of-two-sized blocks of pages.  Among other
things, the buddy allocator is good at coalescing adjacent pages into
larger blocks when possible.  This abstraction begins to be problematic,
though, when faced with the needs of contemporary systems, where even a
phone handset can have numerous CPUs in it.  Maintaining a global buddy
structure means a lot of concurrent access to its data; that, in
turn, implies locking and cache misses, both of which can wreck performance.
<p>
One of the best ways to mitigate performance problems resulting from
concurrent access to shared data is to stop performing concurrent access to
shared data.  To the extent that each CPU can work within its own private
sandbox, without contending with other CPUs, performance will be improved.
The page allocator, like many parts of the kernel, uses this approach by
keeping per-CPU lists of free pages.
<p>
Specifically, the memory-management subsystem keeps a per-CPU list of free
pages in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.16.8/source/include/linux/mmzone.h#L498"><tt>zone</tt>
structure</a> used to describe a memory-management zone.  While the reality
is (of course) a little more complicated, this structure can indeed be
thought of as a simple array of lists of pages, one list for each CPU in the
system.  Whenever a given CPU needs to allocate a page, it looks first in
its per-CPU list and grabs a page from there if one is available.  When
that CPU frees a page, it puts it back into the per-CPU list.  In this way,
many page-allocator requests can be satisfied without write access to any
global data structures at all, speeding things considerably.  Rapid reuse
of pages that are cache-hot on the local CPU also helps.
<p>
That only works, of course, if the per-CPU lists have a reasonable number
of pages in them.  If a CPU needs a page and finds its per-CPU list empty,
it will have to take the slower path to obtain memory from the global free
list, possibly contending with other CPUs in the process. 
If, instead, the per-CPU list grows too long, it could tie up memory that
is needed 
elsewhere and some of those pages will need to be given back to the global
allocator.  Much of the time, though, each CPU can work with its own lists
and everybody is happy.
<p>
There is another situation that arises, though, when the system as a whole
comes under memory pressure.  If the memory-management subsystem reaches a
point where it is scrounging for pages anywhere it can find them, it will
soon turn an eye to the per-CPU lists, which may contain memory that is
sitting idle and ripe for the taking.  Unfortunately, even ripe memory
cannot just be taken haphazardly; the per-CPU lists only work as long as
each CPU has exclusive access to its own lists.  If some other CPU pokes
its fingers in, the whole system could go up in flames.
<p>
So what is to be done when the system needs to pillage the per-CPU lists
for free pages?  What happens now is that the kernel asks each CPU to free
("drain") pages out of its own per-CPU lists; this is done with a special,
per-CPU workqueue, which is used to queue a callback to free the pages.
The workqueue entry will run as soon as each target CPU gets around to
scheduling it, which should normally happen fairly quickly.
<p>
This solution is not perfect, though.  At best, it causes context switches
on each target CPU to run the list-draining callback.  But if a target CPU
is running in the tickless mode, or if it is running a high-priority
realtime task, then the workqueue entry may not run at all for a long time.
So any free pages on that CPU will remain locked up in its local lists and,
as luck would have it, that's probably where most of the free pages have
ended up.
<p>
<h4>Draining the lists remotely</h4>
<p>
The patch set is designed to mitigate this problem by making it
possible to remotely (i.e. from a different CPU) take pages from a CPU's
local lists.  A <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211103170512.2745765-1-nsaenzju@redhat.com/">previous
attempt</a> added spinlocks to control access to the per-CPU lists,
essentially taking away much of their per-CPUness; this solution worked, but it
added just the sort of overhead that the per-CPU lists were created to
avoid.  So those patches did not make it into the kernel.
<p>
The current series, instead, falls back on one of the kernel community's
favorite tools for dealing with scalability problems: read-copy-update
(RCU).  That, in turn, requires the original trick of computer science:
adding a layer of indirection.  With this patch series, each CPU now has
<i>two</i> sets of lists to hold free pages, one of which is in use at
any given time, while the other is kept in reserve (and is empty).  A new
pointer added to the <tt>zone</tt> structure points
to the set of lists that is currently in use; whenever a CPU needs to
access its local lists, it must follow that pointer to get to them.
<p>
When the time comes to raid a CPU's lists, the raiding CPU will use an
atomic compare-and-swap operation to switch the target CPU's pointer to the
second (empty) set of lists.  The target CPU might still be working with
the previous set of lists, though, even after the switch is done, so the
raiding CPU must wait for an RCU grace period to pass before actually
accessing the old lists.  Since this is a per-CPU data structure, the
target CPU cannot still hold a reference to the old list once the grace
period has passed; at that point, the old lists are fair game and can be
emptied out.  The target CPU, meanwhile, continues merrily along, though
without its local stash of free pages, without
ever having been interrupted.
<p>
This approach is not entirely free of performance costs either; adding an
extra pointer dereference into the memory-allocation hot paths will add
some overhead.  Various benchmark results show little difference in most
cases, and 
a 1-3% performance loss in some; the cover letter describes this cost as
being acceptable.
<p>
Whether other memory-management developers will agree with that assessment
remains to be seen.  Kernel developers will work long and hard for a 1%
performance increase; they may not be happy to give up that much
performance for the benefit of a subset of use cases.  In the end, though,
the problem being solved is real, and it is not clear that a better
solution is on offer.  Exciting or not, remote per-CPU list draining may be
a feature of future kernels.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Given the number of page allocators :-) could this not just be made a compile-time option? For those willing to pay the hit, it&#x27;s enabled.<br>
<p>
For your typical lightly used desktop, it&#x27;s probably not worth it (but probably wouldn&#x27;t be noticed). For a heavily used server, it&#x27;s a trade-off. For something that runs batches, I dunno ... <br>
<p>
I think the problem is it&#x27;s a big problem for some workloads (I guess when it strikes, it effectively converts your big iron into a uni-processor machine), but for most workloads there&#x27;s no benefit (and for a lot of those workloads you might well not notice the cost, but some you will ...)<br>

I think it is interesting that waiting for synchronize_rcu() is *faster* than waiting for a thread to be run on the other CPU.<br>
<p>
As I understand it (and this is RCU, so that&#x27;s probably &quot;not very well&quot; - Paul: help me here) synchronize_rcu() need to wait for *something* to happen on each other CPU.  That *something* isn&#x27;t a full context switch, but it must be something that can happen on a tick-less CPU??<br>
<p>
synchronize_rcu needs to wait for *all* CPUs, to each do something that is (presumably) light-weight.<br>
Waiting of a thread to run only needs to wait for just that one, but it is (presumably) more heavy-weight.<br>
<p>
Can we combine these? Wait for just one CPU to do the lightweight thing?<br>
Can we hook into whatever synchronize_rcu() waits for, and get it to optionally do some list_move_init() in the per-cpu data structure.  So we set a pointer to say &quot;steal this page list for me&quot;, then wait for the RCU thing to run on that CPU, then start working on that  stolen list of pages.<br>
<p>
The extra pointer load now only happens at grace-interval time, rather than on every alloc/free call, so it should be a lot cheaper.<br>

I think the key point here is &quot;tickless mode&quot; or &quot;very high priority real time tasks&quot; that change the situation considerably. That is, a context switch away from the currently running task might take *very* long or even indefinitely. If that happens, one CPU might slowly hog all of the free pages to its own free list.<br>
<p>
If I understood it correctly, this isn&#x27;t some use case a lot of people are hitting often. But for some people that can hit it, right conditions for it might happen unexpectedly and then you&#x27;re suddenly out of memory even though you shouldn&#x27;t be. Or it could be that during certain use cases you are hitting this all the time, where your system might be unusable unless you are able to drain out the free pages off a busy CPU.<br>

Interesting idea, some comments:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; synchronize_rcu() need to wait for *something* to happen on each other CPU.</font><br>
<p>
That&#x27;s not always true, idle and nohz_full CPUs enter into an &#x27;extended quiescent state&#x27;. These CPUs are not taken into account while tracking grace periods (what syncronize_rcu() synchronizes against). So there is nothing to hook into.<br>

Interesting. About ten years ago we were dealing with a similar issue with a program where memory was often freed in a different thread than it was allocated. At the time at least, this caused issues with the GLibC allocator, where it would occasionally stall because the free() in one thread interacted with the malloc() in the thread that did all the allocations.<br>
<p>

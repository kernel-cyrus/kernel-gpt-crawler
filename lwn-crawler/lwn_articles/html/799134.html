<a href="/Articles/799060">Maintainers Summit</a>
</div>
The first session at the 2019 Linux Kernel Maintainers Summit was a
last-minute addition to the schedule.  Dmitry Vyukov's Linux Plumbers
Conference session on the kernel development process (<a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/554/attachments/353/584/Reflections__Kernel_Summit_2019.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>) had inspired a number of discussions that, it was agreed, should
carry over into the summit.  The result was a wide-ranging conversation
about the kernel's development tools and what could be done to improve
them.
<p>
Ted Ts'o introduced the topic by noting that his employer, Google, has a
group dedicated 
to the creation of development tools, and that a lot of good things have
come from that.  The kernel community also has a lot of tools aimed at
making developers more productive, but rather than having a single group
creating those tools, we have many competing groups.  While competition is
good, he said, it also diffuses the available development time and may not
be, in the end, the best way to go.  He then turned the session over to
Vyukov.
<p>
<h4>Lots of bugs</h4>
<p>
The kernel community has a lot of bugs, he began; various subsystems are
often broken for several releases in a row.  The community adds new
vulnerabilities to the stable releases far too often.  The 4.9 kernel, to
take one example, has had many thousands of fixes backported to it.  There
are a lot of kernel forks out there, each of which replicates each bug, so
keeping up with these fixes adds up 
to a great deal of work for the industry as a whole.  The security of our

<a href="/Articles/799137/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/DmitryVyukov-sm.jpg" alt="[Dmitry Vyukov]"
title="Dmitry Vyukov" class="rthumb"></a>

kernels is "not perfect"; as we fix five holes, ten more are introduced —
on the order of 20,000 bugs per release.  We need to reduce the inflow of
bugs into the kernel, he said, in order to get on top of this problem.
<p>
These bugs hurt developer productivity and reduce satisfaction all around.
Many of them can be attributed to the tools and the processes we use.  We
have many of the necessary pieces to do better, but there is also a lot of
fragmentation.  Every kernel subsystem does things differently; there is a
distinct lack of identity for the kernel as a whole.
<p>
More testing is good, but
testing is hard, he said; it's not just a matter of running a directory
full of tests.  There are a lot of issues that come up.  People run
subsystem-specific tests, but often fail to detect the failures that
happen.  Many groups only do build testing.  About 15 engineer-years of
effort are needed to get to a functional testing setup; the kernel
community is spending more than that, but that effort is not being directed
effectively.  There are at least seven major testing systems out there
(he listed 0day, kernelci.org, CKI, LKFT, ktest, syzbot, and kerneltests)
when we should just have one good system.
<p>
When the testing systems work, a single problem can result in seven bug
reports, each of which must be understood and answered separately.  So
developers have to learn how to interact with each testing system.
Christoph Hellwig interjected that he has never gotten a duplicate bug
report from an automated testing system, but others have had different
experiences.  And, to the extent that duplicate reports do not happen, it
indicates that the testing systems are not functional — they are not
detecting the problems.
<p>
Laura Abbott pointed out that many of the testing systems are not doing the
same thing; their coverage is different, but they still have to reimplement
much of the same infrastructure.  Thomas Gleixner replied that the problem
is at the other end: there is no centralized view of the testing that is
happening.  There are far more than seven systems, he said; many companies
have their own internal testing operations.  There is no way to figure out
whether the same problem has been observed by multiple systems.  Some years
ago, the kerneloops site provided a clear view of where the problem
hotspots were; now a developer might get a random email and can't correlate
reports even when they refer to the same problem.
<p>
Ts'o said that these systems will have to learn to talk to each other,
which will require a lot of engineering work.  But beyond that, even the
systems we have now appear to be overwhelmed.  Once upon a time, the 0day
robot was effective, testing patches and sending results within hours.  Now
he will get a report five days later for a bug in a patch that has already
been superseded by two new versions.  Since there is no unique ID attached
to patches, there is no way for the testing system to recognize updated
versions.  Gerrit has solved this problem, but "everybody hates it", and
there is <a href="/Articles/797613/">little acceptance of change IDs</a> for
patches.  It all works 
nicely within Google, he said, but it requires a lot of internal
infrastructure.  He wondered whether the kernel community could ever have
the same thing.
<p>
Dave Miller said that many companies and individuals are replicating this
kind of testing infrastructure; that is the source of the scalability
problem.  Now, he said, he has to merge patches in batches before doing a
test build; if something is bad, he will lose a bunch of time unwinding
that work.  He would much rather get pull requests with build reports
attached so
that he can act on them without running into trivial problems.  The 0day
robot used to help in that regard, but it has lost its effectiveness.
Abbott wondered if all this effort could be centralized somewhere; given
that the kernelci.org effort is <a href="/Articles/772525/">moving into the
Linux Foundation</a>, perhaps efforts could be focused there.
<p>
<h4>Buy-in needed</h4>
<p>
Vyukov continued by agreeing that, when a maintainer receives a change for
merging, they should know that it has passed the tests.  Applying should be
a simple matter of saying that it is ready to go in during the next merge
window.  But when individual subsystems try to improve their processes by
switching to 
centralized hosting sites, they just make things worse for the community as
a whole by increasing fragmentation.  He doesn't know how to fix all of
this, but he does know that it has to be an explicit effort with buy-in
across the community.  There should be some sort of working group, he said;
the <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20190912120602.GC29277@pure.paranoia.local/">proposal</a>
from Konstantin Ryabitsev could be a good foundation to build on.
<p>
Alexei Starovoitov was quick to say that no sort of community-wide buy-in
to a new system is going to happen; people have too many strong opinions
for that.  But, if there is a better tool out there, he will try it.  The
discussion so far has been all "doom and gloom" he said, but the truth is
that the kernel has been getting better and development is getting easier;
we are rolling out kernels quickly and each is better than the one that
came before.  It quickly became clear that this view was not universally
shared across the room.  Steve Rostedt did acknowledge, though, that the
-rc1 releases have become more stable than they once were; he credited
Vyukov's <a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md">syzbot</a>
work for helping in that regard. 
<p>
Dave Airlie pointed out that, after all these years, we still don't have
universal adoption of basic tools like Git.  Linus Torvalds said that email
is still a wonderful tool for stuff that is in development and in need of
discussion; work at that stage can't really be put into Git.  Miller agreed
that email is "fantastic" for early-stage code, but pointed out that the
usability of email as a whole is no longer under our control.
<p>
<h4>Starting with patchwork</h4>
<p>
Torvalds said that the discussion made it sound like the sky is falling.
Our current automated testing infrastructure generates a lot of "crap", but
1% of it is "gold".  He encouraged the room to concentrate on
concrete solutions to the problems; he liked Ryabitsev's suggestion, which
starts by improving the <a
href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">patchwork</a>  system.
That, he said, should be
something that everybody can agree on.  Airlie said that the
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop.org</a> community
has done this, though, with fully funded 
improvements to patchwork, but it is still "an unmanageable mess" that
loses patches and has a number of other problems.  Miller said that he was
one of the first users of patchwork in the beginning.  Back then, the
patchwork developer was enthusiastic about improving the system to make
developers' lives better.  But the situation has long since changed, and it
is hard to get patchwork improvements now.
<p>
Torvalds said that, if patchwork were to get smarter, more people might use
it.  There are ways that developers could help it work better.  His life
got easier, he said, when Andrew Morton started telling him the base for
the patches he was sending for merging; the same could be done for
patchwork.  But patchwork is focused on email, and Miller argued that
"email's days are numbered".  A full 90% of linux-kernel subscribers are
using Gmail, he said, and Google is turning email into a social network
with a web site.  That gives Google a lot of control over what the
community can do.
<p>
Ts'o said that, rather than focusing on a specific tool, it would be better
to talk about what works.  Gerrit tracks the base of patches now and can
easily show the latest version of any given patch series.  Patchwork
requires a lot more manual work, with result that he has thousands of
messages there that he is unlikely to ever get to.  Olof Johansson pointed
out that Gerrit only understands individual patches and cannot track a
series, which is a problem for the kernel community.  Peter Zijlstra,
said that, instead, its biggest problem is that it is web-based.  Miller
replied that he wants new developers to have a web form they can use to
write commit messages; he spends a lot of time now correcting email
formatting.  Gleixner said that the content of the messages is the real
problem, but Miller insisted that developers, especially drive-by
contributors, do have trouble with the mechanics.
<p>
<h4>Git as the transport layer</h4>
<p>
If patchwork could put multiple versions of a patch series into a Git
repository, Ts'o said, it would enable a lot of interesting functionality,
such as showing the differences between versions.  That is something Gerrit
can do now, and it makes life easier.  Torvalds said that about half of
kernel maintainers are using patchwork; there is no need to enforce its use,
but it is a good starting point for future work that people can live with.
But, he repeated, there needs to be a concrete goal rather than the vague
complaining about the process that has been going on for years.
Ryabitsev's proposal might be a good starting point, he said.
<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman agreed that
patchwork would be a good foundation to build on.  But it's not the whole
solution.  For continuous integration, he said, the focus should be on
kernelci.org; it's the only system out there that is not closed.  Johansson,
though, said that he does not want to have to go into both patchwork and
kernelci.org to see whether something works or not.
<p>
One problem with systems like patchwork is the inability to work with them
offline.  Miller said that, if patchwork stored its data in a Git
repository, developers could pull the latest version before getting onto a
plane and everybody would be happy.  Hellwig said that he has never
understood why people like patchwork.  It would be better, he continued, to
agree on a data format rather than a specific tool.
<p>
Ryabitsev worried that
centralized tools would make "a tasty target" for attackers and should
perhaps be avoided.
He also said that, with regard to data formats, the <a
href="/Articles/748184/">public-inbox</a>
system used to implement <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/">lore.kernel.org</a> can 
provide a mailing-list archive as a Git repository.  Torvalds said that
lore.kernel.org works so well for him that he is considering unsubscribing
from linux-kernel entirely.  Ts'o said that a number of interesting
possibilities open up if Git is used as the transport layer for some future
tool.  Among other things, Ryabitsev has already done a lot of work at
kernel.org to provide control over who can push to a specific repository.
Ryabitsev remains leery of creating a centralized site for kernel
development, though.
<p>
As the discussion wound down, Abbott suggested that what is needed is a
kernel DevOps team populated with developers who are good at creating that
sort of infrastructure.  Hellwig put in a good word for the Debian
bug-tracking system, which allows most things to be done using email.  Ts'o
summarized the requirements he had heard so far: tools must be compatible
with email-based patch review and must work offline.  If the requirements
can be set down, he said, perhaps developers will come along to implement
them, and perhaps funding can be found as well.
<p>
The session closed with the creation of a new "workflows" mailing list on
<a href="https://vger.kernel.org/">vger.kernel.org</a> where developers can
discuss how they work and share their 
scripts.  That seems likely to be the place where this conversation will
continue going forward.

<p>Let me introduce <a href="https://patchew.org/QEMU">Patchew</a>! Patchew was started when patchwork seemed to be mostly dead, so it is somewhat similar to Patchwork 2.0. But it has some nice functionality such as version comparison, pushing each submitted series to git (complete with Reviewed-by tags and the like), simple integration with testing and a <a href="https://patchew.org/api/v1/projects/">REST API</a>. It should also be quite easy to write new plugins to automatically parse syzbot or 0day emails and turn them into test failures.

Well, sourcehut is still in alpha.  But something that makes adoption easier than some other platforms is how modular the different sourcehut components are.  You can just use what you like.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Hellwig put in a good word for the Debian bug-tracking system, which allows most things to be done using email.</font><br>
<p>
...what? debbugs is a very old piece of software, and it shows. It's not scalable (ironically, bug pages for packages like Linux are among the ones that suffer the most), lacks even relatively simple features (cross-package bugs), lacks any integration with any other tooling, and is confusing to interact with for even the most experienced developers. The fact that changes happen through a custom command language, cannot be previewed before acted upon, are not realtime (you have to wait for your email to be processed) and often take a while to take full effect (due to caching) adds to the confusion. IIRC there were (heroic) attempts in the past to add a... SOAP interface to it but I don't think it's being used much (I may be wrong).<br>
<p>
I've been using the Debian BTS for 15 years and I often still struggle. It's probably one of the biggest demotivators I have while working in Debian. That's not a criticism to its maintainers - it was probably great in the 90s or early 00s and has improved a lot in the past few years, but it still pales in comparison to the tools that exist out there today (Phabricator/GitHub/GitLab etc.). Plus it really is a bug tracking system, not a patch management system, so it feels entirely off-topic to the discussion at hand (and my understanding is that Linux has Bugzilla for a BTS?). Patch management-wise, Debian never used its BTS for anything but drive-by small patch submission attached to emails. Most of us actually switched to a Debian-hosted version of GitLab for repository hosting, merge request management &amp; some (limited) CI recently and it has been an exciting journey.<br>
<p>
Beyond that, it has always puzzled me how the Linux kernel community -the community that invented and popularized git!- has remained so far behind in its tooling, and stuck in old ways. Bug tracking, code review, patch management/tracking, and CI all seem intertwined with each other and really require unified tooling to manage adequately, for seasoned and new developers alike. None of the tools out there are perfect (far from it), but the majority of them are /far/ better than tracking patches in emails. It amazes me that all this is controversial and would love to understand the reasons behind it better.<br>

Right, the pseudoheader requirement is a cheap way to prevent most spam in the form of new bugs, but does nothing to prevent spam to existing bugs.  For that we have little choice but to muddle along with traditional spam-detection tools and after-the-fact removal.  Unfortunately there would likely be an outcry if we started requiring accounts.<br>
<p>
(Systems that require accounts aren't immune to spam by any means, but having messages more systematically linked to identities does make some things a lot easier.)<br>

Not sure what you mean by that, but with debbugs there are a few things that seem related to what you said:<br>
<p>
Bugs can be in package foo but marked as affecting package bar.<br>
<p>
You can assign a bug to multiple packages when a change in any single package can fix the issue.<br>
<p>
You can mark a bug as being blocked by another bug.<br>
<p>
You can clone a bug and then reassign the clone, updating the blocked info at the same time.<br>
<p>
The usertags stuff seems relevant too.<br>

Are they?  I never really had any trouble tracking patches with email(*).<br>
To be a contender to the established method, a new tool must not only be better (which I agree that some are), it must also be no worse.  I find them all to be worse (as well as better).<br>
<p>
(*) the only real weakness with email is that I would sometimes miss patches.  A gentle reminder from the sender after a few weeks of silence always got things moving again and improved the sense of community - some times humans are better than mechanical solutions.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; We have many of the necessary pieces to do better, but there is also a lot of fragmentation. Every kernel subsystem does things differently; there is a distinct lack of identity for the kernel as a whole.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; ...</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There are at least seven major testing systems out there (he listed 0day, kernelci.org, CKI, LKFT, ktest, syzbot, and kerneltests) when we should just have one good system.</font><br>
<p>
Seven is too many. One would be too little. Not just to keep some competition alive but simply because the kernel is a really huge project and one size doesn't fit all.<br>
<p>
If you think test suites for Wifi, filesystems, graphics and schedulers can re-use validation tools and test code then... it's likely these common things are not even specific to the Linux kernel at all.<br>
<p>
Same for bug trackers: re-use is always good but a little diversity and competition doesn't hurt either and  again a Linux Wifi bug and a Linux filesystem bug don't really seem much closer to each other than to a bug in openssh or whatever. Granted: they can be tracked on the same git history. Who cares, I'm not even using that filesystem anyway.<br>
<p>
Even if all areas of the kernel ever use the exact same tools and processes one day, they should still run different _instances_ to keep things under reasonable and manageable size. Who still reads the lkml? People have been using more focused mailing lists for ages.<br>

That's the core issue. Tools and design choices will keep people bikesh... fascinated and busy discussing for years on end but without some actual and skilled manpower these discussions will forever keep going around in circles.<br>
<p>
Speaking of manpower, so-called "DevOps" and validation roles have since forever been less respected/funded/promoted than nobler "developer" roles and the Linux kernel is not much worse than the rest of the industry. Maybe it's changing? Very slowly as any culture change. I think we're starting to see conferences on these topics, did any mention the kernel? <br>

I can't speak to _unique_ but the "feature" is not rejecting as spam the stuff you've sent from your own mail server. The arc of this development can be read at ex-Symbolics Lisp/ex-Netscape hacker Jamie Zawinski's blog -- <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/tag/mail/">https://www.jwz.org/blog/tag/mail/</a> -- and shows that running your own email servers and communicating widely is hampered by proprietorial relays including Gmail, Microsoft, GoDaddy, Earthlink, Dreamhost and more. I get that spam has broken e-mail and that the paradox of allowing people to post to the SMTP-based social network means that you have to filter later if the posts made were unwanted or malicious.<br>
<p>
Kernel development is a social network with some patch transport and discussion in messages and concrete source trees backing these up. Metadata like 'acked-by' and which systems tested the changes or how to replicate found bugs, that stuff needs to annotate the patches and be searchable, then reputations need to be used to retain a high signal-to-noise ratio. And because it's a social network, where Linus (among others) goes, people will follow.<br>

Even with DKIM things are still super unreliable these days - systems will just take a random dislike to mail for reasons that are completely undocumented, and things that look a bit unusual (like technical mail) are especially prone to suffering problems.<br>

I wonder how many of them are using Gmail because of corporate mail setups that suck at dealing with large amounts of mail.<br>

Also, judging from the patches I see sent by Patch Author &lt;author@gmail.com&gt; with the author being Patch Author &lt;author@bigcorp.com&gt;, many corporate mail setups obviously suck at sending stuff as well, and people fall back to Gmail...<br>

There is a proposal floating around to have an open git server and allow anyone to submit patches using "git push" instead of "git-send-email".<br>
Exactly how that would work I'm not sure. but one of the things that I do like about gerrit is that submitting patches with "git push" is quite easy.<br>
Maybe that initiative could tip the balance away from gmail.<br>

<p>
Yes, that's the one.<br>
<p>
I think spam is a solvable problem.<br>
If you required the HEAD pushed to always have a signed tag, then you would have a basis for establishing reputation (and you would encourage tag signing, which is a *good* *thing*).<br>
<p>
If the signing key doesn't have reputation, the pushed information is limited in some way and it not forwarded to any (public) email lists.<br>
In that case, the author needs to copy some text that was returned by the server into an email message - which can be sent with any old MUA.  IT would include a link to find the patch.<br>
I'm not sure how reputation would be gained or revoke, but some combination of automatic flow analysis and crowd-sourcing (if 3 reputable keys vouch for a new key, it gets reputation?)<br>
<p>
You wrote that "support in git-daemon is needed" but I think it provides everything you need.  You can certainly enable anonymous push, and there are hooks that allow you to check any change to the repo before it happens, so you should be able to prototype something yourself.<br>

Modern cloud Office365 is perfectly fine as far as deliverability and email content integrity. As long as you don't use Outlook as a client of course.<br>
<p>
Where Linux really falls down is that all the usual tools we use for email don't support OAUTH2 - so you often can't actually login to the corp email server anyhow (be it gmail or office365 based). Sigh.<br>
<p>
And of course Office365 apparently doesn't support OAUTH for IMAP, only SMTP!<br>

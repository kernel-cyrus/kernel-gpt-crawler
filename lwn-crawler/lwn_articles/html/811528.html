By many accounts, the kernel project uses outdated tooling, far behind the
state of the art that Kids Today tend to favor.  The kernel's workflow has
worked well (enough) for years, but there are signs that it may not be
sustainable indefinitely.  As a result, there has been <a
href="/Articles/803619/">an ongoing conversation</a> about
improving the kernel's workflow, but little has changed so far.  The
<a
href="/ml/workflows/20200201030105.k6akvbjpmlpcuiky@chatter.i7.local/">posting
of a simple tool called <tt>get-lore-mbox</tt></a>
is a sign that the rate of change may be about to increase.
<p>
The kernel project's reliance on email strikes many as quaint and
antiquated.  It may indeed partly be a natural outcome of the aging nature
of the kernel community; many of the developers there, especially in the
important maintainer positions, got started well before tools like
web-based Git forges existed.  Indeed, some of them got started using punch
cards and may still be unconvinced of the virtues of, say, text editors.
But the truth of the matter is that there are a number of good reasons for
the kernel community's continued reliance on email; there is little else
that can handle a community of that size and diversity.
<p>
So, while it seems that the future of email (as opposed to, say,
proprietary services like Gmail) is
uncertain at best, the path toward a replacement in the kernel community is
unclear.  Developers will have to be convinced that any new tools
will make their lives better, not worse; busy maintainers have little
patience for "improvements" that slow things down.
<p>
The <tt>get-lore-mbox</tt> tool, posted by Konstantin Ryabitsev
is not the product of a vast development effort; it
adds up to about 500 lines of Python code.  Its core function is simple:
given the message ID for any email in a thread of interest, it will
download the entire thread from the <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/">lore.kernel.org</a> archive into a local
mbox file.  That alone can be useful for anybody who wants to catch up on
an email discussion that may have flown by, but there are some other useful
features:
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> With the <tt>-a</tt> option, only the actual patch series at the
     heart of the thread will be downloaded; it will be sorted and stored in a form
     suitable for passing directly to <a
     href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-am/1.7.0"><tt>git&nbsp;am</tt></a>.
     Any useful 
     tags posted as replies (Acked-by, for example) will be automatically
     added to the relevant patches.  
<li> The <tt>-t</tt> option will cause tags posted in replies to the series
     cover letter to be applied to all patches in the series.
<li> If the thread contains multiple versions of a patch series, the latest
     one will be stored; the <tt>-v</tt> option can be used to request a
     specific version if need be.
<li> If no message ID is provided, it will read a message from the standard
     input and extract the ID from there, making single-keystroke operation
     possible in a number of mail readers.
</ul>
<p>
Kernel maintainers tend to spend a lot of time reading through email
threads, organizing the patches found therein, applying tags, etc.  The
initial response to this tool (including on the private kernel.org users
list) has made it clear that they have been wanting 
something like this for a long time.  The developer time that will be saved
far outweighs the time it takes to write a gadget like this, but nobody has
ever created such a thing.
<p>
One might well wonder why this tool didn't appear until now.  It would seem
that there were two things that needed to happen before this work could be
done.  One of those was the creation of a reliable archive for kernel
mailing lists that could be easily queried by a program.  Reliable archives
have been scarce in general, and a single archive for all kernel-related
lists didn't exist at all; without that, there is nothing for a tool like
<tt>get-lore-mbox</tt> to obtain messages from.  The lore.kernel.org
archive has fixed that problem; it now seems like an indispensable part of
the kernel workflow, but 
it's worth remembering that it is <a href="/Articles/758034/">less than two
years old</a>.
<p>
Back in 1975, Fredrick Brooks wrote in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"><i>The Mythical
Man-Month</i></a> that an effective programming team should be organized
like a surgical team, with a set of people filling specific roles.  The
kernel certainly has its surgeon at the top, complete with many of the
traits that such professionals are known to display.  Brooks said that
every team should have two secretaries; the kernel community seems to be
able to get by without those.  But he
also said that each team needs a toolsmith, focused on creating the tools
that the team needs.
<p>
The kernel project has long lacked a toolsmith.  It doesn't even have
somebody who can collect the tools created by maintainers for their own needs
and make them suitable for more general use.  As a result, maintainers
often do without, or they
use tools they threw together themselves when they really needed to be doing
something else; that causes the community to lose a lot of opportunities for better
productivity overall.
<p>
One of the open secrets in the free-software world is that, while some
areas of development are well supported by companies, others tend to
languish.  Both within the kernel and beyond it, there are many pressing
needs that, it seems, are nobody's problem, so nobody is funded to work on
them.  The costs of this neglect are many: burned-out developers trying to
keep projects going in their spare time, security vulnerabilities, missing
tests and documentation, and a lack of tools needed by the community as a
whole, among others.
<p>
If only there were a successful industry consortium that could focus some
attention (and resources) on problems of this nature.  For the kernel there
is one, in the form of the Linux Foundation, which has indeed
supported the kernel community in a number of ways, including employing a
few key developers and taking over maintenance of the kernel.org system
after the 2011 compromise shone a spotlight on the consequences of neglect
there.  More recently, the Linux Foundation has supported the creation and
operation of lore.kernel.org — and the development of <tt>get-lore-mbox</tt> as
well.
<p>
The kernel workflow discussions have made it clear, though, that there is a
lot more work to be done in this area.  The kernel's processes and tools
have suffered from a lack of attention for many years; that is partly a
result of the fact that, on the surface, things are working smoothly.  The
kernel community has managed to organize itself well and functions at a
level that few other projects can match.  When the kernel community has
found the time to focus on tools — Git being the primary example — the
effects have rippled across the development community as a whole.  
But reaching that point has
required going through a number of crises when the kernel project's
processes proved unable to support the community.
<p>
It would be a great thing if the next big transition in the kernel's
development process could happen without the "crisis" part.  If sufficient
effort and resources go into the tools that the kernel community will need
in the coming years, that might just be possible.  That suggests that the
work being done at the Linux Foundation should not just continue, but grow
into something bigger.  Supporting this work (which requires getting its
member companies to support it) is one of the best things that the Linux
Foundation can do to support the kernel project as a whole.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's getting pretty tiring to hear constantly how terrible the Linux kernel development workflow is. For such a 'terrible' workflow it sure seems to have produced excellent results. Maybe it's not so terrible after all? Maybe, just maybe, it's actually a GOOD process and we should learn from it rather than dismiss it because it doesn't use 'hip' proprietary Microsoft-owned-and-controlled web interfaces. It seems to me that rather than saying 'what can the Linux kernel developers learn from Javascript kids on GitHub' we should be asking 'what can the Javascript kids on GitHub learn from Linux kernel development'. That's a question with a lot more answers that are a lot more interesting:<br>
<p>
1. You don't need a 'web interface' to use version control.<br>
2. You don't need a centralised repository for code hosted on a website.<br>
3. You don't need inaccessible proprietary software to discuss things, because email works very well for discussing things already.<br>
<p>
get-lore-mbox seems like a wonderful tool and ironically is only possible because the Linux kernel development process is done in the open through a standardised protocol. Projects that organise through GitHub, like the Rust project, have had an infamously terrible time trying to get the GitHub developers to give them any tools for scaling up their organisational efforts to big projects. <br>

Free software doesn't come from the corporate world and doesn't need the corporate world. People don't need to be 'funded' to work on free software. Not every piece of software needs corporate backing, a foundation, and corporate interference. Every decent piece of free software came from an single individual person working on something that they found interesting or that was personally useful to them. <br>

<p>
That may well be.  I happen to prefer the email-based workflow for patch review, mostly because the GUI code review tools I know about were all designed wrong. But I believe a better one could be made that would improve upon email-based workflows (at least for me).<br>
<p>
Elsewhere in this thread people are discussing `git send-email` as one reason why, so let me just bring up a different issue that folks tend to be unaware of or overlook: lack of context.<br>
<p>
Patches, by their nature, have limited context.  This can result in a few problems:<br>
  * It is not clear on which commit the patches should be applied on top of.  People use various strategies to avoid this problem ("applies on top of next", "meant to build on a merge of en/fill-directory-fixes-more and ds/sparse-checkout-harden", etc.), but it can be messed up and cause problems.  It has before.<br>
  * The limited context can result in patches applying "cleanly" but incorrectly.  I'm not talking about intrinsic problems like semantic conflicts, either, but stuff that is specific to patch-based workflows such as hunks being added to the wrong function in a file, or files placed in the wrong directory -- see [1], [2], and [3] for examples.  In fact, these problems are causing git to switch the default backend of git-rebase from the am-backend to the interactive/merge one, with likely deprecation of the am-backend to eventually follow[4].<br>

Dunno whether it applies elsewhere, but I believe Linus&#x27; workflow is that all patches are against the first version in the series, so if 5.12 is the latest kernel and he&#x27;s prepping 5.13, they all have to apply cleanly against 5.12.<br>
<p>
Then I guess once 5.13-rc1 comes out, they all have to apply cleanly against rc1, even if he&#x27;s up to rc8.<br>
<p>
Not proof against cock-ups, but I think interactive-merge would actually be a change for the worse in that case.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's getting pretty tiring to hear constantly how terrible the Linux kernel development workflow is. For such a 'terrible' workflow it sure seems to have produced excellent results.</font><br>
It is terrible, especially for newcomers or people who want to contribute just a small patch.<br>

Contributing just a small patch is completely trivial! You don't need to sign up for anything, you don't need to register on some proprietary website, you don't have to run proprietary Javascript and give your personal details to Microsoft. You just email a patch using git's *built in* patch-formatting tools.<br>

The last time I had to:<br>
1) Get special permission from IT to use IMAP for mail instead of regular Exchange protocol.<br>
2) Install imapproxy.<br>
3) Install mutt.<br>
4) Set up this whole shebang (which was NOT trivial at all).<br>
5) Finally be able to use git's mail capability (after misusing it once and spamming the LKML with an incomplete patch series).<br>
6) Learn how to use mutt to reply to emails with code reviews (newsflash: mutt sucks).<br>
<p>
Sorry, this is not trivial and is extremely convoluted compared to creating PRs on Github (and I've done quite a bit of drive-by contributions using it).<br>

It's not the rest of the world's fault that you're stuck using some terrible Micro$oft crap instead of standard email. So let's remove the first four of those, because they're entirely a you problem of you not already having the ability to *send email*, a pretty basic task in today's world. And we'll remove the last of them, because 'learn how to reply to emails' is also a pretty basic task you should also be capable of. There are loads of mail clients out there, nobody is forcing you to use mutt (which doesn't suck). <br>
<p>
The process is thus:<br>
<p>
Step 1. Learn how to use git's mail capability, for which there are countless articles, wiki pages, tutorials, man pages, etc.<br>
Step 2. There is no step 2, you have completed the process.<br>
<p>
It's extremely simple and easy.<br>

<p>
There's a big difference between "sending email" and "sending email in a way that doesn't corrupt patches".  Also, Microsoft tools aren't the only one that struggle there, as evidenced by the MUA-specific hints in the git documentation.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The process is thus:</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Step 1. Learn how to use git's mail capability, for which there are countless articles, wiki pages, tutorials, man pages, etc.</font><br>
<p>
Sometimes people know how to use git's mail capability, use it fine for years, and then something outside of git breaks.  For one example, see <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAP8UFD1hTc0dXWmiF6aW6=_7DhB8zhvzOXy9hEXrfvgWwimJ7g@mail.gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAP8UFD1hTc0dXWmiF6aW6=_7DhB8...</a>.  I too struggled with that same problem and remember spending *an entire day* attempting to figure out how to send my patches to git (and it wasn't the only time).  I may not be the sharpest tool in the drawer, but I've had hundreds of patches accepted into git.git so if I'm struggling and can point to a thread where other git developers couldn't figure it out themselves and were asking the list, perhaps it's not as trivial as you make it seem.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Step 2. There is no step 2, you have completed the process.</font><br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's extremely simple and easy.</font><br>
<p>
I have to disagree.  I still prefer the email process (see my three links on why I hate GitHub PRs and most gui code review tools in general[1]) and I think your point earlier in the thread that other projects should learn some good things from kernel development is spot on, but I certainly don't believe it's perfect or even above criticism.<br>

Outlook works perfectly fine for me. It does all I need from it: e-mail, contact management and discovery, shared calendars and meetings and so on. I have no problems with it, it just works.<br>
<p>
And my setup is bog-standard, I have nothing whatsoever unusual. If Linux development can't be used with this setup then perhaps it should re-examine itself?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; And we'll remove the last of them, because 'learn how to reply to emails' is also a pretty basic task you should also be capable of.</font><br>
The style of email communication used in LKML is not easy to replicate in Outlook or other mailers.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's extremely simple and easy.</font><br>
Compared to creating a PR on a git forge? No, it's not.<br>

Mostly because Linux is standard on the servers. And I'm using Outlook on Mac OS X, btw.<br>
<p>
Also, there's very little relation between the Linux kernel and the outdated mail tools used to develop it. <br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; (Personally, I consider Outlook and the pathological behaviours it encourages to be not unlike the poorly-thought-out slide decks that led to the Challenger disaster.)</font><br>
Or perhaps the Debian Disaster with removing out the entropy source because there was no code context visible (unlike in PRs in git forges)?<br>

Linux is often used for embedded devices (via Android, Yocto, etc), where everything is cross-compiled and there's no need for the development environment to be Linux. E.g. you can build Android on macOS, and I suspect you can build it on Windows with WSL, so you can do serious Linux kernel development work without having a Linux desktop.<br>

I would have thought it would be rather obvious to anyone that has ever USED outlook what is wrong with it: absolutely everything. <br>
<p>
In particular, though, your argument seems to be 'Outlook is fine because it has every feature you could possibly need' while also simultaneously claiming that the Linux kernel development process is broken because Outlook doesn't support it properly. That seems to suggest that Outlook doesn't have every feature you could possibly need...<br>

Nope. I'm saying that Outlook has features that I need (and other average corporate email users), not every feature under the sun. And it seems like it's kernel developers that need some strange behaviors from mail.<br>

I have never identified a design decision in Outlook that I like. I hate the default shortcuts, I hate how the buttons are laid out, I hate how the panes are laid out, I hate how the windows are laid out, I hate their horrible excuse for an implementation of standardised email protocols... everything about it is terrible.<br>

Sorry, but you've still not addressed the very valid question of what exactly is wrong.<br>

Not usable with the Linux kernel workflow could equally be a problem with the workflow and/or the eccentricities of the mail exchange being mandated?<br>

This makes me rant.<br>
<p>
Besides the usual nonsensical way that options, account setting or any entity are organised in MS Outlook (e.g. navigate from Advanced to Extra to whatever deeper and then end up again in the dialog the navigation started from, ESC deep down a dialog stack just ending the whole stack), its all-functionality-in-one-application is hell bound: load and startup times are terrible, memory usage is huge, etc etc. Having separate tools that do one thing good and work well together - sounds familiar ? - is much better. The balancing of tradeoffs at Microsoft its development process have very little to do with user demands and much more with squeezing out profits and locking customers in.<br>

Outlook is a Microsoft Exchange (as opposed to "email") client, requiring you to go all-in on Microsoft infrastructure on the backend if you're going to use even a fraction of its feature set.  It also requires use of non-Free operating systems.<br>
<p>
Both of those make Outlook a complete non-starter before we even get to feature sets.<br>

<p>
I've never used Outlook, so this is second hand but it appear to not support any straight forward method to reply separately to various points in an email.<br>
<p>
When people using Outlook have found the need to do this when replying to me they sometimes mark their comments in blue.  Sometimes put [MYNAME] near them.  Sometimes just interleave with my original text so I have to remember what I wrote so I can filter it out.<br>
In short, it hard to have a detailed multi-thread conversation with Outlook.<br>
<p>
Now imaging trying to do code review using Outlook - code review often requires multiple separate statements, and often needs each to be clearly tied to a specific line of code.<br>
<p>
I'm using gerrit in  project at present and once when I was grumbling about it at a conference, someone said they really like it because it allows you to comment on individual lines.  I thought "so what, I've been doing that with email for decades".  I subsequently discovered they used Outlook.  Enough said.<br>

Outlook defaults to top-posting, but it supports traditional point-by-point replies as well. It also has tools to quote and unquote blocks of text. Most people are just not exposed to them.<br>

Indeed, Outlook is not the best tool for it. Additionally, Outlook defaults to a proportional font which is nicer to read than monospace fonts. But it makes it a poor tool to edit or read code.<br>

I didn't know that - thanks.  How easy is it to enable?  Are there simple instructions I can point someone to?  "Please do *this* whenever you reply to me".. (It would need to work for the web-base outlook as well as the desktop app .... oh, and the phone app and ....)<br>

Maybe that simple fact is a big flaw in Outlock.  There is little point having functionality that people cannot find and don't even know to look for.  I know UI design is hard, but email is so ubiquitous that it really needs the work to be put in.<br>

      <blockquote>How easy is it to enable? Are there simple instructions I can point someone to? "Please do *this* whenever you reply to me"</blockquote>

<p>I was able to find <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-how-the-original-message-appears-in-replies-and-forwards-1207f4ea-f7cf-4cdf-9298-5982fa2e5e2f">these instructions</a> on Microsoft's website, though these are how to set the default rather than how to do it for an individual message.

<blockquote>Maybe that simple fact is a big flaw in Outlock. There is little point having functionality that people cannot find and don't even know to look for.</blockquote>

<p>Older, plain text email clients defaulted to prefixing every line with a quote character because that was the only practical way of quoting a message.  When newer clients started to support fancier formatting, that approach didn't work the same, so they used HTML-type quoting.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to have come up with an easy way to intersperse quotes and replies, so people defaulted to top posting.  That said, even with old-fashioned plain text quoting, there were plenty of people who top posted because it was faster than quote/reply formatting.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; though these are how to set the default rather than how to do it for an individual message. </font><br>
<p>
Thanks for the link.  I was afraid it might only be settable globally.  This related directly to my point below...<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; That said, even with old-fashioned plain text quoting, there were plenty of people who top posted because it was faster than quote/reply formatting. </font><br>
<p>
That's true and it doesn't bother me at all - providing they manage to communicate clearly.<br>
I really don't care about the format, but I would like people to think about the message that they want to send, and then to create the message accordingly.<br>
This means they need the tools available to create a useful message.  Sometimes top-posting is a perfectly good way to send a message, sometimes interleaving is best.  In the cases that I can think of that particularly bothered me, my correspondent clearly *was* trying to communicate usefully, but were impeded by their tool.<br>
Having the tools available needs them available on a message-by-message basis, not as a global setting.<br>
<p>
Having quote-with-prefix/quote-without-prefix/don't-quote as a global setting is a bit like having reply-to-sender/reply-to-all/forward be a global setting. (or html/plain-text being a global setting!!!)<br>

If you set it to "prefix each line", the precise behaviour depends on whether the original message is plain text or HTML, so you don't get the &gt; prefixing for HTML emails (instead you get a coloured border on the side, which is inoffensive and actually quite useful). It's not quite as good as if it let you set this per message, but in practice the way it works seems basically sane and actually a fairly reasonable approach.<br>
<p>
Also, when replying to a plain text email, it defaults to plain text so you don't need to change anything.<br>
<p>
I don't really want to defend Outlook too much since I kind of hate it, mostly for reasons not covered in this thread, but in this particular way I think its reputation is a bit unfair.<br>

I have yet to discover any way to configure it to work this way, at least with the Outlool 365 web client. If you know how to get this functionality, please share.<br>

Please stop with this elitist nonsense.<br>

I work at a large investment bank, which is a heavily regulated industry and the Operations are very paranoid that you could accidentally "wall-cross" some sensitive material information (this is within the company, not even leaking it outside!) which means that the working environment is tightly controlled and this means Windows and Outlook. (Which nowadays is not the steaming pile of dung I expected it to be.) I don't love it, but don't you dare tell me that some thing is wrong with *me*.<br>

I've made a few contributions to the Kernel and other Open Source projects, and while I agree it's not terrible, you can't just hand wave away your first step as "this is no big deal":<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There are loads of mail clients out there, nobody is forcing you to use mutt (which doesn't suck). </font><br>
<p>
The number that you can actually use to send patches and reply to mail on the LKML is a lot smaller than you'd expect/like. And with that, besides outlook I don't know *anybody* who uses a desktop mail client anymore - the only time I ever use one is for sending/receiving patches and mail on the LKML and other mailing lists. And the GMail web interface (by far the most popular to use) in particular does not work for the LKML, because it wraps lines at 80 characters and does other silly things, so you can't send patches using that even if you wanted too. It also doesn't support a threaded view of conversations that you obviously need for most (all) mailing lists, so replying to emails via that (which is "supposed to be easy") is also largely impossible.<br>
<p>
With that, the list of desktop mail clients is slim and getting slimmer (because nobody uses them...) and `mutt` is the only one I had much success with for the LKML. There `alpine`, which is just as messy to get working as `mutt` in my experience, and there's also `evolution` which somewhat works but requires some settings to get right. I mean, just look at the kernel documentation for setting up your email client:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.5/process/email-clients.html">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.5/process/email-client...</a><br>
<p>
The fact that it even needs a page that long with a bunch of weird settings should indicate things are a lot messier than you're suggesting. And the only time anybody is ever going to use any of those programs is when they're sending patches, they're otherwise useless tools for almost everybody.<br>
<p>
My last point is the big one - the process is no longer "use your existing email client to do this", instead it has become "install and configure one of these obscure programs to interact with our system".<br>

<p>I know a lot of people who use web-mail as their interface for their personal mail.  It seems to me that it has two big advantages:

<ol><li>It doesn't require they install a new piece of software on their computer.
<li>It requires no configuration.</ol>

<p>These are big advantages for people who aren't very computer savvy, not that "aren't very computer savvy" describes many kernel contributors.

I have used the GMail web interface for almost all of my interaction with Linux mailing lists since 2009, except for:<br>
1. Sending patches (git send-email using the SMTP server of my ISP),<br>
2. Replying to patches on mailing lists I'm not subscribed to, and thus downloaded from lore or patchwork (alpine is still in my fingers).<br>

Yes, GMail has lost the ability to not corrupt patches copy-'n-pasted to the web interface many years ago :-(<br>

What exactly does Gmail break?  Is it just line wrapping or is it anything else?<br>
<p>
I do work on Gmail, if there&#x27;s a clear test case maybe I could try and fix this.  Though I&#x27;m a little afraid of touching that part of the code base as there are a lot of tools which parse emails, and I wouldn&#x27;t know if my change broke something until too late.<br>
<p>
I suppose more usefully, how would I test this?  I could generate a patch with git, copy it into gmail (after the fix), send it to myself and copy the body from gmail web into a .patch file, which I feed to git?<br>
Or would I need to set up mutt or something in order to get the email in a form git likes?  I haven&#x27;t sent patches by email successfully before.<br>
<p>
Can you include the patch file as an attachment instead?  <br>

Gmail hard-wraps plaintext mails at 78 columns. It should stop doing so. Fixing this in gmail would also make its plaintext emails more readable on mobile devices. <br>
<p>
Other popular mailers have stopped doing hardwrapping years ago, and now simply send long lines as long lines, without inserting any extraneous linebreaks. In order to remain compliant with SMTP standards, which prohibits long lines, you must encode the message as quoted-printable if the lines are too long. But, quoted-printable encoding is reversible and transparent to the content, unlike inserting hard linebreaks.<br>
<p>
A previous solution to the mobile problem was to use text/plain;format=flowed, but that format=flowed was a complex spec that had many problems of its own, and never interoperated well. It&#x27;s fallen out of favor in recent decades (yes, decades!!!), in favor of simply never hard-wrapping text/plain content.<br>

<p>
It&#x27;s vague in my memory, but I am almost certain that wrapping around 72 and definitely before 80 is *required* for email user agents.<br>
<p>
Yes, yes, it is commonly ignored for pasted or included content, but any email program that you type into is supposed to wrap long line at some point before 80, leaving room for at least three levels of quotes, like &quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; which is six. So at least 74, more likely 72. 78 is being overly generous really.<br>
<p>
This kind of sounds like someone complaining about Google&#x27;s GMail *following standards*. Weird.<br>

There&#x27;s no hard requirement that user agents wrap text - it&#x27;s convention to do so for the purposes of quoting stuff on 80 characters wide terminals, but doing so is inherently lossy when using plain ASCII (there&#x27;s no way to tell the difference between a 72-character line followed by an 8-character line and an 80-character line that got hard wrapped). RFC5322 does say that agents SHOULD place a 78-character restriction on line length, but the context provided makes it pretty clear that it&#x27;s talking about written language rather than code.<br>

Using attachments is not an option, as it makes it hard to comment on attached patches.<br>
<p>
Test procedure:<br>
<p>
1. Generate patch with &quot;git format-patch -1&quot;,<br>
2. Revert top change using &quot;git reset --hard HEAD^&quot;,<br>
2. Open patch with e.g. gedit,<br>
3. Paste patch into email body using gmail web interface,<br>
4. Send email,<br>
5. Open received email,<br>
6. Select &quot;Download message&quot; from triple-dot menu,<br>
7. Apply patch using &quot;git am&quot; (should apply cleanly),<br>
8. Use &quot;git diff&quot; to check tree contents (should match state with step 1).<br>
<p>
The above used to work, until Gmail started replacing TABs in pasted patches by spaces several years ago.<br>
More things may have been broken afterwards (e.g. forced line break).<br>

Thanks a lot!<br>

(Sorry for posting this so late; I've just got around to reading the comments here.)<br>
<p>
FastMail.com is a web mail provider built around the Cyrus IMAP server, a FOSS project to which FastMail make significant contributions (eg., JMAP). <br>
<p>
As a FastMail customer*, I currently just use their web interface, but I previously used their IMAP interface with no difficulty.<br>
*Full disclosure: I am a very satisfied FastMail customer.<br>
<p>
Unlike gmail, FastMail does not mangle leading whitespace or long lines (at least in the simple test I just performed).<br>
<p>
So maybe FastMail would be very useful to kernel developers. Does anyone use it?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; My last point is the big one - the process is no longer "use your existing email client to do this", instead it has become "install and configure one of these obscure programs to interact with our system".</font><br>
<p>
Thing is, there's a thing called "the principle of least surprise". And MOST GUI systems absolutely *love* to ignore it. If you use an email client that abides by it, you should not have any difficulty communicating with the linux project.<br>
<p>
That's why a lot of MS products are so awful - they keep breaking this principle. As soon as someone starts thinking "why the f... is this happening?" there's a problem with the tool. And if the answer isn't blindingly obvious in hindsight (it should be obvious in foresight, too, but that really IS hard) then the tool is broken. Sadly, this is true of a heck of a lot of today's tools.<br>

<p>
We hope to adapt Git's GitGitGadget [1] to make it possible to submit Github PRs against the kernel tree. This should help with this particular problem without introducing any hard dependencies. This is slightly more difficult than for Git, since there isn't a single mailing list where all patches are sent, but hopefully this obstacle is not insurmountable.<br>
<p>
Similarly, we hope to add an alternative frontend to GitGitGadget that wouldn't be tied to Github and can be used with any git hosting service -- such that anyone who is able to host a git tree somewhere on the net can provide an URL, a branch, and a cover letter to have the service automatically submit a patch series to the proper location for review.<br>

<p>This is literally one of the things that <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure">Pagure</a> tries to offer. It doesn't <i>exactly</i> fit the Linux kernel's requirements right now, since it doesn't know how to process <code>MAINTAINERS</code> and send the message to the correct subsystem mailing lists based on what the diff includes. Nor does it have a mode for sending it as a traditional patch series with a cover letter + diffstat based on the PR description. But Pagure could be easily extended to provide that functionality.</p>

<p>But being most of the way there to supporting that, while being completely Free Software (GPLv2+) and supporting an open data model (all project data in Pagure is stored as git repositories and can be manipulated with Git) makes it a worthy option to consider and contribute to make it work for the kernel, right?</p>

<p>Sourcehut itself <i>does</i> improve things from the "dumb" email model (such as basically integrating Patchwork's functionality), but itself does not provide any reasonable workflow improvements.</p>

What you are saying about the email-based workflow that git was designed from the start to be used with is simply, factually, objectively wrong. Saying that it "isn't workable" isn't just incorrect, it's ignorant.<br>
<p>
However if you put even the most basic research into sourcehut you'd know that the major goal of the website is to build online web-based contribution tools that use the "unworkable" email workflow underneath.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; 1) Get special permission from IT to use IMAP for mail instead of regular Exchange protocol.</font><br>
<p>
Officially, Exchange is not a protocol. It is not regular either. It uses MAPI, a proprietary protocol, that Microsoft tries to force onto their users as they do with their other garbage including their advertisements. That protocol does not even have an RFC.<br>
<p>
To be honest, they officially state they allow you to also use standard protocols like IMAP and POP3, but in many cases you need to wire in your mailbox as an Exchange mailbox, for example on smartphones. (Fortunately you can do this with Gmail, so you are able to use 2 proprietary technologies at once.)<br>
<p>
This misinformation and behavior is no surprise from Microsoft however.<br>

"You just email a patch using git's *built in* patch-formatting tools."<br>

This is a nice throwaway, but try doing it without having a full email server you've run yourself for 20 years, or without access to port 25 due to ISP, or company firewalls.<br>

Setting up git-send-email isn't trivial, compared to using gitlab or github. (gitlab isn't microsoft and used by a lot of things).<br>

      <p>Port 25 can also be used, as it was used for years, and can <em>still</em> be used, by all email servers that I am aware of, as the client-to-server email submission port.

<p>Port 587 is completely redundant. It even uses the exact same protocol as that which runs on port 25. You can just set up your firewall rules to translate traffic on port 587 to port 25, and email submission will still work without any other changes. Just use port 25.

The advantage of using port 587 for client submission is that as a mail server operator you get to apply a different set of policies to connections on that port. For example, submitting e-mail on port 587 often requires the STARTTLS and SMTP-AUTH features (among others), which you can't insist on for server-to-server e-mail delivery on port 25.
</p>
<p>
In point of fact, various ISPs block clients from accessing TCP port 25 anywhere on the Internet, and force them to submit e-mail on the ISP's own mail servers on port 587 with encryption and authentication (and possibly rate-limited), as a spam-reduction measure.

<p>I think this gets to the core problem with email as a tool: it no longer works the way people expect it to.  Spam and the responses to spam have fundamentally broken email.  It is no longer easy to set up a server that reliably communicates with the rest of the world.  Demanding that developers use a particular email setup in order to work on the kernel is thus a serious barrier to entry.

587 is not redundant at all. You will typically open 25 without auth (to receive third-party messages), and 587 with auth (to allow your users to create new messages). The security pipeline is different.<br>

When I find that I cannot comprehend something, I usually discover that I have to work harder on my own comprehension abilities.<br>
<p>
For instance, as far as I can see, people here are describing challenges that revolve around sending and receiving email in the specific way that git expects, rather than expressing an inability to send or reply to email in general. Most people have email set-ups that don't work the way that git assumes (including you, I think! You do have a gmail account, yes?), and struggle to find out strategies that can enable them to better work with it.<br>

I've been working on this for a while now, and am getting close to keeping my mutt &amp; exim kernel workflow scheme working post-oauth-apocalypse.<br>

I have mail inflow working using OAUTH and a REST transport from my Office365 and GMail accounts.<br>
<p>
While it seems trivial to say 'oh just use OAUTH' it actually turned out to be quite difficult to wrangle all the peices properly.<br>
<p>
I haven't put the last parts in to send email yet, but internally the tool does have the bearer token to authorize SMTP. It needs plumbing into the MTA. Maybe next month. Still waiting for Office365 to actually have a way to send raw email with OAUTH, as MS promised to finally do 4 months ago. Maddening.<br>
<p>
But yes, setting this all up is expert level stuff, not something you could expect someone who wants to just use git send-email to sort out. I'm mildly hopeful that someone will build a git plugin that can send email through gmail/o365 fully natively with 0 configuration.. At least for gmail sending email via REST is fairly straightfoward once you get the OAUTH token.<br>

      And if your Gsuite admin doesn't allow creating app tokens (mainly to force all authentication through 2FA through custom auth), what do you do then?

      <p>This is an unreasonable response. I can count on one hand the number of projects that <code>$DAYJOB</code> relies on that still use email-based workflows for submitting fixes. (Hint: it's only three, and one we don't usually contribute to!) That's out of literally hundreds of projects and the three Linux distributions we contribute to.</p>

<p>There are a number of other concerns that prevent enabling weak app tokens. Most of them are around compliance and preventing account hijacking. Accounts of engineers are often way more privileged than non-engineers. At <code>$DAYJOB</code>, compliance requirements have forced us to mandate it for everyone since we try to maintain a relatively open environment for employees in the company.</p>

<p>As an aside, executive assistants (who you call "secretaries") tend to handle pretty sensitive stuff, and they're usually quite smart. They handle a different problem domain than engineers do, and it's a hard one. I miss being able to ask one to help me with doing travel arrangements and payment work. Doing it myself is a lot of complicated work...</p>

<p>
Well, of course "secretaries" handle a (very) different problem domain than engineers.  (And one of their more challenging responsibilities is insulating executives from the effects of their own policies)<br>
<p>
...Meanwhile, that is precisely why each group should have tools catering to their particular needs.<br>

This is a straw man. Plenty of people have perfectly valid email accounts, capable of exchanging messages with any other email account, but no straightforward way to use them with git-send-mail. Webmail and Exchange users probably outnumber traditional SMTP/POP3/IMAP clients at this point, and by a large margin.<br>

Not to mention some of these issues are either caused by some company using such providers for email mainly gsuite and exchange. Not to mention some peoplemaybe having some email from school days and maybe unwill change email address for example. there need to wrappers for webmail provider to deal with non standard protocols or other auth method (oAuth2 or 2-FA) so they can be used with tradition workflows.<br>

So.. the highly-successful and supremely-productive linux kernel development process needs to rethink its tooling because your employer deliberately chose to use (and configure) its email systems without considering the needs of its engineering staff?<br>
<p>
The entire Linux kernel mentality is centered around Fixing Things the Right Way(tm), ie identifying the root cause of problems rather than adding endless layers of workarounds, and that extends to its tooling.  If the tools are shitty, then make better ones.  Telling them that they need to throw out the tooling they built to be maximally productive because other folks insist on using shitty tooling is not an argument that will gain traction.<br>

You're right, at any given point in time, you can't absolutely know what your users will need at some point in the future, which is why there must be a process for new needs/requirements to be captured, evaluated, and supported.  After all, IT is a strategic asset that empowers your colleagues to leverage agile design methodologies to deliver maximum value through effective business analysis to diverse stakeholders while upholding the highest standards of quality and integrity.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, back in the real world, every engineering group I've ever worked for/with has had to set up some sort of shadow IT infrastructure in order to do their jobs.  <br>

The entire federated XMPP userbase is barely a rounding error when compared to even one of the current IM silos.<br>
<p>
...And if you think getting a usable semi-custom email workflow is too difficult... XMPP is an order of magnitude worse, with significantly worse tooling.<br>
<p>
(I still have an XMPP server going for my domains.  In the past few years, I've received a total of *zero* non-spam messages..)<br>

XMPP has failed to get any traction because none of the implementations could be expected to be reasonably compatible with each other.  That was the practical consequence of being extensible and having different features bolted on.  Matrix has higher momentum now<br>

It's actually quite easy.<br>
<p>
Email is so fantastically unfit for purpose, it's not even worth talking about.<br>
<p>
WhatsApp and Signal have long replaced email for person-to-person communication for me. It's encrypted by default, and doesn't require me pulling out my hair out gauging out the eyes of whoever I want to communicate with, to setup encrypted communications.<br>

Try doing that with email without getting granny to jump off the cliff.<br>

Eh. I found the *submission* to be trivial (I use mutt as my daily mail driver though, so the stuff Cyberax lamented was handled by my stock setup years ago). Visibility into its *status* is what *really* sucks. Has it been triaged? Ignored? Lost in the firehose? I only get feedback when some step is complete (CI, review, etc.). I'd like to see CI results as they're happening. I'd like to have a nice way of collating the review feedback instead of having to wrangle and manage it myself (e.g., trailer collation, a tiny TODO list from comments). Tracking patch review versions is hard since (apparently) maintainers prefer fresh threads for each patchset version. Is the patchset I'm looking at the latest edition? If not, can I get a link to it? Reverse links would be nice as well.<br>
<p>
I understand why things are the way they are, but incremental improvement is possible. I've discussed this before[1] on here[2].<br>

Completely agree, except for the git point.<br>
<p>
I cannot easily send from git (need to hand-edit the output then feed it into /usr/sbin/sendmail on another machine), and people often don’t accept git format-patch output as attachments.<br>

Back before git, or in the BSDs, where you’d just post inline or attached unidiffs, things were/are easier.<br>

1. What prevents you from having git-send-email on the machine that has /usr/sbin/sendmail? Or configure git to ssh into that machine for running sendmail?<br>
2. Patches created by git-format-patch are very similar to unidiffs, so you can just post them inline like before.<br>

Of course things could be better -- but reasonable folks disagree on what "better" actually means.<br>
<p>
Enabling easier contributions from relative newbies is laudable, but if that requires you to kneecap your most productive folks by making their highly refined workflows unworkable, they're going to resist you, and for good reason.<br>
<p>
I mean, one could make a decent argument about how if you're not capable of hooking up git-send-email, you probably aren't going to be able to handle the much greater technical challenges of landing actual changes to the kernel itself.  Call it a basic weedout task if you will.<br>
<p>
Another way of looking at it is that if you want to develop Linux kernel code, you need to use Linux kernel tools and workflows.  This is hardly controversial; after all, if you want to develop an iOS app, you are forced to use Xcode on a Mac.  Or Android Studio for Android apps, or Visual Studio (on Windows) for Windows applications.  Or Vivado for wrangling Xilinx FPGAs.  Or.. Or.. Or.  Each of those embodies not just a different workflow, but the culture and mentality necessary to be truly productive.<br>
<p>
So by all means, let's make things better.  But it behoves us to listen to those who have been slogging away in the trenches and see what they come up with, lest we end up with the workflow equivalent of the Chauchat rifle.<br>

So an email gateway should probably be provided for them. But it's probably a good idea to recognize that the very specialized kernel workflow is a significant barrier.<br>

I actually developed a non-trivial kernel module in MS VS a while ago, using a third-party tool for GDB integration and remote debugging and editing...<br>

The inverse is also doable, with MinGW+gcc you can compile binaries for Windows on Linux (and run them with WINE).<br>

A classic case of the "success fallacy": "because Linux is winning, every aspect of its development process is justifiably excellent".<br>
<p>
The success fallacy holds up right up to the point where a project starts losing, at which point everyone toggles to the failure fallacy: "the project is losing, so its development process must be bad (and we always knew it)".<br>

Other subjects of the success fallacy: microservices, Python decision-making, Windows in the 1990s, Chrome.<br>

Of course, the "them javascript kids" attitude is why average age of a kernel maintainers rises every year by about one year[1]. Which is going to create problems a couple decades down the line. <br>

Famous last words: "email just works!"<br>
<p>
More seriously: we can discuss tools, habits and preferences until the cows come home but this:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Reliable archives have been scarce in general, and a single archive for all kernel-related lists didn't exist at all; [...] it's worth remembering that it is less than two years old.</font><br>
<p>
... was utterly, definitely, incredibly, astoundingly, unarguably wrong. I totally understand (!= agree) all the points about closed source software and vendor lock-in[1],  slow and bloated web-only interfaces[2], decentralization to resist nuclear wars, but... EPHEMERAL code reviews, seriously? Is it so difficult to understand that some projects preferred early versions and review comments to be "trapped" in the centralized database of some evil corporation/software rather than... lost!?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; without that, there is nothing for a tool like get-lore-mbox to obtain messages from.</font><br>
<p>
Ooohhh... look: a central database to store code reviews. A new, ground breaking concept /s. Long live the very first SEQL client (Standardized Email Query Language). Or was pwclient the first one?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; given the message ID for any email in a thread of interest</font><br>
<p>
"Unique key". Etc.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; there is little else that can handle a community of that size and diversity.</font><br>
<p>
The "size of the kernel" consideration is really overrated.<br>
<p>
There's at least one other, highly successful, open-source project of similar size that never used email for code reviews: the user-space operating system named "Chrome" [3]. The workflow is different and I'm certainly not pretending Gerrit would work for the kernel. Still, it's worth nothing the number of commits per month is in the same range (and the CI in a different league) despite Gerrit being one of the grand-daddies. Worst kept secret: a centralized database scales better because it's much easier to filter noise than with a mailing-list. In fact it can lead to staying "too focused" when email (!) notifications are misconfigured.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; But he also said that each team needs a toolsmith, focused on creating the tools that the team needs. [...] Both within the kernel and beyond it, there are many pressing needs that, it seems, are nobody's problem, so nobody is funded to work on them.</font><br>
<p>
Admittedly the complete opposite of Chrome and Android (which gave  most of their tools away)<br>
<p>
<p>
[1] gitlab is an _open-source_ clone of github and a better one in a number of ways <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/20339#note_281074449">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/20339#note_28...</a> I had to use recently and while not perfect I've been very impressed, well done. Debian adopted it.<br>
<p>
[2] ... which actually have decent CLIs more often than you think; how do you think CI works? Wait, you don't have any "plug and play" CI with email, need some elbow grease? Sorry about that. SEQL FTW?<br>
<p>
[3] you know it's not a joke: <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os</a><br>

<p>
After second thought, I don't see why you couldn't have one code review database per subsystem and pull requests between them. The kernel already has multiple mailing-lists after all. While desirable, they wouldn't even need to be all "locked-in" in the same software.<br>

Heh!  I cannot but plead guilty to charges as read on the first part of that statement!!!<br>

That said, one of the first screen-oriented editors I ever used featured a physical knob that you turned to move the cursor through the text.  512x512 pixels, any color you wanted as long as it was either a pale green or a moderate grey, and frame buffers are for wimps!<br>

But for me, nothing quite like a few years using punched cards and punched tape to build an appreciation for even line-oriented editors like "ed".<br>

      If we still used punch cards we wouldn't need to be bothered with questions like "is the newline character a text line separator or a terminator." I.e. should a text file end with a line feed character or not. Also, no more hard to read overlong code lines.

Well, when the company I worked for first got a daisywheel printer, we discovered we actually needed &lt;cr&gt; to be carriage return, and &lt;lf&gt; to be linefeed. The printer driver read the print file line by line, with a maximum line length of 256. If your line was more than 256 characters long (easily achieved if you wanted bold text on an 80-char line) the driver stuck a line-feed in, splitting what should be one line on to two.<br>
<p>
So imho, the *nix convention "line feed means carriage return" is actually broken ...<br>

Bytes were expensive back then!  But yes, some of the old drivers would add the &lt;cr&gt; for you.  If properly configured, anyway.  :-/<br>

The line feed character represents a newline at a higher abstraction level. Unix uses the line feed character to represent a line break in a text file. This has little to do with what character(s) are actually output when the file is sent to a terminal or a printer; the translation is done by the terminal line driver. How the newline should be output is determined by the line settings.<br>
<p>
The same goes for input: conventionally, the Return (CR) key is used to terminate a line when typing on a (virtual) terminal, but the line break ends up as a line feed character in a file or in the input to a process.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;But reaching that point has required going through a number of crises when </font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;the kernel project's processes proved unable to support the community.</font><br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;It would be a great thing if the next big transition in the kernel's development </font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;process could happen without the "crisis" part.</font><br>
<p>
Why's that?<br>
<p>
The long pressure-cooker experience culminating in a crisis is _exactly_ the process that "gives birth" to something beautiful and of real value.<br>
<p>
Self-realization is a process which is proved with pain, whether you're talking about source control for the kernel, the declaration of independence, or human life itself.<br>

So I am going out on a limb and say that the linux kernel environment has had 3 secretaries over the years that would meet Brooks' criteria:<br>
<p>
1. The mailing lists. Most of the data is stored and 'collated by grep' for a long time and was more what a 1975 secretary would do with meetings, notes and documents.<br>
2. The git repository. Again keeping track of the source code, who did what and when, why they did it and recaps of decisions.<br>
3. LWN. Jonathan Corbet has done a 20+ year service to the communities for the work he and the other LWN contributors have done to make the high lights of the decisions available to the general audience of 'other groups' needing that information.<br>
<p>
The tool maker is definitely something that various people have never had time for full-time and instead has been done ad-hoc.<br>

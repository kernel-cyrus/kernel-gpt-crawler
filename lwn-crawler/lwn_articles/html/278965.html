<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 23, 2008</br>
           </div>
That shiny new 2.6.25 kernel which was released on April 16 is now ancient
history; some 3500 changesets have been merged into the mainline git
repository since then.  Some of the most significant user-visible changes
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> New drivers for Korina (IDT rc32434) Ethernet MACs, 
     SuperH MX-G and SH-MobileR2 CPUs,
     Solution Engine SH7721 boards,
     ARM YL9200, Kwikbyte KB9260, Olimex SAM9-L9260, and emQbit ECB_AT91
     boards,
     Digi ns921x processors,
     the Nias Digital SMX crypto engines,
     AMCC PPC460EX evaluation boards,
     Emerson KSI8560 boards,
     Wind River SBC8641D boards,
     Logitech Rumblepad 2 force-feedback devices,
     Renesas SH7760 I2C controllers, and
     SuperH Mobile I2C controllers.

<p>

<li> The PCI subsystem now supports PCI Express Active State Power 
     Management, which can yield significant power savings on suitably
     equipped hardware.
<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>security=</tt> boot parameter which allows the
     specification of which security module to use if more than one are
     available. 
<p>
<li> Network address translation (NAT) is now supported for the SCTP,
     DCCP, and UDP-Lite protocols.  There is also netfilter connection
     tracking support for DCCP.
<p>
<li> The network stack can now negotiate selective acknowledgments and window
     scaling even when syncookies are in use.
<p>
<li> Another long series of network namespace patches has been merged,
     continuing the long process of making all networking code
     namespace-aware.
<p>
<li> Mesh networking support has been added to the mac80211 layer.  It is
     currently marked "broken," though, until various outstanding issues
     are fixed.
<p>
<li> 4K stacks are now the default for the x86 architecture.  This change
     is controversial and could be reversed by the time the final release
     happens. 
<p>
<li> SELinux now supports "permissive types" which allow specific domains
     to run as if SELinux were not present in the system at all.
<p>
<li> A number of enhancements have been made to the realtime group
     scheduler, including multi-level groups, the ability to mix processes
     and groups (and have them compete against each other for CPU time),
     better SMP balancing, and more.
<p>
<li> Support for the running of SunOS and Solaris binaries has been
     removed; it has long been unmaintained and did not work well.
<p>
<li> The kernel now has support for read-only bind mounts, which provide a
     read-only view into an otherwise writable filesystem.  This feature
     (the implementation of which was more involved than one might think)
     is intended for use in containers and other situations where even
     processes running as root should not be able to modify certain
     filesystems. 

</ul>
<P>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> At long last, support for the KGDB interactive debugger has been 
     added to the x86 architecture.  There is a DocBook document in the
     Documentation directory which provides an overview on how to use this
     new facility.
<p>
<li> Page attribute table (PAT) support is also (again, at long last)
     available for the x86 architecture.  PATs allow for fine-grained
     control of memory caching behavior with more flexibility than the
     older MTRR feature.  See <a
     href="/Articles/278994/">Documentation/x86/pat.txt</a> for more
     information. 
<p>
<li> Two new functions (<tt>inode_getsecid()</tt> and
     <tt>ipc_getsecid()</tt>), added to support security modules and the
     audit code, provide general access to security IDs associated with
     inodes and IPC objects.  A number of superblock-related LSM callbacks
     now take a <tt>struct path</tt> pointer instead of <tt>struct
     nameidata</tt>.  There is also a new set of hooks providing
     generic audit support in the security module framework.
<p>
<li> The now-unused ieee80211 software MAC layer has been removed; all of
     the drivers which needed it have been converted to mac80211.  Also
     removed are the sk98lin network driver (in favor of skge) and bcm43xx
     (replaced by b43 and b43legacy).
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/273731/">generic semaphores
     patch</a> has been merged.  The semaphore code also has new
     <tt>down_killable()</tt> and <tt>down_timeout()</tt> functions.
<p>
<li> The <tt>ata_port_operations</tt> structure used by libata drivers now
     supports a simple sort of operation inheritance, making it easier to
     write drivers which are "almost like" existing code, but with small
     differences. 
<p>
<li> A new function (<tt>ns_to_ktime()</tt>) converts a time value in
     nanoseconds to <tt>ktime_t</tt>.
<p>
<li> The final users of <tt>struct class_device</tt> have been converted to
     use <tt>struct device</tt> instead.  If all goes well, the
     <tt>class_device</tt> structure will be removed later in the 2.6.26
     cycle. 
<p>
<li> Greg Kroah-Hartman is no longer the PCI subsystem maintainer, having
     passed that responsibility on to Jesse Barnes.
<p>
<li> The seq_file code now accepts a return value of <tt>SEQ_SKIP</tt> from
     the <tt>show()</tt> callback; that value causes any accumulated output
     from that call to be discarded.

</ul>
<p>

Needless to say, this development series is still young and, as of this
writing, the merge window has over a week to run.  So there will be a lot
more code going into the mainline before the shape of 2.6.26 becomes clear.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The removed one is ieee80211_softmac not ieee80211. ipw2100/2200 still requires the latter.

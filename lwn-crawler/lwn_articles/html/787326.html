Computer memory architecture is growing more complex over time, with
different types of memory attached to a CPU via a number of paths.  The
kernel development community is duly working to make this memory available
to user space in an equally diverse set of ways.  Two sessions at the 2019
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit presented possible
mechanisms and APIs to allow programs to work with the types of memory they
need.
<p>
<h4>The heterogeneous memory mapper</h4>
<p>

One upcoming development
is the "<a
href="https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/hmmap">heterogeneous
memory mapper</a>" (hmmap), which was presented by Adam Manzanares in a
combined storage and memory-management session.

Hmmap is implemented as a character device that can map different kinds of
memory into a process's address space.  It is intended to provide both
direct and cached access, possibly at the same time (though via different
address ranges).  Cache management is flexible, with pluggable strategies;
the page cache is good for most workloads, Manzanares said, but some may
prefer alternatives.  The actual cache management to use can be specified
by the user.  Internally, hmmap is implemented in two layers, one handling
caching strategy and one for low-level access to the underlying media.
<p>
Why might one want this?  It provides flexibility for different device
types, allowing users to mix and match technologies like DAX, RDMA, and basic
block devices.  It provides the pluggable caching strategies, though he

<a href="/Articles/787351/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/AdamManzanares-sm.jpg" alt="[Adam Manzanares]"
title="Adam Manzanares" class="lthumb"></a>

allowed that he's not fully convinced that this feature is needed.  It is
an alternative to supporting DAX via NUMA nodes that does not require
hardware support.  It also provides a clear path to persistent storage,
something that is more implicit with the NUMA approach.
<p>
Manzanares was quickly accused of reimplementing the page cache, a
criticism that he partially accepted.  Perhaps, he suggested, some of the
features provided by hmmap could be put into the page cache itself
instead.  James Bottomley noted that one advantage of hmmap is that it can
be shrunk more quickly than the normal page cache can be; perhaps a policy
could be developed to exploit that capability.
<p>
Mel Gorman said that he was having a hard time seeing the use case for
hmmap.  Existing kernel functionality, like dm-cache or bcache, can be
used already for many storage-acceleration applications.  One potentially
interesting use case could be a device with directly accessible memory that
could be put to use as additional RAM on the system; data could be moved to
and from ordinary RAM on demand.  This device would differ from others in
that the data would not be stored in any persistent media.
<p>
With regard to dm-cache in particular, he said, it seems that it can handle
part of 
this use case; it works like a page cache, moving pages between faster and
slower devices.  It is inefficient for some kinds of workloads, though,
where it ends up touching large amounts of memory.  Persistent memory is
better for moving smaller amounts of memory efficiently; it could benefit
from a software layer that can take advantage of that.  
<p>
Other potential uses are harder to lay out.  Gorman suggested that
Manzanares should enumerate the use cases for this feature and explain why
currently available solutions are not good enough.  He suggested that
hmmap is an implementation of dm-cache with a different API.  As the
session ended, Manzanares
said that he would look more deeply into dm-cache and outline any changes
that would be needed to make it more widely applicable.

<p>
<h4>hbind()</h4>
<p>
The other proposal was described by Jérôme Glisse in a memory-management
track session on the final day.  Glisse has been working with heterogeneous
memory for some time; his focus at the moment is on memory that is not
necessarily directly accessible by the CPU and which may not be cache
coherent.  Device drivers tend to want complete control over such memory;
pinning of pages by the CPU cannot generally be supported.
<p>
There has been a lot of talk about supporting memory types using the NUMA
abstraction, Glisse said, but that approach has some limitations.
Applications might start using device memory without understanding its
limitations, leading to data corruption or other unfortunate consequences.
His solution is to make the use of this memory something that applications
opt into explicitly, specifying the type of memory they are looking for.
<p>
Applications would do this with the new <tt>hbind()</tt> system call, which
was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181203233509.20671-1-jglisse@redhat.com/">posted
for review</a> several months ago.  This call exists to unify access to
different types of device memory; that access is generally available now,
but it requires a different <tt>ioctl()</tt> call for each device type.
Rather than forcing applications to support a range of calls, Glisse would

<a href="/Articles/787854/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/JérômeGlisse2-sm.jpg" alt="[Jérôme Glisse]"
title="Jérôme Glisse" class="rthumb"></a>

like to provide a single call that works for everything.  <tt>hbind()</tt>
would be like <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><tt>mbind()</tt></a>,
but it would work with device memory as well as ordinary, CPU-attached
memory.
<p>
There were a lot of questions about just what the semantics of this new
system call would be; Glisse described it as a request to migrate content
to device memory while keeping it accessible.  Michal Hocko said that he
would rather have a better description of the semantics than the
implementation details Glisse was giving.  He asked what would happen if
multiple users request more memory than a device can provide; how can one
guarantee access for the most important process?  Glisse replied that the
answer would be device-specific.  Hocko complained that the interface is
insufficiently defined in general; if he has to maintain that API forever,
he said, he wants specifics.
<p>
Dave Hansen said that it looked like Glisse is creating a parallel
interface to the system's NUMA functionality; is NUMA really not good
enough to solve this problem?  Aneesh Kumar said, though, that it wasn't
possible to allow the kernel to manage this memory, since things that the
kernel wants to do (page pinning, for example) cannot be supported.  In the
end, though, Hansen replied, users want to allocate this memory with
<tt>malloc()</tt>, which ends up involving the kernel anyway.
<p>
Glisse talked briefly about how applications would discover which device
memory is available on a system.  There would be a new directory called
<tt>/sys/devices/system/hmemory</tt>, with one entry per resource.  Each
entry would give the size of the memory region, a link to the device, and
describe any special properties that the memory has.
<p>
In the last minutes of the session, Gorman observed that <tt>hbind()</tt>
looks like a combination of the existing <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap()</a></tt> and
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><tt>set_mempolicy()</tt></a>
system calls; perhaps applications should just use those instead.  Hansen
added that there will be NUMA nodes for devices providing memory to the
system, on x86 systems at least.  The new interface essentially makes those
NUMA nodes go away, which is suboptimal.  Glisse responded that he wants to
provide access to memory that is noncoherent or not directly accessible to
the CPU; NUMA can't handle either of those.
<p>
Gorman then suggested that <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/move_pages.2.html"><tt>move_pages()</tt></a>
could be used to place data in the more exotic types of memory; Glisse said
that there is no NUMA node to use for that purpose, but the developers
pointed out that one could always be added.  Or, perhaps,
<tt>move_pages()</tt> could grow a new flag to indicate that a device ID is
being specified rather than a NUMA node.  The final conclusion seemed to be
that the <tt>move_pages()</tt> option should be investigated further.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

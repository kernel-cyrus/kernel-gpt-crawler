<h1>Priority inheritance in the kernel</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 3, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Imagine a system with two processes running, one at high priority and the
other at a much lower priority.  These processes share resources which are
protected by locks.  At some point, the low-priority process manages to run
and obtains a lock for one of those resources.  If the high-priority
process then attempts to obtain the same lock, it will have to wait.
Essentially, the low-priority process has trumped the high-priority
process, at least for as long as it holds the contended lock.

<p>
Now imagine a third process, one which uses a lot of processor time, and
which has a priority between the other two.  If that process starts to
crank, it will push the low-priority process out of the CPU indefinitely.
As a result, the third process can keep the highest-priority process out of
the CPU indefinitely.  
<p>

This situation, called "priority inversion," tends to be followed by system
failure, upset users, and unemployed engineers.  There are a number of
approaches to avoiding priority inversion, including lockless designs,
carefully thought-out locking scenarios, and a technique known as priority
inheritance.  The priority inheritance method is simple in concept: when a
process holds a lock, it should run at (at least) the priority of the
highest-priority process waiting for the lock.  When a lock is taken by a
low-priority process, the priority of that process might need to be boosted
until the lock is released.
<p>

There are a number of approaches to priority inheritance.  In effect, the
kernel performs a very simple form of it by not allowing kernel code to be
preempted while holding a spinlock.  In some systems, each lock has a
priority associated with it; whenever a process takes a lock, its priority
is raised to the lock's priority.  In others, a high-priority process will
have its priority "inherited" by another process which holds a needed
lock.  Most priority inheritance schemes have shown a tendency to
complicate and slow down the locking code, and they can be used to paper
over poor application designs.  So they are unpopular in many circles.
Linus was <a href="/Articles/178258/">reasonably clear</a> about how he
felt on the subject last December:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	"Friends don't let friends use priority inheritance".
	<p>
	Just don't do it. If you really need it, your system is broken
	anyway.
</div>
<p>
Faced with this sort of opposition, many developers would quietly shelve
their priority inheritance designs and go back to working on accounting
code. 
The kernel development community, however,  happens to have a member who has a
track record of getting code merged in spite of this sort of objection:
Ingo Molnar.  History may well repeat itself, as Ingo (working with Thomas
Gleixner) has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/177111/">a priority-inheriting futex
implementation</a> with a request that it be merged into the mainline.
This approach, says Ingo, provides a useful functionality to user space (it
is not meant to provide priority-inheriting kernel mutual exclusion
primitives) while avoiding the pitfalls which have hit other
implementations.
<p>

The PI-futex patch adds a couple of new operations to the <tt>futex()</tt>
system call: <tt>FUTEX_LOCK_PI</tt> and <tt>FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI</tt>.  In the
uncontended case, a PI-futex can be taken without involving the kernel at
all, just like an ordinary futex.  When there is contention, instead, the
<tt>FUTEX_LOCK_PI</tt> operation is requested from the kernel.  The
requesting process is put into a special queue, and, if necessary, that
process lends its priority to the process actually holding the contended
futex.  The priority inheritance is chained, so that, if the holding process
is blocked on a second futex, the boosted priority will propagate to the
holder of that second futex.  As soon as a futex is released, any
associated priority boost is removed.
<p>

As with regular futexes, the kernel only needs to know about a PI-futex
while it is being contended.  So the number of futexes in the system can
become quite large without serious overhead on the kernel side.
<p>

Within the kernel, the PI-futex type is implemented by way of a new
primitive called an <tt>rt_mutex</tt>.  The <tt>rt_mutex</tt> is
superficially similar to regular mutexes, with the addition of the priority
inheritance capability.  They are, however, an entirely different type,
with no code shared with the mutex implementation.  The API will be
familiar to mutex users, however; in brief, it is:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/rtmutex.h&gt;

    void rt_mutex_init(struct rt_mutex *lock);
    void rt_mutex_destroy(struct rt_mutex *lock);

    void rt_mutex_lock(struct rt_mutex *lock);
    int rt_mutex_lock_interruptible(struct rt_mutex *lock, 
                                    int detect_deadlock);
    int rt_mutex_timed_lock(struct rt_mutex *lock,
                            struct hrtimer_sleeper *timeout,
			    int detect_deadlock);
    int rt_mutex_trylock(struct rt_mutex *lock);
    void rt_mutex_unlock(struct rt_mutex *lock);
    int rt_mutex_is_locked(struct rt_mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>

The alert reader may have noticed that this looks much like the realtime
mutex type found in the realtime preemption patch.  Ingo once said that the
realtime patches would slowly trickle into the mainline, and that is what
appears to be happening here.  With this patch set, the PI-futex code is
the only user of the new <tt>rt_mutex</tt> type, but that could certainly
change over time.
<p>
The PI-futex patch also includes a new, priority-sorted list type which
could find users elsewhere in the kernel.
<p>

There has been relatively little discussion of this patch so far; it has
been included in recent -mm trees.  It is too late for 2.6.17, but, if no
real opposition develops, the PI-futex code might just find its way into a
subsequent kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
This is generally because Ingo writes sane patches and doesn't irritate people needlessly.  "Plays well with others."  His process with the realtime patches especially has been very open and release-early-and-often, he seems to work with anyone who has a problem in the patch, he gives good advice and accepts help graciously.<br>
<p>
And, this stuff is coming from a patch people actually use, and that meets a defined need.  It isn't "Oh, I think I'll introduce PI into the kernel today."  Makes it easier to ack the patches that come from it.<br>
<p>
In short, it's hard not to like him, and it's hard to fault his patches.<br>

      But it doesn't support priority inversion, it supports code that could /otherwise/ result in priority inversion. I don't think removing the change of something occuring quite constitutes as "supporting" :-p<br>

The Mars Pathfinder had problems due to priority inversion</a>.
Frankly, it seems like a good idea to include support for priority
inversion in the kernel.  It's very hard to be SURE that priority inversion can't happen, and in some circumstances if the problem occurs you are in deep trouble.  At the least, support for them in user space sounds like a good thing.

Hmmm.. I'm sure that's not what you really meant, eh? I'd quite prefer priority inversion avoided, using priority inheritance... ;p<br>

      <p>The posting uses the word "support," which can mean lots of different things.  To some, "support for priority inversion" would mean code that effects priority version.  For others, it means code that recognizes and/or handles priority inversion.
<p>
I always encourage people to avoid the term "support" altogether, because there is always a plainer, more informative word you can use.  In this case, I would say "handling of priority inversion" or "priority inheritance function."
<p>Remember that support <em>really</em> means to hold up or assist, and priority inversion doesn't require any support; it does fine all by itself.

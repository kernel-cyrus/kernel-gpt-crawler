<h1>A new LLVM CFI implementation</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 17, 2022</br>
           </div>
Some kernel features last longer than others.  Support for forward-edge
control-flow integrity (CFI) for kernels compiled with LLVM was added to the 5.13
kernel, but now there is already a replacement knocking on the door.
Control-flow integrity will remain, but the new implementation will be
significantly different — and seemingly better in a number of ways.
<p>
The kernel makes extensive use of indirect function calls; they are at the
heart of its internal object model.  Every one of those calls is a
potential entry point for an attacker; if the target of the call can be
somehow changed to an address of the attacker's choosing, the game is
usually over.  Forward-edge CFI works to thwart such
attacks by ensuring that every indirect function call sends control to a
code location that was actually intended to be a target of that call.
Specifically, an
indirect function call should only go to a known function entry point, and the
prototype of the function should match what is expected at the call site.
<p>
The CFI implementation merged for 5.13 works by creating "jump tables"
containing all of the legitimate targets of indirect function calls in the
kernel; there is one jump table for each observed function prototype.
Actual indirect calls are replaced with a jump-table lookup to ensure that
the intended target meets the criteria; the target should be found in the
jump table corresponding to the intended function prototype.
If that test fails, a kernel panic results.
See <a href="/Articles/856514">this article</a> for a more detailed
description of how this mechanism works.
<p>
That implementation of CFI does the job, but it has a few disadvantages as
well.  Creating the jump tables requires a view of the full kernel binary;
in practice, it requires that <a href="/Articles/744507/">link-time
optimization</a> be used to build the kernel, which is a slow and sometimes
tricky process.  The replacement of
function-pointer variables with jump-table entries also means that those
variables cannot be compared against the address of a specific function,
which is something that kernel code needs to do on occasion.
It would be nicer to have a CFI implementation that doesn't impose problems
of this sort.

</blockquote>
<p>
That implementation would appear to exist in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220610233513.1798771-1-samitolvanen@google.com/">this
patch set</a> from Sami Tolvanen.  It depends on <a
href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D119296">a new Clang compiler option</a>
(<tt>-fsanitize=kcfi</tt>), which has not yet landed in the LLVM mainline.
This CFI mechanism, which is "<q>intended to be used in low-level code,
such as operating system kernels</q>", avoids the above-mentioned problems
at the cost of a couple of other tradeoffs, notably that it cannot work
with execute-only memory (read access is always required).
<p>
When code is compiled with <tt>-fsanitize=kcfi</tt>, the entry point to
each function is preceded by a 32-bit value representing the prototype of
that function.  This value is (part of) a hash calculated from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">C++
mangled name</a> for the function and its arguments.  On x86 systems, this
hash is placed into a 
simple <tt>MOV</tt> instruction and surrounded by <tt>INT3</tt>
instructions; this is meant to prevent the hash itself from becoming a
useful gadget for attackers.  When an indirect call is made, extra code is
emitted to fetch and check this hash value prior to emitting the call
itself; if the hash does not match what
was expected, a trap (which will be turned into a kernel oops) results.  The
checking of the hash is why execute-only memory cannot be supported: it
must be possible to read the hash value from the executable code.
<p>
For the most part, this mechanism just works without the need for much
change in the kernel code itself — at least, not beyond the changes that
were already required for the previous CFI implementation.  There is,
however, the problem of functions written in assembly, which will need to
have the necessary preamble generated by some other means.  Generating the
requisite hash value for each indirectly called assembly function could be
a tiresome task; fortunately, the compiler provides some help.  Whenever it
sees (in C code) the address of a function being taken (as in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/media/platform/marvell/mcam-core.c#L1654">this
example</a>):
<p>
<pre>
    static const struct v4l2_file_operations mcam_v4l_fops = {
	.open = mcam_v4l_open,
	/* ... */
    };
</pre>
<p>
it will generate a corresponding symbol defined as the resulting hash
value; in this case, the symbol would be
<tt>__kcfi_typeid_mcam_v4l_open</tt>.  The existence of these symbols means
that the preambles for assembly functions can be generated automatically
via <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220610233513.1798771-7-samitolvanen@google.com/">some
tweaks</a> to the macros already used to define those functions.
<p>
This patch series is currently in its third version, and it would appear
that all of the substantive concerns have been addressed.  It is, in other
words, looking ready to be merged into the mainline.  There is only one
remaining obstacle to overcome: kernel developers will be reluctant to
merge this feature until it is actually supported in the LLVM Clang
compiler.  Assuming that happens in the near future, it should not be too
long until the kernel acquires an upgraded CFI implementation for the arm64
and x86 architectures.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It looks like this new CFI flavor essentially only checks if the called function has the expected number of arguments and each argument has the expected type - the called function name will not get verified.<br>
<p>
The function return value type isn&#x27;t a part of its C++ mangled name so I guess this isn&#x27;t checked either.<br>

Yes, this is to be expected as it is only designed to protect function pointers from being overwritten with completely arbitrary addresses. Only being able to call something that is actually intended to be a target of a function pointer is much less useful than, say, being able to call into the middle of a function that changes you uid. Since function pointers are used when you want to be able to change what function is called at runtime, checking the name would not make a lot of sense.<br>

I assume having a hash table of allowed call targets could work here (it would be incompatible with out-of-tree kernel modules, however).<br>

But this sounds a bit like the previous CFI design that this new implementation seeks to replace.<br>

I don&#x27;t quite understand your analogy here, the article says:<br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; When an indirect call is made, extra code is emitted to fetch and check this hash value prior to emitting the call itself</font><br>
<p>
So the checking happens prior to the actual call: in the caller, not in the callee.<br>

I was perhaps overly eager to make an INTERCAL reference.<br>
<p>
But I wasn&#x27;t referring to the implementation; rather the concept is that the function declares who can call it. That&#x27;s done by type here, but could also be done by saying &quot;I am an implementation of get_block_t&quot;<br>

The hash computation could presumably be changed pretty easily, since it only has to agree for all the files in a build of the kernel. Once the enforcement mechanism based on hashes is stable, the hash calculation should be easy enough to make more restrictive. Probably the ideal choice would be to hash the name of the typedef used to declare the function pointer, but then you need to change the code to annotate the functions with this typedef name. Getting the compiler to use this information for something useful is probably a necessary first step in getting people to make this kind of code change, so you want to start with using the information that is already available to do something that&#x27;s good but could be improved.<br>

      I don't quite understand what you are asking for here. The name of the called function isn't known at compile time, that's why it's an indirect call. So what name would you check against?

<p>
I think that the set of functions implementing particular callback in the kernel should be known at compile time, either via manual annotations (as willy has suggested above) or maybe even automatically by a sufficiently smart compiler.<br>
<p>
This probably would be incompatible with out-of-tree kernel modules, however.<br>

You can do that now. Just declare your functions as taking an extra (unused) argument of type struct { char[0]; char[0]; ...} with a different number of empty arrays for each possible callback. They have zero size and even at O0, no code should be emitted for them, but they still change the signature of the function and (should!) therefore change the C++ name mangling. The problem is, you also need to actually pass an argument, and unlike C++, C doesn&#x27;t let you get away with just writing &quot;{}&quot; for that, so you probably need some sort of macro. It&#x27;s a shame the standard doesn&#x27;t let you write something like &quot;void&quot; for a zero-size argument.<br>

<p>Well… zero-sized arguments don't exist in standard C, they are <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html">GNU extension</a> which means you can try to supply the patch which will support what you want to Clang and GCC.</p>

<p>Once you left the standard it's kind of hard to expect to see such non-standard constructs supported in said standard, don't you think?</p>

I think the point was that the standard should have allowed zero-sized (void type) arguments, variables, and fields from the beginning, for symmetry with expressions and function return types, so it wouldn&#x27;t require a GNU extension. Likewise for empty structures and unions &amp; zero-length arrays (including array variables, not just fields).<br>
<p>
A keyword for the void constructor might be nice, but &quot;(void)0&quot; would serve well enough. This could be made into a standard VOID macro, like NULL for &quot;(void*)0&quot;.<br>

The standard does have empty struct members using 0-length bit fields which have been in the standard from the beginning.[1] They&#x27;re not quite empty as they&#x27;re intended to serve as markers instructing the compiler to shift subsequent bit fields to a new word. 0-length arrays actually work similarly--fundamentally they&#x27;re a mechanism for controlling alignment and can also introduce padding where there wouldn&#x27;t have been any in their absence. (In practice, though, they can only introduce tail padding--at the tail end of a preceding bit field, if any, for the former, or tail end of the struct for the latter.)  Empty bit fields seem a little more useful, though, as aside from being standard they can be (must be since C11) unnamed: `struct { int a:3; int:0; int b:1; };` is a valid definition. You can use them along with the GNU empty struct extension to get an empty type without any names: both `sizeof (struct { int:0; })` and `sizeof (struct { int:0; int:0; })` are valid and evaluate to 0 (tested clang 3.8 and GCC 9.4).<br>
<p>
Also, at least based on a straight-forwarding reading of the standard, sequentially declared 0-length bit fields should collapse (i.e. not unspecified or undefined behavior), so that they introduce only one word of padding at most, if any; and this is indeed the behavior I see from clang and GCC. And while maybe more susceptible to disagreement, the language of the standard does seem to specify that a 0-length bit field not succeeding another bit field should not introduce any padding. I see the same behaviors for 0-length arrays, but the GCC documentation seemed much more ambiguous on both points.[2]<br>
<p>
I am curious why I haven&#x27;t seen void (the true &quot;nothing&quot;) type semantics extended elsewhere in the grammar. Maybe 0-length bit and array fields were sufficient, if not ideal, for the most pressing scenarios. But perhaps the language (inclusive of extensions) is finally moving in a direction where the old hacks are insufficient, and void might see some more attention.<br>
<p>
[1] See $ 3.5.2.1 at <a href="http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.txt">http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.txt</a><br>
<p>
[2] Putting it all together after having double checked my assertions with the standard, it does seem that the only use for 0-length arrays has been almost entirely subsumed by flexible array members, except that the former make indexing notation easier (no offsetof verbiage). For anything else (mostly in relation to extensions, like 0-length structures), 0-length bit field notation seems sufficient. Maybe the situation is different with C++.<br>

      That is essentially what the existing implementation does - that's what the jump tables contain.  It requires link-time optimization to work, though, and I'm not sure what it buys over verification of the prototype.

Maybe they are thinking of the function pointers in C++ vtables, where you know not just the expected signature, but the name of the virtual method that is being overridden.  If you include that in the hash, you can prevent the attacker from replacing it with an unrelated function or method that happens to have the same signature.<br>
<p>
Of course, that doesn&#x27;t apply to C.  But it may be possible to get a similar effect with manual annotations of some sort...<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The replacement of function-pointer variables with jump-table entries also means that those variables cannot be compared against the address of a specific function, which is something that kernel code needs to do on occasion. </font><br>
<p>
Indeed, and for that reason it&#x27;s really beyond me how the current code could have been merged without an explicit &quot;depends on BROKEN&quot;. The series monkey-patched out some sanity checking WARN_ONs that used function pointer comparison, but there are places in the kernel that rely on function pointer comparison for correctness, and because this CFI code breaks the semantics of comparing function pointers, leads to crashes down the line. Which, of course, prevents an attacker from gaining control; the owner&#x27;s control and use of the machine is just collateral damage we have to accept in the name of s3kurity.<br>
<p>
Oh well, at least it&#x27;s getting replaced by something saner now.<br>

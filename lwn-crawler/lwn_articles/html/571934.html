<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2013/">2013 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
H. Peter Anvin and Miklos Szeredi kicked off the invitation-only day of the 2013
Kernel Summit with a question: where, exactly, does the boundary between
the kernel and user space lie?  And, in particular, when is it possible to
make an incompatible change to the kernel ABI with the understanding that
the actual, supported ABI is provided by user-space code that is closely
tied to the kernel?  The answer they got was clear but, perhaps, not
exactly what they wanted.
<p>
Peter started by saying that we have a clear "don't break user space"
policy.  For the most part, living up to that policy is relatively
straightforward; one avoids making incompatible changes to system calls and
things continue to work.  We are also getting better with other kernel
interfaces like sysfs and <tt>/proc</tt>.  But there was, he said, an

<a href="/Articles/572004/"><img

interesting corner case last year: the GRUB2 bootloader was making a habit
of looking at the kernel configuration files during installation for the
setup of its menus.  The restructuring of some internal kernel code broke
GRUB2.  At this point, Linus jumped
in to claim that the kernel's configuration files do <i>not</i> constitute
a part of the kernel's ABI.  When somebody does something that stupid, he
said, one really cannot blame the kernel.
<p>
Peter moved on to another problem, one he himself introduced some sixteen
years ago.  <a href="/Articles/494993/">The automounter ABI has issues</a>
such that it failed to work with a 
32-bit user space on a 64-bit kernel.  A new type of pipe had to be
introduced to fix this problem; it was, he said, an example of how far we
are willing to go to avoid breaking applications.
<p>
What about, he asked, cases where we need to shift to a new ABI altogether?
Changes to the pseudo terminal (pty) interface are needed to get ptys to
work from within containers; it's still not clear how to handle the master
device in such situations. The control group interface is in flux, and
there have been some disagreements with the systemd folks over who "owns"
the container hierarchy as a whole.  When it was suggested that systemd
"wants to take over" control groups, Linus was quick to state that no such
thing was going to happen.  James Bottomley jumped in to note that the
issue had been discussed and that a mutually acceptable solution was at
hand.
<p>
Another ABI issue is the current limitation, built into the Linux virtual
filesystem layer, that no single I/O operation can transfer more than 2GB
of data.  As systems and memory sizes get larger, that limit may eventually
hurt, he said, but Linus said that this limit would not be lifted.  We are,
he said, better than OS&nbsp;X, which causes overly large I/O requests to
fail outright; Linux, instead, just transfers the maximum allowed amount of
data. 
There are huge security implications to allowing larger I/O operations, to
the point that there is no excuse for removing the limit.  A whole lot of
potential problems will simply be avoided if filesystem code just never
sees 64-bit I/O request sizes.  And, he said, if you try to do a 4GB write,
"you're a moron."  Such requests will not be any faster, there is just no
reason to do it.
<p>
In general, Linus said, he is fundamentally opposed to doing anything that
might break user space; he was not sure why the topic was being discussed
at all.  The old issue of tracepoints came up, and Linus said that, if we
break something with a tracepoint change, that is a problem and we will fix
it.  Greg Kroah-Hartman pointed out that some subsystem maintainers —
himself and Al Viro, for example — are refusing to add tracepoints because
they are afraid of being committed to supporting them forever.  Others
thought that this policy was excessively cautious, noting that actual
problems with tracepoint ABI compatibility have been few and far between.
No-tracepoints policies, Ingo Molnar said, are simply not justified.
<p>
What about changes to <tt>printk()</tt> calls that break scripts that grep
through the system logs?  Linus answered that <tt>printk()</tt> is not
special, and that problems there will be fixed as well.  Masami Hiramatsu
suggested that the sort of string-oriented data found in the logs is
relatively easy to work with, and changes are easy to adapt to, but that
hints that, perhaps, users are just coping with problems there rather than
complaining about them.  It would be interesting to see what would happen if a
user were to actually complain about broken scripts resulting from a
<tt>printk()</tt> 
change.  Linus closed things off by complaining that the kernel developers
have spent far more time worrying about this problem than they ever have
dealing with actual issues.
<p>
Miklos stepped up to ask more specifically: where is the boundary that sets
the kernel ABI?  Some parts of the operating system live in the kernel,

<a href="/Articles/572009/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/MiklosSzeredi-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Miklos Szeredi]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>


while others can be found in libraries and the kernel.  Sometimes things
move; <tt>rename()</tt> was once in the C library, now it's a system call
provided by the kernel.  NFS servers have been found on both sides of the
divide, graphics drivers have been moving into the kernel, sound drivers
have moved in both directions, and filesystems can be found on both sides.
<p>
Miklos may have been hoping for some sort of discussion of whether the
interface between the kernel and some of these low-level components could
be considered to be internal and not part of the kernel's ABI, but things
didn't go in that direction.  Instead, the discussion wandered a bit,
covering whether parts of NetworkManager should be in the kernel (no, they
would just have to call out to user space for authentication and such),
drivers that require closed user-space components (still considered
unwelcome), and the implementation of protocols like MTP, which, evidently,
has more stuff in user space than should really be there.

Sometimes the messages you're sending out into the world are just wrong and stupid and you have to reformat, reword, clarify them.  Yes, someone could be depending upon the exact wording, but you either have to accept that your logs aren't an ABI, or you have to formalize some component of the messaging as rigid and leave the informative text as not being part of it.<br>

svn has an xml-output switch... I'm not sure the cure isn't worse than the disease, but it has saved my employer from having to rewrite code due to typo fixes and (more importantly) language localizations.  <br>

Not that I'm advocating xml in the kernel, but at the point people are trying to actually parse printk()s, abstract error symbols make some amount of sense.<br>

      <p>In our editor's summary, he <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/494993/">linked</a> the LWN article regarding the broken Autofs ABI.  I made a curt <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/495311/">comment</a> ranting that autofs and systemd need to work better together.  In view of how much I've learned since then about just how difficult system- and kernel-level programming can be, especially when supporting a plethora of architectures and user-spaces, I've realized just how selfish and short-sighted my original comment is.  I'm sorry for making that comment.</p>

<p>It is too easy to dismiss programming issues such as kernel &#8596; userspace ABI breakage, but time and again I see that the kernel devs always try to Do The Right Thing&trade;.</p>

Now for thinking about the question where it can lie and what it can or should signify, looking at the HURD might actually prove educational.
<p/>
Some problems might benefit from shifting the boundary a <em>lot</em>.

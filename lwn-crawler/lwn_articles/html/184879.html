<h1>Tainting from user space</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted May 24, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel has long used "tainting" as a way of noting that something has
happened which may affect the stability of the system.  Should a kernel
oops occur, the resulting kernel trace includes information on the kernel's
taint status.  This information can then be used by developers to ask hard
questions about what was really going on.  The taint flag was originally
added to flag the use of binary-only kernel modules, but its use has grown
since then.  Events which will taint a current kernel include the forced
removal of a module, loading a module without proper (or matching) version
information, or running an SMP kernel with processors not designed for
SMP operation.  Machine check exceptions and certain kinds of memory
management errors will also result in a tainted kernel.
<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184557/">A recent patch by Ted Ts'o</a>
expands the taint concept in an interesting way.  It adds a new file
(<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/tainted</tt>); should user space write to that file,
the kernel will be marked tainted with the new "<tt>U</tt>" flag.  The
idea, says Ted, is to flag "<q>when userspace is potentially doing
something naughty that might compromise the kernel.</q>"  It took a few
more questions before <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184783/">the real
truth of the matter</a> came out:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The problem is that the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ)
	**requires** that the JVM provide class functions which provide
	direct access to physical memory; all physical memory.  In fact,
	the RTSJ compliance test explicitly checks for this; it requires
	that you give the compliance test the address of a few hundred megs
	of physical memory for the test.  The absolutely hilarious bit
	about all of this is that the same customer who wants RTSJ
	compliance because of federal procurement regulations is also
	interested in using SELinux.
</div>
<p>
The idea of using SELinux on a system where Java code is free to mess
around with physical memory does involve a fair amount of cognitive
dissonance.  But The Customer Is Always Right, so Ted is making this work.
<a href="/Articles/184881/">Not entirely willingly</a>, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In fact, I was so unhappy about being forced by the RTSJ
	specification to do this insane thing that I wanted to make sure
	that if it were ever used, it would set a TAINT flag to warn people
	that just about anything unsane could have happened, and the
	system's stability was at the mercy of the competence of Java
	application programmers.
</div>
<p>
Nobody has stepped forward to say that the kernel should not be tainted in
such a situation.  Instead, one might almost be able to merge a patch
causing the kernel to emit scary horror-movie sounds as well.  
<p>
There appears to be general agreement that this patch makes sense;
certainly there are plenty of situations where user-space actions might
affect the stability of the system.  There was one request for a log
message to be stored with the user-space taint flag so that the reason for
its presence would be more clear later on.  A concern was also raised that
some distributions were using the "<tt>U</tt>" flag for other reasons (to
flag the presence of "unsupported" modules), though it is not clear that
this is actually happening.  Collisions over the use of taint flags could
indeed create confusion, so Dave Jones has suggested that any taint flags
used in out-of-tree code should at least be documented with a comment in
the mainline kernel.  Whether any such flags exist remains to be seen,
however.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I know that SUSE has used a couple of extra taint flags, 'U' and maybe 'X'.  These have been in there since at least SuSE Linux 9.x.<br>

      Yes, I've seen this.  Loading a (GPLed) kernel module, that I'd written, on a SUSE 9.3 box produced a "kernel tainted" message in the system logs, which confused me at first.  If you Google for this, you'll see that this is a bit of a FAQ.  Here's a link to the SUSE docs which describe the different flags:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.suse.de/~agruen/kernel-doc/">http://www.suse.de/~agruen/kernel-doc/</a><br>
<p>
They even use the same sysfs path (/proc/sys/kernel/tainted) that Ted's patch does, apparently.<br>

      I think tainting is a one-way street and that a kernel can't be untainted. The article doesn't mention that writing '0' to the sysfs file untaints it.<br>

      What would be the purpose of doing this, though?  The only thing it would allow is wasting a little kernel developer time when a bug report is submitted.  Whoopee.<br>
<p>
Second, setting that flag by poking around memory probably isn't that easy.  Where in memory is the flag, exactly?  With how every kernel release (and almost every kernel compilation) can end up with pretty drastically different memory layouts, it's not possible to just write some data to some specific memory location.  You would have to write an awful lot of very complex code just to figure out where to write the change.  And if the code isn't absolutely right, you probably just end up crashing the machine.  (And, hence, if you do a bug report of the oops message, it shows developers the kernel was tainted.)<br>

Sounds like a great idea for Amarok hackers! (Assuming the value can be read from user space too:-)

      How does a user mode library obtain access to raw memory<br>
without the kernel granting that access?<br>
<p>
If the kernel has granted such access, it should view <br>
itself as tainted whether or not the user-mode code<br>
voluntarily flags itself that way.<br>
<p>
As to the core problem, the Linux kernel realy isn't<br>
able to comply because even it does not KNOW that it<br>
has access to true physical memory -- it could itself<br>
be virtualized. So what's the point?<br>

      Exactly the same point I was going to make.

On the rare occasions when I've accessed physical memory from user space, I've done it by mmap()ing /dev/mem.  Arguably any user process that mmap()s /dev/mem or /dev/kmem with write permission should result in a tainted flag, without any explicit request for that flag by the user process.

      Except that mmaping /dev/mem with r/w permissions is exactly what every X process does... So a lot of kernels out there would be "tainted" in a way.<br>

      That's what I thought too, and certainly it's how it used to be done, but by now if it hasn't moved to mmap()ing a specific PCI region file, it certainly should.
<p>
Back around 1999 I proposed that /proc/pci should have mmap()able files for each PCI memory region configured for a device.  It looks like by 2003 this had been implemented, based on a
<a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0310.3/0020.html"> post by David Miller to the LKML on 24-oct-2003</a>.
<p>
When I proposed that idea, it met a lot of resistance from people that thought it would somehow open a security hole.  They didn't see that in fact it allowed BETTER control over security by using filesystem permissions to restrict an X server to only accessing the video card, and not being able to scribble over arbitrary memory.  These days, with udev, it should even be possible to make the video card PCI regions owned by a specific user (e.g., "xserver"), and not give the X server root permissions at all.

<p>
The kernel doesn't necessarily know that some module is allowing user-space     access to physical memory. A module can allocate whatever number of physical pages it wants and allow it to be mmap()ed using a pseudo-device. (BTW, this is what the rmem module in Ted's patch is doing). So it is upto the module to decide whether such access taints the kernel or not. <br>
<p>
I think drivers like open-ib (Infiniband) and open-rdma have a legitimate need for such access. So such drivers would not want to taint the kernel.<br>
<p>
Note that the patch taints the kernel from within the module. The /proc file is only an additional feature. To quote Ted:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Technically speaking, we don't need to be able to set it</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; via the /proc interface, but it seems like a useful thing</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; that could be useful for other applications.</font><br>

      Access to a specific set of physical pages, as is required<br>
for RDMA and graphics cards, is not what I would call "raw<br>
access". It is resource allocation. The fact that a user<br>
can damage a resource that has been allocated to it does<br>
not make the kernel itself suspect.<br>
<p>
However, a kernel that grants a user process permission<br>
to write to *any* memory (including the kernel) doesn't<br>
have much of a leg to stand on in making distinctions<br>
between "tainted" code and "non-tainted" code. As soon<br>
as the permission to update the memory where the kernel's<br>
code is stored is granted to a user process, that user<br>
process effectively becomes part of the kernel.<br>

      Why does RTSJ need access to <I>all</I> of physical memory?  That's positiviely absurd.  I <I>can</I> seen needing access to the physical memory the JVM is allowed to use, and Linux staying out of that memory.  It's not much different than allocating it through normal means and then mlock()'ing it, though.

      <p>Surely the RTSJ specification would require whole-memory access for <b><i>any operating system</i></b> running the JVM, wouldn't it?  Would someone please tell me this requirement isn't just for Linux, but also for MacOS, Microsoft Windows, Solaris, or BSD? (Assuming that the target computer would be running a JVM, of course.)</p>

<p>It seems that Java's absurdity would be moreeasily noticed once all computer OS vendors asked to implement RTSJ compliance also had to implement unfettered access to all physical memory.  And besides, what do they need all that memory for?</p>

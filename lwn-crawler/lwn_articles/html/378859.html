           </div>
As a normal rule of business, the kernel tries to avoid using more system
resources than are absolutely necessary; system time is better spent
running user-space programs.  So Tejun Heo's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/377720/">cpuhog patch</a> may come across as
a little surprising; it creates a mechanism by which the kernel can
monopolize one or more CPUs with high-priority processes doing nothing.
But there is a good reason behind this patch set; it should even improve
performance in some situations.
<p>
Suppose you wanted to take over one or more CPUs on the system.  The first
step is to establish a hog function:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/cpuhog.h&gt;

    typedef int (*cpuhog_fn_t)(void *arg);
</pre>
<p>

When hog time comes, this function will be called at the highest possible
priority.  If the intent is truly to hog the CPU, the function should
probably spin in a tight loop.  But one should take care to ensure that
this loop will end at some point; one does not normally want to take the
CPU out of commission permanently.
<p>
The monopolization of processors is done with any of:
<p>
<pre>
    int hog_one_cpu(unsigned int cpu, cpuhog_fn_t fn, void *arg);
    void hog_one_cpu_nowait(unsigned int cpu, cpuhog_fn_t fn, void *arg,
			    struct cpuhog_work *work_buf);
    int hog_cpus(const struct cpumask *cpumask, cpuhog_fn_t fn, void *arg);
    int try_hog_cpus(const struct cpumask *cpumask, cpuhog_fn_t fn, void *arg);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>hog_one_cpu()</tt> will cause the given <tt>fn()</tt> to be
run on <tt>cpu</tt> in full hog mode; the calling process will wait until
<tt>fn()</tt> returns; at which point the return value from <tt>fn()</tt>
will be passed back.  Should there be other useful work to do (on a
different CPU, one assumes), <tt>hog_one_cpu_nowait()</tt> can be called
instead; it will return immediately, while <tt>fn()</tt> may still be
running.  The <tt>work_buf</tt> structure must be allocated by the caller
and be unused, but the caller need not worry about it beyond that.
<p>
Sometimes, total control over one CPU is not enough; in that case,
<tt>hog_cpus()</tt> can be called to run <tt>fn()</tt> simultaneously on
all CPUs indicated by <tt>cpumask</tt>.  The <tt>try_hog_cpus()</tt>
variant is similar, but, unlike <tt>hog_cpus()</tt>, it will not wait if
somebody else got in and started hogging CPUs first.
<p>
So what might one use this mechanism for?  One possibility is
<tt>stop_machine()</tt>, which is called to ensure that absolutely nothing
of interest is happening anywhere in the system for a while.  Calls to
<tt>stop_machine()</tt> usually happen when fundamental changes are being
made to the system - examples include the insertion of dynamic probes,
loading of kernel modules, or the removal of CPUs.   It has always worked
in the same way as the CPU hog functions do - by running a high-priority
thread on each processor.   
<p>
The new <tt>stop_machine()</tt> implementation, naturally, uses
<tt>hog_cpus()</tt>.  Unlike the previous implementation, though (which
used workqueues), the new code takes advantage of the CPU hog threads which
already exist.  That eliminates <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/957726">a performance
bug</a> reported by Dimitri Sivanich, whereby the amount of time required
to boot a system would be doubled by the extra overhead of various
<tt>stop_machine()</tt> calls.
<p>
Another use for this facility is to force all CPUs to quickly go through
the scheduler; that can be useful if the system wants to force a transition
to a new read-copy-update grace period.  Formerly, this task was bundled
into the migration thread, which already runs on each CPU, in a bit of an
awkward way; now it's a straightforward CPU hog call.
<p>
The migration thread itself is also a user of the single-CPU hogging
function.  This thread comes into play when the system wants to migrate a
process which is running on a given CPU.  The first thing that needs to
happen is to force that process out of the CPU - a job for which the CPU
hog is well suited.  Once the hog has taken over the CPU, the
just-displaced process can be moved to its new home.
<p>
The end result is the removal of a fair amount of code, a cleaned-up
migration thread implementation, and improved performance in
<tt>stop_machine()</tt>.  
Some <a href="/Articles/378866/">concerns</a> were raised that passing a
blocking function as a CPU hog could create problems in some situations.
But blocking in a CPU hog seems like an inherently contradictory thing to
do; one assumes that the usual response will be "don't do that".  And, in fact, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/378968/">version&nbsp;2 of the patch</a>
disallows sleeping in hog functions.    Of
course, the "don't do that" response will also apply to most uses of CPU hogs in general;
taking over processors in the kernel is still considered to be an
antisocial thing to do most of the time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

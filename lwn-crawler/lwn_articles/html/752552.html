It is a good thing that strong coffee was served at the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit; full awareness was required from
the first session, in which Josef Bacik discussed some issues that have
arisen in the interaction between filesystems and the memory-management
subsystem.  Filesystems cache a lot of data from files, but also a lot of
metadata about those files.  It turns out, though, that management of the
cached metadata does not work as well as one might like.
<p>
In particular, Bacik said, he has been working on better tracking of dirty
metadata in memory.  This is a problem that every filesystem faces, and
each one has come up with its own solution.  Left unchecked, the amount of
dirty metadata in the system is limited only by the amount of memory
available â€” which can be problematic, given that the owner of the system
usually wants to use at least some of that memory for other purposes.  The
Btrfs filesystem uses a special inode to track and limit dirty metadata,
but that leads to "horrifying things" around the process of evicting that
metadata when the time comes.  Among other things, it doesn't support
sub-page-sized blocks.
<p>
The Btrfs developers would like to take an approach closer to what is done
in XFS, he said.  That approach works well, but still suffers from the
problem that the metadata cache can grow to fill all of memory.  To address
this problem, he's working on adding separate counters to track metadata

pages, with the idea that filesystems will get a writeback callback
from the memory-management subsystem
indicating the number of these pages that should be freed.  This callback
will come from <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/page-writeback.c#L1553"><tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt></a>,
which knows how much memory it needs to free and can pass that information
down to filesystem code.
<p>
Dave Chinner noted that memory accounting at this level is all based on
pages, which doesn't necessarily match the problem of tracking filesystem
metadata, which exists in many sizes from a fraction of a page to many
pages.  So 
tracking dirty metadata in terms of pages doesn't really solve the
problem.  Bacik responded that he has changed all of the counters to units
of bytes to address just this problem.  He asked the memory-management
developers in the room whether they objected to this change; nobody seemed
to.
<p>
Moving on, he said that <tt>balance_dirty_pages()</tt> has a global limit
of dirty memory that encompasses both data and metadata pages.  But, he
asserted, it is generally better to write out data pages than metadata
pages when memory must be freed, so Btrfs focuses on the data pages first.
Is that behavior good enough, he asked, or should there be separate limits
for data and metadata?
<p>
Johannes Weiner said that one limit should apply to both types, since the
system is committed to writing back all of the dirty data in the end.  Jan
Kara said, though, that there is a fundamental difference between writing
back data, which just has to be pushed out of the page cache, and metadata,
which must be written back via calls to shrinkers.  Bacik said that the
shrinker interface is a part of the problem, since it is not well
designed.  The Btrfs changes are going to put more pressure on the shrinker
interface, since there will be unknown amounts of data attached to each
object that might be written back.  There is, he said, a lot of memory
hidden in places where the memory-management subsystem has no idea how to
find it.
<p>
Rik van Riel said that, when a filesystem allocates memory, it expects the
memory-management code to be able to free up enough memory to satisfy the
request.  But, while allocations require pages, shrinkers work on smaller
objects.  A shrinker may free the amount of memory requested by the
memory-management code, but those objects can be scattered across memory
and the end result may be to free no pages at all.  As more memory is taken
up by filesystem caches, he admonished, the filesystem has to free those
caches or it will find its allocation requests failing.  Kara responded,
though, that fragmentation tends not to be a huge problem in this context,
since the objects involved are relatively large.
<p>
Chinner said that XFS does the majority of its metadata writeback by way of
shrinkers, but also all of its page-reclaim work.  The XFS cache structure
is too complicated to express in the page cache, so the page cache is not
used for this purpose.  So, for XFS, there are no problems resulting from
the shrinkers and the page cache not working together.  Bacik said, though,
that this results in XFS tending to write data randomly during reclaim,
which can lead to excessive latencies, so Facebook has had to patch that
feature out.  There needs to be a way to do XFS metadata writeback in
places where latency is expected.
<p>
Mike Snitzer suggested that "bufio", a shrinker-based mechanism used by the
device mapper
might be able to help here; it has recently been enhanced to handle objects with
sizes that are not a power of two.  Bacik said he'd looked at it, but he
thinks that maybe the shrinker interface is not the best one for this
problem.  Chinner said the solution could be a new type of shrinker; the
same mechanism could be used, but the accounting would be adapted to handle
the metadata issues.
<p>
Chris Mason said that Btrfs has a set of throttling hooks that slow down
allocations in places that are known to be safe; it is working well.  The
only caveat is that things fall apart if the <tt>kswapd</tt> thread starts
performing I/O.  In general, Weiner said, the entity that is issuing writes
is not the one that is performing allocations, so throttling writes is the
wrong way to address the problem.  There should be two separate throttling
points, one for writes and one for allocations; conflating the two has
caused a lot of problems.
<p>
Bacik closed the session by saying that he will do the work to add a new
shrinker interface with byte-based accounting for metadata.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

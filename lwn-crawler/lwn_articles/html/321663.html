           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 3, 2009</br>
           </div>
Felipe Balbi recently posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/321385/">a
driver called twl4030-pwrbutton</a>, which generates input events when
somebody hits a power button connected through a twl4030 i2c controller.
It is, in many ways, a standard driver; Felipe certainly did not expect to
see a long and acrimonious discussion result from its posting.  But that's
what ensued.  Over the course of this discussion, the participants were
able to outline some problems with how interrupts are handled on Linux
systems, along with a potential solution.
<p>
Things started when Andrew Morton questioned the following bit of code,
found in the driver's interrupt handler:
<p>
<pre>
    #ifdef CONFIG_LOCKDEP
	/* WORKAROUND for lockdep forcing IRQF_DISABLED on us, which
	 * we don't want and can't tolerate.  Although it might be
	 * friendlier not to borrow this thread context...
	 */
	local_irq_enable();
    #endif
</pre>
<p>
Workarounds of this variety do tend to catch the attention of diligent
reviewers.  Understanding this one requires just a bit of background.  
<p>
Back in the Good Old Days, the Linux kernel had "fast" and "slow" interrupt
handlers; the main difference between the two is that "fast" handlers ran
with further interrupts disabled, while "slow" handlers were run with
interrupts enabled.  Over time, the distinction between the two types has
faded; faster, smarter hardware and greater use of software interrupts and
tasklets have made the execution time of most well-written interrupt handlers
essentially irrelevant.  So most driver authors do not even think much
about whether they are writing a "fast" or a "slow" handler, even though
the distinction still exists.  Unless a driver passes the
<tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> flag when requesting its interrupt line, its
interrupt handler will be called with interrupts enabled.
<p>
"Lockdep" is the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/185666/">kernel lock
validator</a>, which, when enabled, creates a detailed model of how locks
are used in the kernel.  This model can be used to find potential deadlocks
and other problems.  <a href="/Articles/321670/">According to Ingo
Molnar</a>, lockdep has been quite effective:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You might also have noticed that over the past 2-3 years the term
	"hard lockup" in regression reports has gone down by about an order
	of magnitude - and much of that can be attributed to the lockdep
	coverage we have in place.
</div>
<p>
It turns out, though, that the lockdep developers made one significant,
simplifying assumption: all interrupt handlers were to be invoked with
interrupts disabled.  When lockdep is enabled, in fact, the generic
interrupt handling layer forces this condition, regardless of whether any
specific handler was registered with the <tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> flag.
Lockdep has worked this way for some time, and complaints have been
scarce.  But, as can be seen from the patch cited above, "scarce" is not
the same as "nonexistent."
<p>
Drivers for i2c-connected devices operate under a number of interesting
constraints, mostly forced by the fact that the i2c "bus" is, in reality, a
slow, two-wire serial interface.  So even "fast" operations like reading a
device register are, in fact, slow on i2c devices; they are slow enough
that the process involved should sleep while waiting for the result.  That
is a bit of a problem for i2c interrupt handlers, since they need to access
device registers, but they cannot sleep.
<p>
The result is that a number of i2c drivers have implemented what is, in
effect, a threaded interrupt handler mechanism.  The "real" interrupt
handler simply masks the interrupt and wakes up the thread, which then does
the real work of talking to the device.  In the case of the twl4030 driver,
this threaded implementation has been done in a relatively formal manner in
which the device interrupt handlers are invoked - from within a
special-purpose kernel thread - by way of the generic IRQ layer itself.
These threaded handlers do not expect to run with interrupts disabled -
indeed, they cannot run that way - but the generic IRQ code will, when
lockdep is enabled, turn off interrupts anyway.  That is why this patch
takes pains to turn them back on when lockdep is being used.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra's response to this discussion was to post <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/321386/">a patch forcing
<tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> for all drivers</a>.  His position is that no
interrupt handlers should be run with interrupts enabled.  Doing so invites
kernel stack overruns if too many nested interrupts come in; it also, he
says, encourages the notion that it's OK for interrupt handlers to be
slow.  Additionally, he says, drivers must already be able to run their
handlers with interrupts disabled, since another driver may disable
interrupts on a shared interrupt line.  So, he says, it makes no sense to
"fix" lockdep for handlers which want interrupts to be enabled; instead,
the always-disabled assumption built into lockdep should be made part of
the system as a whole.
<p>
The response to this patch was somewhat sympathetic, at least in a general
sense.  Making <tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> be the default situation makes sense
for most devices.  But there really are drivers which need their interrupt
handlers to run with
interrupts enabled; IDE drivers using programmed I/O are one example.  If
those
interrupt handlers are given exclusive control over the system, other
devices will see unacceptable latencies and start to fail operations or
drop data.  So any change of this nature must be done carefully, and it
must remain possible to run some handlers with interrupts enabled.
<p>
And, of course, forcing <tt>IRQF_DISABLED</tt> does nothing to fix the
twl4030 problem.
<p>
The real solution is to have general support for threaded interrupt
handlers.  The realtime preemption tree has supported threaded handlers for
quite some time; more recently, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/302043/">a
variant of the threaded handlers patch</a> was posted for mainline
consideration.  There are a lot of advantages to threaded handlers beyond
their applicability to the problems discussed here; threaded handlers can
improve latencies, allow interrupt handlers to be prioritized, and,
someday, perhaps allow the removal of software interrupts altogether.  So
it seems like there would be value in getting this code merged.
<p>
To that end, Thomas Gleixner has come back with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/320865/">a new version of the threaded
handlers patch</a>.  The API looks much like it did in the previous
posting, though it could change in response to <a
href="/Articles/321673/">some review comments</a> made this time around.
In essence, this infrastructure allows a driver to register a "quick
handler" to acknowledge (and mask) an interrupt; there would also be a
regular handler which could be called in either hard interrupt or process
context, depending on the quick handler's return value.  The API allows
drivers to continue to work unmodified, or they can be converted over to
threaded handlers.
<p>
David Brownell, the leading critic of lockdep's behavior and the idea of
disabling interrupts for all handlers, seems to agree that the threaded
interrupt handler infrastructure should be able to solve the i2c problem.
All threaded handlers will, by necessity, run with interrupts enabled, so
the primary difficulty goes away.  David would like to see some changes
made to better support the chaining of handlers that is typically needed in
such situations, but it's not clear how many changes are really needed.
<p>
In summary, threaded interrupt handlers seem likely to be the next
technology to be merged from the realtime preemption tree.  Just when that
might happen remains to be seen, though.  The request for some API changes
may well slow things down a bit; there were also requests for example
implementations of threaded handlers with more types of drivers.
Satisfying those requests quickly enough to allow the code to be reviewed
before the 2.6.30 merge window opens could be a bit of a challenge.  So
this code might just have to wait for one more development cycle; it would
be surprising if it were to take longer than that, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Unless a driver passes the IRQF_DISABLED flag when requesting its interrupt line, its interrupt handler will be called with interrupts enabled.</font><br>
<p>
A minor clarification:<br>
<p>
According to the Unreliable Guide To Locking, "it is architecture-specific whether all interrupts are disabled inside irq handlers themselves."<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/kernel-locking/x210.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/kerne...</a><br>
<p>
If you use IRQF_DISABLED, then your interrupt handler is guaranteed to be called with interrupts disabled.  If you don't use IRQF_DISABLED, then officially it is implementation-specific whether your interrupt handler is called with interrupts enabled or disabled.  It is apparent from the rest of the article that the current implementation-specific behavior depends on CONFIG_LOCKDEP.<br>
<p>
The important thing to remember when writing interrupt handlers is to use e.g. spin_lock_irqsave() instead of spin_lock_irq() (assuming you need a irq-disabling variant; see the Unreliable Guide To Locking for more details).  Then it will work with CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y and CONFIG_LOCKDEP=n and on a wide variety of kernel versions.<br>

Sorry for not understanding core logic<br>
<p>
What happens if lockdep is enabled, for interrupt handler which is implemented using threaded interrupt handler mechanism. If it disable then twl4030 problem remains there only right?<br>

<p>Also note that complaints about bugs introduced, or hidden, by lockdep forcibly setting IRQF_DISABLED have been disregarded.  There are examples of both problem categories ... and that's in addition to the workaround cited in that patch fragment.

<h1>Linux gets DCCP</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 30, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
For many years, the bulk of networking over IP has made use of just two
protocols: transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol
(UDP).  TCP offers a reliable, stream-oriented connection which works well
for a large variety of higher-level network protocols.  UDP, instead, makes
a best effort to move individual packets from one host to another, but
makes no promises regarding reliability or ordering.  Most higher-level
protocols are built upon TCP, but there are applications which are better
served by UDP.  These include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Protocols involving brief exchanges which will be slowed unacceptably 
     by TCP's connection overhead.  A classic example is the domain name
     system, which can often achieve a name lookup with a single packet in
     each direction.
<p>
<li> Protocols where timely delivery is more important than reliability.
     These include internet telephony, streaming media, and certain kinds
     of online games.  If the network drops a packet, TCP will stall the
     data flow until the sending side gets a successful retransmission
     through.  But a telephony application would rather keep the data
     flowing and just do without the missing packet.
</ul>
<p>

The second type of application listed above is an increasingly problematic
user of UDP.  Streaming applications are a growing portion of the total
traffic on the net, and they can be the cause of significant congestion.
Unlike TCP, however, UDP has no concept of congestion control.  In the
absence of any sort of connection information, there is no way to control
how any given application responds to network congestion.  Early versions
of TCP, lacking congestion control, brought about the virtual collapse of
the early Internet; some fear that the growth of UDP-based traffic could
lead to similar problems in the near future.

<p>
This concern has led to the creation of the datagram congestion control
protocol (DCCP), which is described by <a
href="http://www.icir.org/kohler/dcp/draft-ietf-dccp-spec-11.txt">this
draft RFC</a>.  Like UDP, DCCP is a datagram protocol.  It differs from
UDP, however, in that it includes a congestion control mechanism.
Eventually, it is hoped that users of high-bandwidth, datagram-oriented 
protocols will move over to DCCP as a way of getting better network
utilization while being fair to the net as a whole.  Further down the road,
after DCCP has proved itself, it would not be surprising to see backbone
network routers beginning to discriminate against high bandwidth UDP
users. 
<p>

DCCP is a connection-oriented protocol, requiring a three-packet handshake
before data can be transferred.  For this reason, it is unlikely to take
over from UDP in some areas, such as for DNS lookups.  (There is a
provision in the protocol for sending data with the connection initiation
packet, but implementations are not required to accept that data).
The higher-bandwidth
applications tend to use longer-lived connections, however, so they should
not even notice the connection setup overhead.
<p>

Actually, DCCP uses a concept known as "half connections."  A DCCP half
connection is a one-way, unreliable data pipe; most applications will create two half
connections to send data in both directions.  The two half connections can
be tied together to the point that, as with TCP, a data packet traveling in
one direction can carry an acknowledgment for data received from the
other.  In other respects, however, the two half connections are distinctly
separate from each other.
<p>

One way in which this separation can be seen is with congestion control.
TCP hides congestion control from user space entirely; it is handled by the
protocol, with the system administrator having some say over which
algorithms are used.  DCCP, on the other hand, recognizes that different
protocols will have different needs, and allows each half connection to
negotiate its own congestion control regime.  There are currently two
"congestion control ID profiles" (CCIDs) defined:
<p>
<ul>

<li> <a
     href="http://www.icir.org/kohler/dcp/draft-ietf-dccp-ccid2-10.txt">CCID
     2</a> uses an algorithm much like that used with TCP.  A congestion
     window is used which can vary rapidly depending on net conditions;
     this algorithm will be quick to take advantage of available bandwidth,
     and equally quick to slow things down when congestion is detected.
     (See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/128681/">this LWN article</a>
     for more information on how TCP congestion control works).
<p>
<li> <a
     href="http://www.icir.org/kohler/dcp/draft-ietf-dccp-ccid3-11.txt">CCID
     3</a>, called "TCP-friendly rate control" or TFRC, aims to avoid 
     quick changes in bandwidth use while remaining fair to other network
     users.  To this end, TFRC will respond more slowly to network events
     (such as dropped packets) but will, over time, converge to a bandwidth
     utilization similar to what TCP would choose.
</ul>
<p>

It is anticipated that applications which send steady streams of packets
(telephony and streaming media, for example) would elect to use TFRC
congestion control.  For this sort of application, keeping the data flowing
is more important than using every bit of bandwidth which is available at
the moment.  A control connection for an online game, instead, may be best
served by getting packets through as quickly as possible; applications
using this sort of connection may opt for the traditional TCP congestion
control mechanism.
<p>

DCCP has a number of other features aimed at minimization of overhead,
resistance to denial of service attacks, and more.  For the most part,
however, it can be seen as a form of UDP with explicit connections and
congestion control.  Porting UDP applications to DCCP should not be
particularly challenging - once platforms with DCCP support have been
deployed on the net.
<p>

To that end, one of the first things which was merged for 2.6.14 was
a DCCP implementation for Linux.  This work was done by Arnaldo Carvalho de
Melo, Ian McDonald, and others.  It is a significant bunch of code; beyond
the DCCP implementation itself, Arnaldo has done a lot of work to
generalize parts of the Linux network stack.  Much of the code which was
once useful only for TCP or UDP can now also be shared with DCCP.
<p>

For now, only CCID 3 (TFRC) has been implemented.  A CCID&nbsp;2
implementation, taking advantage of the TCP congestion control code, will
follow.  Even before that, however, the 2.6.14 kernel will be the first
widely deployed DCCP implementation on the net.  As such, it will likely
help to find some of the remaining glitches in the protocol and shape its
future evolution.  When DCCP hits the mainstream, one can be reasonably
well sure that the Linux implementation will be second to none.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      One other useful thing to note is that UDP doesn't work well behind firewalls often and DCCP is designed to do that.<br>

      What does DCCP look like to a legacy firewall.  You mention that it's <br>
designed to work well with firewalls, but how would I implement "allow" <br>
filters on a default-deny policy firewall, that only understands legacy <br>
protocols?  Would DCCP look to it like UDP?  IOW, is  it UDP with <br>
additional protocol info in what would be the UDP payload, thus recognized <br>
as UDP by legacy routers, or ???  If so, are there NAPT/masquerade <br>
implications similar to those with FTP and various VoIP and security <br>
protocols, or not? <br>
 <br>
I ask as I run one of those legacy things, one of the first-gen consumer <br>
level NAPT based broadband routers.  At some point, I'll likely replace it <br>
with a Linux based appliance and therefore benefit from community firmware <br>
projects, but my old Netgear rt314 has and continues to serve me well, so <br>
why mess with a good thing until I need to? <br>
 <br>
OTOH, it'll probably be another year or more before there's enough out <br>
there using DCCP in working deployments to be worrisome, particularly if <br>
MSWormOS support lags, and by then I may well have upgraded routers, but <br>
there'll still certainly be others who haven't. <br>

      I'm far from an expert, but having had a quick glance through the RFC, section 19 refers to the protocol number for DCCP being 33 (probably). UDP uses 17, so it will be seen as distinct and different from UDP. Take a quick glance at /etc/protocols to see how many there are (more than you probably realise, not that you use many of them day to day).<br>
<p>
Many firewalls support protocols other than the common TCP, UDP and ICMP, so theres no specific reason to think you won't be able to pass the data through. However, there may not be direct support for checking anything inside the packets headers, as the software would need to understand the protocol to extract this information.<br>

      What I meant by friendly to firewalls is that it is easy to track sessions (much easier than UDP where there are no direct sessions). That is one of the main reasons why media applications fall back to TCP...<br>
<p>
Of course you have to allow protocol 33 through as another poster says which on some equipment may cause problems.<br>

      This looks like a great improvement if we can use it to replace many of the TCP connections over wireless coms systems. One of the big hassles with TCP over wireless is TCPs slow start backoff mechanism. This leads to bandwidth oscillation and pretty horrible throughputs as TCP was never meant to handle the fast variations in the transmission path that radio introduces (ie lots of errors then really good all in a matter of seconds or milli seconds).CCID3 looks like the solution to this. <br>
<p>
There has already been unsuccessful attempts to get the IETF to vary TCPs slow start, maybe this time us wireless network operators will be able to implement something that performs much better for our customers.<br>

      DCCP isn't really meant to replace TCP.<br>
Take a look at TCP westwood, it's already in Linux and it makes a visable improvement overwireless links.<br>

      I never saw an article covering the reasoning and intended purpose of<br>
the SCTP (stream control transport protocol) (RFC2960).<br>
 <br>
Seeing this one on DCCP brought it to mind (since it's transport oriented,<br>
it sounds like it's role to TCP is analogous to DCCP's role compared to<br>
UDP).<br>
<p>
How would someone designing or implementing upper level protocols choose among these lower level ones?  Which existing applications and protocols might benefit by being fitted with options to use these lower level protocols when they are available?  Is there any standard way to negotiate (something along the lines of, try DCCP first then fall back to UDP)?<br>
<p>
This is an interesting article, but I want to see more :)<br>

"How does DCCP fit into the picture with SCTP?"
- SCTP could be used for instance for relaible transmission of signaling messages; whereas
DCCP - for transmission of bearer traffic.

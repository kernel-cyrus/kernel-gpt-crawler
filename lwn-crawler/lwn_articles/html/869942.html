<h1>A discussion on folios</h1>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>September 22, 2021</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2021-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
<p>
A few weeks ago, Matthew Wilcox might have guessed that his <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/contributions/976/">session</a>
at the <a href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/">2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a> would be focused rather differently.  But, as we <a
href="/Articles/868598/">reported earlier in September</a>, his <a
href="/Articles/849538/">folio</a> patch set ran into some, perhaps
unexpected, opposition and, ultimately, did not land in the mainline for
5.15.  Instead of discussing how to use folios as part
of the <a href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/sessions/111/">File
Systems microconference</a>, he led a discussion that was, at least in part, on the
path forward for them.
</p>

<p>
Wilcox began by noting that the folio patches had not been merged and that he
did not have clear direction from Linus Torvalds about what "needs to be
changed in order to make it acceptable to him".  That is a rather different
outcome than Wilcox had been hoping for, so the session was not going to be
about "what you need to do in order to enable your filesystems to go
faster" using folios. "That's not where we are."
</p>

</a>

<p>
Instead, though, it would be useful to talk about what filesystems need to
do in order to use larger pages in the page cache.  That will make
filesystem I/O more efficient, he said.  The best thing that developers
can do is to convert the filesystems that still use buffer heads to use
iomap for I/O, at
least for block-based filesystems.  Network filesystems should use David
Howells's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/netfs_library.html">netfs_lib</a>.
In both cases, those APIs will isolate the filesystems from most of the
work that Wilcox is doing, he said with a chuckle.
</p>

<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
Both of those APIs
insulate filesystems from the page cache; for example, they use
bytes for sizes, rather than pages.  Any filesystems that are working with the page
cache directly should look at using iomap or netfs_lib instead.   There are
artificial filesystems in the kernel, such as procfs, that do not deal with
the page cache at all; they fall outside of the discussion, since the focus
is on improving the page cache.
</p>

<p>
There are features that the buffer-head interface has, which iomap
currently lacks.  He has been talking with filesystem developers about
what needs to be added so that block-based filesystems can be converted to
use it.  There are features that iomap needs to in order to support both <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html">fscrypt</a>
and <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html">fs-verity</a>.
There are also some things that buffer heads can do 
in the I/O completion path, which are lacking in iomap, but there are "no
fundamental limitations", he said.  As always, though, there are limitations in
terms of developer time
</p>

<p>
Howells briefly described the work he is doing on making fscrypt work
with network filesystems and, in particular, to use folios in that work.
The idea is to put fscrypt and the page-cache handling code into a separate
library for network filesystems to use.  Currently, AFS and Ceph are using
it.  When a network filesystem receives encrypted data from the server, it
should not be storing it in the page cache unencrypted, but the code to
keep the data encrypted should not be replicated in the six different network
filesystems.   His work hit something of a wall when Torvalds did not
merge the folio patches, however.
</p>

<h4>Help wanted?</h4>

<a href="/Articles/870013/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2021/folio-discuss-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Discussion]" title="Discussion" width=300 height=205>
</a>

<p>
Josef Bacik asked how the filesystem developers could help Wilcox; he knows
that moving to iomap is part of that and that is ongoing work for Btrfs.
But he wondered if there were concrete steps the filesystem developers
could take to support Wilcox's efforts; "sometimes it is patch review, other
times it is design review, [...] what do you wish that we would do to help
you with all of this?"
</p>

<p>
Wilcox said that he did not think there was a lot to do on the filesystem
side.  He has "imposed on the XFS developers extensively" and they helped
work out some of his misconceptions.  They also helped ferret out problems
in his 
iomap changes; iomap was originally cut from the bottom of XFS and turned into
common code, he noted.
If there were going to be an effort to make buffer-head-using filesystems
handle larger pages, he would need similar help from the developers of one
of those filesystems, he said.  But the consensus seems to be that the
right path is to minimize the use of buffer heads, so that probably won't
be needed.  On the flipside,
though, Wilcox feels that he and the XFS developers owe the developers of
other filesystems some assistance in converting to iomap.  But he has
already seen some of that going on in the current efforts to convert direct
I/O for Btrfs to use iomap; it is all proceeding collaboratively.
</p>

<p>
Bacik said that he wasn't necessarily asking as a Btrfs developer, rather
as a kernel developer. These kinds of changes often come down to a single person pushing them
forward even though lots of others want the changes in the kernel; that one
person can sometimes have a rough time of it, he said.  
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o asked whether help with benchmarking would be useful.  Wilcox said
that he does not do much in the way of benchmark testing; he runs
xfstests many times a day, but is "not set up to do performance testing".
Both Ts'o and Bacik said they were set up to do that kind of testing, so if
Wilcox could point them at a Git tree, testing with and without folios
could be done regularly.
</p>

<p>
In something of a tangent, Ts'o noted that fscrypt and fs-verity were written
as libraries of a sort, so that they could be adopted more easily by other
filesystems.  But the combination of the two was not really made as
accessible. He has considered providing a sort of generic pipeline for
operations (e.g. decryption, verification, decompression) on filesystem
data coming from block devices or over the network that could be
combined in arbitrary ways.
</p>

<p>
He suggested to Howells that the next version
of the work he is doing on fscrypt support for network filesystems  provide
some kind of ability to 
stack operations of this sort.  Howells described what he has
been doing to make fscrypt work with some of the network filesystems using
larger pages.  That kind of work will be needed for ext4, Ts'o said, so
that it can move to using iomap as well.  They agreed to pick up that
discussion elsewhere when more of the appropriate people were present.
</p>

<h4>Folio future</h4>

<p>
Wilcox said that over the
previous few days he and 
Kent Overstreet had been talking about getting folios merged.  Overstreet
said that he thought progress had been made 
in the discussion on the linux-kernel mailing list over the last week or
so.  He said that the objections to folios turned out to not really apply
to the actual code that was proposed for&nbsp;5.15 in many cases.  In
particular, the patches did not really touch anonymous pages, which was an
area of contention, he said.
</p>

<p>
Overstreet suggested that Wilcox consult with Andrew Morton to see where
things stand because Overstreet felt that the objections were largely on where
folios were headed rather than what was actually posted.  Beyond that,
later in the day, Overstreet <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YUpNLtlbNwdjTko0@moria.home.lan/">posted</a> a
request to Torvalds to reconsider the original folios patch set for
inclusion.  But it turns
out that the situation is more complicated than Overstreet
perceived.  In particular,  Johannes Weiner, who disagrees strongly with
the direction of folios, at least on the memory-management side, had <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YUtHCle%2FgiwHvLN1@cmpxchg.org/">objections</a> to
the existing patch set and not just the direction they are headed in. 
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that someone had remarked to him that the memory-management
developers may not have actually looked closely at folios until the pull
request came in.  That may be due to a "cultural expectations that stuff in
MM takes forever and a day".  He wondered if there was a way to work with
those developers to determine what the review procedure is for patches of
this nature.  There may be a process question as to how the subsystem as a
whole makes decisions.  That would help everyone understand the ground
rules on how to get consensus; he does not believe there is a consensus
within the memory-management community on folios, at least yet.
</p>

<p>
There is no one who is really working on fixing "the <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> mess" at
this point, Overstreet said, which is perhaps part of the problem;
Wilcox's work is the closest the community has come to that. But the reason that this discussion
has been so contentious is that the state from different subsystems is all
jumbled together in  <tt>struct page</tt>, Overstreet said.  There is no
real overarching design for unwinding that.
</p>

<p>
He said that
everyone sees
the mess, but that each person sees a different aspect of that mess; folios
are cleaning up one part, but some are unhappy that their part
of it is not being cleaned up right away.  An overall plan that could show
the end goal and where each part gets cleaned up would go a long way toward
resolving these problems, he said.  That ended the session, but clearly the overall
discussion will continue.

Speaking as a performance oriented file system developer…. I am so desperate to get some part of this stuff in 😂. Just to get started towards larger pages and the many other batching (etc) things that can make the page cache so much better.<br>
<p>
Some of the user space object stores are starting to do some really neat stuff with larger pages and it would really help us in the kernel to keep up.<br>

I&#x27;ve not looked over the folio or MM code, but it sounds kind of like there is a push to get filesystems to support different/larger page size?<br>
As someone who regularly uses a POWER9 with 64K pages, that is an exciting prospect.<br>
<p>
I also think breaking any expectations of homogeneous 4K pages would be beneficial to the overall code quality.<br>

You have it in a nutshell.<br>
<p>
One thing that may intrigue you is the possibility of using 64k TLB entries on a kernel built with 4k page size. That will cut down on the amount of memory wasted caching small files.<br>
<p>
We&#x27;re a ways off being able to do that; there&#x27;s no infrastructure in place to allow architectures to do that, but PPC and ARM are on my list as architectures of interest.<br>

      A coworker and I at Wind River designed and implemented a revision of the VxWorks MMU manager back around 2005  to make use of the TLB support for larger order pages in PowerPC 440GP, E500, MIPS and ARM - which had software managed TLBs - the main point having one MMU library that worked across multiple architectures, with plugins to adapt it to the capability of different CPUs and architectures and dynamically handle support for different TLB page sizes. If there were larger order page sizes than 4kbytes supported by the TLB caches (for example PPC440 can do 16k, 64k, 256k, 1M, 4M, 16M, etc.), then it can use them with only a little modification and setup - I wrote code to manage the larger order page sizes. This greatly reduced TLB misses for large dynamically loaded text regions and large memory mapped peripheral devices. It made memory mapped text with less severe performance degradation everywhere, especially on small MIPS 4k or PowerPC 405GP processors with meager TLB slots but available large order page sizes. I remember talking about this strategy at some length with Rik Van Riel back at Ottawa Linux Symposium around that time, when I started working on WRLinux full time. Much easier to implement a memory manager for a simple RTOS like VxWorks than for all the various workloads of Linux, but I'm glad to see related work starting to happen now. Appreciating your effort, Matthew.

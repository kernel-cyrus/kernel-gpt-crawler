<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 10, 2018</br>
           </div>
The kernel's CPU scheduler must, as its primary task, determine which
process should be executing in each of a system's processors at any given
time.  Making an optimal decision involves juggling a number of
factors, including the priority (and scheduling classes) of the runnable
processes, NUMA locality, cache locality, latency minimization,
control-group policies, power management, overall fairness, and more.  One
might think that throwing another variable into the mix — and a complex one
at that — would not be something anybody would want to attempt.  The recent
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180907214047.26914-1-jschoenh@amazon.de/">coscheduling
patch set</a> from Jan Schönherr does exactly that, though, by introducing
the concept of processes that should be run simultaneously.
<p>
The core idea behind coscheduling is the marking of one or more control
groups as containing processes that should be run together.  If one process
in a coscheduled group is running on a specific set of CPUs (more on
that below), <i>only</i> processes from that group will be allowed to run
on those CPUs.  This rule holds even to the point of forcing some of the
CPUs to go idle if the given control group lacks runnable processes,
regardless of whether processes outside the group are runnable.
<p>
Why might one want to do such a thing?  Schönherr lists four motivations
for this work, the first of which is virtualization.  That may indeed be
the primary motivation, given that Schönherr is posting from an Amazon
address, and Amazon is rumored to be running a virtualized workload or
two.  A virtual machine usually contains multiple processes that interact
with each other; these machines will run more efficiently (and with lower
latencies) if those processes can run simultaneously.  Coscheduling would
ensure that all of a virtual machine's processes are run together,
maximizing locality and minimizing the latencies of the interactions between
them. 

<p>
Coscheduling can also be good for multiprocess applications that benefit
from sharing the processor cache.  If those processes are trying to access
the same data, having them running together on nearby CPUs will improve
their cache locality, and thus their performance.  Interestingly,
coscheduling might also help when used with independent processes that do
not share or, more to the point, contend for any resources.  Such processes
should 
be able to run simultaneously without interfering (much) with each other.
Coscheduling could ensure this coincidence, while avoiding workload mixes
that would be more likely to contend with each other.
<p>
Finally, coscheduling can be used to <i>prevent</i> certain processes from
running simultaneously.  For example, the <a href="/Articles/762570/">L1
terminal fault</a> hardware vulnerability can be used by a hostile process
to attack others running on a sibling processor (on systems where
hyperthreading is in use) — but not if those processes are in separate
coscheduled groups that cannot run together.  Temporally isolating
applications in this matter has the potential to close off a number of
side-channel attacks; it can be used as a form of mutual exclusion to
prevent some types of race conditions as well.
<p>
So there is potential value in coscheduling, but realizing that value is
not a straightforward proposition.  The coscheduling patch set contains a
full 60 patches and is clearly not yet ready to be considered for upstream
inclusion.  Even in its current form, it is sufficiently intimidating that
getting serious review is going to be a challenge.  But one has to start
somewhere; this patch set shows how coscheduling can work and will
allow developers to consider the impact on the scheduler as a whole.
<p>
<h4>Scheduling domains and run queues</h4>
<p>
Computer systems are organized in a hierarchical manner.  Even a relatively
simple machine may have two physical sockets for processor chips.  Each
socket will provide a number of CPUs, and each CPU may run multiple threads
(if hyperthreading is enabled).  Different resources (caches, for example)

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/sched-domains.svg"  width=30% max-width=384
alt="[Scheduling domain diagram]" hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right">

are shared at each level of the hierarchy.  Scheduling decisions must take
this hierarchy into account to make optimal use of the hardware.  To do
that, the scheduler creates and uses a set of data structures referred to as <a
href="/Articles/80911/">scheduling domains</a>.  The diagram on the right
shows how the scheduling domain layout might look for a simple desktop system
containing a single socket and two cores; each core implements what looks
like two CPUs, but which are actually hyperthreaded siblings sharing the
same underlying hardware.  The scheduler uses this hierarchy to know, for
example, that moving a process from CPU&nbsp;0 to CPU&nbsp;1 would be less
costly than moving it to CPU&nbsp;2.
<p>

In current kernels, the scheduler creates a run queue for each CPU in the
system; each queue holds all of the runnable processes waiting for its
associated CPU.  The scheduling decision for any given CPU involves only
that CPU's run queue, keeping the decision process local; processes are
occasionally moved between run queues as needed to keep the system as a
whole balanced.  Run queues are, thus, a feature found at the bottom level
of the scheduling domain hierarchy.  That changes with coscheduling, which
attaches new run queues at the higher levels of the hierarchy.
As a simple example, it would add two queues to the system diagrammed
above: one each for Core&nbsp;0 and Core&nbsp;1; it could also add a queue
at the socket level.

<p>
Whenever a coscheduled process is scheduled to run on a given core, the
core-level run queue will (simplifying a bit) be filled with the other
processes in 
the same control group.  At that point, all of the CPUs from that level of
the hierarchy on down (two of them, in this case) will be constrained to
select processes only from that coscheduled group; any other process that
is in the run queue for those processors will have to wait.  As noted
above, this policy extends to forcing one or more CPUs to go idle if
there are not enough runnable coscheduled processes to keep them busy, even
if other processes would like to run.
<p>
At some point, the scheduler will stop running the coscheduled group, at
which point the processors it was using will become available for other
processes — or for another coscheduled control group.  That could happen if
all processes in the group block, or if the scheduler decides to preempt the
group as a whole.  The latter decision involves some complexity, requiring
the designation of
a "leader" CPU for each level of the hierarchy where
coscheduling is enabled.

<p>
<h4>Administration and rough edges</h4>
<p>
The control of coscheduling happens at two points, the first of which is
the <tt>cosched_max_level</tt> kernel command-line option; its value is the
highest level above the bottom of the scheduling-domain hierarchy at which
coscheduling can be performed.  Setting it to zero (the default) disables
coscheduling entirely.  Setting it to one allows coscheduling at the core
level, while setting it to two would allow coscheduling at the socket
level.  Enabling coscheduling for any particular control group is a matter
of setting the new <tt>cpu.scheduled</tt> knob to the level at which
coscheduling should happen; setting it to one causes that group to be
coscheduled at the core level, for example.  This value can not be set
above the system-wide maximum set at boot time.
<p>
That is the core of how the feature works.  The details of actually making
it work are rather more involved, naturally.  Locking gets complicated when
dealing with run queues at multiple levels of the hierarchy, leading to the
introduction of two new locking protocols. Features like dynamic tick have
to be disabled "for now".  Preemption decisions become quite a bit more
complicated, since a newly runnable process must preempt an entire
coscheduled group (or not preempt at all). The complexities of adding this
feature into the scheduler seem likely to inspire discussion for some time.
<p>

There are some practical difficulties as well.  Scheduling domains are a
convenient mechanism for the creation of what might be called "coscheduling
domains", but users may well want to divide their systems differently.
Some high-end processors can hold 20 or more cores in a socket; that is a
lot of cores to hand over to a single coscheduled group, which may not need
anywhere near that many.  If the <tt>cosched_split_domains</tt> boot-time
option is used, the coscheduling mechanism will reorganize the system's
scheduling domains at boot time, adding a virtual layer that splits large
groups of processors into smaller ones.  That helps the coscheduling use
case, but it is also a sign that scheduling domains are being asked to fill
a role they were not intended for.

<p>
With the current
patch set, administrators must also use CPU affinities to force the
processes running in a coscheduled group to run within a specific set of
processors; the scheduler cannot, by itself, perform load balancing on such
groups.  So, for example, on the simple system described above, all of the
processes in a coscheduled control group would have to be constrained to
run only on CPUs&nbsp;0 and&nbsp;1, while another group would be bound to
CPUs&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3.
The resulting administrative busy-work required to use this
feature on a large system seems likely to lose its charm relatively
quickly.  There is also the little problem that transitions into and out of
the coscheduling mode are not entirely atomic, so any use case that depends
on 100% isolation of the coscheduled processes may not be served as desired.

<p>
The patch set is also lacking benchmarks, which will be necessary before it
can be seriously considered.  Developers will want to know what the
performance impact of coscheduling is, especially with regard to processes
that are <i>not</i> using the feature.  But, in any case, merging of the
coscheduling feature is a distant prospect at this point.  It is a huge
patch, set applied to one of the most sensitive parts of the kernel, that is
making its first public appearance; there will undoubtedly be a lot of
changes required before it can be considered ready.  This posting is just
the beginning of a long road; the end will only be reached if the
destination is deemed worth the trip.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sounds very interesting though. But it will certainly add the hell lot of complexity to gain that advantage. Truly, it will be a long travel path before anything meaningful(I mean real life usage) can come out.<br>

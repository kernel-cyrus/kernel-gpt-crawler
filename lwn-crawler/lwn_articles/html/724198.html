The Linux asynchronous I/O (AIO) layer tends to have many critics and few
defenders, but most people at least expect it to actually be asynchronous.  In
truth, an AIO operation can block in the kernel for a number of reasons,
making AIO difficult to use in situations where the calling thread truly
cannot afford to block.  A longstanding patch set aiming to improve this
situation would appear to be nearing completion, but it is more of a step
in the right direction than a true solution to the problem.
<p>
To perform AIO, a program must set up an I/O context with <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/io_setup.2.html"><tt>io_setup()</tt></a>,
fill in one or more <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/aio_abi.h#L73"><tt>iocb</tt>
structures</a> describing the operation(s) to 
be performed, then submit those structures with <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/io_submit.2.html"><tt>io_submit()</tt></a>.
A call to <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/io_getevents.2.html"><tt>io_getevents()</tt></a>
can be made to learn about the status of outstanding I/O operations and,
optionally, wait for them.  All of those system calls should, with the
exception of the last, be non-blocking.  In the real world, things are more
complicated.  Memory allocations or lock contention can cause any AIO
operation to block before it starts to move any data at all.  And, even in
the best-supported case (direct file I/O), the operation itself can block
in a number of places.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/722784/">no-wait AIO patch set</a> from Goldwyn
Rodrigues seeks to improve this situation in a number of ways.  It does not
make AIO any more asynchronous, but it will cause AIO operations to fail
with <tt>EAGAIN</tt> errors rather than block in a number of situations.
If a program is prepared for such errors, it can opportunistically try to
submit I/O in its main thread; it will then only need to fall back to a separate
submission thread in cases where the operation would block.
<p>
If a program is designed to use no-wait AIO, it must indicate the fact by
setting the new <tt>IOCB_RW_FLAG_NOWAIT</tt> flag in the <tt>iocb</tt>
structure.  That structure has a field (<tt>aio_flags</tt>) that is meant
to hold just this type of flag, but there is a problem: the kernel does not
currently check for unknown flags in that field.  That makes it impossible
to add a new flag, since a calling program can never know whether the
kernel it is running on supports that flag or not.  Fortunately, that
structure contains a couple of reserved fields that <i>are</i> checked in
current kernels; the field formerly known as <tt>aio_reserved1</tt> is
changed to <tt>aio_rw_flags</tt> in this patch set and used for the new
flag.
<p>
One of the places where an I/O request can block is if the operation will
trigger a writeback operation; in that case, the request will be held up
until the writeback completes.  This wait happens early in the submission
process; in particular, it can happen before <tt>io_submit()</tt> completes
its work and returns.  Setting <tt>IOCB_RW_FLAG_NOWAIT</tt> will cause
submission to fail with <tt>EAGAIN</tt> in this case.
<p>
Another common blocking point is I/O submission at the block level, where,
in particular, a request can be stalled because the underlying block device
is too busy.  Avoiding that involves the creation of a new
<tt>REQ_NOWAIT</tt> flag that can be set in the BIO structure used to describe
block I/O requests.  When that flag is present, I/O submission will, once
again, fail with an <tt>EAGAIN</tt> error rather than block waiting for the
level of block-device congestion to fall.
<p>
Support is also needed at the filesystem level; each filesystem has its own
places where execution can block on the way to submitting a request.  The
patch set includes support for Btrfs, ext4, and XFS.  In each case,
situations like the inability to obtain a lock on the relevant inode will
cause a request to fail.
<p>
All of this work can make AIO better, but only for a limited set of use
cases.  It only improves direct I/O, for example.  Buffered I/O, which has
always been a sort of second-class citizen in the AIO layer, is unchanged;
there are simply too many places where things can block to try to deal with
them all.  Similarly, there is no support for network filesystems or for
filesystems on MD or LVM volumes â€” though Rodrigues plans to fill some of
those gaps at some future point.
<p>
In other words, AIO seems likely to remain useful only for the handful of
applications that perform direct I/O to files.  There have been a number of
attempts to improve the situation in the past, including
<a href="/Articles/219954/">fibrils</a>,
<a href="/Articles/223899/">threadlets</a>,
<a href="/Articles/221913/">syslets</a>, 
<a href="/Articles/316806/">acall</a>,
and <a href="/Articles/671649/">an AIO reimplementation based on kernel
threads</a> done by the original AIO author.  None of those have ever
reached the point of being seriously considered for merging into the
mainline, though.  There are a lot of tricky details to be handled to
implement a complete solution, and nobody has ever found the goal to be
important enough to justify the considerable work required to come up with
a better solution to the problem.  So the kernel will almost certainly
continue to crawl forward with incremental improvements to AIO.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Last time I checked it seemed like we couldn't even trust the AIO layer to provide a reliable fsync() for buffered AIO, so it seems like it's pretty useless for anything except O_DIRECT.<br>

      O_DIRECT implies that the I/O won't be left rolling around in the OS' cache but says nothing about whether it is still in the disk device's non-volatile cache. You <em>could</em> send all I/Os down with O_SYNC too but speeds will plummet. Thus it's still desirable to be able to send down an fsync (and it would have been preferable if submitting it didn't have to block)...

      I appreciate the work on asynchronous I/O very much. There is a lot of potential to improve software with AIO. A good example I came across recently is the venerable <tt>find</tt>.
<p>
<tt>find</tt> is a single-threaded application that uses blocking IO. For each directory that it reads it does one or more <tt>getdents</tt> calls. These calls are done sequentially. <tt>find</tt> could be sped up by doing many calls at the same time.
<p>
Consider the extreme case where each subsequent directory is on the opposite site of the disk. The disk head would travel to the other side of the disk for each directory. The kernel IO scheduler cannot help because it only knows about the next location.
<p>
If 100 parallel requests were done instead of one, the IO scheduler would handle them in an efficient and quick manner: it would read the nearest entries first. It is possible to send parallel <tt>getdents</tt> requests with threads. This requires one thread per parallel request: quite an overhead. <a href="http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html">libuv</a> does this with a thread pool. This approach can roughly double the speed of <tt>find</tt> for a cold cache.
<p>
If this would be implemented with <tt>libaio</tt>, the thread overhead could be eliminated.

I think the problem is that older kernels ignore those bits entirely, rather than forcing them to be zeroed.  So there's no reliable way to find out whether the flag's having any effect.<br>

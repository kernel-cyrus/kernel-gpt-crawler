<h1>Two new system calls: splice() and sync_file_range()</h1>

The 2.6.17 kernel will include two new system calls which expand the
capabilities available to user-space programs in some interesting ways.
This article contains a
look at the current form of these new interfaces.

<p>

<h3>splice()</h3>
<p>

The <tt>splice()</tt> system call has a long history.  First
proposed by Larry McVoy in 1998; it was seen as a way of improving I/O
performance on server systems.  Despite being often mentioned in the
following years, no <tt>splice()</tt> implementation was ever created for
the mainline Linux kernel.  That situation changed, however, just before
the 2.6.17 merge window was closed when Jens Axboe's <tt>splice()</tt>
patch, along with a number of modifications, was merged.
<p>

As of this writing, the <tt>splice()</tt> interface looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    long splice(int fdin, int fdout, size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>splice()</tt> will cause the kernel to move up to
<tt>len</tt> bytes from the data source <tt>fdin</tt> to <tt>fdout</tt>.
The data will move through kernel space only, with a minimum of copying.  In
the current implementation, at least one of the two file descriptors must
refer to a pipe device.  That requirement is a limitation of the current
code, and it could be removed at some future time.
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> argument modifies how the copy is done.  Currently
implemented flags are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK</tt>: makes the <tt>splice()</tt> operations 
     non-blocking.  A call to <tt>splice()</tt> could still block, however,
     especially if either of the file descriptors has not been set for
     non-blocking I/O.
<p>
<li> <tt>SPLICE_F_MORE</tt>: a hint to the kernel that more data will come
     in a subsequent <tt>splice()</tt> call.
<p>
<li> <tt>SPLICE_F_MOVE</tt>: if the output is a file, this flag will cause
     the kernel to attempt to move pages directly from the input pipe
     buffer into the output address space, avoiding a copy operation.
</ul>
<p>
Internally, <tt>splice()</tt> works using the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/119682/">pipe buffer</a> mechanism added by
Linus in early 2005 - that is why one side of the operation is required to
be a pipe for now.  There are two additions to the ever-growing
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure for devices and filesystems which wish
to support <tt>splice()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*splice_write)(struct inode *pipe, struct file *out, 
                            size_t len, unsigned int flags);
    ssize_t (*splice_read)(struct file *in, struct inode *pipe, 
                           size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The new operations should move <tt>len</tt> bytes between <tt>pipe</tt> and
either <tt>in</tt> or <tt>out</tt>, respecting the given <tt>flags</tt>.
For filesystems, there are generic implementations of these operations
which can be used; there is also a <tt>generic_splice_sendpage()</tt> which
is used to enable splicing to a socket.  As of this writing, there are no
<tt>splice()</tt> implementations for device drivers, but there is nothing
preventing such implementations in the future, for char devices at least.
<p>

Discussions on the linux-kernel suggest that the <tt>splice()</tt>
interface could change before it is set in stone with the 2.6.17 release.
Andrew Tridgell has <a href="/Articles/178208/">requested</a> that an
offset argument be added to specify where copying should begin - either
that, or a separate <tt>psplice()</tt> should be added.  There is also some
concern about error handling; if a <tt>splice()</tt> call returns an error,
how does the application tell whether the problem is with the input or the
output?  Resolving those issues may require some interface changes over the
next month or so.
<p>

<h3>sync_file_range()</h3>
<p>

Early in the 2.6.17 process, some <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/171941/">changes to the
<tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> system call</a> were merged.  The new,
Linux-specific options were meant to give applications better control over
how data written to files is flushed to the physical media.  The
capabilities provided are needed, but there were concerns about extending a
POSIX-defined function in a Linux-specific way.  So, after some
discussions, Andrew Morton pulled that patch back out and replaced it with
a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    long sync_file_range(int fd, loff_t offset, loff_t nbytes, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will synchronize a file's data to disk, starting at the given
<tt>offset</tt> and proceeding for <tt>nbytes</tt> bytes (or to the end of
the file if <tt>nbytes</tt> is zero).  How the synchronization is done is
controlled by <tt>flags</tt>:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE</tt> blocks the calling process until 
     any already in-progress writeout of pages (in the given range)
     completes. 
<p>
<li> <tt>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</tt> starts writeout of any dirty pages in
     the given range which are not already under I/O.
<p>
<li> <tt>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER</tt> blocks the calling process until
     the newly-initiated writes complete.
</ul>
<p>
An application which wants to initiate writeback of all dirty pages should
provide the first two flags.  Providing all three flags guarantees that
those pages are actually on disk when the call returns.
<p>
The new implementation avoids distorting the <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt>
system call.  It also allows synchronization operations to be performed
with a single call, instead of the  multiple calls required by the previous
attempt.  In
the future, it may also be possible to add other operations to the
<tt>flags</tt> list; the ability to request metadata synchronization seems
to be high on the list.

some of the background information).<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Could someone please explain what the effect of splice() is supposed to be?  Is it just a faster way for the kernel to move data from one place to another?  Is this something that programs would use or would it be something that other parts of the kernel use?  I see that it has fdin and fdout as arguments.  Does that mean that it uses file descriptors and can be used for copying files?  I don't know anything about kernel development so I'm trying to put this feature into context.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>

      I gathered from LKML that sendfile is going to become a call to splice.  But sendfile will probably stay in the kernel for many versions to come for legacy support.  Linus does try to keep ABI compatibility for user-space.<br>

      sys_sendfile() can never go, as it's a part of the user space ABI. However, the internal implementation can be replaced with a call to splice() instead. The splice git branch has support for fd -&gt; fd splicing now (by using a virtual pipe), so sys_sendfile can basically just use that.<br>

But the internal pipe buffer uses dedicated pages, so there is   <br>
a minimum of one copy involved.  Doesn't sendfile() do zero-copy  <br>

Also why isn't splice() just called cat()? <br>

      It is zero-copy, why do you think the pipe pages are copied before being transmitted? Splice can even do zero-copy file copies, by moving pages from one file to another.<br>

Yeah it sounds crazy, but it's really true :-). You bring in the pages from the source file, then migrate them to the address space of the target file. Bingo, zero copy copies!<br>

      It sounds funny only because you're using "copy" two different ways in the same sentence.  When we talk about copying a file, we're talking about copying from disk to disk.  When we say zero-copy, we're talking about copying data from memory to memory.

<p>A splice-based file copy does one disk-disk copy, and no memory-memory copy, as contrasted with the traditional file copy that does one disk-disk copy plus two memory-memory copies.

<P>Since the naive observer wouldn't even expect there to be memory-memory copies involved in copying files, "zero copy file copy" shouldn't sound odd at all.

      A splice based copy does no copies. The source data is DMA'ed from hardware to the source file page(s), then those pages are moved to the destination and dirted to so will eventually go out to disk again with another DMA operations.<br>
<p>
A normal copy will DMA those pages in, allocate pages in the target file address space, copy that data over, and then it'll be DMA'ed to disk again. So two DMA operations, and one full copy of all the data.<br>
<p>
So a splice based copy will be zero memory copies, and two DMA "copies" (the dma operation above may be a series of dma transactions, depending on how large the file is). A normal copy contains the same number of DMA operations, but includes a memory copy.<br>

      <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
I presume "copies" is in quotes because you agree with me that the DMA operations are not copies in the sense we're talking about.  (If they were, a "zero-copy" file read wouldn't be zero-copy, and moving data from kernel file data cache to user space would be two copies (kernel memory to register, register to user memory)).
<p>
However, the combination of the two DMAs constitutes one disk copy.  A disk copy is an instance of replicating data from one place on a disk to another, just as a memory copy is an instance of replicating data from one place in memory to another.  And it's worth talking about because it takes time.  If you could truly do a zero-copy copy, that would be remarkable.  As it stands, "zero-copy copy" is just a trick of words in which you change the definition of copy in the middle of the sentence.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the most normal file copy includes two memory copies -- from kernel file data cache of the source file to user space buffer, and from that buffer to the other file's kernel file data cache.  With mmap, you can get it down to one, and with direct I/O you can get to zero.

      Copy is in quotes, because it's not the CPU doing the copy. Which is what is interesting, and why zero-copy just means zero CPU copies. That is where you pay the cost, at least in CPU cycles and potentially also in cache. So zero-copy definitely isn't just a play on words. It may sometimes be used in silly marketing ways, but if you are CPU bound it makes all the difference in the world that the CPU doesn't have to touch the data.<br>
<p>
And yes, the normal copy is indeed two copies, to and from kernel/user space.<br>
<p>
You can continue talking if you want, but don't expect a response from me.<br>

This is an in-joke, from the text adventure game version of Douglas <br>
Adams' Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy: <br>
 <br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;open door </font><br>
The door explains, in a haughty tone, that the room is occupied <br>
by a super-intelligent robot and that lesser beings (by which <br>
it means you) are not to be admitted. "Show me some tiny example <br>
of your intelligence," it says, "and maybe, just maybe, I might <br>
reconsider." <br>
 <br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;get tea </font><br>
no tea: Dropped. <br>
 <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;inventory </font><br>
You have: <br>
  no tea <br>
  tea <br>
  a small key <br>
  a flowerpot <br>
  a thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is <br>
  a babel fish (in your ear) <br>
 <br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;open door </font><br>
The door is almost speechless with admiration. "Wow. Simultaneous <br>
tea and no tea. My apologies. You are clearly a heavy-duty <br>
philosopher." It opens respectfully. <br>

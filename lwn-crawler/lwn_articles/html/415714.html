           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 16, 2010</br>
           </div>
Over the course of the last decade, video acquisition hardware has evolved
from relatively rare, bulky, external devices to being a standard feature
in a large variety of 
gadgets.  Increasingly, chipsets intended for embedded use have video
support as a standard feature.  This support is becoming more
complex; contemporary video devices are not just frame grabbers anymore.
That complexity is revealing limitations in the kernel's device model,
prompting the proposal of a new "media controller" abstraction.  This
article will provide an overview and mild critical review of this new
subsystem.
<p>
Video acquisition devices have never been entirely simple.  Even a minimal
camera device will usually be a composite of at least three distinct
devices: a
sensor, a DMA bridge to move frames between the sensor and main memory, and
an I2C bus dedicated to controlling the sensor.  Most devices coming onto
the market now are more sophisticated than that.  For example, the
integrated controller in current VIA chipsets (still a very simple device)
adds a "high-quality video" (HQV) unit which can perform image rotation and
format conversions; that unit can be configured into or out of the
processing pipeline depending
on the application's needs.  For a more complex example, consider the OMAP
3430, which is found in N900 phones; it has multiple video inputs, a white
balance processor, a lens shading compensation processor, a resizer, and
more.
<p>
Each of these components can be thought of as a separate device which can
be powered up or down independently, and which, in some cases, can be
configured in or out at any given time.  The current V4L2 system wasn't
designed with this kind of device structure in mind, and neither was the
current Linux device model.  An added problem is that these devices can be
tied with devices managed by other subsystems - audio devices in
particular - making it hard for applications to grasp the whole picture.
The media controller is an attempt to rectify that situation.
<p>
The most recent version of the media controller patch was <a
href="/Articles/408392/">posted</a> by Laurent Pinchart back in September;
if all goes according to plan, it will be merged for 2.6.38.  The patch
creates a new <tt>media_device</tt> type which has the responsibility of
managing the various components which make up a media-related device.
These components are called "entities"; and they can take many forms.
Sensors, DMA engines, video processing units, focus controllers, audio
devices, and more are all considered to be "entities" in this scheme.
<p>
Most entities will have at least one "pad," being a logical connection
point where data can 
flow into or out of the device.  "Data" in this sense can be multimedia
data, but it might also be a control stream.  Pads are exclusively input
("sink") or output ("source") ports, and an entity can have an arbitrary
number of each.  The final piece is called a "link"; it is a directional
connection from a source pad to a sink.  Links are created by the media
device driver, but they can, in some cases, be enabled or disabled from
user space.
<p>
Using this scheme, the simple VIA device described above could be
represented with three entities and three links:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/media-controller.png" width=422 height=62
alt="[Media controller]">
</blockquote>
<p>
The "sensor" entity has a single source pad which can be connected, via
links, to the HQV unit or directly to the DMA controller.  Only one of
those paths can be active at once.  The HQV unit has two pads - one sink,
one source - allowing it to be slotted into the video pipeline if need be.
The DMA controller has a single sink pad.
<p>
As an aside: entities also have a "group" number assigned to them; groups
are intended to indicate hardware which is meant to function together.  All
of the units described above would probably be placed into the same group
by the driver.  If there were a microphone attached to the camera, then the
associated audio entity would also be placed in the same group.  This
mechanism is intended to make it easier for applications to associate
related devices with each other.
<p>
On the application side, there is a device (probably <tt>/dev/media0</tt>
or some such) which can be opened to gain access to this device.  From
there, the interface looks very much like the rest of V4L2 - lots of
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls to discover what is available and configure it.
These calls include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>MEDIA_IOC_DEVICE_INFO</tt> to get overall information about the 
     device: driver name, device model, etc.
<p>
<li> <tt>MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_ENTITIES</tt> is used to iterate through all of the
     entities contained within the device.  Information returned includes
     an ID number, a coarse entity type (e.g. V4L or ALSA), a subtype (few
     of these are defined in the patch; "sensor" is one of them), the group
     ID, the device number, and the numbers of pads and links.
<p>
<li> <tt>MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_LINKS</tt> iterates through all of the links
     attached to source pads on a given entity.  Thus, it is only possible
     to discover the outbound links from any entity; obtaining the whole
     graph requires iterating through all entities.
<p>
<li> <tt>MEDIA_IOC_SETUP_LINK</tt> changes the properties of a specific
     link; in particular, it can enable or disable the link (though 
     links can be marked "immutable" by the driver).  Enabling a link will
     have the side 
     effect of powering up all components reachable via that link, while
     disabling the last link to an entity will cause that entity to be
     powered down.  Thus, changing the status of a link affects both the
     data path and the power configuration of a device.
</ul>
<p>
Thus far, there have been no applications posted which actually use this
framework (though a gstreamer source element is in the works).  One can
certainly see the utility of being able to discover and 
modify the configuration of a complex media device in this manner.  But, at
the Linux Plumbers Conference, your editor heard some concerns that the
complexity of this interface could prove daunting to application
developers.  An application which is intended to work with a specific
device (the camera application on a mobile handset, say) can be written
with a relatively high level of awareness of that device and make good use
of this interface.  Writing an application which can make full use of any
device - without requiring the developer to know about specific hardware -
could be more challenging.
<p>
One other concern raised at LPC was that this functionality should really
be exported via sysfs rather than through an <tt>ioctl()</tt>-based API.
The information contained here would fit well within a sysfs hierarchy,
with links represented by symbolic links in the filesystem.  Given that the
configuration interface (in its current form) changes
a single bit at a time, there is no need 
for the sort of transactional functionality that can make <tt>ioctl()</tt>
preferable to sysfs.  On the other hand, V4L2 applications are already a
big mass of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls; the media controller API will be a
natural fit while rooting through sysfs would be a new experience for V4L2
developers. 
<p>
Something else is worth thinking about here: the problem may be bigger than
just media devices.  More complex devices are the norm, and it is becoming
clear that the kernel's hierarchical device model is not up to the task of
representing the structure of our systems.  Back in 2009, Rafael Wysocki <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/347573/">proposed a mechanism</a> for
representing power-management dependencies with explicit links.  The media
controller mechanism looks quite similar; it is even being used for power
management purposes.  That suggests that we should be looking for a data
structure which can represent device connections and dependencies across
the kernel, not just in one subsystem.  Otherwise we run the risk of
creating duplicated structures and multiple user-space ABIs, all of which
must be supported indefinitely.
<p>
The media controller subsystem is aimed at solving a real problem, and it
is certainly a credible solution.  It is also a significant new user-space
ABI, one which does not necessarily conform to current ideas of how
interfaces should be done.  The work done here may also be applicable well
beyond the V4L2 and ALSA subsystems, but any attempt at a bigger-picture
solution should probably be made before the code is merged and the ABI is
set in stone.  All of this suggests that the media controller code could
benefit from review outside of the V4L mailing list, which tends to be
inhabited by relatively focused developers.

Very interesting, and reminds me somewhat of intel's HDA spec.<br>

Perhaps the solution lies along those lines too.<br>

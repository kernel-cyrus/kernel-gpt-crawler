A common filesystem workload follows a simple pattern: work through a list
of files in a directory, and use <tt>stat()</tt> to obtain information
about each of those files.  The "<tt>ls&nbsp;-l</tt>" command is a classic
example of this type of workload, but there are many others.  This workload
has always run more slowly on Linux systems than developers would like, but
getting a solution into the kernel has happened even more slowly.
Recently, a pair of possible solutions was posted by Abhi Das; perhaps
this time this issue will be resolved — in a surprising way.
<p>
The problem with the "<tt>ls -l</tt>" workload is simple enough: two system
calls are required for each file of interest.  A call to
<tt>getdents()</tt> (usually via the <tt>readdir()</tt> function in the C
library) obtains the name of a file in the directory; then <tt>stat()</tt>
is called to get the information about that file.  The <tt>stat()</tt>
call, in particular, can be expensive, with each call forcing the
underlying filesystem to perform I/O to obtain the desired information.  In
some cases, that information may be spread across multiple on-disk data structures,
requiring even more I/O, even if the calling application does not actually
use everything that <tt>stat()</tt> returns.  Doing all this work is inefficient;
it would be nice if there were a way to limit the information gathered to
what the application actually needs and to get that information in batches.
<p>
This issue is not new; it was, in fact, already somewhat old when it was
discussed at the <a href="/Articles/327740/#readdirplus">2009 Linux Storage and
Filesystem Workshop</a>.  A proposed solution, in the form of the <a
href="/Articles/394298/"><tt>xstat()</tt> system call</a>, was posted in
2010 but did not get very far.  At this point, well into 2014, some
filesystems have code to try to optimize for this kind of workload, but
there is still no general solution in the kernel.  For the last few years,
there has appeared to be little interest among developers in working on
this problem.
<p>
In that setting, Abhi has come forward with two independent solutions
demonstrating two separate approaches to the problem.  His hope is to get
feedback on both and, once one of them emerges as the preferred solution,
get it into the mainline kernel.
<p>
<h4>xgetdents()</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/606713/">first approach</a> builds on the 2010
<tt>xstat()</tt> system call by David Howells.  It adds two new system calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int xstat(int dirfd, const char *filename, unsigned int flags,
    	      unsigned int mask, struct xstat *info);
    int fxstat(int fd, unsigned int flags, unsigned int mask, struct xstat *info);
</pre>
<p>
The first form looks up a given file by name, while the second returns
information for an open file identified by its descriptor.  The
<tt>flags</tt> field is there to change the operation of the system call;
there is little use of it in this patch set.  Of more interest is
<tt>mask</tt>, which tells the kernel which information is being requested
by the application.  There are quite a few bits that can be set here;
examples include <tt>XSTAT_MODE</tt> (for the file protection bits),
<tt>XSTAT_UID</tt> (file owner), <tt>XSTAT_RDEV</tt> (underlying storage
device), <tt>XSTAT_ATIME</tt> (last access time), or <tt>XSTAT_INO</tt>
(inode number).  <tt>XSTAT_ALL_STATS</tt> can be used to request all
available information.
On a successful return, the <tt>info</tt> structure will be filled in with
the requested data.
<p>
On top of this work, Abhi has added another system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int xgetdents(unsigned int fd, unsigned int flags, unsigned int mask,
		  void *buf, unsigned int count);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>fd</tt> is a file descriptor for the directory of interest, while
<tt>flags</tt> and <tt>mask</tt> are as above (though <tt>mask</tt> has
been extended to allow the application to request various types of extended
attribute data). Information is returned in 
<tt>buf</tt>, which is a simple byte array, <tt>count</tt> bytes in length.  The
<tt>xgetdents()</tt> call will attempt to retrieve information about
multiple files in the given directory until <tt>buf</tt> fills.
<p>
The actual data returned in <tt>buf</tt> is somewhat complex.  The
top-level structures defining this information are:
<p>
<pre>
    struct xdirent_blob {
	unsigned int    xb_xattr_count;
	char            xb_blob[1]; /* contains variable length data like
				     * NULL-terminated name, xattrs etc */
    };

    struct linux_xdirent {
	unsigned long        xd_ino;
	char                 xd_type;
	unsigned long        xd_off;
	struct xstat         xd_stat;
	unsigned long        xd_reclen;
	struct xdirent_blob  xd_blob;
    };
</pre>
<p>

The documentation of the return format is somewhat sparse.  Actually, it
does not exist at all, so one is forced to reverse-engineer it from the
code.  It appears that information for each file will be returned in one
variable-length <tt>linux_xdirent</tt> structure.  The name of the file is
the first thing stored in <tt>xd_blob</tt>, followed by extended attribute
information if that has been requested.  This structure clearly requires a
bit of work to understand and pick apart on the user-space side, but it
does have the advantage of allowing all of that information to be collected
and returned in a single system call.
<p>
<h4>dirreadahead()</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/606712/">alternative approach</a> is rather
simpler.  It adds a single system call:
<p>
<pre>
	int dirreadahead(unsigned int fd, loff_t *offset, unsigned int count);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attempt to initiate the reading of file information for
<tt>count</tt> files in the directory represented by <tt>fd</tt>, starting
at the given <tt>offset</tt> within the directory.  The <tt>offset</tt>
value will be updated to reflect the number of files whose information was
actually read.  One can thus use multiple <tt>dirreadahead()</tt> calls to
work through a directory with the kernel maintaining the <tt>offset</tt>
value as things progress.
<p>
In this case, it is still necessary to call <tt>getdents()</tt> and
<tt>stat()</tt> to get the needed information.  What changes is that, with
luck, the filesystem will have already pulled that information into an
internal cache, so the calls should be handled quickly.  Reading
information for multiple files at once allows batching to be done; even if
the information is dispersed on physical media, the necessary I/O
operations can be reordered for optimal execution.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/607019/">introductory message</a> to the two patch
sets included some benchmark results on the GFS2 filesystem.  Both
approaches performed better 
than mainline kernels when presented with a workload heavy with
<tt>getdents()</tt> and <tt>stat()</tt> system calls.  Perhaps
surprisingly, <tt>dirreadahead()</tt> consistently performed far better
than <tt>xgetdents()</tt>.  That result may be an artifact of the
<tt>xgetdents()</tt> implementation or of the GFS2 filesystem, but it shows
that the far simpler readahead-based approach is worthy of consideration.
<p>
The readahead idea quickly led to questions of whether the kernel could somehow
perform this readahead automatically, as it does with basic file I/O.
Trond Myklebust <a href="/Articles/607022/">noted</a> that the NFS client
tries to detect workloads where this kind of readahead might be of value.
In the general case, though, this detection is hard to do; there is no
obvious connection within the kernel between the <tt>getdents()</tt> and
<tt>stat()</tt> calls.  So, for now at least, it may be up to user space to
communicate that information directly.  Either of the two interfaces
described here could be used for that communication, but it seems that the
relative simplicity of the <tt>dirreadahead()</tt> approach would argue
strongly in its favor, even in the absence of better benchmark results.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Maybe dirreadahead is faster because it allows the kernel to do I/O while the user space program is still processing results, i.e. it's an asynchronous interface.<br>
<p>
While dirreadahead certainly has its appeal due to its simplicity and maybe even better performance, but xstat could be useful in other use cases as well. For example we do lots of stat calls to compare mtimes of a source and a preprocessed cache file to detect if we have to re-process the source. In this case we know both file names and just need the mtime.<br>

Yes, dirreadahead is faster because it does the readahead asynchronously and using multiple workqueues. On the other hand xgetdents is single-threaded and there is a lot of processing involved in collating all the data into the result __user buffer. And yes, the user space program needs to deconstruct the buffer too.<br>

libguestfs's FUSE driver also performs readahead as soon as a client begins a readdir of a directory.  It massively improved performance of simple commands like 'ls' as well as things like the Nautilus file browser.<br>

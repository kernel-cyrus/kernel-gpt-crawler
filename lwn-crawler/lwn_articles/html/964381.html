           </div>
Before loading a BPF program, the kernel must verify that the program is
safe to run; among other things, that verification includes ensuring that
the program will terminate within a bounded time.  That requirement has
long made writing loops in BPF a challenging task.  The situation has
improved over the years for some types of loops, but others — including
linked-list traversal — are still awkward in BPF programs.  A new set of
BPF primitives aims to make life easier for this use case through the
installation of what can be seen as a sort of circuit breaker.
<p>
Even relatively simple loops can be hard for the verifier to handle.  To
the human eye, a loop like this looks safe:
<p>
<pre>
    for (i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++)
    	do_something(i);
</pre>
<p>
It can be hard, though, for the verifier (which is dealing with lower-level
code for the BPF virtual machine) to know that nothing will reset
the value of the iteration variable in a loop, though; without that
assurance, it cannot verify that the loop will terminate as expected.  Over
the years, a number of helpers have been added to make this kind of
iteration easier; they include the <a
href="/Articles/877062/"><tt>bpf_loop()</tt> function</a> and <a
href="/Articles/926041/">generic iterators</a>.  This sort of bounded
iteration is now relatively easy to do in BPF programs.
<p>
If one is iterating through a linked list, though, there is no loop
variable that can bound the number of times the loop will run.  There is no
way for the verifier to know about the properties of a list that a program
would like to traverse.  If the list is circular, traversal could go
forever.  That prospect makes the verifier grumpy, forcing developers to
engage in workarounds that make them even grumpier.  When Alexei
Starovoitov recently <a
href="/ml/bpf/20240227055235.23463-2-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/">proposed
a solution</a> to this problem, he provided an example of the code needed
(in current kernels) to go through a list stored in a <a
href="/Articles/961941/">BPF arena</a>:
<p>
<pre>
    for (struct bpf_iter_num ___it __attribute__((aligned(8),
                                                  cleanup(bpf_iter_num_destroy))),
		* ___tmp = (bpf_iter_num_new(&amp;___it, 0, (1000000)),
                    	pos = list_entry_safe((head)-&gt;first,
                                              typeof(*(pos)), member),
	                (void)bpf_iter_num_destroy,
		     	(void *)0);
	bpf_iter_num_next(&amp;___it) &amp;&amp; pos &amp;&amp;
            ({ ___tmp = (void *)pos-&gt;member.next; 1; });
        pos = list_entry_safe((void __arena *)___tmp, typeof(*(pos)), member))
</pre>
<p>
Briefly, this construct creates a new generic iterator (the
<tt>bpf_iter_num_new()</tt> call) set for a maximum of 1,000,000
iterations.  The <tt>bpf_iter_num_next()</tt> call increments that iterator
and forces an exit from the loop if it goes too high.  The iterator is
never expected to reach anything close to the maximum value; it exists only
to reassure the verifier that something will force the loop to end at some
point.
<p>
One might fairly conclude that this code is not pleasant to write — and
even less pleasant to try to understand.  But, as Starovoitov put it:
"<q>Unfortunately every 'for' in normal C code needs an equivalent monster
macro</q>".  He initially proposed a solution (a function called
<tt>bpf_can_loop()</tt>), but the shape of that solution changed fairly
quickly.
<p>
As of <a
href="/ml/bpf/20240306031929.42666-1-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/">the v6
patch set</a>, the first step is to create a bit of infrastructure in the
form of a new BPF instruction called <tt>may_goto</tt>.  This instruction
has some interesting semantics.  If the kernel sees a <tt>may_goto</tt>
instruction in a code block, it will automatically reserve space for an
iteration count on the stack.  Each execution of <tt>may_goto</tt>
increments that count and compares it to a kernel-defined maximum; if that
maximum is exceeded, a <tt>goto</tt> will be executed to a point just far
enough ahead to insert another <tt>goto</tt>.
<p>
This instruction is used to create a macro called <tt>cond_break</tt> that
turns into BPF code like this:
<p>
<pre>
    		 may_goto l_break;
   		 goto l_continue;
    l_break: 	 break;
    l_continue:  ;
</pre>
<p>
In words: the macro normally uses <tt>may_goto</tt> to cause (by way of a
bit of a <tt>goto</tt> dance) a <tt>break</tt> to be executed when the loop
count is exceeded.  This macro could, in turn, be used in this sort of
loop:
<p>
<pre>
    for (ptr = first_item; ptr; ptr = ptr-&gt;next)
    {
        do_something_with(ptr);
	cond_break;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The presence of <tt>cond_break</tt> (which uses <tt>may_goto</tt>) in the
loop causes stack space to be set aside for an iteration count; the maximum
is set to <tt>BPF_MAX_LOOPS</tt>, which is defined as <tt>8*1024*1024</tt> in
current kernels.  Each execution of <tt>cond_break</tt> checks the
iteration count and forces an exit from the loop if the maximum is
exceeded.
<p>
Should that forced exit ever happen, chances are good that something is
going wrong.  Either some sort of out-of-control loop has been created, or
the list to process is too long and the traversal will not be completed as
expected.  But, again, in real programs, exceeding the loop count is not
expected to ever happen.  It exists only as a sort of circuit breaker to
reassure the verifier that the loop is safe to run.  Or, as Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAADnVQKKFxioLAqLPNq7mvt4GOHpC0j80-SUYzYQkpno3d+49Q@mail.gmail.com/">put
it</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In other words "cond_break" is a contract between the verifier and
	the program. The verifier allows the program to loop assuming it's
	behaving well, but reserves the right to terminate it.  So [a] bpf
	author can assume that cond_break is a nop if their program is well
	formed.
</blockquote>
<p>
The promise of the BPF verifier — that it would be able to guarantee that
BPF programs cannot harm the kernel — was always going to be hard to
achieve without imposing significant limitations on developers.  Much of
the work on BPF over the years has been aimed at lifting some of those
limitations, which have only become more onerous as the complexity of BPF
programs has increased.  As awkward as the new features may seem, they are
less so than what came before.
<p>
Still, there is room for improvement.  Starovoitov said that relying on
loop counts was not the best approach, and that "<q>the actual limit of
BPF_MAX_LOOPS is a random number</q>"; he suggested that the kernel may
eventually implement a watchdog timer to simply interrupt programs that run
for too long.  That might remove some of the awkwardness, but would have
some interesting implications; BPF programs are not written with the idea
that they could be interrupted at an arbitrary point.  Addressing that
could take a while; in the meantime, there is <tt>cond_break</tt>.  There
do not seem to be objections to the changes, and the patch set <a
href="/ml/bpf/170975102930.9518.8336084287032577662.git-patchwork-notify@kernel.org/">has
been merged</a> into the bpf-next repository, so <tt>cond_break</tt> seems
likely to show up in the mainline during the 6.9 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's interesting how this difficultly of analyzing linked list traversal in BPF mirrors the way CPUs struggle analyzing it. Which is a big reason why they are so disastrously slow and really shouldn't be used in any remotely performance sensitive context today. I guess the lesson is if BPF doesn't like your code, your cpu probably won't either :)<br>

Indeed, it's my understanding that it's more efficient for traversal to allocate an array of node records and then make a linked list based on array indices.  This may also shrink the memory footprint because the array index (aka 'pointer') may be smaller (u16 or even u8) than a machine pointer.<br>

If you're creating a dependency between the next address to access and the contents of the previous address, that's going to be bad regardless of whether you use indexes or pointers. BPF wouldn't like that either. You really just want a count and some data; that's trivial to analyze.<br>
<p>
Allocating stuff together does make a big difference and you should definitely do it. But at that point you may as well just use the length and capacity values you have to store anyway to do a proper dynamic array. Then just swap elements in place or, if you must, have a separate table of indexes sorted by some other value, like in a hashtable. Or just use a well implemented tree or hash table outright. But really most of the time you don't need any of that.<br>

That doesn't actually do linked-list-by-index-instead-of-pointer. Someone who's interested can make that modification. But it's about 10x as fast to walk an array of random pointers as it is to walk a list of random pointers, depending on your CPU.<br>

Perhaps a useful optimization would be to define a magic pointer value which means “next one in memory”. You could even use null for that if you have some other way to signal end of list. Then your code would be like <br>
<p>
if (curr-&gt;next == MAGIC) ++curr;<br>
else curr = curr-&gt;next;<br>
<p>
If the linked list is laid out mostly continuously in memory most of the time (perhaps not completely contiguous all of the time, because then you’d be using an array or vector instead) then the branch predictor should be able to learn the first case is more common and the code can run almost as fast as an ordinary loop over an array. <br>

You don't need magic for that:<br>
<p>
if (curr-&gt;next == curr + 1) ++curr;<br>
else curr = curr-&gt;next;<br>
<p>
But I don't get why that would help.<br>
You can just say curr = curr-&gt;next, because you need to load the next pointer anyway.<br>

I wouldn't be surprised if the compiler would optimize it into that.<br>

You need to load the next pointer but the processor can learn that it’s usually the following address and load it speculatively. Whereas if you simply dereference it the processor might not be able to look so far ahead. That’s my thinking. <br>
<p>
If the flag to say “just increment” were included in a part of the data structure you have to load anyway, then it might save some memory access too. <br>

Correct, so it would be faster on average, and a lot of the time the next location will be loaded whether or not it’s useful, regardless of list design — cache lines can only be loaded as a whole. <br>
<p>
This isn’t a new approach, by the way. LISP famously uses lists a lot, and LISP machines needed to process them quickly. Even with memory latency at the time being much lower relative to CPU speeds, laying them out contiguously in memory was a standard trick. One way to do that is to use a copying garbage collector, which if coded correctly will automatically defragment the lists when they’re copied. <br>

There's hash tables that do this. But I think in reality that's kind of just otherthinking it. Very few C programs use linked lists for good reasons and want or need any of the very few positive properties of them. It's mostly just used because it's the first thing you learn in school and perhaps more importantly the only datastructure that's easy to implement and use in C without macro hell. That and not nearly enough people tell programmers it's a bad idea.*<br>
<p>
* this goes beyond just performance implications but architectural decisions too. One of the "advantages" of linked lists is that list items rarely move once they get created. This inevitably leads to things like structures getting bloated with information really only needed by one user and people stashing long-lived pointers to objects on lists somewhere without really worrying about how long they'll stay valid for, which ossifies into the familiar pointer hell codebase where you're scared of changing anything because something might still be holding a pointer to it and 5% of your CPU time is refcounting. But I digress.<br>

There's no real reason the kernel can't allocate its internal data in a contiguous virtual RAM. It's just that right now the kernel has one simple 1-to-1 mapping.<br>

<p>
It's a long and winding path towards BPF being just a bad version of WebAssembly. (Bad because, among other reasons, it will be encrusted with all these different attempts to avoid just using a watchdog timer, which will have to be supported indefinitely.)<br>

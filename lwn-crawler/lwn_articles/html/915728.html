<p>Shadow stacks are one of the methods employed to enforce <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">control-flow
integrity</a> and thwart attackers; they are a mechanism for fine-grained,
backward-edge protection.  Most of the time, applications are not even
aware that shadow stacks are in use.  As is so often the case, though, life
gets more complicated when the <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace</a>
(CRIU) mechanism is in use.  Not breaking CRIU turns out to be one of the
big challenges facing developers working to get user-space shadow-stack
support into the kernel.  <p>

The idea behind shadow stacks is simple: in addition to the normal program
stack (which holds return addresses, local variables, and more) there is a
special memory area, called the "shadow stack", that
stores only return addresses. Whenever a <tt>CALL</tt> instruction is
executed, the return address is pushed onto both the normal and the shadow
stacks. When, later, a function ends with a <tt>RET</tt> instruction, the
return address that's popped from the normal stack is compared to that on
the shadow stack. If they match, the execution continues; if they don't,
a violation of control-flow integrity has just been detected.

<p>Recent x86 processor models implement shadow stacks in hardware, meaning
that no instrumentation is required for a program to get the protection
that shadow stacks provide and that the cost of using a shadow stack is
negligible. Once the feature is enabled, the CPU takes care of pushing and
popping the return address on the shadow stack and comparing the return
addresses. If the return addresses do not match, the CPU generates a control
protection exception.
To support shadow stacks, the x86 architecture has been extended with a
model-specific register (MSR) that controls the use of the shadow stack and
its features.  There are also shadow-stack pointer MSRs (one for each
possible privilege level) and a set of instructions for manipulating
shadow-stack contents.

<p>The discussion about how kernel should support <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/758245/">shadow stacks for user space</a>
started a long time ago, but it has still not concluded. One of the
difficulties in enabling this feature is the possibility that some
applications will be broken by shadow stacks because they use non-standard
ways to change their control flow.  The list of problematic applications
includes GDB, various JIT engines, and, of course, CRIU.

<h4>CRIU and shadow stacks</h4>

<p>CRIU is known for its intimate relations with the kernel and its use of
obscure kernel interfaces. Among other things, CRIU has to intervene in the
control flow of the tasks to be checkpointed in order to extract the
information that
cannot be obtained by other means (such as from the <tt>/proc</tt> file
system).  When restoring a saved process, CRIU has to be able to
recreate its state as it was at checkpoint time, so if the process had
a shadow stack enabled, that shadow stack has to be restored exactly as it
was before the checkpoint.

<p>To checkpoint (or "dump" in CRIU jargon) a process, CRIU injects a blob
with parasite code into the target to get parts of the process state that
are not visible from the outside or which can only be obtained
slowly and painfully. To inject the parasite, CRIU stops the task with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>,
finds a free area in the task's memory layout, puts the parasite code
there, and makes the task jump into that code. So far,
there are no conflicts with shadow-stack enforcement because, after the
parasite starts running, the <tt>CALL</tt> and <tt>RET</tt> instructions within
the parasite are properly paired.

<p> There is, however, a problem when the parasite's job is done and the
normal process execution should be resumed. CRIU uses the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigreturn.2.html"><tt>sigreturn()</tt></a>
system call, which is normally only invoked at the end of a signal handler,
to "cure" the task of the parasite and resume its normal execution. This
operation could be done with <tt>ptrace()</tt>, but <tt>sigreturn()</tt>
reduces the synchronization complexity between CRIU and the parasite and,
more importantly, allows the task to continue even if CRIU itself fails.

<p>The implementation of <tt>sigreturn()</tt> in the kernel takes special
measures to ensure that its usage does not violate shadow-stack
integrity. Whenever the kernel needs to deliver a signal to a process,
it sets up the return frame that will be used when signal
handler is concluded; it also pushes some data to the shadow stack
and then verifies the integrity of that data when <tt>sigreturn()</tt> is
called. Since CRIU uses <tt>sigreturn()</tt> directly — without any signal
being delivered to the process that is being dumped — it has to tweak the
shadow-stack contents to match the state expected by the kernel.  The
modification of the shadow-stack pointer is done using a couple of
<tt>ptrace()</tt> calls are part of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221104223604.29615-1-rick.p.edgecombe@intel.com">latest
API</a> proposed for shadow-stack enablement; the shadow-stack contents can
already be adjusted using existing <tt>ptrace()</tt> calls. This
shadow-stack modification is performed early during parasite
injection in order to preserve the ability to resume normal task execution if
anything goes wrong.

<p>Once parasite injection and removal are handled, dumping a process with
a shadow stack enabled is simple. The only difference from a "normal" dump
is the need to save the shadow-stack enable/disable state and the
shadow-stack pointer, both of which can be easily done with the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> calls. The shadow-stack memory area is saved exactly as
any other anonymous memory and does not require any special
care.

<h4>CRIU restore</h4>

<p>Restoring a process with a shadow stack is slightly more involved than
dumping. When CRIU restores a process tree, it creates all of the tasks and
threads found in the checkpoint and then modifies them so that their state
will be exactly as the state that was saved at dump time. After the state
of each thread is restored, CRIU sets up a <tt>sigreturn()</tt> frame for
each thread, cleans up leftovers of the original CRIU process, and calls
<tt>sigreturn()</tt> to restart the execution of the restored tasks. In
order to restore the shadow stack, CRIU needs to be able to map the
shadow-stack memory at exactly at the same address as it was before the
dump.  CRIU also needs a way to efficiently populate the contents of the
shadow stack with the saved data and the ability to set the shadow-stack
control bits and pointer.  Additionally, the kernel API lets the C library
and program loader lock various shadow-stack features; CRIU must thus be
able to ensure that these feature locks are kept after a restore.

<p>Since shadow-stack memory is somewhat special, the virtual memory area
for it should be created with proposed <tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt> system
call (described in <a href="/Articles/885220/">this article</a>) rather
than with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>. Shadow-stack
memory is read-only and it cannot 
be remapped. Based on the feedback from the CRIU developers, the latest
version of the kernel patches that enable shadow stacks for user space
allows passing a desired address to the <tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt> system
call. This allows CRIU to map the shadow stack of the restored processes
exactly where it was before the dump.

<p>As a result of the way CRIU recreates the process's memory layout and restores
its memory contents, mapping shadow-stack memory requires some additional
care beyond having it at the correct address. To avoid conflicts between the
memory layouts of CRIU and the restored process, CRIU reserves enough
virtual memory to hold all of the restored process's memory areas, partially
populates that memory, and then uses <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html"><tt>mremap()</tt></a>
to map chunks of the reserved area to the
appropriate addresses; it then finishes restoring the memory contents. The
remapping happens late in the restore process and, since the shadow-stack
memory cannot be remapped, it has to be created after the memory layout
is nearly finalized; otherwise <tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt> could clobber an existing
mapping.

<p>Once the shadow stack has been put into the correct place, CRIU switches
the shadow-stack pointer to it using the x86 <tt>RSTORSSP</tt> and
<tt>SAVEPREVSSP</tt> instructions.  At this point, the shadow stack can be
populated with the <tt>WRUSS</tt> instruction. After restoring the saved
shadow-stack data, CRIU uses <tt>WRUSS</tt> again to set up a frame for
<tt>sigreturn()</tt> that will later resume normal execution of the restored
tasks.
<p>

Restoring the shadow-stack contents could also be done with
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, but user-space stacks can grow quite deep; there may be
a lot of threads, and so restoring shadow-stack contents that way would
involve complex synchronization between the CRIU control process and the
tasks being restored. Additionally, filling memory with <tt>ptrace()</tt>
is terribly slow.  Although <tt>WRUSS</tt> is not as efficient as
<tt>memcpy()</tt>, it is still much faster than
<tt>ptrace()</tt>. Before using <tt>WRUSS</tt>, though, it should be
enabled in the shadow-stack control register, where it is disabled by
default. CRIU can enable <tt>WRUSS</tt> before restoring the shadow-stack
memory with an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/arch_prctl.2.html"><tt>arch_prctl()</tt></a>
call that allows manipulating bits in the shadow-stack control MSR, and
switch it back off before letting the restored tasks run.

<p>The last task that CRIU has to take care of is the locking of the
shadow-stack features. The GNU C Library (glibc) will enable shadow stacks
for a process if it finds certain bits in the ELF header of the running
program, and disables the feature if these bits are absent. Once the
shadow stack is enabled or disabled, glibc locks its state with an
<tt>arch_prctl()</tt> call. The same call allows locking the state of
<tt>WRUSS</tt> enablement but, at the moment, glibc does not use it. The
feature locks are inherited across a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
call so, if CRIU runs with shadow stacks enabled, it cannot restore a
process that has shadow stacks disabled and similarly, if CRIU starts
without the shadow stack, it has no way to enable it after
<tt>clone()</tt>ing the restored tasks.  To resolve this problem, the
proposed kernel API introduces another <tt>arch_prctl()</tt> call that will
unlock the shadow-stack features. This call is only available via
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, so an attacker won't be able to disable shadow stack
from within a process. With this <tt>arch_prctl()</tt> call, CRIU can
control the shadow-stack feature locks for the <tt>clone()</tt>ed tasks and
then reset them to the final, secure state after the shadow stack is
restored.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>Shadow stacks on the x86 architecture provide efficient protection
against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">return-oriented
programming</a> (ROP) and similar attacks, but its use necessitates updates of
certain applications. Hopefully, CRIU's experience with shadow stacks will be
useful to other projects that need to address shadow-stack compatibility
issues.

Enabling shadow stack-support in CRIU revealed several gaps in the earlier
versions of the proposed kernel APIs and the <a
href="https://github.com/rppt/criu/tree/cet/v0.1">initial
implementation</a> of shadow-stack support in CRIU relied on API extensions
that were not included in the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220130211838.8382-1-rick.p.edgecombe@intel.com/">original
kernel patches</a>.  The latest version of those patches has incorporated
feedback from the CRIU developers and has all the necessary knobs to
support checkpoint and restore of applications with shadow stacks.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This call is only available via ptrace(), so an attacker won't be able to disable shadow stack from within a process.
</blockquote>
Surely if you can call any syscall (say, if this was a new call) you can call ptrace() on yourself, and thus get access to this facility anyway? (Or, rather, the attacker can cause the process to call ptrace() on itself).
<p>
(But maybe, like many ptrace() operations, it can only be called on a seized process, in which case an attacker would have to provoke a new thread into seizing and unlocking all the others, and if an attacker can do *that* it's presumably already won.)

It creates a new mapping by injecting a call to mmap() first :) this is even documented! &lt;<a href="https://criu.org/Parasite_code">https://criu.org/Parasite_code</a>&gt;<br>

Well, no, it's not possible to answer the question "how does CRIU bootstrap code execution in the target" by "it executes mmap() first" :)<br>
<p>
I looked at the code, and it seems that code for the first syscall in the target is written to the location computed by get_exec_start() [1], which simply finds the first large enough executable (but not necessarily writable) mapping. And then I realized my mistake that lead to my original question: I assumed that PTRACE_POKEDATA uses the same page permissions that the normal user-space code does, which would make it impossible for CRIU to write code to a read-only mapping. But no, in fact, the kernel overrides the permissions [2], so code reuse "attack" is not needed for CRIU.<br>

I have never quite understood why a functionality which mainly consists of dumping all kernel data and process state to a file, and later using that for restoring, is to be done from user space.<br>
<p>
Since the kernel is in a privileged position to dump all that data, why not do It from there?<br>
<p>
Instead of defining hundreds of interfaces and tricks for extracting that info from US, why not just dump everything from KS to e.g. a netlink socket?<br>
<p>
Surely a serialization format, protocol, etc. should be designed, but is seems to me this would be easier than implementing dozens of interfaces for extracting info to US.<br>
<p>
Also since the extracted info is so tied to the kernel, Keeping the CR functionality as an integral parte of the kernel source would seem like the logical thing to do...<br>
<p>
Of course, most probably the relevant people already thought about this and decided the current way was the best instead of what I propose...<br>

Ahhh, this seems a good reason to me. Since the Linux policy is to never ever break US, you are right.<br>
<p>
The data output by the kernel with my schema should be considered an opaque blob, but It also should be examined to account for different versions, etc ... which introduces the risks you mention.<br>
<p>
I kind of get It. This seems a case where an ABI policy similar to the BSD's, where KS and US are maintained in lockstep, would make things much easier for CR features...<br>

Thanks for the point.<br>

As an additional reason against having the kernel dump the data, depending on how the kernel serializes the data, it could result in leaking struct layouts if those are randomized. I'm sure the security folks wouldn't like that.<br>

You want to dump only userspace-observable data, otherwise you'll drown in complexity at restore time<br>
not to mention restoring old programs on new kernel (which is major use case: long running program<br>
should survive kernel upgrade and continue).<br>
<p>
But if only user observable stuff is in the image, then restoring can (in theory) be done with userspace<br>
accessible interfaces only, some of which exist already (think umask(2)).<br>

Some stuff is much easier from kernelspace, true.<br>

IIRC the reason the project is called Checkpoint Restore *In Userspace* is to distinguish it from earlier attempts to do it all in the kernel, which failed. It's quite a bit ago now but if you look you can probably find the old discussions about why that approach was abandoned, by those who tried it.<br>

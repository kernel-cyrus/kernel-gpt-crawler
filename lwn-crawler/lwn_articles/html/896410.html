<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 6, 2022</br>
           </div>
The 5.19 merge window was closed with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgZt-YDSKfdyES2p6A_KJoG8DwQ0mb9CeS8jZYp+0Y2Rw@mail.gmail.com/">5.19-rc1</a>
release on June&nbsp;5 after the addition of 13,124 non-merge changesets
to the mainline 
kernel.  That makes this merge window another busy one, essentially
matching the 13,204 changesets seen for 5.18.  The approximately 8,500
changesets merged since <a href="/Articles/896140/">our first 5.19
merge-window summary</a> contain quite a bit of new functionality; read on
for a summary of the most interesting changes that were pulled during the
second half of this merge window.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The remaining 32-bit Armv4T and Armv5 systems have finally been dragged into the
     multi-platform world.  As Arnd Bergmann noted in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ecf0aa5317b0">the merge
     message</a>: "<q>This series has been 12 years in the making, it
     mostly finishes the work that was started with the founding of Linaro
     to clean up platform support in the kernel</q>".
<li> The h8300 architecture has been removed — again.  As noted in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fba2689ee77e">the merge
     message</a>, it was deleted once in 2013 and reinstated two years
     later.  Since then, it has seen almost no maintenance, so now it is
     gone again.
<li> Changes to the riscv architecture include the addition of support for
     "supervisor-mode page-based memory types" (allowing pages to be marked
     with attributes like "non-cacheable"), support for running 32-bit
     binaries on 64-bit systems, and an implementation of <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kexec_load.2.html"><tt>kexec_file_load()</tt></a>.
<li> The initial support for Loongson's "LoongArch" CPU architecture has
     been merged.
     <p>
     <blockquote class="bq">
	LoongArch is a new RISC ISA, which is a bit like MIPS or RISC-V.
  	LoongArch includes a reduced 32-bit version (LA32R), a standard
  	32-bit version (LA32S) and a 64-bit version (LA64). 
     </blockquote>
     <p>
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0ea8ce61cb2c">This documentation
     commit</a> has more information about this architecture.
<li> There is a new <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220430153626.30660-1-palmer@rivosinc.com/">generic
     ticket spinlock</a> type that can be implemented on most
     architectures that cannot support a full <a
     href="/Articles/590243/">qspinlock</a> implementation.  It is being
     used by openrisc, csky, and riscv.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> A new proactive reclaim mechanism has been merged that gives user
     space some control over working-set management.  The memory controller
     has a new control file called <tt>memory.reclaim</tt>; writing a
     number there will initiate an attempt to reclaim that many bytes from
     the indicated control group.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/94968384dde1">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The longstanding problems with copy-on-write and
     <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> have gotten a bit better with the merging of
     an extensive set of fixes; <a href="/Articles/895439/">this
     article</a> describes the changes.
<li> The kernel can better account for (and control) the use of memory when
     compressed swapping with zswap is in use; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f4840ccfca25">this changelog</a>
     for a bit more information.
<li> The kernel can now keep track of which modules (if any) tainted the
     kernel, even after those modules are unloaded.
<li> The sysctl knobs for the System V interprocess communication
     mechanisms have been reworked to be properly associated with each <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">IPC
     namespace</a>.  This paves the way toward allowing unprivileged
     processes to change them within user namespaces, but that last step
     has not yet been taken.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The fanotify mechanism implements a new flag
     (<tt>FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE</tt>) that does not pin the targeted inode in
     the inode cache.  If the inode is evicted for any reason, the
     associated mark will be lost.  The purpose of this feature appears to
     be to allow applications to mark subtrees to be ignored without
     actually pinning parts of those subtrees in the cache.
<li> The XFS filesystem has gained the ability to store billions of
     extended attributes with any given inode.  Evidently, there are people
     out there who actually want to be able to do that.  While they were in
     the neighborhood, the XFS developers raised the maximum number of
     extents per file from a measly 4&nbsp;billion to 2<sup>47</sup>.
<li> XFS has also gained a feature called "logged attribute replay"; it
     allows multiple extended attributes in a file to be modified together
     in an atomic fashion.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/babf0bb978e3">This merge
     message</a> has a bit more information about both changes.
<li> The NFS "courteous server" feature will avoid purging lock state for
     an unresponsive client for up to a day — unless some other client
     requests a contending lock.  Without this feature, an unresponsive
     client's locks will be unconditionally purged after 90 seconds.
<li> The overlayfs filesystem can now handle <a
     href="/Articles/896255/">ID-mapped mounts</a>.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The kernel's firmware loader can now handle firmware files
     that have been compressed with <a
     href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstandard</a>.  The firmware
     loader also has a new sysfs file that allows firmware loads to be initiated
     from user space; there is a bit of documentation in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/536fd8184b7d">this commit</a>.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The virtio-blk driver now supports polled I/O, an enhancement that,
     according to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4e0400525691">this
     commit message</a>, improves latency by about 10%.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> It is now possible to embed a <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/bootconfig.html">bootconfig
     file</a> directly into the kernel; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2f51efc6b71d">this documentation
     update</a> describes how.
<li> There is a new "TAI" tracing clock that produces events in <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">international
     atomic time</a>.

</ul>
<p>
All of those changes inevitably brought a lot of bugs with them; the time
has now come to try to identify and fix those problems.  Assuming that 5.19
turns out to be a normal nine or ten-week cycle (and it has been a long
time since anything else has happened), the final 5.19 kernel release will
happen on July&nbsp;24 or&nbsp;31.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I guess it wasn&#x27;t that obvious; the &quot;people out there who actually want to be able to do this&quot; are the XFS developers themselves. We need somewhere to host reverse directory lookup information (a.k.a. parent pointers) for online verification and repair purposes, to store merkle tree verification data for fsverity, etc. Why bother inventing new mechanisms to store all these new objects when you&#x27;ve already got a generic key-value store built into every inode that scales out to hundreds of millions of individual objects?<br>

AFAIK, the counter framework can report events along with a timestamp. Why create a new framework instead of adapting the existing one?<br>

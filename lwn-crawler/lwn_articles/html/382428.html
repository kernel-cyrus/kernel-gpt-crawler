<p>
Today's increasing bandwidth, and faster networking hardware, has made it
difficult for a single CPU to keep up.  Multiple cores and packages have
helped matters on the transmit side, but the receive side is trickier.  Tom
Herbert's receive packet
steering (RPS) patches, which we <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/362339/">looked</a> at back in November,
provide a way to steer packets to particular CPUs based on a hash of the
packet's protocol data.  Those patches were applied to the network subsystem
tree and are bound for 2.6.35, but now Herbert is back with an enhancement
to RPS that will attempt to steer packets to the CPU on which the receiving
application is running: <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/381955/">receive
flow steering</a> (RFS).
</p>

<p>
RFS uses the RPS hash table to store the CPU of an application when it
calls <tt>recvmsg()</tt> or <tt>sendmsg()</tt>.  Instead of picking an
arbitrary CPU based on the hash and a CPU mask optionally set by an
administrator, as RPS does, RFS tries to use the CPU where the receiving
application is running.  Based on the hash calculated on the incoming packet, RFS can look
up the "proper" CPU and assign the packet there.

<p>
The RPS CPU masks, which can be set via sysfs for each device (and
queue for devices with multiple queues), represent the allowable CPUs to
assign for a packet.  But dynamically changing those values introduces the
possibility of out-of-order packets.  For RPS, with largely static CPU
masks, it was not necessarily a big problem.  For RFS, however, multiple
threads trying to read from the same socket, while potentially bouncing
around to different CPUs, would cause the CPU value in the hash table to
change frequently, thus increasing the likelihood of out-of-order packets.
</p>

<p>
For RFS, that was considered to be a "<q>non-starter</q>", Herbert
said, so a different approach was required.  To eliminate the out-of-order
packets, two types of hash tables are created, both indexed by the hash
calculated from the packet information.  The global
<tt>rps_sock_flow_table</tt> is populated by the <tt>recvmsg()</tt> or
<tt>sendmsg()</tt> call with the CPU number where the application is running
(this is called the "desired" CPU).
Each device queue then gets a <tt>rps_dev_flow_table</tt> which contains
the most recent CPU used to handle packets for that connection (which is
called the "current" CPU).  In addition, the value of the tail queue
counter for the current CPU's backlog queue is stored in the
<tt>rps_dev_flow_table</tt> entry.
</p>

<p>
The two CPU values are compared when deciding which CPU to process the
packet on (which is done in <tt>get_rps_cpu()</tt>).  If the current CPU
(as determined from the <tt>rps_dev_flow_table</tt> hash table) is
unset (presumably for the first packet) or that CPU is offline, the desired
CPU (from <tt>rps_sock_flow_table</tt>) is used.  If the two CPU values are
the same, obviously, that CPU is used.  But if they are both valid CPU
numbers, but different, the backlog tail queue counter is consulted.
</p>

<p>
Backlog queues have a queue head counter that gets incremented when packets
are removed from the queue.  Using that and the queue length, a queue tail
counter value can be calculated.  That is what gets stored in
<tt>rps_dev_flow_table</tt>.  When the kernel makes its decision about
which CPU to assign the packet to, it needs to consider both the current
(really last used by the kernel) CPU and the desired (last used by an
application for sending or receiving) CPU.  
</p>

<p>
The kernel compares the current CPU's queue tail counter (as stored in the
hash table) with that CPU's queue head counter. If the tail counter is less
than or equal the head counter, 
that means that all packets that were put on the queue by this connection
have been processed.  That in turn means that switching to the desired CPU
will not result in out-of-order packets.
</p>

<p>
Herbert's current patch is for TCP, but RFS should be "<q>usable for other
flow oriented protocols</q>".  The benefit is that it can achieve better
CPU locality for the processing of the packet, both by the kernel, and the
application itself.  Depending on various factors&mdash;cache hierarchy and
application are given as examples&mdash;it can and does increase the
packets per second that can be processed as well as lowering the latency
before a packet gets processed.  But, interestingly, "<q>on simple
benchmarks, we don't necessarily see improvement and sometimes see degradation</q>".
</p>

<p>
For more complex benchmarks, the performance increase looks to be
significant.  Herbert gave numbers for a netperf run where the transactions
per second went from 104K without either RFS or RPS, to 290K for the best
RPS configuration, and to 303K with RFS and RPS.  A different test, with
100 threads handling an RPC-like request/response with some user-space work
being done, was even more dramatic.  That test showed 103K, 174K, and 223K
respectively, but also showed a marked decrease in the latency for both
RPS and RPS + RFS.
</p>

<p>
These patches are coming from Google, which has been known to process a
few packets using the Linux kernel.  If RFS is being used on production
systems at Google, that would seem to bode well for its reliability and
performance beyond just benchmarks.  The patches were posted April 2, and
seemed to be generally well-received, so it's a little early to tell when
they might make it into the mainline.  But it seems rather likely that we
will see them in either 2.6.35 or 36.

Wouldn't this cause problems for single-threaded applications? Could the packet receiver thread repeatedly push the actual process to a different processor like this:<br>
<p>
1. Daemon gets scheduled to processor A<br>
2. All incoming packets are steered to processor A<br>
3. Processor gets loaded due to processing of incoming packets<br>
4. Scheduler decides that the daemon could get more work done and reschedules it to processor B<br>
5. Repeat<br>
<p>
So the daemon and packet processing thread would be playing cat-and-mouse and repeatedly jumping through different processors.<br>
<p>
I guess for just plain TCP, the processing overhead can be quite low, but if you add iptables processing, packet capturing etc, it can become significant.<br>

It completely depends on your hardware, and how your application works.<br>
<p>
watch -n1 cat /proc/interrupts<br>
<p>
Look for the line that says "Rescheduling interrupts". If your apps are loading up with some sort of io such as sssd block io or very fast network io, the scheduler tends to flip out. Thats causes your app to slow down due to being rescheduled. The solution is to setup the affinity of your block devices, network cards, or applications.<br>
<p>
In short... depending on your hardware and applications, it can still very much be an issue.<br>

If what you said is true, the similar thing will still happen to a single process without rps/rfs or even network. <br>
<p>
1. Daemon gets scheduled to processor A<br>
2. processor A get very busy.<br>
3. Scheduler decides that the daemon could get more work done and reschedules it to processor B<br>
4. Repeat<br>
<p>
So I think the scheduler should already have some methods to detect and prevent such thrashing.<br>

What is the true benefit of RFS vs RPS. In the kernel documentation section, I see that the author talks about data cache hitrate, I am trying to understand what this really means and how this would be truly beneficial over RPS. Any leads here would be helpful. Thanks <br>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 12, 2013</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2013-LinuxCon_Japan">LinuxCon Japan 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
At <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-japan">LinuxCon
Japan</a>, Yasuaki Ishimatsu of Fujitsu talked about the status of memory
hotplug, with a focus on what still needs to be done to fully support both
hot adding and hot removing memory.  If a memory device is broken in a
laptop or desktop, you can just replace that memory, but for servers, especially
ones that need to stay running, it is more difficult.  In addition,
having a way to add and remove memory would allow for dynamic
reconfiguration on systems where the hardware has been partitioned into two
or more virtual machines.
</p>

<p>
The focus of the memory hotplug work is for both scenarios: broken memory
hardware and dynamic reconfiguration.  Memory hotplug will be supported in
KVM, Ishimatsu said.  It is currently supported by several operating
systems, but Linux does not completely support it yet.  Fixing that is the
focus this work.
</p>

<p>
There are two phases to memory hotplug: physically adding or removing
memory (hot add or hot remove) and logically changing the amount of memory
available to the system (onlining or offlining memory).  Both phases have
to be completed before Linux can use any new memory, and taking the memory
offline (so that Linux is no longer using it) is required before it can be
removed.
</p>

<p>
The memory management subsystem manages physical memory by using two
structures, he said.  The page tables hold a direct mapping for virtual to
physical addresses.  The virtual memory map manages page structures.  In
order to offline memory, any data needs to be moved out of the memory and
those data structures need to be updated.  Likewise, when adding memory, 
new page table and 
virtual memory map entries must be added.
</p>

<p>
Pages are managed in zones and, when using the sparse memory model that is
needed for memory hotplug systems, zones are broken up into sections that are
128M in size.  Sections can be switched from online to offline and vice
versa using the <tt>/sys/devices/system/memory/memoryX/state</tt> file.  By
echoing <tt>offline</tt> or <tt>online</tt> into that file, the pages in
that section have their state changed to unusable or usable respectively.
</p>

<p>
In the 3.2 kernel, hot adding memory and onlining it were fully
supported.  Offlining memory was supported with limitations, and hot
removing it was not supported at all.  Work started in July 2012 to remove
the offline limitations and to add support for hot remove, Ishimatsu said.
</p>

<p>
The work for hot remove has been merged for the 3.9 kernel.  It will invalidate
page table and virtual memory map entries that correspond to the memory
being removed.  But, since the memory must be taken offline before it is
removed, the limitations on memory offline still make it impossible to
remove arbitrary memory hardware from the system.
</p>

<p>
When memory that is to be offlined has data in it, that data is migrated to
other memory in the system.  But the only pages that are migratable this
way are the page cache and anonymous pages, which are known as "movable"
pages.  If the memory contains non-movable memory, which Ishimatsu called
"kernel memory", 
the section cannot be offlined.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to handle that problem that are being considered.  The
first is to support moving kernel memory when offlining pages 
that contain it.  The advantages to that are that all memory can be
offlined and there is no additional performance impact for NUMA systems
since there are no restrictions on the types of allocations that can be
made.  On the 
downside, though, the kernel physical to virtual address relationship will
need to change completely.  The other alternative is to make all of a
node's memory movable, which would reuse the existing movable memory
feature, but means that only page cache and anonymous pages can be stored
there, which will impact the performance of that NUMA node.
</p>

<p>
Ishimatsu said that he prefers the first solution personally, but, as a
first step they are implementing the second: creating a node that consists
only of movable memory.  Linux has the idea of a movable zone
(i.e. <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt>), but zones of that type are not created
automatically.  If a node consists only of movable memory, all of it can be
migrated elsewhere so that the node can be taken offline.
</p>

<p>
A new boot option, <tt>movablecore=acpi</tt>, is under development that will use
the memory affinity structure in the ACPI static resource affinity table
(SRAT) to choose which nodes will 
be constructed of movable memory.  The existing use for
<tt>movablecore</tt> allows setting aside a certain amount of memory that
will be 
movable in the system, but it spreads it evenly across all of the nodes
rather than concentrating it only on the nodes of interest.  The "hotpluggable"
bit for a node in the SRAT will be used to choose the target nodes in the
new mode. 
</p>

<p>
Using the <tt>online_movable</tt> flag to the sysfs memory <tt>state</tt>
file (rather than just <tt>online</tt>) allows an administrator to tell the
system to make that memory movable.  Without that, the onlined memory is
treated as <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>, so it may contain kernel memory and thus
not be able to be offlined.  The <tt>online_movable</tt> feature was merged
for 3.8.  That reduces the limitations on taking memory offline, but there
is still work to do.
</p>

<p>
Beyond adding the <tt>movablecore=acpi</tt> boot option (and possibly a
<tt>vm.hotadd_memory_treat_as_movable</tt> sysctl), there are some other
plans.  Finding a way to put the page tables and virtual memory map into the
hot-added memory is something Ishimatsu would like to see, because it would
help performance on that node, but would not allow that memory to be
offlined unless those data structures can be moved.  He is thinking about
solutions for 
that.  Migrating <tt>vmalloc()</tt> data to other nodes when offlining a
node is another feature under consideration.

<p>
Eventually, being able to migrate any kernel memory out of a node is
something he would like to see, but solutions to that problem are still somewhat
elusive.  He encouraged those in attendance to participate in the
discussions and to help find solutions for these problems.

Another potential use for hotpluggable memory which has been pointed out here now and then is to speed up boot for machines with lots of ECCRAM (generally servers, but in my ideal world every machine would use ECCRAM exclusively, and in the end increasing RAM volumes may make it essential). Right now, the more ECCRAM you've got, the slower the machine boots, because it has to initialize all that RAM at bootup, which is constrained by CPU-&gt;RAM speeds, which remain relatively low and are scaling more slowly than RAM size. The 24Gb ECCRAM in my relatively small server takes about 30s to initialize, and I've heard of machines that take 15 minutes.<br>
<p>
What if the BIOS could be told to initialize only, say, 1Gb of it, and then hand the rest off to the OS, which could initialize the remaining memory in the background after booting and hotplug it in when it's ready? The boot time suddenly stops getting worse and worse, and the cost (a machine that starts with relatively little memory and gains more as it goes) is harmless because by definition you could never fill the RAM faster than it's being initialized anyway, since that initialization is constrained by the CPU-&gt;RAM interconnect speed.<br>
<p>
But obviously before anyone could implement this scheme memory hotplug needs to work!<br>

says that any PC3-* bandwidth is over 10 GBytes/s, and 24 Gb shall be less than 2.4 seconds at max CPU-&gt;RAM speeds.<br>
Your CPU is probably busy doing something else, and the PC lacks a good DMA to handle this kind of low level tasks.<br>

This is DDR3-1066. 8GiB/s. So, yes, it should take only a couple of seconds, if it were physically possible to write to RAM that fast. It isn't: just the CAS switches between all those cells would take longer than that. (Sure, perhaps this should be done by the memory controller, in parallel, since 'initialize to a known state' shouldn't actually require umpty Gb of data to be transferred as long as all the RAM agreed on what that known state was. But that requires substantial hardware changes and standard changes to agree on the known state, much harder than a mere firmware change, in theory anyway...)<br>

you are mixing up the time needed to initialize the RAM and the time needed to do tests on the RAM.<br>
<p>
Every BIOS I've seen has a setting that will let you bypass the detailed memory tests at boot time.<br>
<p>
Very few people boot their systems frequently enough to bother changing this setting through.<br>

Because he has ECC RAM he needs to write it once to initialise the ECC bits.<br>
Well, theoretically no memory should be read before being written, but in practice someone may do it (obviously in another OS, never happen on Linux).<br>
In linux, if you get an ECC error, you directly assume the RAM is faulty, not that some area is read before being written.<br>

right, but even on servers with 128G of ram that I have, this only takes a few seconds (and I suspect that a noticeable chunk of the time is spent updating the display to report progress :-)<br>

nowhere near the several minute figures mentioned above.<br>

It's not doing a memory check, that takes ages and I turned it off.<br>
<p>
But it is quite true that BIOSes are so opaque (and so badly written) that it could very well be spending its time doing something else, probably terribly inefficiently!<br>
<p>
But, still, the 'need to write everything' and the ever reducing ratio of memory bandwidth to RAM volume *is* eventually going to have the effects I suggest above, even if it isn't now. So it's good that Linux already has the machinery necessary to fix it, if the BIOSes would please catch up. (Actually, looking at the article more closely it had this from 3.2 or thereabouts, since all this needs is plugging, not unplugging.)<br>

<p>
Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.
</p>

<p>
The overall concept of copy offload is that you issue a command to a device
and it copies the data from one place on the device to another, though the copy
can also be between NVMe 
namespaces on a device.  The advantages are in saving CPU resources, PCI
bandwidth, and, on fabrics, network bandwidth, because the copy stays local
to the device.  The first
approach was <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/1401335565-29865-1-git-send-email-martin.petersen@oracle.com/">from Martin Petersen</a> in 2014, which 
was <tt>ioctl()</tt>-based; another, which was based on using two BIOs, was
<a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/alpine.LRH.2.02.1512101145430.25927@file01.intranet.prod.int.rdu2.redhat.com/">developed
by Mikulas Patocka</a> in 2015.  The <tt>ioctl()</tt> approach had problems
with scalability, Shetty said.  Petocka's approach was compatible with the
device mapper, but neither of the two patch sets gained any traction in the
community. 
</p>

alt="[Nitesh Shetty]" title="Nitesh Shetty" width=224 height=270>
</a>

<p>
In 2021, Shetty and his colleagues restarted the effort; they discussed it in
a <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nvme/20211116134324.hbs3tp5proxootd7@ArmHalley.localdomain/">conference
call</a> that came out of LSFMM planning process, since the summit was not
held that year.  There were numerous complaints about the lack of
any way to test copy offload in that call, so they worked on testing
infrastructure, which was presented at the LSFMM+BPF summit in&nbsp;2022.
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230419114320.13674-1-nj.shetty@samsung.com/">patch
set</a> was at version&nbsp;10 at the time of this year's summit; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230605121732.28468-1-nj.shetty@samsung.com/">version&nbsp;12</a>
was posted on June&nbsp;5.
Shetty said that he wanted to discuss what was needed in order for the
patches to 
get merged.  
</p>

<p>
He described the current status.  The user-space interface for copy offload
is the <a 
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/copy_file_range.2.html"><tt>copy_file_range()</tt>
system call</a>; if the device can perform the copy-offload operation, the block
layer will request that, otherwise the system call will copy the data
through the host as is done now.   In the copy-offload case, two BIOs get
created, 
one for read and the other for write of the range of interest; those get
combined into a copy-offload operation sent to the device.  There is an
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230605121732.28468-4-nj.shetty@samsung.com/">emulation
for devices where offload is not available</a>; that emulation 
performs much better than regular read-then-write copies, he said.  
</p>

<p>
The
block-layer support can use the SCSI XCOPY or Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX)
copy-offload commands;
when NVMe cross-namespace copy 
offload becomes available, that can be supported as well.  Testing can be
done using QEMU devices or the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/block/null_blk.html">null block device</a>;
the <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio">fio</a> tests and the <a
href="https://github.com/osandov/blktests">blktests</a> framework can both
be used for that testing. 
</p>

<p>
For Linux 6.5, they would like to get the basic support for copy offload
upstream. That includes the block-layer pieces and the support in
<tt>copy_file_range()</tt>.  The only device mapper target that it will
support is <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/linear.html">dm-linear</a>
but there are plans to add support for other targets in subsequent
releases.  They would like to get a sense from the community if what they
are doing is on the right path or if there are changes needed before it can
start going upstream, Shetty said.
Damien Le Moal wondered what was special about dm-linear, but Shetty said
that was just an easy target to add and test; they did not want to get code
in that would immediately break, so working with dm-linear was expedient.
</p>

<p>
Petersen said that he took another look at the patch set that morning; his
earlier objections have been addressed, so he thinks it looks to be in
reasonable shape for going upstream.  He had two questions, not objections
he stressed; the first is that one use case that was targeted by the early
efforts was garbage collection on zoned-storage devices
and the like.  That required performing copies from multiple sources to a single
destination, but he has not heard any clamor for that use case in a long
time; "is this still a target?"  Le Moal said that it was, there are
multiple places where it would be used.  Another attendee agreed, but said
they strongly believed it should not be part of the first round of
functionality. 
</p>

<p>
Hannes Reinecke said that copy offload has been in limbo because the
use cases, implementation in the kernel, and support in the hardware never
really aligned.  Petersen said that it has been moving target as well; the
earliest use case was for provisioning virtual machines (VMs) from a golden
image, then it changed to the garbage-collection use case, but now seems to
be headed back to the original use case.  That is why the older patch sets,
which are what Shetty and colleagues have used as a base, still work;
Petersen said that the current work looks fine to him and Reinecke agreed.
</p>

<p>
Petersen's second question was about establishing whether two storage
devices can even talk to each other; the two devices may both report that
they support copy offload, but that does not necessarily mean copy offload
can be done 
between them.  There are similar problems for NVMe, he said, but the tests
in the code do not stop the system from falling into this hole.  For the
NVMe case, he said that the check should be that the source and destination
are both on the same block device; for SCSI, he will wire up a similar test
for both the XCOPY and token-based copy offload paths.
</p>

<p>
Le Moal agreed that, for now, copy offload should be restricted to a single
device.  There is a cost to going down the copy-offload path, Petersen
said, so it should not be done if it is likely to fail.  Shetty seemed to
think that was perhaps being too restrictive, but Le Moal and Petersen were
adamant that the first cut at the feature ignore any other possibilities
until better heuristics for when copy offload will succeed can be developed.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that he noted "NVMe fabrics" on the slides; he has seen it
elsewhere and wondered if
that was just "slideware" or if there are actual products where NVMe
devices can talk to each other over the network to do copy offload.  "Is
that in fact something that people care about today?"  Petersen said that
SCSI and, soon, NVMe have the ability to express that kind of relationship
between devices.  While the SCSI protocol has that ability, Fred Knight
said that he is 
unaware of anyone in the world who has actually implemented it. NVMe has
not added it to its protocol, at least yet;  you can only do copies between
namespaces within the same subsystem.
</p>

<p>
Shetty said that there was a distinct lack of Reviewed-by tags for the
block-layer changes; those tags would be needed before the code can be merged.
Petersen committed to adding those tags and also to adding the SCSI pieces
to the feature.  Shetty also wondered about agreement on the plumbing
changes for 
<tt>copy_file_range()</tt>;  Christian Brauner said that he needed some
more time to review.  Shetty wrapped up the session by noting there are
some additional features that are planned, but the first step is to get the
basics merged, which he is hopeful can happen for&nbsp;6.5.

      <p>Cross-device is possible in theory, but not in practice.
<p>The current use cases are deep-copying an LVM volume or equivalent for a virtual machine, and doing the data copy part of garbage collection on a zoned storage device without copying the data off the device and back on.

Cloud virtualized disks, and generally any networked block devices seem like an obvious candidate for a late joining use case with huge perf wins. Sending an XCOPY over your network connection saves a lot of network bandwidth which is your most constrained pipe. Clustered filesystems like Ceph can probably do a triangle copy, where host A asks host B to send data to host C.<br>

Note that hardware copy offload is fundamentally incompatible with commonly-used configurations of dm-crypt or other full-disk encryption schemes, because each sector's ciphertext is "tweaked" using the storage device sector number. Copying a given piece of plaintext from one sector to another results in a different ciphertext.<br>

Isn’t RAID the obvious place to use this functionality? If you add a new disk to your array and its contents must be copied from an existing disk, that can happen by copying directly across the SCSI bus or whatever. <br>

For e.g. RAID5/RAID6 you would need to recalculate parity when adding a disk, in which case it would make more sense to use a traditional copy so the CPU can access the data.  For RAID0/RAID1/RAID10 it might work to do a direct device to device copy.<br>

I was thinking that even in RAID5 or RAID6 you might get an alert that a certain disk is about to fail.  At that point you add a new disk to the array and tell it to become a copy of the failing disk, so for a transition period the same data is stored on two disks.  (Effectively one of the underlying disks of the array has become its own little RAID1, you might say.)  Then once the new disk is online and up to date the unhealthy disk can be removed from the array.<br>

That wouldn't work if the underlying disk has actually failed, you would have to properly rebuild the array in that case, but if the diagnostics give you advance warning then this kind of "soft replacement" is faster and safer than just removing the old disk and adding a new one to be rebuilt from scratch.<br>

You actually brought a good question. What are guarantees for xcopy and similar in case of crashes or power failures? Is it copied all-or-nothing? Can it be a partial copy? It it's partial copy, is is from offset 0 to N or is it from offset N to M (e.g. only last 4 sectors out of 16)? What if one sector out of 16 is not readable? What if target sector is not writable?<br>

LWN.net <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2007/">Kernel Summit 2007</a> coverage
</div>
<p>
The kernel summit session on memory management was led by Mel Gorman and
Peter Zijlstra.  While the VM hackers have a lot going on, this session was
dominated by three topics: large page support, test cases, and memory
pressure notification.
<p>

There continues to be pressure for improved large-page support on Linux
systems.  For almost any architecture, proper use of large pages can help
to relieve pressure on the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), with a
corresponding increase in performance.  Some architectures (SuperH, for
example) have very small TLBs and, thus, a large motivation to use large
pages whenever possible.  This would be easier to do if Linux could support
more than one size of large pages.  Some processors have several different
size options, some up to 1GB.
<p>

Large pages are currently made available via hugetlbfs, an interface which
application developers have, in general, not yet learned to love.
Hugetlbfs currently only provides a single size of large pages, so
providing multiple page sizes will require an extension to this virtual
filesystem.  Initially, an extension might take a relatively rudimentary
form, such as a mount-time page size option.  Multiple sizes could then be
accommodated by mounting hugetlbfs multiple times.
<p>

There are challenges involved in supporting some of these page sizes,
though.  1GB pages are currently larger than <tt>MAX_ORDER</tt>, the
largest chunk of contiguous (small) pages that the kernel tracks.
Increasing <tt>MAX_ORDER</tt> is a bit more work than just changing a
definition somewhere.  Different sizes of pages also have to be established
at different levels in the page table hierarchy, something which is not
currently well supported by the kernel's page table API.

Linus cut short discussion on API issues, though, warning against any
attempts to generalize the generic API for all of the large page issues.
So much of this problem is so incredibly architecture-specific that trying
to solve it in generic code is likely to lead to bigger messes than it
solves.  So much of the work for large-page support will probably have to
be done in architecture-specific code.
<p>

Mel spent much of the session trying to get the larger group to agree on
what a proper test case for memory management patches is.  Or, even if they
wouldn't agree, to just get some suggestions for what could be a good test
case.  It would appear that he has grown just a little bit weary of being
told that his patches need to be benchmarked on a real test case before
they can be considered for inclusion.  He seems willing to do that
benchmarking, but, so far, nobody has stepped forward and told him what
kind of "real workload" they are expecting him to use.  
<p>

He got little satisfaction at the summit.  The problem is that some kinds
of workloads are relatively easy to benchmark, but other kinds of
parameters ("interactivity") are hard to measure.  So, even if somebody
could put together in implementation of (say) swap prefetch, there is no
real way to prove that it is actually useful.  And, in the absence of such
proof, memory management patches are notoriously hard to merge.  There were
not a whole lot of ideas for improving the situation.  Your editor can say,
though, that he will go out of his way not to be the next reviewer to ask Mel
about which real workloads he has tested a patch on.
<p>

The final topic was working out a way to let applications help when the
system is under memory pressure.  Web browsers, for example, often maintain
large in-memory caches which can be dropped if the system finds itself
running out of memory - but that will only happen if the browser knows
about the problem.  There are other applications in a similar situation;
GNOME and KDE applications, for example, tend to carry a certain amount of
cached data which can be done without if the need arises.
<p>

The problem is figuring out how to tell the application that the time has
come to free up some memory.  Sending a signal might be an obvious way to
send a notification, but nobody really wants to extend the signal
interface.  Responses to memory pressure notifications must often be done
in libraries, and working with signals in library code is especially
problematic.  In the absence of signals, there will have to be a way for
applications to somehow ask about memory pressure.
<p>

After a brief digression into the rarefied, philosophical question of just
what is memory pressure in the first place, the discussion wandered into a
different approach to the problem.  Perhaps an application could make a
system call to indicate that it does not currently need a specific range of
memory, but, if the system doesn't mind, keeping it around might just be
useful.  If, at some future point, the application wants something that it
had cached, it makes another call to query whether the given range of
memory is still there. This would give the kernel a list of pages it could
dump if it finds itself in a tight spot, but still keeps the data around if
there is not a pressing need for that memory.
<p>

Linus cautioned that these system calls might seem like a nice idea, but
that nobody would ever use them.  In general, he says, Linux-specific
extensions tend not be used.  Developers do not want to maintain any more
system-specific code than they really have to.  Some people thought that
there might be motivation for a few library developers to use these calls,
though.  But until such a time as a patch implementing them actually exists, 
this discussion will probably not go a whole lot further.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The claim is that application developers will tend to avoid application notification of low memory conditions as it would be a Linux-specific extension. This is only an issue in situations where an application is targeted to multiple operating systems. In the embedded world, user-mode software tends to be more closely tied to the operating system. In addition, many embedded applications need the benefit of keeping around cached data as their network connections tend to be slower. As a result, I've already been toying with the notion of designing a framework for user mode software to return memory to the kernel on demand. I doubt I'm alone in this...and I certainly don't want to support it all myself...<br>

      I think in Nokia internet tablets there's a notification about low memory <br>
situations to applications through system D-BUS broadcasts[1].  Delivering <br>
information with D-BUS messages has obviously a latency issue if <br>
application is gobbling memory very fast, but I guess it works acceptably.<br>

<p>
Btw. I think for applications which keep large freeable memory caches i.e. <br>
have a very active and complex memory allocation schemes, (Glibc) heap <br>
fragmentation is at least as large problem as getting rid of their caches. <br>
The caches should at least be large enough that their allocations have <br>
been memory mapped (&gt;= 128KB is the Glibc default) instead of coming from <br>
heap and therefore they are returned back to system immediately when they <br>
are freed, but with heap fragmentation you can only hope that allocation <br>
re-ordering helps (after you've analyzed which allocations are the <br>
problem).<br>

      The glibc mmap threshold *minimum* is 128Kb. In recent versions of glibc <br>
the threshold is dynamically adjusted between 128Kb and 512Kb (on 32-bit <br>
boxes) and 64Mb (on 64-bit). (The mmap threshold starts at 128Kb and rises <br>
whenever the application frees mmap()ed memory, so that transient <br>
allocations tend to use brk() instead.)<br>

<p>
Can you still limit that to be smaller with MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_  <br>
environment variable?  This would indicate that the limit just increases <br>
and never decreases, regardless of the environment variable:<br>

However, in some environments and with some applications, the memory <br>
fragmentation is actually worse problem than some performance decrease. If <br>
a device (e.g. an embedded one where you cannot just add more RAM) runs <br>
out of memory because of heap fragmentation, that's going to have much <br>
more drastic effect on performance than e.g. threading scalability <br>

      MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_ still works: it's precisely equivalent to calling <br>
mallopt (M_MMAP_THRESHOLD, ...); setting any of these mmap parameters <br>

<p>
Does any system currently offer a weak_free call?  Sometimes Linux has to be the first to do something.  Like FUSE, a pretty notable success.  (I know Fuse wasn't the first userspace FS...  it's the first general purpose API, though, developed on Linux at first and now being adopted by other OSes).<br>
<p>
I can understand why weak_free isn't so attractive on desktop systems where stale data is just paged to disk but it seems really handy on smaller systems: MP3 players, video players, phones, etc.  Like vomlehn says.<br>
<p>
Shame I don't have time to write the patch.  All I can do is say that, yes, I would indeed use it if it existed.<br>

      FUSE is a bit different story.  I don't need to patch Firefox and Emacs to use files in a FUSE filesystem.  I do need to patch every large-memory-footprint application to use the proposed memory-pressure message interface.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, HURD does its paging in user-space as I recall.  Ah yes:<br>

      The user space pager came from Mach.  And may have come from someone else before that.<br>
<p>
I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't a Mach kernel hacker who has written his own Mach pager.  This was an attempt to convince Mach to play better with CMU Common Lisp.<br>

      <font class="QuotedText">&gt; Does any system currently offer a weak_free call?</font><br>
<p>
How about madvise(2)?<br>
<p>
"MADV_FREE - Gives the VM system the freedom to free pages, and tells the system that information in the specified page range is no longer important. This is an efficient way of allowing malloc(3) to free pages anywhere in the address space, while keeping the address space valid. The next time that the page is referenced, the page might be demand zeroed, or might contain the data that was there before the MADV_FREE call. References made to that address space range will not make the VM system page the information back in from backing store until the page is modified again."<br>

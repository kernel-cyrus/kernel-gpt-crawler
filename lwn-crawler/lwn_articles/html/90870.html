<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="/Articles/28092/">generic DMA layer</a> provides a way for
device drivers to allocate and work with direct memory access regions
without regard for how the underlying hardware does things.  This interface
works well, for the most part, but, as with the rest of the kernel,
occasional issues come up.  Here's a few that were discussed over the last
week.
<p>

Many devices can perform full 64-bit DMA operations.  This capability is
nice on large-memory systems, but working with larger addresses can also
bring a performance penalty.  As a way of helping drivers pick the optimal
size for DMA address descriptors, James Bottomley has <a
href="/Articles/89971/">proposed</a> the creation of a new function called
<tt>dma_get_required_mask()</tt>.  
<p>
The current API already has <tt>dma_set_mask()</tt>, which tells the kernel
about the range of DMA addresses the device can access.  The new function
would be called after an invocation of <tt>dma_set_mask()</tt>; it would
return a new bitmask describing what the platform sees as the optimal set
of DMA addresses, taking the device's original DMA mask into account.  If
the specific hardware situation does not require the 
use of larger addresses, the platform can suggest using the faster, 32-bit
mode even when the device can handle larger addresses.  The driver can then
use that advice to set a new mask describing what it will actually use.
<p>


The "scatterlist" mechanism is another part of the DMA subsystem; it allows
drivers to set up scatter/gather I/O, where the buffer to be transferred is
split into multiple, distinct chunks of memory.  Scatter/gather is useful
in a number of situations, including network packets (which are assembled
from multiple chunks), the <tt>readv()</tt> and <tt>writev()</tt> system
calls, and for I/O directly to or from user-space buffers, which can be
spread out in physical memory.  The mapping functions for scatter/gather
I/O will coalesce pieces of the buffer which turn out to be physically
adjacent in memory.  In practice, that has turned out not to happen very
often; one recent <a href="/Articles/90876/">report</a> showed that, out of
approximately 32,000 segments, all of 40 had been merged in this manner.
<p>
It turns out, however, that the Linux memory allocator is not helping the
situation.  When the allocator breaks up a large block of pages to satisfy
smaller requests (a frequent occurrence), it returns the highest page in
the block.  A series of allocations will, thus, obtain pages in descending
order.  If those pages are assembled into an I/O buffer, each page will
need to be a separate segment in a scatter/gather operation, since the
reverse-allocated pages cannot be merged.
<p>
William Lee Irwin put together <a href="/Articles/90877/">a patch</a> which
causes the allocator to hand out pages from the bottom of a block instead
of the top.  With 
this patch applied, the merge rate in this particular test went up to over
55%.  Larger segments lead to faster I/O setup and execution, which is a
good thing.  Sometimes a tiny patch can make a big difference, once you
know where the problem is.

<p>

Meanwhile, Ian Molton <a href="/Articles/90878/">turned up</a> a different
sort of problem.  Some types of interfaces have their own onboard memory.
This memory is, often, accessible to the CPU, and it can be used by devices
attached to the interface for DMA operations.  But that memory is not part
of the regular system RAM, and it typically does not show up in the system
memory map.  As a result, the generic DMA functions will not make use of
this memory when allocating DMA buffers.
<p>

It would be nice to be able to make use of this memory, however.  It is
there, and it can be used to offload some DMA buffers from main memory.  On
some systems, it may be the only memory which is usable for DMA operations
to certain devices.  The DMA API has even been set up with this sort of
memory in mind; it can handle cases where, for example, the memory in
question has a different address from the device's point of view than it
does for the processor.  It would seem that the addition of an
architecture-specific module to the DMA API could enable such memory to be
allocated on platforms which have it, when the DMA target is a device
which can make use of it.
<p>

The biggest problem would appear to be that this sort of remote memory is
not part of the system's memory map, and, thus, there is no <tt>struct
page</tt> structure which describes it.  The lack of a <tt>page</tt>
structure makes certain macros fail.  It also completely breaks any driver
which tries to map the buffer into user space via the <tt>nopage()</tt> VMA
operation.  And, it turns out, drivers really do that; the ALSA subsystem,
for example, maps buffers to user space in this manner.
<p>
Once a problem is identified, it can usually be fixed.  The right approach in this
case would appear to be a combination of two things.  The first is to
simply fix any bad assumptions in drivers with regard to how they can treat
DMA buffers.  If the driver expects that a <tt>page</tt> structure exists
for a DMA buffer, it is broken and simply needs to be fixed.  The second
part is to provide an architecture-independent
way for device drivers to map DMA buffers into user space.
<p>
To that end, Russell King has <a href="/Articles/90880/">proposed</a> yet
another DMA API function:
<p>
<pre>
    int dma_map_coherent(struct device *dev, 
                         struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                         void *cpu_addr,
                         dma_addr_t handle,
                         size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
This function would take the given mapped DMA buffer (as described by
<tt>cpu_addr</tt> and <tt>handle</tt>) and map it into the requested VMA.
Device drivers could use this function to make a buffer available to user
space, and would be able to discard their existing <tt>nopage()</tt>
methods.  The new interface would thus simplify things, though it does
still leave a reference counting problem on the driver side of things:
freeing the DMA buffer before user space has unmapped it would be a big
mistake.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

How does the CPU access this memory? Via the data bus?
What addresses does it use -- and aren't all the valid
addresses refering to the RAM?

      Wouldn't a graphics card be the best known of these?  I haven't read the <br>main article as I'm just skimming them now to come back to later (after <br>some sleep, when I can make better sense of them &lt;g&gt;), so I don't know if <br>that fits in the context or not, but it's immediately what *I* think of <br>when I think of an interface with its own memory. <br> <br>Duncan <br>

      Check out Ian's email - the chip memory is in the CPU I/O address space.   <br>If it accessible in the PCI or AGP space, it would show up in the CPU  <br>memory space.  <br>  <br>What I'm wondering now is how such chips have been used by drivers in the  <br>past.  My guess is that there were alternatives to using the I/O space,  <br>or they didn't use DMA.  In this case, the chip *must* DMA from its own  <br>internal memory, and hence forced this enhancement.  <br>

      For the devices for which Ian and I are writing drivers, the CPU accesses the device's internal memory via the CPU memory bus.  On other platforms, the CPU might access the internal memory via an IO bus.  The new DMA calls proposed by James Bottomley (dma_declare_coherent_memory and dma_release_coherent_memory) handle either case.<p>Many drivers for such devices used ioremap and private memory allocators.  What caused us to propose this change was the use of standard device hardware interfaces (UCB OHCI) in the context of a chip with direct access only to private SRAM.  In the past, we made extensive modifications to drivers such as the USB OHCI driver to support these devices.  However, it appeared that the 2.6 device model and the generic DMA API would enable us to clean this up and to produce drivers acceptable to the mainstream kernel.

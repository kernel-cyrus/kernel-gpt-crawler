The read-copy-update (RCU) mechanism is charged with keeping old versions
of data
structures around until it knows that no CPU can hold a reference to them;
once that happens, the structures can be freed.  Recently, though, a
potential RCU user came forward with a request for something different:
would it be possible to defer the destruction of an old data structure
until it is known that no <i>process</i> holds a reference to it?  The
answer would appear to be "yes," as demonstrated by the <a
href="/Articles/606959/">RCU-tasks subsystem</a> recently posted by Paul
McKenney.
<p>

Normal RCU works on data structures that are accessed via a pointer.  When
an RCU-protected structure must change, the code that maintains that
structure starts by making a copy.  The changes are made to the copy, then
the relevant pointer is changed to point to that new copy.  At this point,
the old version is inaccessible, but there may be code running that
obtained a pointer to it before the change was made.  So the old structure
cannot yet be freed.  Instead, RCU waits until every CPU in the system goes
through a context switch (or sits idle).  Since the rules for RCU say that
references to data structures can only be held in atomic context, the
"every CPU has context switched" condition guarantees that no references
to an old data structure can be held.
<p>
It seems that the rules for the trampolines used by the tracing code are
different, though, in that a process can be preempted while still holding a
reference to (i.e. running within) an old version.  Given that, normal RCU
will not work for the 
management of these structures, meaning that some other, slower locking
mechanism must be used.  Using an RCU-like mechanism would require that the
rules be changed somewhat.
<p>

In the normal RCU case, only one process can hold a reference to a
protected structure on any given CPU; as a result, RCU focuses on figuring
out when no CPU can hold a reference to a given data structure.  In this
case, there might be multiple processes on each CPU with a reference to the
protected data structure, so the focus has to shift.  Thus, RCU-tasks is a
mechanism designed to figure out when no processes (rather than no
processors) can hold such a reference.
<p>
With this interface, code that has replaced a protected data structure
will arrange for the disposal of the old version with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void call_rcu_tasks(struct head *rhp, void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rhp));
</pre>
<p>
Once the appropriate "grace period" has passed, <tt>func()</tt> will be
called with the given <tt>rhp</tt> to free the structure.  For users of
RCU-tasks, that is pretty much the entire API.  Unlike ordinary
RCU, RCU-tasks has no equivalent to <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> for access to
protected data structures.

<p>
Ordinary RCU has, over the years, acquired a great deal of complexity in
order to maximize the scalability of the subsystem.  RCU-tasks, instead, is
refreshingly simple, at least in its initial implementation.  There is a
single linked list of <tt>rcu_head</tt> structures that have been passed to
<tt>call_rcu_tasks()</tt> but that have not yet been acted upon.

The patch set adds a new kernel thread charged with managing that list.
Once every second, it wakes up to see if any new entries have been added to
the list (a subsequent patch replaces the poll with a wait queue).  If so,
the entire list is moved to a separate list, and the wait for a new grace
period to pass begins.  
<p>
That wait starts by creating a separate list of
every runnable process in the system; tasks that are not runnable cannot,
by the rules, hold a reference to data structures protected by RCU-tasks,
and, thus, need not be considered.

For each runnable task, a special "<tt>rcu_tasks_holdout</tt>" flag is set
in the task structure.  Hooks have been placed in the scheduler to clear
that flag whenever the task voluntarily gives up the CPU or returns to user
space.  The RCU-tasks kernel thread goes into a separate loop, waking up
every tenth of a second, to 
work through the list of "holdout" tasks; any that have had their flag
reset are removed from the list.  Once the list is empty, the destructor
callbacks can be called and the cycle can start anew.
<p>
The code gets somewhat more complex as the patch series goes on.  The
addition of testing infrastructure and stall detection adds somewhat to its
footprint.  The biggest addition, though, is the addition of handling of
tasks that exit while they are on the holdout list.  Clearly, checking for
the "holdout" flag in a task structure that may no longer exist is a bad
idea, so this case does need to be properly handled.  Doing so involves
adding a new type of lock-protected doubly linked list and a bunch of
management code; it is the biggest part of the entire patch set.
<p>
Thus far, we have not yet seen patches to make other code actually use this
new facility.  Most of the comments on this patch set have come from Peter
Zijlstra, who is <a href="/Articles/607138/">concerned</a> about the
overhead of polling and the lack of accounting of that overhead.  So there
are a few questions yet to be answered. While RCU-tasks may well prove
to be a useful addition to the RCU API, nobody is expecting to see it in
the 3.17 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

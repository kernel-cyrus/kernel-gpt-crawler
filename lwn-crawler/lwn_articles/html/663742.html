           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 11, 2015</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, over 10,800 non-merge changesets have been pulled into
the mainline kernel repository during the 4.4 merge window.  This would
thus appear to be another busy development cycle.  We are still somewhat
short of the 12,274 changes pulled during the 4.2 merge window, but there
is still time to get there.  It's worth noting that over 2,400 of the
changes pulled this time came via the staging tree — a lot even for the
staging tree's standards.
<p>
Some of the interesting, user-visible changes pulled for 4.4 include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/650538/"><tt>mlock2()</tt></a> system call has
     been added.  This version of <tt>mlock()</tt> supports a
     <tt>flags</tt> argument, which has been used to add the new
     <tt>VM_LOCKONFAULT</tt> feature.  When this flag is set, pages in the
     indicated range will be locked into memory once they are faulted in,
     but the range will not be populated when the <tt>mlock2()</tt> call is
     made. 
<p>
<li> The output of the <tt>stat</tt> file found in each process's
     <tt>/proc</tt> directory has changed.  In particular, the
     <tt>wchan</tt> field (number 30!) used to contain the absolute kernel
     address where a process is blocked — a leak of important kernel
     information.  It now returns zero for a running process, or one for a
     process that is blocked.
<p>
<li> Loopback-mounted filesystems can now support direct and asynchronous
     I/O operations.  A precursor to this work was <a
     href="/Articles/535034/">covered here</a> in 2013, but the code that
     was actually merged appears to be a much simpler implementation.
<p>
<li> The block layer <a href="/Articles/663879/">now supports I/O
     polling</a> on high-performance devices.  In some situations, polling
     can lead to significantly lower latencies and higher throughput.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/641247/">LightNVM</a> patch set has been
     merged; this work adds support for solid-state storage devices that
     allow low-level access.  With such devices, the kernel can do the
     low-level management work that is normally done by the flash
     translation layer, opening up the possibility of higher-performance
     and more reliable operation.
<p>
<li> Journaled RAID5 support has been added to the MD subsystem; the
     addition of a journal to RAID5 can guarantee that inopportune power
     failures will not corrupt a RAID volume, even when it is running in
     the degraded mode.  Eventually it should offer performance
     improvements as well, but that's for a future merge window.
<p>
<li> The <tt>perf</tt> tool is now able to build and load eBPF programs for
     use with performance monitoring and event tracing.  There have been
     many other changes to <tt>perf</tt>, as usual; see <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/b02ac6b18cd4e2c76bf0a102c20c429b973f5f76">the
     merge commit</a> for details.
<p>
<li> BPF maps which, until now, were tied to the lifetime of their
     associated file descriptor, can now be made persistent.  They are
     stored into a virtual filesystem at <tt>/sys/fs/bpf</tt>.  See <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/42984d7c1e563bf92e6ca7a0fd89f8e933f2162e">this
     commit</a> for examples of how this feature can be used.
<p>
<li> As <a href="/Articles/660331/">described here</a> in October,
     unprivileged users are now able to load eBPF programs to use as socket
     filters. 
<p>
<li> A new TCP packet-loss detection mechanism called RACK has been
     merged.  In short: when a selective ACK for a packet is received, any
     non-acknowledged packets sent at least one round-trip time before the
     acked packet will be considered lost and retransmitted.  This
     heuristic differs from current mechanisms in that it uses transmit
     times rather than packet sequence to decide what might be lost.
     Google has evidently been running this code for the last year with
     good results and plans to propose the algorithm as an IETF standard.
     Some information can be found in the changelogs for <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/659a8ad56f490279f0efee43a62ffa1ac914a4e0">this
     commit</a> and <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/4f41b1c58a32537542f14c1150099131613a5e8a">this
     commit</a>. 
<p>
<li> The arm64 architecture can now run with a 16KB page size.  Note that
     Linus has <a href="/Articles/663941/">expressed</a> some strong doubts
     about whether this feature is useful in the real world.
<p>
<li> Virtualization with KVM can now take advantage of hardware interrupt
     bypass capabilities.  This feature allows interrupts for a device
     assigned to a guest to be delivered directly to that guest without
     having to pass through the host first.
<p>
<li> The NFS client now supports the NFSv4.2 CLONE operation (which makes a
     fast copy of a file) using an <tt>ioctl()</tt> that looks suspiciously
     like the Btrfs clone command.
<p>

     </ul>

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The new "userio" module allows an application to connect to the kernel
     and emulate serial I/O devices (laptop touchpads, for example).  See
     <tt><a
     href="/Articles/663755/">Documentation/input/userio.txt</a></tt> for
     details. 
<p>
<li> The arm64 architecture has gained support for the <a
     href="/Articles/612153/">KASan</a> debugging tool.
<p>
<li> The block layer now supports "persistent reservations," whereby a
     portion of a shared storage device can be reserved to a specific
     system.  See <tt><a
     href="/Articles/663792/">Documentation/block/pr.txt</a></tt> for
     details. 
<p>
<li> The memory-management improvements <a
     href="/Articles/658081/">described here</a> in September have been
     merged.  They simplify memory management in a number of ways, change
     the way pages are reserved for high-priority allocators, and rework
     the handling of memory-allocation flags.
<p>
<li> Trace instances have a new sysfs file (<tt>set_event_pid</tt>) that
     can be used to restrict trace events to those associated with a
     specific process.  Most trace options are now configurable on a
     per-instance basis as well.
<p>
<li> The graphics documentation has been renamed from
     <tt>drm.tmpl</tt> to <tt>gpu.tmpl</tt> to reflect the fact that, at
     this point, it covers a lot more than just direct rendering.
<p>
<li> There is a new x86-specific configuration option
     (<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_WX</tt>) that puts out warnings for memory sections
     that are mapped as being both writable and executable.  Unfortunately,
     it triggers frequently, and its output is relatively hard to use, so
     the option is being disabled by default for now.
<p>
<li> The <tt>make xconfig</tt> graphical configuration utility has been
     forward-ported to Qt5; builds with Qt3 are no longer supported.
<p>
<li> The media subsystem now has support for software-defined radio
     transmitters (receiver support has been present for some time).
</ul>
<p>

If the usual schedule holds, the 4.4 merge window can be expected to close
on November&nbsp;15, though Linus has been known to bring things to a close
early at times.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Note: the stat change does not break procps, because procps uses /proc/$pid/wchan instead. It only breaks attackers trying to get ASLR info, and kernel hackers trying to see where their test program is blocked (who can just revert this commit, or use perf).<br>
<p>
Another potential-but-not-actual ABI change under /proc: the Vmalloc* fields are gone from /proc/meminfo (well, set to zero), because they consume noticeable time to compute and are redundant to /proc/vmallocinfo. The latter can only be read by root, but if a non-root program cares about stuff like this, something very strange is going on...<br>

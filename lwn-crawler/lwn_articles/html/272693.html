<h1>A better DMA memory allocator</h1>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 10, 2008</br>
           </div>
As any device driver author knows, hardware can be a pain sometimes.  In
the early days of Linux, peripherals attached to the ISA bus inflicted
their particular variety of pain by being unable to use more than
24&nbsp;bits to access memory.  What that meant, in practical terms, was
that ISA devices could not perform DMA operations on memory above 16MB.
The PCI bus lifted that restriction, but, for some time, there were quite a
few "PCI" devices that were minimally modified ISA peripherals; many of
those retained the 16MB limit.
<p>
To handle the needs of these devices, Linux has long maintained the DMA
memory zone.  Drivers which need to allocate memory from that zone would
specify GFP_DMA in their allocation requests.  The memory management code
takes special care to keep memory in that zone available so that DMA
requests can be satisfied.  In this way, the system can provide reasonable
assurance that memory will be available to perform DMA in ways which meet
the special needs of this particularly challenged hardware.
<p>
The only problem is that there aren't a whole lot of devices out there
which still have the old 24-bit addressing limitation.  So the DMA zone
tends to sit idle.  Meanwhile, there <i>are</i> devices with other sorts of
limitations.  Many peripherals only handle 32-bit addresses, so their DMA
buffers must be allocated in the bottom 4GB of memory.  There is a subset,
however, with stranger limitations - 30 or 31-bit addresses, for example.
The kernel's DMA library provides a way for drivers to disclose that sort
of embarrassing limitation, but the memory management code does not really
help the DMA layer make allocations which satisfy those constraints.  So
drivers for such devices must use the DMA zone (which may not be present on
all architectures), or hope that normal zone memory fits the bill.
<p>
Andi Kleen has set out to clean up this situation with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/272586/">a new DMA memory allocator</a>.  His
solution is to take a chunk of memory out of the kernel's buddy allocator
entirely and manage it in an entirely different way, forming a reserve pool
for DMA allocations.  The result is a bit
of a departure from normal Linux memory management algorithms, but it may
well be better suited to the task at hand.

<p>

The new "mask" allocator grabs a configurable chunk of low memory at boot
time.  Allocations from this region are made with a separate set of calls,
with the core API being:
<p>
<pre>
    struct page *alloc_pages_mask(gfp_t gfp, unsigned size, u64 mask);
    void __free_pages_mask(struct page *page, unsigned size);

    void *get_pages_mask(gfp_t gfp, unsigned size, u64 mask);
    void free_pages_mask(void *mem, unsigned size);
</pre>
<p>

<tt>alloc_pages_mask()</tt> looks a lot like the longstanding
<tt>alloc_pages()</tt> function, but there's some important differences.
The <tt>size</tt> parameter is the desired size of the allocation, rather
than the "order" value used by <tt>alloc_pages()</tt>, and <tt>mask</tt>
describes the range of usable addresses for this allocation.  Though
<tt>mask</tt> looks like a bitmask, it is really better understood as the
address value that the allocated memory should have; "holes" in the mask
would make no sense.
<p>
A call to <tt>alloc_pages_mask()</tt> will first attempt to allocate the
requested memory using the normal Linux memory allocator, on the assumption
that the reserved DMA memory is an especially limited resource.  If the
allocation fails, perhaps because there's no physically-contiguous chunk of
sufficient size available, then the allocator will dip into the reserved
DMA pool.  If the normal allocation succeeds, though, the allocated memory
must still be tested against the maximum allowable address: the normal
memory allocator, remember, has no support for allocating below an arbitrary
address.  So if the returned memory is out of bounds, it must be
immediately freed and the reserved pool will be used instead.
<p>
That reserved pool is not managed like the rest of memory.  Rather than the
buddy lists maintained by the slab allocator, the DMA allocator has a
simple bitmap describing which pages are available.  It will normally cycle
through the entire memory region, allocating the next available chunk of
sufficient size.  If that chunk is above the memory limit, though, the
allocator will move back to the lower end of the reserved pool and allocate
from there instead.  Since DMA allocations tend to be short-lived, one
would expect that a suitable block of memory would either be available or
become available in the near future.
<p>
One other difference of note is that, unlike the slab allocator, the DMA
allocator does not round memory allocation sizes up to the next power of
two.  DMA allocations can be relatively large, so that rounding can result
in significant internal fragmentation and memory waste.
<p>
At the next level up, Andi has added a new form of mempool which uses the
DMA allocator:
<p>
<pre>
    mempool_t *mempool_create_pool_pmask(int min_nr, int size, u64 mask);
</pre>
<p>
This pool will behave like normal mempools, with the exception that all
allocations will be below the limit passed in as <tt>mask</tt>.  These pools are used
in the block layer, where memory allocations for DMA must succeed.
<p>

One might object that reserving a big chunk of low memory for this purpose
reduces the total amount of memory available to the system - especially if
the DMA allocator is cherry-picking normal memory whenever it can anyway.
But the cost is not as bad as one might think.  These patches do away with
the old DMA zone, which, for all practical purposes, was already managed as
a reserved (and often unused) memory area.  Some 64-bit architectures also
set aside a significant chunk (around 64MB) of low memory for the swiotlb -
essentially a set of bounce buffers used for impedance matching between
high memory (&gt;4GB) buffers and devices which cannot handle more than
32-bit addresses.  With Andi's patch set, the swiotlb, too, makes
allocations from the DMA area and no longer has its own dedicated memory
pool.  So the total amount of memory set aside for I/O will not change very
much; it could, in fact, get smaller.
<p>

For most driver authors, there will be little in the way of required
changes if this patch set gets merged.  The DMA layer already allows
drivers to specify an address mask with <tt>dma_set_mask()</tt>; with the
DMA allocator in place, that mask will be better observed.  The one change
which might affect a few drivers is further down the line: eventually the
<tt>GFP_DMA</tt> memory allocation flag will go away.  Any driver which
still uses this flag should set a proper mask instead.
<p>
So far, there has been little discussion resulting from the posting of
these patches.  Silence does not mean assent, of course, but it would
appear that there is little opposition to this set of changes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I seem to recall that there are actually devices out there whose mask of addresses they can
use for DMA actually does have holes in it, due to some of their address lines being miswired
or something like that. It's hard to come up with a hardware quirk that's so nonsensical that
there isn't hardware that manages to have it.

      <p>The classic example of that is that SA-1100 (old ARMv4, no longer manufactured) DMA controller had an erratum which meant that one address bit could never be used ... every other MByte was unusable for DMA.  So this is a case where the functionality of a DMA address "mask" was appropriate, instead of just a "biggest address" value.  Intel never fixed that bug (or a boatload of others in that chip).

<p>It escapes me why Linux calls what it has a "mask"; it's long overdue to change its name to reflect the fact that it's just a ceiling on the addresses usable for DMA.  Calling it a "mask" makes it seem like the complete inability to handle that SA-1100 erratum is a bug.

<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2014-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
The Android microconference at the 2014 Linux Plumbers Conference started
off with an assessment of how the Android project was doing with regard to
integration of its kernel changes with the mainline.  The general feeling
was that things are 
getting better; with 3.14, Android carries "only" 346 patches on top of the
mainline kernel.  But subsequent events have shown that the long-lasting
tension between Android and mainline kernel developers has not entirely
dissipated yet; the much-maligned Android "binder" mechanism is now one of
the central points of that tension.
<p>
Many of the Android-specific components that <i>are</i> in the mainline
kernel still live in the staging tree.  Early in the session, Greg
Kroah-Hartman got up to discuss whether any of those components should be
moved out of staging â€” either out of the kernel tree entirely, or into the
mainline proper.  As an example of the first type, the Android "logger"
module, which is no longer used as of the Lollipop release, may simply go
away entirely.  The story with binder is different, though.
<p>
Android's binder has a long history, having first shown up as part of the
BeOS system.  It is a mechanism for remote procedure calls and remote
object management that is used heavily within the Android system.  For an
overview of how binder relates to other interprocess communication
mechanisms, see <a href="/Articles/466304/">this 2011 article</a> by Neil
Brown.  Almost nobody seems to like binder; it is seen as abusing various
low-level kernel interfaces, has known security problems when used outside
of the tightly controlled Android setting, and more.  But Android needs it,
so it persists.
<p>
In the Plumbers session, Greg noted that binder had been in the staging
tree for years.  Since it is in active use, binder is not going away
anytime soon.  It is "horrible" and "broken by design," but it is an ABI

<a href="/Articles/618457/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2014/lce-lpc/GregKroahHartman-sm.jpg" alt="[Greg
Kroah-Hartman]" title="Greg Kroah-Hartman" width=250 height=271 border=0
align="right"></a> 

that we need to support, Greg said, so we might as well move it out of the
staging tree.  No objections to the idea were raised in the session;
everybody seemed happy with the idea of getting binder out of staging.
<p>
Greg wasted no time before <a href="/Articles/618424/">posting a patch</a>
to move binder out of staging; it was on the lists before the Android
microconference had concluded its business.  Whether Greg expected the
wider discussion to go as smoothly as the microconference is not clear;
what is clear is that's not what he got.
<p>
John Stultz, who has done a lot of work toward the mainlining of
Android-specific features, <a href="/Articles/618425/">expressed</a> a
few concerns.  The first of those had to do with maintenance: who was
going to be the maintainer of this code, and had the Android developers
agreed with that decision?  Greg's <a href="/Articles/618426/">response</a>
to this question was to note that the binder code had not changed in any
significant way for a long time; there is not, he feels, a lot of
maintenance that is needed.  To the extent that binder needs a maintainer,
Greg has volunteered to do it.
<p>
Another concern of John's had to do with efforts to replace binder with
something better tied into the kernel; work is progressing on writing a
binder-compatible library over the (still out-of-tree) <a
href="/Articles/580194/">kdbus</a> interface.  Moving binder into the
mainline, he thought, might reduce the incentive to get that work done.
Greg's answer here was that any such work is entirely new code; it doesn't
mitigate the need to maintain the existing code "forever."  "<q>So as
there really is nothing left to do on it, it deserves to be in the main
part of the kernel source tree.</q>"
<p>
Finally, John worried that moving binder to the mainline might encourage others
to make use of it; this was a concern that Alan Cox <a
href="/Articles/618428/">shared</a>.  Greg's response here is that there is
never a way to control how others will use the software we ship.  But, if
anybody outside of Android were to use binder, he said, "<q>you deserve
all of the pain and suffering and rooted machines you will get.</q>"
<p>
Arnd Bergmann raised <a href="/Articles/618429/">a number of issues</a>
mostly relating to security.  Evidently Android does not use the full API
exported by binder; he would like to see an audit of how the API is used so
that the unneeded parts can be removed, reducing the attack surface of the
whole thing.  Binder also leaks kernel-space pointers into user space and
has no awareness of namespaces, so it can also leak information between
containers in undesirable ways.  These points have not been addressed in
the discussion so far.
<p>
Finally, Christoph Hellwig <a href="/Articles/618449/">attempted to block
the move outright</a>, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	NAK.  It's complete rubbish and does things to the FD code that it
	really shouldn't.  Android needs to completely redo the interface,
	and there's been absolutely no work towards that.
</div>
<p>
Greg <a href="/Articles/618451/">disagreed</a> about the claim that no work
was being done toward a new interface; he also repeated that, no matter how
that work goes, the existing interface needs to be supported indefinitely.
Christoph was not satisfied by the answer, though; here he represents a
group of kernel developers who feel that the Android developers are still
not really trying to work with the mainline kernel.  From this point of
view, merging substandard Android code just allows Google to offload the
pain of maintaining it and encourages more of the same behavior in the
future.  About the only tool that the kernel developers have to address
this problem, as they see it, is their ability to refuse to accept
inadequate code.
<p>
At that point, the discussion wound down.
Greg has not said whether he still plans to move binder regardless of
the points that have been raised.  In the end, it could be said to make
little difference; binder will be shipped with the kernel tree whether it
is moved or not.  But the decision to move binder or not could send a
message on how the kernel development community feels about its
relationship with the Android team.

"Android's binder [...] first shown up as part of the BeOS system"<br>
<p>
I can't find any evidence that this is true in a meaningful sense. It's correct that people behind Binder (and thus OpenBinder) worked at Be Inc. but if Binder was part of that work it seems to have never shipped to end users.<br>
<p>
It is of course hard to prove a negative. Little pieces of binder might be present, undocumented and largely unused, in BeOS R5 without anybody knowing. But certainly if it's there its presence was so unfelt that BeOS clone project Haiku (once OpenBeOS) has nothing resembling binder nor any indication that it thinks such a thing is needed or desired.<br>
<p>
Some documents assert that Binder was the IPC mechanism in BeOS. In fact BeOS IPC is an asynchronous message passing system built around the BMessage type-length-value flattened data structure - it has little surface resemblance to Binder's synchronous local procedure calls.<br>
<p>
The next item in Binder's history is PalmOS. That's huge, a well-loved product on handheld devices. Except, it's referring to PalmOS Cobalt (6.0). That's the version developed by Palm spin-out Palm Source, and not only was it not successful as an independent venture - Cobalt was never even used on Palm's own hardware, maybe Binder made it awesome, maybe it was a disaster, end users will never be able to try it for themselves.<br>
<p>
It seems to me as though somebody successfully painted Binder as a project with a real world pedigree when in fact, for all the enthusiasm of its developers, Android was actually the first time it was used in anger in a consumer product. That certainly makes it easier to understand how it shipped while still "horrible" and "broken by design".<br>

In don't understand why what is done with logger (stop using it in android, and then remove it from vanilla entirely) can't be done with binder ? If kdbus can eventually replace binder, then leave binder in staging for now as Google's problem, and then remove it. Promoting binder from stagging to mainline today would probably make it harder to get rid of tomorrow, even if android stops using it ?<br>

I guess from the Android side that would be mostly a matter of timing. The 5.0 release presumably changed a lot of things, and removing the logger was one of them. Replacing binder with something else won't realistically happen before Android 6.0, whenever that may be.<br>

Given that the staging tree comes with "warranty void if seal broken" marks, should ABI be maintained for staging code?<br>
<p>
In my view, moving something out of staging comes down to: this code works properly, has sane design, sane ABI and semantics and doesn't give readers spontaneous thirst for the strongest liquors around... Or perhaps in k-dev speak: we're now committed to the ABI.<br>
<p>
I'd say the simplest example would be the removal of logger - this is an ABI break. So, putting things together: if there are known issues with the thing, should the kernel really start committing to not breaking or fixing the code?<br>

The binder devs are fairly unresponsive.  It's not hard to create documentation.  You could write half arsed documentation in one afternoon.<br>
<p>
I have seen other maintainers where you say "Your code is ugly.  Look at this function everything about it is horrible.  The rest of your code is the same."  They fix the one function and leave everything else the same.  If you keep sending half arsed patches to fix review comments then we eventually just merge your code even when we aren't 100% happy.<br>
<p>
The binder devs could have fixed up the binder ioctl to use proper return codes.  That would take 10 minutes of work and it fixes a specific problem that I complained about.<br>
<p>
Instead of that they are all "No, you need to merge it as-is because we aren't going to lift a finger to fix anything."  What about when it has real bugs?<br>

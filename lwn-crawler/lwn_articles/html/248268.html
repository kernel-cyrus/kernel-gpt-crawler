           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 6, 2007</br>

The 2007 version of the Linux Kernel Developers' Summit was held on
September&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;6 in Cambridge, UK.  Approximately 80 developers
at this invitation-only event held discussions on a wide variety of topics
covering all aspects of kernel development.  As usual, LWN editor Jonathan
Corbet was there.  Reports from the sessions will appear below as they are
written.
<p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="/Articles/248195/">The distributor panel</a>.  Kernel
     maintainers from four distributors attended a session meant to be a
     forum where they could tell the community how the process could be
     improved from their point of view.  In the event, much of the
     information flowed in the other direction, with community developers
     expressing frustration with a number of distributor practices.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/248343/">Mini-summit reports</a>.  Reports from 
     mini-summits covering power management, filesystems and storage,
     virtual memory, and virtualization held in the months prior to the
     main kernel summit.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/248376/">The greater kernel ecosystem and
     user-space APIs</a>.  A discussion of how the kernel presents
     interfaces to user space and the low-level software which helps with
     this task.  Also covered here is the session on a proposal for a
     formal review process for new system calls.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/248388/">Kernel quality</a>.  In the session he led
     on this topic, Andrew Morton was unable to say whether he thought our kernel
     releases were getting better or worse.  But he had no doubt that we
     could be doing a better job than we are now.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/248400/">Hardware support and the i386/x86_64
     merger</a>.  This was a discussion of the state of drivers for various
     difficult chipsets; it included AMD's important announcement of the
     opening of its graphics processors.  There was also a session on the
     question of whether the i386 and x86_64 architecture trees should be
     merged.      
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>

The preparation of reports from the second day is being somewhat delayed by
your editor's travel.  They will show up here as they become available.
<p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="/Articles/248878/">The customer panel</a>.  An interesting 
     discussion of customer needs by representatives from Dreamworks,
     Credit Suisse, and the Linux Foundation.
<p>
<li> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/248929/">Realtime and syslets</a>.  
     What is the status of the realtime patch set, and what's next for
     syslets? 
<p>
<li> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/248931/">Scalability</a>.  Issues for
     people trying to run Linux on very large and very small systems.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/249054/">Memory management</a>.  Discussions on
     large page support, test cases for memory management patches, and
     letting applications help with memory pressure.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/249080/">Containers</a>.  What remains to be done
     to have a complete containers implementation in the mainline kernel.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/249104/">Developer relations and development
     process</a>.  How can the community bring in more developers and avoid
     driving away those who are here now?  This question was addressed,
     along with a number of nuts-and-bolts issues relating to how the
     development process works.
<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/249123/">Closing session</a>.  The final session of
     the 2007 kernel summit was about the kernel summit itself.  Was this
     event what the attendees had hoped for, and how should things be done
     in the future? 

</ul>
<p>
<h3>The group picture</h3>
<p>
How could there be a kernel summit without a group picture?  Here is (most
of) the group in front of the Downing College dormitory where many of us
stayed:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/lce2007/SummitGroup500.jpg" width=485 height=125
alt="[Summit group photo]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
This photo is available in the following forms:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="/Articles/248889/">Medium resolution</a> (1200x500)
<li> <a href="/Articles/248890/">Full resolution</a> (2573x1100)
</ul>
<p>
By popular demand, we also have <a href="/Articles/248891/">an annotated
version of the full-resolution image</a> with names assigned to as many
faces as possible.
<p>
Thanks to Michael Kerrisk for operating your editor's camera, allowing him
to be in the group picture for the first time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

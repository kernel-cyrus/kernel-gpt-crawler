<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 11, 2015</br>
           </div>
It has been said that the kernel's block I/O layer routinely steals ideas
from the networking stack.  In truth, good ideas move in both directions,
but there can be no doubt that block I/O has become more like network I/O
over the years.  The details differ but, at the highest level, it's a
matter of independent computers sending messages to each other over
increasingly fast transports.  So it is perhaps not surprising to see one
of the network stack's oldest performance-improving techniques — I/O
polling — show up in the block layer.
<p>
In the networking world, I/O polling is called "NAPI" (for "new API"); LWN
first <a href="/Articles/30107/">reported on it</a> in early 2003.  NAPI
allows the networking core to poll drivers for new packets, rather than
having those drivers inject packets in response to interrupts from the
interface hardware.  Moving from an interrupt-driven mode to polling for
performance reasons may seem counter-intuitive but, in a high-traffic
situation, it makes sense.  Servicing interrupts is expensive; it's also
pointless if you know that there will be new packets available whenever you
get around to looking for them.  If the CPU has nothing else to do while
waiting for packets, polling is also a good way to minimize latency.  It
will always be faster to watch for an arriving packet than to wait for the
entire interrupt-handling machinery (in both hardware and software) to do
its thing.
<p>
I/O polling made no sense for the block layer as long as storage was
dominated by rotating media.  A computer can get a lot of work done
by the time the disk head and platter move to the right position for the data of
interest, and even the fastest drive can only generate hundreds of
completion interrupts each second.  Solid-state drives are different,
though; I/O completion times are tiny and even a low-end drive can complete
huge numbers of operations per second.  With such a drive, the case for
doing some other work while waiting for an I/O completion interrupt is
rather weaker.
<p>
How much weaker can be seen in the cover letter for the <a
href="/Articles/663543/">polled block I/O patch set</a> from Jens Axboe and
Christoph Hellwig.  Using a sophisticated "read the device with
<tt>dd</tt>" benchmark, Jens shows that, when polling is enabled, the
throughput of an NVM Express device can nearly double.  One might argue
that this 
benchmark is designed to maximize the perceived performance benefit, but it
also mirrors real-world usage patterns.  A program doing synchronous reads
from a block device, where it must wait for each read to complete before
proceeding, is not an uncommon sight.
<p>
(If one wants to quibble further with the results, more fertile ground may
be found in this comment from Jens: "<q>Contrary to intuition, sometimes
the slower devices benefit more, since the slower completion yields a
deeper C-state on the processor.</q>"  The suggestion here is that
polling is gaining some of its benefit by preventing the CPU from going
into a sleep state; it would be interesting to see the results when power
management is disabled.)
<p>
The current patch set can only enable polling for devices driven via the
multiqueue API.  If a device is fast enough for polling to make sense, use
of multiqueue I/O is probably indicated as well.  Polling is controlled by
the new <tt>queue/io_poll</tt> sysfs flag attached to each block device;
the default is to not use polling.
<p>

The first step in the patch series affects a fairly wide range of drivers,
as it 
changes the prototype of the <tt>make_request_fn()</tt> to return a "cookie"
identifying each submitted I/O operation:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef unsigned int blk_qc_t;
    typedef blk_qc_t (make_request_fn) (struct request_queue *q,
    		      struct bio *bio);
</pre>
<p>
The cookie returned by <tt>make_request_fn()</tt> can be anything, but the
expected pattern is for drivers to use:
<p>
<pre>
    blk_qc_t blk_tag_to_qc_t(unsigned int tag, unsigned int queue_num);
</pre>
<p>
to construct the cookie from the queue number and the tag identifying the
request.  The special <tt>BLK_QC_T_NONE</tt> value can be used to indicate
that no cookie exists.  This change ripples through the block-driver
subsystem, as each driver must be changed to reflect the new
prototype regardless of whether it supports polling.  Once that structure
is in place, the special multiqueue <tt>make_request_fn()</tt> is changed
to return the expected cookie.
<p>
The core of the patch is the addition of a function to poll on the
completion of a specific I/O request:
<p>
<pre>
    bool blk_poll(struct request_queue *q, blk_qc_t cookie);
</pre>
<p>
This function, in turn, calls a new driver-specific function added to the
<tt>blk_mq_ops</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef int (poll_fn)(struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *ctx, unsigned int tag);
</pre>
<p>
This function should poll the status of the operation identified by
<tt>tag</tt>, returning a nonzero value if that operation has completed.
<tt>blk_poll()</tt> will call the driver-level <tt>poll_fn()</tt>
repeatedly as long as the operation remains outstanding, no higher-priority
process wants to run, and no signals are pending.
A call to <tt>blk_poll()</tt> is added to the direct I/O implementation, so
that synchronous, direct I/O will poll for completion whenever it is
possible.  Finally, the NVMe low-level driver gains a <tt>poll_fn()</tt> to
actually implement the polling.
<p>
The results are as described above: a large increase in I/O throughput.
That is the case even though the NVMe implementation could stand some
improvement: it currently leaves interrupts enabled, so I/O completion will
interrupt the processor even when polling is in use.  In any case, complete
elimination of interrupts, as happens with NAPI, may be more difficult in
the block context.  A NAPI driver puts itself explicitly into the polling
mode, and the actual polling is scheduled by the networking core.  A block
driver, instead, only knows that polling is in use when its
<tt>poll_fn()</tt> is called, and that can be done by any process that is
waiting for I/O.  Since a block driver can never know that another
<tt>poll_fn()</tt> call is coming, it must always be prepared to handle
completion via interrupts.
<p>

That said, this API is in an early state and may evolve considerably before
it is considered production-ready.  The main purpose for posting it now is
to enable other developers to play with it — an objective that should be
easy to achieve since this patch set was merged for the 4.4 release.  As
that playing takes place, the resulting experience should lead to
improvements in the interface.  And the process of streamlining the block
layer to allow it to keep up with ever-faster storage devices will
continue.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are basically two types of polling on the block side. One takes care of interrupt mitigation, so that we can reduce the IRQ load in high IOPS scenarios. That is governed by block/blk-iopoll.c, and is very much like NAPI on the networking side, we've had that since 2009 roughly. It still relies on an initial IRQ trigger, and from there we poll for more completions, and finally re-enable interrupts once we think it's sane to do so. This is driver managed, and opt-in.<br>
<p>
The new block poll support is a bit different. We don't rely on an initial IRQ to trigger, since we never put the application to sleep. We can poll for a specific piece of IO, not just for "any IO". It's all about reducing latencies, as opposed to just reducing the overhead of an IRQ storm.<br>
<p>
As the article states, this is early days, and is meant to form the basis of some interesting experiments. When the next generation NVM storage ships and reduces latencies by an order of magnitude, we'll have something that is more production grade.<br>

<p>
That has been going on for a while now. The first time davem and I talked about the overlap in problem sets for block and networking was probably 15 years ago. But it is one of those problems that initially seems like it has more overlap than it really does, so it's not quite straightforward. Ideas have migrated in both directions, however. And it's not like we're oblivious to stealing/adopting whatever good ideas come out from either camp.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 16, 2020</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, 7,153 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the
mainline Git repository for the 5.10 release — over a period of four days.
This development cycle is clearly off to a strong start.  Read on for an
overview of the significant changes merged thus far for the 5.10 kernel
release.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The arm64 architecture can now do performance-events monitoring
     over Arm's CMN-600 interconnect.
<li> The Arm v8.5 <a
     href="https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/PDF/Arm_Memory_Tagging_Extension_Whitepaper.pdf1">memory
     tagging extension [PDF]</a> is now supported.  This feature allows a
     four-bit tag to be assigned to every 16-byte "granule" in physical
     memory; whenever a pointer into a specific granule is dereferenced,
     the CPU will ensure that the tag stored in the pointer matches that
     assigned to the granule.  Proper use of this extension can trap
     use-after-free and buffer-overflow bugs (and attempts to exploit those
     bugs).  See <a href="/Articles/834289/">this article</a> for more
     information on this feature.
<li> The ia64 performance-monitoring code has been removed.  Few are likely
     to miss it, since it hasn't worked for years.
<li> AMD's "secure encrypted virtualization" (SEV) feature encrypts memory
     assigned to virtualized guests; Linux has supported SEV for a while.
     The new SEV-ES feature, merged for 5.10, expands SEV by encrypting the
     guest's processor 
     registers as well, making them unavailable to the host unless the
     guest explicitly shares them.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The io_uring subsystem now supports <a href="/Articles/826053/">the
     creation of restricted rings</a> that can be passed safely to a
     less-trusted process.
<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html"><tt>pidfd_open()</tt>
     system call</a> now supports a <tt>PIDFD_NONBLOCK</tt> flag to create
     a non-blocking file descriptor.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4da9af0014b5">this commit</a> for a
     thorough description of the semantics of non-blocking pidfds.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The Btrfs filesystem has gained some significant performance
     improvements in <tt>fsync()</tt> operations.
<li> XFS has seen a bunch of work to resolve its year-2038 problems;
     timestamps in this filesystem are now good through 2468.  Developers
     now have clear warning of a problem coming in 448 years, but chances
     are they will procrastinate on addressing it for at least 440 of
     them. 
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Graphics</b>:

     STMicroelectronics STUSB160x Type-C controllers,
     Maxim TCPCI based Type-C chips, and
     Qualcomm PMIC USB Type-C detectors.
<li> There is an entirely new user-space API for GPIO lines.  Naturally,
     this API is rigorously undocumented, but some information can be
     gleaned from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b53911aa872d">this
     commit</a>.
<li> The "raw" char device, which provides a classic Unix-style char
     interface to block devices, has been deprecated with the intention of
     removing it in the 5.14 release.  The raw device was primarily used
     for direct I/O, which has been supported via the <tt>O_DIRECT</tt>
     flag since 2002.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for the RC4-HMAC-MD5 KerberosV algorithm has been removed from
     the crypto subsystem.  This algorithm was created for compatibility
     with Windows 2000; according to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e33d2a7b3041">the commit</a>, its
     removal "<q>should only adversely affect interoperability with
     Windows NT/2000 systems that have not received any updates since 2008
     (but are connected to a network nonetheless)</q>".
<li> The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shen-sm2-ecdsa-02">SM2
     digital-signature algorithm</a> is now supported.
<li> It is now possible to remove <tt>security.selinux</tt> extended
     attributes from files, but only before the SELinux policy is loaded.
     This makes it possible to "unlabel" files when SELinux is not being
     used. 
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for <a
     href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/">Amazon Nitro
     enclaves</a> has been added.  See <a
     href="/Articles/834427/">Documentation/virt/ne_overview.rst</a> for
     some more information.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/831540/">seqcount latch</a> specialized
     lock type has been added.
<li> "Orphan sections" — code or data sections that find their way into the
     kernel image without having been explicitly put there by the linker
     script — will now generate warnings during the kernel build.  This
     change was made to protect the kernel from the possibility of unwanted
     changes in how linkers place those sections; the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/34eb62d868d7">merge changelog</a>
     describes orphan sections as "<q>a long-standing source of obscure
     bugs</q>".
<li> Static calls are a mechanism for performing indirect function calls
     with better performance, especially on systems where <a
     href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">retpolines</a>
     would 
     otherwise have to be used to protect against Spectre vulnerabilities.
     This mechanism has <a href="/Articles/774743/#static">been under
     development since 2018</a>; it was finally merged for 5.10.
<li> The <tt>printk()</tt> subsystem has gained a new lockless ring buffer
     meant to be a first step in resolving a number of problems in this
     area.  See <a href="/Articles/800946/">this article</a> for an overall
     description of the <tt>printk()</tt> work, including the new ring
     buffer. 
<li> The minimum version of Clang needed to build the kernel is now 10.0.1.
</ul>
<p>

The 5.10 merge window can be expected to close on October&nbsp;25, after
which the stabilization portion of the development cycle will begin.  Stay
tuned for LWN's coverage of the second half of the 5.10 merge window, to be
published shortly after the window closes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I&#x27;ve heard from Amazon engineers at the last re:Invent that they reasonably believe that nested virtualization is unsafe on the current Intel CPUs. Their _current_ (with emphasis on &quot;current&quot;) Graviton2 ARM family also doesn&#x27;t support it.<br>

Ohh, that&#x27;s interesting.<br>
<p>
Do you know whether they meant the current KVM nVMX implementation (which is tricky to get right with issues getting fixed all the time) or the VMX support itself in the CPU (as the expression &quot;current CPUs&quot; in your comment would suggest)?<br>

Google and Oracle have been offering nVMX for years and have contributed lots of changes. nVMX is definitely ready for production use and nSVM is getting there (though there is one processor erratum that complicates things).<br>
<p>
What follows is my guess on what things really look like. First, Amazon plays complicated games with /dev/mem and memremap for EC2 in order to save the price of &quot;struct page&quot; for guest memory (that&#x27;s 1.5% so nothing to sneeze at), and that makes nested virtualization slower. Second, their kernel is probably based on older versions of Linux and thus it lacks a lot of the improvements made to nested virtualization lately. And finally, Amazon sells bare metal instances at a higher price  so they have no interest in covering virtualization workloads.<br>

VMX seems so complicated to me that I expect there to be lots of hardware bugs in it accessible from the hypervisor. That&#x27;s not a big deal if you trust the hypervisor, which you mostly do at the root, but it&#x27;s deeply problematic for nested virtualization.<br>
<p>
*Maybe* so much bug hunting has been done by people with variously-coloured hats, and so many bugs fixed, that this risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. But if this has been done then I would expect some of those bugs to have been published, and I haven&#x27;t seen that, not like we have for other attack surfaces.<br>

It is not *that* complicated actually, once you get familiar with it. Also, large parts of the state is not passed through to the processor by the root hypervisor, so the configuration for the nested guest ends up being not very different from that for the non-nested case.<br>

VMLOAD/VMRUN/VMSAVE instructions check their operand against a range of restricted addresses (such as the SMM TSeg) and generate an instruction if the operand is within that address. When nesting is on, the address should be checked after it has gone through nested page tables, but instead it is checked as is.<br>
<p>
If the nested hypervisor is unlucky enough to place its VMCB at an address that the processor rejects, it will fail to enter the nested guest. There are various possible workarounds though (the simplest is to reduce the amount of memory below 4GB in the nested hypervisor to 1GB, because usually SMM TSeg is somewhere between 0x40000000 and 0xC0000000).<br>
<p>
Apparently it&#x27;s been there since the first SVM processors but we only noticed last year and it took a few months to find the root cause.<br>

Nitro enclaves are not a replacement for nested virtualization. The idea is that you offload part of the work, for example logging, to the enclave so that it is impossible to tamper with that data in case the parent VM is taken over. The parent is not necessarily trusses. With nested virtualization instead the parent has total control over the guest and must be trusted.<br>

Thanks for clarifying that, I guess it makes sense as an alternative to SGX that is simpler and actually works.<br>
<p>
But, is &quot;logging&quot; actually a valid use-case for Nitro enclaves?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Enclaves are virtual machines attached to EC2 instances that come with no persistent storage, no administrator or operator access, and only secure local connectivity to your EC2 instance.</font><br>
<p>
Not clear to me how a Nitro enclave can improve the security of logging if it can&#x27;t actually write logs anywhere without cooperation from the untrusted parent instance.<br>

You could encrypt logs within the enclave and send them back to the parent VM that immediately sends them somewhere for storage. This doesn&#x27;t guarantee that logs are actually forwarded and stored but it does guarantee confidentiality and integrity; in case of an attack this means that the attacker cannot wipe all of its traces. And at least it&#x27;s more interesting than DRM. :-)<br>
<p>
The enclave only gets a vsock connection to the outer would. One interesting feature would be the ability for the parent to configure (at enclave startup) a mapping from a vsock port to a remote TCP address/port, with the forwarding being done by the host so that the link cannot be broken.<br>

If you don&#x27;t care about the tamper-proof attestation that Nitro Enclaves provide, what&#x27;s the difference between a Nitro enclave and a locked-down KVM using nested virtualization with only a vsock, other than that nested virtualization seems likely to be slower?<br>

Money isn&#x27;t the issue. Bare-metal instances take an incredibly long time to start up (~10 minutes), compared to virtualized instances (~5-10 seconds, which is already far too long).<br>

Such an odd extension (not the &quot;virtual eternity&quot; of 64 bits). I guess they tried to shoe-horn the extended time into some existing on-disk bits for backward-compatibility, so I guess existing XFS installations work seamlessly with this. Right?<br>

ext4 had 32-bit seconds + 32-bit nanoseconds fields, and has reassigned 2 bits from nanoseconds to seconds. I would guess that XFS has made a similar change.<br>

      <p>No. That would be horrible waste of resources. APIs are changed so radically during review process that writing adequate documentation for them (with examples and diagrams) is usually pointless. It could be redone 2, 3, even 10 times in extreme cases.</p>

<p>But of course after new API is merged it's too late to write a documentation because, well, it's merged, why bother?</p>

<p>Not sure how could that issue be adequately resolved…</p>

Process.<br>
Do not require (but do encourage) documentation for a proposed API but demand it in order to merge the API.<br>
<p>
There is actually another benefit of this - forcing documentation is kind of an &quot;explain it to the duck&quot; session for developers that forces them to think about their new shiny interface from another angle.<br>

Yes, exactly. Good documentation eases the review process for maintainers.<br>
<p>
Writing good documentation is also a clarifying process for everyone to understand exactly what the feature does and how it can and cannot be used. It&#x27;s too easy to write some code and only later realize that the API is actually very difficult to use correctly; writing the documentation usually exposes this.<br>

That’s a BS argument, sorry.<br>
<p>
If the newly added user space API is really **that** contentious, then by the time the maintainer is going to merge the changes, he asks for a final iteration with proper documentation. Simply because if it’s not done at that moment, it might never be done in the future.<br>

      <p>This is where kerneldoc is great - documentation for the API sits with the implementation, and if you're working on the implementation, the API docs are right there, staring you in the face with the code you're reviewing.
<p>See <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpu/drm-uapi.rst">the DRM top-level</a>, which gets turned into <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/gpu/drm-uapi.html">this document based on both the  top-level and the code included by the top-level</a>.

<p>This sounds very reasonable.  No documentation, no merge.  The hard part is having the resolve to make it stick the first few times.  Once everyone knows that's the rule and it will be enforced, they'll know to have the documentation done before the merge.  Then the only hard part is keeping the documentation up to date as the code changes.

It&#x27;s worth noting that this is only probabilistic (for use-after-free the memory tag will eventually cycle back round and be usable again with an old pointer, and for buffer overflows you in general have a 1/16 chance of the out-of-bounds memory having a matching tag), with the exception that you can catch overflows into adjacent memory deterministically by choosing your tags such that adjacent allocations&#x27; are always different, and that using the tags for both simultaneously multiplies the constraints together such that both mitigations become weaker (higher probability of an invalid memory access not being detected) compared with exclusively enabling one.<br>

If the n tags used for this are assigned in a cycling pattern, than small overflows are detected reliable, and if n isn&#x27;t divisible by 2 all offsets by any x-order page are detected.<br>
<p>
While this doesn&#x27;t detect overflows to 100% it&#x27;s nevertheless a good defense.<br>

<p>
So, the important thing about use-after-free is that it&#x27;s actually not the real problem. If you free memory but continue to use it whilst it&#x27;s still free, so long as the entire page isn&#x27;t unmapped by the allocator (and so long as your allocator doesn&#x27;t go and pattern-fill the memory to try and catch these things), you don&#x27;t actually have a vulnerability. Where the vulnerabilities come from is use-after-*reallocation*, i.e. when you continue to use memory that has since been allocated to someone else. That allows you to then read and/or write to whatever their data structures are and do things like rewrite C++ vtables or conduct data-oriented attacks. Using a reserved tag for unallocated memory doesn&#x27;t solve that problem, as when malloc reuses freed memory it needs to assign it a different tag from whatever you&#x27;ve reserved, which it can&#x27;t do forever without eventually re-tagging that region of memory with the same as the original tag.<br>

Yeah, you can do things like that, but once you get significantly out-of-bounds there won&#x27;t be much of a useful pattern any more, both because the offset is likely fairly arbitrary and because you may be crossing into an allocation pool for a different bucket size, so for anything that&#x27;s a few pages out of bounds it&#x27;s highly likely to just degrade into a 1/n probability. It&#x27;s better than nothing, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, it just creates additional work for attackers to ensure they get an offset that lands on a correctly-tagged region.<br>

I bet attackers will very quickly learn how to groom the heap to ensure they get the right tag values for any fixed tag recycling scheme, at least when their wild-read/wild-write primitive allows an arbitrary offset. So I think allocators will have to use random tags.<br>

Now, there is. XFS has chosen to use a 64 bit nanosecond counter with the minimal value being in December 1901.<br>

The art of choosing new limits is finding one which will not be force a format change. I&#x27;m anticipating a larger format change in the next 50 years, and at that time XFS can go to larger timestamps.<br>

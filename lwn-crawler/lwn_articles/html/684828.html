<p>
At
the 2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit,
Dan Williams led a combined storage and filesystem session he jokingly
called "<tt>mmap()</tt> ponies" 
(referring to the <a 
href="/Articles/351422/"><tt>O_PONIES</tt> debate</a> from 2009).   The
discussion was about the <a href="/Articles/678011/">"I know what I'm
doing" flag</a> for <tt>mmap()</tt> that would allow user space to manage
its dirty cache lines when 
persistent memory and the DAX direct-access mechanism are being used.  The
overhead of the kernel tracking those 
dirty cache lines in the page cache can be avoided, but many saw it as a
premature optimization.
</p>

<p>
The flag in question is actually called <tt>MAP_PMEM_AWARE</tt>, but it
certainly acts like its longer name would imply.  Williams acknowledged
that it breaks POSIX semantics and noted that Dave Chinner was strongly
against it.  It is an attempt to "have our cake and eat it too", he said.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Jan Kara called it a "go faster" flag, but claimed that most of the
overhead would still be present.  The tracking would be needed to avoid
races between 
faults for regular pages and huge pages.  So the flag really won't even go
that much faster.
</p>

<p>
Williams said that one of Chinner's complaints was that there was no
reason to have a "go faster" flag when we don't know how slow it goes now.
But it is roughly ten times faster to simply flush the
cache lines from user space, as opposed to  calling <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msync.2.html"><tt>msync()</tt></a>
to flush a 4KB page when data in that range is dirtied.  The difference is
in the granularity that is being flushed, he said: 64 bytes for a cache
line versus 4KB for a page.
</p>

<p>
As several pointed out, though, pages can be larger than that, including
2MB huge pages or 1GB extra-huge pages.  Kara also said that the PPC
architecture has 64KB pages, so it is tracking on that granularity.  The
problem, he said, is that user space believes that flushing the cache lines
is enough to ensure data integrity, but it isn't.  There is metadata of
various sorts that filesystems need to persistently store, which requires
an <tt>fsync()</tt> or similar.
</p>

<p>
Williams acknowledged that managing the dirty data in user space without
calling <tt>fsync()</tt> will not allow filesystems to do copy-on-write
(CoW) or "other fancy stuff" behind the application's back.  But Chris
Mason pointed out that the filesystem doesn't know when the application is
done with the data; the filesystem defines when the read-only phase of its
data begins and ends, so without an <tt>fsync()</tt> it doesn't know when
to write its metadata.
</p>

<p>
Williams suggested that the DAX semantics could be changed so that all
faults are synchronous with respect to the metadata.  It would be "less
surprising" if that were simply a property of DAX, he said.  Kara said that
he still thinks it is a premature optimization, but that making faults
synchronous with metadata updates is probably the right way forward.
</p>

<p>
The flag may still be useful, Williams said, as it does mean that the
application knows that it is bypassing sync operations.  But he disagreed
with the "premature optimization" characterization.  Some data that he
received just before the session started showed the 10x performance
difference he had mentioned earlier.  The problem is that if a customer
asks "what happens if I don't call <tt>fsync()</tt>?", the answer from
filesystem developers will be that their data is not guaranteed to be
persistent.  That is what the flag would allow.
</p>

<p>
Kara suggested that the dirty data could still be tracked in the kernel,
but that information simply wouldn't be used.  Williams said that there is
"no real cost" to doing that tracking, so that would probably be fine.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o suggested a flag to <tt>msync()</tt> just for metadata flushes
as an approach.  Or perhaps an <tt>fmetadatasync()</tt> or similar system
call, that would simply sync all applicable filesystem metadata for a
rangeâ€”trusting user space to flush its data cache lines correctly.  Kara
said that it might make it difficult to determine what caused data-loss
problems, but Ts'o said that if data is lost, it is an application problem,
but if the filesystem is corrupted, that would indicate a filesystem bug.
</p>

<p>
Kara agreed and thought that <tt>fmetadatasync()</tt> would both be more
future-proof and more in line with what filesystem developers would
prefer.  It might not perform all that well for small updates, but should
be fine for large operations, he said.  Ts'o cautioned that it is still
early, so kernel developers really do not know how applications will want
to use persistent memory.  As time goes on, new or different interfaces may
be needed.

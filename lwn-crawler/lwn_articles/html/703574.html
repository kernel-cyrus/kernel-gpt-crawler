<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 18, 2016</br>
           <hr>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2016-Kernel_Recipes">Kernel
Recipes</a>
</div>
The mainline kernel has support for a wide range of hardware.  One place
where support has traditionally been lacking, though, is graphics
adapters.  As a result, a great many people are still using proprietary,
out-of-tree GPU drivers.  Daniel Vetter went before the crowd at <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/">Kernel Recipes 2016</a> to say
that the situation is not as bad as some think; indeed, he said, in this
area as well as others, world domination is proceeding according to plan.
<p>
<h4>The current state of affairs</h4>
<p>
The first stop on Vetter's tour of the direct rendering manager (DRM)
subsystem was documentation, and, in particular, the <a
href="/Articles/692704/">transition to Sphinx</a> that has unfolded over
the last couple of release cycles.  The new formatted documentation system
for the kernel is "pretty and awesome", and makes writing the documentation
fun.  As a result, there's now a lot more documentation than there used to
be; indeed, the <a
href="https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/index.html">DRM documentation</a>
is pretty much complete.  The biggest gap at this point is a top-level
picture that nicely ties all the pieces together.
<p>
Moving on to rather older work (he titled this section "dungeons and
dragons"), Vetter noted that there are still some DRM1 drivers around;
these are at least ten years old at this point.  They feature nasty
user-space APIs, root holes, and other delightful things.  These drivers
are built around a midlayer architecture, a design which has gone out of
fashion in recent years; the idea was to make it possible to build the
drivers on 
BSD systems.  In current kernels, these drivers are hidden behind the
<tt>CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY</tt> option.  They cannot be removed outright without
breaking things, though, so they will remain for a while.
<p>
The <a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/igt/">IGT tools from
Intel</a> have proved to be a useful test suite for the validation of DRM
drivers.  They are Intel-specific for now, but are being modified to be
more generic.  At this point, a number of drivers and
continuous-integration systems are using these tests to trap regressions.
See <a
href="https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-uapi.html#validating-changes-with-igt">the
DRM documentation</a> for information on how to validate drivers with the
IGT suite.
<p>
Recently there has been an influx of DRM developers from the ARM community;
that has led to a new set of problems.  The DRM subsystem is special,
Vetter said, in that it <a
href="https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-uapi.html#open-source-userspace-requirements">requires</a>
that the user-space API for any driver be 
open source.  Much of the code for these drivers runs in user space; the
10% that runs in the kernel is "useless" without the user-space side as
well.  A kernel driver without the user-space code cannot be enhanced or
maintained. 

<a href="/Articles/703612/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/recipes/DanielVetter2-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Daniel Vetter]" title="Daniel Vetter" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

The ARM folks were unaware of this restriction and not used to operating in
this mode, so the DRM maintainers have had to start rejecting their
patches.  The result was some screaming, but, at this point, the ARM
community understands the requirements and is starting to look at opening
up the user-space code as well.
<p>
One of the big changes in the DRM subsystem in recent years has been the
switch to the <a href="/Articles/653071/">atomic mode-setting API</a>.  The
original DRM API featured one <tt>ioctl()</tt> call for each operation to
be done; that resulted in a lot of display flickering as applications
worked through a long series of changes.  The atomic API allows everything
to be done with a single call, leading to flicker-free changes.  An atomic
change is an all-or-nothing affair; if it succeeds at all, it will succeed
completely.
<p>
This API also provides a separate call to check whether a set of changes
would succeed without actually making those changes.  It can be hard to
know before trying; hardware often has 
weird restrictions that get in the way.  He mentioned adapters with three
video outputs but only two clocks as an example.  Overlay support (the
ability to directly display a video stream from another source, such as a
camera, without going through user space) has been added to this API
as well.  Overlays went out of fashion for a while, but it turns out that a
lot of power can be saved by outputting the video directly; it is a crucial
feature for mobile systems.
<p>
At this point, there are 20 drivers in the mainline with atomic
mode-setting implementations; another two or three are added with each
release.  The adoption of this API far exceeds the rate of adoption of the
original kernel mode-setting API.  It helps that a lot of functionality is
in common code now, so the drivers themselves have gotten smaller.  The
support library has been made more modular; using it is not an
all-or-nothing affair like it used to be.
<p>
Use of the atomic API is growing; one example is the <a
href="https://dev.chromium.org/android/contributing-to-drm_hwcomposer">drm_hwcomposer</a>
library, written by Google for use with Android systems.  
The ChromeOS <a
href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/ozone">Ozone</a>
interface running on Wayland uses it, as do all the other Wayland
implementations.  We have, he said, "a driver API to rule them all" for the
first 
time.
<p>
<h4>Looking forward</h4>
<p>
Turning to future work, Vetter mentioned that there is interest in an
interface that can allocate buffers for use with multiple devices.  The <a
href="/Articles/480055/">ION memory allocator</a> offers this
functionality, but it remains Android-specific for now.
<p>
The old framebuffer device (fbdev) interface has been deprecated for some
time, but it still turns out to be useful in some settings.  In particular,
it can save memory bandwidth and power on some low-end displays — those that
require manual uploading of display data.  The generic
fbdev "defio" interface can now be remapped onto kernel mode-setting
operations, making it possible to write a full fbdev driver on top of the
DRM subsystem.
<p>
The <a
href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/drm-kms-helpers.html">simple
display pipeline helper</a> also makes writing simple drivers easy.  For
settings where there is a simple processing pipeline and a single
connector, it can provide access to the atomic API without most of the
complexity.  With this helper, the DRM API is "now strictly better" than
fbdev.
<p>
Fences are currently an area of active development.  A fence is like the
kernel's <tt>completion</tt> structure, in that it can be used to wait for
(and signal) the completion of an operation; it is intended to be used with
DMA operations in particular.  There are two models for fence usage.  In
the "implicit" model, the kernel attaches fences to I/O buffers and takes
care of everything; user space never sees it.  The "explicit" model,
instead, has the kernel providing fences to user space, which must then
manage them itself.
<p>
The implicit model has been implemented for some time, in the form of
<tt>reservation_object</tt> structures attached to DMA buffers.  The TTM
memory manager (used with the AMD and Nouveau drivers) has always supported
it; other drivers are picking up support over time.  This is the model
preferred by the Linux desktop; both X and Wayland expect implicit fencing.
<p>
On the other hand, the Android system wants to use explicit fencing.  It
provides more control to user space and reduces the need for complexity in
(vendor-supplied) graphics drivers.  That was the driving factor in
Android's decision, Vetter said; no vendor proved able to implement
implicit fences correctly.  The DRM subsystem <a
href="/Articles/702339/">implements an 
explicit fence</a> as a <tt>sync_file</tt> structure, which is returned to user
space as a file descriptor.  User-space fences will be supported in the 4.9
kernel; the MSM/freedreno driver has added support so far.

<p>
As one might imagine, there is some tricky interaction between implicit and
explicit fences.  The solution that has been chosen is to use implicit
fences by default, but to switch to the explicit model as soon as an
application calls one of the explicit-fencing extensions.
<p>
Google has created the "HWC2" composer that can make use of DRM's
explicit-fencing support; it is not yet publicly released, Vetter said,
but will hopefully show up in 4.10.  More information will be available at
the Linux Plumbers Conference.  Sometime soon it will be possible to run
Android on a mainline kernel with an open-source graphics stack, he said.
<p>
Along those lines, what is the status of low-level GPU drivers?  At this
point, there are three vendor-supported open drivers in the mainline, and
three more reverse-engineered ones.  Of those, the Nouveau driver runs
fairly well on Tegra systems.  The freedreno driver is "pretty
feature-complete" and is now competitive with proprietary drivers.  The
<a href="https://github.com/etnaviv">etnaviv</a> driver is coming along,
but still needs work on the user-space 
side.  But, he said, there are still no vendor-supported system-on-chip
drivers; that situation is "pretty dire."
<p>
He finished up by noting that the atomic API now "rules them all."  There
has been a lot of progress in documentation and general cleanup; all of the
major gaps for authors of display drivers have been closed.  Cross-driver
fencing is reaching a point of being ready for everyone, and even rendering
is showing some (albeit slow) progress.  Upstream graphics, he said, is
finally winning.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I might have mangled this a bit, but what I wanted to say is that there's now 2 vendors support open gfx drivers completely: Intel&amp;AMD, plus broadcom doing an open driver for the rasberry pi (but none of the other gpus they have). That means no vendor who covers the full spectrum of socs with vendor-support open drivers. That makes running anything like a phone or tablet pretty painful, since it's all reverse-engineered drivers. But the good news at least is that there's more of those reverse engieneered drivers, and their progressing pretty briskly.<br>

I really want to believe things are changing for the better, but in my experience, especially xf86-video-intel is still a buggy mess (partially because everyone has to grab some random commit due to the slow rate of release) and Mesa has some pretty bad things to it (such as about 10 different IRs for shaders). Last I heard, Intel's developers also didn't even have access to the latency/throughput info of the GPU instructions, so the shader optimisations in their compiler is all based on counting instructions.<br>
<p>
The kernel-space components of graphics accelerators may be getting better, but as the article itself says, 90% of it runs in userspace.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; xf86-video-intel is still a buggy mess (partially because everyone has to grab some random commit due to the slow rate of release)</font><br>
<p>
As I understand it, the current recommendation is to use xf86-video-modesetting rather than xf86-video-intel, at least for the last several generations of Intel graphics chips. I switched over a couple of months ago in an attempt to resolve some annoying visual glitches and haven't experienced any difficulties since.<br>

<p>
Not that I've noticed. It has the same VSYNC capability as the other drivers, and shouldn't tear as long as the application/compositor employs double-buffering. IIRC the intel driver had a special option to minimize tearing (for single-buffered, non-composited outputs?) but I didn't have that enabled to begin with.<br>

I've seen tearing happen with a double-buffering compositor on intel without the "TearFree" option, which disappeared with the "TearFree" option, so I have my doubts as to whether the intel documentation is accurate.<br>

Double buffering is not the way to fix tearing.<br>

The Intel driver has the right OpenGL support to allow<br>

<p>
Sure, but unless your drawing is trivial you're going to need double-buffering in order to finish changing the display between the start of VSYNC and when the new image is scanned out. To avoid limiting your rendering time to a small fraction of the frame time, you draw on a back buffer and swap buffers during the VSYNC. If this is implemented correctly there won't be any tearing.<br>
<p>
One could implement double-buffering without synchronizing on VSYNC, but why? It isn't much easier and causes pointless tearing artifacts. One can also avoid tearing without double-buffering, but only if one is willing to leave the GPU mostly idle and only render during the VSYNC interval.<br>
<p>
IIRC, the TearFree option in the intel driver essentially was double-buffering the screen (for the internal 2D acceleration path), giving the same effect as a double-buffered OpenGL compositor, or the GLAMOR code used with the modesetting driver to provide 2D acceleration via the 3D drivers.<br>

Mostly spot on, but glamor doesn't have any double buffering or other tearing prevention functionality itself, nor does the modesetting driver have any TearFree functionality. The only way to reliably avoid tearing with the modesetting driver is via DRI2/3 page flipping. I suspect the reason somebody was seeing tearing with the intel driver but not with modesetting is that the former still doesn't enable DRI3 by default, and the DRI2 mechanism for partial screen updates inherently tears. <br>
<p>
(Shameless plug: The xf86-video-amdgpu/ati drivers for AMD/ATI Radeon GPUs enable DRI3 by default with current xserver and have optional TearFree functionality which works on top of glamor or EXA, and in the upcoming releases to go with xserver 1.19 can prevent tearing with any supported display configuration (including rotation and general transformations, and RandR 1.4 style multihead))<br>

The other thing I've picked up on - if you have two displays - they can have different VSYNC but could only report one to the video subsystem. So if the screen you're drawing to has the other one, it's impossible to synchronise even if you want to ...<br>

That's not an issue per se for the compositor, because DRI page flipping flips the buffers for each display during its respective vertical blank period, so there's no tearing.<br>

And it works very nicely. I had my heart in my throat when updating to a glamor-capable X server on my Radeon (BARTS) box, but it worked perfectly, zero problems, despite using things like multihead that are almost guaranteed to have been less tested.

Which is comparing apples-to-oranges. The reason you got tearing on -intel was that the compositor choose to using a tearing path, using a method that is not available on -modesetting. Up until you get buffer hand off from client to server to compositor and back to the server (or combine the compositor and server into one) and pass the damage along the way from client to display hardware, you will have to choose a compromise.<br>

For the record, the compositor was gnome-shell in both instances (version 3.20 -- in the first case from the gnome3-staging PPA for Ubuntu 16.04, in the second case from the main Ubuntu 16.10 archive).<br>
<p>
My dual-head layout has screens of different sizes (1366x768 internal LCD, 1280x1024 external LCD) and I have them positioned side-by-side with their bottoms aligned.  The tearing I saw while moving a window showed up near the top of the external screen.<br>
<p>
I think whatever-system-component-was-responsible-for-VSYNCing was VSYNCing with the internal LCD, which resulted in tearing on the external LCD.<br>

I don't understand any of the subtleties, I'm just happy to have the tearing gone.<br>

Ymmv, bugzilla has plenty of visual glitches, GPU hangs and crashes for -modesetting.<br>

Please note that for the past couple of years, the primary cause of visual glitches for -intel has been the kernel.<br>

You'd be forgiven for not finding it — the modesetting driver comes with Xorg 1.18+ now, not as a standalone driver package.<br>
<p>
I think they could've made a little more noise about the “1 driver + Mesa = fully functional modern desktop” aspect… between this and libinput it seems like the biggest advancement of this release cycle, maybe even the year.<br>

Pixel C was Google's doing, and nvidia got dragged along kicking and screaming. It also still uses closed-source blobs in userspace, making it (in my book at least) not really open source&amp;upstream graphics support. That's why I did not count nvidia as a company supporting upstream graphics.<br>

Not sure I fumbled this in the presentation or not, but the fbdev subsystem isn't better for low power and at saving memory bandwidth than drm. The manual-upload display stuff I talked about is a property of the hardware, and drm of course supports it. What is new is support in the drm helper library for fbdev backwards compatibility for this (called "defio" in fbdev speak), implemented using the existing drm support for manual upload panels. This means when you write a driver for such hardware you now only need to write the manual upload code once (for drm core) instead of twice (drm core plus fbdev). This way you get fbdev uabi backwards compatibility pretty much for free when writing a drm driver.<br>
<p>
Really the only reason fbdev is still around is that it exists and provides uabi, and uabi sticks around forever ;-)<br>

The explicit/implicit fencing issue reminds me of the two other areas where supporting both models would be a win for users: 1) readiness vs completion and 2) push vs pull<br>
Unlike with the graphics subsystem, we've not made much progress in enabling those paradigms.<br>
I'm not complaining, btw, it just struck me as a curious pattern.<br>

The documentation has no link to the underlying repository (that I can find) or any link to contact someone to report errors. This is pretty annoying since most of the links in the table of contents on the left side are broken. e.g. <a href="https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/media/media_uapi.html">https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/media/media_uapi.html</a> reports 404 Not Found (as of writing this post).<br>

Seems like a bug in our upload scripts. Wrt making kernel docs more approachable overall: I think Jon Corbet is working on tying all the "how to contribute stuff to the kernel" into one section, atm it's still all spread over different places. That should hopefully address your question.<br>

This should be helpful. Especially if it highlights different ways to contact people for different levels of engagement. It's not appetizing to subscribe to the LKML firehose just to report that the documentation hasn't uploaded correctly. Or that the LKML.org FAQ (<a href="https://www.tux.org/lkml/">https://www.tux.org/lkml/</a>)[1] appears to be missing As it is, I'm  glad you happened to see my comment.<br>
<p>
Otherwise, the docs look great!<br>

It's nice to see the Linux graphics stack is such a good shape. It benefits a wide range of applications: the "traditional" desktop (GNOME, KDE, …), ChromeOS, mobile, embedded, IVI, TVs, … There is hope for the future. But "The year of the Linux desktop" will probably be with ChromeOS, sadly (i.e. not fully open).<br>

<p>
Random number generation in the kernel has garnered a lot of attention over
the years.  The tensions between the need for cryptographic-strength random
numbers versus getting strong random numbers more quickly—along with the need
to avoid regressions—has led to something of a patchwork of APIs.  While it
is widely agreed that waiting for a properly initialized random number
generator (RNG) before producing random numbers is the proper course,
opinions differ on what "properly" means exactly.  Beyond that, waiting,
especially early in the boot process, can be problematic as well.  One
solution would be to trust the RNG instructions provided by most modern
processors, but that comes with worries of its own.
</p>

<p>
Theodore Ts'o <a href="/Articles/760121/">posted a patch</a> on
July&nbsp;17 to add a kernel configuration option that would explicitly
trust the CPU vendor's hardware RNG (e.g. the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RdRand"><tt>RDRAND</tt> instruction</a> 
for x86).  Kernels built with <tt>RANDOM_TRUST_CPU</tt> will immediately
initialize the random number pool using the architecture's facility,
without waiting for enough entropy to accumulate from other sources;  this
means that the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"><tt>getrandom()</tt> 
system call</a> will not block.  Waiting for systems to gather enough
entropy <a href="/Articles/693189/">has been a problem in the past</a>,
especially for virtual machines and 
embedded systems where such entropy can be difficult to find.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the kernel uses CPU-provided random number instructions as part
of the process of mixing data into the entropy pool, without
crediting any entropy to it; the patch would go further than that.  Instead
of waiting for enough entropy to be gathered at boot time, it would simply
initialize the pool from the output of <tt>RDRAND</tt> (or other similar
instructions).  As Ts'o put it in the patch: "<q>I'm not sure Linux
distro's will thank us for this.  The problem is  
 trusting the CPU [manufacturer] can be an emotional / political issue.</q>"
</p>

<p>
There are <a
href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.cryptography.randombit/4689">some</a>
who would rather these hardware RNG instructions not be used 
<i>at all</i> for kernel random numbers.  But blocking in
<tt>getrandom()</tt> can lead to user space being unable to get random
numbers as quickly as needed.  By providing a configuration option, the
kernel developers neatly avoid making a decision on whether to trust these
hardware RNG instructions, but that leaves the decision to the
distributions:
<div class="BigQuote">
Even if I were convinced that Intel hadn't backdoored RDRAND (or an
 NSA agent backdoored RDRAND for them) such that the NSA had a NOBUS
 (nobody but us) capability to crack RDRAND generated numbers, if we
 made a change to unconditionally trust RDRAND, then I didn't want the
 upstream kernel developers to have to answer the question, "why are
 you willing to trust Intel, but you aren't willing to trust a company
 owned and controlled by a PLA [People's Liberation Army] general?"  (Or a
 company owned and 
 controlled by one of Putin's Oligarchs, if that makes you feel
 better.)
<p>
 With this patch, we don't put ourselves in this position --- but we
 do put the Linux distro's in this position [instead].  The upside is it
 gives the choice to each person building their own Linux kernel to
 decide whether trusting RDRAND is worth it to avoid hangs due to
 userspace trying to get cryptographic-grade entropy early in the boot
 process.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Sandy Harris <a href="/Articles/760614/">wondered</a> if there should be a
value associated with the option, which would say how many bits of entropy
the user 
thinks should be credited per 32-bit value from the hardware RNG.  But
Ts'o <a href="/Articles/760615/">pointed out</a> that his patch (which has
a code diff roughly the same size as the text for its configuration option)
does not 
mess with the entropy estimation.  In any case, he is skeptical that kind
of knob would truly be useful:
<div class="BigQuote">
In practice I doubt most people would be able to deal with a numerical
dial, and I'm trying to [encourage] people to use getrandom(2).  I view
/dev/random as a legacy interface, and for most people a CRNG
[Cryptographic-strength RNG] is quite 
sufficient.  For those people who are super paranoid and want a "true
random number generator" (and the meaning of that is hazy) because a
CRNG  is Not Enough, my recommendation these
days is that they get 
something like an open hardware RNG solution, such as <a
href="https://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/">ChaosKey</a> from 
Altus Metrum.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Other external hardware RNG devices were also mentioned as possibilities in
the thread.  
</p>

<p>
In case distributors choose to enable this in their kernels,  Yann Droneaud <a
href="/Articles/760617/">would like to see</a> a kernel command-line option
to disable it.  That would likely make it easier for distributions to build
kernels with it enabled since their users would have a way to override it
without 
building their own kernel.  Ts'o did not reply to that particular request
directly, but his patch is meant as an RFC, so perhaps we will see that in
the next version.  In response to Droneaud, he did elaborate, including
some thoughts on threat models: 
<div class="BigQuote">
 The trust model that we're
using is this.  The presumption is that (at least for US-based CPU
[manufacturers]) the amount of effort needed to add a [blatant] backdoor
to, say, the instruction scheduler and register management file is
such that it couldn't be done by a single engineer, or even a very
small set of engineers.  Enough people would need to know about it, or
would be able to figure out something untowards was happening, or it
would be obvious through various regression tests, that it would be
obvious if there was a generic back door in the CPU itself.  This is a
good thing, because ultimately we *have* to trust the general purpose
CPU.  If the CPU is actively conspiring against you, there really is
no hope.
<p>
However, the RDRAND unit is a small, self-contained thing, which is
*documented* to use an AES whitener (e.g., it does an AES encryption
as its last step).  So presumably, a change to make the RDRAND unit
effectively be:
<pre>
	AES_ENCRYPT(NSA_KEY, COUNTER++)
</pre>
Is much easier to hide or introduce.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Laura Abbott was <a href="/Articles/760621/">set to test</a> the patch on a
Fedora Rawhide kernel, but found that the hang at boot time waiting for
random numbers had been fixed some other way.  But she did think the option
was a 
good idea:
<div class="BigQuote">
That said, I do think this is a beneficial option to have available
because it actually fixes the underlying problem instead of hoping
nobody else decides to block early in the bootup process.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It is a simple change, though likely somewhat controversial—for
distributions anyway.  Another approach might be to simply change the
kernel to always 
allow boot-time selection of whether to trust the CPU's hardware RNG.
Defaulting that to "do not trust" would effectively leave things as they
are today, but give users a way to decide for themselves—and take
distributions off the hot seat if one truly exists.

Along the same lines, it'd be interesting to see a patch that makes getrandom into a VDSO call that can optionally just call RDRAND *directly* and never even enter the kernel.<br>

It's not that easy. An application that uses the output of RDRAND without mixing it with other sources of randomness is insecure.<br>

None of the comments you link to seem to back up your claim. A bunch of people seem to be paranoid that Intel might be willing to throw away all good will they will ever have, to introduce a back door that will be found one day, in RDRAND. That seems like extreme paranoia to me, against the genuine problem of many machines today not producing good enough random numbers at startup.<br>

There's also a significant difference between "insecure" and "secure if (and only if) you trust Intel". Even if you don't trust Intel, you shouldn't ignore that distinction.<br>
<p>
And if you don't trust Intel, XORing the output of RDRAND with other random data won't save you. <a href="https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo03.pdf">https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo03.pdf</a> (warning: large PDF) chapter 6 shows how a CPU (or CPU emulator in their case) could backdoor /dev/urandom by making RDRAND detect the data that the kernel is going to XOR it with, then have RDRAND return that data XOR some target string, so the final output from /dev/urandom is simply that target string. And of course a CPU backdoor could do the same even to code that *doesn't* use RDRAND, with just a little more effort to detect where to insert its malicious behaviour. You can't get away from the need to trust your hardware.<br>

      <p>Of course, as Ted T'so has already said, there are degrees of trust in Intel. Changing the AES whitener in RDRAND to be non-random is plausibly simple enough that you only need to compromise one to five individuals (as the final behaviour is not "weird" - it's expected behaviour that happens to be compromised) in order to have control of RDRAND's output; changing the CPU to detect the kernel data as per the "PoC || GTFO" paper requires you to comprise dozens to hundreds of individuals, so that the "weird" behaviour is not noticed during validation.
<p>So, you can trust that a mass compromise of Intel is not going to happen, while still being concerned that two or three individuals are working against you.

Was it Ritchie, Thompson, Kernigan, or someone else who posited a C compiler which recognized when it was compiling itself and inserted the self-recognition code along with backdoor code?<br>

The only problem with this is that it means that it could be changed by an evil maid.  I think it should be a choice, forced permanent into the kernel (on or off) or as a kernel command line parameter if you've got a way to trust the bootloader (though if you don't trust the bootloader....)<br>

Well, the kernel PRNG doesn't just forward the hardware RNG to userspace, it's hashed. Since AFAIK nobody has ever found a repeated kernel RNG stream, there's no wall clock inside the CPU, and the hash function hasn't been compromised (otherwise we'd be in deep shit anyway), frankly I fail to see what the paranoia is all about.<br>

If there were, say, 2**64 different possible RDRAND streams, then that'd be large enough that people would be unlikely to notice a duplicate without extensive effort, but still entirely possible for someone like the NSA to precompute all the hashed getrandom() output streams.<br>

I want to make sure I understand the implications of this correctly.<br>
<p>
What are the circumstances (if any) in which Intel's RNG will be passed back to userspace unaltered? Is there a way I can make sure my system _always_ combines multiple sources of entropy? Is there a way I can completely remove RdRand from the equation? I'm not saying I necessarily want to, I'm just trying to make sure my understanding is correct.<br>

From the linked email:<br>

<p>
The LWN article implies that someone is objecting to using RDRAND at all (even if mixed in with other sources).  The linked complaint is about using *only* RDRAND ("allow ... RdRand to bypass the entropy pool").  Seems a bit disingenuous for LWN to word it the way they did...<br>

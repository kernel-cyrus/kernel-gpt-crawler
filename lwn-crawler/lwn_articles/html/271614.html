<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 3, 2008</br>
           </div>
Thomas Gleixner has discovered that being the maintainer of a core kernel
infrastructure module can bring some special challenges.  Whenever
somebody's kernel oopses in the timer code, for example, Thomas tends to
hear about it.  The only problem is that the timer code is almost never
where the bug is.  Instead, it's far more likely that some other kernel
subsystem has corrupted an active timer, leaving a bomb that will only
explode later, in the timer code, when that timer is set to expire.  At
that point, it can be hard to figure out where the real problem is, as the
culprit will be long gone.
<p>

In response, Thomas developed some special-purpose code aimed at finding
the real source of timer-related problems, preferably before it brings down
the kernel.  He has now generalized that code and posted it as the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/271582/">object debugging infrastructure
patch</a>, which was subsequently <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/271808/">significantly revised</a>.  As this
code develops, it has the potential to help find whole classes of
especially difficult bugs before they bring the system down.  <p>

There's a few steps involved in adding support for object debugging to a
new subsystem.  The first is to create and populate a
<tt>debug_obj_descr</tt> structure (defined in
<tt>&lt;linux/debugobjects.h&gt;</tt>):
<p>
<pre>
    struct debug_obj_descr {
	const char		*name;

	int (*fixup_init)	(void *addr, enum debug_obj_state state);
	int (*fixup_activate)	(void *addr, enum debug_obj_state state);
	int (*fixup_destroy)	(void *addr, enum debug_obj_state state);
	int (*fixup_free)	(void *addr, enum debug_obj_state state);
    };
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>name</tt> field is the name of the subsystem; it is used in
debugging output.  We will return to the other fields below.
<p>
The next step is to call into the object debugging code whenever an action
of interest involves one of the tracked objects.  There is a set of
functions used for this purpose:
<p>
<pre>
    void debug_object_init      (void *addr, struct debug_obj_descr *descr);
    void debug_object_activate  (void *addr, struct debug_obj_descr *descr);
    void debug_object_deactivate(void *addr, struct debug_obj_descr *descr);
    void debug_object_destroy   (void *addr, struct debug_obj_descr *descr);
    void debug_object_free      (void *addr, struct debug_obj_descr *descr);
</pre>
<p>
In each case, <tt>addr</tt> is a pointer to the object being operated on,
and <tt>descr</tt> is a pointer to the <tt>debug_obj_descr</tt> structure
mentioned above.  The meaning of each call is:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>debug_object_init()</tt>: the object is being initialized.
<p>
<li> <tt>debug_object_activate()</tt>: it is being added to a subsystem list.  For 
     timer debugging, this action happens when <tt>add_timer()</tt> is
     called.
<p>
<li> <tt>debug_object_deactivate()</tt>: the object is being removed from a subsystem
     list.
<p>
<li> <tt>debug_object_destroy()</tt>: the object is being destroyed and is
     no longer referenced within the subsystem.  This call is not 
     used in the version&nbsp;2 patch set.
<p>
<li> <tt>debug_object_free()</tt>: the object is being freed.
</ul>
<p>
The debugging code maintains a hashed set of lists for tracking objects;
each object is added to the appropriate list when one of the above calls is
made.  As actions are performed on the objects, their state is tracked.  
In this way, the debugging code
is able to test for a number of common mistakes, including deactivating an
object which is not active, reinitializing active objects, or adding
objects twice.
<p>

When something goes wrong, a backtrace is sent to the system logs.  Since
this backtrace identifies where the original error is made, it is likely to
be far more useful than the trace associated with the system crash which
will probably come later.  But this infrastructure can also help to make
that crash less likely, in that each subsystem can register a set of "fixup
functions."  These, of course, are all the methods in the
<tt>debug_obj_descr</tt> structure which we glossed over above.
<p>

For example, if a call to <tt>debug_object_init()</tt> is made with an
object which has already been activated, the debugging infrastructure will
respond with a call to the <tt>fixup_init()</tt> callback, passing in the
object in question and its current state (<tt>ODEBUG_STATE_ACTIVE</tt> in
this case).  The callback should return zero if it is able to,
somehow, repair the damage.  Even if things cannot be truly fixed, though,
there is still use for this function; the timer code, for example, will
disable an active timer if the calling code mishandles it.  The kernel will
almost certainly not operate as expected, but, at least, it has a smaller
chance of crashing at some random time in the future.
<p>
Most debugging checks are performed in response to calls from within the
subsystem itself.  There is one useful check which cannot be done that way,
though: detecting the freeing of objects which are still under some sort of
subsystem management.  To catch that mistake, Thomas's patch inserts a hook
into functions like <tt>kfree()</tt> and <tt>free_hot_cold_page()</tt>.
Every time an object is freed, the code checks through the appropriate list
to see if it is still seen as being active in some subsystem.
Freeing an object which is still known to a subsystem is almost always a
bug - one which can be hard to track down later on.
<p>
The check on freed memory objects is clearly a useful debugging tool.  It could also have a
nontrivial overhead, though, since it requires searching a list every time
some memory is freed.  So it has its own configuration option and can be
configured out of the kernel, even if the rest of the debugging code is
built in.
<p>
At this point, only the timer subsystem is covered by this infrastructure,
but there are plenty of other obvious candidates.  Perhaps at the top of the
list would be kobjects, which are famously susceptible to all kinds
of programming mistakes.  So expect to see the coverage of this code grow
in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>This article is a good example of the mistake of explaining something starting with the abstract.  People don't develop complex ideas that way, and they can't learn them best that way either.  People develop complex ideas by starting with concrete examples.  In this case, Gleixner started with some timer usage bug.  You add more and more examples, abstracting along the way to accomodate them.  Other timer bugs, hypothetical further timer bugs and bugs in other areas, etc.  That's how the human brain forms concepts.
<p>
But when going to explain the new concept, the inventor often, wrongly, starts with the highest abstraction.  If you're lucky, at the end he gives you some examples.  I suppose it's a way of stressing the actual <em>invention</em>, which is the abstraction, not the collection of examples.  But it just makes it harder to see what the invention is.
<p>
I noticed that right away in this article because it talks about creating a debug_obj_descr struct, in full C detail, before I had any idea what it would be for.  Nothing to hang it on in my mind.  Then it says the next step is to call something whenever an "action of interest" involves a tracked "object," without having said what sort of actions or objects it's talking about.  Those are wide-open terms.  Much wider than what the author really has in mind.
<p>
I'd like to know just what timer related bugs this helps with.  And I suspect the facility isn't all that general after all.  The timer subsystem uses a rather unique model of communication where concepts of "add to the subsystem" and "remove from the subsystem" (again, too abstract / not defined) exist.

<h1>Runtime power management</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 19, 2009</br>
           </div>
While a great deal of power management work has been done on Linux systems
in recent years, much of that work has been directed toward the creation of
working suspend and hibernation capabilities.  But there is more to power
management than that; there is real value in being able to minimize the
power consumption of a running system.  That is as true for large data
center machines as it is for laptops; reduced power usage and lower air
conditioning requirements have both economic and environmental benefits.
Now that the suspend problem is mostly solved, increasing amounts of
attention are being paid to the other aspects of power management; some
recent patches show how the infrastructure for runtime power management is
coming together.
<p>
The core of the future power management structure appears certain to be
Rafael Wysocki's <a href="/Articles/347574/">runtime power management
patch</a>.  This patch set adds structure to the power management code to
facilitate the suspending and resuming of individual system components at
run time.  The <tt>dev_pm_ops</tt> structure is augmented with three new
functions:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*runtime_suspend)(struct device *dev);
    int (*runtime_resume)(struct device *dev);
    int (*runtime_idle)(struct device *dev);
</pre>
<p>
These functions are to be implemented by the core device code for each bus
type; they may then be turned into bus-specific driver callbacks.  The
power management code will call <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt> to prepare a
specific device for a lower-power state.  This call does not imply that the
device itself must suspend, but the device does need to prepare for a condition
where it is no longer able to communicate with the CPU or memory.  In other
words, even if the device does not suspend, hardware between that device
and the rest of the system might suspend.  A return value of <tt>-EBUSY</tt> or
<tt>-EAGAIN</tt> will abort the suspend operation.

</blockquote>
<p>

A call to <tt>runtime_resume()</tt> should prepare the device to operate
again with the rest of the system; the driver should power up the device,
restore registers, and do anything else needed to get the device
functioning again.  The <tt>runtime_idle()</tt> callback, instead, is
called when the core thinks that the device is idle and might be a good
candidate for suspending.  The callback should decide whether the device
can really be suspended (this could include checking the state of any other
devices connected to it) and, if all seems well, initiate a suspend
operation. 
<p>
Along with these callbacks is, of course, a set of core functions designed
to manage suspend and resume activities, deal with mid-course
cancellations, allow outside code to make power management changes, and so
on.  See <a href="/Articles/347575/">the associated document file</a> for
more information on how this subsystem works.
<p>
The code described above has been through several review iterations and
would appear to be on track for merging in 2.6.32.  Rafael's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/346767/">asynchronous suspend and resume
patch</a>, instead, is rather newer and may take a little longer.  The idea
behind this patch is to extend the runtime power management code to allow
suspend and resume callbacks to be invoked asynchronously; that, in turn,
would allow them to be run in parallel.  As long as there are no
dependencies between a pair of devices, suspending or resuming them in
parallel should make full-system transitions faster.
<p>
The problem is in the dependencies; running a bunch of power management
operations in parallel increases the risk of getting the order wrong.  To
avoid this outcome, the patch adds a new completion object to each device;
when a device is to be suspended, the completions will be used to ensure
that any dependent devices are suspended first.  At resume time the
completions are used in the reverse direction: devices wait for their
parent devices to be resumed before resuming themselves.  
As long as the dependency
information is correct, this mechanism should ensure that a set of power
management threads can run in parallel without breaking the system.
<p>
Ensuring that the dependencies are correct was one of the reasons for the
creation of the Linux device model years ago.  With a properly-constructed
tree, the system can know, for example, that it cannot suspend a USB
controller until all USB devices plugged into it have been suspended.  In
turn, the PCI controller to which the USB controller is attached must
remain functional until the USB controller is suspended, and so on.  The
problem is that system dependencies are not always that simple.  A PCI
device may also require the services of an I2C controller, for example, or
devices can be combined on multi-function chips in surprising ways.  So the
device tree has proved unable to represent all of the
power management dependencies in the system.
<p>
Rafael has addressed this problem in a later version of the patch, which adds
a new framework for representing power management dependencies.  At the
core of it is this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct pm_link {
    	struct device *master;
    	struct list_head master_hook;
    	struct device *slave;
    	struct list_head slave_hook;
    };
</pre>
<p>
One of these structures exists for each dependency known to the system.  It
indicates that the "master" device must always be functional whenever the
"slave" device is; the master must be suspended after the slave and resumed
before it.  Many of these links can be created by the power management core
itself; others will have to be generated by the relevant drivers.  There
have been some <a href="/Articles/347580/">concerns</a> raised about the
memory use of this structure, but a better solution has not yet been
proposed.
<p>

Meanwhile, Matthew Garrett has taken the core power management code one
step further with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/346898/">a set of
runtime power management patches</a> of his own.  He has pushed the new
power management calls down into the PCI and USB bus layers and used them
to suspend devices opportunistically as the system runs; he reports a power
savings of around 0.2&nbsp;watts as a result.  Review comments resulted in these
patches being withdrawn for now for repairs, but they show the direction
things are heading.  With sufficient software support and cooperative
hardware, Linux should be able to further reduce the operating power needed
for whole classes of systems.  That cannot fail to be a good thing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Let's say that there's around 1 billion computers, and 1% of those are running linux - so 10 million linux computers.<br>
<p>
At a saving of 0.2 Watts per machine, that's a total saving of 2 mega watts.  This is about the power output of quite a small power station.<br>

If the started power management work would stop at USB, it would be rather <br>
pointless.<br>
<p>
And for battery powered devices even that's a huge amount.  If you want <br>
the device to be able to idle for weeks, all this kind of extra power <br>
usage needs to be fixed.<br>

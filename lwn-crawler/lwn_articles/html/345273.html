           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 5, 2009</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers must keep in mind many constraints which are unique to
that programming environment; one of those is that memory
allocations become less reliable as they get larger.  Single-page
allocations will, for all practical purposes, always succeed.  A request
for two physically-contiguous pages has a high probability of working, but
each doubling of the size decreases the chances of a successful
allocation.  The fragmentation of memory which occurs over the system's
life time makes it increasingly hard to find groups of groups of
physically-contiguous pages on demand.  So large allocations are strongly
discouraged. 

<p>
Kernel programmers will sometimes respond to this problem by allocating
pages with <tt>vmalloc()</tt>.  Memory allocated this way is virtually
contiguous, but physically scattered.  So, as long as physically-contiguous
pages are not needed, <tt>vmalloc()</tt> looks like a good solution to the
problem.  It's not ideal, though.  On 32-bit systems, memory from
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> must be mapped into a relatively small address space; it's easy to
run out.  On SMP systems, the page table changes required by
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> allocations can require expensive cross-processor
interrupts on all CPUs.  And, on all systems, use of space in the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> range increases pressure on the translation lookaside
buffer (TLB), reducing the performance of the system.
<p>
So it would be nice to have a mechanism which could handle the allocation
of large arrays in a manner which (1)&nbsp;is reliable, and (2)&nbsp;does not use
<tt>vmalloc()</tt>.  To date, any such mechanisms have generally been
pieced together by developers solving a specific problem; there has been
nothing designed for more general use.  That has changed, though, with the
merging of the "flexible array" mechanism, written by Dave Hansen, for
2.6.31-rc5. 
<p>
A flexible array holds an arbitrary (within limits) number of fixed-sized
objects, accessed via an integer index.  Sparse arrays are handled
reasonably well.  Only single-page allocations are made, so memory
allocation failures should be relatively rare.  The down sides are that the
arrays cannot be indexed directly, individual object size cannot exceed the
system page size, and putting data into a flexible array
requires a copy operation.  It's also worth noting that flexible arrays do
no internal locking at all; if concurrent access to an array is possible,
then the caller must arrange for appropriate mutual exclusion.
<p>
The creation of a flexible array is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/flex_array.h&gt;

    struct flex_array *flex_array_alloc(int element_size, int total, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>

The individual object size is provided by <tt>element_size</tt>, while
<tt>total</tt> is the maximum number of objects which can be stored in the
array.  The <tt>flags</tt> argument is passed directly to the internal
memory allocation calls.  With the current code, using <tt>flags</tt> to
ask for high memory is likely to lead to notably unpleasant side effects.
<p>
Storing data into a flexible array is accomplished with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int flex_array_put(struct flex_array *array, int element_nr, void *src, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will copy the data from <tt>src</tt> into the <tt>array</tt>,
in the position indicated by <tt>element_nr</tt> (which must be less than
the maximum specified when the array was created).  If any memory allocations must be
performed, <tt>flags</tt> will be used.  The return value is zero on
success, a negative error code otherwise.
<p>
There might possibly be a need to store data into a flexible array while
running in some sort of atomic context; in this situation, sleeping
in the memory allocator would be a bad thing.  That can be avoided by using
<tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> for the <tt>flags</tt> value, but, often, there is a
better way.  The trick is to ensure that any needed memory allocations are
done before entering atomic context, using:
<p>
<pre>
    int flex_array_prealloc(struct flex_array *array, int start, int end, gfp_t flags);
</pre>
<p>
This function will ensure that memory for the elements indexed in the range
defined by <tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt> has been allocated.  Thereafter,
a <tt>flex_array_put()</tt> call on an element in that range is guaranteed
not to block.
<p>
Getting data back out of the array is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *flex_array_get(struct flex_array *fa, int element_nr);
</pre>
<p>
The return value is a pointer to the data element, or NULL if that
particular element has never been allocated.
<p>
Note that it is possible to get back a valid pointer for an element which
has never been stored in the array.  Memory for array elements is allocated
one page at a time; a single allocation could provide memory for several
adjacent elements.  The flexible array code does not know if a specific
element has been written to; it only knows if the associated memory is
present.  So a <tt>flex_array_get()</tt> call on an element which was never
stored in the array has the potential to return a pointer to random data.
If the caller does not have a separate way to know which elements were
actually stored, it might be wise, at least, to add <tt>GFP_ZERO</tt> to
the <tt>flags</tt> argument to ensure that all elements are zeroed.
<p>
There is no way to remove a single element from the array.  It is possible,
though, to remove all elements with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void flex_array_free_parts(struct flex_array *array);
</pre>
<p>
This call frees all elements, but leaves the array itself in place.
Freeing the entire array is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    void flex_array_free(struct flex_array *array);
</pre>
<p>
As of this writing, there are no users of flexible arrays in the mainline
kernel.  The functions described here are also not exported to modules;
that will probably be fixed when somebody comes up with a need for it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Seems like it should have a flag to zero just the first word (cacheline?) of each element so it's not zeroing more than needed.<br>

Just an idea, but large parts of B+ tree implementation are similar to flexible arrays / dequeues, except that B+ trees are sorted and can have a tree depth deeper than 1.<br>
<p>
I believe the Linux recently got a B+ tree implementation. I wonder if it would be possible to divide that into parts so that node handling, insert, delete and linear traversal code could be shared.<br>
<p>
It's probably not worthwhile, but I think it'd be interesting to investigate.<br>

I worked on the b+tree implementation for a while, and then we measured it but it turned out to be slower than using an rbtree, for some reason, so I don't think the b+tree got into the tree at this point. I might be wrong and have missed that tho.<br>

I believe the OP was referring to btrfs which uses a modified b+tree structure.  <br>
<p>
Also NTFS, ReiserFS, NSS, XFS, and JFS use B+trees.  I wonder if it has been implemented in a library or if there are 5 or 6 differing implementations of b+trees in the kernel...<br>

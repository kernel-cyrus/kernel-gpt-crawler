           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 16, 2016</br>
           </div>
When Kees Cook <a href="/Articles/705262/">discussed kernel hardening</a>
at the 2016 Kernel Summit, the implementation of reference-count hardening
was one of the prominent items on his list of objectives for the coming
year.  Since then, the topic has been discussed anew on the kernel mailing
lists, and reference-count hardening has run into the sorts of problems
that security-related patches often encounter: security changes are not
always a comfortable fit with the objectives of a general-purpose, widely
used kernel.  It this case, it looks like the kernel will eventually get
reference-count hardening, but not in the form that has been proposed
thus far.
<p>
When reference-count hardening was <a href="/Articles/693038/">covered
here</a> last July, most of the attention was on a PaX-derived patch set
posted by David Windsor.  More recently, this patch set has been taken over
by Elena Reshetova, who <a href="/Articles/706502/">posted a new
revision</a> on November&nbsp;10.  The basic approach taken by the patch
set has not changed: the kernel's <tt>atomic_t</tt> type, which is the
usual choice for reference-count implementations, is instrumented to detect
potential 
overflows.  When an overflow happens, warnings are issued, the offending
process is killed, and the affected counter is frozen at a high value so
that it will never return to zero.  That turns a potential use-after-free
vulnerability into a memory leak, hopefully closing off an avenue of
attack.
<p>
This time around, the patches ran into some stronger opposition, much of
which came from core developer Peter Zijlstra.  He had two fundamental
objections to the approach taken with these patches; the first of those is
that they <a href="/Articles/706506/">do not preserve the atomic nature</a>
of <tt>atomic_t</tt>, leaving code open to certain kinds of race
conditions.  This race condition, which <a href="/Articles/706512/">was
known to Cook and others</a>, could allow an attacker to bypass the
reference-count protection.  The conclusion that had been reached was that
the risk was acceptable and that, in particular, the bypass could still be
detected, even if it could not be prevented.
<p>
In a sense, the fact that this vulnerability has not been fixed in the
hardening patches can be seen as a
result of the pressure that developers of security-related patches are under.  The
vulnerability is easy to close by using a compare-and-swap instruction for
reference-count changes, but that would have an adverse effect on
performance.  Security-related code is hard enough to merge even without
performance regressions; in this case, the developers decided to stick with a
less-than-perfect implementation to avoid slowing the kernel down.  But
Zijlstra was adamant that atomic operations must be atomic, even if there is a
cost to be paid by users who want the reference-count protection.
<p>
The harder problem to solve, though, is tied to the fundamental approach
used by this patch set.  It changes the <tt>atomic_t</tt> implementation on
the assumption that most users are implementing reference counts.  It then
becomes necessary to go through the kernel, find all non-reference-count
uses of <tt>atomic_t</tt>, and switch them to an unprotected variable type.
This approach is necessary, Cook <a href="/Articles/706508/">said</a>, to
ensure that all reference-count vulnerabilities have been closed off:
"<q>We need a hardened infrastructure, not just 'stuff people can maybe
remember to use'</q>".  The only way to get there, he said, is with an
opt-out implementation.
<p>
The problem with this approach, in the eyes of the core kernel developers,
is that it requires an audit of the entire kernel to find the
non-reference-count users, and that is an error-prone process at best.
Beyond that, <tt>atomic_t</tt> <a href="/Articles/706509/">offers a wide
range of operations</a> that are not relevant to reference counts; making
them available to developers implementing reference counts is just asking
for trouble.  In this view, it is far better to create a new type for
reference counts, implement overflow protection there, and switch
reference-count users over.
<p>
Back in June, Jann Horn <a href="/Articles/692695/">suggested this
approach</a>, using the existing <tt>kref</tt> type for reference counts.
That work didn't get much further at that time, but the approach has
returned in the form of <a href="/Articles/706483/">a new patch set</a>
from Zijlstra.  Therein, he creates a new, protected <tt>refcount_t</tt>
type; it is implemented using <tt>atomic_t</tt> and provides a restricted
set of operations.  The <tt>kref</tt> implementation is then reworked to
use <tt>refcount_t</tt>, cleaning up some of the interfaces and users along
the way.  The intended end result is a well-defined way to implement
reference counts in the kernel that is difficult for developers to abuse
and which can be protected from overflow vulnerabilities.
<p>
The current reference-count hardening patch set from Reshetova touches
nearly 400 files; Zijlstra's patch set is far smaller.  To a great extent,
that is because its ambitions are far lower: it adds an infrastructure for
protecting reference counts and implements it for code that was already
using the <tt>kref</tt> type, but does nothing about the vast number of
reference-count implementations built directly on <tt>atomic_t</tt>; that
is an exercise left for others to do later.  The exercise is
straightforward, but it does involve understanding the code in question to
be sure that the switch to the new type will not introduce bugs.
<p>
Assuming that the kernel adopts Zijlstra's approach — a reasonably safe
assumption — it will end up with a reference-count protection mechanism
that runs more slowly and, initially, protects far less code than the
PaX-derived approach.  But it will also get a solution without
race-condition worries and which doesn't have the same potential to
introduce bugs into code using <tt>atomic_t</tt> for purposes other than
reference counting.  Over time, assuming developers devote some time to the
task (<i>not</i> always a good assumption, alas), vulnerable code should be
switched over and the end result, from a protection point of view, should
be the same.  For security-related patches, that sort of outcome is often
the best-case scenario, even if the developers who put much of their time
into the PaX-derived code find it less than fully gratifying.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'd say that with 17 *million* lines of code written in C in the kernel, the choice of language *is* a very good excuse not to switch to another language.<br>
<p>
Your mileage may vary, obviously.<br>
<p>
<p>
If you can find a better language that:<br>
<p>
a.) the entire current developer base feels comfortable switching to--so not C++<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
b.) put in the effort to do the rewrite on your own (because while you might be able to convince people to stick to a new language once it's been rewritten in this language, I doubt you can convince them to do the rewrite on their own) without introducing new bugs<br>
<p>
then your idea might have merit. If not it's, as I already said, moot.<br>
<p>
And if using C extensions, those extensions should at least be such that they are likely to be supported both in llvm and gcc; the safest bet is to go with features that have already been made part of the latest C standards, thus you'll have to submit your ideas to the C working group and wait at least 5-10 years, assuming your ideas are good.<br>

Well, that's just silly. Neither C++ nor GCC extensions (which are pretty universally supported by clang) really require any kind of rewrite of existing code. Moreover, I believe the kernel devs are pretty clear that no other compilers are or need to be supported.<br>

<p>
That seems an unhelpfully strict requirement. Today, not the whole developer base is comfortable with the kernel being written in C - some would be much happier with a language that had features to make it easier to write correct code and harder to write buggy code. Of course there are also people who would be much less happy with anything other than C. Any choice of action or inaction will attract some people and alienate others; it'd be best to consider whether, on balance (accounting for the effects on current developers and potential future developers and the objective benefits of the language itself), that would improve the long-term prospects of the kernel.<br>
<p>
But I expect the people with the power to make those decisions are nearly all people who'd be less happy with any other language, and (since they're human) they're obviously not going to choose to alienate themselves for some hard-to-quantify long-term benefits to the project, so in practice nothing is going to change.<br>

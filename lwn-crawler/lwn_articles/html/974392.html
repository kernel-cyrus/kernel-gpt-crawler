Looking up a virtual memory area (VMA) in a process's address space, for
the handling of page faults or any of a number of other tasks, in
multi-threaded processes has long been bedeviled by lock contention in the
kernel.  As a result, developer gatherings have been subjected to many
sessions on how to improve the situation.  At the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, developers in the
memory-management track met, in a session led by Liam Howlett, to talk
about a situation that has improved considerably in recent times, but which
still offers opportunities for optimization.
<p>
Howlett began by referring back to <a href="/Articles/893906/">a 2022
LSFMM+BPF session</a> where Mel Gorman had suggested performing locking
during the VMA-walk process at the VMA level itself, rather than locking
the whole VMA tree.
At that level, Gorman
thought, the level of contention would be far less.  In current kernels,
Howlett said, that is what happens; the fault-handling code will first try
locking the VMA tree with the read-copy-update (RCU) read lock, only
falling back to the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> if it has to.  The VMA of interest
can be locked individually once it is located; after the fault is handled,
the code calls <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/include/linux/mm.h#L762"><tt>release_fault_lock()</tt></a>,
which will either drop the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> or the RCU lock as
appropriate.  It is not the most elegant solution, he said, but it does
hide the details nicely.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/974394/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/LiamHowlett-sm.png" alt="[Liam Howlett]"
title="Liam Howlett" class="rthumb"></a>

With regard to performance, he noted that fault-handling actually got
slower in the kernels between 5.19 and 6.2 as this work began; distributors
were starting to get nervous, he said.  But then, in 6.4, the <a
href="/Articles/906852/">per-VMA locking</a> work went in, and performance
doubled.  By the time 6.6 came around, fault handling was almost three
times better than it had been before the work began, a result that he called
"pretty awesome".
<p>
For code that needs to walk through the page tables in current kernels, he
said, the common pattern is to take the RCU read lock before locating the
specific VMA of interest.  Code can then call <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/mm/memory.c#L5744"><tt>lock_vma_under_rcu()</tt></a>
to try to take the VMA-specific lock and ensure that the VMA does not go
away until the work is done.  That attempt could fail, though, so code has
to be prepared to fall back to <tt>mmap_lock</tt> in that case.  Page-fault
handling is trickier, though, especially for unpopulated, anonymous memory.
In that case, the code may need to examine the neighboring VMAs, and the
per-VMA lock won't cover them.  Locking multiple VMAs is a quick path to
deadlocks, so that is not really an option.  The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
subsystem adds its own special cases as well.
<p>
For anybody else writing code that works through the page tables, he said,
looking at the RCU-protected approach rather than taking the contended
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> would make sense.  There is still a need to work out the
best API for all of the use cases out there, though.
<p>
There is also a little problem in that the VMA tree is not atomic in the
absence of <tt>mmap_lock</tt>.  Holding the per-VMA lock will keep the VMA
from going away, but some changes may appear in intermediate states.  For
example, if an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>munmap()</tt></a>
call has to split a VMA, the splitting will become visible before the
unmapping does.  Matthew Wilcox said that developers need to better define
what is being promised; if you found the VMA under the RCU lock, the VMA
will continue to exist, but it might not still be a part of the process's
address space.  Suren Baghdasaryan added that some fields of the VMA,
including the file pointer, are not stable under RCU.
<p>
The discussion (and the first day) ended with a winding discussion on one
of the use cases driving this work: making <span style="white-space:
nowrap"><tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</tt></span> have less impact on the
system.  There are systems out there with a high-priority process doing
work, and a low-priority monitoring process that occasionally needs to read
that file.  If the low-priority process takes memory-management locks that
block the high-priority process, the result is the sort of priority
inversion that makes users unhappy.
<p>
Having <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</tt> work under the RCU lock prevents that
sort of inversion, but at the cost that the VMA tree might change while the
file is being read.  The contents of that file can always be out of date
even in current kernels,
since the situation can change immediately after it is read, but now it
could also be internally inconsistent.  There was some debate over how much
of a problem that actually is.  There various suggestions of returning
sequence numbers that user space could use to detect this situation, or
detecting it in the kernel and retrying, perhaps taking the
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> after a few failures to ensure that the job gets done.
The session came to a close with no definitive conclusions.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<h1>Introducing utrace</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 7, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The interface for tracing programs under Linux is the <tt>ptrace()</tt>
system call.  It is used primarily by debuggers, but there are other
applications too; User-mode Linux can use <tt>ptrace()</tt>, for example.
The interface gets the job done, but there are few system calls which
endure more criticism.  The list of <tt>ptrace()</tt> shortcomings is long,
its interface is difficult for user-space developers to use and for
kernel-space developers to maintain, it is inefficient, and it has been the
source of more than one security problem over the years.  Still,
<tt>ptrace()</tt> endures; it is part of the user-space API and there is
nothing better available.
<p>

Soon there may be a better alternative, in the form of the "utrace" patch
(by Roland McGrath) which is currently in the -mm tree.  Utrace replaces
<tt>ptrace()</tt> entirely, while maintaining the same interface to user
space.  As such, it is a useful cleanup of a difficult system call.  The
real value of utrace, however, is likely to be seen in new tracing
interfaces in the future.
<p>

The core utrace code does not interface with user space at all; instead, it
is an in-kernel API which can be used to build kernel-based tracing
mechanisms.  These mechanisms are based around the concept of a "tracing
engine," which is defined by the usual structure full of method pointers.
This structure (<tt>struct utrace_engine_ops</tt>) has fourteen callbacks,
each covering something which the traced process might do or have done to
it.  For example, one callback is:
<p>
<pre>
    u32 (*report_syscall_entry)(struct utrace_attached_engine *engine,
				struct task_struct *tsk,
				struct pt_regs *regs);
</pre>
<p>
Whenever the traced process invokes a system call, the tracing engine will
(if it has asked for this event) receive a call to its
<tt>report_syscall_entry()</tt> callback.  The call happens at a "safe"
time before the system call is executed; no locks are held, and the tracing
process can safely access the traced process's state.  The callback returns
a bitmask specifying what happens next; the bitmask can change the tracing
state, detach the engine, hide the event from other tracing engines, and
more.
<p>
A tracing engine is put into service with:
<p>
<pre>
    struct utrace_attached_engine *
    utrace_attach(struct task_struct *target, int flags,
	      	  const struct utrace_engine_ops *ops, 
		  unsigned long data);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attach the engine to the given <tt>target</tt> process.
There can be more than one engine attached to any given process - a
significant difference from <tt>ptrace()</tt>.  A newly-attached engine
does not actually do anything, one can think of it as being in an idling
state.  Putting the engine into gear requires setting one or more action
flags with:
<p>
<pre>
    int utrace_set_flags(struct task_struct *target,
			 struct utrace_attached_engine *engine,
			 unsigned long flags);
</pre>
<p>
There is a special flag (<tt>UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE)</tt>) which puts the
target process into a quiescent state.  In general, operating on the task
first requires setting this flag, then waiting for a callback (to the
<tt>report_quiesce()</tt> engine method) that says the process is truly
stopped.  There is a whole other set of events which can be requested:
forking, execing a new program, receiving a signal, process death, system
call entry and exit, etc.  Single-stepping through instructions and program
blocks is also handled through the event mechanism.
<p>
A signal can  be forced into the target process with:
<p>
<pre>
    int utrace_inject_signal(struct task_struct *target,
			     struct utrace_attached_engine *engine,
			     u32 action, siginfo_t *info,
			     const struct k_sigaction *ka);
</pre>
<p>
Signals injected in this manner are delivered to the target process
immediately; they are not queued in the usual manner.
<p>
There is more to the utrace API than is described in this brief overview,
including an API for describing and working with CPU registers;
see <a href="/Articles/224779/">the excellent documentation file</a>
packaged with the patch for more details.  Also included with the patch is
a complete reimplementation of <tt>ptrace()</tt> built on top of utrace.
<p>
Reimplementing <tt>ptrace()</tt> is only so interesting, however, even if
the result is a big improvement.  The real purpose behind utrace looks to
be to inspire the creation of the next generation of user-space process
tracing APIs, and more.  Roland told your editor:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The intent of the utrace API is not just to facilitate my writing
	the one great new userland API to replace ptrace.  Its core purpose
	is to put writing a new user debugging facility more on par with
	writing a software device driver, a filesystem, or a network stack,
	so that many people can come up with ideas and experiment without
	doing brain surgery every time.  It ties up the really nasty
	low-level implementation issues, and lets different unrelated
	facilities coexist without interfering with each other.
</div>
<p>
In other words, while utrace should enable the eventual retirement of
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, there is more coming than that.  If and when utrace
makes it into the mainline, look for it to inspire interesting developments
in a number of areas.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      There is already an open source tool providing many of the DTrace capabilities called SystemTap which was started a couple of years ago by a group of developers from Red Hat, IBM, Intel &amp; Hitachi:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/</a><br>
<p>
Currently SystemTap is focused on kernelspace probing, via the kprobes capability. This new UTrace infrastructure has potential as a way to let SystemTap probe userspace too. Another project which may be able to make use of UTrace is Frysk, which is a broader userspace debugger / execution analysis tool:<br>

      Two questions come to mind regarding this.<br>
<p>
Could systrace be reworked to use the utrace framework? (Because the<br>
semantics around the example specified that no locks were held and<br>
the process' memory was quiescent at the syscall entry ... prior<br>
to execution).  I'd love to see systrace merged into the mainline.<br>
<p>
The other question would be if it would be possible to built an I/O<br>
metrics patch around this.  For years I've wished that we'd get the<br>
atop I/O metrics (kernel-patch-atopcnt package on Debian) merged.<br>
Often enough, when we see that a system is I/O bound, we want to know<br>
which process(es) is (are) hogging which I/O channel(s).  A utrace<br>
approach wouldn't be the same (wouldn't be feasible for an atop like<br>
tool).  However, it could be used to selectively check on the I/O<br>
behavior of specific processes ... to perform spot checks and undergo<br>
a process of elimination.<br>

      Does this not go against the Linux philosophy of not having unnecessary* layers of abstraction present in the kernel? I seem to remember not so long ago this being used as a (reason|excuse) for a device driver not being included in mainline.<br>
<p>
* This layer, I believe from my limited perspective, isn't "necessary", right?<br>

      You're thinking of HALs. Vendors writing device drivers often introduce a Hardware Abstraction Layer so that their driver can work on any OS just by writing a new HAL. That simplifies life for the vendor, but complicates each individual OS driver.<br>
<p>
In fact, just like cross-platform GUIs, HALs usually end up being "lowest common denominator". Therefore, the driver isn't likely to use Linux the most effecient way. It also makes it harder for the kernel maintainers: You have to take time to understand each new HAL, instead of just knowing the existing driver APIs.<br>
<p>
utrace is more of a plug-in mechanisim than a new layer.<br>

FYI FC{5,6} kernels include utrace by default since about 6mo ago, effectively making FC stock kernels unusable for UML deploys :-( , <br>

      According to Jeff Dike "UML runs on the utrace in -mm (i.e. utrace on the host), which it didn't with several Fedora kernels." and he is working on a utrace port for UML itself:<br>

      It seems to me like this could be useful for situations where the kernel wants to monitor and control tasks internally. I could imagine using it to handle suspend/resume, where the suspend code traces everything else, quieses everything, identifies the threads that need to do work for suspending, and advances those. Likewise, hotplug cpus would probably be a lot simpler if the hotplug code could just take over the entire system and single-step anything in an unsuitable state until it's all consistent.<br>

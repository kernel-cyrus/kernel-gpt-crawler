The "virtual dynamic shared object" (or vDSO) is a small shared library
exported by the kernel to accelerate the execution of certain system calls
that do not necessarily have to run in kernel space.  While the kernel
developers have settled on a small set of functions to export via the vDSO,
there is nothing preventing developers from adding their own.  If there is
some information an application needs to obtain frequently and quickly from
the kernel, a vDSO function might be useful solution.
See <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html">the vDSO(7) man
page</a> for an introduction to the vDSO.
<p>
This article shows how the programming technique used to implement
these functions is based mainly on clever additions to the Linux
linker script and how the same technique can be applied to
implement functions that quickly compute values based
on sets of kernel variables.
It can be seen as a sort of complement to <a href="/Articles/604287/">this
series</a> on regular system calls.
Depending on the hardware platform, different sets of functions
are included in the vDSO library. The implementation described
here refers to the <tt>x86_64</tt> architecture.

<p>


<h4> Virtual system calls </h4>

<p>   When a process invokes a system call, it
executes a special instruction forcing the CPU to switch to
kernel mode, saves the contents of the registers on the kernel mode
stack, and starts the execution of a kernel function. When the
system call has been serviced, the kernel restores the contents of
the registers saved on the kernel mode stack and executes another
special instruction to resume execution of the user-space process.

</p><p>

Putting system calls that access kernel-space information into the process
address space would make them 
faster because they would be able to fetch the required value from
the kernel address space without those context switches.
Clearly, only "read-only" system calls are valid candidates for
this type of emulation because user-space processes are not allowed to write
into the kernel address space. User-space functions that emulate
system calls are called <em>virtual system calls</em>.

</p><p>

The Linux vDSO implementation on <tt>x86_64</tt>  offers four of these
virtual system calls: <tt>__vdso_clock_gettime()</tt>,
<tt>__vdso_gettimeofday()</tt>, <tt>__vdso_time()</tt>, and
<tt>__vdso_getcpu()</tt>. They correspond, respectively, to the  standard
<tt>clock_gettime()</tt>, <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>,
<tt>time()</tt>, and <tt>getcpu()</tt> system calls.

</p><p>

How much faster is a virtual system call than a standard
one? This clearly depends on the hardware platform and on the
processor type. On a P6T SE ASUS motherboard with an
Intel 2.8GHz Core i7 CPU, the average time required to execute a
standard <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> system call is 90.5 microseconds,
the average time for the corresponding virtual system call is 22.3
microseconds, a significant improvement which justifies the effort
spent in developing the vDSO framework.
<p>

<h4> What is the vDSO?</h4>
<p>
When thinking about the vDSO, you should keep in mind that this term has
two different meanings: (1)&nbsp;it is a dynamic
library, but the term is also used to refer to (2)&nbsp;a memory region
belonging to the address space 
of every user-mode process. The vDSO memory region — like most
other process memory regions —  has its location randomized
by default every time it is mapped. Address-space layout
randomization is a form of defense against security holes.

</p><p>

If you display, by means of the "<tt>cat /proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</tt>" command,
the memory regions owned by the process having a process ID equal to
<tt><i>pid</i></tt>, you'll get a line like:
<p>
<pre>
    7ffffb892000-7ffffb893000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0          [vdso]
</pre>
<p>
which describes the attributes of this special region. The vDSO
beginning address, <code>0x7ffffb892000</code>,
is smaller than <tt>PAGE_OFFSET</tt> (which is <tt>0xffff880000000000</tt>
on x86-64 machines), thus, the
vDSO is part of the user-space address space. The final address,
namely <tt>0x7ffffb893000</tt>, shows that the vDSO occupies a single
4KB page. The <tt>r-xp</tt> permission flags
specify that read and execute permissions are enabled and that the
region is private (not shared). The last three fields indicate that
the region is not mapped from any file and, thus, that it has no inode.

</p><p>

The binary code stored in the vDSO memory region has the format of
a dynamic library.  If you dump the code from the vDSO memory region
into a file and apply the <tt>file</tt> command to it, you'll get: 
<p>
<pre>
    ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped 
</pre>
<p>
All Linux shared dynamic libraries, such as <tt>glibc</tt>, use the ELF format.

</p><p>

If you disassemble the file containing a vDSO memory
region, you'll find the assembly code of the four virtual system
calls mentioned previously. On a 3.15 kernel, only 2733
bytes out of 4096 are needed to store the ELF header and the code of the virtual
system calls in the vDSO. This means that there is still room
for additional functions.

</p><p>

Since the vDSO is a fully formed ELF image, you can do symbol
lookups on it. This allows new symbols to be added with newer
kernel releases and allows the C library to detect available
functionality at run time when running under different kernel
versions. If you run "<tt>readelf&nbsp;-s</tt>" on a file
containing a vDSO memory region, you'll get a display of the
entries in the symbol table section of the file:
<p>
<pre>
Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 11 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
     1: ffffffffff700330     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    7 
     2: ffffffffff700600   727 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 clock_gettime@@LINUX_2.6

     6: ffffffffff7008e0   365 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 gettimeofday@@LINUX_2.6
     7: ffffffffff700a50    22 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 time@@LINUX_2.6
     8: ffffffffff700a70    61 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 getcpu@@LINUX_2.6
     9: ffffffffff700600   727 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 __vdso_clock_gettime@@LINUX_2.6
    10: ffffffffff700a50    22 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 __vdso_time@@LINUX_2.6
</pre>
<p>
Here you can see the various functions found within the vDSO region.
<p>
<h4>Where is the data? </h4>
<p>
No mention has been made until now of how virtual system calls
retrieve variables from the kernel address space. This is perhaps
the most interesting and least documented feature of the vDSO
subsystem.

Consider, for the sake of concreteness, the <tt>__vdso_gettimeofday()</tt>
virtual system call. This function fetches the kernel data it needs from a
variable called <tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>. This variable has <em>two</em>
different addresses:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is a regular kernel-space address whose value is greater
than <tt>PAGE_OFFSET</tt>. If you look at the
<tt>System.map</tt> file, you'll find that this symbol has an address like 
<tt>ffffffff81c76080</tt>.

<p>

<li>The second address is in a region called the "<tt>vvar</tt> page". The base
address (<tt>VVAR_ADDRESS</tt>) of this page is  defined in the kernel to
be at <tt>0xffffffffff5ff000</tt>, close to the end of the 64-bit
address space.  This page is made available read-only to user-space code.
</ul>
<p>
 Clearly, both addresses map to the 
same physical address; i.e. they refer to the same page frame.
<p>
Variables are created in this page with the <tt>DECLARE_VVAR()</tt> macro.
For example, the declaration of <tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>
puts it at an offset of 128 within the
<tt>vvar</tt> page. The user-space-visible address of this variable is thus:
<tt>0xffffffffff5ff000&nbsp;+&nbsp;128</tt>. In order to allow the linker
to detect the 
variables exist in the <tt>vvar</tt> page, the
<tt>DECLARE_VVAR()</tt> macro puts them in the <tt>.vvar</tt> special
section in the kernel binary image
(see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/531148/">Special sections in Linux
binaries</a> for more information).

</p><p>

Code running within the kernel uses the kernel-space address to access
<tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>. Virtual system calls, which run in user mode,
must use the second address. The variables located in the vDSO
page are accessed by user-mode processes using the <tt>__USER_DS</tt>
segment descriptor. They can be read but they cannot be written. As a
further precaution, Linux declares them as <tt>const</tt> so that the
compiler will detect any attempt to write into them.

<!-- 
<p>
The <tt>vvar</tt> page is not mapped in the process
address spaces. The functions in the <tt>vdso</tt> page read the <tt>vvar</tt>
page while the kernel updates it. If you disassemble one of the functions
contained in <tt>linux/arch/x86/vdso/gettimeofday_timing.o</tt>, say
<tt>__vdso_time</tt>, you'll notice that it accesses the <tt>vvar</tt> page
located at <tt>0xffffffffff5ff000</tt>.
-->
</p><p>


The values of the <tt>vvar</tt> variables are set from 
the values of other kernel variables not accessible to user-space
code. When the kernel modifies the value of one of its internal variables, the
associated variable(s) in the <tt>vvar</tt> page must be
updated. In Linux, this task is performed by the
<tt>timekeeping_update()</tt> function which is invoked, for
instance, whenever <tt>jiffies</tt>, the number of elapsed ticks
since the system was started, is modified.

<p>

<h4> Adding a function to the vDSO page </h4>
<p>
The Linux vDSO implementation  makes it easy for kernel developers to add
new functions into the vDSO page. If you look at the code of the four
virtual system calls, you'll notice that three of them fetch the kernel
data they need from a <tt>vvar</tt> variable called <tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>
of type <tt>struct vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>. The fourth one, that is,
<tt>__vdso_getcpu()</tt>, does not fetch anything: it gets the CPU index by
executing a <tt>rdtscp</tt> instruction.

</p><p>

Another important observation is that the parameter passed to
<tt>timekeeping_update()</tt>, the function which updates the fields of
<tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>, is a pointer to a global kernel variable called
<tt>timekeeper</tt> of type <tt>struct timekeeper</tt>. When a kernel function
updates a field of <tt>timekeeper</tt> related to a virtual system call, it
can assume that in a short while this change will affect
<tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt> and thus the values returned by the virtual system
calls. In other words, kernel functions that update fields of
<tt>timekeeper</tt> are loosely coupled with virtual system calls.

</p><p>

The simplest way to define a new vDSO function is to create a similar
coupling between the internal kernel variables of interest and a variable
added to the <tt>vvar</tt> page.  The <tt>update_vsyscall()</tt> function,
which you can expect to be called with relatively high frequency, can be
augmented to move the data into the <tt>vvar</tt> page as needed.
</p><p>

Here are some hints that may help you in
developing new vDSO functions:
<p>
<ul>

<li> When coding a vDSO function, remember that no external kernel
function or global kernel variable can appear in the code, only automatic
variables (stack) and <tt>vvar</tt> variables. Since the function runs in user
mode, kernel-space identifiers are unknown to the linker. 

</p><p>

<li> The Linux linker script that handles vDSO functions must be told that
     a new function, say <tt>__vdso_foo()</tt>, is being added. To that
     end, you must add a couple of lines like the following to
     <tt>linux/arch/x86/vdso/vdso.lds.S</tt>:

<p>
<pre>
    foo;
    __vdso_foo;
</pre>
<p>
You must also add the following lines at the end of the definition of
<tt>__vdso_foo()</tt> in the 
<tt>linux/arch/x86/vdso/</tt> directory:
<p>
<pre>
    int foo(struct fd *fd) __attribute__((weak, alias("__vdso_foo")));
</pre>
<p>
In this way, <tt>foo()</tt> becomes a weak alias for <tt>__vdso_foo()</tt>.

</p><p>


<li> Don't forget to modify the code of <tt>update_vsyscall()</tt>, a simple
transfer function invoked by <tt>timekeeping_update()</tt>, which copies some
fields of <tt>timekeeper</tt> into the <tt>vsyscall_gtod_data</tt>
variable.  This function can also copy your data of interest into your new
variable in the <tt>vvar</tt> page.

</p><p>

<li> If the prototype of the new function is: <tt>int __vdso_foo(struct fd
*fd)</tt>, the test program, say <tt>test_foo.c</tt>, which invokes
<tt>__vdso_foo()</tt> must be linked as:
<p>
<pre>
    gcc -o test_foo linux/arch/x86/vdso/vdso.so test_foo.c
</pre>
<p>
because the code of <tt>__vdso_foo()</tt> is included in the <tt>vdso.so</tt>
library. Having defined <tt>foo</tt> as a weak alias for <tt>__vdso_foo</tt>,
you may also invoke <tt>foo()</tt> instead of <tt>__vdso_foo()</tt> in the test
program.

</ul>

<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
The programming technique used to implement vDSO functions is based on
some clever additions to the Linux linker script that allow kernel functions
defined in the Linux kernel to be linked in the address space of all user-mode
processes. 
New vDSO functions can be easily implemented to get
information about the current kernel state (number of processes in the system,
number of free pages, etc.).  If you have information that you must get out
of the kernel with high frequency and low overhead, the vDSO mechanism
might just provide the tool you need.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Unfortunately, this is a bit dated -- the x86 vvar mechanism was heavily reworked in 3.16.  Vvars (with the hopefully short-lived exception of the kvm-clock stuff) live in another vma next to the vvar page.<br>

I would be interested if anyone knows more here and can explain to me.  Is the idea that timing becomes more precise because there is less system call time to take into account when querying it?  Or is it important for some applications to call gettimeofday() in tight loops with no reasonable alternatives?<br>
<p>
I realise that that sounds slightly sceptical, but I am quite willing to believe that there are important reasons for it.<br>

(Note: this one got fixed, but guess how many other seldom-used or closed-source applications there are.)

Rsyslog used to get many timestamps per message (when it was read, when it was added to the main queue, when it was pulled from the main queue, when it was added to an action queue, when it was pulled from an action queue, when it was delivered)<br>
<p>
Eliminating all these and going to a single gettimeofday() call made a very significant difference in the number of messages that ryslog could handle. As other optimizations have been added to speed things up, it's been discovered that even a single gettimeofday() call per message is a noticable overhead, so rsyslog now has the option of only doing the call every N messages (assuming that there are more than N messages in the kernel waiting for rsyslog to read them, if there are fewer, a call is made after each time the kernel queue is drained)<br>
<p>
So yes, there are real-world cases where systems do a lot of gettimeofday() calls and it's not always clear that it's wrong to do them.<br>

Another example is the PostgreSQL EXPLAIN command, which is used to work out which part of a query is taking the most time. This can call gettimeofday() thousands, maybe tens of thousands of times per second or more. It adds some overhead, but on some non-Linux platforms the overhead can exceed the cost of the actual query.<br>
<p>
There have been attempts to try and reduce the overhead with sampling techniques, but the error was just too high to be useful. So it's just accepted, while improvements to the gettimeofday() are eagerly welcomed.<br>

It's certainly useful for profiling if you can add a gettimeofday() to a tight loop to see how long each iteration takes. It's also helpful if you can leave it there to investigate future performance problems without causing undue load.<br>

      Some info worth adding here...
<p>
vDSO implementations of the APIs for sampling high resolution timestamps (gettimeofday and clock_gettime w/CLOCK_REALTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC) depend on user space access to a high resolution counter (e.g. TSC).  This is used to calculate the time elapsed since the last time the kernel updated the data page, and mirrors what the kernel does internally to service system calls.
<p>
You wouldn't want to have a situation where

<pre>
syscall(SYS_gettimeofday, ...); /* serviced by kernel */
gettimeofday(...);              /* serviced by vDSO */
</pre>
<p>
returns timestamps that aren't monotonically increasing (leaving aside system time adjustments).

I was just going to ask that.  jiffies is obviously not high resolution enough for gettimeofday.   can multiple cpus still cause issues with rdtsc?  or is the monotonic guarantee single cpu only?<br>

I think some older CPUs have issues with TSC sync, which the kernel detects and works around by using a different clocksource like HPET (and the vDSO on x86 has different routines for different clocksources).<br>

Microseconds for gettimeofday is way off. Nanoseconds is correct timescale.<br>
<p>
Specifically on my box I recall seeing that gettimeofday takes around 6 nanoseconds. Which looks quite plausible given its just readtsc plus a bit of math.<br>

That was bugging me too.<br>
<p>
Some programs have a legitimate need to get timestamps millions of times per second. Think of UDP traffic doing flow control in user space.  In TCP, the kernel fills in the timestamps all by itself. Cheating, I would say.<br>
<p>
  A sendmsg that fills in a designated timestamp field somewhere in the payload would be very helpful for some applications. Likewise, a similarly equipped recvmsg, although that would be a little trickier to set up. The useful timestamp reference point would be when the packet came off the wire.<br>

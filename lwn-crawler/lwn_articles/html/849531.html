A number of different attacks against Linux systems rely on brute-force
techniques using the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><tt>fork()</tt></a>
system call, so 
a new Linux security module (LSM), called "Brute", has been created to
detect and thwart such attacks.
Repeated <tt>fork()</tt> calls can be used for various types of
attacks, such as exploiting the <a
href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2017/06/19/the-stack-clash">Stack
Clash</a> vulnerability or <a
href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a>-style flaws.
Version&nbsp;6 of the Brute patch set was recently
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210307113031.11671-1-john.wood@gmx.com/">posted</a>
and looks like it might be heading toward the mainline.
</p>

<p>
This patch set has been in the works since it was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200906121544.4204-1-john.wood%40gmx.com/">first
posted as an RFC</a> by John Wood in September&nbsp;2020 (the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200910202107.3799376-1-keescook%40chromium.org/">resend
from Kees Cook</a> a few days later may make it easier to see the whole
set).  It was originally called "fork brute force attack mitigation" or
"fbfam", but that name was deemed too cryptic <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez1V=oVczCCSuRaWX=bbN2cOi0Y9q48=e-Fuhg7mwMOi0A@mail.gmail.com/">by
Jann
Horn</a> and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202009101615.8566BA3967@keescook/">Cook</a>.  In
addition, it was suggested that turning it into an LSM would be desirable.
Both of those suggestions were
adopted in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201025134540.3770-1-john.wood%40gmx.com/">version&nbsp;2</a>,
which was posted in October. 
</p>

<p>
But the idea goes back a lot further than that.  The <a
href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity">grsecurity</a> kernel patches have long had
the <a
href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options#Deter_exploit_bruteforcing"><tt>GRKERNSEC_BRUTE</tt>
feature</a> to mitigate brute-force exploits of server programs that use
<tt>fork()</tt> as well as exploits of  setuid/setgid binaries.  A <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/1419457167-15042-1-git-send-email-richard@nod.at/">patch</a>
from Richard Weinberger in 2014 used a similar technique to delay
<tt>fork()</tt> calls if forked children die due to a fatal error (which
may imply it is part of an attack).  That effort was not pushed further, so
Cook added an <a href="https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/39">issue</a>
to the <a
href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project">kernel
self-protection project</a> (KSPP) <a 
href="https://github.com/KSPP">GitHub repository</a>, which is
where Wood picked up the idea.
</p>

<p>
In the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210307113031.11671-8-john.wood@gmx.com/">documentation
patch</a>, Wood described the kinds of behaviors that are being targeted by
the Brute LSM.  The basic idea is that there are several types of attacks
that can use <tt>fork()</tt> multiple times in order to receive a desired
memory layout; each child forked can be probed in various ways, if those
probes fail and cause the child to crash, another child can simply be
forked to try again.  Because the child created with <tt>fork()</tt> shares
the same memory layout as the parent, successful probes can give
information that can be used to defeat <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">address-space
layout randomization</a> (ASLR),  determine the value of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries">stack
canaries</a>, or for other nefarious purposes.
</p>

<p>
Brute takes a different approach than either grsecurity or Weinberger's patch did, in
that it does not simply delay subsequent <tt>fork()</tt> calls when a
problem is detected.  Instead, Brute kills all of the processes associated
with the attack.  In addition, Brute detects more types of
<tt>fork()</tt>-using attacks, including those that probe the parent,
rather than the child process.  It also focuses on crashes in processes
that have crossed a privilege boundary to try to reduce
the number of false positives.
</p>

<p>
It does its detection by focusing on the rate of crashes, rather than just their
occurrence.  Brute collects information on the number of "faults" that
occur in a group of processes that have been forked, but where nothing new has
been executed with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"><tt>execve()</tt></a>.
A <tt>brute_stats</tt> structure is shared between all of 
those processes; executing a new program results in a new structure to
track faults in the new (potential) <tt>fork()</tt> hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
The period of time between a process being started and it or any of its
children that share its memory layout (i.e. no <tt>execve()</tt>) have
crashed, or between consecutive crashes, is ultimately what is being used
to determine if an attack is 
taking place.  But in order to not be too sensitive, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average">exponential
moving average</a> (EMA) of the period is calculated once five crashes have
occurred.  The EMA is used to
determine if a "fast brute force" attack variant is occurring; if the EMA
of the
period between crashes drops below a threshold of 30 seconds, attack mitigation is
triggered.  For "slow brute force" variants, the absolute number of crashes
in the hierarchy
is compared against a threshold of 200.  Some way to
configure these values would seem like a desirable addition to Brute.
</p>

<p>
The crashes are detected using the <tt>task_fatal_signal()</tt> LSM hook
that was <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210307113031.11671-2-john.wood@gmx.com/">added</a>
as the first patch in the set.  It will be called whenever the kernel is
delivering a fatal signal to a process.  Brute also uses the existing
<tt>task_alloc()</tt> hook to detect <tt>fork()</tt> calls,
the <tt>bprm_committing_creds()</tt> hook to detect <tt>execve()</tt> calls,
and the <tt>task_free()</tt> hook to clean everything up.
</p>

<p>
The security boundary checks are implemented by tracking changes to the
various user and group IDs (real, effective, saved, and filesystem) that
occur when executing new programs.  There is no mention of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">Linux
capabilities</a> in the patches, but capability changes would also
indicate that a privilege boundary is being crossed; perhaps that is
something that will be added down the road.   Beyond the ID changes, the use of networking
is detected using the <tt>socket_sock_rcv_skb()</tt> LSM hook.  The idea is
to restrict the crash checking to those processes that are crossing
privilege boundaries by either doing things like executing setuid/setgid programs or receiving data
over the network.  That is intended to reduce the number of false positives.
</p>

<p>
As can be seen in the changelog in the top-level patch, the last few
versions (which are helpfully linked) have drawn minimal comments needing
attention; this latest round has not drawn any at all at the time of this
writing.  It seems like a useful feature for some users without imparting
any real burden on the rest of the kernel when it is not configured in;
the new security hook that gets called in the case of a fatal signal being
delivered is the only change in that case.  LSMs are often looked upon as a
place to put code that some folks want, but others don't want to pay a
price for in their kernels—Brute seems to fit that model well.

I wish using LSM as a common frame supported an option to disable all of such modules with a single stroke.<br>

Security is undoubtedly a necessity, and security modules are certainly useful for many users.  However, I fear the moment when I&#x27;ll have to spend hours to understand why something doesn&#x27;t work until finally resolving to add &quot;brute=0&quot; right after &quot;apparmor=0&quot; on GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.<br>

I haven&#x27;t followed closely, but <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/808048/">https://lwn.net/Articles/808048/</a> seems a lot more promising to me because it allows lifting all these heuristics out of the kernel - a hybrid eBPF + userspace process can access more semantic information; say things like &quot;did this process receive packets from an untrusted network recently&quot;.  And it can be much more configurable, e.g. one could easily recode it to force a process like this to dump core for offline analysis instead, etc.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  For &quot;slow brute force&quot; variants, the absolute number of crashes in the hierarchy is compared against a threshold of 200. Some way to configure these values would seem like a desirable addition to Brute. </font><br>
I can&#x27;t wait for a bug report with a description: &quot;Finally, a thing that has killed systemd for good!&quot; because systemd had to restart a lot of failing daemons in short order.<br>

      Wouldn't they die after <tt>exec</tt>, thus not sharing memory layout and not triggering this mitigation?

Not necessarily, if exec() fails for some reason. E.g. a binfmt handler was accidentally removed and foreign binaries can no longer run (happened to me a while ago when I was testing a cross-image).<br>

So? The failing child will then log the problem and exit. It will not die with a segfault or similar, thus it won&#x27;t trigger Brute.<br>

Why does it kill the process hierarchy rather than just causing fork to fail?<br>

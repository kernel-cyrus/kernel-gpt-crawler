           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 17, 2015</br>
           </div>
The leap second is an occasional ritual wherein Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) is held back for one second to account for the slowing of the Earth's
rotation.  The last leap second happened on June&nbsp;30, 2012; the next is
scheduled for June&nbsp;30 of this year.  Leap seconds are thus infrequent
events.  One might easily imagine that infrequent events involving time
discontinuities would be likely to expose software problems, and, sure
enough, the 2012 leap second <a
href="/Articles/504744/">had
its share of issues</a>.  The 2015 leap second looks to be a calmer affair,
but it appears that it will not be entirely problem-free.
<p>
Prarit Bhargava <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/27/458">reported</a>
a problem at the end of May: it seems that, when the leap second hits, some
timers can fire one second earlier than they should.  This is not a good outcome;
timers can be delayed, but they should never fire before their appointed
time.  It did not take long to understand the problem, but finding a proper
solution was a rather slower task.
<p>
Linux handles leap seconds in the kernel.  An application (typically the
network time protocol (NTP) daemon) informs the kernel of an upcoming leap
second via the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/adjtimex.2.html"><tt>adjtimex()</tt>
system call</a>; when the appointed time arrives, the system clock will be
set back by one second.  There is an important detail in all of this, though:
this adjustment happens during the normal timer tick.  The tick is not
precisely lined up with the second boundaries as determined by UTC, so
there is a window of time between the 
beginning of the leap second and when the kernel figures out that it needs
to hold the clock back.  The window is brief (a maximum of about 10ms,
usually shorter), but that's enough time for timers set for just after
midnight to fire.
<p>
One might argue that one second every few years is not a big problem, and
that applications that really care should be using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">International
Atomic Time</a> (TAI) clock anyway.  There <i>are</i> applications with
precise timekeeping requirements; some of them are certainly using the UTC
clock rather than TAI, but they should work anyway if possible.  So this
seems like a problem worth fixing.
<p>
John Stultz's <a href="/Articles/648319/">first attempt</a> at providing
that fix did not go entirely well, though.  In particular, the <a
href="/Articles/648320/">patch</a> that moved the leap-second adjustments
into the timer fast-path code ran into opposition.  The patch added some
significant complexity to code that is already far from simple, and it
threatened to slow down some of the most frequently exercised code in the
kernel.  The <a href="/Articles/648324/">loudest opposition</a> came from
Ingo Molnar, who asked: "<q>why do we add over 100 lines of 
code for something that occurs (literally) once in a blue moon?</q>"
<p>
Ingo's suggestion was to implement <a
href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html">leap-second
smearing</a> instead.  The smearing approach does away with the time
discontinuity by tweaking the speed of the clock instead; it would handle a
leap second insertion by running the clock just a little slower for a
number of hours prior to the event.  There are no abrupt time transitions,
and no weird times (like 23:59:60) that applications may not be prepared to
deal with.  It could, Ingo <a href="/Articles/648325/">said</a>, also be
handled almost entirely from user space via <tt>adjtimex()</tt>, allowing
administrators to control policy and getting the kernel out of the
leap-second business entirely.
<p>
In truth, life is not so simple.  Clocks that do not have leap seconds (the
TAI clock in particular) should not smear, so the kernel would have to stay
involved and it would have to maintain time bases running at different
speeds while the smearing was happening.  As John <a
href="/Articles/648327/">noted</a>, that does not look like a path leading
to lower levels of complexity.  He argued that, while smearing looks like a
worthwhile thing to add to the kernel, it does not address the immediate
problem.
<p>
Ingo also <a href="/Articles/648328/">argued</a> that the leap-second code
should not support leap-second deletion, where the clock is set
<i>ahead</i> by one second.  Deletion has never happened, and, when one
looks at the physical processes involved in the slowing of the Earth's
rotation, it seems like it probably never will ("<q>discounting massive
asteroid strikes, at which point leap seconds will be the least of our
problems</q>").  Other operating systems are unlikely to handle deletion
gracefully; if they support it at all, it is with code that has never been
exercised in the real world.  The <tt>adjtimex()</tt> interface allows for
it, though, so John argues that it should be supported; the code is already
there and seems unlikely to be removed.
<p>
After the discussion calmed down, John came back with <a
href="/Articles/648329/">a reduced patch set</a> limited to the essential
fix.  In this version of the patch, the timer code does the leap-second
adjustment early enough to avoid premature timer expirations; one might
suggest that the new timer code looks before it leaps.  The rest
of the code remains untouched, though, so the performance impact of the
change is minimal.  This version found a friendlier reception;
it has been added to the "tip" tree for merging into the 4.2 kernel.
<p>
As of this writing, the leap-second insertion is less than two weeks away,
so John's fix is clearly not destined to be deployed worldwide before that
happens.  But 
getting it into the mainline now will ensure that it's running on at least
some development systems when the leap second hits, giving it a certain
amount of real-world testing.  That should increase confidence in the
correctness of the patch and help to ensure that, when the next leap second
is declared, the kernel will handle it properly.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The kernel does not run its internal hardware clock in local time, for good reasons including the summer/winter time discontinuities.<br>
<p>
Why doesn't the kernel's internal hardware clock just run in TAI? The UTC leap seconds create much the same problems as using a local time zone. TAI seems the obvious best solution, with conversions to UTC or localtime where needed using a table of old leap seconds, in much the same way as UTC is converted to localtime before it is shown to the user.<br>
<p>
I guess the answer is backwards compatibility with the Unix UTC tradition. But I still though it should be mentioned what the obvious correct solution is in a perfect world.<br>

Internal timers should normally use "monotonic" time with ktime_get(), ktime_get_ts64(), or ktime_get_seconds(), or possibly the jiffies variable.<br>
The problematic interface is the getnstimeofday() function (and the older do_gettimeofday()) that is meant for compatibility with user space interfaces that rely on UTC, so we can't easily change that.<br>

There should be an interface offering userspace TAI time. And userspace should use TAI time internally, only convert to UTC when displaying to the user (just like localtime).<br>

The rarely test 61th second case would just make the userspace code unnecessarily complex.<br>

That makes sense for new code.  But what about existing code which assumes 60 seconds in a minute but relies on querying system time?<br>

Do we need to define a new standard "UTC with no leap seconds" which simply makes one second double the normal length when a leap second occurs?<br>

POSIX time is UTC with seconds repeated when a leap second occurs.  With or without the abolition of leap seconds, I imagine that fixed 86400 second per day encoding will never change.<br>
<p>
The kernel should probably adopt TAI for its primary clock, and keep a UTC offset and pending UTC offset change to supply kernel and user space clients with POSIX time.  <br>
<p>
All timer expirations specified using POSIX time should be converted to TAI once, and the double (or never) expiration problem will go away.<br>
<p>
Of course you would want some way for user space to query the current TAI time and specify timers using TAI.  There also has to be some way for user space to load the current UTC offset, and any pending UTC offset change.<br>
<p>
Systems with a non-TAI real time clock should probably default to interpreting the UTC or local time stored there as some derivative of UTC with no further leap seconds.<br>

In-kernel timers are all done using 'jiffies' or 'ktime_t', which are monotonic and never based on UTC. Using TAI for those would only make them suffer from problems with concurrent 'clock_settime' calls.<br>
<p>
On the systme call level, almost all timeouts are given as relative times, the only exception being mq_timedsend/mq_timedreceive that indeed take a UTC timespec absolute argument instead of a relative number of seconds to wait for. If a leap second happens before the mq_timedsend timeout, the timeout may occur a second late, or the call may accidentally succeed instead of timing out. Neither of these problems seems serious enough to justify changing an established API though.<br>

In MirBSD, it does. This has a number of problems:<br>
<p>
• it breaks historic precedence; this was not a problem for a niche system with at best a few hundred users (and at the current time maybe a dozen or two)<br>
<p>
• all user space must be prepared to handle leap seconds in 'time_t'; conversion from and to 'struct tm' is affected<br>
<p>
• 'struct tm'.tm_sec will contain 60 occasionally instead of just 00‥59<br>
<p>
• it violates POSIX explicitly (but is required by German law, so you can’t follow both…)<br>
<p>
• the kernel has to know about all leap seconds, i.e. have the table compiled in (possibly updated by an LKM or the bootloader)<br>
<p>
The big problem here is compatibility – changing the time_t representation is an ABI breakage (although switching between 'posix' and 'right' timezones helps a bit), and not all applications are prepared for it, and libc must know about it.<br>
<p>
It *does* make things right, though.<br>

The difference is mainly in that time_t is “the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC”, which may or may not (but, in the common sense, ought to) include leap seconds (it’s TAI if it does), while “struct tm” is calendaric time (which is always UTC, on both systems, or even localtime). You only need to convert between the time_t variants.<br>

Asides from compatibility, POSIX compliance and the problem that any application that needs to convert between a broken-down calendar date (struct tm ↔ time_t conversion, which includes the kernel and hwclock when they read/write the RTC) must have an up-to-date leap second table are probably the hindering factors.<br>

The 9.1-magnitude 2004 Sumatran earthquake shortened the day by 6.8 microseconds. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041229/full/news041229-6.html">http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041229/full/news041229-6....</a> The 8.8-magnitude 2010 Chilean Earthquake shortened the day by 1.6 microseconds. Id. If there's ever going to be a subtraction soon, I'd bet it would be caused by a series of severe earthquakes, not an asteroid.<br>
<p>
A glaciation event could also shorten the day. In the long term that's probably an inevitability. Although that far in the future the notion of trying to maintain a global clock reference for computational tasks would probably seem quaint. We're nearing the point where the precision of clocks exceeds the local drift caused by gravitational time dilation. At some point people will have to get their *hit together and actually think about what they're trying to do with time measurements, and what clock and unit is most relevant to their particular task. This is why I think dropping leap seconds from UTC is misguided. It's a quick fix that will become irrelevant in a couple of decades, if not years. And we'll be back to square one, with people trying to redefine the problem rather than fixing their solutions.<br>

      At a few microseconds for a massive earthquake, we'd need quite a few of them to add up to an appreciable shortening of the day.  I suspect that might, once again, put us into "we'll have bigger problems" territory.

I wonder what effect 20m global sea rise might have?  That is the gloomy prediction in this weeks New Scientist.  Mind you that doesn't happen for a few thousand years but it is a continuous process.  From memory, (it's in the shredder already) 5m by 2100.  I think it would slow rotation slightly (mental image of spinning skater extending arms, conservation of err stuff etc.)  That leads to a longer day.<br>
<p>
Global warming leads to more leap seconds.  We clearly need the patch and more sun screen. <br>
<p>
Now, future asteroid mining could lead to a full leap minute insertion unless a suitable chunk of Earth is sent elsewhere, so make sure to account for all possible cases.<br>

Total mass of the planet will be conserved, and the 20m height difference is pretty tiny vs the diameter of the earth.  So while angular momentum must be conserved, the actual velocity shift at the equator might mean that instead of one leap second every 4.0 years we might have one leap second every 3.9999 years.<br>
<p>
It would be an interesting exercise in mathematics to come up with the proper answer, but I suspect my out-of-my-nether-reigons of a 0.01% slowdown overstates the effect by several orders of magnitude.<br>

Not only would conservation of angular momentum immediately lengthen the day due to water moving from near the poles to the oceans as a whole, but over a longer (millennial) timespan it would lengthen the day further, because the land the ice was on will slowly rise due to isostatic rebound, getting further from the earth's rotational axis in the process.<br>

On the other hand, if/when the Antarctic ice melts, Antarctica will rise (no effect on rotational speed since it's at the pole) which means that something else will drop (since the Earth's volume doesn't change), which shortens the day. Same for the melting of glaciers; the ice, formerly a few km up, will now be at sea level.<br>

</blockquote>
Often the earth's volume can change -- density changes are routine (e.g. as things cool, grow denser, and shrink). In this case, the density will drop a bit because there is less stuff on top of it. Not by much, though, and indeed we will see a net movement of mass towards the pole due to this effect (stuff flowing in to replace some of the space Antarctica used to take up -- though whether that comes from further down or from out away from the pole is an open question, as far as I know: it's quite hard to study mass flows in the mantle under Antarctica!!)

Just smear the leap second. For most companies its only important to be coherent internally and the drift from leap second smearing is rather small anyway.<br>
As the dedicated NTP boxes started to support leap second smearing we had hardly any leap second this time.<br>
Maybe ntp pool should start to offer leap second smearing timeservers too.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 17, 2014</br>
           </div>
As can be seen in the <a href="/Kernel/Patches">LWN kernel patch
tracker</a> (or in the patches section of the weekly Kernel Page), there
have been a lot of significant patch sets posted over the course of the
last week or so.  The pace of kernel development continues to increase, so
there is always a lot of new code out there in need of review.  There's
just one little potential problem: as of this writing, the 3.19 merge
window is open, and many subsystem maintainers are busy getting the current
set of changes into the mainline and dealing with any resulting fallout.
They are unlikely to have much spare time for patch review.
<p>
Merge-window patch postings are not uncommon; most maintainers either just
defer looking at them or ignore them altogether.  This time around, though,
Thomas Gleixner <a href="/Articles/626545/">vented his frustration</a> on
the linux-kernel list:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
     	Nothing of this is 3.19 material so posting it right now is just
	useless. I'm not going to look at it and I'm not going to look at
	it next week either.  This whole featuritis driven 'post crap as
	fast as you can' thing has to stop, really.
</div>
<p>
Posting patches during the merge window, he said, constitutes "maintainer
abuse."
<p>
Some developers agreed with these sentiments, and Kevin Cernekee promptly
posted  (during the merge window, of course) <a href="/Articles/626546/">a
patch series titled "Stop maintainer 
abuse"</a> trying to codify a rule that patches should not be
posted during merge windows.  Patches meant for the next merge window
should, by these rules, be posted prior to the preceding -rc5 release;
patches posted after -rc5 comes out will end up coming out one release
later.  And no patches at all, other than urgent fixes, should be posted
while the merge window is open.
<p>
There is a potential problem, though, in that not all subsystem maintainers
work the same way.  Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/Articles/626547/">disagreed</a> with the rules, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Merge window isn't really special, and patches can easily be
	reviewed and queued up for the next merge window in that time.  If
	it said you shouldn't expect replies and not _resend_ during the
	merge window that seems like a much saner policy.
</div>
<p>
Linus <a href="/Articles/626548/">responded to the posting guidelines</a>
by noting that they don't apply equally to all maintainers:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	[F]or fairly simple subsystems in particular, some maintainers
	basically have their pull requests for the merge window open
	*before* the merge window even starts, and for them, the merge
	window itself isn't actually all that busy, it's often the week
	before that is the busy one.  So the exact timing can vary by
	maintainership, and while I think the above is a reasonable
	example, it should perhaps be documented as such.
</div>
<p>
Alan Cox <a href="/Articles/626549/">worried</a> that trying to put a lid
on patch postings is always doomed to failure:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Every time anyone has tried to deal with Linux scaling problems by
	throttling the rate it has failed, from the near forking of it when
	Linus couldn't cope onwards. Today we are already seeing the same
	occurring with all the vendor trees, and shared downstream trees
	with a rapidly growing amount of stuff that simply isn't upstream
	because upstream can't keep up with actual product timescales any
	more.
</div>
<p>
His suggestion was to, instead, try to streamline the process a bit, mostly
by improving the <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/">patchwork</a>
system to automate (or at least assist) many common maintainer duties.  He
finished by proposing that:  "<q>It could then be integrated into git
(if only so we can have a 'git lost' command to block annoying
sources).</q>"
<p>
In the end, it is hard to see this problem being solved by either more
rules or better tools.  The creation of kernel patches continues at an
increasing pace; the kernel community has to keep up with the flow somehow
or suffer in the long run.  In many cases, what may really be needed is
more maintainers; some subsystems are now maintained by groups, but most of
them are still managed by a single developer.  Spreading the load would
allow some maintainers to work on merge window issues while others keep
track of the patch flow.
<p>
Such a change would require maintainers to allow others into their often
fiercely guarded domains, though; the groups would also have to put time
into developing a workflow that would work for them.  It is not a simple or
immediate solution, and it still will not address ills like developers who
repost lengthy patch sets multiple times in one day.  So, it seems,
maintainers will still just have to get grumpy occasionally when developers
push the boundaries too hard.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm guessing that Thomas Gleixner doesn't receive many patches from drive-by committers, or by people "who can write kernel code" as opposed to "kernel developers".<br>
<p>
I personally don't know when merge windows are, and my patches are sent when they're ready, and the maintainers I've had to deal with are nice enough to have queued those patches in branches until the merge window.<br>

      <p>I think you're probably fine.

<p>Thomas Gleixner calls out three large patch series in his complaint.  I'd guess they're regular developers hoping to get something into a particular kernel version at the last minute, as opposed to "drive-by"s just landing in the merge window by accident.

One of the series' cover letters [1] clearly states:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; For 3.19 you'll want the first patch at the minimum (because the build is currently broken).</font><br>
<p>
I think that's sufficient reason for resending, and it certainly doesn't qualify as "featuritis driven 'post crap as fast as you can'".<br>

If it's worth doing it, it's worth doing it BIG.- Let's think of a system able to cope with one billion developers, or so. Then we can throw it away (as any typical second system) and do it right.<br>

My proposal is to charge a dollar for applied patch. <br>

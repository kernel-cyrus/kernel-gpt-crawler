           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 23, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel's memory allocator must work within a large set of constraints
if it is to perform well under most workloads.  Over time, these
constraints have led to the addition of significant complexity to the
low-level allocation code.  But problems remain, and, as it turns out,
sometimes the best solution is to get rid of some of that complexity and
take a simpler approach.  <a href="/Articles/657967/">This patch set</a>
from Mel Gorman has been making the rounds for some time and appears to be
reaching a mature stage; it's worth a look as an example of what it takes
to perform well in current kernels.
<p>
The allocator in question here is the low-level page allocator (or "buddy
allocator").  The smallest unit of memory it deals with is a full page
(4096 bytes on most systems).  The slab allocators (including
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>) are built on top of the page allocator; they have their
own complexities that we'll not be concerned with here.
<p>
The page allocator is the ultimate source of memory in the system; if that
allocator can't fulfill a request, the memory simply cannot be had.  So
considerable effort is put into ensuring that memory is available at all
times, especially for high-priority callers that cannot wait for some
memory to be reclaimed from elsewhere.  High-order allocations (those
requiring more than one page of physically contiguous memory) complicate
the problem; memory tends to fragment over time, making contiguous chunks
hard to find.  Balancing memory use across NUMA systems adds yet another
twist.  All of these constraints (and more) must be managed without slowing
down the system in the allocator itself.  Solving this problem involves a
significant amount of complex code, scary heuristics, and more; it is not
surprising that memory-management changes can be hard to merge into the
mainline.
<p>
<h4>The zone cache</h4>
<p>
The page allocator divides physical memory into "zones," each of which
corresponds to memory with specific characteristics.  <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>
contains memory at the bottom of the address range for use by severely
challenged devices, for example, while <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt> may contain most
memory on the system.  32-bit systems have a <tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt> for
memory that is not directly mapped into the kernel's address space.  Each
NUMA node has its own set of zones as well.  Depending on the
characteristics of any given allocation request, the page allocator will
search the available zones in a specific priority order.  For the curious,
<tt>/proc/zoneinfo</tt> gives a lot of information about the zones in use
on any given system.
<p>
Checking a zone to see whether it has the memory to satisfy a given request
can be more work than one might expect.  Except for the highest-priority
requests, a given zone shouldn't be drawn below specific low
"watermarks," and comparing a zone's available memory against a watermark
can require a significant calculation.  If the "zone reclaim" feature is
enabled, checking a nearly-empty zone can cause the memory-management
subsystem to try to reclaim memory in that zone.  For these reasons and
more, the "zonelist cache" was <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/9276b1bc96a132f4068fdee00983c532f43d3a26">added</a>
to the 2.6.20 kernel in 2006.  This cache simply tries to remember which
zones have been found to be full in the recent past, allowing allocation
requests to avoid checking full zones.
<p>
The case for the zonelist cache has been weakening for some time, and Mel's
patch set weakens it further by making the watermark checks cheaper.  Zone
reclaim has been fingered as a performance problem for a number of
workloads (including <a href="/Articles/591723/">PostgreSQL server
workloads</a>) and is now disabled by default.  But the biggest problem
seems to be that, if a zone is unable to satisfy a high-order allocation,
it will be marked as "full" even if single pages abound there.  Subsequent
single-page allocations will then avoid the zone, even though that zone is
entirely capable of satisfying those allocations.  That can
cause allocations to be needlessly performed on remote NUMA nodes,
worsening performance.
<p>
Mel notes that this problem "<q>could be addressed with additional
complexity but as the benefit of zlc [the zonelist cache] is questionable,
it is better to 
remove it</q>".  This part of the patch series removes nearly 300 lines
of complex memory-management code and improves some benchmarks in the
process.  The fact that zones are always checked has some other effects;
the most notable is apparently that more direct reclaim work
(attempts to reclaim memory by the process performing an allocation)
results from checking zones that would have previously been skipped.
<p>
<h4>The atomic high-order reserve</h4>
<p>
Within a zone, memory is grouped into "page blocks," each of which
can be marked with a "migration type" describing how the block should be
allocated.  In current kernels, one of those types is
<tt>MIGRATE_RESERVE</tt>; it marks memory 
that simply will not be allocated at all unless the alternative is to fail
an allocation request entirely.  Since a physically contiguous range of
blocks is so marked, the effect of this policy is to maintain a minimum
number of high-order pages in the system.  That, in turn, means that
high-order requests (within reason) can be satisfied even when memory is
generally fragmented.
<p>
Mel <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/56fd56b868f19385c50af8941a4c78df433b2d32">added
the migration reserve</a> during the 2.6.24 development cycle in 2007.  The
reserve improved the situation at the time but, in the end, it relied on
an accidental property of the minimum watermark implemented in the page
allocator many years before.  The reserve does not actively keep high-order
pages around; it simply steers requests away from a specific range of
memory unless there is no alternative, in the hope that said range will
remain contiguous.  The reserve also predates the current memory-management
code, which does a far better job of avoiding fragmentation and performing
compaction when fragmentation does occur.  Mel's current patch set
implements the conclusion that this reserve has done its time and removes
it.
<p>
There is still value in reserving blocks of memory for high-order
allocations, though; fragmentation is still a concern in current kernels.
So another part of Mel's patch set creates a new
<tt>MIGRATE_HIGHATOMIC</tt> reserve that serves this purpose, but in a
different way.  Initially, this reserve contains no page blocks at all.  If
a high-order allocation cannot be satisfied without breaking up a
previously whole page block, that block will be marked as being part of the
high-order atomic reserve; thereafter, only higher-order allocations (and
only high-priority ones at that) can be
satisfied from that page block.
<p>
The kernel will limit the size of this reserve to about 1% of memory, so it
cannot grow overly large.  Page blocks remain in this reserve until memory
pressure reaches a point where a single-page allocation is about to fail;
at this point, the kernel will take a page block out of the reserve to be
able to satisfy that request.  The end result is a high-order page reserve
that is more flexible, growing or shrinking in response to the demands of
the current workload.  Since the demand for high-order pages can vary
significantly from one system (and one workload) to the next, it makes
sense to tune the reserve to what is actually running; the result should be
more flexible allocations and higher-reliability access to high-order
pages.
<p>Lest kernel developers think that they can be more relaxed about high-order
allocations in the future, though, Mel notes that, as a result of the
limited size of the reserve, "<q>callers that speculatively abuse atomic
allocations for long-lived high-order allocations to access the reserve
will quickly fail</q>".  He gives no indication of just who he thinks
those callers are, though.  There is one other potential pitfall with this
reserve that bears keeping in mind: since the first page block
doesn't enter the reserve until a high-order allocation is made, the
reserve may remain empty until the system has been running for a long
time.  By that point, memory may be so fragmented that the reserve can no
longer be populated.  Should such situations arise in real-world use, they
could be addressed by proactively putting a minimum amount of memory into
the reserve at boot time.
<p>
The high-order reserve also makes it possible to remove the separate
watermarks for high-order pages.  These watermarks try to ensure that
each zone has a minimal number of pages available at each order; the
allocator will fail allocations that drive the level below the relevant watermark
for all but the highest-priority allocations.  These watermarks are
relatively expensive to implement and can cause normal-priority allocations
to fail even though suitable pages are available.  With the patch set
applied, the code continues to enforce the single-page watermark, but, for
higher-order allocations, it merely checks that a suitable page is available,
counting on the high-order reserve to ensure that pages will be kept
available for high-priority allocations.
<p>
<h4>Flag day</h4>
<p>
Memory-allocation requests in the kernel are always qualified by a set of
"GFP flags" ("GFP" initially came from "get free page") describing what
can and cannot be done to satisfy the request.  The most commonly used
flags are <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> and <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt>, though they are
actually built up from lower-level flags.  <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> is the
highest-priority request; it can dip into reserves and is not allowed to
sleep.  Underneath the hood, <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> is defined as the single
bit <tt>__GFP_HIGH</tt>, marking a high-priority request.
<tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> cannot use the reserves but can sleep; it is the
combination of <tt>__GFP_WAIT</tt> (can sleep), <tt>__GFP_IO</tt> (can
start low-level I/O), and <tt>__GFP_FS</tt> (can invoke filesystem
operations).  The full set of flags is huge; they can be found in <a
href="/Articles/658108/"><tt>include/linux/gfp.h</tt></a>.
<p>
Interestingly, the highest-priority requests are not marked with
<tt>__GFP_HIGH</tt>; instead, they are marked by the <i>absence</i> of
<tt>__GFP_WAIT</tt>.  Requests with <tt>__GFP_HIGH</tt> can push memory
below the watermarks, but only non-<tt>__GFP_WAIT</tt> requests can access
the atomic reserves.  This mechanism doesn't work as well as it could in
current kernels, where many subsystems may make allocations they don't want
to wait for (often because there is a fallback mechanism available if the
allocation fails), but those subsystems do not need access to the deepest
reserves.  But, by leaving off <tt>__GFP_WAIT</tt>, such code will access
those reserves anyway.
<p>
This problem, along with a general desire to have more explicit control
over how memory-allocation requests are satisfied, has led Mel to rework
the set of GFP flags somewhat.  To do so, he has added some new flags to
the (already long) list:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>__GFP_ATOMIC</tt> identifies requests that truly come from atomic
     context, where no sort of blocking or delay is acceptable and there is
     no fallback in case of failure.  If an allocation is being made with
     <tt>__GFP_ATOMIC</tt>, it may mean, for example, that spinlocks are
     currently held.  These requests are the ones that get access to the
     atomic reserves.
<p>
<li> <tt>__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM</tt> indicates that the caller is willing to
     go into direct reclaim.  Doing so implies that the request can block
     if need be.  This flag does not imply <tt>__GFP_FS</tt> or
     <tt>__GFP_IO</tt>; they must be specified separately if they are
     applicable (though in such cases it probably makes sense to just use
     <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt>).
<p>
<li> <tt>__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM</tt> says that the <tt>kswapd</tt> kernel
     thread can be woken up to perform reclaim.  Poking <tt>kswapd</tt>
     does not imply blocking, but it may start activity in the system that
     can affect performance in general.  As an example, consider a driver
     that would very much like to allocate a high-order chunk of memory,
     but it can get by with a bunch of single pages if that chunk is not
     available.  The high-order allocation may be best tried without
     <tt>__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM</tt>, since things will still work fine if
     that allocation fails and
     there is no real need to start aggressively reclaiming memory.
</ul>
<p>
With this set of flags, code can express the difference between being
absolutely unable to sleep and not wanting to sleep.  The "must succeed"
nature of a request has been separated from the "don't sleep" aspect,
eliminating situations where allocations dip unnecessarily into the atomic
reserves.  For users of the basic <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> and
<tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> flag sets little will change, but Mel's patch set makes
changes to several dozen call sites that deal with GFP flags at a lower
level.
<p>
As a whole, this patch set touches 101 files and removes a net 240 lines of
code.  With luck, a number of core memory-management algorithms have been
simplified while improving performance and making the system more
reliable.  Mel's strongly benchmark-focused approach will help to build
confidence in this work, but it's still a set of significant changes to a
complex kernel subsystem, so it's not surprising that the patches have
had to go through a number of revisions and extensive review.  It seems
likely that this process is coming to an end, and that this work will find
its way into the mainline in the next development cycle or two.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

For a year now, I've had a problem with memory if I had used a lot of it (say &gt;4GB out of 8GB) with VirtualBox:<br>
<p>
- With swap disabled: When (according to System Monitor) I have used about 60% of my memory (the rest used as cache), apparently OOM killer is invoked, which makes the system go to a crawl for a few seconds and complete unresponsiveness afterwards.  After Alt+SysRq+s-then-u, it comes back alive and I can see the OOM logs.<br>
- With swap enabled: All goes well, but when I shut the system down, there is a huge amount of wait (minutes) before something related to swap happens and the computer shuts down.  I have come to use Alt+SysRq+s-then-u-then-o to turn off since then whenever I use VirtualBox.<br>
<p>
Now that I have vented, I really hope the problem goes away with this patch-set!<br>

I must be misunderstanding something because it sounds as if the patch waits till the system is about to run out of memory before it creates a reserve. It also sounds like it would create a bottleneck for future systems with more cores.<br>
It's a shame Intel doesn't have a memory translation system like a ssd drive so the OS can pretend it has contiguous blocks of memory. <br>

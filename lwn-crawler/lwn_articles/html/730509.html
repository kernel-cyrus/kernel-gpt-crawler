<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 10, 2017</br>
           </div>
The kernel's development community is large, to the point that it is often
far from obvious who a given patch should be sent to.  As the community has
grown, it has developed mechanisms for tracking that information centered
on a text file called <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>.  But now it would appear that
this scalability mechanism has scalability problems of its own.
<p>
The <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.12.5/source/MAINTAINERS"><tt>MAINTAINERS</tt></a>
file sits at the top of the kernel's source tree;
it is a plain-text file with a number of fields describing how various
kernel subsystems are managed.  For example, the following entry was
consulted for <a href="/Articles/730217/">a recent article</a> on
device-tree issues:
<p>
<pre>
    OPEN FIRMWARE AND FLATTENED DEVICE TREE
    M:	Rob Herring &lt;robh+dt@———&gt;
    M:	Frank Rowand &lt;frowand.list@———&gt;
    L:	devicetree@vger.kernel.org
    W:	http://www.devicetree.org/
    T:	git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/robh/linux.git
    S:	Maintained
    F:	drivers/of/
    F:	include/linux/of*.h
    F:	scripts/dtc/
    F:	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-ofw
</pre>
<p>
This entry says that the flattened device-tree subsystem has two
maintainers (the "<tt>M:</tt>" fields), Rob Herring and Frank Rowand.  The
relevant mailing list (<tt>L:</tt>) and web site (<tt>W:</tt>) are given,
as is the subsystem's Git tree (<tt>T:</tt>).  The <tt>F:</tt> lines
describe the files and directories that are considered to be a part of this
subsystem.  The file can be read in a text editor, but it is often
consulted by way of the <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> script, which reads a
patch and outputs a list of addresses to which the patch should be sent.
<p>
This file is over 14,000 lines long in current kernels and contains entries
for over 1,700 subsystems in the kernel.  Those subsystems are ostensibly
listed in alphabetical order but, as Randy Dunlap noted in <a
href="/Articles/730511/">a patch</a> posted in July, many of the entries
are not in the right place.  His patch sought to improve the situation, but
that is where the real trouble started.
<p>
In a community as large as the kernel, changes to subsystems happen on a
frequent basis.  If the relevant maintainers are paying attention, those
changes result in patches to the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file — on the order
of 100 patches in each development cycle.  Needless to say, a certain
number of those patches will conflict with each other, and Linus Torvalds
gets to clean up the mess.  When Dunlap's patch inevitably resulted in a
merge conflict, Torvalds <a href="/Articles/730512/">proclaimed</a> his
frustration with the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file.  Perhaps, he asked, there
would be some way to split it up?
<p>
His original suggestion was to spread the maintainer information through
the kernel source tree, 
like the kernel configuration file was split up starting in 1.3.36.  He
later <a href="/Articles/730513/">suggested</a> that the maintainer
information could, in fact, live in the <tt>Kconfig</tt> files with the
configuration options, though that idea did not get far.  Regardless of the
exact scheme used, he <a href="/Articles/730514/">explained</a>, splitting
up the maintainer information would make resolving conflicts into a less
frustrating task.
<p>
The advantages of a less frustrated Linus Torvalds are evident to most
kernel developers, so interest in improving the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file
is relatively high.  Joe Perches <a href="/Articles/730515/">suggested</a>
splitting the file into a top-level <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> directory; that
would keep the information easy to find and easy for scripts to work with.
And that would indeed appear to be way things are headed.
<p>
That leaves the question of how the file should be split.
Yet another suggestion from Torvalds was to <a
href="/Articles/730519/">split the file by mailing list</a>, so that all
entries pointing to the same list would end up in the same file.  But
Perches came back with <a href="/Articles/730520/">a script</a> that splits
the file by directory hierarchy instead.  The result is 54 files in the
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> directory with names like <tt>arch_arm64</tt>,
<tt>drivers_gpu_drm</tt>, or <tt>filesystems</tt>.  Any subsystem without
enough entries to justify its own file ends up in
<tt>MAINTAINERS/MAINTAINERS</tt>.
<p>
Torvalds <a href="/Articles/730521/">tried it out</a> but chose not to go
with the result.  He had a few quibbles with how the split is done, but
concluded that "<q>*some* of it looks really nice</q>".  But perhaps
the concern that really stopped things was a familiar one: making this
change will create merge conflicts with any subsystem tree containing
changes to the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file.  The most likely solution to that
problem is to make the change immediately after the 4.14-rc1 release.
Torvalds has not committed to doing so, but it does seem likely that the
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> split is coming in the relatively near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Perhaps this is the "repeal and replace" version of the MAINTAINERS "repeal" patch which was <a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/718986/>proposed</a> in April.

The F lines look like Git pathspecs. Is there any reason not to use gitattributes for this purpose? For consolidation, it's possible to define your own attributes in git:<br>
<p>
[attr]maint-x86 mailinglist=blah website=…<br>
<p>
Then instead of a Perl script, you query the attributes for all the files in a branch. It also makes it possible to find files which are missing some metadata about maintainership.<br>
<p>
It'd be nice to describe values for a custom attribute, but that is probably a reasonable extension to the existing functionality.<br>

Dogfooding requires that the MAINTAINERS data be in a DeviceTree document. MAINTAINERS are hardware configuration that forms part of the initial configuration of this kernel you're building, will install and boot, right? :-P<br>
<p>
We can move to YAML (or json, or markdown, or SGML or *...) later on when there are enough people interested in this bikeshed.<br>

ACPI? Come on, the mainframe is where true Enterprise is happening.<br>
<p>
Obviously, you need to do STORE MAINTAINER until you get cc 3 [1] and examine the stored PMCB [2] to find out what you need.<br>

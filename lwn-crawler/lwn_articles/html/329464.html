<h1>The slow work mechanism</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 22, 2009</br>
           </div>
Many years ago, your editor heard Van Jacobson state that naming an
algorithm "slow start" was one of the biggest mistakes he had ever made.
The name refers to the technique of ramping up transmit rates slowly until
the carrying capacity of the connection is determined.  But others just saw
"slow" and complained that they didn't want their connections to be slow.
The fact that "slow start" made the net faster was lost on them.  One might
wonder if David Howells's "slow work" mechanism - merged for 2.6.30 - could
run into similar problems; no kernel developer wants things to run slowly.
But, as with slow start, running things slowly is not the point.
<p>

Slow work is a thread pool implementation - yet another thread pool, one
might say.  The kernel already has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/211279/">workqueues</a> and the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/314808/">asynchronous function call</a>
infrastructure; the distributed storage (DST) module added to the -staging
tree for 2.6.30 also 
has a thread pool hidden within it.  Each of these pools is aimed at a
different set of uses.  Workqueues provide per-CPU threads dedicated to
specific subsystems, while asynchronous function calls are optimized for
specific ordering of tasks.  Slow work, instead, looks like a true "batch
job" facility which can be used by kernel subsystems to run tasks which are
expected to take a fair amount of time in their execution.
<p>

A kernel subsystem which wants to run slow work jobs must first declare its
intention to the slow work code:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/slow-work.h&gt;

    int slow_work_register_user(void);
</pre>
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
The call to slow_work_register_user() ensures that the thread pool is set
up and ready for work - no threads are created before the first user is
registered.  The return value will be either zero (on success) or the usual
negative error code.
<p>
Actual slow work jobs require the creation of two structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct slow_work;

    struct slow_work_ops {
	int (*get_ref)(struct slow_work *work);
	void (*put_ref)(struct slow_work *work);
	void (*execute)(struct slow_work *work);
    };
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>slow_work</tt> structure is created by the caller, but is otherwise
opaque.  The <tt>slow_work_ops</tt> structure, created separately, is where
the real work gets done.  The <tt>execute()</tt> function will be called by
the slow work code to get the actual job done.  But first,
<tt>get_ref()</tt> will be called to obtain a reference to the
<tt>slow_work</tt> structure.  Once the work is done, <tt>put_ref()</tt>
will be called to return that reference.  Slow work items can hang around
for some time after they have been submitted, so reference counting is
needed to ensure that they are freed at the right time.  The
implementation of <tt>get_ref()</tt> and <tt>put_ref()</tt> functions is
not optional.
<p>
In practice, kernel code using slow work will create its own structure
which contains the <tt>slow_work</tt> structure and some sort of
reference-counting primitive.  The <tt>slow_work</tt> structure must be
initialized with one of:
<p>
<pre>
    void slow_work_init(struct slow_work *work, const struct slow_work_ops *ops);
    void vslow_work_init(struct slow_work *work, const struct slow_work_ops *ops);
</pre>
<p>
The difference between the two is that <tt>vslow_work_init()</tt>
identifies the job as "very slow work" which can be expected to run (or
sleep) for a significant period of time.  The documentation suggests that
writing to a file might be "slow work," while "very slow work" might be a
sequence of file lookup, creation, and <tt>mkdir()</tt> operations.  The
slow work code actually prioritizes "very slow work" items over the merely
slow ones, but only up to the point where they use 50% (by default) of the
available threads.  Once the maximum number of very slow jobs is running,
only "slow work" tasks will be executed.
<p>
Actually getting a slow work task running is done with:
<p>
<pre>
    int slow_work_enqueue(struct slow_work *work);
</pre>
<p>
This function queues the task for running.  It will succeed unless the
associated <tt>get_ref()</tt> function fails, in which case
<tt>-EAGAIN</tt> will be returned.
<p>
Slow work tasks can be enqueued multiple times, but no count is kept, so a
task enqueued several times before it begins to execute will only run
once.  A task which is enqueued while it is running is indeed put
back on the queue for a second execution later on.
The same task is guaranteed to not run on multiple CPUs
simultaneously.
<p>
There is no way to remove tasks which have been queued for execution, and
there is no way (built into the slow work mechanism) to wait for those
tasks to complete.  A "wait for completion" functionality can certainly be
created by the caller if need be.  The general assumption, though, seems to
be that slow work items can be outstanding for an indefinite period of
time.  As long as tasks with a non-zero reference count exist, any
resources they depend on need to remain available.
<p>
There are three parameters for controlling slow work which appear under
<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/slow-work</tt>: <tt>min-threads</tt> (the minimum size
of the thread pool), <tt>max-threads</tt> (the maximum size), and
<tt>vslow-percentage</tt> (the maximum percentage of the available threads
which can be used for "very slow" tasks).  The defaults allow for between
two and four threads, 50% of which can run "very slow" tasks.
<p>
The only user of slow work in the 2.6.30 kernel is the FS-Cache file
caching subsystem.  There is a clear need for thread pool functionality,
though, so it would not be surprising to see other users show up in future
releases.  What might be more surprising (though desirable) would be a
consolidation of thread pool implementations in a future development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<P>
I doubt that.  If he were writing a title for a ballot proposition, I'd believe the name would have that effect, but I don't think the engineers who evaluated slow start were that simple-minded.  I think they objected to slow start for what it was, since it does in fact slow down certain applications.
<p>
Maybe Jacobson meant that the name caused busy engineers to focus on that aspect of the algorithm and not notice more important effects.

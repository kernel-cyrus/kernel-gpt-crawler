The <tt>nopage()</tt> address space operation is charged with handling a
major page fault within an address range.  For address spaces backed by
files, there is a generic <tt>nopage()</tt> method which causes the needed
page to be read into memory.  Device drivers also occasionally provide
<tt>nopage()</tt> as part of their implementation of <tt>mmap()</tt>.  In
the driver case, a page fault is usually handled by finding the <tt>struct
page</tt> corresponding to a memory-mapped buffer and passing that back to
the kernel.
<p>
There are a couple of errors which can be signaled by <tt>nopage()</tt>:
<tt>NOPAGE_SIGBUS</tt> for truly bad addresses and 
<tt>NOPAGE_OOM</tt> for situations where an out-of-memory situation caused
the attempt to handle the fault to fail.  What is missing is the ability to
indicate that <tt>nopage()</tt> was interrupted by a signal and the
operation should be retried.  That is not a situation which normally comes
up in <tt>nopage()</tt> handlers which, if they must wait, usually do so in
a non-interruptible manner.  Benjamin Herrenschmidt has run into this
issue, however, and has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/199642/">proposed</a> a small change allowing
a new <tt>NOPAGE_RETRY</tt> value.  The response would be just as one would
expect - the operation is retried later on, after the signal is handled.
<p>
It turns out that Google <a href="/Articles/200215/">has a similar
patch</a> which it applies internally, though the motivations are
different.  In Google's case, the patch exists to work around a performance
problem that has been experienced there.  This patch has not been submitted
for merging because of <a href="/Articles/200216/">potential denial of
service problems</a> and the fact that its author considers it to be a bit
of a hack.
<p>
Some form of this patch may well be merged eventually, but some more work
seems called for first.  The two patches make it clear that there are
multiple reasons for returning <tt>NOPAGE_RETRY</tt>, so it might make
sense to make that reason available to the higher levels of the page fault
handler.  That would allow some potential efficiency problems to be
addressed, though the DOS scenario still presents potential problems.
<p>

Meanwhile, one of the longstanding limitations of <tt>nopage()</tt> is that
it can only handle situations where the relevant physical memory has a
corresponding <tt>struct page</tt>.  Those structures exist for main
memory, but they do not exist when the memory is, for example, on a
peripheral device and mapped into a PCI I/O memory region.  Some
architectures also do very strange things with special memory and multiple
views of the same memory.  In such cases, drivers must explicitly map the
memory into user space with <tt>remap_pfn_range()</tt> instead of using
<tt>nopage()</tt>.

<p>
Jes Sorensen has, for some time, been carrying <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/200156/">a patch</a> which adds another
address space operation called <tt>nopfn()</tt>.  It is called in response
to page faults only if there is no <tt>nopage()</tt> operation available;
its job is to return a physical address (in the form of a page frame
number) for the page which will satisfy the fault.  That address will be
stored directly into the process's page table, with no <tt>struct page</tt>
required, and no reference counting performed.  Jes has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/200199/">an IA-64 special memory driver</a>
which shows how this operation would be used.
<p>

The idea has not been universally popular in the past - <a
href="http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/linux-ia64/0603/17557.html">Linus
has opposed it</a>, as have others.  To some it looks like a needless
complication of the virtual memory subsystem; these people would rather see
code use <tt>remap_pfn_range()</tt> or create special <tt>page</tt>
structures as needed.  There are a number of situations where the
<tt>nopfn()</tt> is said to work better, however, and the pressures for its
inclusion do not appear to be going away.  So it will be interesting to see
whether this one makes it into 2.6.19 or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

For as long as operating systems have had kernels, there has been a need to
extract information from data structures stored within those kernels.  Over
the years, a wide range of approaches have been taken to make that
information available.  In current times, it has become natural to reach
for BPF as the tool of choice for a variety of problems, and getting
information from kernel data structures is no exception.  There are two
patches in circulation that take rather different approaches to using BPF
to dump information from kernel data structures to user space.
<p>
When your editor first encountered paleolithic Unix systems, tools like
<tt>ps</tt> would obtain their information by opening <tt>/dev/kmem</tt>
and rooting around directly in the kernel's memory space.  This approach
had the advantage of requiring no direct kernel support, but there were
also some disadvantages, including security issues, lack of atomicity in
the collection of complex data, and occasionally returning random garbage.
This behavior was perhaps acceptable in the early days, but contemporary
users have become strangely less tolerant of it.  So digging around in
kernel memory has long since fallen out of favor.
<p>
In current Linux systems, this problem is solved with a collection of
system calls and virtual files in <tt>/proc</tt>, sysfs, debugfs, and
beyond.  This approach works, but has some challenges of its own.  The
kernel must be modified whenever the information to be output changes,
"debugging" information in debugfs ends up being needed for normal system
operations (where debugfs should not be enabled), and changes can be hard
to make without breaking existing 
applications.  So there is a natural desire for something more flexible and
adaptable.
<p>
<h4>Structure dumpers</h4>
<p>
One approach, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20200415192740.4082659-1-yhs@fb.com/">posted</a> by
Yonghong Song, is aimed directly at the virtual-file case.  In short, it
allows the attachment of BPF programs to implement <tt>/proc</tt>-style
files for any supported data structure.
<p>
More specifically, it creates a new virtual filesystem that is expected to
be mounted at <tt>/sys/kernel/bpfdump</tt>.  It is a singleton filesystem,
in that it will provide the same contents regardless of how many times (or
in how many different namespaces) it is mounted.  Kernel subsystems can
then create subdirectories in that filesystem to make specific data
structures available.  For example, in the patch series, the
<tt>task</tt> subdirectory is created to export the active
<tt>task_struct</tt> structures from the kernel, <tt>bpf_map</tt> will
allow traversal through the list of BPF maps, and <tt>netlink</tt> provides
information on active netlink connections.
<p>
Then the patch series adds a new type of BPF program called
<tt>BPF_TRACE_DUMP</tt>.  A
program of this type will be called with a pointer to a structure, and is
expected to generate the output for user space, which is written using the
<a href="/Articles/22355/">seq_file interface</a>.  To that end, two new
helper functions — <tt>bpf_seq_printf()</tt> and <tt>bpf_seq_write()</tt> —
have been added.  These programs are loaded into the kernel with the <a
href="http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt>
system call</a> in the usual manner.
<p>
Finally, the meaning of the <tt>BPF_OBJ_PIN</tt> command, which was
originally added to support programs and maps that persist after the file
descriptors referring to them are closed, is extended.  With this command,
a <tt>BPF_TRACE_DUMP</tt> program can be "pinned" to a file created inside
a <tt>/sys/kernel/bpfdump</tt> directory.  So, for example, if one wanted
to create a new process dumper called "<tt>myps</tt>", one could load a BPF
program to generate the desired output from the task structure, then "pin"
it to a file named <tt>myps</tt> under <tt>/sys/kernel/bpfdump/task</tt>.
<p>
The patch set includes a few sample programs to demonstrate the mechanism
and for self testing; as an example, one can be pinned under
<tt>/sys/kernel/bpfdump/netlink</tt> that generates output identical to
that from <tt>/proc/net/netlink</tt>.  Of course,
replicating existing interfaces is not particularly interesting, but it
does show how new interfaces can be created.  With this capability, users
can create interfaces that provide exactly the information they need in a
relatively efficient manner.  If new information is needed, it can be had
without changing the kernel.
<p>
That said, there is some setup required; each structure type that is to be
made available in this way requires a certain amount of support code to
iterate through active structures and pass them to the relevant BPF
program.  But that is a one-time effort for each type; after that, in
theory, kernel developers need never worry about exporting information from
that structure type to user space again.  At least, as long as nobody
worries that some of the data that is being made available should, instead,
be kept secret within the kernel.
<p>
<h4><tt>printk()</tt></h4>
<p>
The other approach, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1587120160-3030-1-git-send-email-alan.maguire@oracle.com/">posted</a>
by Alan Maguire, is oriented more toward debugging needs.  When addressing
that particular use case, it's only natural to fall back on
<tt>printk()</tt> 
to get information out to user space.
<p>
When debugging a problem, one commonly needs to look at various fields
within a kernel data structure.  Rebuilding the kernel with a
<tt>printk()</tt> call in the right place is usually sufficient to learn
something about the issue; often what is learned is that not enough fields were
printed and the process needs to start over again.  A nice feature to have
would be the ability to simply print an arbitrary structure in its
entirety; that is often easy to do in interpreted languages like Python,
but it is not normally available in&nbsp;C.
<p>
The ability to print specific structure types has existed in the kernel for
some time; for example, an <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.6.7/source/include/uapi/linux/rtc.h#L21"><tt>rtc_time</tt>
structure</a> can be printed directly using the <tt>%ptR</tt> format
directive.  A
relatively small number of structures <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/printk-formats.html#struct-va-format">is
supported</a>, though;
each new one requires adding more code to <tt>printk()</tt> and that
support must be updated whenever the structure is modified.  So this
feature is far from a capability to print an arbitrary structure.
<p>
What Maguire realized is that, with the addition of BPF type format (BTF)
data to the kernel, it is possible to do something better.  BTF was
originally added to solve <a href="/Articles/773198/">the problem of BPF
program binary portability</a> between systems.  The layout of any given
data structure can vary from one kernel configuration to the next, making
it hard to create BPF programs that can run universally across all
configurations.  BTF describes the types used in the kernel as it was
actually built; user-space tools can then use that information to
"relocate" references within structures to the correct offsets prior to
loading a BPF program into the kernel.
<p>
But, once you have a description of a structure's layout available within
the kernel, you can use it to print out that structure's data.  So Maguire
added a new format directive to do so.  The format is
"<tt>%pT&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;</tt>", where <tt><i>type</i></tt> is the type
of the structure pointer being passed.  Making it
"<tt>%pT<b>N</b>&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;</tt>" adds the field names as well.  An
example in the patch set prints 
an <tt>sk_buff</tt> structure (used in the networking layer to hold a
packet) with a line like:
<p>
<pre>
    pr_info("%pTN&lt;struct sk_buff&gt;", skb);
</pre>
<p>
The resulting output looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    {{{.next=00000000c7916e9c,.prev=00000000c7916e9c,
      {.dev=00000000c7916e9c|.dev_scratch=0}}|
      .rbnode={.__rb_parent_color=0,.rb_right=00000000c7916e9c,.rb_left=00000000c7916e9c}|
      .list={.next=00000000c7916e9c,.prev=00000000c7916e9c}},
      {.sk=00000000c7916e9c|.ip_defrag_offset=0},{.tstamp=0|.skb_mstamp_ns=0},
      .cb=['\0'],{{._skb_refdst=0,.destructor=00000000c7916e9c}|
      .tcp_tsorted_anchor={.next=00000000c7916e9c,.prev=00000000c7916e9c}},
      ._nfct=0,.len=0,.data_len=0,.mac_len=0,.hdr_len=0,.queue_mapping=0,
      .__cloned_offset=[],.cloned=0x0,.nohdr=0x0,.fclone=0x0,.peeked=0x0,
      .head_frag=0x0,.pfmemalloc=0x0,.active_extensions=0,.headers_start=[],
      .__pkt_type_offset=[],.pkt_type=0x0,.ignore_df=0x0,.nf_trace=0x0,
      .ip_summed=0x0,.ooo_okay=0x0,.l4_hash=0x0,.sw_hash=0x0,.wifi_acked_valid=0x0,
      .wifi_acked=0x0,.no_fcs=0x0,.encapsulation=0x0,.encap_hdr_csum=0x0,
      .csum_valid=0x0,.__pkt_vlan_present_offset=[],.vlan_present=0x0,
      .csum_complete_sw=0x0,.csum_level=0x0,.csum_not_inet=0x0,.dst_pending_co
</pre>
<p>
Here, the original "all on one line" format has been broken up a bit for
readability.  Output is limited to 1024 characters, which explains the
rather abrupt ending seen above.  In cases where that limit proves to be
a problem, omitting the "<tt>N</tt>" qualifier will allow more fields to be
output but without names.  Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200417164747.GD17973@kernel.org/">suggested</a>
that an additional "<tt>z</tt>" option could suppress the printing of
fields whose value is zero, making the output much more compact; that
suggestion seems likely to be implemented in the next version of the patch
series.
<p>
While <tt>printk()</tt> is the immediate application for this feature,
Maguire suggested that it could be used in other settings as well.  Ftrace could
use it to print out structure contents at tracepoints, for example, or the
kernel could use it to enhance the information available in oops listings.
<p>
These patch sets show two different approaches to using the kernel's BPF
infrastructure to format information in kernel data structures for use
outside of the kernel.  They address sufficiently different use cases that
it is not a question of which of the two might be accepted; there would
appear to be room for both.  Each makes it easier to look inside the kernel
in its own way.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Looking at the example output, omitting leading zeros for non-zero values would also help with compactness.</p>

<p>I am slightly curious also - there are a bunch of hex values without a leading '0x', but also quite a lot of values with a leading '0x'. Notably, there are a few '=0' and '=0x0'. I wonder why some are one way, and some another?</p>

Looking at the field names, it looks to me like the full length ones are pointers, and the others are, well, not pointers.  Or possibly empty pointers(?).<br>
<p>
That’s an interesting choice, but seems sensible I guess.  It might be really nice to have a version that optionally printed type info - basically type size and whatever else.  For the cases where you’re not quite sure what got compiled in to your running kernel.<br>

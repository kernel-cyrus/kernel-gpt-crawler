           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 7, 2010</br>
           </div>
Every kernel development cycle seems to involve one set of patches which
turn out to be more trouble than had been expected.  With 2.6.34, that
award should probably go to the patches found under the somewhat confusing
<tt>CONFIG_NO_BOOTMEM</tt> option. 
<p>
"Bootmem" is a simple, low-level memory allocator used by the kernel during
the early parts of the bootstrap process.  One might think that the kernel
does not need yet another allocator, but the memory management code used
during operation requires that much of the kernel already be functional
before it can be called.  Getting to that point involves a chain of
increasingly complicated memory allocation mechanisms; on the x86
architecture, those begin the "early_res" mechanism which takes over from
the BIOS "e820" facility.  Once things get a little farther, the
architecture-independent bootmem allocator takes over, followed,
eventually, by the full buddy allocator.
<p>
Yinghai Lu came to the conclusion that things could be simplified
considerably if the bootmem stage were taken out of the picture.  The
result was a series of patches which extends the use of the early_res
mechanism for long enough to bootstrap the buddy allocator.  These changes
were merged for 2.6.34, but the old bootmem-based code was left behind.
The <tt>CONFIG_NO_BOOTMEM</tt> option controls which allocator is used,
with the default being to short out bootmem.
<p>
This is a significant change to the crucial and tricky early bootstrap
code, so few people were surprised when some regressions were reported
against 2.6.34-rc1.  When the reports continued to arrive after -rc3,
though, the level of irritation began to grow, to the point that Linus <a
href="/Articles/382564/">started talking about</a> reverting the whole
thing.  Nobody seemed to dislike the objectives of the patches, but
system-killer regressions after -rc3, along with the twisted mess of
<tt>#ifdef</tt>s created by the patch and the fact that it was on by
default led to some grumpiness.
<p>
Normally, new features are expected to be configured out by default; to the
greatest extent possible, a new kernel should behave as much like its
predecessors as possible when the default options are taken.  In this case,
the default led to significant changes and problems.  The purpose of this
option <a href="/Articles/382566/">was twofold</a>: to allow the new code
to be configured out when it proved to be problematic, and to ensure that
it was well tested in the mean time.  Certainly it was successful on both
fronts, even if some of the testers proved to be not entirely willing.
<p>
As of this writing, it would appear that the worst problems have been
fixed; talk of removing the no-bootmem code has subsided.  Eventually,
perhaps, all architectures will make similar changes and the bootmem code
can be removed entirely.  Meanwhile, Yinghai has a <a
href="/Articles/382571/">new set of changes</a> on the horizon for 2.6.35:
replacing the early_res code with the "logical memory block" allocator
currently used by some other architectures.  That change looks even more
disruptive than the bootmem elimination was.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems offhand that this won't offer much improvement, seeing as how it only affects a small part of the boot process.  Can someone enlighten me?<br>

Me too!<br>
<p>
Has this real impact, or "only" less code in the future? (Of course, that is not only, but as a kernel *user*, I'd like to know what's innit for me ;-) )<br>

Less code means less maintenance (mainly less time spent understanding code when something around that area breaks).<br>
<p>
Less code with the same functionality and performance usually means happy developers, smaller code size in memory, and, on the long term, less bugs (yes, there are always exceptions).<br>

           <p>July 6, 2016</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Jani Nikula</p>
           </div>
<p>The last time LWN looked at <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/671496/">formatted kernel documentation</a>
in January, it seemed like the merging of <a
href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> support for the
kernel's structured source-code documentation ("kernel-doc") comments, was
imminent. As Jonathan Corbet, in the capacity of the kernel documentation
maintainer, wrote: "<q>A good-enough solution that exists now
should not be held up overly long in the hopes that vague ideas for
something else might turn into real, working code.</q>" Sometimes,
however, the threat that something not quite perfect might be merged
is enough to motivate people to turn those vague ideas into something
real.</p>

<p>In the end, <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> and <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> are
emerging as the future of Linux kernel documentation, with far more
ambitious goals than the original AsciiDoc support patches ever had. With
the bulk of the infrastructure work now merged to the <tt>docs-next</tt>
branch headed for v4.8, 
it's a good time to reflect on how this came to happen and give an overview
of the promising future of kernel documentation.</p>
<p>
<h4>Background</h4>

<p>The patches to support lightweight markup (initially using <a
href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, later
AsciiDoc) in kernel-doc comments were borne out of a desire to write better
documentation for the graphics subsystem. One of the goals was to enhance
the in-source graphics subsystem internals documentation
for two main reasons. First, if the documentation is next
to the code it describes, the documentation has a better chance of being
updated along with the code. Second, if the documentation can be written in
plain text 
rather than DocBook XML, it's more likely to be written in the first
place.</p>

<p>However, plain text proves to be just a little too plain when you
venture beyond documenting functions and types, or if you want to
generate pretty HTML or PDF documents out of it. Adding support for
lightweight markup in the kernel-doc comments was the natural thing to
do. However, bolting this to the existing DocBook toolchain turned out
to be problematic.</p>

<p> As part of the documentation build process, the
<tt>scripts/kernel-doc</tt> script extracts the structured comments and
emits them in DocBook format. The <tt>kernel-doc</tt> script supports some
structure but fairly little formatting. To fit into this scheme, the
lightweight markup support 
patches caused <tt>kernel-doc</tt> to invoke an external conversion tool
(initially <tt>pandoc</tt>, later <tt>asciidoc</tt>) on each documentation
comment block to convert them from lightweight markup to DocBook. This was
painfully slow.</p>

<p>Doing the conversion in <tt>kernel-doc</tt> kept the DocBook pipeline
side of things mostly intact and oblivious to any markup, but it added
another point of failure in the already long and fragile path from comments
to HTML or PDF. Problems with markup and mismatches at each point of conversion
made debugging challenging.  The tools involved were not designed to
work together and often disagreed about when and how markup should be
applied.</p> 

<p>It was clear that this was not the best solution, but at the time it
worked and there was nothing else around.</p>

<p>
<h4>AsciiDoc all-in, muddying the waters</h4>

<p>Inspired by Jonathan's article and frustrated by the long documentation
build times (we were testing the patches in the Intel graphics integration
tree), I had the idea to make <tt>kernel-doc</tt> output AsciiDoc
directly instead of DocBook. Converting the few structural features in the
comments to 
AsciiDoc and just passing through the rest was trivial; <tt>kernel-doc</tt>
already supported several output formats with reasonable abstractions. Like
many ideas, this was the obvious thing to doâ€”in retrospect. Suddenly, this
opened the door to writing all of the high-level documents under
<tt>Documentation/DocBook</tt> in AsciiDoc, embedding the documentation
comments at that level, and getting rid of the DocBook template files
altogether. This has massive benefits, and Jonathan soon followed up with a
<a 
href="http://mid.gmane.org/1453764522-29030-1-git-send-email-corbet&#64;lwn.net">proof-of-concept</a>
that did just that.</p>

<p>There was a little bit of excited buzz around this, with folks
exploring, experimenting, and actually trying things out with document
conversion.  A number of conversations between interested developers at
linux.conf.au seemed to further confirm that this was the path forward.
But, just when it felt like people were settling on switching to
doing everything in AsciiDoc, Jonathan <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160213145317.247c63c7&#64;lwn.net">muddied the
waters</a> by taking a hard look at Sphinx as an alternative to
AsciiDoc.</p>
<p>
<h4>Sphinx vs. AsciiDoc</h4>

<p>Sphinx is a documentation generator that uses reStructuredText as its
markup language, extending and using <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">Docutils</a> for parsing. Both
Sphinx and Docutils were
created in Python to document Python, but documenting C and C++ is also
supported. Sphinx supports several output formats directly, such as HTML,
LaTeX, and ePub, and supports PDF output via either LaTeX or the external
<a href="https://github.com/rst2pdf/rst2pdf"><tt>rst2pdf</tt></a> tool.</p> 

<p>The
AsciiDoc format, on the other hand, is semantically equivalent to DocBook
XML, with the DocBook constructs expressed in terms of lightweight
markup. AsciiDoc is easier for humans to read and write than XML, but since
it is designed to translate to DocBook, it fits nicely in front of an
existing DocBook toolchain. The original Python AsciiDoc tool has been
around for a long time, but has been superseded by a Ruby reimplementation
called <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> in recent
years. As far as the AsciiDoc markup goes, Asciidoctor was designed to
be a drop-in replacement, but any extensions are implementation-specific
due to the change in implementation language. Both tools support HTML and
DocBook output natively; other output formats are generated from DocBook.</p>

<p>When comparing the markup formats for the purposes of kernel
documentation, only the table support, which is much needed for the media
subsystem documentation in particular, was clearly identified as being
superior in AsciiDoc. Otherwise, the markup comparison was rather
dispassionate; it really boiled down to the tools themselves and, to some
extent, which languages the tools were written in. Indeed, the markups and
tools were not independent choices. All the lightweight markups have their
pros and cons.</p>

<p>Superficially, the implementation language of the tools shouldn't play
any role in the decision. But it seemed that neither tool would work
as-is, or at least we wouldn't be able to get their full potential
without extending the tools ourselves. In the kernel tree, there are no
tools written in Ruby, but there are plenty of tools written in
Python. It was fairly easy to lean towards Sphinx in this regard.</p>

<p>If you are looking for flexibility, one great advantage of AsciiDoc is
that it's so closely tied to DocBook. By switching to AsciiDoc, the
kernel documentation could reuse the existing DocBook toolchain. The
downside is that AsciiDoc would add another step in front of the already
fragile DocBook toolchain. <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/8/184">Dan Allen of Asciidoctor said</a>: "<q>One of the
key goals of the Asciidoctor project is to be able to directly produce a
wide variety of outputs from the same source (without DocBook).</q>"
However, this support isn't quite there yet.</p>

<p>The Asciidoctor project has a promising future. But Sphinx is stable,
available now, and fits the needs of the kernel. <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/CACxGe6ueYTEZjmVwV2P1JQea8b9Un5jLca6+MdUkAHOs2+jiMA&#64;mail.gmail.com">Grant
Likely summed it up</a> this way: "<q>Honestly, in the end I think
we could make either tool do what is needed of it. However, my impression
after trying to do a document that needs to have nice publishable output
with both tools is that Sphinx is easier to work with, simpler to extend,
better supported.</q>"
In the end, Jonathan's verdict was to go with Sphinx.  The patches have
been merged, and the first Sphinx-based documentation will appear in the
4.8 kernel.

The <a href="/Articles/692705/">second and final part of this series</a>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  So, this is the acceptance of Knuth's concept of literate programming, or are we still not there yet?</font><br>
<p>
long long way from Knuth's literate programming.<br>
<p>
LP wasn't just about writing better comments.  It also involved changing the order in which code was written so that ideas could be developed in an order that made sense to the human reader, often quite different to the order that the compiler wants.<br>
This isn't just re-arranging function declarations.  It might also mean writing a rough outline of a function with various "blanks", then filling in the blanks one by one after explaining them.<br>
<p>
I think literate programing can work very well when the programmer fully understands the problem they are trying to solve and can then present it coherently as a lesson to the reader.  A lesson which can be compiled and run to show that it works.<br>
I don't think it works well at all for code which is being built by engineers who are coming to understand the problem as they go (most of us) and for whom the requirements change between the start and end of the project (though of course, that would never happen!).<br>
<p>
I think that for code that is under development, having significant documentation in with the code is a mistake as it is very likely to become out of date quickly.  Having documentation in with the code only makes sense (to me) once the code has stabilized.  Then there is at least some chance that the documentation will be vaguely accurate for more than one day.<br>
<p>
Certainly some people can make the effort to update documentation whenever they change the code. Both of the people who do that are worth their weight in gold and I respect them.  But I doubt I could ever emulate them.<br>

It has, in fact, been my experience that software developers will avoid writing prose longer than a line on IRC. They will got great lengths to avoid it, up to and including standing between decorative bushes of vegetation while wearing camouflage clothing.<br>

I feel compelled to quote some wise words from a favorite novel by Jane Austen:<br>
<p>
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument<br>
in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They<br>
have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the<br>
same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my<br>
own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising.<br>

Just a quick ref., cause... I knew the woman who knew the man who... and also cause it seems to me it's worth reading or listening (again).<br>

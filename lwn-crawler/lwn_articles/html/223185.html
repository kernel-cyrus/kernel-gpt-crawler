<h1>Clockevents and dyntick</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 21, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
One of the last patch sets to be merged before the 2.6.21 window closed
was the clockevents and dyntick work from the real-time tree.  These
patches have been in the works for some time, and were originally targeted
for merging in 2.6.19.  In the process, the developers (primarily Ingo
Molnar and Thomas Gleixner) discovered one of the fundamental laws of
kernel development: if your patches break Andrew Morton's laptop, they are
unlikely to make it into the mainline.  That little difficulty has now been
overcome, with the result that 2.6.21 will include some interesting core
changes.
<p>

Dealing with clock devices has traditionally been handled in the
kernel's architecture-specific code.  The result has been a lot of
duplicated code between 
architectures (there are more architectures than common timer devices) and
no uniform interface for the core kernel to make use of these devices.
John Stultz's generic time of day infrastructure resolved a number of those
problems, at least for the timekeeping task, but anybody who wanted to
program timer devices in a more general way still ended up dealing with
architecture-specific code.
<p>

The "clockevents" patch set finishes this job.  At its core, clockevents
creates a driver API for devices which can deliver interrupts at a specific
time in the future.  The API tracks the capabilities of each timer
(resolution and whether it can do one-shot or periodic interrupts, for
example) and provides a simple 
interface for arming the timer.  This API is defined in the core kernel,
with only a low-level driver remaining in the architecture-specific code.
The end result is that the kernel now has the means to query and use timer
capabilities in an architecture-independent manner.
<p>

With the clockevents mechanism in place, it becomes possible to support
truly high-resolution timers.  When such a timer is requested, all that
is required is to pick a suitable clockevent device and arm it for the
desired time.  These devices can deliver interrupts with a high degree of
precision, with the result that kernel timers, too, can offer high
precision -  a feature which is of clear utility to real-time users (among
others). 
<p>

The periodic timer tick is now implemented with a clockevent as well.  It
does all of the things the old timer-based interrupt did - updating
<tt>jiffies</tt>, accounting CPU time, etc. - but it is run out of the new
infrastructure.
<p>

All of this is an improvement, but there is still one thing which could be
better: there is no real need for a periodic tick in the system.  That is
especially true when the processor is idle.  An idle CPU can save quite a
bit of power, but waking that CPU up 100 times (or more) per second will
hurt those power savings considerably.  With a flexible timer
infrastructure, there is no point in turning the CPU back on until it has
something to do.  So, when the (i386) kernel goes into its idle loop, it
checks the next pending timer event.  If that event is further away than
the next tick, the periodic tick is turned off altogether; instead, the
timer is is programmed to fire when the next event comes due.  The CPU can
then rest unharrassed until that time - unless an interrupt comes in
first.  Once the processor goes out of the idle state, the periodic tick is
restored.
<p>

What's in 2.6.21 is, thus, not a full dynamic tick implementation.
Eliminating the tick during idle times is a good step forward, but there is
value in getting rid of the tick while the system is running as well -
especially on virtualized systems which may be sharing a host with quite a
few other clients.  The dynamic tick documentation file suggests that the
developers have this goal in mind:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The implementation leaves room for further development like full
	tickless systems, where the time slice is controlled by the
	scheduler, variable frequency profiling, and a complete removal of
	jiffies in the future.
</div>
<p>
So expect some interesting work in the future - the removal of
<tt>jiffies</tt> alone has a number of interesting implications.  The
developers also have support for the x86_64 and ARM architectures, though
that support has not been merged for 2.6.21; MIPS and PowerPC support is in
the works as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Just as a historic side note, support for disabling the timer tick during <br>
idle was first merged three years ago for the s390 architecture, see <br>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/82378/">http://lwn.net/Articles/82378/</a>. The first lwn coverage I could find on the <br>
topic is <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0412/bigpage.php3#kernel">http://lwn.net/2001/0412/bigpage.php3#kernel</a>, another three years <br>
earlier, with a patch against the 2.4.3 kernel.<br>

      IBM was pretty big on the tickless kernel idea quite awhile ago, probably due to their emphasis on hypervisors and virtualization.  Separately, the ARM branch has been big on it for the embedded space.<br>
<p>
It looks like the major difference is that clockevents gives an abstraction layer for the clock.  Once all the arches are synced up to that, I wonder if dyntick becomes the default?<br>

      Has anyone seen any benchmarks on this ?  I would expect no impact on performance, but I'm wondering how significant the power savings could be.<br>

      I haven't seen benchmarks on this in particular, but I remember reading a piece a while ago where a guy claimed that his laptop battery lasts TWICE as long with a 100Hz tick than with a 1000Hz tick... So, I'm expecting great things...<br>

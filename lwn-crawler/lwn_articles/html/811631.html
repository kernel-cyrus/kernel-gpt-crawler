<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 7, 2020</br>
           </div>
One of the more eyebrow-raising features to go into the 5.6 kernel is the
ability to load TCP congestion-control algorithms as <a
href="/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> programs; 
networking developer Toke Høiland-Jørgensen <a
href="/ml/bufferbloat/87bls8bnsm.fsf@toke.dk/">described it</a> as a
continuation of the kernel's "<q>march towards becoming BPF
runtime-powered microkernel</q>".  On its
face, congestion control is a significant new functionality to hand over to
BPF, taking it far
beyond its existing capabilities.  When one looks closer, though, one's
eyebrow altitude may well increase further; the implementation of this
feature breaks new ground in a couple of areas.
<p>
The use case for this feature seems clear enough.  There are a number of
such algorithms in use, 
each of which is suited for a different networking environment.  There may
be good reasons to distribute an updated or improved version of an algorithm and for
recipients to be able to make use of it without building a new kernel or
even rebooting.  Networking developers can certainly benefit from being
able to play with congestion-control code on the fly.  One could argue that
congestion control is not conceptually different from other tasks, such as
<a href="/Articles/764200/">flow dissection</a> or <a
href="/Articles/759188/">IR protocol decoding</a>, that can be done with BPF now —
but congestion control does involve a rather higher level of complexity.
<p>
A look at <a
href="/ml/netdev/20191231062037.280596-1-kafai@fb.com/">the patch set</a>
posted by Martin KaFai Lau reveals that what has been merged for
5.6 is not just a mechanism for hooking in TCP congestion-control
algorithms; it is far more general than that.  To be specific, this new
infrastructure can be used to allow a BPF program to replace any
"operations structure" — a structure full of function pointers — in the
kernel.  It is, at this point, only capable of replacing the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5/source/include/net/tcp.h#L1043"><tt>tcp_congestion_ops</tt>
structure</a> used for congestion control; experience suggests, though,
that other uses will show up sooner rather than later.
<p>
<h4>The user-space API</h4>
<p>
On the user-space side, loading a new operations structure requires a
few steps, the first of which is to use the <a
href="http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt>
system call</a> to load an implementation of
each function as a separate BPF program.  The new
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS</tt> type has been defined for these
programs.  In the attributes passed with each program, user space must
provide the BPF type format (BTF) ID corresponding to the structure being
replaced (specifying the actual function being implemented comes later).
BTF is a relatively recent addition that describes the functions and
data structures in the running kernel; it is currently used for <a
href="/Articles/803258/">type-checking of tracing functions</a> among other
purposes.
<p>
User space must also specify an integer offset identifying the function
this program will replace.  For example, the <tt>ssthresh()</tt> member of
<tt>struct tcp_congestion_ops</tt> is the sixth field defined there, so
this offset will be passed as five (since offsets start at zero).  How this
API might interact with <a href="/Articles/722293/">structure layout
randomization</a> is not entirely clear.
<p>
As the programs for each structure member are loaded, the kernel
will return a file descriptor corresponding to each.  Then, user space must
populate a structure that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bpf_tcp_congestion_ops {
	refcount_t refcnt;
	enum bpf_struct_ops_state state;
	struct tcp_congestion_ops data;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>data</tt> field has the type of the structure to be replaced —
<tt>struct tcp_congestion_ops</tt> in this case.  Rather than containing
function pointers, though, this structure should contain the file
descriptors for the programs that have been loaded to implement those
functions.  The non-function fields of that structure should be set as
needed, though the kernel can override things as described below.
<p>
The last step is to load this structure into the kernel.  One might imagine
a number of ways of doing this; the actual implementation is almost
certainly something else.  User space must create a special BPF map with
the new <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS</tt> type.  Associated with this map is
the BTF type ID of a special structure in the kernel (described below);
that is how the map 
is connected with the structure that is to be replaced.  Actually replacing
the structure is accomplished by storing the
<tt>bpf_tcp_congestion_ops</tt> structure filled in above into element zero
of the map.  It is also possible to query the map (to see the
reference-count and state fields) or to remove the structure by deleting
element zero.
<p>
BPF maps have grown in features and capability over the years.  Even so,
this seems likely to be the first place where map operations have this kind
of side effect elsewhere in the kernel.  It is arguably not the most
elegant of interfaces; most user-space developers will never see most of
it, though, since it is, like most of the BPF API, hidden behind a set of
macros and magic object-file sections in the <tt>libbpf</tt> library.
<p>
<h4>The kernel side</h4>
<p>

Replacing an operations structure requires support in the kernel; there is
no ability for user space to replace arbitrary structures at will.  To make
it possible to replace a specific type of structure, kernel code must
create a structure like this:
<p>
<pre>
    #define BPF_STRUCT_OPS_MAX_NR_MEMBERS 64
    struct bpf_struct_ops {
	const struct bpf_verifier_ops *verifier_ops;
	int (*init)(struct btf *btf);
	int (*check_member)(const struct btf_type *t,
			    const struct btf_member *member);
	int (*init_member)(const struct btf_type *t,
			   const struct btf_member *member,
			   void *kdata, const void *udata);
	int (*reg)(void *kdata);
	void (*unreg)(void *kdata);
	const struct btf_type *type;
	const struct btf_type *value_type;
	const char *name;
	struct btf_func_model func_models[BPF_STRUCT_OPS_MAX_NR_MEMBERS];
	u32 type_id;
	u32 value_id;
    };
</pre>
<p>
There are more details here than can be easily covered in this article, and some of
the fields of this structure are automatically filled in by macros.  The
<tt>verifier_ops</tt> structure has a number of functions  used to verify
that the individual replacement functions are safe to execute.  There is a
new field added to that structure in this patch set,
<tt>struct_access()</tt>, which regulates 
which parts, if any, of the operations structure itself can be changed by
BPF functions.
<p>
The <tt>init()</tt> function will be called first to do
any needed global setup.
<tt>check_member()</tt> determines whether a specific
member of the target structure is allowed to be implemented in BPF, while
<tt>init_member()</tt> verifies the exact value of any fields in that
structure.  In particular, <tt>init_member()</tt> can validate non-function
fields (flags fields, for example).  The <tt>reg()</tt> function actually
registers the replacement structure after the checks have passed; in the
congestion-control case, it will install the <tt>tcp_congestion_ops</tt>
structure (with the appropriate BPF trampolines used for the function
pointers) where the network stack will use it.  <tt>unreg()</tt> undoes
that action.
<p>
One structure of this type should be created with a specific name: the type
of the structure to be replaced with <tt>bpf_</tt> prepended.  So the
operations structure for the replacement of a <tt>tcp_congestion_ops</tt>
structure is named <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/ipv4/bpf_tcp_ca.c#n241"><tt>bpf_tcp_congestion_ops</tt></a>.
This is the "special structure" that user space must reference (via its BTF
ID) when loading a new operations structure.
Finally, a line is added to <tt>kernel/bpf/bpf_struct_ops_types.h</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    BPF_STRUCT_OPS_TYPE(tcp_congestion_ops)
</pre>
<p>
The lack of a trailing semicolon is necessary.  By virtue of some macro
magic and including this file four times into <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/bpf_struct_ops.c"><tt>bpf_struct_ops.c</tt></a>, 
everything is set up without the need of a special function to register
this structure type.
<p>
<h4>In closing</h4>
<p>
For the curious, the kernel-side implementation of
<tt>tcp_congestion_ops</tt> replacement can be found in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/ipv4/bpf_tcp_ca.c"><tt>net/ipv4/bpf_tcp_ca.c</tt></a>.
There are two actual algorithm implementations (<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/09903869f69f">DCTCP</a> and <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6de4a9c430b5">CUBIC</a>) in the tree as
well.
<p>
The ability to replace an arbitrary operations structure in the kernel
potentially holds a lot of power; a huge portion of kernel code is invoked
through at least one such structure.  If one could replace all or part of
the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5/source/include/linux/lsm_hooks.h#L1831"><tt>security_hook_heads</tt>
structure</a>, one could modify security policies in arbitrary ways,
similar to what is proposed with <a href="/Articles/808048/">KRSI</a>, for example.
Replacing a <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1821"><tt>file_operations</tt>
structure</a> could rewire just about any part of the kernel's I/O
subsystem.  And so on.
<p>
Nobody is proposing to do any of these things — yet — but this
sort of capability is sure to attract interested users.  There could come a
time when just about any kernel functionality is amenable to being hooked or
replaced with BPF code from user space.  In such a world, users will
have a lot of power to change how their systems operate, but what we think
of as a "Linux kernel" will become rather more amorphous, dependent on
which code has been loaded from user space.  The result is likely to be
interesting.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

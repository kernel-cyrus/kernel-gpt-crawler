<h1>UKUUG: Arnd Bergmann on interconnecting with PCIe</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>November 19, 2008</br>
           </div>
<p>
PCI express (PCIe) is not normally considered as a way to connect
computers, rather it is a bus for attaching peripherals, but there are
advantages to using it as an interconnect.  Kernel hacker Arnd Bergmann gave a
presentation at the recent <a
href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/">UKUUG Linux 2008
conference</a> on work he has been doing on using PCIe for IBM.  He
outlined the current state of Linux support as well as some plans for the
future.
</p>

<p>
The availability of PCIe endpoints for much of the hardware in use today is
one major advantage.  By using PCIe, instead of other interconnects such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniband">InfiniBand</a>, the same
throughput can be achieved with lower latency and 
power consumption.  Bergmann noted that avoiding using a separate
InfiniBand chip saves 10-30 watts which adds up rather quickly on a 30,000
node supercomputer.
</p>

<p>
There are some downsides to PCIe as well. There is no security model, for
example, so a root process on one machine can crash other connected machines.
There is also a single point of failure because if the PCIe root port goes
down, it takes the network with it or, as Bergmann puts it: "<q>if
anything goes wrong, the whole system goes down</q>".  PCIe lacks a
standard high-level interface for Linux and there is no generic code shared
between the various drivers&mdash;at least so far.
</p>

<p>
As an example of a system that uses PCIe, Bergmann described the
"Roadrunner" supercomputer that is currently the fastest in existence.  It
is a cluster of hybrid nodes, called "Triblades", each of which has one
Opteron blade along 
with two Cell blades.  The nodes are connected with
InfiniBand, but PCIe is used to communicate between the processors within
each node by using the Opteron root port and PCIe endpoints on the Cells. 
</p>

<p>
There is other hardware that uses PCIe in this way, including the Fixstars
GigaAccel 180 accelerator board and an embedded PowerPC 440/460
system-on-a-chip (SoC) board, both of which use the same Axon PCIe device.
Bergmann also talked about PCIe switches and non-transparent bridges that
perform the same 
kinds of functions as networking switches and bridges.  Bridges are called
"non-transparent" because they have I/O remapping tables&mdash;sometimes
IOMMUs&mdash;that can be addressed by the two root ports that are connected via
the bridge.  These bridges may also have DMA engines to facilitate data transfer
without host processor control.  
</p>

<p>
Bergmann then moved on to the software side of things, looking at the
drivers available&mdash;and planned&mdash;to support connection via PCIe.
The first driver was written by Mercury Computers in 2006 for a Cell
accelerator board and is now "abandonware".  It has many deficiencies and
would take a lot of work to get it into shape for the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Another choice is the driver used in the Roadrunner Triblade and the
GigaAccel device which is vaguely modeled on InfiniBand.  It has an
interface that uses custom <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands that implement just
eight operations, as opposed to hundreds for InfiniBand.  It is
"<q>enormous for a Linux device driver</q>", weighing in at 13,000
lines of code.  
</p>

<p>
The Triblade driver is not as portable as it could be, as it is very
specific to the Opteron and Cell architectures.  On the Cell side, it is
implemented as an Open Firmware driver, but the Opteron side is a PCIe
driver.  There is a lot of virtual ethernet code mixed in as well.
Overall, it is not seen as the best way forward to support these kinds of
devices in Linux.
</p>

<p>
Another approach was taken by a group of students sponsored by IBM who
developed a virtual ethernet prototype to talk to an IBM BladeCenter from a
workstation by way of a non-transparent bridge.  Each side could access
memory on the other by using <tt>ioremap()</tt> on one side and
<tt>dma_map_single()</tt> on the other.  By implementing a virtio driver,
they did not have to write an ethernet driver, as the virtio abstraction
provided that functionality.  The driver was a bit slow, as it didn't use
DMA, but it is a start down the road that Bergmann thinks should be taken.
</p>

<p>
He went on to describe a "conceptual driver" for PCIe endpoints that is
based on the students' work but adds on things like DMA as well as
additional virtio drivers.  Adding a virtio block device would allow
embedded devices to use hard disks over PCIe or, by implementing a Plan 9
filesystem (9pfs) virtio driver, individual files could be used directly
over PCIe.  All of this depends on using the virtio abstraction.
</p>

<p>
Virtio is seen as a useful layer in the driver because it is a standard
abstraction for "<q>doing something when you aren't limited by
hardware</q>".  Networking, block device, and filesystem "hosts" are all
implemented atop virtio drivers, which makes them available fairly easily.
One problem area, though, is the runtime configuration piece.  The problem
there is "<q>not in coming up with something that works, but something that
will also work in the future</q>".  
</p>

<p>
Replacing the <tt>ioctl()</tt> interface with the InfiniBand verbs (ibverb)
interface is planned.  The ibverb interface may not be the best choice in
an abstract sense, but it exists and supports <a
href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a>, so the new driver
should implement it as well.
</p>

<p>
Two types of virtqueue implementations are envisioned, one for
memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) and the other for a DMA-based virtqueue.  The MMIO
would be the most basic virtqueue implementation, with a local read of a
remote write.  Read access on PCIe is much slower than write because a read
must flush all writes then wait for data reception.  Data and signaling
information would have separate areas so that data ordering guarantees
could be relaxed on the data area for better performance, while strict data
ordering would be set for the signalling area.
</p>

<p>
The DMA engine virtqueue implementation would be highly hardware-specific
to incorporate performance and other limitations of the underlying engine.
In some cases, for example, it is not worth setting up a DMA for transfers
of less than 2K, so copying via MMIO should be used instead.  DMA would be
used for transferring payload data, but signaling would still be handled
via MMIO.  Bergmann noted that the kernel DMA abstraction may not provide
all that is needed so enhancements to that interface may be required as
well.
</p>

<p>
Bergmann did not provide any kind of time frame in which this work might
make its way into the kernel as it is a work in progress.  There is much
still to be done, but his presentation laid out a roadmap of where he
thinks it is headed.  
</p>

<p>
In a post-talk email exchange, Bergmann points to his <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/arnd/cell-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=triblade-2.6.27">triblade-2.6.27</a>
branch for those interested in looking at the current state of affairs, while noting that it "<q>is only mildly related to what I think
we should be 
doing</q>".  He also mentioned a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/307774/">patch by Ira Snyder</a> that
implements virtual ethernet over PCI, which "<q>is more
likely to go into the kernel in the near future</q>".  Bergmann
and Snyder have to agreed to join forces down the road to add more
functionality along the lines that were outlined in the talk.

I recently learned about the mvXCell from MATRIX VISION, which is another <br>
OEM version of the GigaAccel 180 and is now available in Europe as well.<br>
It runs the same device drivers, meaning that we're also targetting it <br>
with this work. <br>

This triblade concept of linking an Opteron with Cell over PCIe sounds highly interesting. But I doubt it is an SSI, is it?<br>
<p>
I'd really wish there was SSI hardware with different CPU types. That could aid in software development, or just for the fun of possessing one. Something unlike Cell though (SPU/SPE are all in the PPC group, kinda boring)  what I think of is more like a mainboard with, say, one AMD64 core, one IA64 core and a SPARC64 core.<br>

IBM, as you probably know, is about a decade or two ahead of everybody else in terms of virtualization. In the past they've offered POWER boxes that had a add-on Xeon processor so that you can run Windows along side AIX and Linux on the same machine.<br>
<p>
This seems like a extension of that.<br>

The kernel's live-patching (KLP) mechanism can apply a wide variety of
fixes to a running kernel but, at a first glance, the sort of highly
intrusive changes needed to address vulnerabilities like Meltdown or L1TF
would not seem like likely candidates for live patches.
The most notable obstacles are the required
modifications of global semantics on a running system, as well as the
need for live patching the kernel's entry code. However, we at the SUSE live
patching team started working on proof-of-concept live patches for these
vulnerabilities as a
fun project and have been able to overcome these hurdles. The 
techniques we developed are generic and might become handy again when
fixing future vulnerabilities.
<p>
For completeness, it should be noted that these two demo live patches
have been implemented for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGraft">kGraft</a>, but kGraft is
conceptually equivalent to KLP.

<p>
At the heart of the Meltdown vulnerability is the CPU speculating past
the access rights encoded in the page table entries (PTEs) and
thereby enabling malicious user-space programs to extract data from
any kernel mapping. The <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation
(KPTI) mechanism</a> blocks such attacks by switching to stripped-down
"shadow" page tables whenever the kernel returns to user space. These
mirror the mappings from the lower, user-space half of the address
space, but lack almost anything from the kernel region except for
the bare minimum needed to reenter the kernel and switch back
to the fully populated page tables. The
difficulty, from a live-patching perspective, is to keep the
retroactively introduced shadow page tables consistent with their
fully populated counterparts at all times.
Furthermore, the entry code
has to be made to switch back and forth between the full and shadow page
table at kernel 
entries and exits, but that is outside of the scope of what is live
patchable with KLP.
<p>
For the L1TF vulnerability, recall that each PTE has a <tt>_PAGE_PRESENT</tt>
bit that, when clear, causes page faults upon accesses to the
corresponding virtual memory region. The PTE bits
designated for storing a page's frame number are
architecturally ignored in this case. The Linux kernel swapping
implementation exploits this by marking the PTEs corresponding to
swapped-out pages as non-present and reusing the physical address
part to store the page's swap slot number.  Unfortunately, CPUs
vulnerable to L1TF do not always ignore the contents of these "swap
PTEs", but can instead speculatively misinterpret the swap slot identifiers
as physical addresses. These swap slot identifiers, being index-like
in nature, tend to alias with valid physical page-frame numbers, so
this speculation allows for extraction of the corresponding memory
contents. The <a href="/Articles/762570/">Linux kernel
mitigation</a> is 
to avoid this aliasing by bit-wise inverting certain parts of the swap
PTEs. Unfortunately, this change of representation is again something
which is not safely applicable to a running system with KLP's
consistency guarantees alone.

<p>
<h4>Global consistency</h4>
<p>
When a live patch is applied, the system is migrated to the new
implementation at task granularity by virtue of KLP's so-called
<a href="/Articles/634649/">per-task consistency model</a>. In particular,
it is guaranteed that, for all functions changed by a live patch, no
unpatched functions will ever be executing on the same call stack as any
patched function.
<p>
Clearly, it might take some time after live-patch application until
each and every task in the system has been found in a safe state and
been migrated to the new code. The crucial point is that, while a single
task will 
never be executing simultaneously in both the original and the patched
implementation, different tasks can and will do that during the
transition. It follows that a live patch must not change global
semantics, at least not without special care.
<p>
The standard example for a forbidden change of global semantics would
be the inversion of some locking order: as both orderings could be
encountered concurrently during the transition period, an ABBA
deadlock would become possible. Other (and more relevant) examples in
this case include:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The bit-wise inversion of swap PTEs for mitigating against L1TF:
     imagine what would happen if an unpatched kernel function that
     interprets PTE entries encountered an inverted PTE.

<li> Shadowing of page tables (i.e. KPTI): imagine some unpatched
     page-table modifying code not properly propagating its changes to some
     shadow copy.
</ul>
<p>
What these examples have in common is that it is possible to
disambiguate between the original and the new semantics by inspection
of the state in question. For the case of inverted swap PTEs,
this becomes apparent when taking into account that the higher 18&nbsp;bits
of a swap PTE are always unused on x86_64; swap offsets handed out by
the memory-management code don't ever exceed 32&nbsp;bits. Thus, the higher
bits all are all unset in non-inverted swap PTEs and set for the
inverted ones. For the shadow page table example, a page table has
either been shadowed already and thus, the new semantics apply to it
or not.
<p>
For this class of problems where a disambiguation is possible, the
following scheme for the safe modification of global semantics
suggests itself:
<p>
<ol class="spacylist">

<li> Live patch all state accessors to be able to recognize and handle
   both the original and modified semantics.
<li> Wait for the live-patch transition to finish globally.
<li> Start introducing the modified semantics only thereafter.  For example,
   start inverting swap PTEs, creating page table shadow copies, and so
   on.
</ol>
<p>
Because any modification of the semantics will happen only after the
patching has completed, it will be impossible to have an unpatched
state accessor to encounter the modified semantics.
<p>
Now, how does the live-patch module determine when the transition has
finished? With <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/93862e385ded">the
callbacks mechanism merged in 4.15</a>, this 
would be straightforward: simply register a <tt>post_patch()</tt> callback and
wait for its invocation. For pre-4.15 kernels, 
the <tt>post_patch()</tt> callback functionality can be emulated by live
patching the KLP core itself, namely its housekeeping code to be
executed after a transition has finished.
<p>

Finally, the last remaining problem is to deal with the reverse transition
of "unpatching".  Users may disable loaded live patches or, with the
pending <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181129094431.7801-1-pmladek@suse.com/">"atomic
replace" patch set</a>, downgrade to a cumulative live patch not
containing some fix in question. Obviously, any change to global semantics
must be rolled back before any of the live-patched state accessors might
become unpatched again. For patch disabling (as opposed to downgrades),
this is easy; from 
the <tt>pre_unpatch()</tt> callback, which, as the name suggests, gets
invoked right before such a transition is actually started:
<p>
<ol class="spacylist">
<li> Stop introducing new uses of the changed semantics: stop
   creating page table shadows, stop inverting swap PTEs, and so
   on. This can usually be achieved by flipping some boolean flag and
   running some sort of synchronization like
   <tt>schedule_on_each_cpu()</tt> afterward.

<li> Undo all semantic changes that have been made up to this point;
   drop page table shadows or walk all page tables and uninvert
   any swap PTEs.
<li> Allow the unpatch transition to start.
</ol>
<p>

The situation for a transition to another cumulative live patch is more
complicated.  The current atomic replace
implementation won't invoke any callbacks from the previous live patch,
and we would like to avoid the potentially costly
rollback of semantic changes for the common case of live-patch
upgrades. For example, imagine that the old and new live patches both contain
the L1TF mitigation inverting the swap PTEs. In
this case, the swap PTEs accessors would be kept patched one way or
the other during the transition and thus, be able to handle the
inverted swap PTEs at all times. Obviously, scanning through all page
tables and unnecessarily uninverting the swap PTEs before starting the
transition would be a waste of time and should be avoided. But as it
currently stands, the previous live patch is unable to tell anything
about the contents of the next one and some help from the KLP core
would certainly be needed.
<p>

We discussed this problem at the 2018 Linux Plumbers Conference <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/178/">live
patching microconference</a>; the solution will probably be to amend the
<tt>klp_patch</tt> structure with some set of IDs representing the global states
supported by the associated live patch. For a start, we would then simply
make the KLP core disallow transitions to live patches that are not able to
maintain all of the states from the currently active set.
<p>

<h4>Live patching the entry code</h4>
<p>

A live patch implementing KPTI will have to replace the kernel's entry
code.  At each crossing of the boundary between user and kernel space, the
current page table must be switched between the shadow copy and the fully
populated original.  The problem here is that KLP is based on Ftrace, so
only functions calling <tt>mcount()</tt> from their prologue are
eligible as live-patching targets. Obviously, the entry code does not
belong to this category; it is not organized into functions to begin
with.
<p>

Fortunately, even though KLP won't be of any help when it comes to
live patching the entry code, this patching is still doable;
the basic idea is to
simply redirect all of the CPU's references to the entry code to the
respective replacements from the live-patch module. For x86, this
would amount for replacing the CPU's interrupt descriptor table (IDT)
as well as redirecting the pointers to the various system-call
handlers.
All exceptions, interrupts, and system calls can be made to enter the
kernel through the entry-code replacement this way, but newly forked
threads would still begin their execution at the hard coded
<tt>ret_from_fork</tt> entry-code address.
<p>
Depending on the target kernel's version, it is possible to cover
these threads as well:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> For 4.9 and later kernels, the
  hard-coded <tt>ret_from_fork</tt> address can be changed by live patching
  <tt>copy_thread_tls()</tt>.

<li> For earlier kernel versions, the <tt>ret_from_fork</tt> address is
  hard coded into the <tt>__schedule()</tt> path, which used to not be live
  patchable. However, the first thing the code at
  <tt>ret_from_fork</tt> does is to issue a call into
  <tt>schedule_tail()</tt>, which 
  can be live patched and made to redirect its on-stack return
  address to the entry-code replacement.
</ul>
<p>

As shown, it is not too difficult to replace the kernel's entry code from a
live-patch module. However, it is common for live-patch modules to
eventually be unloaded again, when upgrading to a newer version, for
example. Given that tasks can sleep for arbitrarily long times in system
calls or exceptions — with return addresses pointing into the
about-to-be-unmapped entry code replacement on their stack — some
precautions are needed in order to prevent these from returning into
nowhere.  A possible solution is to reference-count the entry code
replacement: increment the counter upon entry before scheduling becomes
possible and decrement it again on exit after the last such possibility.
With this in place, the following steps are sufficient to allow for a safe
unmapping of the entry code replacement:
<p>
<ol class="spacylist">

<li> Restore all CPUs' entry-code pointers from a
   <tt>schedule_on_each_cpu()</tt> call. As the increments are made before
   scheduling becomes possible, they order with
   <tt>schedule_on_each_cpu()</tt> and all pending executions of the
   entry-code replacement will have been recorded properly by the reference
   count afterward.
<li> Wait for the reference counter to drain to zero.
<li> Run an empty <tt>schedule_on_each_cpu()</tt> call. After completion,
   all tasks will have left the window between decrementing and actually
   returning to user space.
</ol>
<p>
As a final remark, let me note that getting reasonable test coverage
for entry-code live patches is quite hard, mainly because the content
of the IDT varies wildly between different configurations like
Xen guests, bare metal, and so on.
<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
As shown, the scope of KLP can be extended up to a point where live
patching to address CPU vulnerabilities becomes possible. The safe modification
of global semantics might be handy again in the future.  On the other hand,
the live 
patching of entry code, while doable in principle, poses significant
challenges to the testing infrastructure. For those cases where 
only some subset of the entry code needs to get patched, this
can become manageable though; for example, we have been able to
release production live patches fixing the <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8897">"Pop
SS" vulnerability</a>  by
replacing only the <tt>int3</tt> trap handler.
We will work on upstreaming proper support to KLP to make this kind of
patching possible; interested readers can find the Meltdown patches in <a
href="https://github.com/nicstange/meltdown-livepatch">this repository</a>,
while the L1TF patches will be coming soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It is natural, when looking at the kernel development process, to focus on
patches that find their way to acceptance and become a part of future
kernels.  But there can be value in looking at work that doesn't clear the
bar; in failing, these patches often reveal things about the kernel and the
community that creates it.  Such is the case with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211118181210.281359-1-y.karadz@gmail.com/">proof-of-concept
namespacefs
patch series</a> recently posted by Yordan Karadzhov.  One should not
expect to see namespacefs in a future kernel but, in failing, this work
showed a real use case and why it is hard to satisfy that use case in the
kernel.
<p>
Namespacefs is, as one might expect, a virtual filesystem implemented by
the kernel.  Its job is to display the hierarchy of namespaces running on
the system; this information reflects the hierarchy of
containers that are running.  By using namespacefs, administrators can more
readily see what is happening on their systems; it is also meant to
facilitate complicated use cases like tracing multiple containers and
watching how they interact.
<p>

The initial implementation was limited to the <a
href="/Articles/531419/">PID</a> and <a href="/Articles/766089/">time</a>
namespaces.  One can use it to traverse the hierarchy of PID namespaces
(time namespaces are not hierarchical) and obtain the list of processes
running in each.  Other types of namespaces are not supported in this
posting, but the intent was seemingly to add that support in a future
version if namespacefs looked like the right solution to the problem.

<p>
As Karadzhov wrote:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Being able to see the structure of the namespaces can be very
	useful in the context of the containerized workloads. This will
	provide universal methods for detecting, examining and monitoring
	all sorts of containers running on the system, without relaying on
	any specific user-space software.
</blockquote>
<p>
Much of this information is available in user space now in the form of
directories under <tt>/proc</tt>, but there are some missing pieces and
that information is not organized in a way that shows the actual namespace
hierarchy.  Container-orchestration systems can also provide a view of the
containers they manage, of course, but they don't provide a solution for
the general case.  Namespacefs was meant to make this information readily
available regardless of which orchestration systems are in use.

<p>
There were a few objections raised to this work, starting with the fact
that a namespace's entry in namespacefs needs to have a name.  There are
currently no names associated with namespaces, so namespacefs uses the
number of the inode that is attached to each namespace inside the kernel.
Eric Biederman was quick to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87a6i1xpis.fsf@email.froward.int.ebiederm.org/">criticize</a>
that approach, saying: "<q>It is not correct to use inode numbers as the
actual names for namespaces</q>".  He went on to say that there was
nothing else that could be used as names for namespaces either, and that
the entire idea was unworkable.
<p>
There are, it seems, a couple of problems with using inode numbers as names
for namespaces.  One of those, which Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87pmqxuv4n.fsf@email.froward.int.ebiederm.org/">spelled
out</a> later, is that there is no way to recreate the namespace hierarchy
at a later time
with the same names.  That, he said, would break any system that uses, for
example, <a href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">CRIU</a> to checkpoint and
restart containers, perhaps as part of a live-migration scheme.  The only
way to handle this properly, he said, is to create a namespace for
namespace names, and that has proved to be a hard problem in the past.
<p>
The CRIU issue is only relevant if containers that may be checkpointed will
use namespacefs.  As both <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1613eb28-f5d2-6ede-b0a1-f48c5ce240fc@gmail.com/">Karadzhov</a>
and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211118143634.3f7d43e9@gandalf.local.home/">Steve
Rostedt</a> pointed out, that is unlikely; the whole point of namespacefs
is to show the situation on a specific machine.  There is no reason for
anybody to want to move namespacefs — or any container making use of
namespacefs — across machines or even to checkpoint it.  It is, of course,
hazardous to assume that nobody will want to use a feature in a certain way
in the future but, in the absence of a surprising use case, the naming
problem may not be an issue in actual use.
<p>
An arguably deeper problem, though, is that namespacefs can be seen as an
attempt to recognize containers in the kernel, but the kernel has (by
design) no concept of a "container".  The kernel, instead, provides a set
of pieces 
that user-space systems can assemble into varying types of containers.
The namespacefs patches use PID namespaces as the objects
around which the hierarchy is built and ignore <a
href="/Articles/532593/">user namespaces</a> entirely.  Biederman, in his
initial response, 
criticized that decision, saying that "<q>there is definitely no meaningful
hierarchy without the user namespace</q>".  Not all containers use user
namespaces, though, and those namespaces lack the process-ID information
that Karadzhov's patch was meant to expose in the first place.
<p>
But, as James Bottomley <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f141c401560d90a546968514c6cfc63d7fdb8e00.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">pointed
out</a>, not all containers use PID namespaces either.  Trying to identify
containers without PID namespaces in namespacefs is not going to lead to
much joy.
<p>
The end result is that it appears difficult to implement something like
namespacefs in the kernel without introducing some sort of concept of what
a container is.  There is no more appetite for doing that now than <a
href="/Articles/723561/">there 
has been in past years</a>; the lack of a container abstraction in the kernel
is seen as having enabled a great deal of innovation on the user-space
side.  For this reason alone, namespacefs would be a hard sell in the
kernel community.
<p>
It also appears, though, that it should be possible to get the required
information entirely in user space by digging through a lot of
<tt>/proc</tt> files.  If there is information that is missing, it can be
added to <tt>/proc</tt> rather than introducing an entirely new
filesystem.  So that is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/e94c2ba9-226b-8275-bef7-28e854be3ffa@gmail.com/">the
approach that Karadzhov will take</a> to solve this problem.  Another proof
of concept will be put together to show how it would work.
<p>
If that implementation turns out to be difficult or
impossible to do efficiently, then there might be an argument for
reconsidering namespacefs.  Otherwise, though, a mechanism like namespacefs
seems unlikely to make it into the kernel.  That particular effort may not
have led directly to the desired result, but it did create a discussion
that coalesced on a seemingly better solution and, in the process,
highlighted some of the constraints brought by the kernel's lack of a
container concept.  A reluctance to implement policy is generally a good
thing, but it can end up making certain kinds of problems harder for users
to solve.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Surely, yes. All that innovation would be _entirely_blocked_ by having an _optional_ directly-in-kernel container abstraction, which could just mean processes couldn&#x27;t shake it off once contained in it, the container could have a sound name and the community could finally start working on direct in-kernel /proc &amp; /sys abstraction for the namespaces &amp; cgroups the container has. That&#x27;d be a nightmare world to live in :)<br>

The point is that you cannot have a &quot;container abstraction&quot;, optional or otherwise, without forcing disparate namespaces to have common boundaries.<br>
<p>
Not having an enforced boundary in namespace A just because you happen to have one in namespace B, however, is exactly what enables many of these user-space innovations.<br>

Once you have a kernel-provided abstraction, it inevitably becomes the center of gravity about which all userspace implementations must orbit, either by explicitly supporting it, or by explicitly refusing to support it. Everyone who wants to make a userspace container system has to choose whether and how to support your abstraction, and if they choose not to support it, they have to document that fact and (probably) justify it to people who want the abstraction supported. If your abstraction is good, then there is nothing wrong with this, of course, but it is equally a problem if your abstraction is leaky or only appropriate for some use cases. Therefore, before providing a new abstraction, you should be satisfied that it is a good, or at least reasonable, abstraction to provide, that you can commit to supporting it indefinitely, and that it will not sow discord amongst the existing implementations and use cases.<br>
<p>
Another perspective: The people who adopted Unicode early (Microsoft and Sun, mostly) got stuck on UTF-16, and now they can&#x27;t transition to UTF-8 without breaking backwards compatibility. It may be better to give the technology a bit longer to mature before you start kernelizing things that are already very well supported in userspace at the moment.<br>

On the other hand, it&#x27;s possible to be late in recognizing and providing a key abstraction in the kernel -- I think you could make a case for threads being an example of that. We still have some legacy warts as a result that userspace has to jump through silly hoops to work around, like the setuid syscall being per-thread, not per-process.<br>

I believe this argument was valid in the beginning. Now everyone uses only the bits they need/like, so we&#x27;re already in the future :) Not having the container abstraction has managed to get us the innovation many have imagined it would and most importantly, show us these ways of thinking clearly, with pretty exciting example use-cases. Now various system management daemons and even desktop environments use it, etc...<br>
<p>
That&#x27;s not going to go anywhere. My point is that _now_ it may finally be the right time to introduce the container abstraction. We know that we don&#x27;t want to force it onto everyone + not everyone has the same understanding what a container even is/means.<br>
<p>
Is it really so hard to imagine a &quot;uber&quot; namespace/cgroup/something, &#x27;struct ve&#x27; like OpenVZ has, or &#x27;struct jail&#x27; like FreeBSD (which already supports nesting btw), only with the upstream Linux innovation of the various cg/ns being optional? We&#x27;ve gotten here by different approach, yes. That&#x27;s good! Now we can do better than anyone has ever done so far.<br>
<p>
I think that&#x27;s rather exciting. I don&#x27;t understand this - almost dogmatic - dismissal of the idea as whole.<br>

<p>
Good example but just for Unicode completeness I think you mean: &quot;They can&#x27;t transition to UCS-4&quot;.<br>
<p>
I don&#x27;t think anyone intentionally opted for UTF-16, because it sucks as you alluded to. All APIs support either encoded strings (e,g.: UTF-8) or decoded strings (e.g.: UCS-4) whereas UTF-16 is &quot;mostly-decoded for awkward backward compatibility&quot;. Not encoded but &quot;mostly decoded&quot; - and a likely infinite source of bugs...<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m relatively confident what happened is: early Unicode adopters chose:<br>
- UCS-2 for decoded strings / wchar_t<br>
- UTF-8 for encoded strings but easily overridden by user preference.<br>
<p>
Later, Unicode said &quot;Wait, in fact we have more than 65536 characters. Sorry about that&quot;. Enters the UTF-16 hack replacing UCS-2 for _mostly decoded_ strings. The encoded APIs have not changed and still default to &quot;UTF-8 easy overridden by user preference.&quot;<br>

As I understand the history here, UTF-8 did not exist at this point. Your options were UCS-2, UCS-4, or &quot;ANSI&quot; (i.e. various legacy non-Unicode codepages such as the venerable Windows-1252). Sun and Microsoft opted for UCS-2, other vendors either picked UCS-4 or ignored the problem. Then the Unicode people realized that UCS-2 was too small to encode everything, and introduced surrogates (creating UTF-16, and renaming UCS-4 to UTF-32 for consistency).<br>
<p>
Much later, UTF-8 was introduced as a hack to make non-Unicode aware APIs (i.e. APIs which are incompatible with both UTF-16 and UTF-32, usually because they assumed &quot;no embedded nulls&quot;) handle Unicode transparently, or at least in a way that was not entirely wrong. The alternative would have been to introduce wchar_t versions of the entire POSIX API, which would have sucked (and is exactly what Windows ended up doing for backcompat with &quot;ANSI&quot; programs).<br>

UTF-1 did exist, and it was backwards (though not forwards) compatible with ASCII.<br>
<p>
Pretty much the first major adopter of Unicode was NT. And at that time they simply didn&#x27;t have anybody fluent in Chinese on the team, who would point out that there&#x27;s no way in hell 2^16 characters are going to be enough. <br>
<p>
There was not that much discussion about Unicode at that time at all, you can try searching comp.* hierarchy and barely anything comes up. So it&#x27;s no wonder that the NT development team decided to go with 16-bit encoding. And the rest was history.<br>

Windows NT 3.1 (which used UCS-2 but didn&#x27;t properly support it) was released in 1993.<br>

I don&#x27;t think it has to be wrong. Just that something was introduced at some point doesn&#x27;t mean it was actually widely used.<br>
<p>
Although I suspect that old code that assumed a fixed length encoding was probably a big factor, considering that is still a leading reason for poor unicode support today.<br>

      <blockquote>Windows NT 3.1 (which used UCS-2 but didn't properly support it) was released in 1993.</blockquote>

<p>But NT development, which is where core unicode-everywhere support was first implemented, started in 1989. Even though an NT product hadn't been released yet, they were 3 years into development using UCS-2 before UTF-8 was invented - and there was no guarantee that it would end up being the winner at the time. Even most Linux distros, with 8-bit char string APIs in the kernel, were still primarily using language-specific character encodings until the 2000s.</p>

It sounds kind of like the &quot;namespacefs&quot; concept would be best served as a fuse fs. Since it&#x27;s boundaries/hierarchy and such are at least partly defined by the container implementation.<br>
<p>
Off the top of my head I didn&#x27;t notice anything in the article that would require the implementation be in-kernel.<br>

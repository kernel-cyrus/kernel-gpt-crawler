           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 7, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2019-Kernel_Recipes">Kernel Recipes</a>
</div>
One of the many changes in the 5.4 kernel is the completion (insofar as
anything in the kernel is truly complete) of the <a
href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd API</a>.  Getting that work done has been "a
wild ride so far", according to its author Christian Brauner during <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2019/talks/pidfds-process-file-descriptors-on-linux/">a
session</a> at the 2019 Kernel Recipes conference.  He went on to describe
the history of this work and some lessons for others interested in adding
major new APIs to the Linux kernel.
<p>
A pidfd, he began, is a file descriptor that refers to a process — or, more
correctly, to a process's thread-group leader.  There do not appear to be
any use cases for pidfds that refer to an individual thread for now; such a
feature could be added in the future if the need arises.  Pidfds are stable
(they always refer to the same process) and private to the owner of the
file descriptor.  Internally to the kernel, a pidfd refers to the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/pid.h#L18"><tt>pid</tt>
structure</a> for the target process.  Other options (such as <tt>struct
task_struct</tt>) were available, but that structure is too big to pin down
indefinitely (which can be necessary, since a pidfd can be held open
indefinitely). 
<p>
Why did the kernel need pidfds?  The main driving force was the problem of
process-ID (PID) recycling.  A process ID is an integer, drawn from a (small by
default) pool; when a process exits, its ID will eventually be recycled and
assigned 
to an entirely unrelated process.  This leads to a number of security

<a href="/Articles/801323/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/kr/ChristianBrauner-sm.jpg" alt="[Christian
Brauner]" title="Christian Brauner" class="rthumb"></a>

issues when process-management applications don't notice in time that a
process ID has been reused; he put up a list of CVE numbers (visible in <a
href="https://www.slideshare.net/ennael/kernel-recipes-2019-pidfds-process-file-descriptors-on-linux">his
slides [SlideShare]</a>) for vulnerabilities resulting from PID reuse.
There have been macOS exploits as well.  It is, he said, a real issue.
<p>
Beyond that, Unix has long had a problem supporting libraries that need to
create invisible helper processes.  These processes, being subprocesses of
the main application, can end up sending signals to that application or
showing up in <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitpid.2.html"><tt>wait()</tt></a>
calls, creating confusion.  Pidfds are designed to allow the
creation of this kind of hidden process, solving a persistent, difficult
problem.  They are also useful for process-management applications that
want to delegate the handling of specific processes to a non-parent
process; the Android low-memory killer daemon (LMKD) and systemd are a couple of
examples.  Pidfds can be transferred to other processes by the usual means,
making this kind of delegation possible.
<p>
Brauner said that a file-descriptor-based abstraction was chosen
because it has been done before on other operating systems and
shown to work.  Dealing with file descriptors is a common pattern in Unix
applications.
<p>
There are, he said, quite a few user-space applications and
libraries that are interested
in using pidfds.  They include D-Bus, Qt, systemd, checkpoint-restore in
user space (CRIU), LMKD, bpftrace, and the Rust "mio" library.
<p>
<h4>Implementing pidfds</h4>
<p>
Brauner said that he started by looking at what other operating systems
have done.  He made a mistake, though, by not looking at how other systems
implemented this feature until after he had gotten code of his own
written.  Illumos has an API — <tt>procopen()</tt> and friends — that is
implemented in user space.  Neither OpenBSD nor NetBSD has a pidfd
implementation at all, but FreeBSD does in the form of its <a
href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pdfork&sektion=2">process
file descriptors</a>.  The idea is the same, but that implementation
differs in the details.
<p>
There have been previous attempts to add this idea to Linux as well, he
said.  These include a <tt>forkfd()</tt> system call and the <a
href="/Articles/636646/"><tt>CLONE_FD</tt> flag</a> for <tt>clone()</tt>.
None of these made it in; Brauner looked at them to try to figure out why.
The <tt>CLONE_FD</tt> idea in particular tried to do too many things at
once, he said.
<p>
In an attempt to avoid a similar fate, Brauner did the pidfd work over the
course of four kernel releases.  That gave him (and the community) plenty
of time to think about how the various parts of the API should work.  The
first piece that he bit off was <a href="/Articles/784831/">sending signals
to processes</a> in a race-free way; it was "the obvious use case", he
said.  People had a lot of ideas about how this feature should work, so
focusing the discussion was a bit of a challenge.  These ideas included
using <tt>/proc</tt> files, new <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls, and more; they were
all aimed at the signaling problem in particular, but he had a more general
API in mind from the beginning.  In the end, <tt>pidfd_send_signal()</tt>
went into&nbsp;5.1.
<p>
There was still a race condition involved, though, since a pidfd had to be
obtained for a process after the process had been created.  The answer was
to return a pidfd directly from <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone()</a></tt>.
There was some uncertainty about just what should be returned, though;
should it be a file descriptor referring to a <tt>/proc</tt> file or
something else?  In the end, he sent two separate RFC patch postings, one
using <tt>/proc</tt> and one using anonymous inodes instead.  The
<tt>/proc</tt> version was "nasty", he said, and would have probably led to
an eventual need to rework procfs.  After seeing the two ideas, a consensus
formed around using anonymous inodes.
<p>
One important design decision, he said, was to mark each pidfd to be closed
by default on <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"><tt>execve()</tt></a>
calls.  He didn't want to see pidfds being leaked into unrelated
applications.
<p>
Returning a pidfd from <tt>clone()</tt> was added in 5.2.  That work left
Brauner feeling a little guilty, though, since he used the last available
<tt>clone()</tt> flag bit for <tt>CLONE_PIDFD</tt>.  That led to the
implementation of <a 
href="/Articles/792628/"><tt>clone3()</tt></a>, which has a dedicated
return argument for a pidfd.  5.3 also saw the addition of polling support
for pidfds; this is important since it will be the main way to return an
exit status to non-parent processes.  <a
href="/Articles/789023/"><tt>pidfd_open()</tt></a> was also added in 5.3;
it allows the creation of a pidfd for an existing process.
<p>
In 5.4, the <tt>waitid()</tt> system call gained a new <tt>P_PIDFD</tt>
flag, allowing a process to wait on a pidfd directly.  That essentially
completes the pidfd API as it had been originally envisioned.
<p>
<h4>Future work and lessons</h4>
<p>
Like any other kernel API, pidfds will continue to evolve over time,
Brauner said.  One feature he would like to add is sending a
<tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal to a process when the last pidfd referring to it is
closed.  That is something FreeBSD supports now, but Linux will need to do
things a bit differently.  When a FreeBSD <tt>close()</tt> call returns,
all of the work in the kernel is done; Linux, instead, can defer work to a
workqueue to be done asynchronously later.  Thus, the process may continue
to exist for a while after that last <tt>close()</tt> call returns, which
may not be what the application expects.  He has
a proof-of-concept implementation of how this feature could work in Linux,
but he's not entirely happy with it yet.
<p>
Another upcoming feature is "exclusive waiting": marking a process so that
only a pidfd can be used to wait for it.  In other words, an ordinary
<tt>wait()</tt> call (or any of its variants) will not return such a
process's exit status, which will go only to a <tt>waitid()</tt> call that
provides the right pidfd.  This feature is aimed at the "invisible helper
process use case".  We probably want it, he said, but he still has to work
out all of the semantics for it.
<p>
Pidfds also need to be better integrated with the namespace mechanism.  One
potentially useful feature would be to pass a pidfd to <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns()</a></tt>;
the result would be to enter several namespaces simultaneously.  That is
not something that can be done on current Linux systems.  He is also
thinking about adding a socket option to get a pidfd rather than an
ordinary process ID for the peer on a local connection.
<p>
Brauner concluded with the lessons he has learned from this work.  The
first is that "speed matters".  But, in this case, he was not arguing for
going as fast as possible; instead he recommends picking a sustainable
speed for the addition of new features.  That will give time to respond to
people and get things right the first time.  Developers should, he said, be
open about what they don't know; that encourages other developers to help
out.  In this case, he got help from a number of senior kernel developers
while implementing pidfds.  Finally, he said, "be resilient" in the face of
reviews.  He felt that he "looked dumb" after the first posting of
<tt>pidfd_send_signal()</tt>, but he is glad he pushed through that
experience and got the work into the kernel.

ptrace() would need this.<br>
<p>
It would be great if ptrace() supported pidfds in a way that eliminates the current restriction that a task can have just one unique ptracer process *and* that ptracer cannot be changed without detaching and reattaching, i.e., so it became possible to hand off ptrace control to another ptracer process.<br>

Given that ptrace() allows the tracing process to manipulate the traced process, would this generate race conditions? I feel like you'd need to define a "read-only" context to allow multiple ptracer processes.<br>

ptrace() is a debugger interface, not a general-purpose API. If the end user really wants to attach two debuggers to the same process and send them off to the races, well, why not just let them do it? They're a programmer, they should know better.<br>

This is not just useful for multiple ptracers: it is also useful if you have a thread that wants to ptrace a victim on behalf of other threads in the tracing process. For that, you need a pollable fd that at least trips something pollable (POLLIN, say) when the victim wants attention, so that you can also poll on message pipes etc from the rest of the process. I implemented this for DTrace by reviving the old RH waitfd(), but it was really crocky compared to pidfds and I'd much rather use those.<br>
<p>
But we can't use those as long as waitid is used -- as I discovered to my cost in the waitfd implementation waitid destroys a bunch of info that waitpid returns (IIRC, the high bits of the return code, but my memory of this was faded) and which is crucial for ptrace. There's a reason all the ptrace examples use waitpid rather than waitid... a shame, because the waitid API is ever so much nicer than waitpid. (Alternatively, waitid could be fixed so it was usable to accept ptrace results -- but that seems likely to be quite difficult!)<br>

There might be a use case for pidfds referring to an individual thread: Currently, audio applications that want a thread to run with real-time priorities have to send a request (containing the kernel thread id of the target thread) to the RealtimeKit daemon. That looks like the same race condition to me.<br>

</div>
Access to main memory from the processor is mediated (and accelerated) by
the L2 and L3 memory caches; developers working on performance-critical
code quickly learn that cache utilization can have a huge effect on how
quickly an application (or a kernel) runs.  But, as Fenghua Yu noted in his
LinuxCon Japan 2016 talk, the caches are a shared resource, so even a
cache-optimal application can be slowed by an unrelated task, possibly
running on a different CPU.  Intel has been working on a mechanism that
allows a system administrator to set cache-sharing policies; the talk
described the need for this mechanism and how access to it is implemented
in the current patch set.
<p>
<h4>Control over cache usage</h4>
<p>
Yu started off by saying that a shared cache is subject to the "noisy
neighbor" problem; a program that uses a lot of cache entries can cause the
eviction of entries used by others, hurting their performance.  The L3
cache is shared by all CPUs on 
the same socket, so the annoying neighbor need not be running on the same
processor; a cache-noisy program can create problems for others running on
any CPU in the socket.  A low-priority process that causes cache churn can
slow down a much higher-priority process; increased interrupt-response
latency is another problem that often results.
<p>
The solution to the problem is to eliminate cache sharing between parts of
the system that should be isolated from each other; this is done by
partitioning the available cache.  Each partition is shared between fewer

<a href="/Articles/694872/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lcj/FenghuaYu-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Fenghua Yu]" title="Fenghua Yu" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

processes and, thus, has fewer conflicts.  There is an associated cost,
clearly, in that a process running on a partitioned cache has a smaller
cache.  That, Yu said, can affect the overall throughput of the system, but
that is a separate concern.
<p>
Intel's cache-partitioning mechanism is called "cache allocation
technology," or CAT.  Haswell-generation (and later) server chips  have
support for CAT 
at the L3 (socket) level.  The documentation also describes L2 (core-level)
support, but that feature is not available in any existing hardware.
<p>
In a CAT-enabled processor, it is possible to set up one or more cache
bitmaps ("CBMs") describing the portion of the cache that may be used.  If,
on a particular CPU, the L3 cache is divided into 20 slices, then a CBM of
<tt>0xfffff</tt> describes the entire cache, while <tt>0xf8000</tt> and
<tt>0x7c00</tt> describe two disjoint regions, each covering 25% of the
cache.
<p>

The CBMs are kept in a small table, indexed by a "class of service ID" or
CLOSID.  The CLOSID will eventually control multiple resources (L2 cache,
for example, or something entirely different) but, in current processors,
it only selects the active CBM for the L3 cache.
At any given time, a specific CLOSID will be active in each CPU,
controlling which portion of the cache that CPU can make use of.  Each CPU
has its own set of CLOSIDs; they are not a system-wide resource.

<p>
Kernel support is needed to make proper use of the CAT functionality.  The
number of CLOSIDs available is relatively small, so the kernel must
arbitrate access to them.  Like any resource-allocation technology, CAT
control must be limited to privileged users or it will be circumvented.  Yu
described how CAT policies can be controlled via the interfaces implemented
in the current patch set but, before getting into that, it's worthwhile to
step away from the talk for a moment and look at the history of this
interface.
<p>
<h4>Unsuccessful kittens</h4>
<p>
New hardware features often present interesting problems when the time
comes to add support to the kernel.  It is relatively easy to add that
support as a simple wrapper and access-control layer around the feature,
but care must be taken to avoid tying the interface to the hardware
itself.  A vendor's idea of how the feature should work can change over
time, and other manufacturers may have ideas of their own.  Any interface
that is unable to evolve with the hardware will become unsupportable over
time and have to be replaced.  So it is important to provide an interface
that abstracts away the details of how the hardware works to the greatest
extent possible.  At the same time, though, the interface cannot be so
abstract that it makes some important functionality unavailable.
<p>
The first public attempt at CAT support in the kernel appears to be <a
href="/Articles/622893/">this patch set</a> posted by Vikas Shivappa in
late 2014.  The approach taken was to use the control-group mechanism to
set the CBM for groups of processes; the CLOSID mechanism was hidden by the
kernel and not visible to user space at all.  The initial review discussion
focused on some of the more glaring deficiencies in the patch set, so it
took a while before developers started to point out that, perhaps, control
groups were not the right solution to this problem; it seems that they
abstracted things a little too much.
<p>
There were a few complaints about the control-group interface, but by far
the loudest was that it failed to reflect the fact that CAT works on a
per-CPU basis — each processor has its own set of CLOSIDs and its own
active policy at any given time.  The proposed interface was tied to
processes rather than processors, and it forced the use of a single policy
across the entire system.  There are plenty of real-world use cases that
want to have different cache-utilization policies on different CPUs in the
same system, but the control-group mechanism could not express those
policies.  This problem was exacerbated by the fact that the number of
CLOSIDs is severely limited; making it impossible for each CPU to use its
own CLOSID-to-CBM mappings made that limitation much more painful.
<p>
Beyond setting up different policies on different CPUs, many users would
like to use the CPU as the primary determinant for cache policy.  For
example, a specific CPU running an important task could be given exclusive
access to a large portion of the cache.  If the task in question is bound
to that processor, it will automatically get access to that cache
reservation; any related processes — kernel threads performing work related
to that task, for example — will also be able to use that cache space.
This mode, too, is not well supported by an interface based on control
groups.  In its absence, users would have to track down each helper process
and manually add it to the correct control group, a tedious and error-prone
task. 
<p>
The problem was discussed repeatedly as new versions of the patch set came
out during much of early 2015.  At one point, Marcelo Tosatti posted <a
href="/Articles/694805/">an interface based on <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls</a>
that was meant to address some of the concerns,
but it seems there was little interest in bringing <tt>ioctl()</tt> into
the mix.  In November, Thomas Gleixner posted <a href="/Articles/694806/">a
description of how he thought the interface should work</a> for discussion.
He said that a single, system-wide configuration was not workable and that
"<q>we need to expose this very close to the hardware implementation as
there are really no abstractions which allow us to express the various
bitmap combinations</q>"  His overall suggestion was to create a new
virtual filesystem for the control of the CAT mechanism; that is the
approach taken by Yu's current patch set.
<p>
<h4>Herding the CAT</h4>
<p>
Returning to Yu's talk: he noted that <a href="/Articles/694387/">a new
patch set</a> had been posted just prior to the conference; it shows the
implementation of the new control interface.  It is all based on a virtual
filesystem, as Gleixner had suggested.  Naturally enough, the name of that
filesystem (<tt>/sys/fs/rscctrl</tt>) became the first topic of debate,
with Gleixner <a href="/Articles/694867/">complaining</a> that it was too
cryptic.  Tony Luck's <a href="/Articles/694869/">suggestion</a> that it
could instead be called:
<p>
<pre>
    /sys/fs/Intel(R) Resource Director Technology(TM)/
</pre>
<p>
seems unlikely to be adopted; "<tt>/sys/fs/resctrl</tt>" may emerge as the
most acceptable name in the end.
<p>
The top level of this filesystem contains three files: <tt>tasks</tt>,
<tt>cpus</tt>, and <tt>schemas</tt>.  The <tt>tasks</tt> file contains a
list of all processes whose cache access is controlled by the bitmap found
in the <tt>schemas</tt> file; similarly, <tt>cpus</tt> can be used to
attach a bitmap to one or more CPUs.  Initially the <tt>tasks</tt> file
holds the IDs for all processes in the system, and <tt>cpus</tt> is all
zeroes; the <tt>schemas</tt> file contains all ones.  The default policy,
thus, is to allow all processes in the system the full use of the cache.
<p>
Normal usage will involve the system administrator creating subdirectories
to create new policies; each subdirectory will contain the same set of
three files.  A different CBM can be written to the <tt>schemas</tt> file
in the subdirectory, changing the cache-access policy for any affected
process.  A process can be tied to that new policy by writing its ID to the
<tt>tasks</tt> file.  It is also possible to tie the policy to one or more
CPUs by writing a CPU mask to the <tt>cpus</tt> file.  A CPU-based policy
will override a process-ID-based one — if a process is running on a CPU
with a specific policy, that is the policy that will be used regardless of
whether the process has been explicitly set to use a different one.
<p>
Yu's talk glossed over a number of details on exactly how these control
files work, as one might expect; <a href="/Articles/694870/">the
documentation file</a> from the patch set contains those details and some
usage examples as well.  He did discuss some benchmark results (which can
be seen at the end of <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/cat8.pdf">his
slides [PDF]</a>) showing
significant improvements for specific workloads that were affected by heavy
cache contention.  This feature may not be needed by everybody, but it
seems that some users will have a lot to gain from it.  Realtime workloads,
in particular, would appear to stand to benefit from dedicated cache space.
<p>
As for where things stand: the current patch set is out for review, with
the hope that the most significant obstacles have been overcome at this
point.  Assuming that the user-space interface issues have now been
resolved, this code, which has been under development for well over a year,
should be getting close to being ready for merging into the mainline.

To me the most important thing about this hardware feature is that it could be used to block cache-snooping attacks launched by untrusted code, e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07373v2.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07373v2.pdf</a>. I guess this interface can be used to do that --- reserving cache slices for untrusted code by removing them from the root 'schemas' file and assigning them to some specific low-trust tasks via a subdirectory.<br>
<p>
It would be nice to also be able to flush specific slices on a context switch to insulate different low-trust tasks from each other.<br>

And probably the TLBs too - I don't see why the cache attacks couldn't be adapted to run on them (albeit with 4KB resolution rather than 64B, and I think TLBs aren't shared between cores so it could only spy on other threads if they were running on the same core with hyperthreading).<br>
<p>
Incidentally, rather than relying on JS, I wonder if you could do these L3 cache attacks using WebGL, given that Intel GPUs share the CPU's L3/LLC? I think it might be relatively straightforward if they supported GLES 3.1 functionality - write a compute shader that runs N threads each looping over 1/N of a cache-sized buffer (with large N to maximise bandwidth utilisation and improve the attack's temporal resolution), and measure the latency of each access by reading a global counter that's atomically incremented in a tight loop by another thread. Not sure if it's possible to do something equivalent with GLES 2.0/3.0 features though, since I can't see how to measure latency in them.<br>

They won't stop at simple cache partitioning tho. As I pointed out during the session concerned, all Intel are doing here is exposing the underlying cache slices already on the SoC. What they wouldn't go into during the session is the something they indirectly highlighted in the metrics presented: there's an obvious next step beyond the cache that is needed to do this right. Anyone paying attention will see it, not everyone will then realize what should actually be done. Obviously Intel did, since my question leading in that direction was deflected with "I am not authorized to answer that", which was all I wanted to know at the time.<br>

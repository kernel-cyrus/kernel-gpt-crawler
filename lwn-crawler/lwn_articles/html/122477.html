<h1>Audio latency goes full circle</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 8, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/120797/">Two weeks ago</a>, it appeared
that a solution to the problem of low-latency scheduling for audio
applications had been found.  Ingo Molnar's approach, which allowed
unprivileged processes to use the realtime scheduling modes as long as they
did not use more than an administrator-specified portion of the available
CPU time, seemed like a reasonably straightforward way to go.  Ingo's patch
had gone into the -mm tree for further testing.
<p>

The rlimit approach keeps a rogue process from taking over the system
entirely.  It does not, however, prevent abuse by poorly-behaved software.
If even limited access to realtime scheduling became widely available on
Linux systems, it would only be a matter of time until developers figured
out that they could make their programs seem faster by using the realtime
mode.  Proprietary applications could be particularly problematic in this
regard; distributors would likely rip out unwarranted realtime scheduling
calls in free software that they ship, but that cannot be done with
proprietary code.
<p>

Other concerns with the rlimit approach include the need for some audio
applications to get fast access to the CPU even if they require 100% of the
available time, and general unease with tweaking the scheduler for this
use.  The end result is that the rlimit patch has come back out of -mm, and
Ingo has <a href="/Articles/122478/">said</a>:

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	i'm not opposed to the LSM solution per se, especially given that
	none of the other solutions in existence are fully satisfactory
	(and thus acceptable for the scheduler currently). The LSM patch is
	clearly the least intrusive solution.
</div>
<p>
Those who have been following the discussion will remember that the whole
long thing began because certain kernel developers did not feel that the
realtime security module (which gives members of an administrator-specified
group access to realtime scheduling) was acceptable for inclusion.  So the
discussion has come back to where it started, and it appears that the
realtime security module will be merged (though that had not happened as of
this writing).  Ingo <a href="/Articles/122479/">apologized</a> for the
whole thing, explaining it this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	it is just an unfortunate situation that the issue here is _not_
	clear-cut at all. It is a longstanding habit on lkml to try to
	solve things as cleanly and generally as possible, but there are
	occasional cases where this is just not possible.
</div>
<p>

One remaining problem with the realtime security module is that it gives
audio users the right to monopolize the processor with any program they
run, not just audio utilities.  Making the audio programs run in a setgid
mode might seem like a way around that issue, except for the fact that the
GTK+ toolkit <a href="/Articles/122481/">actively prevents</a> things from
working that way.  The unfortunate result is that users must be given more
privilege than they actually need.  Most of the time, that should be
acceptable; multi-user audio workstations are likely to be relatively
rare.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is true.  But in attempt to have things just work out of the box, I <br>
bet that Fedora, SuSE, etc. will default to users being members of the <br>
audio group.  AFAICT, either you will have to change that behaviour and so <br>
confuse new admins, or else users will have these elevated priveleges on <br>
all workstations. <br>

      So they're not requiring setgid just because some wrong-headed (to use their words) userspace library breaks on it?   What happened to the kernel developers' attitude of making it *right*, not politically expedient?<br>
<p>
If GTK+ breaks on setgid, fix GTK+.  It's not like that deliberate breakage really solves a security problem, as the linked message notes.  If GTK+ has other security problems because of this, fix *them*.<br>

      Gtk doesn't "break" with setgid.  It refuses to run with more priviledges <br>
by design (to prevent ignorant users from breaking their security).  You <br>
cannot have secure UI libraries, they are just too large and complex (I <br>
think Gtk is some 500 KLOCs) and rely on too many external libraries. <br>
 <br>
Gtk loads following kinds of plugins dynamically at run-time: <br>
- input methods <br>
- text layout engines <br>
- image loaders <br>
- theme-engines <br>
E.g. theme engines are specified in theme rc files and which rc file is <br>
loaded can be specified with an environment variable. <br>
 <br>
As another commentor mentioned, the normal practice for things requiring <br>
more priviledges is to do them in a separate process. <br>
 <br>
Secure programs should: <br>
- Not have any extra or dynamic dependencies <br>
- Do only one thing and do it well so that they are as small / clean as <br>
possible (= easy to audit) <br>
 <br>

      The solution here is disturbingly simple: Split the GUI and audio parts into separate processes, and give only the audio processes the extre permissions.  You can do this by using a helper app,
JUST as the GTK+ error message says.  The GUI part doesn't need the extra privs, only the audio part does, so give only the audio part the extra privs.

      What Jack O'Quin is suggesting is security through wishful thinking.<br>
Either you trust your users to responsibly use real-time scheduling<br>
or you don't. If you do, the supplementary groups approach is <br>
exactly right. If you don't, then you must restrict the capability<br>
using secure, verifiable means.<br>
<p>
No approach that involves making well over a million lines of<br>
library code setgid (your app, the toolkit, font handling, Xlib, theme <br>
engines, input methods, etc, etc.) is ever going to meet those <br>
requirements.<br>
<p>
Many of the developments in Linux security recently - whether it<br>
be SELinux, exec-shield, or whatever are about providing mechanisms<br>
that reduce the amount of code that could conceivably cause problems.<br>

      To follow up to myself, one thing I didn't address:<br>
 <br>
 "Why should it be OK to run GTK as `root', but not as setgid `audio'?"<br>
<p>
If you are running a GTK+ program setgid 'audio', then you are <br>
verifiably doing something stupid. If you are running a GTK+ program<br>
as root, you are probably doing so because you, as the user have<br>
root privileges. Now, you could also be running the GTK+ program <br>
as root because someone configured sudo to allow you to do that. <br>
While that is also not a secure configuration, there's no way to <br>
detect it, so we don't.<br>
<p>
Just because we can't catch all problems doesn't mean that we <br>
shouldn't catch the ones that we can. If you are determined you<br>
can work around the GTK+ checks. But at least you have to think<br>
about the issues involved.<br>

      I don't understand why universal access to limited real time features would be harmfull on a desktop system.  If most systems allowed real-time processes to consume at most 20% of the cpu, trying to get more cpu time by using real time mode would result in the program getting less cpu time.  20% should be enough to run normal applications like an audio player, a hardware accelerated pvr application, or a basic sound recorder.  <br>
<p>
I don't understand how the possibility that an application could hog 20% of the cpu could be a security violation on a desktop machine.  If a normal user dislikes a Free or proprietary application hogging their cpu, they don't edit the source and recompile it -- they uninstall it.  <br>
<p>

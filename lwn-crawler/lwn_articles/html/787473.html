           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 6, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
The performance of the <tt>fget()</tt> function in the kernel was the topic
of a discussion led by Dave Watson at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/file.c#L709"><tt>fget()</tt></a>
 is used to take a reference to a
file (i.e. bump a reference count), based on its file descriptor, and to
return the <tt>struct file</tt> pointer for it; references are dropped with
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/file_table.c#L329"><tt>fput()</tt></a>. 
Some recent profiling at Watson's
employer, Facebook, found the function to be taking a sizable portion of
the CPU time for some applications, so he wanted to talk about some of the
things he has tried to make that situation better.  
</p>

<p>
Watson found that <tt>fget()</tt> and <tt>fput()</tt> were taking up to nearly
3% of the CPU for some services that Facebook runs.  The worst was 2.9% for
an internal service, but the <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>
distributed key-value store was at 2% and <a
href="https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter">mcrouter</a>, which is used to
scale Memcached, was at 1.7%.  Various other services ranged from 0.3% to 0.9%.
</p>

<p>
His first thought was that taking up so much CPU simply to manage the
reference count is excessive.  But he noticed that
the services that seemed most affected were networking services, so he guessed that
something in the network stack might be causing this.  He focused on
Memcached and found that 72.5% of the CPU used by
<tt>fget()</tt> and <tt>fput()</tt> was coming from the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recv.2.html"><tt>recvfrom()</tt></a> 
system call.  The other two system calls that used significant amounts of
CPU time were <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html"><tt>epoll_pwait()</tt></a> 
at 11.5% and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/send.2.html"><tt>sendmsg()</tt></a> at 11%.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/787510/">

alt="[Dave Watson]" title="Dave Watson" width=217 height=300>
</a>

<p>
He noted that Memcached is a call-response service; it receives a
request for a key's value and sends it back.  So <tt>sendmsg()</tt> is
being called as often as <tt>recvfrom()</tt> but is contributing much less
to the problem.  His suspicion is that the receive path is taking a bunch
of cache misses, but that the send comes relatively soon after it, so the
cache will have fewer misses.
</p>

<p>
He then annotated <tt>fget()</tt> and found that cache misses on the
file-descriptor table and on dereferencing the <tt>struct file</tt> pointer
were taking up much of the CPU time, as does the atomic increment for the
reference count.  So he tried two different ways to reduce that overhead.
</p>

<p>
The first was to delay the reclamation of the <tt>struct file</tt> pointer
by not
incrementing the reference count in <tt>fget()</tt> (and not decrementing
it in <tt>fput()</tt>)
for some system calls that use a single file descriptor
(e.g. <tt>recvfrom()</tt>, <tt>sendmsg()</tt>, various <tt>epoll*()</tt>
calls, etc.).  The calls are not likely to block, but if they do,  the
behavior reverts to the existing path.  He worked up a proof of concept for
this idea, but the results were underwhelming,
so he does not recommend going down
that path.
</p>

<p>
His second attempt tried to get at the cache misses that were causing much
of the CPU use by creating a cache of <tt>struct file</tt> pointers on a
per-task basis.
Multiple file pointers in the file-descriptor table are sharing the same cache line, when
any of those get changed, even by an unrelated thread, there is cache-line
bouncing. 
For Facebook, the file descriptors stay with the same
thread once the "accepter" thread hands them off to a processing thread, so
the cache eliminates the processor cache misses and the performance loss
that went along with them.
It is not a fancy cache as, once again, he just wanted to see if it
helped.  There is a complication, however, as it is not clear how to flush
the cache, he said; if you want <tt>close()</tt> to work, though, you need
to flush the cache.  He ended up adding a field in <tt>struct file</tt>
that pointed at the cache entry so that <tt>close()</tt> could do the right thing.
</p>

<p>
Overall, his proof-of-concept seems to work well.  Most of the overhead
from cache misses for the file-descriptor table are gone; that gives a
roughly 2x
performance increase.  He has not thought about handling the cache misses
for the <tt>struct file</tt> pointer dereferencing, but that could be next.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara wondered if the file-descriptor table bouncing could be handled by
allocating file descriptors in a way that causes separate threads to use
different parts of the table.  Some applications may depend on sequential
file-descriptor allocation, however, which may not mesh well.  It would
potentially stop the cache-line bouncing of the table, though.  Matthew
Wilcox suggested that the scheme could be prototyped using <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup2.2.html"><tt>dup2()</tt></a>. 
</p>

<p>
Wilcox also suggested that moving to a process-based, rather than
thread-based, model for these services would be another way to avoid some
of the problems that Facebook is experiencing.  Watson said that would
essentially be impossible.  The idea of a per-thread file-descriptor range
is worth experimenting with, however.

One complication is that often one thread accepts, but then is load balanced to another thread for most of its lifetime. So it may be necessary to somehow specify or change the fd range at a time later than accept() or open(). <br>

I'd suggest that the only tasks where sequential allocation matters is when you close fd 0…2 right before dup()ing, and even that is highly unreliable in a threaded environment (thread 1 closes stdout, thread 2 calls accept(), thread 1 dup()s … oops – should have used dup2() …).<br>
<p>
Thus, sequential allocation doesn't need a flag or its absence, it only needs to check that the refcount of the fd table is ==1.<br>

It is mandated POSIX behaviour though, so we usually like to have a way for applications to opt-in to non-POSIX behaviour, be it a prctl, an fcntl or something else.<br>

Let's see what the dup2() experiment buys us, then we can discuss how to implement it (if it is a win)<br>

Instead of using non-sequential fds, how about indexing the table differently by shuffling the bits of the fd around before using it as an index, so that sequential fds don't share a cacheline?<br>

Nice idea.  Unfortunately, the problem is not that fds are assigned to threads in some kind of round-robin order.  They're assigned to threads in a semi-random order in an attempt to keep worker threads equally busy.  Adding in a shuffle isn't going to help.<br>

As usual, there's no need to break working code. Threads of control may run in a shared address space without sharing a file descriptor table. Granted, this means explicit file descriptor passing would have to be used to bounce jobs among threads for the joy of delay but as people who do that obviously don't have any performance requirements (the c10k page is really old by now), this shouldn't matter.<br>

With io_uring, you can skip the fget call by using a 'fixed' reference. There should be a patch coming soon to add sendmsg()+recvmsg() support to io_uring.<br>

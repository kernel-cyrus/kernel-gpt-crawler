           </div>
Reference counts are used throughout the kernel to track the lifecycles of
objects; when a reference count is decremented to zero, the kernel knows
that the associated object is no longer in use and can be freed.  But
reference counts, like almost any other mechanism, are subject to various
sorts of bugs in their usage, and those bugs can lead to exploitable
vulnerabilities.  So it is not surprising that developers have been
interested in hardening the kernel against such bugs for years.
<p>
With reference counts, the most common bugs are failure to decrement a
counter and decrementing the counter when a reference is not held.  Both
often happen in error paths and can go undetected for a long time, since
those paths are lightly tested at best and rarely executed.  An error
situation might lead a function to return without performing a necessary
decrement, or it may decrement a count that, in fact, had not yet been
incremented.  But these bugs can pop up in non-error paths as well; they
often go unnoticed, since they rarely result in obvious explosions.
<p>
Excessive decrements will cause an object to be freed before the last real
reference has been released, leading to a classic use-after-free
situation.  Such errors are often exploitable; see <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4557">CVE-2016-4557</a>
(and <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8358b02bf67d3a5d8a825070e1aa73f25fb2e4c7">the
associated fix</a>) for a recent example.  Excessive increments, if they can be
provoked by an attacker, lead to a similar scenario: first the counter is
overflowed, then decremented back to zero, leading to a premature freeing
of the object.  <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0728">CVE-2016-0728</a>
(fixed with <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/38bd10c447f8e8980753149a8a65108159871df5">this
commit</a>) is an example of the trouble that can ensue.  Needless to say,
it would be 
nice to catch this type of error before it gets to the point of being
exploitable by an attacker.
<p>
As is so often the case, the oldest work in this area seems to have been
done in the <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">PaX</a> project.  This
work starts with the kernel's <tt>atomic_t</tt> type, which is often used
to implement reference counts.  The kernel provides a set of helper
functions for performing operations (increments and decrements, for
example) on <tt>atomic_t</tt> variables, so it makes sense to add overflow
checks to those functions.  That must be done carefully, though, since
operations on <tt>atomic_t</tt> variables are often in hot paths in the
kernel; changes that increase the size of the <tt>atomic_t</tt> type are
also unlikely to be accepted.
<p>
In the PaX case, the relevant operations, most of which are already
implemented in assembly, are enhanced to perform overflow checks.  Often
that is just a matter of checking the condition-code flags set by the
processor as a result of the increment or decrement operation.  Should an
overflow be 
detected, the response is architecture-dependent, but results in some sort
of kernel trap.  The overflow is undone, the process that overflowed the
counter is killed, and a message is logged.
<p>
This checking catches attempts to exploit the overflow (excessive
increment) bugs handily; that class of bugs is rendered unexploitable.
Excessive decrements are harder to catch, since decrementing a reference
count to zero is a part of normal operation.  If such a bug exists, though,
it will almost certainly show itself by decrementing the counter below zero
occasionally, even in normal operations.  With checking in place, somebody
should notice the problem and it should be fixed.
<p>
There is one catch that makes this patch more invasive than one might
expect, though: not all uses of <tt>atomic_t</tt> are reference counts.
Other uses, which might legitimately wrap or go below zero, should not have
this type of checking enabled.  To get to 
that point, PaX adds <tt>atomic_unchecked_t</tt> type and converts a large
set of in-kernel users; that leads to a fair amount of code churn.
<p>
Back in December, David Windsor <a href="/Articles/668876/">posted a
version</a> of the PaX reference-count hardening patch set for review.  A
certain amount of discussion followed, and some problems were pointed out,
but there was little opposition to the idea in general.  Unfortunately,
David vanished shortly thereafter and never followed up with a new version
of the patches, so they remain outside of the mainline.  Nobody else has
stepped up to carry this work forward.
<p>
More recently, Jann Horn has posted <a href="/Articles/692695/">a different
approach</a> to the refcount problem.  Rather than change the
<tt>atomic_t</tt> type, this patch set changes the <a
href="/Articles/75920/"><tt>kref</tt> mechanism</a>, which exists
explicitly for the implementation of reference counts.  This choice means
that far fewer locations in the kernel will be protected, but it makes the
patch set far less invasive and allows testing of the underlying ideas.
<p>
Jann's patch set eschews assembly tweaks in favor of entirely
architecture-independent checking, a choice which, he later <a
href="/Articles/693039/">conceded</a>, might not be the most efficient in
the end. 
With this patch in place, special things happen once a reference count
reaches a maximum value (0x70000000): after that point, increments and
decrements are no longer allowed.  In essence, a reference count that large
is deemed to have already overflowed, so it is "pinned" at a high number to
prevent premature object freeing.  No warnings are emitted, and no
processes are killed.
<p>
While he had no objection to the patch as it was, Kees Cook <a
href="/Articles/693040/">said</a> that he would rather see the checking
done at the <tt>atomic_t</tt> level, since so much reference counting is
done that way.  Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/693042/">agreed</a>,
noting that the process of auditing <tt>atomic_t</tt> users would turn up a
lot of places where <tt>kref</tt> should be used instead.  Adding overflow
checking to <tt>atomic_t</tt> would protect <tt>kref</tt> automatically
(since <tt>kref</tt>s are implemented as a wrapper around
<tt>atomic_t</tt>), so it really 
does seem that, despite the large number of changes required, this
protection should be done at the lower level.
<p>
Of course, there is already a working patch set for the detection of
<tt>atomic_t</tt> overflows: the PaX code.  The work to separate it out and
turn it into a standalone kernel patch has even been done.  The flag-day
nature of the change (all non-reference-count uses of <tt>atomic_t</tt>
have to change when the semantics of <tt>atomic_t</tt> do) is will make
the process of upstreaming this patch a bit harder, but such changes can be
made when they are justified.  Closing off a class of errors that has
demonstrably led to exploitable kernel vulnerabilities would seem like a
reasonably strong justification.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I don't see how C++ isn't way better in that respect. Smart pointers are designed specifically to address the issue of missing/superfluous decrements.<br>

It is better, but not way better. There are hundreds of ways to shoot yourself in the foot in C++, like dereferencing a null pointer or reading free memory, which are statically checked by the compiler in Rust.<br>
But the kernel isn't written in Rust nor in C++, so the point is moot.<br>

I have some out-of-tree kernel code that increments an atomic_t to assign a 32-bit unsigned tag to an object, and overflow after a few billion tags is perfectly fine.  But I recently enabled UBSAN, and it complains because atomic_t is signed, and signed overflow is undefined behavior in C, even though I am using the result as unsigned.  The kernel does not provide an unsigned atomic_t type.  Time to use C11 atomics instead?<br>

Last time I looked, every time you opened one of those files in /proc/net, the reference count for the network namespace was incremented. Then, when closing the file, it was decremented again. So, if you can open a lot of files, you can ostensibly make that reference counter wrap, and then have a nice use-after-free vuln. Exploitation isn't that hard. The last time I was playing with this, my choice for getting past rlimit on max open files was to make a unix socket, send the fd over that socket, but not recv it on the other end, and then close it on the sending end. Then, it wouldn't count toward the rlimit, and it wouldn't be closed either. It's been a little while since I looked at that code, so I'm not sure how much of the above has been patched. But, anyway, obvious security problem with those reference counters.<br>

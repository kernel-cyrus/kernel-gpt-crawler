A processor's translation lookaside buffer (TLB) caches the mappings from
virtual to physical addresses.  Looking up virtual addresses is expensive,
so good performance often depends on making the best use of the TLB.  In
the memory-management track of the 2017 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, Mike Kravetz described a SPARC processor feature
that can improve TLB performance and explored ways in which that feature
could be supported.
<p>
On most processors, context switches between processes are expensive
operation because they force the contents of the TLB to be flushed.  SPARC
differs, though, in that TLB entries carry a tag associating them with a
specific context.  Since the processor knows to ignore TLB entries that do
not correspond to the process that is executing, there is no need to flush
the TLB on context switches.  That takes away much of the context-switch
penalty, and, as a result, improves performance.
<p>
The SPARC context register has been supported in Linux for a long time.
But, Kravetz said, recent SPARC processors have added a second register,
meaning that any given process can be associated with two independent
contexts at the same time.  Kravetz, an Oracle employee, said that this

<a href="/Articles/718209/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/lsfmm/MikeKravetz-sm.jpg" alt="[Mike Kravetz]"
title="Mike Kravetz" class="lthumb"></a>

helps these processors support "the most important application in the
world" — the Oracle database — which is built around a set of processes
working on a large shared-memory area.  If the second context ID is
assigned to that area, then the associated TLB entries can be shared across
all of those processes.
<p>
He has posted <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/12/16/508">a patch
set</a> allowing this register to be used for shared-memory areas.  The
patch is "80% SPARC code", though, so nobody but Dave Miller (the SPARC
maintainer) has looked at it, he said.  His hope was to draw more attention
to this feature and work out the best way to expose the functionality of
this second context ID to user space.
<p>
His thinking is to have a special virtual memory area (VMA) flag to
indicate a memory region with a shared context.  But that leaves the
question of how that flag should be set; Kirill Shutemov observed that it
could be difficult to provide a sane interface for this feature.  Kravetz's
proposal added a special flag to the <tt>mmap()</tt> and <tt>shmat()</tt>
system calls.  One nice feature of this approach is that it does not
require exposing the shared-context ID to user space.  Instead, the
kernel sees that the flag was set, assigns a context ID, and ensures that
all processes mapping the same area at the same virtual address use the
same context.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox suggested that perhaps <tt>madvise()</tt> would be a better
system call for this functionality.  The problem with <tt>madvise()</tt>,
Kravetz said, is that it creates an inherent race condition.  The shared
context ID is stored in the page-table entries, so it needs to be set up
before any of those entries are created.  In particular, it needs to be in
place before the process faults any of the pages in the shared region.
Otherwise, those prematurely faulted pages will not be associated with the
shared&nbsp;ID.
<p>
Kravetz's first patch set only supported pages mapped from <a
href="/Articles/374424/">hugetlbfs</a>, which 
was enough to cover the Oracle shared-memory area.  But he noted that it
would be nice to cover executable mappings as well.  While that would
enable the shared ID to be used with shared libraries; the more immediate
use case was the Oracle 
database executable, of course.  Dave Hansen reacted to this idea by
observing that Oracle seems to be trying to glue its multiprocess
implementation back into a single process.  (This feature, it should be
noted, would not play well with address-space layout randomization, since
all mappings must be to the same virtual address).
<p>
It was suggested that, in essence, hugetlbfs is a second memory-management
subsystem for the kernel, providing semantics that the original lacked.
DAX, perhaps, is developing into a third.  The shared-context flag is
needed because hugetlbfs is a second subystem; otherwise, things would be
shared more transparently.  So perhaps the real answer is to get rid of
hugetlbfs?  The problem with that idea, Andrea Arcangeli said, is that
hugetlbfs will always have a performance advantage over transparent huge
pages because the huge pages are reserved ahead of time.  There are not
many hugetlbfs users out there, but those few really want it.
<p>
Arcangeli went on to say that the real problem with TLB performance is that
Linux is still using small (4KB) pages; someday that page size is going to
have to increase.  Shutemov said that increase would be an ABI break, but
Arcangeli countered that, when the x86-64 port was done, care was taken to
not expose any boundaries smaller than 2MB to user space.  That takes care
of most potential ABI issues (on that architecture), but there are still
cases where user space sees the smaller page size — <tt>mprotect()</tt>
calls, for example.  So Linux will not be able to get completely away from
small pages anytime soon.
<p>
As the end of the session approached, Rik van Riel pulled the conversation
back to the main topic by asking if there were any action items.  It seems
that there are no known bugs in Kravetz's patch set, other than the fact
that it is limited to hugetlbfs, which ignores memory-allocation policies,
cpusets, and more.  Mel Gorman said that, since hugetlbfs is its own
memory-management subsystem, it can do what it wants in that area; Michal
Hocko suggested simply documenting the things that don't work properly.
The final question came from Hansen, who asked whether this feature was
really important or not.  The answer seems to be "yes, because Oracle wants
it".<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Probably a bit of offtopic, I want to ask nonetheless.<br>
<p>
Some time ago I thought about how can OSes use huge pages and global pages widely. My idea was to load all text sections and all read-only data sections into huge pages available to all processes at the same addresses.<br>
<p>
Pros are:<br>
+ These pages can be huge (reducing TLB overhead)<br>
+ These pages can be made global (reducing TLB overhead during process switching)<br>
− The first loading of a shared-object will be slow (we can not do lazy binding, because the shared area can not be made writeble by userspace processes)<br>
+ The second and next loadings of a shared-object will be instantaneous<br>
+ No GOT and PLT overhead (fast shared libraries)<br>
− Kernel needs to somehow arbitrate the process of loading and unloading shared-objects (implementation complexity), most likely kernel needs to be aware what shared libraries are loaded into which processes<br>
− ASLR doesn't work<br>
− Makes ROP easier (lots of code are loaded into each process)<br>
± Probably practical only on 64-bit systems where we have plenty of available virtual space<br>
<p>
So for me it sounds like we have better performance at expense of reduced exploit mitigation. What do others think? Do you think these trade-offs are reasonable? Or are my ideas completely crazy?<br>

Could we do this?  Sure.  AIX did something like it.<br>
<p>
Is it worth it?  Probably not.  For instance, we can't currently use large pages to map text (without app recompiling or using an LD_PRELOAD).  We also can't cross a VMA boundary with a single huge page.  Each shared library currently requires its own VMA (or set of them).  Some of the library is mapped read-only, and some of it is read-write and MAP_PRIVATE.  A huge page must be either r/w *or* r/o.<br>
<p>
You bring up a bunch of ways that things *could* be faster, but they are not currently large pain points for most applications.<br>

Quick aside: the ASID (and VMID) bits in various architectures can be extended beyond the cache tags to TLB tags and often are. Combined with hardware TLB invalidate broadcasts preventing IPI storms you actually get a lot of uplift on some non-crufty architectures.<br>
<p>
Also, it's worth noting that TLBs don't stand alone. And they vary in size. Every modern core actually has uTLBs closer to the translation engine and often has multiple configurable sized TLBs (cf AMD Zen for a public example).<br>

One other comment on this (and similar discussion)<br>
<p>
We live in a world where we have (arbitrarily, and with both actual malice and nonsense in mind) created stupid separations between "software" and "hardware" people and we go to great lengths to make sure they never, ever meet. Wouldn't it be better if we actually had VM folks and hardware designers meet at such gatherings, rather than the current approach in the industry of "build every kind of hardware software might later want to use". Today's approach is too abstracted. Abstractions are great. We should, however, have smart people get together and discuss ways we could evolve technology in a cohesive fashion over time.<br>
<p>
Or, we can continue in the current world. Certain large chip companies can shove things out at us and handle all of the lifting. But the result might not be as good as it could be if people talked. I'm speaking here of traditional legacy architectures, not necessarily what some of the emerging ones might be doing to address these kinds of problems through collaboration. But folks with x86 laptops and desktops have certain clear vendors in mind today.<br>

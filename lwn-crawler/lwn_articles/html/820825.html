The kernel's CPU scheduler does its best to make the right decisions for
just about any workload; over the years, it has been extended to better
handle mobile-device scheduling as well.  But handset vendors still end up
applying their own patches to the scheduler for the kernels they ship.
Shipping out-of-tree code in this way leads to a certain amount of
criticism from the kernel community but, as
Vincent Donnefort pointed out in his session at the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), those patches are applied for a
reason.  He looked at a set of vendor scheduler patches to see why they are
being used.
<p>
As a testbed for these patches, Donnefort chose the Pixel 4 phone.  It's a
device with good upstream support, so it's easy to replace its kernel

<a href="/Articles/820827/"><img

Donnefort]" title="Vincent Donnefort" class="lthumb"></a>

without the need for lots of other out-of-tree code.  This device has three
different CPU core sizes, small, medium, and 
large, where the small cores are small indeed.  It is imperative to pick
the correct CPU for any given task, or there will be a cost to pay in
performance or energy use.  The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCMark">PCMark</a> benchmark was used
to evaluate performance, while power measurement was done directly from the
phone's power rails.  A 4.14 kernel was used for the tests.
<p>
The first patch tested performs CPU isolation by actively evacuating tasks
to other CPUs; the intent is to idle the CPU and let it be put into a sleep
state.  Tasks are migrated, interrupts are directed elsewhere, and the CPU
is removed from the load balancer's attention entirely; kernel threads
attached to that CPU still run, though.  This is, he said, a sort of
lightweight form of CPU hotplug.
<p>
This patch works by looking at the load presented by all of the running
tasks and calculating how much CPU power is needed.  If the number of
running CPUs exceeds what is needed, it will try to isolate one or more of
them.  This decision is made in user space.
<p>
In performance testing, Donnefort found that CPU isolation reduces
throughput slightly, but also gives a 4% drop in power consumption.
Vincent Guittot asked why the energy model built into the kernel couldn't
handle this task; Donnefort responded that he didn't try to evaluate
alternative solutions to the problem.  The results show, though, that there
is room for improvement.
<p>
The other patches were presented as a set.  They were:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> "Migration margins": this patch changes the way the kernel picks
     a CPU for a task on an asymmetric system.  This is done by comparing
     the task's expected utilization with the capacity of the CPU; the
     mainline kernel will only place a task on a CPU if there will be 20%
     of its capacity left afterward.  The vendor patch lowers this margin
     to&nbsp;5%, thus increasing the chance that a given task will end up
     on a smaller, more energy-efficient CPU.
<li> There is a change to how the scheduler does task packing.  The
     mainline tries to keep tasks contained within a single cluster (thus
     possibly allowing other clusters to go idle), but will try to spread
     out tasks      across 
     the CPUs in a cluster.  The vendor patch, instead, works harder to
     pack tasks into a single CPU, though stopping before it would become
     necessary to increase the CPU's frequency.
<li> The mainline puts some effort into finding the most efficient CPU to
     run any given task on â€” too much time, it seems, for some vendors, who
     make a change to that algorithm.  With this change, the kernel decides
     where to put a task by first looking at where it was running last
     time; if that CPU is idle and the task fits there, the placement logic
     will be shorted out and that CPU will be chosen immediately.  He noted
     that energy-aware task placement has improved considerably since the
     release of the 4.14 kernel used for these tests.
<li> When placing a realtime task, the kernel performs a search for the CPU
     that is running the lowest-priority task; that will be the easiest one
     to preempt.  The vendor patch expands this search to look at
     utilization and idle states as well, trying to find the CPU that is
     the least busy overall.  The search is also biased toward finding the
     smallest suitable CPU.
</ul>
<p>
The benchmark results for each of these patches were remarkably similar.
They all tended to hurt performance by 3-5% while reducing energy use by
8-11%.  What Donnefort did not do, though, was to benchmark a system with
all of them applied; he cautioned against assuming that those differences
would be additive with all of the patches in the system.
<p>
He concluded with the simple assertion that, even if some of these changes
are controversial, they are clearly useful in this setting.  He will be
looking at ways of getting those changes into an acceptable form for
merging upstream.
<p>
In the discussion, Qais Youssef said that some of his recent CPU-capacity
changes might be able to replace some of this work.  Dietmar Eggemann asked
why the energy model wasn't providing CPU isolation now; it should already
be pushing things aggressively toward small CPUs.  Peter Zijlstra agreed
that it was important to figure out why that workaround was necessary;
perhaps the scheduler should look more closely at idle states in the
energy-aware path.  Donnefort said that CPU isolation in this form is
probably not the right solution for the mainline kernel, but it does show
that there is something to be gained that way.

<p>
This should be coming to an end with Google moving to requiring a single (Google) kernel + vendor modules.<br>
<p>
Of course Google could still apply out of tree patches to their kernel but at least that will mean just a single place to look at to figure out how the mainline scheduler could be improved for the Android use case.<br>

<h1>Workqueues get a rework</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted November 27, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/23634/">workqueue mechanism</a> allows
kernel code to defer processing to a later time.  Workqueues are
characterized by the existence of one or more dedicated processes which
execute queued jobs; since work is done in process context, it can sleep if
need be.  Workqueues can also delay the execution of specific jobs for a
caller-specified period.  They are used in many places throughout the
kernel.

<p>
David Howells recently took a look at workqueues and noticed that the
<tt>work_struct</tt> structure, which describes a task to be executed, is
rather large.  It can be 96 bytes on 64-bit machines.  That is fairly heavy
for structures which can be used in reasonably large quantities.  So he set
out to find ways to make it smaller.  He succeeded, but at the cost of some
changes to the workqueue API.
<p>

The causes of bloat in <tt>struct work_struct</tt> are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The timer structure embedded in each one.  Many users of workqueues 
     never need the delay feature, but every queued bit of work carries
     along a <tt>timer_list</tt> structure, just in case.
<p>
<li> The private data pointer, which is passed to the actual work
     function.  Many work functions use that pointer, but it can often be
     calculated from the <tt>work_struct</tt> pointer using
     <tt>container_of()</tt>. 
<p>
<li> An entire word is used to store a single bit: the "pending" flag which
     indicates that a <tt>work_struct</tt> is currently in a queue waiting
     to be executed.  
</ul>
<p>
David addressed each of these issues.  As a result, there are now two types
of work structure (<tt>struct work_struct</tt> and <tt>struct
delayed_work</tt>); the timer information has been removed from the
former.  The private data pointer is gone; work functions instead get a
pointer to the associated <tt>work_struct</tt> (or <tt>delayed_work</tt>)
structure.  And some internal trickery was used to get rid of the word
holding the "pending" bit.
<p>
The result of these changes is that almost every part of the workqueue API
has changed.  There are now two ways of declaring a workqueue entry:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef void (*work_func_t)(struct work_struct *work);

    DECLARE_WORK(name, func);
    DECLARE_DELAYED_WORK(name, func);
</pre>
<p>

The prototype for the work function has changed; it is now a pointer to the
relevant work queue entry.  Note that a <tt>work_struct</tt> pointer is
always passed, even in the case of delayed work.  It would appear that the
programmer is expected to count on the fact that <tt>struct
work_struct</tt> is the first field of <tt>struct delayed_work</tt>, so
<tt>container_of()</tt> should work as expected.  As long as nobody
rearranges <tt>struct delayed_work</tt>, anyway.
<p>
For work structures which must be set up at run time, the initialization
macros now look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    INIT_WORK(struct work_struct work, work_func_t func);
    PREPARE_WORK(struct work_struct work, work_func_t func);
    INIT_DELAYED_WORK(struct delayed_work work, work_func_t func);
    PREPARE_DELAYED_WORK(struct delayed_work work, work_func_t func);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>INIT_*</tt> versions initialize the entire structure; they must be
used the first time a structure is initialized.  Thereafter, the
<tt>PREPARE_*</tt> versions, which are slightly faster, can be used.
<p>
The functions for adding entries to workqueues (and canceling them) now
look like this: 
<p>
<pre>
    int queue_work(struct workqueue_struct *queue,
                   struct work_struct *work);
    int queue_delayed_work(struct workqueue_struct *queue,
                           struct delayed_work *work);
    int queue_delayed_work_on(int cpu,
                              struct workqueue_struct *queue,
                   	      struct delayed_work *work);
    int cancel_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *work);
    int cancel_rearming_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *work);
</pre>
<p>
Interestingly, David has added a variant on the workqueue declaration and
initialization macros:
<p>
<pre>
    DECLARE_WORK_NAR(name, func);
    DECLARE_DELAYED_WORK_NAR(name, func);
    INIT_WORK_NAR(name, func);
    INIT_DELAYED_WORK_NAR(name, func);
    PREPARE_WORK_NAR(name, func);
    PREPARE_DELAYED_WORK_NAR(name, func);
</pre>
<p>
The "NAR" stands for "non-auto-release."  Normally, the workqueue subsystem
resets a work entry's pending flag prior to calling the work function; that
action, among other things, allows the function to resubmit itself if need
be.  If the entry is initialized with one of the above macros, however,
this reset will not happen, and the work function is expected to reset the
flag itself (with a call to <tt>work_release()</tt>).  The stated purpose
is to prevent the workqueue entry from being released before the work
function is done with it - but there is nothing in the clearing of the
pending bit which would cause that release to happen.  Perhaps that is why
there are no users of the <tt>_NAR</tt> variants in David's patch.  It may
be that somebody is thinking about implementing reference-counted workqueue
structures in the future.
<p>

Meanwhile, these changes require a lot of fixes throughout the kernel tree;
that drew <a href="/Articles/211305/">a complaint</a> from Andrew Morton,
who was unable to make those changes mesh with all of the other patches
queued up for the opening of the 2.6.20 merge window.  Andrew suggested
that the workqueue patches could be merged after 2.6.20-rc1 comes out, as
was done with the interrupt handler function prototype in 2.6.19.  But
Linus, who likes the workqueue patches, <a href="/Articles/211306/">would
rather get them in sooner</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'd actually prefer to take it before -rc1, because I think the
	previous time we did something after -rc1 was a failure (the whole
	irq argument handling thing). It just exposed too many problems too
	late in the dev cycle. I'd rather have the problems be exposed by
	the time -rc1 rolls out, and keep the whole "we've done all major
	nasty ops by -rc1" thing.
</div>
<p>
So it seems that, somehow, all of the pieces will be made to fit and the
workqueue API will change in 2.6.20.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Ok, I know this won't be at the top of the list of "most important posts on LWN, ever", but anyway: In my native language, Danish, "nar" means "fool". So  "DECLARE_WORK_NAR" initially caught my eye and my coffeine-overloaded brain read it as "Declare a work fool?!" It's funny, it's so easy to use a spelling or abbreviation that's "interesting" in at least one other foreign language. Someone I know created an in-house tool with a name aimed at conveying "speed" to the users. Well, speed in Danish is "fart". Not good. Not good at all. :-)<br>

So that would be saving 8 * 8 = 64 bytes.<br>

      Yes, struct delayed_work and struct work_struct sucks. <br>
IMO it should be struct delayed_work_struct and struct work_struct or <br>
just struct delayed_work and struct work. <br>

      If I understand correctly, the workqueue API are very uncomfortable. If I queue_work the same task (function) that is already in the queue  with a different parameter (data), it is rejected, why is there not an API to queue a work that copies the structure instead of simply using its pointer? Or probably is better that the user kmalloc the work and then, when the work is completed, the work is freed. <br>

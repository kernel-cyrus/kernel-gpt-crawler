<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/990496/">Kangrejos 2024</a>

<p>
At Kangrejos, Gary Guo wanted to discuss three problems with the way
Rust and C code in the kernel interact: mismatched types, too many type casts,
and the overhead of helper functions. To fix the first two problems, Guo proposed
changing the way the kernel maps C types into Rust types. The last problem was a
bit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking
the compiler into inlining the helper functions across language boundaries.
</p>

<h4>Types</h4>

<p>
Currently, the Rust-for-Linux project
<a href="/Articles/992693/">
uses</a> bindgen to generate the bindings
between C code and Rust code. This works, but not all types can be translated
perfectly. Guo shared
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/2024/FFI%20types%20and%20helpers.pdf">
some slides</a> to illustrate the current state of translated
integers:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/guo-presentation.png" class="photo" border=0
alt="[A diagram showing the correspondence between C types and Rust types]">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, the mapping is platform-dependent and not one-to-one. This adds extra
complexity for anyone trying to write code in one language that talks to code in
the other language. Plus, some important types such as <tt>size_t</tt> and
<tt>uintptr_t</tt> are typedefs, and not actual types on the C side, which makes
the correspondence even less clear.
</p>

<p>
Carlos Bilbao asked why the translation couldn't take those typedefs into
account, and map Rust's <tt>isize</tt> and <tt>usize</tt> to whatever
<tt>size_t</tt> and <tt>uintptr_t</tt> resolve to. The problem is that bindgen
works by reading C headers, Guo explained; because of C's implicit
integer conversions, it is sometimes not clear whether a <tt>long</tt> in the C
sources should be an <tt>i64</tt> or an <tt>isize</tt> in the Rust code. The end
result of this confusion is a lot of unnecessary casts that obscure the
meaning of the code, he continued. Bindgen does have some special
support for <tt>size_t</tt>, however. Greg Kroah-Hartman pointed out that
the use of <tt>long</tt> in kernel C is deliberate
— there is no native kernel type that
corresponds to <tt>intptr_t</tt>. In fact, Linux requires that <tt>long</tt>
must be able to contain a pointer.
</p>

<p>
Intended or not, these problems mean that type casts are frequently required in
Rust code, since Rust does not have implicit integer conversions.
Sometimes clippy, Rust's linting tool, will complain about redundant casts
— but they aren't redundant on a different architecture, because
the mapping between types is not the same. Also, the differing type names can
cause problems for type tags for control-flow-integrity (CFI) protection — which work on the
actual types of function arguments, not their sizes. Finally, the kernel defines
<tt>char</tt> to be unconditionally unsigned, even on platforms where it is
normally signed. Rust's <tt>c_char</tt> type respects the architecture's
convention for the sign, so trying to use <tt>c_char</tt> to represent C
<tt>char</tt> values can cause sign problems.
</p>

<p>
Guo proposed adopting a custom, fixed mapping for bindgen in the kernel, to try
and alleviate some of these problems:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<a href="/Articles/993325">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/guo-presentation-2.png" class="photo" border=0
alt="[A different proposed mapping]">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
This change would not be a panacea — there are still a few edge cases. Among
other problems, this mapping would still not work for
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">
CHERI</a> systems. But overall,
having a mapping that is consistent across architectures should make thinking
about this code a lot less painful.
</p>

<p>
Kroah-Hartman did question the decision to map <tt>u8</tt> back to <tt>unsigned
char</tt>, instead of <tt>char</tt>, since the kernel defines <tt>char</tt> to
always be unsigned. Unfortunately, the C standard has some strange wording
around the different <tt>char</tt> types, and <tt>char</tt> and <tt>unsigned
char</tt> are still treated as different types (with slightly different
semantics) by the compiler, even when using <tt>-funsigned-char</tt>.
</p>

<h4>Helpers</h4>

<p>
The other problem Guo wanted to tackle was the inefficiencies caused by how the
Rust-for-Linux project wraps C macros and inline functions. Bindgen cannot directly
incorporate C macros into Rust code for obvious reasons. Instead, when Rust code
needs to use something defined as a macro in C, the programmer writes an
explicit wrapper function for it. The same workaround applies to inline
functions. This prevents duplicating macros in
both languages, but has a serious performance downside. Inline functions are often used
when an operation is so performance-sensitive that a single function call is too
much; so adding a helper function when calling them from Rust code is a problem.
</p>

<p>
Guo listed a few possible alternatives. One would be to change the policy against
reimplementing macros in Rust. This is unpopular with kernel maintainers, but
might be worth it for the most performance-sensitive cases. Another option to
explore could be transpiling C macros to Rust code using
<a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust">
c2rust</a>.
Unfortunately, c2rust is too big to include in the kernel repository,
not packaged by any distributions,
fragile, and requires nightly Rust. Guo doesn't believe that it's a reasonable option.
The last possibility he put forward was cross-language link-time optimization
(LTO). This would let the compiler automatically inline helper functions across
language boundaries at link time, drastically reducing the performance impact.
The downside is that LTO is slow, and sometimes breaks the kernel's build.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Hindborg suggested that it would be faster to just perform LTO on Rust
modules. Guo agreed, observing that the project did not actually need full LTO
in order to eliminate the overhead of the helpers — it would be sufficient to
just inline the helpers into Rust call sites. This would be similar to Rust's
default behavior for release builds, which uses
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html">
ThinLTO</a>.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate this idea, Guo put together a "<q>hack</q>". His idea was to use
Clang to compile
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11.2/source/rust/helpers.c">
helpers.c</a> into LLVM bytecode. Then, for each Rust crate, ask the compiler to
emit bytecode as well. Once everything is in the form of LLVM bytecode, it can
be fed back into Clang with LTO turned on to produce a combined object file with the
helpers inlined. It's not a guarantee, because Clang might choose not to perform
the inlining, but it should help with performance. Guo tried it with the
existing Rust kernel code, and found that this approach did produce valid object
files,
but the block layer revealed another problem.
</p>

<p>
The main problem with this approach is linking the resulting objects back into
the kernel. If the objects are linked as normal, there will be duplicate symbols
from the independent copies of each helper function. A potential solution would
be to use a different linkage. LLVM supports a nonstandard <tt>weak_odr</tt> linkage,
in order to correctly handle C++'s one-definition rule. But this type of linkage
can't currently be generated from C code. Paul McKenney asked whether it made
sense to try to compile the helpers file with C++, in that case. That would
require C++ support in the kernel, Guo pointed out.
</p>

<p>
He did have another workaround to try, however: textually manipulating the LLVM
bytecode file after it is generated to add the appropriate attribute. When he
tried that, however, LLVM no longer inlined the helpers. It turns out that LLVM
has two checks that can prevent it from inlining a function: a check that the
target attributes of both pieces of bytecode match, and that their
<tt>-fno-delete-null-pointer-check</tt> settings are the same. Guo proposed
passing a flag to LLVM to ignore the former check, and changing the compilation
flags to avoid the latter.
</p>

<p>
With all of those changes in place, "<q>everything works</q>" — but you do need
versions of Clang and Rust that use the same LLVM version. Functions are
inlined, the symbols don't cause linking errors, and it works for both built-in and
loadable modules. Hindborg tested it, and reported a speedup of a few percent,
Guo said.
He also suggested that with this tooling in place, it would even be possible to
generate the necessary helper functions automatically, which would be convenient.
</p>

<p>
Carlos Bilbao asked if there were cases for which this would not work, where the
helpers cannot be inlined. Guo replied that there were not — functions that
shouldn't be inlined don't need to be wrapped in helpers anyway.
</p>

<p>
Miguel Ojeda
asked what could be done to support GCC with this approach. There must be a
solution, Guo said, since GCC needs to support C++'s one-definition rule as
well. But unlike LLVM, GCC doesn't make it easy to save and edit
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GIMPLE">GIMPLE</a> (GCC's intermediate
representation). Boqun Feng suggested using GCC to compile the kernel, and Clang
only to compile helpers.c. That wouldn't work, Guo explained, because GCC and
Clang use different flags. Bindgen actually has some support for
translating them, but making sure that there are not problems with the linked
objects would be difficult.
</p>

<p>
Several audience members tossed around a few more suggestions for how Guo's
approach could be used with GCC as well, but the session wrapped up before
finding anything particularly actionable. It is not clear how stable his
approach is, but a performance improvement of a few percent is sure to tempt
people to keep working on it. In any case, the interface between Rust and C code
in the kernel is an area of considerable interest, and likely to remain so for
some time.

Sounds like this "LTO only for C called in Rust" is totally doable on LLVM end, but nobody had that need before so there isn't a feature for it. Instead of hacking around LLVM bytecode, IR manipulation and flags, why don't we make a feature request to LLVM (and later GCC) to do it for R4L?<br>
<p>
Something I can think of: mark the helpers.o symbols as "inline only". When linking: any objects referencing those symbols are force-LTO'ed; and after all linkings, delete those text and symbols.<br>

From LLVM IR level, inlinehint + linkonce_odr is essentially what you have described. It gets inlined during LTO, and unused functions get deleted without codegen functions get discarded without codegen. If LLVM heurstics decides not to inline something, the function gets emitted with weak linkage (if one doesn't want the heurstics, then replace inlinehint with alwaysinline).<br>
<p>
It's just you cannot tweak clang to generate this combination. It was attempted previously: <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D18095">https://reviews.llvm.org/D18095</a>, but it was rejected and the advice is keep post-processing IR.<br>

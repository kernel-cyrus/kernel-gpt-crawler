           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 28, 2015</br>
           </div>
In
an era of ongoing attacks and surveillance, proper generation of random
numbers is essential to the security of our systems and communications, so
the quality of our random numbers is often a topic of discussion.  The
performance with 
which the kernel comes up with random numbers is not normally as much of an
issue.  It turns out, though, that, on large NUMA systems with heavy demand
for random numbers, lock contention within the random-number generator
(RNG) can severely limit the performance of the system as a whole.  A patch
addressing that problem is relatively straightforward, but it provides an
opportunity to look at how this subsystem works in general.
<p>
Most readers will be familiar with the fact that the kernel's RNG subsystem
collects entropy (randomness) and provides it via two interfaces.  One,
exposed as <tt>/dev/random</tt>, is strictly limited so that it cannot
provide more entropy than has been collected by the system; the other
(<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>) functions as a pseudo-random-number generator 
to be able to continue to provide random data
when the supply of incoming entropy is not sufficient to meet the demand.
For most applications, even cryptographic applications, the latter
interface is more than sufficient, but <tt>/dev/random</tt> is there for
those who need truly random data and are able to wait for it if need be.
<p>
These interfaces are supported by three "entropy pools" within the kernel; an
entropy pool is an array of bytes of random data, along with some
supporting metadata.  Whenever randomness is collected by the kernel (be it
from interrupt timing, a hardware RNG, or some other source), it is added
to the input pool, which contains 4096 bits of data.  The pool is not a
simple FIFO of random bytes; instead, randomness is "mixed" into the pool
with an algorithm that resembles a CRC calculation.  The mixing is meant to
be fast (so it can be done from interrupt handlers) and to
spread the available entropy through the entire pool.  It is also intended
to keep the state of the pool from being known, even if the attacker is
able to write a large amount of known data into it.
<p>
The kernel maintains an estimate of the amount of entropy stored in the
pool at any given time.  That estimate increases when randomness is added
to the pool (by an amount that depends on an estimate of how random the
input data truly is), and it is decreased when entropy is removed from the
pool.

<p>
Since the pool is not a FIFO, one does not simply read random bytes out of
it.  Instead, entropy is extracted by calculating an SHA-1 hash of the
pool.  The hashed value is returned as the requested random data, but it is
also mixed back into the pool.  Using the hash will, once again, help to
keep the state of the pool from being known.
<p>
Users of random data do not simply read it from the input pool, though;
instead, the kernel maintains a simple hierarchy of three pools:
<p>
<blockquote>

scalability diagram]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reads from <tt>/dev/random</tt> will extract data from the blocking pool,
while reads from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> use the non-blocking pool.  The
output pools are smaller, each holding a maximum of 1024 bits of entropy in
the 4.4 kernel.
Entropy spills from the input pool into the two output pools in two ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Whenever incoming entropy causes the input pool to look full (the
     estimate of the entropy stored there approaches the pool size),
     entropy will be extracted from the input pool and mixed into both of
     the output pools.  The output pools can be filled to 75% of their
     maximum entropy in this manner.
<p>
<li> If an attempt is made to read more entropy from an output pool than is
     contained there, the needed entropy will be extracted from the input
     pool and mixed into the appropriate output pool.  This is the point
     where the two random interfaces differ in behavior:
     <tt>/dev/random</tt> will block if the input pool is also depleted,
     while <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> will generate random numbers regardless.
</ul>
<p>
Many years ago, data was read from the output pools without locking;
perhaps the potential for corruption of random data was not seen as being
particularly worrisome.  But it turned out that, on occasion, it was
possible for two processes to read the same random bytes, a vulnerability
that could make it possible for one process to know which random numbers
were being used by another.  So a spinlock was added to each pool to ensure
that access to the pools is properly serialized.
It is that locking that turns out to be a bottleneck if too many processes
(on a large number of CPUs) are trying to read random data at the same
time.
<p>
After running into the problem, Andi Kleen put together <a
href="/Articles/658329/">a patch set</a>
designed to alleviate this lock contention.  It uses the classic approach
of avoiding inter-CPU contention by giving each CPU (or, properly in this
case, each NUMA node) its own data.  To get there, Andi's patch modifies
the pool structure to look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/rng-scalability2.png" width=388 height=259 alt="[RNG
scalability diagram]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
In short: each NUMA node gets its own non-blocking pool to read from, so
reading random data no longer requires cross-node locking.  Each (along
with the blocking pool) receives
overflow from the input pool in a round-robin fashion, and each can draw
from that pool in response to a request if entropy is available.
There is, Andi
says, no need for per-CPU pools at this time, though things could be split
further in the future if that need were to arise.  There is also no plan to
make a per-node version of the blocking pool; code that is willing to wait
for sufficient entropy is unlikely to have trouble with locking
scalability.
<p>
The patch does indeed result in increased scalability for non-blocking
random-number generation on large systems.  It also has the effect of
distributing the entropy pool across nodes, making it that much harder to
guess the state of the pool as a whole.  One potential disadvantage is that
it is no longer possible to read out the state of all output pools at
system shutdown time, meaning that some entropy may be lost over a reboot.
That could 
be fixed with the addition of a new save/restore interface, but it is not
clear that anybody is concerned enough to do that work.
<p>
This patch has been through a set of revisions in response to comments and
seems likely to be ready for merging into the 4.5 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2017/">LSFMM 2017</a>
</div>
The opening session of the 2017 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit covered <a href="/Articles/644079/">a familiar
topic</a>: how to represent (possibly massive) persistent-memory arrays
to various subsystems in the kernel.  This session, led by Dan Williams,
focused in particular on the <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> abstraction and whether
the kernel should use <tt>page</tt> structures to represent persistent memory or
not.
<p>
<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> is tied into the memory allocator's zone system (which
segregates memory based on attributes like NUMA node or DMA reachability),
but in a 
special way.  It was created to satisfy the need to perform DMA operations
on persistent memory; these operations require <tt>page</tt> structures to
set up the mappings.  <tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> is, he said, essentially the top
half of the memory 
hotplug mechanism; it performs the memory setup, but does not actually put
the pages online for general use.  So memory located in
<tt>ZONE_DEVICE</tt> cannot be allocated in the normal ways, pages cannot
be migrated into that space, etc.  But it is possible to get a
<tt>page</tt> structure for memory in that zone.
<p>
Over the past few years, as the development community looked at the
implications of large persistent-memory arrays, developers were concerned
about the cost of using <tt>page</tt> structures — 64&nbsp;bytes for every

<a href="/Articles/717618/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/lsfmm/DanWilliams-sm.jpg" alt="[Dan Williams]"
title="Dan Williams" class="rthumb"></a>

4KB memory page.  That usage seemed wasteful, so some significant effort went
into trying to avoid using <tt>page</tt> structures altogether; instead, it
was thought that the management of persistent memory could be done entirely
with page-frame numbers (PFNs).  The <a
href="/Articles/672457/"><tt>pfn_t</tt> type</a>, along with a 
bunch of supporting structure, was added toward that goal, and developers
tried to convert the entire DMA API to use PFNs.  But then they ran into
the SPARC64 architecture, which cannot create DMA mappings without using
<tt>page</tt> 
structures.  The <tt>pfn_t</tt> effort, Williams said, died there.
<p>
Now, he said, perhaps the time has come to stop trying to avoid <tt>struct
page</tt>.  If, instead, we let drivers assume that <tt>page</tt> structures
will be available, we'll pay the memory-use cost in systems with terabytes of
persistent memory, but we'll avoid dealing with a lot of custom driver code
with inconsistent behavior.  That would solve the DMA problem, but that's
probably the easiest of the problems in this area; <tt>struct page</tt>
tends to pop up in a lot of places.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox observed that, in truth, few drivers really care about
<tt>struct page</tt> itself; it really just serves as a convenient handle
for referring to physical memory.  He suggested that it might make sense to
go back and take a hard look at why SPARC is stuck with using <tt>page</tt>
structures; Williams said it had to do with the management of cache
aliasing state.  James Bottomley suggested that there may be other ways to
solve this problem, such as using a separate array to hold aliasing
information.  It would just be a matter of persuading SPARC maintainer Dave
Miller.
<p>
If that persuasion could be accomplished, then <tt>pfn_t</tt> could be used
nearly everywhere and there would be less need to worry about the
availability of <tt>page</tt> structures.  A remaining problem might be
drivers that need to reach directly into DMA buffers but, Wilcox said,
they should just use <tt>ioremap()</tt> to get a usable address to work
with.
<p>
One of the big motivations for avoiding <tt>struct page</tt> with
persistent-memory arrays is that these structures can end up filling a
large portion of the system's ordinary memory.  The way to avoid that, of
course, is to allocate the structures in the persistent-memory itself;
Wilcox said that, whenever new memory is added to the system, its
associated page structures should always be located in that new memory.
The problem is that <tt>struct page</tt> can be a heavily used structure,
so there is value in having the ability to control its placement.
<p>
One possible solution to the memory-use problem is to allow <tt>page</tt>
structures to refer to 
larger pages — 2MB huge pages, for example.  The problem here is that
making the size variable would add overhead to some of the hottest code
paths in the kernel.  There would be CPU-time savings in some areas, since
the number of <tt>page</tt> structures to be managed would be reduced
considerably, but there are doubts that the savings would make up for the
higher costs in places like the page allocator.
<p>
Another option, Williams said, is to allocate <tt>page</tt> structures
dynamically when they are needed.  A persistent-memory array can be
terabytes in size, but <tt>page</tt> structures may only be needed for a
small portion of it.  If allocation of <tt>page</tt> structures can be made
cheap, it would make sense to only bring them into existence when the need
arises.
<p>
The conversation wound down in a wandering manner.  Bottomley suggested
using radix trees to track ranges of memory instead.  Kirill Shutemov
pointed out that different kinds of information are needed for different
page sizes; in the case of transparent huge pages, it may be necessary to
refer to a 4KB page as both a single page and a component of a huge page.
Rik van Riel said that <tt>page</tt> structures are only really an issue
for dynamic RAM; they can be dispensed with for persistent memory, since
filesystems can be counted on to free memory when it's no longer in use.
Bottomley replied that this approach is possible, but nobody has been
willing to implement it so far, leading Williams to observe that the group
would be talking about the same problem again next year.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hi Jon; thanks for the write-up as always!<br>
<p>
There was a certain amount of cross-talk and mis-speaking; drivers that need to reach into the scatterlist to manipulate the data need a kernel address.  What we said yesterday was "They should be using kmap_pfn()", which is actually a gross oversimplification.  For the benefit of our audience, on a 32-bit machine, the physical address may not be in lowmem, so you can't just do pfn_to_virt() or page_to_virt().<br>
<p>
What I now believe is that we need a kmap_sg() and then drivers don't need to care whether there's a PFN or a struct page in the scatterlist; they're getting the virtual address that they need.  I'm not sure whether we want a kmap_sg_atomic().  A quick grep tells me we already have scsi_kmap_atomic_sg() which looks ideal other than the "scsi_" prefix.  We also have bvec_kmap_irq(), bio_kmap_irqj() and __bio_kmap_atomic().  <br>

Why would anyone let SPARC64 requirements drive a design decision like this? That architecture is marginal and dying. And in this case it sounds like it could be worked around with some effort by the SPARC64 maintainer(s).<br>

I don't think it's accurate to say "marginal and dying".  For one thing, it is my strong suspicion that we will see persistent memory on SPARC64 CPUs given Oracle's focus.  It has a public roadmap going out to 2021.<br>
<p>
We wouldn't let, say, FR-V or Alpha disrupt persistent memory features, but I think SPARC64 is still relevant.<br>

It's not about being lazy, it's about tradeoffs.<br>
<p>
Suppose for the sake of argument that the only two options are #1 drop SPARC64 support or #2 all architectures must waste 64 bytes per 4K page. If the "don't break things" rule forces choice #1 then that means Linux performance on much more common systems is being dragged down by legacy baggage (especially after more similar decisions accumulate).<br>
<p>
Now suppose there's another option, #3 waste no memory and do a bunch of rearchitecting of the SPARC64 port to handle it. That sounds good, but what if the SPARC64 maintainer doesn't want to do the work? If you're 100% committed to "don't break things" then you can't motivate them by threatening to drop SPARC64 support. Instead the burden of reworking SPARC64 falls on whoever's implementing the core feature. That really sucks for various reasons, but in particular you're making core development that benefits many users much more difficult for the sake of some relatively very small number of users.<br>
<p>
"Lazy" is a pejorative term implying moral deficiency. There's nothing morally deficient about being honest about taking these tradeoffs seriously.<br>

In fact, it's not a waste. It's fundamental to many kernel paths. The DAX enabling without pages loses get_user_pages() support which disables not only DMA / direct-I/O, but also fundamental operations like fork and ptrace. We're already paying this 1.5% overhead for main memory, and my argument is that we should simply pay that overhead for persistent memory as well. It's not enough to convert some paths to use pfn_t and with new kmap() primitives, because that leaves us an ongoing maintenance burden of dual code paths as developers add new struct page usages. Unless we create a plan to get rid of struct page everywhere we should not special case persistent memory... especially when we have a mechanism to pay the overhead cost from pmem itself.<br>
<p>
Once we mandate struct page for DAX this appears to open up several clean up opportunities like re-using more of the the core page cache implementation and unifying device-DAX / filesystem-DAX.<br>

There are problems with that. Persistent memory is fast and durable, but not as fast and durable as the regular volatile RAM. So you have to put your page structures in the main RAM and this adds up quickly - a 2Tb persistent array will require around 32Gb or page structures.<br>

I'm not convinced that's going to be a problem in practice. Consider that the bulk of what makes struct page a frequently accessed data structure is when it is used by the core mm for general purpose page allocations. The ZONE_DEVICE mechanism never releases these pages for that high frequency usage. Another mitigation is that struct page writes are buffered by the cpu cache, which further reduces the write rate to media.<br>

<h1>Using sparse for endianness verification</h1>

Developers like to joke about Al Viro's fearsome presence on linux-kernel,
but the truth of the matter is that he has been relatively quiet there for
some time.  That does not mean, however, that he has become a full-time
Plan&nbsp;9 developer.  Instead, he has been steadily working to improve
the static analysis tools used to find kernel bugs before they bite users.  
<p>

In recent times, Al's work has resulted in a long series of patches merged
into the mainline, almost all of which have been marked as "endianness
annotations."  These patches mostly change the declared types for various
functions, variables, and structure members.  The new types may be
unfamiliar to many, since they are relatively new - though not <i>that</i>
new; they were introduced in 2.6.9.  These types are <tt>__le16</tt>,
<tt>__le32</tt>, <tt>__le64</tt>, <tt>__be16</tt>, <tt>__be32</tt>, and
<tt>__be64</tt>.
<p>

What these types represent is an attempt to encode whether the (unsigned)
integer value is big-endian (most significant byte first) or
little-endian.  For most programming, even within the kernel, endianness is
not a concern; things just work without much thought on the programmer's
part.  Kernel code often must work with data encoded in a specific byte
ordering which might not match the processor's ordering, though.  Network
protocols, filesystem on-disk data structures, and device registers are all
examples.  In general, when the kernel works with data in a non-native
ordering, it must first swap the bytes around to match the processor's
expectations.  Failure to do so can lead to all kinds of strange bugs.
<p>

There are a number of macros provided which can help with this task.
There are classic functions like <tt>htonl()</tt>, which converts a 32-bit
integer from host to "network" (big-endian) order.  More generally, the
kernel provides macros like <tt>__le32_to_cpu()</tt>, which will convert a
little-endian 32-bit quantity to the ordering required by the processor.
These macros make for portable code; they perform the requested
transformation on systems where it is needed, and simply vanish in the
remaining cases.
<p>

The conversion functions only work, however, when the programmer remembers
to use them.  In their absence, values in non-native byte orders simply
look like integers, and there is no way to catch the error until something
blows up.  And that might not happen to the original developer at all; the
code may work flawlessly until somebody tries to run it on a different
architecture and things fall apart.  
<p>

It would be nice to catch endianness mistakes at an earlier stage.  That is
the purpose of types like <tt>__be32</tt>; they allow a programmer to mark
data with a specific ordering when it first enters the system.  Thereafter,
a suitably smart tool can check the code which manipulates that data and
ensure that it does not mix that data with native-order data, does not try
to do arithmetic with it, etc.  Once everything is suitably annotated,
whole classes of bugs can be caught before the kernel is even booted.  And
that can only be a good thing.
<p>

The "suitably smart tool" which does this work is "sparse," a static
checker which was originally written by Linus Torvalds.  There is support
for sparse built into the kernel build system, making it easy to check code
for errors.  The one thing which remains relatively difficult, for whatever
reason, is getting the "sparse" tool in the first place.  Few distributors
package it, so prospective users must grab a copy and build it themselves.  
<p>

The true source for sparse is the git repository on kernel.org.  With git,
it's a simple matter of of running:
<p>
<pre>
    git clone  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/sparse.git
</pre>
<p>
A simple "make" in the resulting directory will yield a working
<tt>sparse</tt> binary.  This tool changes quickly enough that updating
from the repository on a regular basis is probably a good idea.  For people
who don't have git handy, it is also possible to grab a tarball snapshot
from <a
href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/sparse/">Dave
Jones's site</a>.
<p>

Once <tt>sparse</tt> is installed, running it on the kernel is a simple
matter of going to your local source tree and running:
<p>
<pre>
    make C=2
</pre>
<p>
The parameter <tt>C=2</tt> causes <tt>sparse</tt> to be run on every
<tt>.c</tt> file; if <tt>C=1</tt> is used instead, only files which must be
recompiled are checked.  Checking for endianness problems requires an
additional parameter:
<p>
<pre>
    make C=2 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__
</pre>
<p>

The number of warnings which result from this command can be large - though
it is dropping as Al works his way through the code.
<p>

Checking code submissions with <tt>sparse</tt> is highly recommended - it
is one of the steps in the <a href="/Articles/205636/">patch submission
checklist</a> packaged with the kernel.  Use of <tt>sparse</tt> may still
be more of an exception than the rule, however.  But it is easy enough -
and useful enough - that there really is no reason not to run the checker
on code before sending it out.  It is, after all, much nicer to have the
computer find silly mistakes for you, in the privacy of your own computer,
before broadcasting them to the world.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I completely agree with Jon's endorsement of sparse.  It's trivial to build and almost trivial to install.  I say "almost trivial" because for some reason the binary it builds is called "check", while the program that the kernel build expects to run is called "sparse".  So if you're not one to run "make install", remember to "cp check $DESTDIR/sparse".<br>
<p>
I used sparse heavily to annotate the ipath driver in several different ways: endianness, opacity of some types, and visibility to userspace.  These absolutely helped me to find and squish bugs that would not otherwise have been obvious, especially the endianness annotations (which makes sense, since the ipath driver is a network driver).<br>

      sparse is now available in Fedora Extras for FC 5, 6, and -devel, and I'll be packaging it there going forward.  Enjoy!<br>

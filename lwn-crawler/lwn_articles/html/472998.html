<h1>A common clock framework</h1>

<p>
One of the big problem areas that has been identified in the ARM kernel
trees is the diversity of implementations for various things that could be
shared&mdash;either within the ARM tree or more widely with the rest of the
kernel.  That problem has led to a large amount of duplicated code in the
ARM tree, both via cut-and-paste and code that is conceptually similar but
uses different data structures and APIs.  The latter makes the creation of
a single kernel image that can boot on multiple ARM platforms impossible, so
there are efforts to consolidate these implementations.  The common clock
framework is one such effort.
</p>

<p>
In a typical ARM system-on-chip (SoC), there can be dozens of different
clocks for use by various I/O and other devices in the SoC.  Typically
those clocks are hooked together into elaborate tree-like structures.  In
those trees, 
child clocks can sometimes only change their frequency if the parent
(and any other children) are correspondingly changed; disabling certain
clocks will affect other clocks in the system and so on.  Each ARM
platform/SoC has its own way of encapsulating that information and
presenting it to other parts of the system (like power and thermal
management controllers), which makes it difficult to create
platform-independent solutions.

<p>
The first problem that a common clock framework faces is the sheer number
of different <tt>struct&nbsp;clk</tt> definitions scattered throughout the ARM
tree. There are more than two dozen definitions in <tt>arch/arm</tt>
currently, but the <a href="/Articles/472093/">proposal</a> for a common
framework not surprisingly reduces that number to one.  Implementations can
wrap the <tt>struct&nbsp;clk</tt> in another structure that holds
hardware-specific data, but the common structure looks like:
<pre>
    struct clk {
	const char                  *name;
	const struct clk_hw_ops     *ops;
	struct clk                  *parent;
	unsigned long               rate;
	unsigned long               flags;
	unsigned int                enable_count;
	unsigned int                prepare_count;
	struct hlist_head           children;
	struct hlist_node           child_node;
    };
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>parent</tt> and <tt>children</tt>/<tt>child_node</tt> fields allow
the clocks to be arranged
into trees, while the <tt>rate</tt> field tracks the 
current clock frequency (in Hz).  The
<tt>flags</tt> field is used to describe the clock
type (e.g. whether a rate change needs to be done on the parent clock, or
that the clock must be disabled before changing the rate). The two <tt>*_count</tt> fields are for tracking calls to the enable
and prepare operations, while the bulk of the "work" is done within the
<tt>struct 
clk_hw_ops</tt> field (<tt>ops</tt>). 
</p>

<p>
Each of the entries in the <tt>clk_hw_ops</tt> structure correspond to a
function in the driver-facing API for the clock framework.  That API does
some sanity checking before calling the corresponding operation from
<tt>clk_hw_ops</tt>:
<pre>
    struct clk_hw_ops {
	int             (*prepare)(struct clk *clk);
	void            (*unprepare)(struct clk *clk);
	int             (*enable)(struct clk *clk);
	void            (*disable)(struct clk *clk);
	unsigned long   (*recalc_rate)(struct clk *clk);
	long            (*round_rate)(struct clk *clk, unsigned long,
				      unsigned long *);
	int             (*set_parent)(struct clk *clk, struct clk *);
	struct clk *    (*get_parent)(struct clk *clk);
	int             (*set_rate)(struct clk *clk, unsigned long);
    };
</pre>
<tt>clk_prepare()</tt> is used to initialize
the clock to a state where it could be enabled, and that call must be made
before <tt>clk_enable()</tt>, which actually starts the clock running.
<tt>clk_disable()</tt> and <tt>clk_unprepare()</tt> do the reverse and
should be called in that order. The difference is that
<tt>clk_prepare()</tt> can sleep, while <tt>clk_enable()</tt> must not, so
having two separate calls allows the clock initialization to be split into
atomic and non-atomic pieces.
</p>

<p>
<tt>clk_get_parent()</tt> and <tt>clk_set_parent()</tt> do what the names
imply, simply returning or changing the <tt>parent</tt>
field, though setting the parent only succeeds if the clock is not already
in use (otherwise -EBUSY is returned). <tt>clk_recalc_rate()</tt> queries
the hardware, rather than the 
cached <tt>rate</tt> field, for the current frequency of the
clock. <tt>clk_round_rate()</tt> rounds a frequency in Hz to a rate that
the clock can actually use, and can also be used to determine the correct
frequency for the parent clock when changing rates.  All of those are more or less helper functions
for <tt>clk_set_rate()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
<tt>clk_set_rate()</tt> changes the frequency of a clock, but it must take
into account some other factors.  If the <tt>CLK_PARENT_SET_RATE</tt> flag
value is set for the clock, <tt>clk_set_rate()</tt> needs to propagate the
change to the parent clock (which may also have that flag set,
necessitating a recursive traversal of the tree, attempting to set the rate
at each level).

<p>
Drivers can also register their interest in being notified of rate changes
with the <tt>clk_notifier_register()</tt> function.   Three different types
of notification can be requested: before the clock's rate
changes, after it has been changed, or if the change gets aborted after the
pre-change notifications have been called (i.e. <tt>PRE_RATE_CHANGE</tt>,
<tt>POST_RATE_CHANGE</tt>, and <tt>ABORT_RATE_CHANGE</tt>).   In each case,
both the old and new values for the rate get passed as part of the
notification callback. The <a href="/Articles/473214/">patch</a> to add notifications
creates another operation in <tt>clk_hw_ops</tt> called
<tt>speculate_rate()</tt>, 
which notes potential rate changes and sends any needed pre-change
notifications as it walks the sub-tree.
</p>

<p>
The patch set also exports the clock hierarchy into debugfs.  Each
top-level clock gets a directory in <tt>../debug/clk</tt> that contains
read-only files to report the clock's rate, flags, prepare and enable
counts, and the number of notifiers registered.  Subdirectories are created
for each child clock containing the same information.

<p>
The common clock framework has been around for some time in various forms.
The current incarnation is being shepherded by Mike Turquette, but he <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1218622">notes</a>
that it is based on work originally done by Jeremy Kerr and Ben
Herrenschmidt.  Beyond that: "<q>Many others contributed to those
patches and promptly had their work stolen by me</q>". 
Turquette has also <a href="/Articles/473209/">posted</a> a patch set with
an example
that replaces the OMAP4 clocks using the framework.

<p>
The comments on
the most recent iteration have been fairly light, but still substantive, so
we are clearly a ways off from seeing a version in the mainline.  It's
clearly on the radar of ARM developers, and would clean up a fair amount of
code duplication within that tree, so we should see something in the
mainline soon&mdash;hopefully in one of the next few kernel releases.

"unprepare"?  Seriously?<br>
I guess it's better than "postpare" or "dispare".<br>
"probe"/"shutdown" might work if the "prepare" needs to examine the clock in some way.  There is precedent for that.<br>
"startup"/"shutdown" or "online"/"offline" might work too.<br>
There are probably lots of possibilities.  but "unprepare"?  That's not even a word!!!!<br>

      I don't like it either, but I can't deny that it's a word. Ghastly neologisms are still words - and unlike many ghastly neologisms, I can even look at it and be reasonably confident that (a) it has a strong meaning (b) the meaning would be apparent to any fluent speaker of English.

It may be a word, but I've never heard of it. As a native English speaker, I'm a bit confused by what it would mean.<br>

unprepare - (v) Put yourself back into a state that you are not prepared.<br>

<i>What else could "unprepare" as a verb mean</i>
<p>
The process of making yourself unprepared.

<p>To me, it doesn't mean that you have to be prepared in the first place. If you don't do anything to get yourself ready for a presentation, one could say: "I will unprepare myself for the presentation".
<p>
Face it, the term sucks. It's silly. startup() and shutdown() are much better terms and more recognizable. As with all technical operations, it is best not to come up with new terms that may lead to confusion. The clearer you make your function names, the clearer you code will be to understand.

<p>
Why? You can't prepare yourself if you are already prepared, can you? So by symmetry unpreparing implies that you were prepared, and somehow undo that state.<br>
<p>
To this non-native speaker at least.<br>
<p>
That said, I have no beef with the alternative verbs given in this thread.<br>

      <p>I've seen it many times before: you see group of people, they all talk using English and have no problems understanding each other. Suddenly someone says: "no, you can not say <i>&lt;this&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;that&gt;</i>" and then fails to explain <b>why</b>. Invariably that someone is native speaker and he can not explain why you can not say <i>&lt;this&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;that&gt;</i> <b>because there are no simple explanation</b>.</p>

<p>If you'll ask linguist then usually source of the problem can be found: perhaps 200 years ago word was ostracized because it was too similar to some vulgar slang. It may be 300 years ago the original world (if this <i>&lt;this&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;that&gt;</i> are some modifications of other word) had slightly different meaning and so <b><i>un</i></b><i>&lt;this&gt;</i> or <b><i>im</i></b><i>&lt;that&gt;</i> made do sense. Sometimes even linguists have no explanation and can just cite some 100 years old articles which said (without explanation) that "<i>&lt;this&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;that&gt;</i> is not a word, don't use it".</p>

<p>This phenomenon if not restricted to English, this happens with all languages, of course.</p>

<p>As for me, I've filed "unprepare" under "strange aberration where English does not give you right to use seemingly simple and clear word". Really: why "unstick" <b>does</b> mean that something was stuck and "uncork" <b>does</b> mean that something was corked yet "unprepare" does not mean that someone was prepared?</p>

<p>Apparently the answer is "for historical reason": Marriam-Webster <b>does</b> include this word but gives the following explanation - "to cause to be <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unprepared">unprepared</a> : make unfit or unready &lt;the purpose  is precisely to <i>unprepare</i> the reader  W.M.Frohock&gt;" thus apparently you don't need to be prepared before you'll be unprepared, this can happen from "normal state", too.</p>

<p>
As non-native English speaker I perceived "unprepare" not as to undo the preparations but rather as to go from the initial state to the state where one would spend more efforts later if he wants to prepare. "Unprepare for a trip" would mean in that interpretation not to empty a travel bag and put things from it back to the shelves where they were before, but to make even more mess at home so it would be more difficult at some later point to pack things together in preparations for the trip.<br>

It's in Merriam-Webster (Unabridged): "To cause to be unprepared; to make unfit or unready." It's certainly uncommon, but I don't think it's hard to understand or suggestive of the wrong thing. It's hardly a neologism; it's got a citation to someone who's been dead for 27 years.<br>

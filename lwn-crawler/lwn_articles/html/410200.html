<h1>trace-cmd: A front-end for Ftrace</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="GAByline">
           <p>October 20, 2010</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Steven Rostedt</p>
           </div>
<p>Previous LWN articles have
explained the basic way to use Ftrace directly through the debugfs filesystem (<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/365835/">part 1</a> and <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366796/">part 2</a>). While the debugfs interface is rather simple, it can also be awkward to
work with. It is especially convenient, though, for embedded platforms where
it may be difficult to build and install special user tools on the device.
On the desktop, it may be more convenient to have a command-line tool
that works with Ftrace instead of echoing various commands into
strange files and reading the result from another file. This tool does
exist, and it is called <tt>trace-cmd</tt>.  </p>

<p>
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> is a user-space front-end command-line tool for
Ftrace.  You can download it from the git repository at <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/rostedt/trace-cmd.git;a=summary">
<tt>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/trace-cmd.git</tt></a>. Some
distributions ship it as a package, and some that currently do not, will
soon.  There are full man pages included, which are installed with a
<tt>make&nbsp;install_doc</tt>.  This article will not go over the information
that is already in the man pages, but instead will explain a little about
how <tt>trace-cmd</tt> works and how to use it.  </p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p> A simple use case of <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is to record a trace and then
report it.  </p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd record -e ext4 ls
    [...]
    # trace-cmd report
    version = 6
    CPU 1 is empty
    cpus=2
           trace-cmd-7374  [000]  1062.484227: ext4_request_inode:   \
	   		   	  dev 253:2 dir 40801 mode 33188
           trace-cmd-7374  [000]  1062.484309: ext4_allocate_inode:  \
	   		   	  dev 253:2 ino 10454 dir 40801 mode 33188
</pre>

<p> The above example enables the ext4 tracepoints for Ftrace, runs the
<tt>ls</tt> command and records the Ftrace data into a file named
<tt>trace.dat</tt>. The <tt>report</tt> command reads the
<tt>trace.dat</tt> file and outputs the tracing data to standard
output. Some metadata is also shown before the trace output is displayed: the version of the
file, any empty CPU buffers, and the number of CPUs that were recorded.
</p>

<p> By default, the <tt>record</tt> and <tt>report</tt> options write and
read to the <tt>trace.dat</tt> file. You can use the <tt>-o</tt> or
<tt>-i</tt> options to pick a different file to write to or read from
respectively, but this article will use the default name when
referencing the data file created by <tt>trace-cmd</tt>.  </p>

<p> When recording a trace, <tt>trace-cmd</tt> will fork off a process for
each CPU on the system.  Each of these processes will open the file
in debugfs that represents the CPU the process is
dedicated to record from. The process recording CPU0 will open
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/per_cpu/cpu0/trace_pipe_raw</tt>, the process
recording CPU1 will open a similar file in the <tt>cpu1</tt> directory, and
so on.  The <tt>trace_pipe_raw</tt> file is a mapping directly to the
Ftrace internal buffer for each CPU. Each of these CPU processes will read
these files using splice to record into a temporary file during the
trace. At the end of the record, the main process will concatenate the
temporary files into a single <tt>trace.dat</tt> file.  </p>

<p> There's no need to manually mount the debugfs filesystem before using
the tool as <tt>trace-cmd</tt> will look to see if and where it is mounted. If
debugfs is not mounted, it will automatically mount it at
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug</tt>.  </p>

<h4>Recording a trace</h4>

<p>As noted above, <tt>trace-cmd</tt>
forks off a process for each CPU dedicated to record from that CPU but, in
order to prevent scheduling interference, the
threads are not pinned to a CPU.  Pinning the threads to the CPU being
traced may result in better cache usage, so a future version of
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> may add an option to do that.
The Ftrace ring buffers are allocated one
per CPU, and each thread will read from a particular CPU's ring buffer. It is important
to mention this because these threads can show up in the trace. 

<p>
A common
request is to have <tt>trace-cmd</tt> ignore events that are caused by
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> itself. But it is not wise to ignore these events because
they show where the tracer may have made an impact on what it is
tracing. These events can be filtered out after the trace, but they are
good to keep around in the <tt>trace.dat</tt> file in case some delay
was caused by the trace itself, and the events may show that. </p>

<p> As <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is a front end to Ftrace, the arguments of
<tt>record</tt> reflect some of the features of Ftrace. The <tt>-e</tt>
option enables an event. The argument following the <tt>-e</tt> can be an
event name, event subsystem name, or the special name <tt>all</tt>. The
<tt>all</tt> name will make <tt>trace-cmd</tt> enable all events that the
system supports. If a subsystem name is specified, then all events under that
subsystem will be enabled during the trace. For example, specifying
<tt>sched</tt> will enable all the events within the <tt>sched</tt>
subsystem. To enable a single event, the event name can be used by itself, or the
<tt>subsystem:event</tt> format can be used. If the subsystem name is left off, then all events with
the given name will be enabled. Currently this would not be an issue
because, as of this writing, all events have unique names.  If more than
one event or subsystem is to be traced, then multiple <tt>-e</tt> options may
be specified.  </p>

<p> Ftrace also has special plugin tracers that do not simply trace
specific events.  These tracers include the function, function graph, and
latency tracers. Through the debugfs <tt>tracing</tt> directory, these
plugins are 
enabled by echoing the type of tracer into the <tt>current_tracer</tt>
file. With <tt>trace-cmd&nbsp;record</tt>, they are enabled with the
<tt>-p</tt> option. Using the tracer plugin name as the argument for
<tt>-p</tt> enables that plugin. You can still specify one or more events
with a plugin, but you may only specify a single plugin, or no plugin at
all.  </p>

<p>
When the record is finished, <tt>trace-cmd</tt> examines the kernel buffers
and outputs some statistics, which may be a little confusing. Here's an
example: 
</p>

<pre>
    Kernel buffer statistics:
      Note: "entries" are the entries left in the kernel ring buffer and are not
            recorded in the trace data. They should all be zero.

    CPU: 0
    entries: 0
    overrun: 0
    commit overrun: 0

    CPU: 1
    [...]
</pre>

<p> As the output explains, the <tt>entries</tt> field is not the number of
entries that were traced, but the number of entries left in the kernel
buffer.  If entries were dropped because <tt>trace-cmd</tt> could not read
the buffer faster than it was being written to, and the writer overflowed
the buffer, then either the <tt>overrun</tt> or <tt>commit overrun</tt>
values would be something other than zero. The <tt>overrun</tt> value is
the number of entries that were dropped due to the buffer filling up, and
the writer deleting the older entries.  
<p>
The <tt>commit overrun</tt> is much
less likely to occur. Writes to the buffer is a three step process. First
the writer reserves space in the ring buffer, then it writes to it, then it
commits the change. Writing to the buffer does not disable interrupts. If a
write is preempted by an interrupt, and the interrupt performs a large
amount of tracing where it fills the buffer up to the point of the space
that was reserved for
the write it preempted, then it must drop events because it cannot touch
the reserved space until it is committed.  These dropped events 
are the <tt>commit overrun</tt>.  This is highly unlikely to happen unless
you have a small buffer.  </p>

<h4>Filtering while recording</h4>

<p> As explained in  "<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/370423/">Secrets of the Ftrace function
tracer</a>", Ftrace allows you to filter what functions will be traced by
the function tracer. Also, you can graph a single function, or a select set of
functions, with the function graph tracer. These features are not lost when
using 
<tt>trace-cmd</tt>.  </p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd record -p function -l 'sched_*' -n 'sched_slice'
</pre>

<p>
(Note that the above does not specify a command to execute, so 
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> will record until <tt>Ctrl^C</tt> is hit.)
</p>

<p> The <tt>-l</tt> option is the same as echoing its argument into
<tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt>, and the <tt>-n</tt> option is the same as echoing
its argument into <tt>set_ftrace_notrace</tt>. You can have more than
one <tt>-l</tt> or <tt>-n</tt> option on the command
line. <tt>trace-cmd</tt> will simply write all the arguments into the
appropriate file. Note, those options are only useful with the
<tt>function</tt> and <tt>function_graph</tt> plugins.  The <tt>-g</tt>
option (not shown) will pass its argument into the
<tt>set_graph_function</tt> file.  </p>

<p>
Here is a nice trick to see how long interrupts take in the kernel:
</p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd record -p function_graph -l do_IRQ -e irq_handler_entry sleep 10
    # trace-cmd report
    version = 6
    cpus=2
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.154882: funcgraph_entry:                   |  do_IRQ() {
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.154887: irq_handler_entry:    irq=21 name=sata_nv
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.154952: funcgraph_exit:       + 71.706 us  |  }
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.156948: funcgraph_entry:                   |  do_IRQ() {
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.156952: irq_handler_entry:    irq=22 name=ehci_hcd:usb1
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.156955: irq_handler_entry:    irq=22 name=NVidia CK804
            Xorg-4262  [001] 212767.156985: funcgraph_exit:       + 37.795 us  |  }
</pre>

<p> The events can also be filtered. To know what fields can be used for
filtering a specific event, look in the <tt>format</tt> file from
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/&lt;subsystem&gt;/&lt;event&gt;/format</tt>,
or run
<pre>
    # trace-cmd report --events | less
</pre> 
on a <tt>trace.dat</tt>
file that was created by the local system. The <tt>--events</tt> argument
will list 
the event formats of all events that were available in the system that
created the tracing file:  </p>

<pre>
    $ trace-cmd report --events
    [...]
    name: <b>kmalloc_node</b>
    ID: 338
    format:
        field:unsigned short common_type;       offset:0;       size:2; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_flags;       offset:2;       size:1; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;       offset:3;       size:1; signed:0;
        field:int common_pid;   offset:4;       size:4; signed:1;
        field:int common_lock_depth;    offset:8;       size:4; signed:1;

        field:unsigned long call_site;  offset:16;      size:8; signed:0;
        field:const void * ptr; offset:24;      size:8; signed:0;
        field:size_t <b>bytes_req</b>; offset:32;      size:8; signed:0;
    [...]
</pre>

<p> Using the <tt>kmalloc_node</tt> event, we can filter on all requests
that were greater than 1000 bytes: </p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd record -e kmalloc_node -f 'bytes_req > 1000'
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>-f</tt> option specifies a filter for the event (specified in a
<tt>-e</tt> option) preceding it. 
</p>

<h4>Reading the trace</h4>

<p> As the initial example showed, to read the trace simply run the
<tt>report</tt> command. By default, it will read the <tt>trace.dat</tt>
file, unless the <tt>-i</tt> option specifies a different file to read, or
the input file may simply be specified as the last argument.  </p>

<pre>
    $ trace-cmd report -i mytrace.dat
    $ trace-cmd report mytrace.dat
</pre>

<p> The above two examples give the same result. The report command is not
a privileged operation and only requires read permission on the data file
it is reading.  </p>

<pre>
    $ trace-cmd report
    version = 6
    cpus=2
      trace-cmd-8412  [000] 13140.422056: sched_switch:         8412:120:S ==&gt; 0:120: swapper
        &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 13140.422068: power_start:          type=1 state=2
        &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 13140.422174: irq_handler_entry:    irq=0 handler=timer
        &lt;idle&gt;-0     [000] 13140.422180: irq_handler_exit:     irq=0 return=handled
</pre>

<p> The output is similar to what you would see in
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace</tt>.  </p>

<p> Having the trace data in a file gives some advantages over reading from
a
debugfs file.  We can now easily filter what events we want to see, or pick
a specific CPU to output.  </p> <p> You can do extensive filtering on
events and what CPUs you want to focus on:

<pre>
    $ trace-cmd report --cpu 0 -F 'sched_wakeup: success == 1'
    version = 6
    cpus=2
          ls-8414  [000] 13140.423106: sched_wakeup: 8414:?:? + 8412:120:? trace-cmd Success
          ls-8414  [000] 13140.424179: sched_wakeup: 8414:?:? + 1155:120:? kondemand/0 Success
          ls-8414  [000] 13140.426925: sched_wakeup: 8414:?:? + 704:120:? phy0 Success
          ls-8414  [000] 13140.431172: sched_wakeup: 8414:?:? + 9:120:? events/0 Success
      events/0-9   [000] 13140.431182: sched_wakeup: 9:?:? + 11734:120:? sshd Success
          ls-8414  [000] 13140.434173: sched_wakeup: 8414:?:? + 1155:120:? kondemand/0 Success
</pre>

<p> The <tt>--cpu&nbsp;0</tt> limits the output to only show the events that
occurred on CPU 0.  The <tt>-F</tt> option limits
the output further to only show <tt>sched_wakeup</tt> events that have its
success field equal to&nbsp;1. For more information about the filtering,
consult the <tt>trace-cmd-report(1)</tt> man page.

<h4>Tracing over the network</h4>

<p> There may be situations where you want to trace an embedded device or some
machine with very little disk space. Perhaps another machine has lots of
disk space and you want to record the trace to that machine or maybe you
are tracing the filesystem itself and minimal interference to that
code is needed.  This is where tracing over the network comes in handy.
</p>

<p>
To set up a trace server, simply run something like the following command:
</p>

<pre>
    $ trace-cmd listen -p 12345 -D -d /images/tracing/ -l /images/tracing/logfile
</pre>

<p> The only required option in the above is the <tt>-p</tt> option, which
tells <tt>trace-cmd</tt> what port to listen on. The <tt>-D</tt> puts
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> into daemon mode, while the <tt>-d&nbsp;/images/tracing/</tt> tells
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> to output the trace files from the connections it
receives into the <tt>/images/tracing/</tt> directory. Obviously, any
directory you have write permission for can be used here. The <tt>-l&nbsp;/images/tracing/logfile</tt> tells <tt>trace-cmd</tt> to not write messages
to standard output, but to the <tt>/images/tracing/logfile</tt> file
instead. The listen command is not
privileged, and can be run by any user.  </p>

<p> On the embedded device (or whatever client is used), instead of
specifying a output file in the <tt>trace-cmd&nbsp;record</tt> the <tt>-N</tt>
option is used followed by <tt>host:port</tt> syntax.  </p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd record -N gandalf:12345 -e sched_switch -e sched_wakeup -e irq hackbench 50
</pre>

<p> Back on the host <tt>gandalf</tt> a file is made in the
<tt>/images/tracing/</tt> directory of the format
"<tt>trace.&lt;client-host&gt;:&lt;client-port&gt;.dat</tt>".  </p>

<pre>
    $ ls /images/tracing/
    logfile  trace.frodo:35287.dat

    $ cat /images/tracing/logfile
    [29078]Connected with frodo:35287

    [29078]pagesize=4096

    $ trace-cmd report /images/tracing/trace.frodo\:35287.dat
    version = 6
    cpus=2
        &lt;...&gt;-17215 [000] 19858.840695: sched_switch:      17215:120:S ==&gt; 0:120: swapper

<p> <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is versatile enough to handle heterogeneous systems.
All the information needed to create and read the <tt>trace.dat</tt> file
is passed from the client to the host. The host could be a 64-bit x86 and
the client a 32-bit PowerPC and the above would not change. A big-endian
machine can read a little-endian file and vice versa. The compatibility to
read various system types is not limited to 
network tracing. If a trace is performed on a big-endian 32-bit system, the
resulting file can still be read from a little-endian 64-bit system.  </p>

<h4>For the lazy Ftrace user</h4>

<p> If using the internal kernel
Ftrace buffer is sufficient and there is no need to record the trace,
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> can still be useful. Pretty 
much all of the <tt>record</tt> options can be used with the <tt>trace-cmd&nbsp;start</tt>
command. <tt>start</tt> does not create a <tt>trace.dat</tt>
file, but simply starts Ftrace.
Similarly, the <tt>stop</tt> command is just a convenient way to do:
<pre>
    $ echo&nbsp;0&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
</pre>  
For example: </p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd start -p function_graph -g ip_rcv

    # sleep 10

    # trace-cmd stop

    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
    # tracer: function_graph
    #
    # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
    # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
     1)               |  ip_rcv() {
     1)               |    T.769() {
     1)               |      nf_hook_slow() {
     1)   0.497 us    |        add_preempt_count();
     1)               |        nf_iterate() {
     1)   0.458 us    |          ip_sabotage_in();
</pre>

<p>
If there is a case where the trace needs to be converted
into a <tt>trace.dat</tt> file, the <tt>extract</tt> command can be
used. After 
the above trace was done:
</p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd extract -o kernel-buf.dat

    # trace-cmd report kernel-buf.dat
    version = 6
    cpus=2
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661193: funcgraph_entry:          |  ip_rcv() {
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661196: funcgraph_entry:          |    T.769() {
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661197: funcgraph_entry:          |      nf_hook_slow() {
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661197: funcgraph_entry: 0.497 us |        add_preempt_count();
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661198: funcgraph_entry:          |        nf_iterate() {
       &lt;idle&gt;-0  [001] 214146.661199: funcgraph_entry: 0.458 us |          ip_sabotage_in();
</pre>

<p>
To disable all tracing, which will ensure that no overhead is left from using
the function tracers or events, the <tt>reset</tt> command can be used.  It
will disable all of Ftrace and bring the system back to full performance.
</p>

<pre>
    # trace-cmd reset
</pre>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p> This article explains some of the use cases for
<tt>trace-cmd</tt>.  There is still more that it can do but we just did not
have the space to fit it all in. This article and the
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> man pages should be enough to get you on your way to
using <tt>trace-cmd</tt> in a productive manner.  </p>

<p> So what's next? As this article shows how <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is a
front-end tool for Ftrace, the next article will present <tt>kernelshark</tt>
which is a graphical front-end to <tt>trace-cmd</tt>. Stay tuned. </p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Something I don't see above is the "trace this program and display output immediately", i.e. without storing to a file. strace and ltrace both have this mode and for simple things I find it more useful. <br>
<p>
For example, while testing I tend to first use strace directly to tune the filter options (quick check whether there's too much or too little output) and when that's right, save it to a file. An option to stop tracing after a certain number of messages would also be useful.<br>
<p>
That aside, it looks like a fantastic tool that would let me get started with tracing without having to have the documentation next to me the whole time.<br>

The kernel's memory-management developers have been busy before and during
the holidays; the result is a number of patch sets making significant
changes to that subsystem.  It is time for a quick look at three of those
projects.  Two of them aim to increase the sharing of page tables between
processes, while the third takes advantage of the <a
href="/Articles/894859/">multi-generational LRU</a> to create a better
picture of what a process's working set actually is.
<p>
<h4>Revisiting msharefs</h4>
<p>
Some applications are structured as a large set of independent processes,
all sharing a (potentially large) region of memory.  Each of those
processes will have its own set of page tables for that shared region.
Duplicating page tables imposes a relatively small cost when the number of
processes is low, but when that number gets large, the memory occupied by
page tables may exceed the size of the memory region they refer to.  In
many cases, this duplication of page tables brings no extra value.
<p>
For some time, Khaled Aziz has been working on a mechanism to allow
cooperating processes to share page tables referring to a shared memory
area; this work has, at times, taken the form of <a
href="/Articles/895217/">the <tt>mshare()</tt> system call</a> and <a
href="/Articles/901059/">the msharefs filesystem</a>.  There have been
concerns raised with both solutions, so now Aziz is back with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1670287695.git.khalid.aziz@oracle.com/">yet
another attempt</a>.

This implementation does away with new system calls and filesystems and,
instead, just adds a new flag (<tt>MAP_SHARED_PT</tt>) to the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
system call.  If a process maps a shared segment (implying that
<tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> must also be provided) with this new flag, then the
page tables mapping this segment will also be shared with the other users,
saving the overhead of making an independent copy of those tables.
<p>
As with the other versions, there are some interesting semantics and
limitations associated with shared page tables.  Any address-space changes
(such as an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html"><tt>mprotect()</tt></a>
call) made to the shared region by one process will apply to every process
sharing the page tables; that is seen as an advantage for some use cases.
The memory segment must be aligned at the PMD level (2MB on many
architectures), and it must be mapped at the same virtual address in all
processes.  The same-address requirement could perhaps be removed, Aziz
said, if there is a reason to do so.
<p>
Underneath the API, the implementation of page-table sharing follows the
same lines as before.  A separate <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure is created
to manage the shared region as if it were a separate address space.
<p>
There have been no comments on the new version so far.  One might expect
that using <tt>mmap()</tt> would address most of the concerns about the
user-space API for this feature.  But this kind of page-table sharing, with
its unique semantics, represents a significant memory-management change to
serve a relatively rare use case.  It is not yet clear that the case has
been made that this functionality is worth the cost.
<p>
<h4>Copy-on-write page tables</h4>
<p>
A different, and somewhat more transparent, approach to page-table sharing
can be found in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221220072743.3039060-1-shiyn.lin@gmail.com/">this
patch set</a> from Chih-En Lin.  When a process calls <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><tt>fork()</tt></a>,
the new child process will share its memory with the parent.  Any writable
pages are marked copy-on-write (COW); should either process write to a COW
page, that page will first be copied (breaking the sharing) so that the
other process does not see the change.  Sharing memory in this way saves a
lot of copying, especially if the child process will not actually use much
of the parent's memory.
<p>
While the parent's memory is not copied into the child on <tt>fork()</tt>,
the parent's page tables <i>are</i> copied.  If the parent process has a
large address space, that copying can still create a significant cost, and
it may be entirely useless if the child does not access that memory.  Lin
seeks to reduce that cost by, instead, extending the COW mechanism to the
bottom (PTE) level of the page-table hierarchy.
<p>
A process must opt into the  COW behavior with a new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
command (<tt>PR_SET_COW_PTE</tt>).  Once that has been done, any new child
processes will be created with shared page tables.  The usual COW behavior
applies here; should either process make a change to a PTE page, that page
will be copied and the sharing will be broken.  An <tt>mprotect()</tt>
call, for example, would end up copying the affected page-table pages.
Thus, COW page tables should not result in any behavioral changes visible
to either side, other than <tt>fork()</tt> calls running a bit more quickly
and requiring less memory.
<p>
Of course, that is not quite true.  While a <tt>fork()</tt> may be a bit
faster, other operations, including page-fault handling, may be slower due
to the need to break the sharing of the page-table pages.  Whether this
sharing is beneficial overall may thus vary depending on the workload;
benchmark results included in the cover letter show a 3-5% performance
increase for some workloads, and a slight decrease for others.  This
variability of results explains the need to opt into the COW behavior; for
most workloads it probably will not make enough of a difference to be worth
the trouble.
<p>
Here, too, the implementation adds a certain amount of complexity to the
core memory-management code.  The sharing of page-table pages requires the
addition of a reference count to each of those pages so the kernel knows
when they are no longer in use.  There are numerous operations that can
require the sharing to be broken, including transparent huge-page collapse,
kernel same-page merging, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
calls, and more.  The code also has to properly handle page-table pages
that cannot be shared, including those referring to pages that are pinned
or mapped to device memory.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220519183127.3909598-1-shiyn.lin@gmail.com/">first
posting</a> of this work drew <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/d1810538-9b4c-7f19-852f-7f6d255533c7@redhat.com/">some
questions</a> about whether the added 
complexity was worth it (and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YolHr1GwfA++i9jj@casper.infradead.org/">a side
discussion</a> on better alternatives to <tt>fork()</tt>).  There have been
few responses to the current version, but it seems likely that this
discussion has not yet reached its conclusion.
<p>
<h4>Working-set estimation</h4>
<p>
A process's "working set" is the subset of its pages that it is actually
using at any given time.  Identifying the working set is a key part of
effective memory management; if a process's working set can be kept in RAM,
that process will perform much better than if it must continually fault
pages in from 
secondary storage.  Giving a process more memory than is needed to hold the
working set, though, is wasteful.  So a lot of effort goes into trying to
give each process just enough memory â€” but not too much.
<p>
In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221214225123.2770216-1-yuanchu@google.com/">this
patch set</a>, Yuanchu Xie notes that the multi-generational LRU (MGLRU)
work that 
was merged for the 6.1 kernel provides much of the infrastructure needed to create
better working-set-size estimates.  The MGLRU organizes a process's pages
into "generations", with recently-used pages being placed into the youngest
generation.  Over time, unused pages age into the older generations, until
they are eventually reclaimed.
<p>
The working set should thus be found in the youngest generations.  The only
problem is that the generational aging does not happen on any sort of set
schedule; instead, it is done when memory pressure increases and the kernel
needs to find pages to reclaim.  As a result, the younger generations can
accumulate pages that have not been used in some time, while pages that are
part of the working set may remain stuck in the older generations; this
situation can persist for some time if memory pressure is not high.
<p>
As a way of getting better working-set-size estimates out of the MGLRU, Xie
adds a new mechanism to force aging to happen regularly.  It takes the form
of a new knob, <tt>memory.periodic_aging</tt>, that is implemented in the
memory control-group controller, but for the root group only.  It holds the
aging interval in seconds; setting it to a non-zero value will enable
periodic MGLRU aging system-wide.  There is a new kernel thread, called
<tt>kold</tt>, that does this aging work.
<p>
If <tt>memory.period_aging</tt> is set to, for example, 60&nbsp;seconds,
then the youngest generation for any process should contain the pages that
are known to have been used within the last minute, while the
second-youngest generation will hold pages that have been idle for more
than one minute, but less than two.  The kernel could use this information
to adjust the amount of memory available to each process, but it could also
be of use to user-space memory-management mechanisms.  Processes could 
use their own working-set information to optimize their behavior and avoid
using more memory than is available to them.
<p>
Before user space can use this information, though, it needs to be made
available, which is not currently the case.  So the patch set adds another
memory-controller file called <tt>memory.page_idle_age</tt> to export
generational data to user space.  Reading this file will produce a table
with counts of the number of pages in each of a set of fixed age ranges
(ranging from one second to just over one hour), with separate lines for
file-backed and anonymous pages.  This information seems like it could be
useful in a number of situations, including simply better understanding how
the generational-aging algorithm is working.
<p>
This patch series is on its first posting, and has not yet drawn any review
comments.  It is far less invasive than the other patches examined here
and seems like it should be less controversial.  If nothing else,
though, this work could benefit from some documentation so that potential
users of the new functionality do not need to reverse-engineer its
interface from the source.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes, I noticed that. :-) The question stands though: in most other cases, performance optimizations don't have to be individually enabled. (Is there a prctl for folios or EAS?) I understand that the patch currently regresses performance in some use cases, but that's just a signal to me that it's not yet ready. Ideally, the system would tune itself. If it can't --- because the kernel doesn't have enough information to know what a process is going to do --- then the prctl or personality flag or whatever should provide the missing information to the kernel at a high level, not act as a low level toggle for an implementation detail of the mm subsystem.<br>

The working set work focuses on understanding the usage pattern of a workload, per page type and per NUMA node, with granularity in minutes. It should also have low enough overhead that it doesn't impact application performance by much (to be evaluated), and could be turned on for most latency tolerant workloads to aid proactive reclaim.<br>
<p>
The parallel in Brendan Gregg's WSS would be idle page tracking, which tracks accesses by setting and checking the PG_idle bit. The benefit here is that MGLRU already does almost all of this during aging, and is less clunky than userspace writing to /sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap.<br>
<p>
With DAMON, you can get a lot more, e.g. a heatmap, but there's additional work and tuning required to make use of it. The working set extensions are really about exposing information MGLRU already has.<br>

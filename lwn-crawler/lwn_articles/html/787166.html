<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2019/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
James Bottomley began his talk at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM) by noting that the main opposition to his ideas
was not present at the summit, which was likely to mean the ideas got a much
easier reception than they would have otherwise.  In particular, Peter
Zijlstra and Ingo Molnar expressed some strong reservations to the work
that Bottomley's colleague Mike Rapoport <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1556228754-12996-1-git-send-email-rppt@linux.ibm.com/">posted</a>
recently; none of those three were in attendance at LSFMM.  The idea is to
use address spaces to reduce the attack surface available to virtual
machines (VMs) and containers such that kernel bugs of various sorts have
less reach on multi-tenant systems.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley has been working with  Rapoport on the idea for
the container use case, but there are others, from Google and Oracle, who
are trying to solve the same problems for VMs.  Address spaces are the
oldest and most secure mechanism for keeping tenants separate from one
another, he said.  Separating processes into their own address spaces is
what was used to support multi-user systems, so there is around 50 years of
history there.  Part of the reason to extend the idea for VMs and
containers is that address spaces have proven to work well as a security measure.
</p>

</a>

<p>
For a KVM system, the security of the guest OS depends on the fact that the
hypercalls make up a pretty tiny footprint within the host kernel.  That
interface is all that the guest OS has access to in the host.  Prior to
Spectre and Meltdown, that boundary would be enough for security but now
programs can observe what others are doing using the flaws.  So KVM developers would
like to find ways to ensure that the guest cannot access anything else in
the host kernel (even speculatively) by unmapping its code and by not
providing access to the 
address space of its data.
</p>

<p>
Moving on to containers, he said that one of the big problems in container
security is the kernel footprint that containers use.  In the simplest
case, containers have access to the entire system-call interface of the
kernel, which means they are exposed to a "broad swath of the kernel".  If
you listen to VM people, he said, they will claim that the access to all of
the 360 or so system calls is what makes containers inherently far less secure
than VMs.  But if you <a href="/Articles/773976/">measure what is actually
being used</a> by containers, "that is bollocks"; generic containers are
something like two to five times less secure than hypervisors (in terms of
the amount of kernel code traversed), not the hundreds of times that VM
proponents like to suggest.
</p>

<p>
There is a "semantic gap" between the system calls that a guest VM can make
and the code that actually gets executed in the host kernel.  The security
of VMs is partly based on the fact that it is actually difficult to create
an exploit at the system-call level that will translate across the
hypercalls into the host kernel.  So there is lots of exposed code in the
guest OS, but a great deal less in the host OS because of the hypervisor
interface.  Container developers would like to get back the properties that
the semantic gap provides, without reverting to having the gap itself,
since it is the lack of this gap that gives containers much of their power.
</p>

<p>
But in order to reduce the kernel footprint, projects like <a
href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a> and  <a
href="https://nabla-containers.github.io/">Nabla Containers</a> create
sandboxes to handle some of the kernel work in user space.  For gVisor, the
kernel calls have been rewritten in Go, while Nabla Containers took the
approach of reducing the projection of the containers into the kernel by
restricting which system calls can be made and emulating the rest in user space.
</p>

<p>
The price for those approaches is a "massive semantic gap", he said.  It
has high security properties, but it causes problems for memory management
and elsewhere.  He is looking to thin out the sandbox; ideally via separate
address spaces for each container or VM.  If every kernel namespace could
have objects that were private to that namespace, that would go a long way
toward solving this problem, he said.  It is primarily a protection for
multi-tenant systems, so he is not suggesting that the feature would be
turned on everywhere. 
</p>

<p>
Trond Myklebust asked how these ideas differed from a microkernel
architecture.  In a microkernel, the filesystem driver and the block device
driver would each be in their own address spaces, Bottomley said, so
sharing filesystems between containers would be
problematic because the two containers would be accessing the same
filesystem address space.  What he is looking for is to separate address spaces on a
per-tenant basis, not per subsystem. 
</p>

<p>
Another attendee noted that in a microkernel, a fault in the filesystem
driver, for example, only affects that component, not the rest of the
system.  The architecture will make it difficult to separate a shared
filesystem and all of its data structures; it is a question of which
resources you are protecting.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley believes that two unrelated containers sharing a filesystem is a
niche use case in the cloud.  Since most don't do it, we can afford to make
them pay a huge penalty when they do, he said.  In terms of fault isolation, a
microkernel will simply restart a failing driver, but what is needed in the
multi-tenant case is to kill the tenant that caused the fault.   The idea
is to punish a malicious tenant.  The difference is that a microkernel
provides an address space per subsystem, while he is looking for an address
space per tenant; the design goals and security properties are different in
the two cases.
</p>

<p>
The question of performance was raised; can the performance that will be
lost by doing this address-space separation ever be recovered?  Bottomley
believes that it is a hardware problem.  He noted that virtualization was slow
initially, so the hardware vendors stepped up to make it faster; the same
could happen here.  Beyond that, this feature is for security; anything
is acceptable in the name of security, he (half) joked.
</p>

<p>
Matthew Wilcox said that he did not buy the semantic gap argument.  He
noted that in a previous life as a Java programmer he had a colleague who
was able to accidentally corrupt the BIOS in his machine with a Java
program.  Bottomley agreed; the semantic gap argument is a form of security
through obscurity, he said.  There are two main approaches to providing
security for containers: either guarding against malicious system calls,
which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, or emulating system calls in user space.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the shared-filesystem question, Ted Ts'o noted that often the
base images for containers (such as RHEL) are shared.  Bottomley said that
typically those are shared in a read-only fashion, which is a solved
problem.  Read-only pages in the page cache can be shared, but sharing
read-write pages is not a common cloud-container pattern.

I don’t expect hardware to accelerate these address space tricks. Instead, I expect hardware to help with control flow integrity. Intel’s upcoming CET will do this via “shadow stacks”, and I don’t see why one would want to use the types of proposed tricks on a CPU with CET.<br>

Was CET improved since nearly three years ago, when PaXTeam dissected what was announced and found it pretty limited ( <a href="https://grsecurity.net/effectiveness_of_intel_cet_against_code_reuse_attacks.php">https://grsecurity.net/effectiveness_of_intel_cet_against...</a> ) ? Even if it was, it's going to be a while before most x86_64 cores in the real world have it - just like SMAP. Further dwarfing the impact of CET is the fact that there are more non-x86_64 cores than x86_64 cores in the wild, though the server market, which is increasingly running container-based workloads, keeps using mostly x86_64 cores, for various reasons...<br>
<p>
Of course, PaX's RAP, despite being effectively open source in the PaX/grsecurity patch - both the latest official public one from April 2017 and the leaked tree from late 2018 - is definitely trademarked and also maybe successfully patented by now, so while outdated versions thereof can be independently benchmarked and examined (with some elbow grease), it's not a practical solution for nearly anyone...<br>

The part of CET I'm talking about is the shadow stack part, which is really quite strong.  And the "SCI" proposal, as far as I know, is even weaker than CET in controlling the targets of indirect branches and calls.<br>

So yes, I stand by my assertion that, as far as I can tell, CET is strictly stronger than SCI.<br>

I am not sure whether this is a problem. If I read the article correctly (and understand correctly what a pod is, as I do not have experience with kubernetes), this would not match the use case that unrelated containers share a filesystem, exactly because the containers are related. According to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/</a>, containers within a pod share the namespaces. So they would not be put into different address spaces anyway. If I understand correctly, the proposed patch would be used to separate different pods, which are not expected to share a writeable filesystem.<br>

Regarding syscall surface area, I would really like it if vanilla Linux adopted the idea from the mobile/web/OpenBSD world of declaring needed permissions up front.<br>
<p>
One of the frequent criticisms I see of seccomp-based security is that it can't come close to pledge's ease of use because it can't know which libc calls map to which syscalls. That information could easily be gathered at compile time though: if it were the norm for GCC to annotate all ELF files with a map of syscalls they're going to invoke, things like firejail and whatever the enterprise world uses this week would be much easier to set up. It'll probably only work when the call chain and syscall number can be statically determined at compile time, but I'd argue anything else is a code smell.<br>

You'll very likely find code in glibc where the syscall numbers aren't known at compile time because the syscall being used depends on the capabilities of the running kernel.<br>
<p>
OTOH, this "syscall surface area" is just a completely bizarre metric. Not all syscalls are equal to each other. The implementation of the pause system call is certainly a lot simpler than that of sendfile syscall. The same goes for the idea of working around unknown/ hypothetical kernel bugs by using sime kind of not exactly trivial middleware whose unknown/ hypothetical bugs don't matter because 'we' prefer not to think about them, as we otherwise couldn't "sell" our non-solution.<br>

Considering that dynamic linking exists, the code which will be executed at some specific time isn't even known at compile time. Even if it was, the compiler would need to determine all possible runtime code paths. This ought to solve the halting problem as a side effect :-).<br>

That's fine. Just save your syscall lists in an ELF section. Then the sandbox can make the list of all calls from all linked libraries.<br>
<p>
This won't cover dlopen() dependencies, but not much software that people would like to sandbox actually uses dlopen().<br>
<p>
The idea here is not to create a 100% foolproof solution, but provide an easy to use mitigation mechanism for potential breaches. OpenBSD did it right with pledge().<br>

The problem is that the C library is one of those linked libraries. Hence, this list would contain pretty much all system calls unless an exhaustive pre-execution analysis of the code which will be executed can be used to limit this set to the actually needed ones. I'm usually critical of OpenBSD but they're certainly competent programmers. Hence, they didn't even try to go down this way.<br>
<p>
Such a mechanism, however implemented, still wouldn't be particularly useful, because the code implementing it can contain unknown, exploitable bugs as well. Directing energies towards finding and fixing real bugs makes more sense and then spending time on "miracle cures" whose usefulness is mainly "enables someone to sleep soundly despite ...".<br>

libc has to be treated specially. Perhaps with annotations for each symbol, rather than the overall code. Per-symbol annotations won't really work for larger libraries as you'd have to analyze transitive dependencies between functions, but libc is fairly simple.<br>
<p>
A full-scale pledge() would work better (hey, LSM folks, are you here?!?) but the only workable mechanism in Linux right now is BPF-based seccomp.<br>

But the C library isn't special. It's just another library. For additional complications, other code usually doesn't do direct syscalls at al but calls C library function which might or might not end up doing a or some syscalls. The idea might seem simple, but this is a non-starter.<br>
<p>
Considering that it's also still completely useless save as psychological band-aid, there's no reason to worry about this. This whole "Security by making it more complicated!"-approach is completely misguided. There is no miracle cure here, despite there's no shortage of people trying to sell miracle cures. As someone put it on some web site a long time ago: "If you want security, you do code audits".<br>

Quite. Also, glibc calls dlopen() under the covers, incurring all the problems you noted that dlopen() causes for this scheme: when you do a name lookup, say, or a getent, or any other service lookup (including user dbs, etc), or when you do an iconv(). This means that, yes, a hello world program that does nothing but a printf() could perfectly well invoke dlopen(), even when statically linked. Sure, it can only dlopen() stuff that's mentioned in /etc/nsswitch.conf or in the iconv modules dirs, but isn't that rather too much special-casing for an allegedly-general security scheme?

Meltdown is just a bug, but the Spectre class of issues is a pretty fundamental consequence of an optimisation technique that CPUs have relied on for decades. I don't think it's apparent that it can ever be fixed in hardware, without an unacceptably massive performance regression.<br>

Non-speculatively executing ready-to-run instructions in other threads will also provide a lovely performance boost, without allowing one to build a predictable side channel in your own thread.  In part this has been done, and I suspect that others are happily copying the idea as we speak (;-))<br>

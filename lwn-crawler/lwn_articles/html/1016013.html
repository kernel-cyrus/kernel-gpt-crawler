Address-space isolation may well be, as Brendan Jackman said at the
beginning of his memory-management-track session at the 2025 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, "<q>some security
bullshit</q>".  But it also holds the potential to protect the kernel from
a wide range of vulnerabilities, both known and unknown, while reducing the
impact of existing mitigations.  Implementing address-space isolation with
reasonable performance, though, is going to require some significant
changes.  Jackman was there to get feedback from the memory-management
community on how those changes should be implemented.

<p>
The core idea behind address-space isolation (last <a
href="/Articles/1014440/">covered here</a> in March), he began, is to run
as much kernel code as possible in an address space where sensitive data is
unmapped, and thus invisible to speculative-execution vulnerabilities.  It
is like the kernel page-table isolation that was <a
href="/Articles/741878/">introduced</a> in response to the Meltdown
hardware vulnerability, but with a higher degree of protection.  Kernel
page-table isolation created a new address space with most of the kernel
removed; the new work adds a restricted address-space that has holes in it
where only the sensitive data has been removed.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016018/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/BrendanJackman-sm.png" alt="[Brendan Jackman]"
title="Brendan Jackman" class="rthumb"></a>

The address-space isolation patches are deployed on a significant subset of
Google's fleet, he said.  Their current (public) form can be seen in <a
href="/ml/all/20250110-asi-rfc-v2-v2-0-8419288bc805@google.com/">this patch
set</a> posted in January.  This version adds protection from bare-metal
attackers, while previous versions had only protected the kernel from
virtual machines.  There are still two blockers that need to be addressed
though.  One is a better design for page allocation — the intended topic
for this session — while the other is a 70% degradation in file-<span class="nobreak">I/O</span>
performance.
<p>
In order for the kernel to unmap memory containing sensitive data, it needs
to know where that memory is, so kernel code must indicate sensitivity at
allocation time by way of a new <tt>__GFP_SENSITIVE</tt> flag.  There are
some performance considerations here; for example, mapping pages may
require first zeroing them, since they may have previously contained
sensitive data.  He would also like to avoid fragmenting the kernel's
direct map if possible.  Mike Rapoport, who has <a
href="/Articles/931406/">analyzed the cost of direct-map fragmentation</a>,
said that it is best avoided if possible, but is not that critical.
<p>
Avoiding fragmentation, Jackman continued, requires grouping nonsensitive
pages together in physical memory.  He also preallocates page tables for
restricted data down to the PMD (2MB) level, and maps or unmaps entire 2MB
page blocks at one time.  That helps to minimize fragmentation and
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) invalidations.
<p>
The patch set adds two new migration types to distinguish sensitive and
non-sensitive data, and a new constraint that disallows the allocation of
pages across the two sensitivity types.
<p>
There are some challenges that come with unmapping page blocks while
allocating memory.  The unmapping requires a TLB invalidation, but that
cannot be done while the zone lock (needed to allocate the page block) is
held.  The invalidation must be done, though, before other CPUs are allowed
to see the block as being sensitive.  So the current code allocates the
entire page block, even if only one page is needed, releases the zone lock,
performs the invalidation, then reacquires the zone lock.  After that, the
memory can be marked sensitive and any unneeded pages can be freed.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
That technique works, but leads to a possible worrisome scenario.  If all
CPUs on the system decide to allocate a sensitive page at the same time,
they will all end up doing the above dance, and they will all hammer each
other with TLB invalidations.  Jackman said that he is not sure that this
case is worth optimizing for, but Matthew Wilcox said that database
workloads could possibly act in just that way.
<p>
Mapping a block while allocating is easier, Jackman said; it is just a
matter of populating the page tables and changing the migration type of the
affected memory.  It is essentially a normal case of migration-type
fallback.  But pages that might have held sensitive data have to be zeroed
to prevent the possible exposure of that data; he wondered if the allocator
should just zero pages unconditionally.  The cost of doing so, he said, is
not that bad.  Jason Gunthorpe said, though, that zeroing can indeed be
painful on systems with slower memory, and Suren Baghdasaryan said that
there had once been a maple-tree performance regression caused by page
zeroing.
<p>
If the zeroing overhead is too much, Jackman continued, then the allocator
will have to repeat the unmapping dance described above, or handle zeroing
one page at a time, using a page flag.  Somebody asked what the performance
of the allocator was at Google; Jackman said that it worked well, but the
version of address-space isolation running there does things differently
than the version that has been posted for upstream consideration.
<p>
Wilcox asked if the kernel's Spectre mitigations can be safely disabled
once address-space isolation is in use.  For now, Jackman said, the
isolation only protects user-space pages; the task of marking kernel
allocations for sensitivity is far from complete.  Once that has been done,
it should be possible to turn off the mitigations, and to never need
another one again.  The mitigations are off at Google, and the patch yields
a performance gain overall.
<p>
Since he had some time at the end of the session, Jackman launched into the
problem of the file-<span class="nobreak">I/O</span> performance regression caused by address-space
isolation.  The problem is that all file pages are marked sensitive within
the kernel, so every read causes a fault and an address-space transition.  It
is pointless to protect pages that a process is about to read anyway, but
the page cache as a whole cannot be marked non-sensitive since it likely
contains data that any given process cannot access.  Earlier versions of
the patch set had a separate "local nonsensitive" marker for data that
processes could leak to themselves but, even with that, the kernel does not
know at allocation time where file pages should be mapped.
<p>
Thus, he said, the kernel needs a process-local mapping for file pages.
One solution would be to map entire files when a process opens them; that
is relatively easy, but it is harder to know when to unmap file data.  A
process can lose access to a file in a number of ways; a security module
might change its mind, or <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html">fanotify</a>
permission events can revoke access, for example.  There must also be
action taken when file pages are removed from the cache, either
through reclaim or because a file is truncated.
<p>
The alternative, he said, is ephemeral, per-CPU mappings that are in place
only as long as the operation is ongoing.  Once the operation completes,
the page tables would be torn down right away, but the TLB flush could be
deferred to minimize the performance impact.
<p>
At that point, the session was truly out of time and the discussion ended
with no conclusions on the file-<span class="nobreak">I/O</span> problem.

These seem unrelated to me, if I understand correctly? ASI is to protect against speculation revealing the contents of memory holding sensitive data. ASLR (userspace and KASLR) seems mostly useful for protecting the addresses of code, when you already know what code is there (the source code and compiled versions are public) and you want to arrange your return address in the stack or some function pointer to point to particular known code that acts as a useful gadget. So you're not interested in hiding the actual contents of memory, just the assignment of which address has that contents.<br>

Yeah they're kinda orthogonal tools for security. <br>
<p>
BTW, if it KASLR gets meaningfully in your way, IMO you should just switch it off. It's a road-bump to slow attackers down, it doesn't actually create any new security boundary or have any fundamental theoretical benefit. It's a kinda economic lever - it makes life Y% more difficult for the attacker and X% more difficult for the defender. If Y isn't significantly higher than X for your usecase, I'd say you should drop it.<br>

      <p>Not totally: with ASLR, pages mapped from insensitive files become sensitive if they have dynamic relocations applied to them; without ASLR, maybe they (conceptually) don't.

<p>In practice, I assume that the copy-on-write triggered by ld.so's first write to such a page would mark the private copy as sensitive, and I guess the safest way to counter that is using a tool like <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/prelink/prelink.8.en.html">prelink(8)</a> to prevent the page getting modified (unless there's an address conflict)? That way, it still gets marked sensitive if it's not what most other processes see.

<p>(All of this is assuming some kind of "insensitive file" support exists, of course.)

Based on the article, they appear to be including all file blocks. That seems like a good starting point, but there are a number of other things that are "obviously" at least as sensitive as file blocks:<br>
<p>
* All components of the RNG state (especially the entropy pool).<br>
* memfds, pipe buffers, etc., basically anything where you're holding userspace's data for a little while.<br>
* Drivers?<br>
<p>
OTOH, if something is routinely displayed in e.g. top(1) without anyone getting upset about it being visible (PIDs, command lines, resource metrics, etc.), then it's probably not sensitive. I imagine that makes most if not all of the scheduler non-sensitive by extension (but I could be mistaken).<br>

Yeah, it's tricky.<br>
<p>
All the code I've posted so far just says everything allocated as GFP_USER is sensitive. So, not just file pages but also all anonymous user pages are sensitive. This already goes a pretty long way (it certainly adds a huge amount of extra engineering work for an attacker starting from a pre-ASI exploit) but as you've pointed out there are obvious things that it doesn't include that need to be protected. The other classic example to my mind is stuff copied into the kernel stack from userspace/VM guests.<br>
<p>
In principle we should be able to flip this question on its head and instead make the question "what _isn't_ sensitive", i.e. isntead of marking stuff as __GFP_SENSITIVE with the default being unprotected (we call this "denylist"), we could protect erverything by default and mark exceptions as __GFP_NONSENSITIVE (we call this "allowlist"). So far the general feeling has been that it's more practical to start from something that people can actually deploy and evaluate without worrying about an unpredictable performance disaster. But we could certainly switch to an allowlist model later down the line, it would make good sense to me.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 5, 2021</br>
           </div>
The addition of system calls to the Linux kernel is a routine affair; it
happens during almost every merge window.  The removal of system calls,
instead, is much more uncommon.  That appears likely to happen
soon, though, as discussions proceed on the removal of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bdflush.2.html"><tt>bdflush()</tt></a>.
Read on for a look at the purpose and history of this obscure system call and to
learn whether you will miss it (you won't).
<p>
Linux, like most operating systems, buffers filesystem I/O through
memory; a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html"><tt>write()</tt></a>
call results in a memory copy into the kernel's 
page cache, but does not
immediately result in a write to the underlying block storage device.  This
buffering is necessary for writes of anything other than complete blocks;
it is also important for filesystem performance.  Deferring block writes
can allow operations to be coalesced, provide opportunities for better
on-disk file layout, and enables the batching of operations.
<p>
Buffered file data cannot be allowed to live in memory forever, though;
eventually the system must arrange for it to be flushed back to disk.
Even the 0.01 Linux release included a version of the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync.2.html"><tt>sync()</tt></a>
system call, which forces all cached filesystem data to be written out.
While the kernel would flush some buffers when the buffer cache (which
preceded the page cache and was
a fixed-size array at that time) filled up, there was no provision for regularly
ensuring that all buffers were pushed out to disk.  That task was, if your
editor's memory serves, handled by a user-space process that would
occasionally wake up and call <tt>sync()</tt>.
<p>
There are advantages to handling this task in the kernel, though; it has a
much better idea of the state of both the buffer cache and the underlying
devices.  As a step in that direction, the <tt>bdflush()</tt> system call
was added to the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?h=0.99.14y&id=f614125ef74543bd223366c0c0d2a29be658b78e">0.99.14y
release</a> on February&nbsp;2, 1994.  (This was <a
href="http://web.soccerlab.polymtl.ca/ser-repos/public/data-sets/linux-kernels/kernel-history/1994.html">a 
different era</a> of kernel development; the preceding 0.99.14x release came
out seven hours earlier, and 0.99.14z came out nine hours later).  That
implementation was not particularly useful, though; all it did was return a
"not implemented" error.  An actual <tt>bdflush()</tt> implementation was
not added until the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?h=1.1.3&id=7450aa7e680c0037033c4f4e5746c66738c727ca">1.1.3
development kernel</a> in April 1994.
<p>
It must be said that <tt>bdflush()</tt> was a strange system call.  It was
defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    int bdflush(int func, long data);
</pre>
<p>
If <tt>func</tt> was zero, <tt>bdflush()</tt> would never return; instead,
it would loop within the kernel, occasionally flushing out dirty buffers.
In essence, a user-space process would become the kernel buffer-flushing
thread by making that call; these were the days before proper kernel
threads, after all.  Passing <tt>func</tt> as one would cause some buffers
to be flushed immediately.  Higher values of <tt>func</tt> would either
read or write the value of a control parameter for the flushing thread;
these included the percentage of dirty buffers needed to activate flushing,
the number of blocks to write in each cycle, etc.
<p>
While <tt>bdflush()</tt> was an improvement, there were a number of
problems with it as well.  One of those was that it relied on user space
for a critical kernel function; if no process ever set itself up with
<tt>bdflush()</tt>, or if that process were killed, bad things would
happen.  In the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?h=1.3.50&id=22accfc2b4fe4bc6a635c70c1a05a9a80abc81ea">1.3.50
development release</a> (December 1995), the kernel was
changed to automatically create a kernel thread (something it could do at
that point) to do the flushing work.  User space could still call
<tt>bdflush()</tt> to tweak the various parameters, but an attempt to run
as the flushing daemon would turn into an immediate call to
<tt>exit()</tt>; that caused the update process started by older init
systems to "work", avoiding boot-time unhappiness.
<p>
Another problem with <tt>bdflush()</tt> — or, more specifically, with the
underlying implementation — since the beginning is that it was a single
thread.  As Linux grew 
in popularity and found itself on bigger systems, that single thread became
an increasingly severe bottleneck.  If you have a number of drives on a
system, it will eventually take multiple threads to keep them all busy.
Thus Andrew Morton replaced the remaining <tt>bdflush()</tt> infrastructure
entirely in 2002 for the <a
href="https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/ChangeLog-2.5.8">2.5.8
development kernel</a>; in its place was a new 
set of kernel threads called <tt>pdflush</tt>.  Each <tt>pdflush</tt>
thread was dedicated to a separate physical drive, providing a much-needed
scalability improvement.
<p>
In December 2002, Morton merged a patch from Robert Love formally
deprecating the <tt>bdflush()</tt> system call, promising that it
"<q>will be removed in a future kernel</q>".  The <tt>pdflush</tt>
threads were <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d0bceac747b5">removed in
2009</a>  (for <a href="/Articles/364928/">2.6.32</a>) in favor of a rather
more 
elaborate, workqueue-based, writeback-control mechanism; those can still be
seen in the form of kernel threads with names like
<tt>kworker/u8:3-flush-259:0</tt>.  Meanwhile, though, <tt>bdflush()</tt>
lives on in current kernels, even though it has not done anything for many
years.
<p>
Now, however, Eric Biederman is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87sg10quue.fsf_-_@disp2133/">proposing</a> to remove
<tt>bdflush()</tt> entirely as part of a larger project he has to rework
the kernel's <tt>exit()</tt> code.  Given that this system call does
nothing, was never widely used in the first place, and has been deprecated
for nearly 19&nbsp;years, one might confidently conclude that there are no
users left.  As it turns out, though, Geert Uytterhoeven <a
href="/ml/linux-arch/CAMuHMdXSU6_98NbC1UWTT_kmwxD=6Ha5LJxFAtbSuD=y78nASg@mail.gmail.com/">has
an old m68k image</a> that he occasionally boots, presumably on days when
he is overcome with nostalgia.  Michael Schmitz <a
href="/ml/linux-arch/36123b5d-daa0-6c2b-f2d4-a942f069fd54@gmail.com/">demonstrated</a>,
though, that said image still boots successfully in the absence of
<tt>bdflush()</tt>, so it is not an impediment to the system call's
removal.
<p>
There are no other known users of <tt>bdflush()</tt> out there, so there
would appear to be nothing preventing this removal from happening.  At that
point, it will be the first system call removed since late 2019, when
<tt>sysctl()</tt> was deleted — by the same Eric Biederman.  It would be
surprising to see that happen in 5.14, though, given how recently this
patch was posted. This system call has endured for almost
19&nbsp;years after it ceased to be useful; keeping it for another two
months until 5.15 does not seem like much of an imposition.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

If Linux really believes in &quot;compatibility forever&quot; then the syscall number should not be re-used for any purpose, and any actual attempt to invoke it should return -ENOSYS.  I looked at Biederman&#x27;s patch.  There is no remark about such a cleanup, and no obvious code that does so.  Even if the patch does result in the proper cleanup, it still would be appropriate to document explicitly.<br>

All the syscall tables have been updated as follows (or similar):<br>
<p>
-114	common	bdflush				sys_bdflush<br>

According to the patch, the current version of bdflush calls exit when func == 1, not when func == 0 as this article (and the manpage) seems to imply would make sense. And it seems like it&#x27;s been that way since, at least, v2.6.12 (the first version released using Git). So I think the compatibility layer for userspace bdflush daemons never worked, right?<br>

<p>It's ugly but I'm sure it worked because it <em>had</em> to work when it was introduced. Also bear in mind that the different functions (daemon, flush-some, and tunables) were removed in stages. Had they been removed at the same time, probably the behaviour would be a bit different.</p>

<p>The existing callers that passed func &lt;= 0 would presumably exit if it ever returned, so there was no need for a forceable exit.</p>

<p>The existing callers that passed func == 1 would presumably do so in an infinite loop (with a sleep). So these were completely unnecessary processes that could be cleaned up with a forceable exit.</p>

&quot;Another problem with bdflush() — or, more specifically, with the underlying implementation — since the beginning is that it was a single thread. [...] Each pdflush thread was dedicated to a separate physical drive, providing a much-needed scalability improvement.&quot;<br>
<p>
Maybe in 2002 that was worth something. However, we have been limited in writeback performance since the start of the SSD era (i.e. since ~2008) or so by having only a single flusher thread per physical block device. Writeback, especially with the delayed allocation design XFS, ext4, btrfs and other modern filesystems have, hits single CPU usage limits long before SSDs hit their hardware capability limits. <br>

<i><b>"That task was, if your editor's memory serves, handled by a user-space process that would occasionally wake up and call sync()."</b></i><br/><br/>

I still type <i>sync</i> occasionally.  Usually after a dd session to a USB stick and I can't be arsed to grab the mouse and find the widget, right click and "safely remove" or whatever it is called.  Sometimes I even <i>eject</i> the device first before whipping it out <sup>*</sup>. <br/><br/>

You don't get more user-space than that!  I'm probably not alone either. <br/><br/>

Question, please:<br>
So does the userspace sync command do anything at all?<br>
<p>
A long time ago, I was told that one always says:<br>
   sync; sync; sync<br>
on a multi-user Unix (there were no desktops) to move other people&#x27;s data closer to the end of the line, so that my data would fall off onto the disk.<br>

<p>
sync (the command) seems like it calls sync() by default: <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/sync.c">https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/...</a><br>
<p>
And I didn&#x27;t know before I looked at the source that you could specify a file, but that is neat.<br>

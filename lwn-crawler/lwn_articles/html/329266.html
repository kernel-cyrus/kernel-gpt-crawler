<p>

A vulnerability in <tt>udev</tt>, the user-space tool that manages the Linux
<tt>/dev</tt> tree, has left unpatched systems vulnerable to a local root
privilege escalation.  Exploits are already circulating on the
full-disclosure mailing list, so
it is rather important for users and administrators to update their
systems.  The problem was caused by the way <tt>udev</tt> processes the
messages it receives&mdash;certain kinds of messages, which could be
generated by user processes, were not considered.  That oversight led to
the vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
The ever-expanding nature of the <tt>/dev</tt> tree, along with the
rise of more
dynamic hardware environments, led to the creation of <tt>udev</tt> in
2003.  It replaced the <tt>devfs</tt> filesystem that was an earlier
attempt to solve those problems.  Unfortunately, <tt>devfs</tt>
codified device naming policy into the kernel&mdash;something
the kernel hackers try to avoid.  By moving those decisions to user space
with <tt>udev</tt>, that problem&mdash;along with a number of <a href="
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs">others</a>&mdash;was
resolved. 
</p>

<p>
In order for <tt>udevd</tt> (the <tt>udev</tt> daemon) to do its job, it
needs a way to be informed by the kernel when devices come and
go&mdash;typically because the user attached or detached some device.
A standard Linux way to send messages between the kernel and user space
is via a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink">netlink socket</a>. Netlink
sockets are an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that is geared for
kernel to user space (and vice versa) IPC.  It provides the well-understood
sockets API to user space programs and is a much more flexible IPC
mechanism than other possible choices.
</p>

<p>
One of the nice features of netlink sockets is the ability to multicast
messages (i.e. a message sent to multiple recipients).  Each netlink
protocol type can have up to 32 multicast groups 
associated with it.  Typically, multicast messages can only be sent and
received by root, though some netlink protocol types will allow non-root
processes to send and/or receive multicast messages.  In fact, a recent <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=d094cbe998eb566d47552aa9d3c26c9123a7b858">change</a>
to the kernel allows non-root processes to receive&mdash;but not
send&mdash;the <tt>udev</tt> 
multicast messages (which are also known as uevents).
</p>

<p>
Since only root processes can send the multicast uevents, it would seem
there is no hole to exploit.  Unfortunately, no one considered
<i>unicast</i> messages.  Any process can send a unicast netlink message to
any other process, just by addressing it to a particular <tt>pid</tt>.  It
is up to the recipient to decide whether to accept and process the
message.  Because these unicast messages fell through the cracks,
<tt>udevd</tt> would happily process them&mdash;creating devices as
specified by a potentially malicious user.  One of the more obvious exploits
would be to create world-writeable block device corresponding to the root
filesystem&mdash;other, nastier exploits are likely possible as well.
</p>

<p>
The fix was straightforward: enabling credentials (a header placed on each
message by the kernel that includes the <tt>uid</tt> and <tt>pid</tt> of
the sender) for the netlink socket, then requiring that all messages
received have a <tt>uid</tt> of zero, which Kay Sievers <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git;a=commitdiff;h=e2b362d9f23d4c63018709ab5f81a02f72b91e75">added</a>
on April 8.  Scott James Remnant <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git;a=commitdiff;h=e86a923d508c2aed371cdd958ce82489cf2ab615">added</a>
some additional checks shortly thereafter, requiring that messages received
are not unicast and have been sent by the kernel. 
</p>

<p>
Sievers says that either
patch "<q>alone would be sufficient</q>" to fix the problem and that
doing both is, in 
some sense, defensive programming.  The credentials check is needed for
upcoming changes, he said, and Remnant's checks will take care of a
theoretical concern: "<q>a confined
root process inside SELinux or AppArmor jail, which in fact is not
root in the usual sense, has no privileges, but could have the uid
0</q>".  While Sievers didn't think the theory was particularly viable,
checking for a sender <tt>pid</tt> of zero (as Remnant's change does) will
take care of that problem as well.
</p>

<p>
This vulnerability illustrates a fairly common mistake: not considering all
of the ways that input can reach a program.  Every input mechanism factors
into the "attack 
surface" of a program (or system).  In this case, messages that&mdash;up until
very recently at least&mdash;couldn't even be seen by non-root processes,
could be sent by them.  It is not uncommon for developers to focus on the
"normal" usage of an input mechanism and miss a lesser, but still valid, use.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to see that this vulnerability has a strange overlap with
the <a href="/Articles/328572/">capabilities flaw</a> we reported on last
week.  In both cases, an exploit would use a device node created by
<tt>mknod()</tt>, which is, itself, an uncommonly-used system call.  These
are the kinds of places that attackers are likely to focus their
efforts.  One hopes that other users of netlink sockets&mdash;routing
daemons, netfilter, firewall applications, and others&mdash;have examined
their code for similar problems.

      The Red Hat errata for this fix says:

<pre>
Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.
</pre>

Is that just the normal cop out, or are there any reasons to worry upgrading udev on a RHEL5u0 will break something.. ?

The most clever way to exploit this vulnerability is to leverage the fact that since udev 116, it is possible to specify a command to be run in the message sent via the netlink socket.<br>
<p>
So on udev &gt; 116, you have arbitrary command execution as root, for any users, 100% reliable, not arch specific.<br>

One of the most important vulnerabilities in years on GNU/Linux systems imho.<br>

Can anyone think of a reason why mknod() allows *anyone* to create device <br>
nodes outside /dev? (Or, more generally, why isn't a special mount option <br>
required to create device nodes on a filesystem? The ability to create <br>
device nodes absolutely anywhere is a 'feature' of Unix that I've never <br>
seen be of actual use to anyone except attackers.)<br>
<p>
This would have fixed the NFS problem, at least, although not the udev <br>
hole (as udev would have created the node in /dev, which would have had <br>
that flag...)<br>
<p>
(More evilly still, if you indicate this in the superblock and have it be <br>
set at mkfs time --- also not problematic for your average system with a <br>
tmpfs /dev --- this lets us recycle the now-unused st_rdev field in the <br>
inode for something else. Not a huge saving, true, but it *is* a saving, <br>
and there are a *lot* of inodes on your average system.)<br>

<p>Before there was kernel-level virtualization (vmware, xen, kvm, ...) there were partial virtualization environments which needed devices.  If you have a machine with trusted users only and/or global protection, then <tt>mknod()</tt> can be handy for experiments.

there is a mount option to deny the ability to use device nodes on a filesystem, but it's seldom used nowdays (the benifit from splitting up the filesystem into many slices is outweighed by the inconvienience of dealing with the many slices)<br>

 How would you ask ioctl like BLKBSZGET, BLKSSZGET, BLKGETSIZE,<br>
 BLKGETSIZE64, HDIO_GETGEO_BIG, to the file system which contains<br>
 a file given as parameter?<br>
 As an example:<br>
<a href="http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/gujin-2.5.tar.gz/gujin/showmap.c?extract=true">http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.n...</a><br>

 There is maybe a better solution (without having to guess the mount<br>
 point *name*) - I am listening...<br>

It's useful for chroot()ed filesystems or to fix /dev problems from another installation by mounting <br>

      No, that commit does what it says. The <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git;a=commit;h=e86a923d508c2aed371cdd958ce82489cf2ab615">commit that fixed this bug</a> was made by Scott James Remnant and has the subject "libudev: monitor - ignore messages from unusual sources". This is not entirely explicit, but it may not have immediately occurred to him that this was a severe security flaw. I can say that he was fairly quick to notify others about it.

      That is not true.  Go look at Kay's commit.  It adds the <tt>SO_PASSCRED</tt> option to the socket and adds an explicit check for <tt>(cred->uid != 0)</tt>.  As the LWN writeup indicated, 'either patch "alone would be sufficient" to fix the problem'.  

And your statement about him being quick to notify others is misleading at best.  There has <b>still</b> not been a single posting on the udev mailing list about this problem!

A few minor notes on netlink and this bug:<br>
<p>
- netlink supports 2^32-1 groups in recent kernel versions<br>
<p>
- the proper way to check that a message is from the kernel is to check for a PID of zero. Its also worth noting that netlink PIDs are just numerical identifiers with a badly chosen name, they have no direct relationship to process PIDs.<br>
<p>
- regarding other netlink users: the exactly same bug was present in iproute and IIRC the *swan keying daemons a couple of years ago. I'd expect it to be present in more software using netlink.<br>
<p>
Netlink for userspace to userspace communication seems like a pretty useless feature, unfortunately we can't remove it or require receiving processes to optionally enable it for compatibility reasons.<br>

<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
There are certain themes that recur regularly at the Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit; among the most reliable is
the scalability problems posed by the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> (formerly
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>) lock.  This topic has come up in (at least)
<a href="/Articles/548098/">2013</a>,
<a href="/Articles/753058/">2018</a> (<a
href="/Articles/753269/">twice</a>),
and <a href="/Articles/787629/">2019</a>.  The <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 event</a> was no
exception, with three consecutive sessions led by Liam Howlett, Michel
Lespinasse, and Suren Baghdasaryan
dedicated to the topic.  There are improvements on the horizon, but the problem
is far from solved.
<p>
Lespinasse started with an overview of the problem.
The <tt>mmap_lock</tt> is used to serialize changes to a process's address
space;  in that role, it can cause contention in a number of ways.  A
multi-threaded process that is generating a lot of page faults, for
example, will end up bouncing the lock's cache line around, even though
page faults only require a reader lock and can thus be handled in parallel.

<a href="/Articles/894082/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/MichelLespinasse-sm.png" alt="[Michel
Lespinasse]" title="Michel Lespinasse" class="rthumb"></a>

If the threads are performing other types of memory operations, such as
mapping or protection changes,
they may contend for <tt>mmap_lock</tt> and block each other more directly,
even if they are operating on different
parts of the address space and should be able to work concurrently.  There are
also problems when one process accesses another's address space; running
<tt>ps</tt> is a simple example.  Monitoring tools often run at a
relatively low priority; if one acquires the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> then is
scheduled out, it can end up blocking the application it is trying to
watch.
<p>
Lespinasse had been working on range locking for some time, with the
overall goal 
of splitting the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> into two parts.  There would be one
lock covering the entire address space that would be held only for short
periods, while range locks would be used for longer operations.  He
couldn't get it working well, though, mostly because it made page faults
more expensive.  So he has since turned his attention to the longstanding
<a href="/Articles/730531/">speculative page-fault handling patches</a>,
which should at least help with the cache-line bouncing problem, since they
eliminate the need to acquire <tt>mmap_lock</tt> much of the time.
<p>
Liam Howlett then briefly presented the maple tree work; this is a new data
structure that was described in detail in <a href="/Articles/845507/">this
2021 article</a>.  It is a parallel approach to the <tt>mmap_lock</tt>
scalability problem (and more).  The maple tree patches successfully
replace the current red-black tree for virtual memory areas with about
the same performance; in the future, maple trees should more naturally
support more scalable access to the process's address space.  Meanwhile,
the new data structure should be able to take much of the complexity out of
the memory-management subsystem.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox joined to note that, in the first phase, the maple tree does
not yet bring much in the way of scalability benefits.  The
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> is still being used in the same places, and the planned
ability to use read-copy-update (RCU) with maple trees is not yet there.  But it
is still a win even at this stage simply due to the reduction in
complexity.
<p>
<h4>The problem with page-fault handling</h4>
<p>
Wilcox continued by putting up an overview of how the page-fault handling
code works to demonstrate where the problems arise:
<p>
<pre>
    do_user_addr_fault();
    mmap_read_lock();
    find_vma();
    handle_mm_fault();
      __handle_mm_fault();
        p4d_alloc();
	pud_alloc();
	pmd_alloc();
	handle_pte_fault();
	  do_fault();
	    do_read_fault();
	      do_fault_around();
	        filemap_map_pages();
		  /* Stuff under RCU read lock */
    mmap_read_unlock();
</pre>
<p>
The point is all of the work done after the <tt>mmap_read_lock()</tt> call,
which acquires the <tt>mmap_lock</tt>.
The subsequent call to <tt>find_vma()</tt> will find the virtual memory
area (VMA) 
containing the faulting address, and the code requires that VMA to remain
stable thereafter — thus the acquisition of the lock.  Some of the calls
thereafter (the <tt>p?d_alloc()</tt> calls) may perform <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt>
allocations, meaning that they may sleep; that rules out using RCU rather
than taking the lock.  Once those functions have done their work, though,
RCU can be safely used.
<p>
Paul McKenney asked whether perhaps <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable
RCU (SRCU)</a> could be used here, especially if a variant could be made that
omitted the use of read-side barriers.  Wilcox said that SRCU has been
tried in the past and shown some performance problems, but things might be

<a href="/Articles/894083/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/LiamHowlett-sm.png" alt="[Liam Howlett]"
title="Liam Howlett" class="rthumb"></a>

better now.  McKenney said those problems are still present, but he might
be able to "contort the grace periods" to make things better.
<p>
Wilcox said that, instead, the <tt>p?d_alloc()</tt> functions could gain a
GFP-flags argument to tell them not to perform <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> allocations;
Michal Hocko replied that it might be necessary to dig into a lot of
architecture-specific code to make that work.  It would have been helpful
to have that argument from the beginning, he said, but it will be harder to
add now.  Johannes Wiener asked whether the flags argument was really
needed; perhaps the fault handler could just drop into a slow path if the
upper-level page directories are not present.
<p>
The conversation then shifted to the need to hold the lock to prevent
changes to the VMA in the first place.  The problem, in particular, is that
the VMA for a faulting address must continue to contain that address while
the fault 
is being handled; it cannot be allowed to shrink in a way that would leave
the address outside.  One way to avoid this problem would be to stop
changing the VMA in place; instead, it could be replaced using RCU.
Lespinasse asked what would happen if there were multiple changes
contending for access to the same VMA; it was suggested that a flag
indicating that changes are pending could be added.
<p>
The approach taken in the speculative page-fault patches is a little
different;  rather than using RCU, the code 
takes a <a href="/Articles/22818/">seqlock</a>.  If concurrent changes
happen while the fault is being handled, the code would simply start over
before committing the previous attempt.  This can, Wilcox said, be thought
of as 
spreading out changes in time, rather than spreading them out in space, as
is done by by the RCU approach.
<p>
Howlett, meanwhile, concluded that his maple tree work doesn't conflict
with either approach to page-fault handling.  A remaining problem, though,
is the need to preallocate memory — perhaps a fair amount of it — before
going into a non-sleepable mode.  Much of that memory may ultimately not
end up being used, but it must be available; all of this (often useless)
allocation and freeing is expensive.  It would be nice, Wilcox
said, to have a slab call to reserve some number of objects, with the
ability to release the unused ones later on.  "I'll just get Vlastimil
[Babka] to do it", he said.
<p>
Meanwhile, Lespinasse said, this topic has been under discussion for many
years; the speculative page fault patches go back to at least 2009.  It
is about time to start getting some of this code into the mainline.
<p>
Wilcox started to sketch out another variant on the approach.  The fault
code would, as a first attempt, avoid taking the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> and use
RCU for its concurrent updates.  If this fails, as it would if memory had
to be allocated, for example, then the code would just start over and retry
the old-fashioned way.  It would not be a huge change, he said, at least
for faults on file-backed pages.  There was some discussion over whether it
made sense to attempt to allocate memory (using <tt>GFP_NOWAIT</tt>) before
giving up on the fast path; Wilcox thinks there would be a benefit to
making the attempt.
<p>
Hocko asked whether this approach eliminated the need to do range locking,
especially once the maple tree is in place too.  Howlett answered that range
locking adds a lot of complexity, and it may well not be worthwhile.
<p>
Wilcox then suggested that a reader/writer semaphore could be put into the
VMA itself; that would have the effect of using the VMA as a sort of range
lock.  There would still be contention at the VMA level, but it would be an
improvement.  Developers could then iterate toward a better solution for as
long as the community is willing to put up with all the changes.  Mel
Gorman thought that the contention at the VMA level would be far less
severe than with the address-space-wide <tt>mmap_lock</tt>, but Wilcox
worried about applications that make terabyte-sized VMAs.  Gorman said that
applications creating that sort of VMA are almost certainly doing their own
memory management anyway.
<p>
The session concluded with the thought that some variant of the above approach might make
sense.  The proof is always in the code, though.
<p>
<h4>Speculative page faults for Android</h4>
<p>
The discussion on speculative page-fault handling was not done, though;
Baghdasaryan joined Lespinasse to shift the focus slightly.
Baghdasaryan pointed out that Android has a specific interest in
speculative page-fault handling because it improves the launch time for
applications — something that Android users care a lot about.  It is
important enough that vendors have been shipping it and have asked for it
to be included in the Android common kernel.  Multi-threaded applications
also benefit from it, he said.
<p>
Why are speculative page faults so helpful in these situations?  When
Android runs an app, it does so by spawning a new thread which typically
starts by mapping a number of VMAs.  As the app runs, those VMAs start
generating page faults, which create <tt>mmap_lock</tt> contention.
Eliminating that contention makes things run much faster.
<p>
The latest speculative page-fault patches were <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20220128131006.67712-1-michel@lespinasse.org/">posted in
January</a>, he continued.  One of the things holding them back is that few
benchmarks show the benefit of this work, and hackbench shows a 4%

<a href="/Articles/894084/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/SurenBaghdasaryan-sm.png" alt="[Suren
Baghdasaryan]" 
title="Suren Baghdasaryan" class="rthumb"></a>

regression.  That leads to pushback; few people outside of Android see the
value of this work.  Indeed, many do not know about it at all, so they
don't try it out, so there are no reports from use cases that it helps.
But everybody can see the added complexity and cost.
<p>
Beyond that, not everybody cares deeply about startup time.  Many server
applications run for a long time; the time it takes for them to get going
is insignificant in comparison.  Meanwhile, people who are affected by
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> contention have worked around the worst problems long
ago.

The end result of all this is that the speculative page-fault patches are
still being carried in the Android tree, with no clear prospect of going
upstream.  The Android developers would like to get this work merged, though;
the days when Android happily carried a big pile of out-of-tree patches are
past.  So, he asked, what is the best path forward?

<p>
Lespinasse said that he has seen a lot of people having <tt>mmap_lock</tt>
issues; they almost always find some sort of workaround and move on to the
next problem, but the issues are still there.  The problem is obviously not
impossible to deal with, but it is a source of frustration for users.  The
kernel should not impose this frustration; there are solutions out there,
and he wishes that something could go forward.
<p>
Hocko said that getting to a solution will still probably take some time.
Different approaches, including speculative page-fault handling and the
maple tree, will need to be evaluated; he is not sure that both are
required.  Lespinasse didn't see a conflict between the two, though; the
maple tree is a more efficient red-black tree, he said, but does not give
all of the benefits by itself.  McKenney suggested that it might make sense
to delay the lockless part of the maple-tree patches, giving the
speculative page-fault work a chance to show the benefits that it provides.
<p>
The session concluded with no firm outcomes.  Chances are, though, that
there will be a renewed round of patches showing up soon, and an increased
desire to get something upstream.  As Baghdasaryan noted, some of this work
has been ported forward and backward over many years and been widely tested
on a lot of devices.  This is not immature work; it should be possible to
get at least some of it merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

On x86 (and probably most or even all other architectures), the total memory that a page fault might need to allocate for page table filling purposes is bounded and quite small. It would seem entirely reasonable and not necessarily even particularly difficult for do_user_addr_fault to grab its five pages in advance and avoid GFP_KERNEL allocations. The only real issue is that the control flow is backwards - the actual peg table setup in called from driver code.<br>
<p>
We could perhaps have a per-task lookaside list for these pages, though, or a per-task “don’t-use-GFP_KERNEL” flag.<br>

By the time we call the driver, we already allocated all the way down to the PMD level, so that&#x27;s all fine.<br>

In my plan, drivers that want to opt into RCU page fault handling get to implement map_pages. Although the other MM developers have asked that we not do full RCU page fault handling until it&#x27;s proven necessary.<br>

<p>
When Android runs an app, it forks a new process from the zygote process. zygote contains an already stared Java VM including all the framework java libraries. Since fork() uses Copy-on-Write the parent and child process shared a lot of the memory pages. When the child starts to write to some of these shared pages, page faults occur, because the pages are mapped as read-only.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 9, 2016</br>
           </div>
Containers bring a lot of advantages in the areas of security and systems
administration; they can be used to run lightweight virtual "systems" in
isolation from each other and the host system.  Since containers lack their
own kernel — they run directly on the host-system kernel — one does not
ordinarily expect them to be built for an architecture other than the host
they are running on.  But it turns out that there are use cases for such
containers, and that they can be run using the
somewhat obscure "<tt>binfmt_misc</tt>" kernel mechanism if a small patch
set is applied.
<p>
<h4>binfmt_misc</h4>
<p>
When an executable file is provided to one of the <tt>exec*()</tt> system
calls, the kernel normally expects to find a native binary for the system
it is running on.  The kernel has long had a mechanism by which it can
recognize other executable-file formats and run them, though.  The classic
example is the module that looks for a file that begins with "<tt>#!</tt>"
— the marker for a shell script.  When such a file is recognized, the name
of the interpreter for the script will be read from the first line of the
file; the interpreter will then be run with the file as its standard
input.
<p>
But one can imagine many other possible formats for executable files.
These could be binaries built for a different operating system (DOS
binaries that could be run with DOSEMU, for example) or byte-code binaries
that need to run on a specific machine (such as Java byte code).  One could
try to code awareness of all these formats into the kernel, but that gets
unwieldy after a while.  It also lacks flexibility, which is unfortunate;
the kernel developers are never going to know about all of the possible
executable formats that might be of interest.
<p>
The obvious solution is to allow user space to describe new executable
formats to the kernel; that is the role of the <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>
mechanism.  If this feature is configured into the kernel (as it usually
is), a system administrator can add a new executable format by writing a
special string to <tt>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register</tt>.  That string
includes:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A way for the kernel to recognize the new format.  It can either be
     a particular file extension, or a "magic number" found near the
     beginning of the file.
<p>
<li> The name of the interpreter that is to be run to execute
     files with this format.
<p>
<li> Some flags that control how the <tt>argv</tt> array is created and,
     essentially, whether files in this format can be setuid or not.
</ul>
<p>
The full details of how it all works can be found in <a
href="/Articles/679310/"><tt>Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt</tt></a> in the
kernel source tree.
<p>
It is not hard to see how <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> can be used to run binaries
built for a different architecture.  It is a simple matter of describing
those binaries and naming an emulator (<a href="http://qemu.org/">QEMU</a>,
for example) that is able to 
run the binaries.  That works well for binaries to be run directly on the
host system, but it can be a bit more challenging to run a container that
is built for another architecture.
<p>
<h4>Architecture emulation in containers</h4>
<p>
The problem, as James Bottomley pointed out in <a
href="/Articles/679309/">this brief patch set</a>, is that
<tt>binfmt_misc</tt> has to locate and run the interpreter binary at the
time that the foreign binary is invoked.  This invocation happens within
the container, so the interpreter has to be visible in the container as
well, but, likely as not, the container is running within a namespace
intended to keep it from seeing the rest of the system.  As a result, the
interpreter must be placed inside the container itself.  That
complicates what would otherwise be containerized system built entirely for
the emulated architecture.  It also forces any orchestration system to be
aware of the emulation within the container and set things up accordingly,
making emulated containers less transparent than they would otherwise be.
<p>
The solution is to add a new mode for <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> wherein the
interpreter binary is opened by the kernel when the new format is initially
set up.  When a binary in that format is encountered, the already-opened
interpreter can be run, rather than seeking out and opening the interpreter
at that time.  This mechanism will work inside a container that otherwise
has no access to the interpreter; the kernel already has the interpreter
open, so it can run it directly.
<p>
This mode is set up by using the new "<tt>F</tt>" flag when describing the
format to <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  Once the kernel has opened the interpreter
file, it will keep it open until the format is removed.  That means that
updates to the interpreter binary will not take effect unless the format is
removed and reestablished.  That should not ordinarily be a problem, but it
could be a surprise for system administrators who are not aware of this
behavior.
<p>
The patch set received a small number of generally favorable reviews.  If
it is merged, as seems likely, it will make it easier to run containers
built for a number of machine architectures on the same host, making Linux
containers more flexible in general.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm sure James did good work but I worry that somewhere along the line the interpreter would retain access to some resource from outside the contained environment, such as the mmap of the interpreter binary outside the container as James notes, that would allow privilege escalation, which he doesn't think is possible but it would be great if someone who understands this better than either of us could comment on it.<br>

Actually, that's not possible.  The emulator runs inside the container, not outside of it.  What is poked through into the container from the outside is a file descriptor, opened in the host OS, which is then mapped and executed inside the container, so any fault in the emulator faults inside the container, not outside of it.  It also means, except for the fd of the emulator binary, the emulator has no access to any resources outside of the container (that's why, as I explained in the 0/3 patch, the emulator has to be static ... it can't resolve dynamic libraries outside of the container)<br>

I'm sure you are probably right, I'm a sysadmin and not much of a developer, but I just have a unformed suspicion that there is some kernel syscall or resource commonly presented inside containers that would treat the open fd from outside the contained environment as an access token proving the program should be allowed to perform operations outside the container that could be leveraged to exit the container.  I don't know of a mechanism to do this, so you are probably right and it's not possible, my lack of confidence is more my lack of deep knowledge of this area than any real problem.<br>

It depends on your flags - in particular, the "O" flag says to pass a pre-opened FD, and pass the FD number as an argument. There's also "C", which implies "O" and calculates credentials according to the binary rather than the interpreter.<br>
<p>
However, you are correct that no mode of operation seems to pass it on stdin.<br>

Unfortunately this solution still requires the emulator to be statically linked.<br>
Hard-linking or bind-mounting a single emulator binary isn't that difficult, so I don't think this feature helps much.<br>

Well, there's also that because it's executed from a pre-opened FD, these may be relevant:<br>
<p>
- Possibly less overhead, as it doesn't need to do FS traversals to get to the binary<br>
- Doesn't break if the user accidentally unlinks it (as was called out as a potential failure mode of what you suggest)<br>
- Reduces the divergence between an emulated container and a native container on that arch (as far as the emulated container can see)<br>
- Avoids any need to make changes _within_ the container to boot it on another host arch<br>
- Likely more I haven't thought of<br>

The problem with both of those is that they contaminate the container image, which makes it hard to handle non native pure images.  Secondly, with hard linking, the emulator has to be on the same mount as the image, which usually isn't the case for docker style images and for bind mounting, you require the support of the container orchestration system to perform the bind mount.  None of this can't be solved, but it's certainly a lot easier to have the emulation just work.<br>

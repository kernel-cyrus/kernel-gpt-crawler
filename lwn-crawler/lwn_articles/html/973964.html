<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are organized with their CPUs
grouped into nodes, each of which has memory attached to it.  All memory in
the system is accessible from all CPUs, but memory attached to the local
node is faster.  The kernel's <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">memory-policy
("mempolicy") interface</a> allows threads to inform the kernel about how
they would like their memory placed to get the best performance.  In recent
years, the NUMA concept has been extended to support the management of
different types of memory in a system, pushing the limits of the mempolicy
subsystem.  In a remotely presented session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Gregory Price discussed
the ways in which the kernel's memory-policy support should evolve to
handle today's more-complex systems.
<p>
Heterogeneous-memory systems may seem like exotic beasts, Price began, but
they are actually common; even a simple two-socket server, with its two
banks of memory with different access characteristics, is a
heterogeneous-memory system.  On such systems, developers have to think
about where their tasks run, or performance will suffer.  Future systems
will be worse, though; they will be "a monstrosity", equipped with ordinary
DRAM (at various distances), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link">CXL memory</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">high-bandwidth
memory</a>, and more.  The kernel's mempolicy API was not designed for this
kind of system — or even today's basic two-socket system, he said.
<p>
Memory tiering has been a frequent topic of discussion at LSFMM+BPF for
some years now, and memory policy clearly will be a part of the tiering
solution, but tiering and mempolicy are aimed at slightly different
problems.  The tiering discussion is all about memory <i>movement</i>
between different memory tiers, while the mempolicy interface is about
<i>allocation</i>.  The former is focused on migration, while the latter is
about node selection.  In a perfect world, the kernel would always place
memory allocations perfectly, but we do not live in that world.
Allocations will be wrong, or usage patterns will change over time.  Thus,
he said, tiering is useful and necessary — but so is better allocation
policy.
<p>
In current systems, every thread can have its own memory policy; that
policy can even be different for each virtual-memory area in the thread.
There are four policy types available to control where allocations are
placed: default to the local node, allocate on a set of preferred nodes,
interleave across a set of nodes in a round-robin fashion, and weighted
interleaving.
<p>
The last option, <a href="/Articles/948037/">weighted interleaving</a>, was
added for the 6.9 kernel.  It is controlled with a set of global weights
managed via sysfs.  The administrator can use these weights to try to obtain
optimal bandwidth use across all memory interconnects; putting some
frequently used data in slower memory can improve performance overall if it
keeps all of the interconnects fully busy.  Weighted interleaving can thus
improve throughput, but can also complicate the latency story.  This
mechanism is sufficient for simple tasks, and a number of useful lessons
have been learned from its implementation.
<p>
<h4>Lessons learned</h4>
<p>
One of those lessons is simply that the kernel's memory-policy features
have not kept up with the evolution of the computing environment in which
they run.  Consider, he said, a single-socket system running with attached
CXL memory, which is slower than DRAM.  A streaming benchmark will run
78%&nbsp;slower on that system than on a machine with DRAM only.  But, with
a proper, task-wide weighted-interleaving policy, that benchmark will run
somewhere between 6% slower and 4%&nbsp;<i>faster</i>.  That is better,
"but it still sucks".  It is possible to get good results on such systems,
but processes are forced to be NUMA-aware to get those results.
<p>
The current mechanism is built around the idea that either the
administrator or some sort of daemon will manage the weights used for
interleaving.  He has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240220202529.2365-1-gregory.price@memverge.com/">an
RFC patch</a> circulating to do this automatically using information from
the system's heterogeneous memory attribute table (HMAT), but that is not
an easy thing to do, especially in systems where memory hotplugging is in
use, on complex NUMA systems, or on systems with other types of complex
memory topologies.  Task-local weights can help, but that feature was
dropped out of the patch set merged for 6.9, because it needs some new
system calls; he has <a href="/Articles/969379/">another RFC patch set</a>
out there that adds them.
<p>
While the current memory-policy API can be made to work, it is unwieldy at
best on large NUMA systems.  Sub-NUMA clustering (a recent hardware feature
that partitions NUMA zones into smaller sub-zones) is hard to use well with
this API.  In general the number of nodes showing up on systems is growing,
but that makes the system as a whole harder to reason about, he said.
<p>
The memory-policy interface is entirely focused on the currently running
task; there is no way for one thread to change another's policies.  Within
the memory-management subsystem, policy changes require a level of access
to the virtual-memory areas (VMAs) that will be painful to extend.  The
current design is not without its advantages; it allows the implementation
of memory policies to be lockless in the allocation paths.  Widening access
without hurting performance will require some significant refactoring and
movement toward the use of read-copy-update (RCU).  Memory policies also
have complex interactions with control groups, and must not violate any
restrictions imposed by control groups.
<p>
Michal Hocko asked how VMA-level manipulation could be implemented without
creating other problems; Price answered that there is a patch for a new
system call (<tt><a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZV5zGROLefrsEcHJ@r13-u19.micron.com/">process_mbind()</a></tt>)
circulating now.  Hocko answered that the patch "is not wrong", but that it
is complicated and has security implications.
<p>
David Hildenbrand asked whether Price was thinking that a system would run
a process that would be adjusting the VMAs of others, or would applications
opt into some sort of management scheme?  Price answered that allowing the
first case is the important part of this work; other types of mechanisms
can come later if need be.  There is no agreement on the existing work yet,
though, so there will be changes to those patches, including trying to make
more use of existing system calls (like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>)
when it makes sense.
<p>
Liam Howlett asked how memory policies would be affected if the scheduler
moves a task elsewhere in the system.  This is a problem that has been
talked about a lot, Price answered.  One of the reasons for the global
interleaving weights is that they ease the problem of dealing with process
migration.  That is also part of why the other system calls have been
pushed back.
<p>
<h4>Proposals</h4>
<p>
Price concluded with a quick look at what is being proposed for the
memory-policy subsystem.  It would be good to get to the point where a
process running with a reasonable policy would get performance close to
what can be had by explicitly binding memory to nodes.  That involves
finding ways to <i>not</i> interleave memory for data that is not driving the
system's memory-bandwidth use.  The plan is to implement
<tt>process_mbind()</tt> in some form; it will use the pidfd abstraction
and be analogous to <a
href="/Articles/810076/"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>.  This mechanism
could be seen as a sort of crude tiering solution that would be useful to
job-scheduling systems.
<p>
There is also a wish to improve how <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><tt>mbind()</tt></a>
performs memory migration.  Currently, bound memory will only be migrated if a
node is removed from the allowed set.  But if a process is set up for
interleaving, and a new node is added, there will be no migration to
rebalance the allocations.  That would be a nice feature to have, but
implementing it could be expensive, he said.  If it can be done, though, he
would like to see redistribution in the interleaved case — and the
configured weights should be applied when this happens.
<p>
Finally he asked whether memory policies should be integrated with control
groups.  That could be awkward, since memory policies are lockless, while
control groups are not.  Hocko was skeptical, saying that control groups
are all about hierarchies, and he does not see a way to define a reasonable
hierarchical policy.  Price said, though, that control-group integration
would ease the management of sets of policies, and simplify the handling of
migration.  But he acknowledged that this idea has not found any sort of
consensus; he will continue looking for solutions.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Swap differs in that memory contents moved there are no longer accessible from the CPU, so it has to be handled differently.

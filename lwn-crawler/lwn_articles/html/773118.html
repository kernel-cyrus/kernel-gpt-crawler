<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 29, 2018</br>
           </div>
The Spectre class of hardware vulnerabilities was apparently so-named
because it can be expected to haunt us for some time.  One aspect of that
haunting can be seen in the fact that, nearly one year after Spectre was
disclosed, the kernel is still unable to prevent one user-space process
from attacking another in some situations.  An attempt to provide that
protection using a new x86 microcode feature called <tt>STIBP</tt> has run into
trouble once its performance impact was understood; now a more nuanced
approach may succeed in providing protection where it is needed without
slowing down everybody else.
<p>
The Spectre variant 2 vulnerability works by polluting the CPU's
branch-prediction buffer (BPB), which is used during speculative execution to
make a guess about which branch(es) the code will take; see <a
href="/Articles/743265/">this article</a> for a refresher on the Spectre
vulnerabilities if needed.  Closing this hole
requires changes at a number of levels, but a fundamental part of the
problem is preventing any code that may be targeted from running with a
BPB that has been trained by an attacker.
<p>
There are a few ways in which this can be accomplished; in many cases the
appropriate tool is  a new instruction called <tt>IBPB</tt>, which flushes
the BPB. 
Developers have been <a href="/Articles/764209/">discussing</a> the right
times to execute <tt>IBPB</tt> instructions for some time, but the overall
strategy is relatively straightforward: an <tt>IBPB</tt> instruction should be run
whenever the CPU switches between tasks that do not trust each other.  A
few modes for determining when <tt>IBPB</tt> should be used have been
implemented and can be selected with command-line options.
<p>
<tt>IBPB</tt> leaves one part of the problem unsolved, though.  When
simultaneous  multithreading (SMT, or "hyperthreading") is in use, two threads
of execution are, for all practical purposes, executing on the same CPU
simultaneously.  Those threads will share the same BPB; if one thread
populates the BPB with hostile entries, the other thread will be affected
by them until the next <tt>IBPB</tt> instruction is executed.  In other
words, SMT processors create an ongoing series of time windows in which one
thread may attack another, even when <tt>IBPB</tt> is in use.  Some
security-sensitive users have disabled SMT entirely in response to this
problem (and others), but not everybody wants to pay that cost.

<p>
That is where <tt>STIBP</tt> comes in.  It is a processor mode (rather than
an instruction) that, according to <a
href="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf">Intel's
press materials [PDF]</a>, "<q>prevents indirect branch predictions from
being controlled by the sibling Hyperthread</q>".  This sounds like just
what is needed to keep threads from attacking each other.  After some
discussion, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/53c613fe6349994f023245519265999eed75957f"><tt>STIBP</tt>
support</a> was added to the kernel during the 4.20 merge window.  At that
time, the decision was made to enable <tt>STIBP</tt> by default and to
leave it on, so that systems would automatically be protected.  This patch
was subsequently backported to the 4.19.2, 4.18.19, 4.14.81, and 4.9.137
stable updates.
<p>
It turns out, however, that there is a problem with <tt>STIBP</tt>: it
slows the system down significantly for many workloads.  Linus Torvalds
managed to keep his 
promise to be more polite when he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whtiX45YPjFPMFuktZ3WB23zqBZR-rL6RewrTyvrFj2Fw@mail.gmail.com/">described
what is going on</a>, but it must have been a strain:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Yes, Intel calls it "STIBP" and tries to make it out to be about
	the indirect branch predictor being per-SMT thread.
<p>
	But the reason it is unacceptable is apparently because in reality
	it just disables indirect branch prediction entirely. So yes,
	*technically* it's true that that limits indirect branch prediction
	to just a single SMT core, but in reality it is just a "go really
	slow" mode.
</div>
<p>
As reports of performance regressions started rolling in, it became clear
that the decision to enable <tt>STIBP</tt> by default would have to be
revisited.  In the resulting <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wg-9FUGU=grF4gKDq1sm1m39Jbs3A_iyLbSSntU47ncwg@mail.gmail.com/">discussion</a>,
Torvalds said that <tt>STIBP</tt> needed to be made an optional feature that could
be enabled by "<q>crazy people</q>" who are willing to pay the
performance cost it brings.  Arjan van de Ven <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/51127fd4-5dcc-b2b9-4873-72098d2a77d9@linux.intel.com/">said</a>
that both Intel and AMD recommend against enabling it by default (though
Intel has apparently not actually documented that recommendation
anywhere).  Ingo Molnar <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181119083855.GA129733@gmail.com/">promised</a> to
require performance measurements for any future mitigations before they can
be merged.  The <tt>STIBP</tt> patch was reverted in the 4.19.4
4.14.83, and 4.9.140 stable updates; it remains in 4.18 since that series
is no longer receiving updates.
<p>
As of this writing, the <tt>STIBP</tt> patch is also still in the mainline
kernel, pending the finalization of a better solution.  That solution is
likely to take the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181125183328.318175777@linutronix.de/">this patch
set</a> posted by Thomas Gleixner, containing the work of a number of
developers.  <tt>STIBP</tt> is disabled on any system that does not
actually have running processors with SMT enabled, even if such processors
could materialize in the future.  It is also disabled by default for most
processes on the system, but it can be globally enabled with the
<tt>spectre_v2_user=on</tt> command-line option.
<p>
There is also a new set of values for the <tt>spectre_v2=</tt> command-line
option that can be used to enable more control over branch prediction:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>spectre_v2=prctl</tt> leaves both <tt>IBPB</tt> and <tt>STIBP</tt>
     disabled by default, but allows them to be enabled for individual
     processes via a new <tt>prctl()</tt> operation.  In this mode, the
     system can generally run without the extra overhead of the Spectre
     mitigations, but those mitigations can be turned on for specific
     processes that need extra protection.
<li> <tt>spectre_v2=seccomp</tt> is the same as the <tt>prctl</tt> mode,
     with the exception that any processes running under <tt>seccomp()</tt>
     will have the mitigations enabled unconditionally.
<li> <tt>spectre_v2=prctl,ibpb</tt> enables <tt>IBPB</tt> globally in the
     system, but only enables <tt>STIBP</tt> for processes that have turned
     it on with <tt>prctl()</tt>.
<li> <tt>spectre_v2=seccomp,ibpb</tt> enables <tt>IBPB</tt> globally, and
     <tt>STIBP</tt> for all <tt>seccomp()</tt> processes and those that
     have enabled it explicitly.
</ul>
<p>
This set contains 28 individual patches; it is not a trivial thing to merge
this late in the development cycle (or into a stable kernel update).  That
appears to be the plan, though; the patches have been pulled into the tip
tree and are likely to hit the mainline in the near future.  Invasive
changes like 
this are just part of the deal in the post-Spectre world, it seems.  Once
the dust settles, though, Linux systems will have more complete protection
against Spectre variant&nbsp;2, but the cost of that protection will only
need to be paid by those who feel that they need it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why would anyone want to enable this "go really slow" mode (disabling branch prediction) rather than just getting the "go slightly slower" effect of disabling hyperthreading?  What exactly is Intel's envisaged use for it?<br>
<p>
Are there some obscure workloads where hyperthreading gives a big speedup, but branch prediction doesn't really matter, and moreover the hyperthreaded tasks on the same CPU don't trust each other?<br>

Remember, this is all about the *indirect* branch predictor (The I in STIBP is "Indirect").  STIBP does not disable all branch prediction.  Also, the impact can vary drastically based on the microarchitecture.  A processor that has hardware mitigations for Spectre v2 might enumerate support for STIBP and allow it to be enabled, but have negligible additional overhead.<br>
<p>
Also, remember that we have very limited support for comprehending the trust relationship between any software threads running on a CPU core.  We largely don't know if they trust each other or not.<br>
<p>
So, no this isn't about obscure workloads.  It's about mixing normal workloads with sensitive ones that we want to protect.<br>

I assume this is like most ISA additions: new CPUs implement them efficiently, so they're faster than the alternatives, while old CPUs implement them correctly, so programs function. It's just that the new CPUs that can split the BPB by thread and run fast with STIBP don't exist at all yet.<br>

The factdl that this patch made it through the maintainers is probably a late effect of the secrecy that covered all the Spectre/Meltdown work one year ago. It was not documented, but still known, that IBRS and STIBP were, at least for some processors, a bigger hammer than what the documentation suggested.<br>

I do not, as IMHO calling anyone an idiot (or stupid, or similar) is simply unacceptable between decent human beings. Calling a product of their work idiotic or saying they behave stupidly or something in that manner is still bad behavior but somewhat better, it usually can and should be said with as precise but less strong words. People themselves should never be attacked, it's enough to criticize (hopefully constructively) their actual work that you take issue with.<br>

Linus was not in the habit of calling people idiots. Bad ideas and corporations, sure.<br>

He had to stop because, among other reasons, actual idiots were misinterpreting it as celebrity endorsement of their misanthropic, diseased attitudes toward other people.<br>

"  Linus calling anyone an idiot" <br>

I am sorry and think you are hindsight and missing the context of those calling in the past. There is no point spreading the FUD, please don't.<br>
<p>
No, I am not in favor of abusing people in any form or anybody doing it publicly, but there was some context before that calling, please do care to read those, which led to that outburst. <br>

Absolutely. The parent comment insinuated that Linus was in fact calling everybody an idiot, all the time. This is, of course, false.<br>
<p>
The question really is, is it permisible to call someone "idiot" when you think it is deserved? If it is not, then what we are effectively doing is censoring the word "idiot". Censoring words is an idiotic (sorry, I mean much less than adequate), way to proceed, because people will find ways to "politely" be as much offensive.<br>
<p>
Better than censoring, we should promote communication styles that add to the *content* of the conversation.<br>

<p>
I don't think people actually deserve being called “idiots” if they write ill-advised code. I've done that for sure, you've probably done it on occasion, even Linus Torvalds has probably done it once or twice. If it happens, by all means call our <em>code</em> bad, or even idiotic if you must. But don't call <em>us</em> idiots. Certainly not over the Internet. If you want to call me an idiot, do it to my face or don't do it at all.

I am probably worring over nothing, but when you have one SMT running in kernel mode (ring 0), and a sibling SMT running userspace code (ring 3), wouldn't STIBP be required to avoid the side-channel, since the BPB is shared?<br>
<p>
Or is the BPB engineered in such a way that one ring cannot pollute/train/alias BPB entries for a different ring?<br>

Yep. Or, if one does not use retpoline, and uses IBRS instead (e.g., on future hardware where that may be faster, or as Xen does already, in some cases), that --I mean setting IBRS when entering ring 0-- prevents BTB updates done in ring 3 to affect branches in context with more privilege (like ring 0). Or so I've understood. :-D<br>

That's how I understood it as well, but...<br>
<p>
While it is likely to be true for "enhanced IBRS" (the one you leave always on, and which doesn't exist quite yet), for the current crop of processors that are way too prone to leak fleeting images of a future past, IMHO it is a IBRS property better tested before being trusted to exist.<br>

After all, it is all about ghosts, and ghosts are tricky ;-)<br>

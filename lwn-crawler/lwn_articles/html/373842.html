<p>
The perf tool for performance analysis is adding functionality quickly.
Since being <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/339361/">added to the
mainline</a> in 2.6.31, primarily as a means to access various CPU
performance counters, it has expanded its scope.  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/346470/">Support</a> for treating
kernel tracepoint events like performance counter events came into the
kernel at around the same time.  More recently, though, Tom Zanussi has added
support for using perl and python scripts with the perf tool, making it
even easier to do sophisticated processing of perf events.
</p>

<p>
The perl support is already in the mainline, but Zanussi added a
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/371448/">python scripting engine</a> more
recently.  Interpreters for both perl and python can be embedded into the
perf executable, which allows processing the raw perf trace data stream in
either of those languages.
</p>

<p>
The perl scripting can be used from the 2.6.33-rc series, but the python
support is only available by applying Zanussi's patches to the <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/mingo/tip.git/README">tip tree</a>.
Building perf in the <tt>tools/perf</tt> directory, which requires
development versions of various libraries and tools (glibc, elfutils, libdwarf,
perl, python, etc.), then gives access to the new functionality.
</p>

<p>
Multiple different example scripts are provided with perf, which can be
listed from perf itself:
<pre>
    # perf trace -l
    List of available trace scripts:
      syscall-counts [comm]                system-wide syscall counts
      syscall-counts-by-pid [comm]         system-wide syscall counts, by pid
      failed-syscalls-by-pid [comm]        system-wide failed syscalls, by pid
      workqueue-stats                      workqueue stats (ins/exe/create/destroy)
      check-perf-trace                     useless but exhaustive test script
      failed-syscalls [comm]               system-wide failed syscalls
      wakeup-latency                       system-wide min/max/avg wakeup latency
      rw-by-file &lt;comm&gt;                    r/w activity for a program, by file
      rw-by-pid                            system-wide r/w activity
</pre>
This list is a mix of perl and python scripts that live in the
<tt>tools/perf/scripts/{perl,python}</tt> directories and get installed in
the proper location (<tt>/root/libexec</tt> by default) after a <tt>make
install</tt>. 


</p>

<p>
The scripts themselves are largely generated by the <tt>perf trace</tt>
command.  Zanussi's documentation for <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/373882/">perf-trace-perl</a> and <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/373881/">perf-trace-python</a> explain the
process of using <tt>perf trace</tt> to create the skeleton scripts, which
can then be edited to add the required functionality.  Adding two helper
shell scripts (for recording and reporting) to the appropriate directory
will add new scripts to the list produced by <tt>perf trace</tt> described
above.  
</p>

<p>
The installed scripts can then be used as follows:
<pre>
    # perf trace record failed-syscalls
    ^C[ perf record: Woken up 11 times to write data ]                         
    [ perf record: Captured and wrote 1.939 MB perf.data (~84709 samples) ]   
</pre>
This captures the perf data into the appropriately named <tt>perf.data</tt>
file, which can then be processed by:
<pre>
    # perf trace report failed-syscalls
    perf trace started with Perl script \
	/root/libexec/perf-core/scripts/perl/failed-syscalls.pl


    failed syscalls, by comm:

    comm                    # errors
    --------------------  ----------
    firefox                     1721
    claws-mail                   149
    konsole                       99
    X                             77
    emacs                         56
    [...]

    failed syscalls, by syscall:

    syscall                           # errors
    ------------------------------  ----------
    sys_read                              2042
    sys_futex                              130
    sys_mmap_pgoff                          71
    sys_access                              33
    sys_stat64                               5
    sys_inotify_add_watch                    4
    [...]

    # perf trace report failed-syscalls-by-pid
    perf trace started with Python script \
	/root/libexec/perf-core/scripts/python/failed-syscalls-by-pid


    syscall errors:

    comm [pid]                           count
    ------------------------------  ----------

    firefox [10144]
      syscall: sys_read
	err = -11                         1589
      syscall: sys_inotify_add_watch
	err = -2                             4

    firefox [10147]
      syscall: sys_futex       
	err = -110                           7
    [...]
</pre>

This simple example shows using the <tt>failed-syscalls</tt> script to
gather the data, then processing it with the corresponding perl script as
well as a compatible python script (<tt>failed-syscall-by-pid</tt>) that slices the same data somewhat
differently.  The first report shows a count of each system call that
failed during the few seconds while the trace was active. It shows the
number of errors by process, as well as by system call.
<p>
The second report combines the two and shows each process along with a
which system calls failed for it, and how many times.  There are also
corresponding scripts that count all system calls, not just those that
failed, and report 
on them similarly. Wakeup latency, file read/write activity, and workqueue
statistics are the focus of some of the other provided scripts.
</p>

<p>
These scripting features will make it that much easier for kernel
hackers&mdash;or possibly those who aren't&mdash;to access the perf
functionality.  The state of tracing and instrumentation in the kernel has
been quick to develop over the last few development cycles.  It doesn't
look to be slowing down anytime soon.

While the scripting support for perf-events is a very useful feature...was wondering if anybody has seen what it takes to have 'live' reporting of data (through perf and hence the script) as opposed to the two-step process - for perf data collection followed by analysis using script?<br>

      You would need pre-filtering/aggregating for that, not post-process scripting. You can do something like that with for example systemtap which filters and can aggregate values at probe point hit time, so the only data being recorded is that which is needed for the live reporting. e.g. live (top like) reporting failed syscalls with argument strings would be done by <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/examples/process/errsnoop.stp">errsnoop.stp</a>

<pre>
$ stap errsnoop.stp
          SYSCALL         PROCESS   PID HITS ERRSTR       ARGSTR
inotify_add_watch gdm-simple-gree  2569    2  13 (EACCES) 18, "/home/mark", 16789454
             open hald-addon-stor  2178    1 123 (ENOMEDIUM) "/dev/sdh", O_RDONLY
             open hald-addon-stor  2175    1 123 (ENOMEDIUM) "/dev/sde", O_RDONLY
             open hald-addon-stor  2177    1 123 (ENOMEDIUM) "/dev/sdg", O_RDONLY
             open hald-addon-stor  2174    1 123 (ENOMEDIUM) "/dev/sdd", O_RDONLY
             open hald-addon-stor  2176    1 123 (ENOMEDIUM) "/dev/sdf", O_RDONLY
             open        sendmail  2291    1   6 (ENXIO)  "/proc/loadavg", O_RDONLY
</pre>
And you can then let it simple run to see live what silly things user space programs are doing. Some other systemtap process <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/examples/keyword-index.html#PROCESS">examples</a>.

'Live' reporting should be just a short step away - to do that we could stick a pipe in between the 'record' and 'report' steps e.g.<br>
<p>
$ perf trace record myscript | perf trace report myscript<br>
<p>
or more simply just get rid of the two steps and combine them into one: <br>
<p>
$ perf trace myscript<br>
<p>
Currently, perf isn't pipe-friendly mainly because of the header-read/write code, which pre-allocates space in the file and does a lot of seeking to fill in length and offset fields later.  That works nicely for a file, but presents problems if you want to feed it into a pipe.<br>
<p>
I think if some changes were made to that part of the code, the rest would follow naturally.  I plan to look into it soon and hopefully post some patches to enable it.<br>

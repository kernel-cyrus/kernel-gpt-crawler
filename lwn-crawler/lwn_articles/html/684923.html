Memory-management subsystem testing is notoriously difficult; mistakes in
the code often make themselves felt far from the place where things
actually went wrong.  Things are being done to improve testing in the
kernel, though; Sasha Levin led a session at the 2016 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit to discuss what has been done and
how memory-management testing can be improved.
<p>
Sasha started by saying that he has been working with the <a
href="/Articles/612153/">KASan</a> memory-error detection tool in an
attempt to find places where the 
necessary locks are not being taken.  But, to get there, he needs to be
able to annotate which memory is protected by each lock, and he is not sure
how to proceed.  Adding that information inline, or in
<tt>spin_lock_init()</tt>, doesn't seem like the best solution.  Christoph
Lameter suggested that the locking requirements could be put into the
relevant structure definitions, but that could get messy; there were
concerns about what that would do to the already convoluted <a
href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>struct page</tt></a>, for example.
<p>
The discussion moved on to <tt>VM_BUG_ON()</tt> calls, which cause an oops
when an assertion finds something wrong.  A lot of these, he said, could be
relocated to, for example, where page flags are written.  That would catch
problems at the source, rather than tripping over them at some later
point.  The problem with that approach might be the performance cost, since
it would be adding checks at every write to the page flags.  Kirill
Shutemov also worried about potential false positives; if flags are changed

in multiple steps, they could appear to be in an incorrect state between
those steps.  Hugh Dickins agreed that there would be a lot of noise
resulting from 
such a change, and said that nobody would bother to try to fix it all.
<p>
One possible improvement might be to validate the page flags only when a
page is unlocked.  Sasha said he would put a proposal together and see what
sort of response he gets.

<p>
He is also trying to improve testing of the handling of huge pages.  To
that end, he has written a patch to expose the list of huge pages to
debugfs; that allows him to force page splits at inconvenient times to see
what happens.  He plans to clean that patch up and submit it soon.
<p>
The final topic of discussion was kernel trees for testing.  Sasha said
that Andrew Morton's "mmotm" tree contains changes that are thought to be
suitable for the next merge window, but that is only so helpful to get
testing for large memory-management patch sets, which often go through
several iterations before reaching that point.  So he is thinking about
running a testing tree of his own containing patches from "known authors,"
in the hope of catching problems earlier.  Would that be useful, he asked,
and would others make use of it?
<p>
Andrew responded that it's often more useful if one person provides the
testing service, rather than putting out a tree in the hope that others
will test it.  But he might consider pulling it into mmotm.  Hugh
worried, though, that doing so might destabilize the mmotm tree.  Sasha
responded that such destabilization was exactly the purpose — it would help
to bring out problems early.  But whether such destabilization would be
welcome for mmotm users in general is not clear.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<h1>More quotes of the week - scenes from a flame war</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
As it turns out, there is very little from the recent, 1000-message GPLv3
flame war that justified the expenditure of so many bits.  For those who
haven't gotten around to reading the whole thing, here's a few selections.

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think that the Open Source community (and the FSF too) is much
	better off *not* concentrating so much on "legal rules" of what can
	and cannot be done, and instead spend much more effort on showing
	people why the whole "Open Source" thing actually works.
	And in fact, I think that's _exactly_ what Linux has been doing for the 
	last decade!
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238971/">Linus Torvalds</a>


<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But if by the question you mean "would you think the GPLv3 is fine
	without the new language in section 6 about the 'consumer
	devices'", then the answer is that yes, I think that the current
	GPLv3 draft looks fine apart from that.
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238973/">Linus Torvalds</a>

<p>

<div class="BigQuote">
	I don't see how you can claim that the vendor is infringing on your
	freedom, _you_ made the decision to go out and buy the product
	knowing that the vendor wasn't going to go out of their way to help
	you hack the device. In many cases the vendor doesn't even have the
	option (802.11b channels and certification come to mind, GSM, etc.)
	of opening things up to the end user, and making changes to the
	license isn't going to magically change any of this.
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238970/">Paul Mundt</a>


<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I see a lot more prohibitions than freedoms in what TiVo does.  I
	don't understand why you'd stand up for it.  Is it more important
	that a single company be allowed to impose prohibitions on others
	in order for its business model to work, than to maintain the
	spirit of hacking and sharing that enabled Free Software and Linux
	to flourish?  Do you expect Linux would have flourished if
	computers had locks that stopped people from modifying Linux in
	them?
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238978/">Alexandre Oliva</a>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So instead of thinking of Tivo as something "evil", I think of Tivo
	as the working bee who will never pass on its genes, but it
	actually ended up helping the people who *do* pass on their genes:
	the kernel (to a small degree - not so much because of the patches
	themselves, as the *mindshare* in the PVR space) and projects like
	MythTV (again, not so much because of any patches, but because it
	helped grow peoples understanding of the problem space!).
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238975/">Linus Torvalds</a>


<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I believe RMS should accept the fact that most of that code was
	written without people having bought into his ideology, and he
	should accept _responsibility_ for the power he has acquired by
	genius or by accident (your choice) and he should try to
	_understand_ how those people tick - instead of trying to further
	his own personal agenda.
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238974/">Ingo Molnar</a>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I beg to differ. By adopting _his_ license you adopted his view. If
	you don't like that then choose a different license (which
	obviously you are free to do).
</div>
-- <a href="/Articles/238976/">Michael Gerdau</a>
<p>

<div class="BigQuote">
	The GPLv2 does not state that you have to become a slave of rms and
	follow him in all things, and agree with him. Really. You must have
	read some other (perhaps unreleased early draft?) version.

      Where's the manual? UTSL, Use The Source, Luke. <br>
 <br>
This is what open source got started. UTSL is what brought open source <br>
in a global display. Suddenly there's a problem. Corporate IT consumers <br>
like to have the easy digestable takeaways. You want fries togo with  <br>
that, Sir? Apparently Open source based IT businesses suddenly have a new <br>
market and opportunities.  <br>
 <br>
The problem is with the linux kernel itself. I personally don't see  <br>
it as a problem. Please leave the linux-kernel core developers alone. If <br>
there's a corporate demand for speedy developments inside the <br>
kernel, start hiring qualified people who can deliver. <br>
 <br>
The real issues are of course in the details. Corporate IT consumers <br>
should start reading the GPLv3 and submit their own suggestions to the <br>
FSF.  <br>

      I don't know if I'd want this to be LWN's purpose, but it's certainly a wonderful sketch of what must have been a heck of a conflagration.  Who'd have thought a bike shed would burn so brightly?

<p>
site:lkml.org "firstname lastname"<br>
site:lkml.org "firstname lastname" gplv3<br>

taking the ratio of the latter to the former.<br>

      Wow, I'm truly amazed that only 20% of my postings to LKML are not in any way related with GPLv3.  I've historically been a quiet bystander.  Maybe if you extend the search to cover other licensing-related topics you'll get something closer to 100%.  The few exceptions would be my occasional patches to firewire, raid and the FR-V port, when problems in them hit me hard enough for me to decide to do something about them.  Fortunately I could not only modify the sources, but also use the resulting binary in the computers at my disposal.  Yay! :-)<br>

      What constraints are these?  I'm not aware of any FR-V constraints I've added myself that haven't been contributed.  Maybe someone else added them and forgot to submit them upstream such that I could approve them?  Is that somehow my fault?<br>

      That would be "U".  Compare the date when its use appeared in<br>
the mainline kernel and the date when support went into released<br>
gcc.  I doubt that it had been your fault; just that mentioning<br>
frv in that context was... unfortunate.  Seriously, frv situation<br>
had been extremely annoying for about a year, e.g. for cross-builds.<br>

      How true. I can understand how Linus sees TiVo as "not evil", even if he has to disguise it with strange "working bee" analogies. Kernel developers want to extend kernel usage as much as possible, since it gives them good jobs and fame. Kernel users (that is, essentially all of us -- including kernel developers) want to keep our freedoms, granted to us by the choice of license.
<p>
In this particular context it seems that Linux is only used in TiVo because it can be locked down, and therefore users are set to lose regardless; the alternatives would be some other proprietary systems. So Linus says "better locked Linux than nothing", i.e. "I don't care about how Linux is used". Meanwhile the FSF says "let's not make it easy for locked down devices", which translates roughly to "give me liberty or give me death". Both positions have merit IMHO, so both sides should be heard.

      it's a lot more then just 'linux anywhere, at any cost' and saing that it's to get them jobs is beyond reason<br>
<p>
as they stated very clearly in the discussion. they released code under the requirement that people who modified the code and distributed it make their changes available. Tivo has complied with this requirement<br>
<p>
Tivo could have selected a different OS and locked it down (including any of the *BSDs) so saying that they selected linux becouse it could be locked down doesn't explain anything.<br>
<p>
especially becouse they didn't lock down their first products, the lockdowns started happening later.<br>

Why, exactly? It is natural to push your product as a developer, and even more as a free software developer. It has the lucky consequence of helping developers get fame and good jobs, and it is perfectly respectable.
<blockquote type="cite">
they released code under the requirement that people who modified the code and distributed it make their changes available.
</blockquote>
The code is released under a lot of requirements, they are collectively called "GPL license" and they are preceded by a little preamble that says, among other things: "By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users". The goal of the license is to allow users the same freedoms as developers, and these include the ability to run modified copies of the software.
<p>
TiVo is clearly not complying with the spirit of the license, even if many developers are OK with this particular use of their code. I gather from the LWN quotes that this particular point is not under discussion.
<blockquote type="cite">
especially becouse they didn't lock down their first products, the lockdowns started happening later.
</blockquote>
Then it should read "Linux is <i>still</i> used in TiVo only because it can be locked down". Linux wasn't selected because it could be locked down, but if it could not, TiVo would have probably selected some other OS (and probably proprietary). I think that the meaning is clear enough.

Well, thanks for the "True Believer" part, I guess... for the record, I've been known to use "Linux" without the leading "GNU/" in informal conversation, I don't possess (to the best of my knowledge) a gold-plated set of GNU CDs, and I think I might have even tolerated the use of "open source" in society without having to compulsively explain the difference with "Free software". (Luckily in my native language "software libre" is not ambiguous with "software gratis", and "fuente abierta" is just meaningless, so my fellow Spaniards are spared from endless rants.) It must be that the requirements for True Believers(tm) are a bit lower these days.

Then somebody should tell Linus, because it seems that if that pesky "consumer devices" clause is changed  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/238973/" >he will approve the GPLv3</a>.

I'm glad you enjoy it, I personally find the resulting kernel very useful and therefore respect your job a lot. I still think that going around calling people "of my ilk" names is not too constructive.

Can we discuss this bit, or is it just pure dogma? Because if it is then I think "True Believer (tm)" just got a new friend ;)

      Eh...  I hope you do realize that Linus' opinion on v3 does not<br>
determine that of other people, all FSF apologists' wanking<br>
nonwithstanding.  Moreover, not everyone who considers tivoization<br>
a bad thing approves of section 6, obviously not for same reasons<br>
as Linus...  And no, I'm not going to summarize the thread for you;<br>
RTFArchives if you care.<br>
<p>
As for objective reality...  Are you serious?  How about the fact<br>
that physics manages to make correct predictions that have to be<br>
either true or false regardless of observer's culture, for starters?<br>
Or that mathematics is not subjective, to pick more fundamental<br>
layer - degree of internal consistency is too high to seriously<br>
discuss that...  If you really want to indulge in postmodernist<br>
verbal masturbation, it's your business; I have more interesting<br>
and satisfying things to do with my mind, thank you very much.<br>
And no, lwn is not a place for remedial course on phylosophy of<br>
science, so you'll have to go elsewhere for that either.<br>

      Linus is known to be a good shepherd of cats, so once he is convinced the rest of the kernel world will probably follow suit. Thanks for not summarizing the details of the debate, not interested.
<p>
About the rest: what a wonderful display of condescension! Let me repay you in kind. Yes, I am dead serious; reality is not too consistent, even in Physics. Your typical Physics 101 course shows you a bunch of answers, but it doesn't even teach you the language to start making questions of your own. Once you delve deeper you are taught the real value of those answers (which is little) and how to question them, which is the truly scientific way of proceeding.
<p>
You are right that this is not the place to show you the cracks in reality; and anyhow, why should anyone want to make you question reality, if you feel comfortable with it? Let others face the voids of infinity and feel their stomachs turn and the ground under their feet open, so you can go back to your kernel code listings and feel all smug about it.
<p>
But all those onanistic references have earned you at least a little peek. The stumbling blocks in our knowledge of the physical world are the same that Heraclitus of Ephesus faced 2500 years ago: identity and infinity, which are subsets of the general problem of being. How can the the river keep being equal to itself, and yet it is ever changing? How can the arrow travel a distance which can be infinitely subdivided? In modern physics infinity rears its stomach-turning face in long series of infinities which should cancel each other but don't, or in a Universe which should be finite but doesn't seem to be. Meanwhile identity shows up in a zoo of subatomical particles which are constantly changing state and whose duration is often a matter of femtoseconds, but all equal to each other.
<p>
It is easy to predict that 2500 years from now Physics will be much changed, but mankind will still not have the answer to the fundamental questions: is the Universe finite or infinite? What are things made of? And the best of all: why is there anything instead of nothing? The words of Hippocrates of Kos will probably be as valid as they were 24 centuries ago:
<blockquote>
But men do not have the science to examine those things which are veiled based on those which are apparent: using arts similar to the human way of being they do not recognize it: which is that the minds of the gods taught them to imitate their godly works, knowing what they do but not knowing that which they imitate.
</blockquote>
Which means that the deeper we delve into the natural world the less we understand it, and the less valid our human concepts become. Yes, Physics works, some of the time, but it means little outside of Physics; it is a feeble justification for reality.

unsurprising...  Nobody says that Physics 101 gives one all<br>
answers, correct answers or happens to be taught well.  BTW,<br>

give you an understanding of difference between Zeno's stuff<br>
and QED one and lack of relationship between those beyond the use<br>
of the same word.  And no, popular retellings do not count.<br>

And learn real mathematics, please - again, not limited to freshman<br>

popular retellings miss that completely.<br>

      I'm sure Al Viro is quite familiar with the philisophical void.  Causality is an illusion!  Descartes couldn't exit his empty room, Godel showed that there's no such thing as trust, 9.8 m/s/s is an unprovable convenience.  Let's all throw up our hands in despair!<br>

I realize that you were satirizing Viro's post mocking your own, but I'm not quite sure what you were trying to say...   Maybe lay off the philosophy books for a bit until reality returns?  :)<br>

Bad editing on my part!  Godel ostensibly showe that there is no  such thing as *reason*.  (which is sort of true, but philosophers carry it to absurd conclusions).  Sorry bout that.  :)<br>

Yeah, it was <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/">Thompson</A> who showed there's no such thing as trust.

I guess Albert Einstein said it better:

As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

      Actually, that is a lousy translation. It can be better expressed as:
<blockquote>
As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not true; and as far as they are true, they are not real.

      <p><i>How can the arrow travel a distance which can be infinitely 
subdivided?</i></p>

<p>The funny thing here is that current physics says basically that you 
can't infinitely subdivide neither the distance, nor the time - it's all 
quantized. If you could subdivide both distance and time infinitely, it 
works out ok again, as well (just that this type of mathematics was 
developed 2000 years later). But if you feel uncomfortable with infinity, 
take the current view of the universe, which is finite and quantized in 
time and space.</p>

<p><i>Why is there anything instead of nothing?</i></p>

<p>Now this is a real hard problem, but even in math you have to accept 
some assumptions before you can even ask a single question.</p>

I'm not sure what you mean by this -- certainly, time and space could be subdivided infinitely when I studied QED. At the same time, too; the equations used to work just fine. It just doesn't make too much sense under a threshold.
<p>
If I remember correctly, one way to derive the equations of quantum mechanics was to suppose that particles could only be in the vertices of a lattice, and then make the separation between lattice nodes go to zero.
<p>
By the way, "quantized" doesn't mean that a magnitude cannot be infinitely subdivided; it means that it can only take certain values. Those values need not be equally spaced, and they can be determined to arbitrary precision too, like the energies for a particle. Particles will usually be in a superposition of states so their energy cannot be ascertained. The same happens for time and space; but those two magnitudes are not quantized and so the particle has a wave function which spreads over space.
<p>
Perhaps I misunderstood you? Are you talking about a different theory?

Maybe I gave the impression that I have a phobia to infinity or something. I don't, I'm probably like every other guy, I'm fascinated and scared by it. I was just suggesting that, now as 2500 years ago, infinities start at the point where we stop understanding things; a subtlety which was not very well expressed, it seems.
<blockquote type="cite">

The Universe is only finite because we would like it to be. Cosmologists are still searching for "dark matter", a substance about which we have no proof, just so that the equations yield a finite Universe. This "dark matter" is more faith than substance, if you ask me.

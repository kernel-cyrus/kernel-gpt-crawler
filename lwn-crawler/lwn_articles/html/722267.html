The archaeological evidence is murky, but it would appear that the kernel's
<tt>set_fs()</tt> function was added in November 1991 by a certain Ted
Ts'o; it was in the 0.10 release.  It is, thus, one of the oldest APIs
found within the kernel itself.  Careless use of <tt>set_fs()</tt> has
always been an easy way to create security bugs; a recent attempt to make
these bugs harder to exploit may instead result in this function being removed
altogether.
<p>
The original role of <tt>set_fs()</tt> was to set the x86 processor's FS
segment register which, in the early days, was used to control the range of
virtual addresses that could be accessed by unprivileged code.  The kernel
has, of course, long since stopped using x86 segments this way.  In current
kernels, <tt>set_fs()</tt> works by setting a global variable called
<tt>addr_limit</tt>, but the intended functionality is the same:
unprivileged code is only allowed to dereference addresses that are below
<tt>addr_limit</tt>.  The kernel's <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h#L77"><tt>access_ok()</tt></a>
function, used to 
validate user-space accesses throughout the kernel, is a simple check
against <tt>addr_limit</tt>, with the rest of the protection being handled by
the processor's memory-management unit.
<p>
The <tt>addr_limit</tt> variable, thus, marks the partition between user
and kernel space.  One might think that such a limit would be fixed, with
good reasons for changing it being few and far between.  As it happens,
there are 
nearly 400 <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls in the kernel.  Usually, such calls are
made to allow code that is normally restricted to accessing user-space
memory to operate on a range of kernel memory instead.  In 0.10, for
example, it was added so that the <tt>exec()</tt> system call could use the
normal filesystem I/O routines to read an executable image into memory that
was not yet part of the calling program's address space.
<p>
The usual pattern for use of <tt>set_fs()</tt> looks like <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/fs/splice.c#L356">this
code snippet</a> from the <tt>splice()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    old_fs = get_fs();
    set_fs(get_ds());
    res = vfs_readv(file, (const struct iovec __user *)vec, vlen, &amp;pos, 0);
    set_fs(old_fs);
</pre>
<p>
This sequence temporarily raises <tt>addr_limit</tt> so that
<tt>vfs_readv()</tt>, which is normally restricted to reading data into
user-space memory, can read data into a kernel-space pipe buffer.
<p>
In 2010, it was <a href="/Articles/419141/">discovered</a> that, if the
kernel could be made to oops between the two <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls, the
second call restoring the address limit would never be made; that left
kernel data open to being 
overwritten by user space.  Hilarity, as they say, ensued in the form of
CVE-2010-4258.  That problem is long since fixed.  In late 2016, though, <a
href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=990">an
Android bug</a> was reported for an LG touchscreen driver; there was a way
to cause that driver to raise <tt>addr_limit</tt> and return to user space,
once again leaving the kernel open to exploitation.
<p>
<tt>set_fs()</tt> is clearly the sort of interface that can easily create
severe security bugs.  It is also a tempting shortcut that tends to find
its way into code of questionable quality such as out-of-tree drivers. 
In an attempt to harden the system against <tt>set_fs()</tt> bugs, Thomas
Garnier posted <a href="/Articles/721305/">a simple patch</a> changing the
system-call code so that it would check <tt>addr_limit</tt> before
returning to user 
space.  If it ever finds an incorrect value, it causes a system panic â€” a
severe response, but probably better than allowing an exploit to occur.
<p>
Nobody disagreed with the goal of this patch, but it ran into a problem that
is familiar to security developers: its impact on performance.  As Ingo
Molnar <a href="/Articles/722268/">pointed out</a>, the patch adds several
instructions to the system-call path, which is one of the most
performance-sensitive parts of the kernel.  Adding overhead to system calls
will slow down everything the kernel does; when one considers how many
Linux machines would be executing this code on every system call, one
begins to think that its carbon footprint might rival that of a small
country.  That is not a cost to be paid lightly.
<p>
Molnar suggested adding some sort of static analysis to the kernel build
system instead.  The standard pattern of <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls should be
amenable to some sort of static analysis, he said, but Kees Cook <a
href="/Articles/722269/">argued</a> that the problem was not quite so
simple and that the cost of the patch was worth paying.  "<q>Until we
can eliminate set_fs(), we need to add this 
check</q>", he said.
<p>
As it happens, some other developers were already considering removing
<tt>set_fs()</tt>, which has, arguably, hung around for far longer than it
really should have.  Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/Articles/722270/">suggested</a> removing all calls outside of the
core filesystem and architecture code; Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/Articles/722271/">went one step further</a> and said they should all go.
Without <tt>set_fs()</tt>, the kernel would be more secure, and the code
that checks user-space memory accesses could become that much simpler.
<p>
Removing <tt>set_fs()</tt> depends on replacing those calls with a better
alternative, of course.  Many <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls exist to enable
I/O to kernel-space memory; it should be possible to replace the bulk of
those using the <a href="/Articles/625077/"><tt>iov_iter</tt>
interface</a>.  Hellwig has <a href="/Articles/722272/">already started</a>
doing this replacement.
<p>
Another common pattern occurs in compatibility code where,
for example, a structure passed to an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call from a 32-bit
user-space process is converted to the 64-bit equivalent in kernel space,
then passed to the regular <tt>ioctl()</tt> implementation.  See <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c#L966"><tt>do_compat_ioctl()</tt></a>
in the media subsystem for an example.  In such cases,
it's just a matter of splitting that implementation into two pieces: one
that fetches the argument from user space, and one that actually performs
the desired action.
<p>
Other <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls will have to be dealt with in other ways.
But it would appear that this ball is now rolling with a certain amount of
momentum.  Given the benefits of removing <tt>set_fs()</tt>, it would not
be surprising to see much of this work merged for 4.13, with the task
completed not long thereafter.  It will be the end of a longstanding
traditional kernel-code pattern, but it's doubtful that many developers
will mourn its passing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
While I get the point that's being made, I doubt the carbon footprint of it would be anywhere close to that of a small country. It's not that I ran the numbers, I'm simply thinking about all the energy inefficient things a lot of people in this day and age do. Next time you open a disposable plastic container such as a pack of gummy bears, think about how far that thing has travelled, and how it's all just going to either end up in a landfill, get incinerated or get washed into the ocean. Doing the ballpark mathematics on this seems difficult due to CPU features such as instruction-level parallelism and various power saving mechanisms.<br>

Let's try to run the numbers.<br>
<p>
Assuming:<br>
 - 2e9 computers, phones, etc. on the world run Linux<br>
 - They are active 10% of the time<br>
 - On average they run 3e9 instructions / second<br>
 - When active, there are 1e4 syscalls / second<br>
 - When active, 30 W of power is used<br>
<p>
Then:<br>
 - 5 instructions of overhead for each syscall results in a 5 * 1e4 / 3e9 * 30 = 0.5 mW extra power when a computer is active.<br>
 - Globally, this means an increased power usage of 0.5mW * 10% * 2e9 = 100 kW<br>
 - On a yearly basis, this amounts to 876000 kWh, which equals to about 700 tons of carbon emissions.<br>
<p>
According to [1], the smallest countries, like Tuvalu, emit 3000 tons per year. So, although not quite there, it is reasonably close.<br>

That's pretty interesting.  The only figure I would take issue with is the 30W power consumption.  Assuming most of those 2e9 devices are phones, the power consumption is probably much, much less than 30W.  It's probably on the order of 1W or less.<br>
<p>
All the information I could find in a quick search is a bit outdated, but here it is anyways:<br>
<p>
This paper has some analysis of mobile phone power consumption:<br>

This article (behind an obtrusive advertisement FYI) says it takes ~1kWh per year to run a mobile phone:<br>

I based the number of 2 billion Linux installations on an article [1] dated 2008 reporting that there the number of personal computers passed the 1 billion mark.<br>
<p>
So the number of desktops, laptops and servers (i.e. computers with a 30W or greater power usage) combined will probably be more than 2 billion right now. Of course not all of them run Linux.<br>
<p>
There have been sold 1.6 billion android phones to date [2]. Excluding discarded phones and including routers and other embedded devices brings the total of active low-power Linux devices probably also in the range of 1-2 billion.<br>
<p>
Anyway, this whole exercise was more to see whether the power savings could even close to the power consumption of a small country. Even if a lot of guesses are wrong, I don't think I'm more than a factor 1000x off.<br>

As an addition to my previous comment:<br>
<p>
Assuming the 30W power consumption was correct, are you sure you have the math right?  I get the following:<br>
<p>
Note .05mW rather than .5mW:<br>
5 * 1e4 / 3e9 * 30 = 0.00005 = 0.05 mW<br>
0.05mW * 10% * 2e9 = 10 kW<br>
10kW * 24 * 365 = 87600 kWh<br>
<p>
After going through this exercise, I also found that I was surprised if even an average desktop CPU would consume .05mW to execute 5000 instructions.  So I looked on Wikipedia [1] to find a Core-i7 940XM, which uses 55W at 2.13GHz.  5000 instructions in that case would take ~.129mW, which means indeed it can take more power than I thought to execute those 5000 instructions.  But even if all those 2e9 devices were running that hungry Core-i7, they would still be consuming roughly 4x less power than the original figures.<br>
<p>
Thanks for provoking an interesting discussion anyways.  Also please correct me if I have gotten anything wrong above.<br>

Please note that I estimated 10.000 syscalls per second.<br>
I did this by firing up a browser under strace and looking up a website. That was 45.000 syscalls in 5.5 seconds.<br>
<p>
Of course this is a really high estimate, because even when a user is actively using his computer, the average number of syscalls/second will be much lower.<br>
<p>
Another big simplification is 1 instruction == 1 cycle. That can certainly be more or less, depending on the specific instructions and other context. But again, this whole exercise was meant as a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 24, 2021</br>
           </div>
The multi-generational LRU patch set is a significant reworking of the
kernel's memory-management subsystem that promises better performance for a
number of workloads; it was <a href="/Articles/851184/">covered here</a> in
April.  Since then, two new versions of that work have been released by
developer Yu Zhao, with
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210520065355.2736558-1-yuzhao@google.com/">version&nbsp;3</a>
being posted on May&nbsp;20.  Some significant changes have been made since
the original post, so another look is in order.
<p>
As a quick refresher: current kernels maintain two least-recently-used
(LRU) lists to track pages of 
memory, called the "active" and "inactive" lists.  The former contains pages
thought to be in active use, while the latter holds pages that are thought
to be unused and available to be reclaimed for other uses; a fair amount of
effort goes into deciding when to move pages between the two lists.  The
multi-generational LRU generalizes that concept into multiple generations,
allowing pages to be in a state between "likely to be active" and "likely
to be unused".
Pages move from older to newer generations when they are
accessed; when memory is needed pages are reclaimed from the oldest
generation.    Generations age over time, with new generations being
created as the oldest ones are fully reclaimed.
<p>
That summary oversimplifies a lot of things; see the above-linked article for a
more detailed description.
<p>
<h4>Multi-tier, multi-generational LRU</h4>
<p>
Perhaps the largest change since the first posting of this work is the
concept of "tiers", which are used to subdivide the generations of
pages which, in turn, facilitates better decisions about which pages to
reclaim, especially on systems where a lot of buffered I/O is taking place.
Specifically, tiers are a way of sorting the pages in a generation 
by the frequency of accesses — but only accesses made by way of file
descriptors.  When a page first enters a generation, it normally goes into
tier&nbsp;0.  If some process accesses that page via a file descriptor, the
page's usage count goes up and it will move to tier&nbsp;1.  Further
accesses will push the page into higher tiers; the actual tier number is
the base-2 log of the usage count.
<p>
Before looking at how these tiers are used, it is worth asking why they are
managed this way — why are only file-descriptor-based accesses counted?
One possible reason is never mentioned in the patch set or discussion, but
seems plausible: accesses via file-descriptor will happen as the result of
a system call and are relatively easy and cheap to count.  Direct accesses
to memory by the CPU are more costly to track and cannot reasonably be
monitored with the same resolution.
<p>
The other reason, though, is that this mechanism enables some changes to
how the aging of pages brought in via I/O is done.  In current kernels, a
page that is brought into memory as the result of, say, a <tt>read()</tt>
call will initially be added to the inactive list.  This makes sense
because that page will often never be used again.  Should there be another
access to the page, though, it will be made active and the kernel will try
to avoid reclaiming it.  This mechanism works better than its predecessors,
but it is still possible for processes doing a lot of I/O to flush useful
pages out of the active list, hurting the performance of the system.
<p>
Doing better involves making use of the existing shadow-page tracking in
the kernel.  When pages are reclaimed for another use, the kernel remembers,
for a while, what those pages contained and when the old contents were
pushed out.  If one of those pages is accessed again in the near future,
requiring it to be brought back in from secondary storage,
the kernel will notice this "refault", which is a signal that actively used
pages are being reclaimed.  As a general rule, refaults indicate thrashing,
which is not a good thing.  The kernel can
respond to excessive refaulting by, for example, making the active list larger.
<p>
The multi-generational LRU work tweaks the shadow entries to record which
tier a page was in when it was reclaimed.  If the page is refaulted, it can
be restored to its prior tier, but the refault can also be counted in
association with that tier.  That allows the computation of
the refault rate for each tier — what percentage of pages being reclaimed
from that tier are being subsequently refaulted back into memory?  It seems
evident that refaults on pages in higher tiers — those which are being
accessed more frequently — would be worth avoiding in general.
<p>
This refault information is used by comparing the refault rates of the
higher tiers against that of tier&nbsp;0, which contains, remember, pages
that are accessed directly by the CPU and pages that have not been accessed
at all.  If the higher tiers have a refault rate that is higher than the
tier&nbsp;0 rate, then pages in those tiers are moved to a younger
generation and thus protected (for a while) from reclaim.  That has the
effect of focusing reclaim on the types of pages that are seeing fewer
refaults.
<p>
The other piece of the puzzle is that the memory-management code no longer
automatically promotes pages on the second file-descriptor-based access, as
is done in current kernels.  Instead, pages resulting from I/O stay in the
oldest generation unless they have been moved, as the result of usage, into
a tier that is refaulting at a higher rate than directly accessed pages.
That, as Zhao explained in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAOUHufbz_f4EjtDsMkmEBbQphXj3ET+X6SM8JUPQ4b2jJmUzvA@mail.gmail.com/">this
lengthy message</a>, has the effect of preventing these pages from forcing
out directly accessed pages that are more heavily used.  That should give
better performance on systems doing a lot of buffered I/O; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/3ddd4f8a-8e51-662b-df11-a63a0e75b2bc@kernel.dk/">this
remark from Jens Axboe</a> suggests that it does indeed help.
<p>
Another change from the first version is the addition of a user-space knob
to force the eviction of one or more generations.  The purpose of this
feature appears to be to allow job controllers to make some space available
for incoming work; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210520065355.2736558-15-yuzhao@google.com/">this
documentation patch</a> contains a little more information.
<p>
<h4>Multiple patch generations</h4>
<p>
The multi-generational LRU work remains promising, and it has garnered a
fair amount of interest.  Its path into the mainline kernel still looks
long and difficult, though.  Johannes Weiner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YHcpzZYD2fQyWvEQ@cmpxchg.org/">raised a concern</a>
that was mentioned in the first article as well: the multi-generational
LRU, as implemented now, sits alongside the existing memory-management code
as a separate option, essentially giving the kernel two page-reclaim
mechanisms.  That will always be a hard sell for reasons described by
Weiner:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 It would be impossible to maintain both, focus development and
	 testing resources, and provide a reasonably stable experience with
	 both systems tugging at a complicated shared code base.
</blockquote>
<p>
So the new code would have to replace the existing system, which is a tall
order.  It would have to be shown to perform better (or, at least, not
worse) for just about any workload, at a level of confidence that would
motivate the replacement of code that has "<q>billions of hours of
production testing and tuning</q>".  The only way to do this is to merge
the changes as a series of small, evolutionary steps.  So the
multi-generational LRU patch set would have to be broken up into a series
of changes, none of which are so big that the memory-management developers
don't feel that they can be safely merged.
<p>


Over the years, the kernel has absorbed massive changes this way, but it is
not a fast or easy process.  Weiner suggested a couple of areas that could
be focused on as a way of beginning the task of getting parts of this work
upstream and making the rest easier to consider.  If this advice is
followed, some progress toward merging the multi-generational LRU could be
made in the relatively near future.  But this functionality as a whole is
likely to have to go through numerous generations of revisions before it
all makes it into a mainline kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
[Twitch] Please, God, no! An access to a page should be an access to a page regardless of whether that access came from a file descriptor operation, from a page fault, from a kernel file server, or from any other source. The kernel should not be making policy decisions based on how an application chooses to spell its resource access!<br>

The wording of the article suggests that this is not a policy decision so much as a &quot;we measure what we can measure&quot; decision. Nobody wants to fire an interrupt handler on every single (userspace) memory access. If it came in via a page fault, then that would imply that it was previously not in memory and did not have a frequency count in the first place. If it got refaulted, then it should be counted, and the article says that it is counted.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the change you are proposing.<br>

I guess the kernel could randomly sprinkle access restrictions over a selection of userspace pages, on architectures that support it.  When a process tries to access that page, it gets a memory protection fault.  The kernel updates a usage count for the page, removes the restriction, and lets the process continue.  As long as only one in a million page requests gets faulted in this way, it might not noticeably affect performance.  The question is whether it&#x27;s possible, and whether it would give high quality information on what pages are being used.<br>

In practice, there is no way to track how many times a page has been accessed via page tables mapping it.<br>

Remark 1: a refault, *a page fault* or a buffered read is exactly one<br>
memory reference. A page table reference as how we count it, i.e., the<br>

the accessed bit for a mapped page and PageReferenced() for an<br>

It&#x27;s a little hard to compare numbers of fd-based accesses with numbers of direct accesses; you generally read a bunch of data with one syscall and then do multiple reads out of anonymous memory, but you don&#x27;t generally bother to copy parts of a mmapped file into anonymous memory.<br>
<p>
How you perform your accesses kind of has to matter in order to make sense, regardless: is a 4096-byte read from a page the same number of accesses as 4096 1-byte reads from the page, or as 1 1-byte read from the page?<br>

I think the problem here is the &quot;number of accesses&quot; metric. All that matters for predicting how likely the page is to be needed in the future is whether the page *was* accessed (over some predetermined interval), not the number of read() calls or the number of bytes read.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; … is a 4096-byte read from a page the same number of accesses as 4096 1-byte reads from the page, or as 1 1-byte read from the page?</font><br>
<p>
In my opinion: both. A single 4096-byte read, 4096 separate 1-byte reads, and a single 1-byte read (all within a single sample interval) should all be weighted the same for determining whether to keep the page in RAM. Of course the final decision should be based on multiple sample intervals, not just one sample. A better metric might be how long the page has gone without any access vs. how many times the data has been faulted back into RAM after being discarded.<br>

I like the technical aspect of this work, but doesn&#x27;t it feel like users under tight memory constraint is steering the development? Yes, I know they are the majority now, e.g. Android phones and cloud providers, but what&#x27;s the frequency of page out on our laptops? One page per week?<br>
<p>
This is like the opposite of I/O scheduler situation, where users with very fast NVMEs drives it.<br>

Windows XP and spinning rust used to grind to a halt on heavy memory use, and Win10 puts a device out of action for hours upgrading and patching itself if you still have a rotating hard disk.<br>
<p>
That&#x27;s more about the latency of storage access. What is the current advice about RAM and swap? I ask because, since having NAND-based SSD&#x27;s with block overwriting concerns, I&#x27;ve disabled swap and bought large amounts of RAM so that apps can&#x27;t get stroppy about memory pressure. Only recently have I configured zswap but it&#x27;s not noticeably changed my experience.<br>
<p>
I think that this is something that should involve running user-experience items at elevated nice levels and using the alt-sysrq keys to safely OOM-kill and then unmount filesystems if you can&#x27;t recover the device.<br>
<p>
Are we still advocating for swap in 2021?<br>

maybe I&#x27;m lucky, I haven&#x27;t hit XP halt even once with celeron1.7 + 845G + 256RAM + HDD . IIRC, I&#x27;ve run many apps which definitely exceeds 256MB,  it got slower, but never stop responding.  <br>

we all know windows update isn&#x27;t good, but we&#x27;re talking about high memory pressure, not a bad system update.  <br>

<p>
it doesn&#x27;t apply if laptop have none-replacable ram. and  memory leak (maybe by accident) can eat as much ram as you have.  of course better hardware can resolve many software problems, but should it stop kernel improve experience on old hardware ? while slower-bigger storage is still cheaper than faster-smaller storage, swap is always needed (that&#x27;s why bcache/lvm-cache exist)<br>

I would argue the opposite. With disk space as fast and cheap as it is now, why not have a 1:1 mapping between swap and RAM with /proc/sys/vm/swappiness set to 100? With a kernel that believes in over committing memory, being able to blow away the entire working set in an instant is a positive. My QoL has vastly improved on my linux workstation after I give it gobs of swap, since I no longer worry about it thrashing a tiny swap file as the OOM killer desperately looks for an alternative to firefox to knife.<br>

      My recommendation is to have no swap if the backing device is a HDD.  Why?  If the system needs so much RAM that it starts swapping, it becomes unusable anyway.

<p>With an SSD, swap may be more viable.  And if you swap rarely, don't worry about the limited number of SSD writes possible.  If you swap often, buy more RAM.

I have 2 comments for this thread, both regarding HDD and SSD.<br>
<p>
First, for HDD: I&#x27;m the guy who posted the testimonial that the v3 of the patches refers to, and I am using HDD. So, just in case anyone&#x27;s wondering about behavior on HDD specifically, here it is.<br>
<p>
Second, for SSD: I see here an attitude that once you create a SWAP on SSD, all problems are gone. So here&#x27;s my experience: this is not true.<br>
<p>
My gf has a Macbook 2013 with SSD, 4G RAM, ZSWAP. She always had swap-partition on the SSD. Before I went out to try the patches on her laptop, she have also had frequent SWAP-storms, her overall experience was pretty bad.<br>
<p>
After I configured her system to use the multi-LRU patches (v2), her experience improved a lot. Now the only moment when lags start appearing is when her SWAP usage goes to around 7-8G (Idk why exactly that size).<br>
<p>
So, for anyone out there thinking creating a SWAP on SSD will magically solve any need in the memory reclaim rework — that ain&#x27;t true.<br>

The building blocks are similar: the access recency, the access frequency and shadows/ghosts.<br>
<p>
The fundamental arguments are different: the multigenerational lru argues that pages that have been used only once (if we are sure) are always the best choice, no matter how recent they were used, because 1) even some of them are not, they will be protected upon the second access; 2) the cost to ascertain whether the rest are better or not is higher (to do so we probably have to scan more than half a million pages on a 4GB laptop under moderate pressure, and there is no guarantee we&#x27;d make better choices after we have done it).<br>
<p>
Essentially, ZFS ARC is a *cache* replacement implementation, which discovers page accesses reactively by hooks. For *page* replacement, we have to scan page tables proactive, which is far more difficult and expensive in terms of discovering page accesses.<br>

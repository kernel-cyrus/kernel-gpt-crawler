<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The conversion of the kernel's memory-management subsystem over to <a
href="/Articles/849538/">folios</a> was never going to be done in a day.
At a plenary session at the start of the second day of the 2023 <a
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Matthew Wilcox discussed the current
state and future direction of this work.  Quite a lot of progress has been
made — and a lot of work remains to be done.
<p>
There is no single best page size for the management of memory in a Linux
system, Wilcox began.  On some benchmarks, using 64KB pages produces
significantly better results, but others do better with 4KB base pages.  In
general, though, managing a system with 4KB pages is inefficient at best;
at that size, the kernel must scan through millions of <tt>page</tt>
structures to provide basic management functions.  Beyond that, the
<tt>page</tt> structure is badly overloaded and difficult to understand.
If it needs to grow for one page type, it must grow for all, meaning in
practice that it simply cannot grow, because somebody will always push back
on it.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931795/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/MatthewWilcox-sm.png" alt="[Matthew Wilcox]"
title="Matthew Wilcox" class="rthumb"></a>

To address this problem, Wilcox and others are trying to split <tt>struct
page</tt> into a set of more specialized structures.  Eventually <tt>struct
page</tt> itself will shrink to a single pointer, where the
least-significant bits are used to indicate what type of usage-specific
structure is pointed to.  The work to <a href="/Articles/871982/">move
slab-allocator information</a> out of <tt>struct page</tt> has already been
completed.  There are plans (in varying states of completion) to make
similar changes for pages representing page tables, compressed swap
storage, <a href="/Articles/348886/">poisoned</a> pages, folios, free
memory, device memory, and more.
<p>
When will this work be done?  Wilcox waved his hands and said "two years" to
general laughter.  There have been 1,087 commits in the mainline so far that
mentioned folios.  The page cache has been fully converted, as have the
slab allocators.  The tail-page portion of <a
href="/Articles/619514/">compound pages</a> has been moved to folios,
allowing the removal of another section from <tt>struct page</tt>.  The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc1/source/include/linux/fs.h#L375"><tt>address_space_operations</tt>
structure</a> has been converted — except for three functions that will
soon be deleted entirely.
<p>
There are three filesystems (XFS, AFS, and EROFS) that have been fully
converted, as have the iomap and netfs infrastructure layers.  A number of
other filesystems, including ext4, NFS, and tmpfs, can use single-page
folios now.  The <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> family of functions uses folios
internally, though its API is still based on <tt>struct page</tt>.  Much
of the internal memory-management code has been converted.  One might be
tempted to think that this work is nearly done, but there is still a lot of
code outside of the memory-management layer that uses <tt>struct page</tt>
and will need to be converted.
<p>
Every conversion that is done makes the kernel a little smaller, Wilcox
said, due to the simplifying assumption that there are no pointers to tail
pages.  Over time, this shrinkage adds up.
<p>
There are plenty of topics to discuss for the future, he said.  One is the
conversion of the buffer-head layer, which is in progress (and which was
the subject of the next session).  Folios will make it easier to support
large filesystem block sizes.  The <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> interfaces
need to be redesigned, and there are more filesystem conversions to do.  A
big task is enabling multi-page anonymous-memory folios.  Most of the work
done so far has been with file-backed pages, but anonymous memory is also
important.
<p>
One change that is worth thinking about, he said, is reclaiming the
<tt>__GFP_COMP</tt> allocation flag.  This flag requests the creation of a
compound page (as opposed to a simple higher-order page); that results in
the addition of a bunch of metadata to the tail pages.  This is useful for
developers working on kernel-hardening projects, who can use it to
determine if a copy operation is overrunning the underlying allocation.
They would like the kernel to always create compound pages and simply drop
non-compound allocations so, Wilcox suggested, the page allocator could
just do that by default and drop the <tt>__GFP_COMP</tt> flag entirely.
<p>
He mentioned some pitfalls that developers working on folio conversions
should be aware of.  Some folio functions have different semantics than the
page-oriented functions they replace; the return values may be different,
for example.  These changes have been carefully thought about, he said, and
result in better interfaces overall, but they are something to be aware of
when working in this area.
<p>
Multi-page folios can also cause surprises for code that is not expecting
them.  He mentioned filesystems that check for the end of a file by
calculating whether an offset lands within a given page; now they must be
aware that it could happen anywhere within a multi-page folio.  Anytime a
developer encounters a definition involving the string <tt>PAGE</tt>
(<tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt>, for example), it is time to be careful.  And so on.
<p>
There are also, he concluded, a few misconceptions about folios that are worth
clearing up.  One of those is that there can be only one lock per folio; he
confessed that he doesn't quite understand why there is confusion here.
There was always just one lock per compound page as well.  The page lock is
not highly contended; whenever it looks like a page lock is being
contended, it is more likely to be an indication of threads waiting for I/O
to complete.
<p>
Some developers seem to think that dirtiness can only be tracked at the
folio level.  It is still entirely possible to track smaller chunks within
a folio, though; that is up to the filesystem and how it handles its
memory.  The idea that page poisoning affects a whole folio is also
incorrect; that is a per-page status.
<p>
As the session wound down, David Hildenbrand said that, while folios are
good, there is still often a need to allocate memory in 4KB chunks.
Page-table pages, he said, would waste a lot of memory if allocated in
larger sizes.  What is really needed is the ability to allocate in a range
of sizes, depending on how the memory will be used.  Wilcox closed the
session by saying that is exactly the outcome that the developers are
working toward.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The hugepage situation is desperately in need of cleanup. The transparent-hugepages fiasco poisoned the well, so systems and programs have devolved to static provisioning; can we ever recover? We need programs not to need to know anything about them, so they just get used automatically whenever that would be useful, as they now (apparently) have in FreeBSD. In particular, hugepagefs should end up synonymous with tmpfs, and mapping a regular file on any filesystem, most particularly a .so, should get them automatically anywhere they would fit.<br>

There's no option to disable or control the use of large folios. Once the filesystem supports them, the page cache decides how large to make them.<br>
<p>
Hugetlbfs does need to go away, but that's a big job as it has grown features like reservations and page table sharing which need to be made generic.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; We need programs not to need to know anything about them, so they just get used automatically whenever that would be useful, as they now (apparently) have in FreeBSD.</span><br>
<p>
Is this what "transparent" means in THP, when programs don't need to know about mappings pagetables?<br>
<p>
It would be nice if kernel provided some guarantees without countless knobs some of them are global:<br>
<p>
1) get mapping sizes,<br>
<p>
2) get mapping, include flags which <br>
a) specify mapping sizes in order of preference,<br>
b) specify how hard kernel has to work to get one (similar to GFP_KERNEL vs GFP_ATOMIC),<br>
this flag basically says "do everything up and including to starting filesystem writeback".<br>
<p>
For example: "dd bs=2MB" may try to get 2MB buffer, quickly get ENOMEM on fragmented machine and fallback to 4KB pages.<br>
<p>
Another example: video game may do "mmap((size_t[]){2&lt;&lt;20}, MAP_DWIM);",<br>
because it wants some for internal allocators (gamedev hates malloc), and<br>
2MB is important so that performance doesn't degrade visibly.<br>
<p>
3) mremap could change underlying pagetable size in theory<br>

The way this actually works for your dd case is that we see a 2MB read, try to allocate a 2MB folio. If that fails, we fall down the orders; 2x1MB, 4x512kB, etc. We use the GFP flags that will wake kswapd, but not do direct reclaim.<br>
<p>
Some minor modifications to that if the 2MB read is not 2MB aligned in the file.<br>
<p>
What's more interesting is when the dd is, say 1kB blocks. Readahead kicks in and we start using 16kB, then 64kB, then 256kB folios. This works out really well, although I'm sure the algorithm could be tuned better. There's no reasoning behind the current one other than "try to use large folios to test the rest of the code".<br>

<p>
Is it 2MB page underneath?<br>
<p>
dd might be bad example because it doesn't really process the data just dmaing back and forth, rsync is better.<br>

For those who haven't adapted to the new naming yet, yes ;-)<br>
<p>
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/mm_types.h#n265">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/...</a><br>

* A folio is a physically, virtually and logically contiguous set<br>
 * of bytes.  It is a power-of-two in size, and it is aligned to that<br>
 * same power-of-two.  It is at least as large as %PAGE_SIZE.  If it is<br>
 * in the page cache, it is at a file offset which is a multiple of that<br>
 * power-of-two.  It may be mapped into userspace at an address which is<br>
 * at an arbitrary page offset, but its kernel virtual address is aligned<br>
 * to its size.<br>
<p>
So a folio is the new name for "potentially compound page". A folio pointer points either to a head page or an order-0 page.<br>
<p>
It doesn't really matter what the application is, a read() call is a read call. The only hint we take from the application is the length of the read (and it's only a hint; we may choose other size folios based on our own determination)<br>

Can you really blame them? SLAB and SLUB are essentially the same thing, one is just user space.<br>

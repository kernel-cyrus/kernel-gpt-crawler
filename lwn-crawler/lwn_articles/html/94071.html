<h1>Software suspend: and then there were two</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 21, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
Software suspend has long been one of the problem areas in the Linux
kernel.  Despite multiple available implementations, truly reliable,
out-of-the-box support for suspending a system to disk and (crucially)
restoring it again is still missing.  The return of one long-missing
developer may help to improve things, however.
<p>
Pat Mochel is the author of much of the power management and device model
code in the 2.6 kernel.  At one point in his efforts, his communications
with software suspend ("swsusp") maintainer Pavel Machek broke down.  In response,
Patrick created his own fork of the software suspend code, which he called
"pmdisk."  The pmdisk code went into the kernel, and a small amount of work
was done on it, but then Pat got busy with other things and vanished from
the kernel development community.  Nobody else was working on pmdisk, so
the effort simply stalled.  Pavel has discussed its removal from the kernel
more than once, but that has not ever happened.
<p>
Just in time for the Kernel Summit, Pat  returned with <a
href="/Articles/94063/">a 25-part patch set</a>.  Pat now believes that he
made a mistake by forking the software suspend code, and is trying to make
up.  So his patch set removes pmdisk from the 2.6 kernel - but not before
merging its best parts into the existing swsusp code base.  With this patch
set, swsusp is significantly cleaned up and more firmly integrated into the
kernel's power management subsystem.  This code base, Pat hopes, will prove
a good starting place for further work toward respectable software suspend
support. 
<p>
There is one other player in this game, however: the swsusp2 work done by
Nigel Cunningham and others.  This code, which forked from swsusp some time
ago, exists as a out-of-tree patch.  It is, however, by many accounts, the
most featureful and reliable software suspend implementation available for
Linux.  Swsusp2 offers a more polished display, the ability to abort the
suspend operation, and more.  Nigel has recently been making noises about
trying to merge swsusp2 into the 2.6 mainline.
<p>
The last time this topic came up, there was a significant amount of
resistance.  All versions of swsusp feature a "refrigerator," which is a
mechanism for cooling off all processes in the system before suspending the
system itself.  The swsusp2 refrigerator has seen significant amounts of
work intended to keep the system from refrigerating processes which might
still be needed by other parts of the system before it is suspended.  The
result is a large number of macro calls interspersed through the rest of
the kernel marking places where a process should not be refrigerated.
These changes make the swsusp2 patch relatively intrusive; they also create
a new kind of critical section within the kernel which looks hard to
maintain over the long run.
<p>
The current feeling, as reflected at the kernel summit, is that much of
Nigel's work cannot be merged in its current form.  It also needs to be
split into a set of small, incremental patches before it can be
considered.  Hopefully this work will happen, however; swsusp2 has things
to offer.  If its best features can be merged in with swsusp, perhaps the
kernel may yet move from three unreliable software suspend implementations
to a single version which actually works.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm curious about the integration plans.  Are you planning to merge with<br>Pat's changes and then with the mainline kernel or will one of the patch<br>sets be merged with mainline and then the other?  And are there any<br>conflicting changes which won't be able to exist in the same code base?<br>Inquiring minds want to know ;)

      From the coverage, it looks to me like the<br>two current mainline <br>implementations will merge first, since that code is already cooked and <br>the patches ready to integrate.  That would also bring an immediate <br>benefit in the form of simplification of the current two implementations <br>into one, lessening code bloat and simplifying the task of later <br>integration of swsuspend2. <br> <br>Of course, that's all in how I read the LWN coverage.  I could be reading <br>it wrong. <br> <br>As for swsuspend2, I read that its the only one that does SMP, which <br>interests me since I've a dual Opteron system here as my desktop.  (Yes, <br>it's fast! I've put that speed to good use running Gentoo, stage-one <br>compiled from source, and just freshly updated to KDE 3.3.0-beta2 today. <br>=:^)  It'd be nice to be able to reliably suspend it and shut the fans and <br>the like off, since it's in my bedroom, and it IS a dual Opteron, with all <br>the cooling requirements that means. &lt;g&gt; <br> <br>I recently discovered, to my GREAT surprise, that hardware suspend to RAM <br>seems to work on this system -- with one caveat -- upon recovery, my time <br>is all screwed up, as it doesn't advance with the hwclock over suspend and <br>naturally the software time doesn't advance either.  The /real/ <br>complicating factor there is that I've been running NTP, and it <br>would /really/ skew its compensation factor if it tried to do a time sync <br>in /that/ state! <br> <br>Anyway, now that I know hardware suspend to RAM /can/ work, when I get <br>time, I'm hoping to throw an NTP service shutdown script into the suspend <br>sequence, and an NTPClient fast-sync script into the resume, b4 restarting <br>the NTP service itself. <br> <br>That said, I'd STILL like to be able to suspend to disk, and be able to <br>entirely power off the system, and swsuspend2 seems my only chance at <br>that, at this point, tho I've been hesitant to look into it as it'd be my <br>first off-main patch, and I generally catch all the full releases and part <br>of the rcs, and an out-of-tree patch would mean either slowing down on <br>that, or potentially large amounts of work to keep it merged, particularly <br>given the rumored intrusiveness of the patch.  I'd be /very/ happy to see <br>it merged into mainline, however, /particularly/ if it works for my dual <br>Opteron! <br> <br>Duncan

      Hi.<p>Duncan's reply is right. The two in-kernel versions are being merged first. There are already patches in the -mm tree.<p>After the dust has settled, I'll push my patches.<p>Right now I'm preparing the last feature changes to suspend2 before merging: adding support for resuming an initrd and making suspend modular. This will allow encrypted storage of an image (the encryption can be set up from the initrd), and will also allow at least some upgrades to suspend to be done without rebooting the system. The system I'm running right now has LZF, GZIP and swapwriter support compiled as modules. I just need to get the core done.<p>Regards,<p>Nigel

      I'd really love to see swsusp2 in the mainline kernel. It rocks.<br>I've been playing around with a different init concept - based on a minit extension i wrote - that would even allow stopping services not needed when the system is suspended (freeing memory and thus making suspend faster and easier). Unfortunately this isn't in a state of being published; i hope i could find some time during summer break, but i fear i won't.

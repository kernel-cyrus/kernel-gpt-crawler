<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 1, 2013</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 2013 LSFMM Summit, 
Btrfs developer Josef Bacik gave an update on the status of the
filesystem.  It has seen a lot of changes over the last year, he said, with
around 800 changesets being merged.  He contrasted that with ext4, which
has seen around 250.
There are a number of features being worked on, including <a
href="http://sensille.com/qgroups.pdf">subvolume quota groups [PDF]</a> and
a new <a href="/Articles/474790/">restriper</a> to use when adding more
disks to a RAID filesystem.  

<p>
The performance of Btrfs is now roughly the same as ext4
and twice that of XFS on spinning disks, Bacik said.  On Fusion-io devices
it is "abysmally slow", about the same as XFS.  That is caused by the way
that <tt>fsync()</tt> works&mdash;"write wait, write wait"&mdash;which he
is hoping 
to get around by using 
<a href="/Articles/548116/">atomic writes</a>.  This is for workloads using
direct I/O, which is awful for 
Btrfs.  In particular, writing 4K then doing an <tt>fsync()</tt> is
something of a worst case for Btrfs.
</p>

<p>
The problems with handling full filesystems are "kind of an ongoing thing",
Bacik 
said.  There always seems to be something broken in that path.  On the
other hand, <a href="/Articles/506244/">send/receive</a> is working well,
and defragmentation is working better.  The extended inode references
(IREF) problem has been fixed.  That limited the number of hard links to a
specific inode in a
directory to two in the worst case, and only 40 in the best case.  It is
now only limited by disk space. 
</p>

<p>
RAID 5/6 has finally been merged, he said.  It is not power-failure-safe
yet, though that fix is coming soon.  It requires a format change, which
has delayed it somewhat.  The code for replacing a broken drive is "much
cleaner and faster".  It is also a lot easier for administrators to use.
There is an <tt>fsck</tt>, now, that does work and fixes problems in the
filesystem.  It checks the extent trees and checksum trees along with the
free space in the filesystem.  There is also <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Btrfs-image">btrfs-image</a>
tool for creating an image of a Btrfs partition.
</p>

<p>
A new release of Btrfs will be coming soon, Bacik said.  There will
hopefully be more steady releases in the future, not just of the mainline
code, but also the utilities in btrfsprogs.
</p>

<p>
Running out of space (i.e. <tt>ENOSPC</tt>) has been a big problem for
Btrfs, though he thinks 
there is now a solution for it.  Basically, the filesystem never knows how much
space metadata is going to take, so it seriously overestimates.  The fix
will be a special "chunk" in the log where any overflow goes.
</p>

<p>
Online deduplication has gone through a couple of iterations.  It will
probably go into the 3.11 kernel, Bacik said.  It will not be the default,
and will require a format change before it can be turned on.  Offline
deduplication can be done in user space.
</p>

<p>
In answer to the "are we there yet?" question, Bacik said that we would be
by the "end of the year".  He has 
said that for the last three years now, but is getting more comfortable
that it really is stabilizing.  In the past, he has never had time to work
on features because he has been fixing bugs, but there are fewer bugs to
fix now.  There are also a bunch of user-space tools to help "if things go
horribly wrong".  The <tt>ENOSPC</tt> problem should be handled in the next
few months. 

<p>
Toward the end of this year, or early next year, the project
can start talking to distributions about becoming the default filesystem
for new installations.  Beyond that, performance is the next big focus for
the team, he concluded.

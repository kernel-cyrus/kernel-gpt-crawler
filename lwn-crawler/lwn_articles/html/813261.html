<p>
The "kernel runtime security instrumentation" (KRSI) patch set has been
making the rounds over the past few months; the idea is to use the Linux
security module (LSM) hooks as a way to detect, and potentially deflect,
active attacks against a running system.
It does so by allowing BPF programs to be attached to the LSM hooks.  That has
caused <a href="/Articles/808048/">some concern</a> in the past about exposing the
security hooks as external kernel APIs, which makes them potentially
subject to the "don't break user space" edict. But 
there has been no real objection
to the goals of KRSI.  The fourth version
of the patch set was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200220175250.10795-1-kpsingh@chromium.org/">posted</a>
by KP Singh on February&nbsp;20; the concerns raised this time are about
its impact on the LSM infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
The main change Singh made from the previous version effectively removed
KRSI from the standard LSM calling mechanisms by using <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fec56f5890d9">BPF
"fexit" (for 
function exit)
trampolines</a> on the LSM hooks.  That trampoline can efficiently call any BPF
programs that have been placed on the hook without the overhead associated
with the normal LSM path; in particular, it avoids the cost of the <a
href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">retpoline</a>
mitigation for the Spectre hardware vulnerability.  The KRSI hooks are enabled by <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/static-keys.txt">static
keys</a>, which means they have zero cost when they are not being used.
But it does mean that KRSI looks less like a normal LSM as Singh
acknowledged: "<q>Since the code does not deal with security_hook_heads anymore, it goes
  from 'being a BPF LSM' to 'BPF program attachment to LSM hooks'.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Casey Schaufler, who has done a lot of work on the LSM infrastructure
over the last few years, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/0ef26943-9619-3736-4452-fec536a8d169@schaufler-ca.com/">objected</a>
to making KRSI a special case, however: "<q>You aren't doing anything
so special that the general mechanism won't work.</q>"  Singh <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200221114458.GA56944@google.com/">agreed</a> that
the standard LSM approach would work for KRSI, "<q>but the cost of an
indirect call for all the hooks, even those that are completely unused
is not really acceptable for KRSI’s use cases</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202002211946.A23A987@keescook/">focused</a> on the
performance issue, noting that making calls for each of the hooks, even
when there is nothing to do, is common for LSMs.  Of the 230 hooks defined
in the LSM interface, only SELinux uses more than half (202), Smack is next
(108), and the rest use less than a hundred—several use four or less.  He
would like to see some numbers on the performance gain from using static
keys to disable hooks that are not 
required.  It might make sense to use that mechanism for all of LSM, he said.
Singh <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200224172309.GB21886@chromium.org/">agreed</a>
that it would be useful to have some performance numbers; "<q>I will do
some analysis and come back with the numbers.</q>"  It is, after all, a
bit difficult to have a discussion about improving performance without some
data to guide the decision-making.
</p>

<p>
There are several intertwined pieces to the disagreement.  The LSM
infrastructure has generally not been seen as a performance bottleneck, at
least until the advent of KRSI; instead, over recent years, the focus has
been on generalizing that infrastructure to support <a
href="/Articles/804906/">arbitrary stacking of multiple LSMs</a> in a
running system.  That has improved the performance of handling calls into
multiple hooks (when more than one LSM defines one for a given operation)
over the previous mechanism, but it was not geared to the high-performance 
requirements that KRSI is trying to bring to the LSM world.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the stacking work has made it so that LSMs can be stacked in
any order;  each defined hook for a given operation is called in order, the
first that denies the operation "wins" and the operation fails without
calling any others.  That infrastructure is in place, but KRSI upends it to
a certain extent.  KRSI comes from the BPF world, so the list traversal and
indirect calls used
by the LSM infrastructure are seen as performance bottlenecks.  KRSI always
places itself (conceptually) last on the list and uses the BPF trampoline
to avoid that overhead.  That makes it a special case, unlike the other
"normal" stackable LSMs, but that may be a case of a premature
optimization, as Cook noted.
</p>

<p>
BPF developer Alexei  Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200223220833.wdhonzvven7payaw@ast-mbp/">does not
see it as "premature"</a> at all, however. "<q>I'm convinced that
avoiding the cost of retpoline in critical path is a 
requirement for any new infrastructure in the kernel.</q>"  He thought
that the LSM infrastructure should consider using static keys to enable its
hooks, and that the mechanism employed by KRSI should be used there:
<div class="BigQuote">
Just compiling with CONFIG_SECURITY adds "if (hlist_empty)" check
for every hook. Some of those hooks are in critical path. This load+cmp
can be avoided with static_key optimization. I think it's worth doing.
<p>
[...] I really like that KRSI costs absolutely zero when it's not enabled.
Attaching BPF prog to one hook preserves zero cost for all other hooks.
And when one hook is BPF powered it's using direct call instead of
super expensive retpoline.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But the insistence on treating KRSI differently than the other LSMs means
that perhaps KRSI should go its own way—or work on improving the LSM
infrastructure as a whole.  Schaufler <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c5c67ece-e5c1-9e8f-3a2b-60d8d002c894@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>
that he had not "<q>gotten that memo</q>" on avoiding retpolines and
that the LSM infrastructure is not new.  He is interested in looking at
using static keys, but is concerned that the mechanism is too specific to
use in the general case, where multiple LSMs can register hooks to be
called:
<div class="BigQuote">
I admit to being unfamiliar with the static_key implementation,
but if it would work for a list of hooks rather than a singe hook,
I'm all ears.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The new piece is not KRSI per se, Singh <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200224171305.GA21886@chromium.org/">said</a>, but
the ability to attach BPF programs to the security hooks <i>is</i> new.
There are techniques available to make that have zero cost, so it makes
sense to use them:
<div class="BigQuote">
There are
  other tracing / attachment [mechanisms] in the kernel which provide
  similar [guarantees] (using static keys and direct calls) and it
  seems regressive for KRSI to not leverage these known patterns and
  sacrifice performance [especially] in hotpaths. This provides users
  to use KRSI alongside other LSMs without paying extra cost for all
  the possible hooks.
<p>
[...] My analogy here is that if every tracepoint in the kernel were of the
type:
<pre>
if (trace_foo_enabled) // &lt;-- Overhead here, solved with static key
   trace_foo(a);  // &lt;-- retpoline overhead, solved with fexit trampolines
</pre>
It would be very hard to justify enabling them on a production system,
and the same can be said for BPF and KRSI.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The difficulty is that the LSM interface came about under a different set
of constraints, Schaufler <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/00c216e1-bcfd-b7b1-5444-2a2dfa69190b@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>.
Those constraints have changed over time and the infrastructure is being worked on to
improve its performance, but it still needs to work with the existing LSMs:
<div class="BigQuote">
The LSM mechanism is not zero overhead. It never has been. That's why
you can compile it out. You get added value at a price. You get the
ability to use SELinux and KRSI together at a price. If that's unacceptable
you can go the route of seccomp, which doesn't use LSM for many of the
same reasons you're on about.
<p>
When LSM was introduced it was expected to be used by the lunatic fringe
people with government mandated security requirements. Today it has a
much greater general application. That's why I'm in the process of
bringing it up to modern use case requirements. Performance is much
more important now than it was before the use of LSM became popular.
<p>
[...] If BPF and KRSI are that performance critical you shouldn't be
tying them to LSM, which is known to have overhead. If you can't
accept the LSM overhead, get out of the LSM. Or, help us fix the
LSM infrastructure to make its overhead closer to zero. Whether
you believe it or not, a lot of work has gone into keeping the LSM
overhead as small as possible while remaining sufficiently general
to perform its function.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The goal of eliminating the retpoline overhead is reasonable, Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202002241136.C4F9F7DFF@keescook/">said</a>, but the
LSM world has not yet needed to do so. "<q>I think it's a desirable goal, to be
sure, but this does appear to be an early optimization.</q>"  He noted
there is something of an impedance mismatch; the BPF developers do not want
to see any performance hit associated with BPF, but the LSM developers
"<q>do not want any new special cases in 
LSM stacking</q>".  So he suggested adding a "slow" KRSI that used the
LSM stacking infrastructure as it is today, followed by work to optimize
that calling path.
</p>

<p>
But Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200225054125.dttrc3fvllzu4mx5@ast-mbp/">thought</a>
that KRSI should perhaps just go its own way.  He proposed changing the BPF
program type from <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM</tt> to
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_OVERRIDE_RETURN</tt> and moving KRSI completely out of the
LSM world: "<q>I don't see anything in LSM infra that KRSI can
reuse.</q>"  He does not see a slow KRSI as an option and suggested that
perhaps the LSM interface and the new BPF program type should be made
mutually exclusive at kernel build time:
<div class="BigQuote">
 It may seem as a downside that it will force a choice
on kernel users. Either they build the kernel with CONFIG_SECURITY and their
choice of LSMs or build the kernel with CONFIG_BPF_OVERRIDE_RETURN and use
BPF_PROG_TYPE_OVERRIDE_RETURN programs to enforce any kind of policy. I think
it's a pro not a con.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, lots of users of the LSM interface, including most
distributions, so it might difficult to go that route, Schaufler <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/4b56177f-8148-177b-e1e5-c98da86b3b01@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>.
But Singh <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200226051535.GA17117@chromium.org/">noted</a> that
the users of a <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_OVERRIDE_RETURN</tt> feature may be highly
performance-sensitive such that they already disable LSMs "<q>because of
the current performance characteristics</q>".
But Singh did <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200225193108.GB22391@chromium.org/">think</a>
that <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_OVERRIDE_RETURN</tt> might be useful on
its own,
separate from the KRSI work; he plans to split that out into its own patch
set.  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200225192913.GA22391@chromium.org/">agreed</a>
with Cook's approach, as well, and plans to re-spin the KRSI patches to use
the standard LSM approach as a starting point; "<q>we can follow-up on
performance</q>". 
</p>

<p>
The clash here was the classic speed versus generality tradeoff that pops
up in the kernel (and elsewhere) with some frequency.  The BPF developers
are laser-focused on their "baby"—and squeezing every last drop of
performance out of it—but there is a wider world in kernel-land, some parts
of which have different requirements.  It would seem that a reasonable
compromise has been found here.  Preserving the generality of the LSM
approach while gaining the performance improvements that the BPF developers
have been working on would be a win for both, really—taking the kernel and
its users along for the ride.

Your post was saying it was still in the same niche. Regardless of Android's status, it's still using SELinux, this it's pretty easy to say it has acquired widespread use and more notably on consumer devices.<br>
<p>
Even then, RHEL uses SELinux by default and has widespread use in enterprise.<br>

Yet Android is a niche system, it's not a general-purpose operating system. It's specifically designed for one particular use-case with all the design decisions being guided by it.<br>

You would have to discount Android, Chrome OS, RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, CoreOS and several others<br>
<p>
There are more mobile/tablet/chromebook users using their devices for all sorts of things.  I think that would qualify as general purpose anyway<br>

Sure. As I said, Android or CoreOS are basically examples of NSA-like crazy environments. They are specifically designed to be inflexible with as few tuning knobs accessible by end-users (or application developers) as possible.<br>
<p>
It's no wonder that SELinux can work within these environments.<br>

SELinux still fails within environments that require flexibility or extensibility.<br>

Reading this thread gives me the impression that you talked about niche usage not knowing it was widely used and are now calling anything that uses it a niche usage just to avoid admitting you're wrong. I may be wrong of course, but your definition of niche usage seems very unusual. I'd say your usage of niche is a niche usage.<br>

I've used Scientific Linux (6, 7) and CentOS (8) with SELinux enforcing (on 7 and 8; can't remember about 6) for 6+ years. Works fine for me. I find it a well documented and implented feature.<br>

As a binary rebuild of RHEL, Scientifix Linux supports whatever the equivalent RHEL does.<br>

The problem is that SL doesn't do anything with SELinux. If you use it as a RHEL rebuild it works just as RHEL.<br>
<p>
However, plenty of software doesn't support it. Like SUN (RIP) Grid Engine forks, or good old Hadoop.<br>

Again... "niche" and billions just don't seem to fit together. If you're wanting to contrast with "general purpose" why not just use the term "special purpose"?<br>

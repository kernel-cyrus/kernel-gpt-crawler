One of the problems with relying on out-of-tree kernel code is that one can
never be sure when that code might be updated for newer kernels.  Keeping
up with the kernel can be painful even for maintainers of small patches;
it's much more so for those who maintain a large, invasive patch series.
It is probably safe to say that, if the realtime preemption developers do
not keep their patches current, there are very few other developers who are
in a position to take on that work.  So it was certainly discouraging for
some realtime users to watch multiple kernel releases go by while the
realtime patch series remained stuck at 2.6.33.
<p>
The good news is that the roadblock has been overcome and there is now a
new realtime tree for the 3.0 kernel.  Even better news is that the
realtime developers may have come up with a solution for one of the most
vexing problems keeping the realtime code out of the mainline.  The only
potential down side is that this approach relies on an interesting
assumption about how per-CPU data is used; this assumption will have to be
verified with a lot of testing and, likely, a number of fixes throughout
the kernel.
<p>
Symmetric multiprocessing systems are nice in that they offer equal access
to memory from all CPUs.  But taking advantage of the feature is a guaranteed
way to create a slow system.  Shared data requires mutual exclusion to
avoid concurrent access; that means locking and the associated bottlenecks.
Even in the absence of lock contention, simply moving cache lines between
CPUs can wreck performance.  The key to performance on SMP systems is
minimizing the sharing of data, so it is not surprising that a great deal
of scalability work in the kernel depends on the use of per-CPU data.
<p>
A per-CPU variable in the Linux kernel is actually an array with one
instance of the variable for each processor.  Each processor works with its
own copy of the variable; this can be done with no locking, and with no
worries about cache line bouncing.  For example, some slab allocators
maintain per-CPU lists of free objects and/or pages; these allow quick
allocation and deallocation without the need for locking to exclude any
other CPUs.  Without these per-CPU lists, memory allocation would scale
poorly as the number of processors grows.
<p>
Safe access to per-CPU data requires a couple of constraints, though: the
thread working with the data cannot be preempted and it cannot be migrated
while it manipulates per-CPU variables.  If the thread is preempted, the
thread that replaces it could try to work with the same variable; migration
to another CPU could cause confusion for fairly obvious reasons.  To avoid
these hazards, access to per-CPU variables is normally bracketed with
calls to <tt>get_cpu_var()</tt> and <tt>put_cpu_var()</tt>; the
<tt>get_cpu_var()</tt> call, along with providing the address for the
processor's version of the variable, disables preemption.  So code which
obtains a reference to a per-CPU data will not be scheduled out of the CPU
until it releases that reference.  Needless to say, any such code must be
atomic.
<p>
The conflict with realtime operation should be obvious: in the realtime
world, anything that disables preemption is a possible source of unwanted
latency.  Realtime developers want the highest-priority process to run at
all times; they have little patience for waiting while a low-priority
thread gets around to releasing a per-CPU variable reference.  In the past,
this problem has been worked around by protecting per-CPU variables with
spinlocks.  These locks keep the code preemptable, but they wreck the
scalability that per-CPU variables were created to provide and complicate the
code.  It has been clear for some time that a different solution would need
to be found.
<p>
With the <a href="/Articles/452266/">3.0-rc7-rt0</a> announcement, Thomas
Gleixner noted that "<q>the number of sites which need to be patched is
way too large and the resulting mess in the code is neither acceptable nor
maintainable.</q>"  So he and Peter Zijlstra sat down to come up with a
better solution for per-CPU data.  The solution they came up with is
surprisingly simple: whenever a process acquires a spinlock or obtains a
CPU reference with <tt>get_cpu()</tt>, the scheduler will refrain from
migrating that process to any other CPU.  That process remains preemptable
- code holding spinlocks can be preempted in the realtime world - but it
will not be moved to another processor.
<p>
Disabling migration avoids one clear source of trouble: a process which is
migrated in the middle of manipulating a per-CPU variable will end up
working with the wrong CPU's instance of that variable.  But what happens
if a process is preempted by another process that needs to access the same
variable?  If preemption is no longer disabled, this unfortunate event
seems like a distinct possibility.
<p>
After puzzling over this problem for a bit, the path to enlightenment
became clear: just ask Thomas what they are thinking with this change.  What they are
thinking, it turns out, is that any access to per-CPU data needs to be
protected by some sort of lock.  If need be, the lock itself can be
per-CPU, so the locking need not reintroduce the cache line bouncing that
the per-CPU variable is intended to prevent.  In many cases, that locking
is already there for other purposes.
<p>
The realtime developers are making the bet that this locking is already
there in almost every place where per-CPU data is manipulated, and that the
exceptions are mostly for data like
statistics used for debugging where an occasional error is not really a
problem.  When it comes to locking, though, a gut feeling that things are
right is just not good enough; locking problems have a way of lurking
undetected for long periods of time until some real damage can be done.
Fortunately, this is a place where computers can help; the realtime tree
will probably soon acquire an extension to the locking validator that
checks for consistent locking around per-CPU data accesses.
<p>
Lockdep is very good at finding subtle locking problems which are difficult
or impossible to expose with ordinary testing.  So, once this extension has
been implemented and the resulting problem reports investigated and
resolved, the assumption that all per-CPU accesses are protected by locking
will be supportable.  That process will likely take some time and,
probably, a number of fixes to the mainline kernel.  For example, there may
well be bugs now where per-CPU variables are manipulated in interrupt
handlers but non-interrupt code does not disable interrupts; the resulting
race will be hard to hit, but possibly devastating when it happens.
<p>
So, as has happened before, the realtime effort is likely to result in
fixes which improve things for non-realtime users as well.  Some churn will
be involved, but, once it is done,
there should be a couple of significant benefits: the realtime kernel will
be more scalable on multiprocessor systems, and the realtime patches should
be that much closer to being ready for merging into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It sounds like you need to take a lock before taking a per-CPU lock.  I sort of hope the former is not per-CPU, but things could get amusing if it were.<br>

<p>
Interesting summary of how the Shared Memory concept works generally speaking (not).<br>
<p>
Such minimization happens "naturally" when data passing has to be explicit. The latter scales, has 10 times less bugs, and can be debugged.<br>
<p>
SMP hardware is optimized for dangerous code (and it relies on some form of messaging at the lowest, cache-coherency level).<br>

I haven't looked at the code, but if you're requiring get_cpu to be protected by a lock, then could you change the signature to require the lock to be passed in? It need not actually *do* anything with the lock.<br>

      Preemption is disabled; that naturally disables migration as well.

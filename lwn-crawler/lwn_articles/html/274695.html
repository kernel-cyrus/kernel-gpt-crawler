An API should refrain from making promises that it cannot keep.  A recent
episode involving the kernel's <tt>in_atomic()</tt> macro demonstrates how
things can go wrong when a function does not really do what it appears to
do.  It is also a good excuse to look at an under-documented (but
fundamental) aspect of kernel code design.
<p>
Kernel code generally runs in one of two fundamental contexts.  Process
context reigns when the kernel is running directly on behalf of a (usually)
user-space process; the code which implements system calls is one example.
When the kernel is running in process context, it is allowed to go to sleep
if necessary.  But when the kernel is running in atomic context, things
like sleeping are not allowed.  Code which handles hardware and software
interrupts is one obvious example of atomic context.  
<p>

There is more to it than that, though: any kernel function moves into
atomic context the moment it acquires a spinlock.  Given the way spinlocks
are implemented, going to sleep while holding one would be a fatal error;
if some other kernel function tried to acquire the same lock, the system
would almost certainly deadlock forever.  
<p>

"Deadlocking forever" tends not to appear on users' wishlists for the
kernel, so the kernel developers go out of their way to avoid that
situation.  To that end, code which is running in atomic context carefully follows a
number of rules, including (1)&nbsp;no access to user space, and,
crucially, (2)&nbsp;no sleeping.  Problems can result, though, when a
particular kernel function does not know which context it might be invoked
in.  The classic example is <tt>kmalloc()</tt> and friends, which take an
explicit argument (<tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> or <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt>) specifying
whether sleeping is possible or not.
<p>

The wish to write code which can work optimally in either context is
common, though.  Some developers, while trying to write such code, may well
stumble across the following definitions from
<tt>&lt;linux/hardirq.h&gt;</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    /*
     * Are we doing bottom half or hardware interrupt processing?
     * Are we in a softirq context? Interrupt context?
     */
    #define in_irq()	   (hardirq_count())
    #define in_softirq()   (softirq_count())
    #define in_interrupt() (irq_count())

    #define in_atomic()	   ((preempt_count() &amp; ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != 0)
</pre>
<p>
It would seem that <tt>in_atomic()</tt> would fit the bill for any
developer trying to decide whether a given bit of code needs to act in an
atomic manner at any specific time.  A quick grep through the kernel
sources shows that, in fact, <tt>in_atomic()</tt> has been used in quite a
few different places for just that purpose.
There is only one problem: those uses are almost certainly all wrong.  
<p>

The <tt>in_atomic()</tt> macro works by checking whether preemption is
disabled, which seems like the right thing to do.  Handlers for events like
hardware interrupts will disable preemption, but so will the
acquisition of a spinlock.  So this test appears to catch all of the cases
where sleeping would be a bad idea.  Certainly a number of people who have
looked at this macro have come to that conclusion.
<p>
But if preemption has not been configured into the kernel in the first
place, the kernel does not raise the "preemption count" when spinlocks are
acquired.  So, in this situation (which is common - many distributors still
do not enable preemption in their kernels), <tt>in_atomic()</tt> has no way
to know if the calling code holds any spinlocks or not.  So it will return
zero (indicating process context) even when spinlocks are held.  And that
could lead to kernel code thinking that it is running in process context
(and acting accordingly) when, in fact, it is not.  

<p>
Given this problem, one might well wonder why the function exists in the
first place, why people are using it, and what developers can really do to
get a handle on whether they can sleep or not.  Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/274699/">answered the first question</a> in a relatively
cryptic way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	in_atomic() is for core kernel use only.  Because in special
	circumstances (ie: kmap_atomic()) we run inc_preempt_count() even
	on non-preemptible kernels to tell the per-arch fault handler that
	it was invoked by copy_*_user() inside kmap_atomic(), and it must
	fail.
</div>
<p>
In other words, <tt>in_atomic()</tt> works in a specific low-level
situation, but it was never meant to be used in a wider context.  Its
placement in <tt>hardirq.h</tt> next to macros which <i>can</i> be used
elsewhere was, thus, almost certainly a mistake.  As <a
href="/Articles/274701/">Alan Stern pointed out</a>, the fact that <i>Linux
Device Drivers</i> recommends the use of <tt>in_atomic()</tt> will not have
helped the situation.  Your editor recommends that the authors of that book
be immediately sacked.
<p>
Once these mistakes are cleared up, there is still the question of just
how kernel code should decide whether it is running in an atomic context or
not.  The real answer is that it just can't do that.  <a
href="/Articles/274703/">Quoting Andrew Morton</a> again:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 The consistent pattern we use in the kernel is that callers keep
	 track of whether they are running in a schedulable context and, if
	 necessary, they will inform callees about that.  Callees don't
	 work it out for themselves.
</div>
<p>
This pattern <i>is</i> consistent through the kernel - once again, the GFP_
flags example stands out in this regard.  But it's also clear that this practice has
not been documented to the point that kernel developers understand that
things should be done this way.  Consider <a
href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/2008/03/18#2008-03-18">this recent
posting</a> from Rusty Russell, who understands these issues better than
most:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This flag indicates what the allocator should do when no memory is
	immediately available: should it wait (sleep) while memory is freed
	or swapped out (GFP_KERNEL), or should it return NULL immediately
	(GFP_ATOMIC). And this flag is entirely redundant: kmalloc() itself
	can figure out whether it is able to sleep or not.
</div>
<p>
In fact, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> cannot figure out on its own whether sleeping
is allowable or not.  It has to be told by the caller.  This rule is
unlikely to change, so expect a series of <tt>in_atomic()</tt> removal
patches starting with 2.6.26.  Once that work is done, the
<tt>in_atomic()</tt> macro can be moved to a safer place where it will not
create further confusion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmm... if in_atomic only has one or two narrow, valid uses, perhaps it shouldn't be a macro at
all?  Either a small, static function in the one source file that uses it?  GCC will still
inline it, but the static declaration would send the signal "not for outside consumption."

Hmmm... it looks like something to be called by a "per-arch" files, so even "one use" actually
lives in multiple files. :-)

I guess it belongs in a header, but I still wonder if it shouldn't have a different name.

      Perhaps instead of changing the name, change the macro so that it means what it says at all levels. Different calling files set a different value to some symbol, which indicates to the header which type of atomic context you're thinking about.
<p>
Then all you need do is ensure that (a) there's a way to know whether the context is atomic or not, and (b) the same method is used across that file and across any includes that may be brought in by that file.
<p>
Alternatively, you could have two parallel kernels, one always atomic, the other always not. Then you'd never need to test at all. Although you would have the communications problem from hell that all parallel solutions suffer from.

If you follow Andrew Morton's reasoning, "am I in atomic" is something a caller should never
ask.  It should be told explicitly, as in the case of kmalloc().

The case where "in_atomic" is getting used "legitimately" is in a fault handler (which should
not be a fastpath pretty much by definition).  It sounds like they're abusing preempt_count to
coax a particular behavior out of the fault handler, rather than just stating the intended
behavior directly.  That doesn't necessarily sound like clean design to me, but rather an
overly clever hack.

I'm sure someone more familiar with this mechanism can explain why it is or is not a good
mechanism.

I guess this argues for building your kernels with pre-emption enabled, at least until 2.4.26.

There are many cases where admitting you are wrong and suggesting a punishment preempts
someone else suggesting a more suitable punishment. I'm suggesting flogging is a suitable
punishment. Well, not really, I was just caught up in the entertainment value of a good
flogging. 

In reality, writing is a severe form of self-flagellation and I am grateful our editor
subjected himself to it. I first bought the Second Edition of Lunux Device Drivers, bought the
Third Edition as soon as I saw it was out, and will buy the Fourth Edition as soon as I learn
of its existence.

      <p>My guess is &quot;Get Free Page&quot; (with various qualifier suffixes, i.e. GFP_KERNEL, GFP_ATOMIC, GFP_DMA, etc.).</p>

<p>It's strange that, after nearly an hour of grepping files throughout the entire Linux source tree, I was unable to come up with a meaning.  My search took me all over the mm/, include/linux/, Documentation/, and kernel/ directories, but to no avail.  The meaning of GFP_KERNEL via a Google search (going five pages deep) was equally elusive!</p>

<p>I suppose there are many kernel developers out there who know its true meaning whilst snickering over my frustrated search...</p>

      <p>I was right!  And to think I extrapolated &quot;get free page&quot; from the context of where I found a bunch of <font face="monospace">GFP_</font>* macros in my search.  Thank you, Dale77.</p>

<p>For those with further interest, the <font face="monospace">GFP_</font>* macros appear to be a set of bitmasks, many of which are defined as bitwise-ORed versions of others (ref. &lt;Linux source&gt;/include/kernel/gfp.h).  These are used to set parameters to allocating virtual memory (and what to do in case of failure).  But, I'm certain a lot of LWN readers already know this.</p>

<p>I have  a lot to learn about the internal workings of the Linux kernel, as well as my online search skills--I'm certain a search here at LWN would have led me to that link.</p>

You are (of course) correct.  Damn, but it was such a beautiful example; 
the same one I used in 2003 in my OLS keynote, and noone spotted it then 
either.

Thanks,

<P>
At least you're in good company. ;-)

<P>
A somewhat analogous "discovery" involved the thread-(non)safety of the
double-checked locking pattern in C++, which various people (possibly including Scott <I>Effective C++</I> Meyers himself) espoused for some years prior to the publication of an <A HREF="http://www.aristeia.com/Papers/DDJ_Jul_Aug_2004_revised.pdf"
>article describing its problems</A> [PDF].

Couldn't this be problematic in the case of systems that use intrusion detection? One
technique that I am familar with is the use of MD5 sums of system binaries, to check if they
have been tampered with. Directly modifying binaries would make this prefetch technique
incompatible with systems that do MD5 checking.

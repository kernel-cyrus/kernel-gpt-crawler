</div>
One of the memory-management subsystem's most important jobs is reclaiming
unused (or 
little-used) memory so that it can be put to better use.  When it comes to
one of the core memory-management data structures — page tables — though,
this subsystem often falls down on the job.  At the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), David Hildenbrand led a
session on the problems posed by the lack of page-table reclaim and
explored options for improving the situation.
<p>
Page tables, of course, contain the mapping between virtual and physical
addresses; every virtual address used by a process must be translated by the
hardware using a page-table entry.
These tables are arranged in a hierarchy, three to five levels
deep, and can take up a fair amount of memory in their own right.  On an
x86 system, a 2TB mapping will require 4GB of bottom-level page tables, 8MB
of the next-level (PMD) table, and smaller amounts for the higher-level
tables.  These tables are not swappable or movable, and sometimes get in
the way of operations like hot-unplugging memory.
<p>
Page tables are reclaimed by the memory-management subsystem in some cases
now.  For example, removing a range of address space with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>munmap()</tt></a> 
will clean up the associated page tables as well.  But there are situations
that create empty page tables that are not reclaimed.  Memory allocators
tend to map large ranges, for example, and to only use parts of the range
at any given time.  When a given sub-range is no longer needed, the

<a href="/Articles/893758/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/DavidHildenbrand-sm.png" alt="[David
Hildenbrand]" title="David Hildenbrand" class="rthumb"></a>

allocator will use <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
to release the pages, but the associated
page tables will not be freed.  Large mapped files can also lead to empty
page tables.  These are all legitimate use cases, and they can be
problematic enough; it is also easy to write a
malicious program that fills memory with empty page tables and brings the
system to a halt, which is rather less legitimate.
<p>
In all of these cases, many of the resulting page tables are empty and of
no real use; they could be reclaimed without harm.  One step in that direction,
Hildenbrand said, is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220429133552.33768-1-zhengqi.arch@bytedance.com/">this
patch set from Qi Zheng</a>.  It adds a reference count (<tt>pte_ref</tt>)
to each page table page; when a given page's reference count drops to zero,
that page can be reclaimed.
<p>
Another source of empty page-table pages is mappings to the shared zero
page.  This is a page maintained by the kernel, containing only zeroes,
which is used to initialize anonymous-memory mappings.  The mapping is
copy-on-write, so user space will get a new page should it ever write to a
page mapped in this way.  It is easy for user space to create large numbers
of page-table entries pointing to the zero page, once again filling memory with
unreclaimable allocations.  This can be done, for example, by simply
reading one byte out of every 2MB of address space mapped as anonymous
memory. These page-table pages could also be easily
reclaimed, though, if the kernel were able to detect them; there is no
difference (as far as user space can tell) between a page-table page filled
with zero-page 
mappings and a missing page-table page.  At worst, the page-table page
would have to be recreated should an address within it be referenced again
from user space.

<p>
There are other tricks user space can use to create large numbers of
page-table pages.  Some of them, like so many good exploits, involve the
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
system call. 
<p>
So what is to be done?  Reclaiming empty page-table pages is "low-hanging
fruit", and the patches to do so already exist.  The kernel could also
delete mappings to the zero page while scanning memory; that would
eventually empty out page-table pages containing only zero-page mappings,
and allow those to be reclaimed as well.  Ordinary reclaim unmaps
file-backed pages, which can create empty page-table pages, but that is not
an explicit objective now.  It might be possible to
get reclaim to focus on pages that are close to each other in the hopes of
emptying out page-table pages, which could then be reclaimed as well.
<p>
There are some other questions to be answered as well, though.
Some page-table pages may be actively used, even if they just map the zero
page; reclaiming them could hurt performance if they just have to be
quickly recreated again.  There are also questions
about whether it makes sense to reclaim higher-level page tables.
Reclaiming empty PMD pages might be worthwhile, Hildenbrand said, but there is
unlikely to be value in trying to go higher.
<p>
When should this reclaim happen?  With regard to empty page-table pages,
the answer is easy — as soon as they become empty.  For zero-page mappings,
the problem is a little harder.  They can be found by scanning, but that
scanning has its own cost.  So perhaps this scanning should only happen
when the kernel determines that there is suspicious zero-page activity
happening.  But defining "suspicious" could be tricky.  Virtual machines
tend to create a lot of zero-page mappings naturally, for example, so that
is not suspicious on its own; it may be necessary to rely on more
subjective heuristics.  One such might be to detect when a process has a
high ratio of page-table pages to its overall resident-set size.
<p>
Even when a removable page-table page has been identified, he said,
removing it may not be trivial.  There is a strong desire to avoid
acquiring the <tt>mmap_lock</tt>, which could create contention issues;
that limits when these removals can be done.  Removing higher-level
page-table pages is harder, since ordinary scanning can hold a reference to
them for a long time.  Waiting for the reference to go away could stall the
reclaim process indefinitely.
<p>
With regard to what can be done to defeat a malicious user-space process,
Hildenbrand said that the allocation of page-table pages must be throttled
somehow.  The best way might be to enforce reclaim of page-table pages
against processes that are behaving in a suspicious way.  One way to find
such processes could be to just set a threshold on the amount of memory
used for page-table pages, but that could perhaps be circumvented simply by
spawning a lot of processes.
<p>
At this point, the session wound down.  Yang Shi suggested at the end that
there might be some help to be found in the <a
href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational LRU</a> work, if
and when that is merged.  It has to scan page tables anyway, so adding the
detection of empty page-table pages might fit in relatively easily.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There must be something I&#x27;m missing here with regard to malicious processes.<br>

<p>
Are the page tables used by a process not charged to it in memory accounting? If so, it seems like a malicious process which makes lots of page tables can be dealt with in the same way as a malicious process which allocates lots of memory. If not, why not?<br>

Hi,<br>
<p>
considering cgroups, page tables are charged that way already, towards the total memory consumption of a cgroup. In cgroup v1 there is an additional &quot;kmem&quot; accounting to track+limit such kernel allocations separately, which seems to no longer exist in v2. So in v2 you can only limit the total memory consumption of a cgroup.<br>
<p>
In general, the issue is that page tables are unmovable and unswappable. In environments where neither matters (e.g., no swap, no memory hotunplug, no THP, no memory compaction), there is no real difference to movable and swappable user pages.<br>
<p>
However, usually we care about the difference, for example, when using swap for memory overcommit or having memory in the system managed by ZONE_MOVABLE for memory hotunplug or memory defragmentation. As page tables cannot go to swap or cannot be placed on ZONE_MOVABLE, malicious processes can trigger OOM or negatively affect the performance of other workloads in setups, simply by primarily consuming primarily unmovable and unswappable memory via page tables.<br>

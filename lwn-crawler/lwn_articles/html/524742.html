<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 14, 2012</br>
           </div>
One of the nice features of virtual memory is that applications do not have to
concern themselves with how much memory is actually available in the
system.  One need not try to get too much work done to realize that some
applications (or their developers) have taken that notion truly to heart.
But it has often been suggested that the system as a whole would work
better if interested applications could be informed when memory is tight.
Those applications could react to that news by reducing their memory
requirements, hopefully heading off thrashing or out-of-memory situations.
The latest proposal along those lines is a new system call named
<tt>vmpressure_fd()</tt>; it is unlikely to be merged in its current form,
but it still merits a look.
<p>
The idea behind Anton Vorontsov's <a
href="/Articles/524299/"><tt>vmpressure_fd()</tt> 
patch set</a> is to create a mechanism by which
the kernel can inform user space when the system is under memory pressure.
An application using this call would start by filling out a
<tt>vmpressure_config</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/vmpressure.h&gt;

    struct vmpressure_config {
    	__u32 size;
	__u32 threshold;
    };
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>size</tt> field should hold the size of the structure; it is there
as a sort of versioning mechanism should more fields be added to the
structure in the future.  The <tt>threshold</tt> field indicates the
minimum level of 
notification the application is interested in; the available levels are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>VMPRESSURE_LOW</tt></dt>
<dd>
	The system is out of free memory and is having to reclaim pages to
	satisfy new allocations.  There is no particular trouble in
	performing that reclamation, though, so the memory pressure, while
	non-zero, is low.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>VMPRESSURE_MEDIUM</tt></dt>
<dd>
	A medium level of memory pressure is being experienced — enough,
	perhaps, to cause some swapping to occur.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>VMPRESSURE_OOM</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Memory pressure is at desperate levels, and the system may be about
	to fall prey to the depredations of the out-of-memory killer.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
An application might choose to do nothing at low levels of memory pressure,
clean up some low-value caches at the medium level, and clean up everything
possible at the highest level of pressure.  In this case, it would probably
set <tt>threshold</tt> to <tt>VMPRESSURE_MEDIUM</tt>, since notifications
at the <tt>VMPRESSURE_LOW</tt> level are not actionable.
<p>
Signing up for notifications is a simple matter:
<p>
<pre>
    int vmpressure_fd(struct vmpressure_config *config);
</pre>
<p>
The return value is a file descriptor that can be read to obtain pressure
events in this format:
<p>
<pre>
    struct vmpressure_event {
        __u32 pressure;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The current interface only supports blocking reads, so a <tt>read()</tt> on
the returned file descriptor will not return until a pressure notification has
been generated.  Applications can use <tt>poll()</tt> to determine whether
a notification is available; the current patch does not support
asynchronous notification via the SIGIO signal.
<p>
Internally, the virtual memory subsystem has no simple concept of memory
pressure, so the patch has to add one.  To that end, the "reclaimer
inefficiency index" is calculated by looking at the number of pages
examined by the reclaimer and how many of those pages could <i>not</i> be
reclaimed.  The need to look at large numbers of pages to find reclaim
candidates indicates that reclaimable pages are getting hard to find — that
the system is under memory pressure in other words.  The index is simply
the ratio of reclamation failures to the number of pages examined,
expressed as a percentage.
<p>
This percentage is calculated over a "window" of pages examined; by
default, it is generated each time the reclaimer looks at 256 pages.  This
value can be changed by tweaking the new <tt>vmevent_window</tt> sysctl
knob.  There are also controls to set the levels at which the various
notifications occur: <tt>vmevent_level_medium</tt> (default 60) and
<tt>vmevent_level_oom</tt> (default 99); the "low" level is wired at zero,
so it will trigger anytime that the system is actively looking for pages to
reclaim. 
<p>
An additional mechanism exists to detect the out-of-memory case, since it
can be hard to distinguish it using just the reclaimer inefficiency index.
The reclaim code includes the concept of a "priority" which controls how
aggressive it can be to reclaim pages; its value starts at 12 and falls
over time as attempts to locate enough pages fail.  If the priority falls
to four (by default; it can be set with the
<tt>vmevent_level_oom_priority</tt> knob), the system is deemed to be
heading into an out-of-memory state and the notification is sent.
<p>
Some reviewers questioned the need for a new system call.  We already have
a system call — <tt>eventfd()</tt> — that exists to create file descriptors
for notifications from the kernel.  Actually using <tt>eventfd()</tt> tends
to involve an interesting dance where the application gets a file
descriptor from <tt>eventfd()</tt>, opens a sysfs file, and writes the file
descriptor number into 
the sysfs file to connect it to a specific source of events.  But it is
an established pattern that might be best maintained here.  Another
reviewer <a href="/Articles/524745/">suggested</a> using the perf events
subsystem, but Anton <a href="/Articles/524747/">believes</a>, not without
reason, that perf brings a lot of complexity to something that should be
relatively simple.
<p>
The other complaint has to do with the integration (or lack thereof) with
the "memcg" control-group-based memory usage controller.  Memcg already has
a notification 
mechanism (described in <a
href="/Articles/516022/">Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt</a>) 
that can inform a process when a control group is running out of
memory; it might make sense to use the same mechanism for this purpose.
Anton <a href="/Articles/524748/">responded</a> that the memcg mechanism
does not provide the same information, it does not account for all memory
use, and that it requires the use of control groups — not always a popular
kernel feature.  Still, even if <tt>vmpressure_fd()</tt> is merged as a
separate mechanism, it will at least have to be extended to work at the
control group level as well.  The code shows that this integration has been
thought about, but it has not yet been implemented.
<p>
Given these concerns, it seems unlikely that the current patch set will
find its way into the mainline.  But there is a clear desire for this kind
of functionality in all kinds of use cases from very large systems to very
small ones (Anton's patches were posted from a linaro.org address).  So,
one way or another, a kernel in the near future will probably have the
ability to inform processes that it is experiencing some memory pressure.
The next challenge will then be getting applications to use those
notifications and reduce that pressure.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

From reading other lwn articles, I get the distinct impression that memcg will be used for the entire system, even if there are no other instances of it. This way the base system gets the memcg interfaces just like a container does.  <br>
<p>
This seems to make more sense, and have a higher chance of being an interface that will better last the test of time.<br>

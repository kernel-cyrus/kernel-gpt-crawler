<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 13, 2009</br>
           </div>
Back in 2005, Andrea Arcangeli, mostly known for memory management work in
those days, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/120647/">wandered into the
security field</a> with the "secure computing" (or "seccomp") feature.
Seccomp was meant to support <a href="http://cpushare.com/">a side business
of his</a> which would enable owners of Linux systems to rent out their
CPUs to people doing serious processing work.  Allowing strangers to run
arbitrary code is something that people tend to be nervous about; they
require some pretty strong assurance that this code will not have general
access to their systems.
<p>
Seccomp solves this problem by putting a strict sandbox around processes
running code from others.  A process running in seccomp
mode is severely limited in what it can do; there are only four system
calls - <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>exit()</tt>, and
<tt>sigreturn()</tt> - available to it.  Attempts to call any other system
call result in immediate termination of the process.
The idea is that a control process could obtain the code to be run and load
it into memory.  After setting up its file descriptors appropriately, this
process would call:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, 1);
</pre>
<p>
to enable seccomp mode.  Once straitjacketed in this way, it would jump
into the guest code, knowing that no real harm could be done.  The guest
code can run in the CPU and communicate over the file descriptors given to
it, but it has no other access to the system.
<p>
Andrea's CPUShare never quite took off, but seccomp remained in the
kernel.  Last February, when a security hole was found in the seccomp code,
Linus <a href="/Articles/332976/">wondered</a> whether it was being used at
all.  It seems likely that there were, in fact, no users at that time, but
there was one significant prospective user: Google.
<p>
Google is not looking to use seccomp to create a distributed computing
network; one assumes that, by now, they have developed other solutions to
that problem.  Instead, Google is looking for secure ways to run plugins in
its <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> browser.  The Chrome
<a
href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox">sandbox</a>
is described this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Sandbox leverages the OS-provided security to allow code execution
	that cannot make persistent changes to the computer or access
	information that is confidential. The architecture and exact
	assurances that the sandbox provides are dependent on the operating
	system. Currently the only finished implementation is for Windows. 
</div>
<p>
It seems that the Google developers thought that seccomp would make a good
platform on which to create a "finished implementation" for Linux.  Google
developer Markus Gutschke <a href="/Articles/332982/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Simplicity is really the beauty of seccomp. It is very easy to
	verify that it does the right thing from a security point of view,
	because any attempt to call unsafe system calls results in the
	kernel terminating the program. This is much preferable over most
	ptrace solutions which is more difficult to audit for correctness.
<p>
	The downside is that the sandbox'd code needs to delegate execution
	of most of its system calls to a monitor process. This is slow and
	rather awkward. Although due to the magic of clone(), (almost) all
	system calls can in fact be serialized, sent to the monitor
	process, have their arguments safely inspected, and then executed
	on behalf of the sandbox'd process. Details are tedious but we
	believe they are solvable with current kernel APIs.
</div>
<p>
There is, however, the little problem that sandboxed code
can usefully (and safely) invoke more than the four allowed system calls.  That limitation
can be worked around ("tedious details"), but performance suffers.  What
the Chrome developers would like is a more flexible way of specifying which
system calls can be run directly by code inside the sandbox.
<p>
One suggestion that came out was to add a new "mode" to seccomp.  The API
was designed with the idea that different applications might have different
security requirements; it includes a "mode" value which specifies the
restrictions that should be put in place.  Only the original mode has ever been
implemented, but others can certainly be added.  Creating a new mode which
allowed the initiating process to specify which system calls would be
allowed would make the facility more useful for situations like the Chrome
sandbox.
<p>

Adam Langley (also of Google) has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332438/">a patch</a> which does just that.
The new "mode&nbsp;2" implementation accepts a bitmask describing which
system calls are accessible.  If one of those is <tt>prctl()</tt>, then the
sandboxed code can further restrict its own system calls (but it cannot
restore access to system calls which have been denied).  All told, it looks
like a reasonable solution which could make life easier for sandbox
developers.
<p>
That said, this code may never be merged because the discussion has since
moved on to other possibilities.  Ingo Molnar, who has been arguing for the
use of the ftrace framework in a number of situations, <a
href="/Articles/332986/">thinks that ftrace is a perfect fit</a> for the
Chrome sandbox problem as well.  He might be right, but only for a version
of ftrace which is not, yet, generally available.
<p>
Using ftrace for sandboxing may seem a little strange; a tracing framework
is supposed to report on what is happening while perturbing the situation
as little as possible.  But ftrace has a couple of tools which may be
useful in this situation.  The system call tracer is there now, making it
easy to hook into every system call made by a given process.  In addition, the current
development tree (perhaps destined for 2.6.31) includes an event filter
mechanism which can be used to filter out events based on an arbitrary
boolean expression.  By using ftrace's event filters, the sandbox could go beyond
just restricting system calls; it could also place limits on the arguments
to those system calls.  An <a href="/Articles/332987/">example</a> supplied
by Ingo looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    { "sys_read",		"fd == 0" },
    { "sys_write",		"fd == 1" },
    { "sys_sigreturn",		"1" },
    { "sys_gettimeofday",	"tz == NULL" },
</pre>
<p>
These expressions implement something similar to mode 1 seccomp.  But,
additionally, <tt>read()</tt> is limited to the standard input and
<tt>write()</tt> to the standard output.  The sandboxed process is also
allowed to call <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>, but it is not given access to the
time zone information.  
<p>
The expressions can be arbitrarily complex.  They are also claimed to be
very fast; Ingo claims that they are quicker than the evaluation of
security module hooks.  And, if straight system call filtering is not
enough, arbitrary tracepoints can be placed elsewhere.  All told, it does
seem like a fairly general mechanism for restricting what a given process
can do.
<p>

The problem cannot really be seen as solved yet, though.  The event tracing
code is very new and mostly unused so far.  It is out of the mainline
still, meaning that it could easily be a year or so until it shows up in
kernels shipped by distributions.  The code allowing this mechanism to be
used to control execution is yet to be written.  So Chrome will not have a
sandbox based on anything other than mode&nbsp;1 seccomp for some time
(though the Chrome developers are also evaluating using SELinux for this
purpose).  
<p>
Beyond that, there are some real doubts about whether system call
interception is the right way to sandbox a process.   There are well-known
difficulties with trying to verify parameters if they are stored in user
space; a hostile process can attempt to change them between the execution
of security checks and the actual use of the data.  There are also
interesting interactions between system calls and multiple ways to do a
number of things, all of which can lead to a leaky sandbox.  All of this
has led James Morris to <a href="/Articles/332990/">complain</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm concerned that we're seeing yet another security scheme being
	designed on the fly, without a well-formed threat model, and
	without taking into account lessons learned from the seemingly
	endless parade of similar, failed schemes.
</div>
<p>
Ingo is not worried, though; he notes that the ability to place arbitrary
tracepoints allows filtering at any spot, not just at system call entry.
So the problems associated with system call interception are not
necessarily an issue with the ftrace-based scheme.
Beyond that, this is a specific sort of security problem:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Your argument really pertains to full-system security solutions -
	while maximising compatibility and capability and minimizing user
	inconvenience. _That_ is an extremely hard problem with many pitfalls
	and snake-oil merchants flooding the roads. But that is not our
	goal here: the goal is to restrict execution in very brutal but
	still performant ways.
</div>
<p>

This has the look of a discussion which will take some time to play out.
There is sure to be opposition to turning the event filtering code into
another in-kernel security policy language.  It may turn out that the
simple seccomp extension is more generally palatable.  Or something
completely different could come along.  What is clear is that the
sandboxing problem is hard; many smart people have tried to implement it in
a number of different ways with varying levels of success.  There is no
assurance that that the solution will be easier this time around.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

They start out with an idea which superficially seems simple and efficient, yet once all of the hard-learned lessons of the past are applied with all of their subtleties and nuances, the end result is just some variation on an existing scheme, but without the benefit of having been closely scrutinized and shaken-out over time.<br>

It does seem like a fun project, but I shudder thinking of how the utter simplicity will be thrown out for endless complexity.  It's bad enough having a bitmask to allow arbitrary syscalls, but to then monitor syscall arguments?  Seems to me the word "security" hardly deserves to be treated so shabbily as to be associated with this.<br>

The most successful sandbox must be chroot+setuid. Probably because is it portable, simple and easy to understand. Both the administrator and the programmer knows directly what they can trust such a process with.<br>
<p>
That's why I think something like seccomp would be usable. Anything outside of pure computation must be done outside it. No flexibility, nothing. Attack vectors are isolated to the monitor process.<br>

I agree, chroot + setuid is one of the most successful models out there -- assuming you're measuring success by popularity. If you factor in effectiveness, on the other hand, I was under the impression that it's a disaster.<br>
<p>
setuid is good, but privilege escalation flaws are not that hard to come by. And once you have root privileges, chroot is no longer a security mechanism, it's just a convenient filesystem remapping trick. Nothing prevents you from creating your own special device and mounting the entire filesystem within your chroot jail. And that's only one of many, many ways to escape chroot.<br>

if you assume that privilage escalation exploits are everywhere, nothing less than a fully locked down SELinux system can do you any good (and note that _no_ distro is shipping a _fully_ locked down SELinux system)<br>
<p>
if privilage escalation exploits are not everywhere then chroot is much stronger.<br>
<p>
and even though it's not as strong as other security mechanisms could be, the fact that those other mechanisms aren't used makes them pretty useless<br>
<p>
<p>
however, I will disagree slightly with chroot being the most successful model, I'll point out that it builds on the basic unix user/group permissions, and I would call _that_ the most successful model<br>

Nothing is a security mechanism against privilege escalation flaws in the mechanism itself. That's what appeals to me with seccomp, it should be possible to be made secure, as opposed to complex stuff such as LSM- or SELinux-arbitrated access control.<br>

This google sandbox does sound like the dumbest thing ever. It's bad enough having Adobe not supplying Flash for all architectures, but actually having web content that is fundamentally x86-only makes my toes curl.<br>

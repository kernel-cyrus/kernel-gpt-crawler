<h1>Denial of reality vulnerabilities</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 12, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
On July 7, the folks at rPath sent out <a
href="http://lwn.net/Alerts/190770/">a security update</a> for a pair of
kernel vulnerabilities.  The update reads, in part:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to two
	denial of service attacks.  The first allows any local user to fill
	up file systems by causing core dumps to write to directories to
	which they do not have write access permissions.
</div>
<p>
The bug in question is designated CVE-2006-2451; it was fixed in the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/190420/">2.6.17.4</a> kernel release.  All
kernels since 2.6.13 are vulnerable, but one cannot just rely on the
nominal version number: Red Hat helpfully backported this bug into
the 2.6.9 kernel shipped with RHEL4.
<p>

Reading the description above, some system administrators may feel that
there is no particular urgency in applying this update.  The risk that a
rogue user would fill up a disk with core dump files may seem small, so an
update fixing the problem - and which requires a system reboot to be
effective - can maybe be deferred for a while.  After all, the Linux kernel
core dump code takes pains to avoid overwriting files with core dumps, so
the real potential for harm is small.  It's a denial of service bug.
<p>

Except that it's not.  All that is required is to create a program
containing a string in the format understood by <tt>cron</tt>, send it over
to <tt>/etc/cron.d</tt>, and use the bug to create a core dump there.
Eventually <tt>cron</tt> will wander along, helpfully pick the line it
understands out of the surrounding binary junk, and execute (as root) the
commands found there.  It is a simple and straightforward local root
exploit; an example implementation has been posted to the full-disclosure
list.
<p>
Paul Starzetz has posted <a href="/Articles/191089/">a complaint</a> about
the characterization of a fully-exploitable vulnerability as a denial of
service problem; he has seen this done with other vulnerabilities as well.
He is right.  "Denial of service" makes the vulnerability seem less severe,
especially if it is only exploitable locally.  Those words may cause
vulnerabilities to remain open longer by inspiring inaction on both the
administrator and distributor sides.  If a bug can be exploited for
privilege escalation, it should not be described as a denial of service
problem. 
<p>

To its credit, Red Hat (which is where the bug was discovered) notes that
the bug could be exploited to gain root privileges.  Ubuntu, which <a
href="http://lwn.net/Alerts/190954/">closed the vulnerability</a> four days
later, says "<q>This could be exploited to drain available disk space on
system partitions, or, under some circumstances, to execute arbitrary code
with full root privileges.</q>"  This advisory could use an edit as
well: "under some circumstances" makes the exploit seem unlikely or
difficult.  A more accurate wording would be "if the attacker wants."
<p>

Lest it seem that rPath and Ubuntu are receiving too much grief: as of this
writing, five days after disclosure, rPath, Ubuntu, and Red Hat are the
<i>only</i> distributors to have fixed this problem.  They have done the
most important part: making an update available.  All other
distributors who have shipped kernels based on 2.6.13 or later remain
vulnerable to a trivial local root exploit.  Might this slow response be
caused, in part, by the perception that this is a mere local denial of
service bug?
<p>

As a community, we feel that we have the best security support out there.
Vulnerabilities are not hidden, and fixes come promptly.  In cases like
this one, however, we have let our users down.  Presenting an easily
exploitable root vulnerability as a denial of service problem is just the
sort of obfuscation that we normally try to avoid.  And the fact that a
number of distributions remain vulnerable is a failure to live up to our
own promises.  We can - and must - do better than that.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
19 June 2006: Red Hat security team first aware of issue. <br>
<p>
21 June 2006: Red Hat notified kernel security team and vendor-sec (private list which other Linux vendors security teams take part in) under embargo.  We gave our working exploit showing this was a privilege escalation flaw to these groups.<br>
<p>
06 July 2006: Embargo lifted<br>

      Perhaps I'm missing something here, but couldn't it be regarded as a bug in cron that it doesn't do a basic sanity check on its configuration files, to ensure that they are actually text files...? In which case, what turns the security problem from a DoS into an easy root-hole is the interaction of two bugs, rather than either bug in isolation... ouch.<br>

      Cron is a trivial example, but there are plenty of programs that execute scripts located in particular directories of /etc (although perhaps not so often), so a bug that allows users to dump files in directories where they have no permissions I would say is inherently a priviledge escalation bug.<br>
<p>
Yes, cron could be more careful, but on the other hand, relying on unix permissions to restrict users doesn't seem like an inherent security flaw.<br>

      But most of those programs would get an error on the first "command" it found in the file of garbage and quit at that point, never able to reach the embedded command.<br>
<p>
I would think a program that keeps parsing text from the file, ignoring errors no matter how bad they are, is a security hole, as this shows. I would suspect that not just cron is at fault, I would look at every older Unix utility.<br>

      Exactly - the fact that cron can execute strings found in the middle of core files is a security issue and should be fixed at the same time.<br>

Care to name a few affected programs/services?<br>
<p>
Things that execute everything in a directory (e.g. /etc/rcX.d) are not vulnerable, because core files are not executable. I tried feeding one to bash, dash, and zsh all bombed out with errors (bash's being most wise).<br>
<p>
There may be programs as stupid as cron, but they should be fixed, if only in the interest of safety (guard against errors).<br>

      Yeah, it's not the kernel's fault that cron trusts any garbage you throw <br>
at it. So I'd say the _kernel_ problem is a denial of service issue, but <br>
the /distributions/ now have privilege escalation bugs to fix.<br>

      I'd say it's a privilege escalation kernel exploit to let non-root users write to o+rx o-w directories, generating a root-owned file, even if the filename and much of the contents can't be chosen arbitrarily.<br>

      Furthermore, are the core dump files owned by the user, or by root?<br>
<p>
If the core file is still owned by the user who ran the program, it seems like a very bad idea for cron to read files not owned by root from /etc/cron.d/.<br>

      Well, the issue is that prctl() can be used to set your program such that <br>
its core files will be written by root, regardless of who started it.<br>
<p>
The rationale behind that was that you might have a program that you want <br>
to be able to debug but that might be handling sensitive data, so prctl() <br>
lets you say "create a core file that _only_ root can read".<br>
<p>
So the denial of service thing is definitely true. The cron interaction <br>
just plain sucks.<br>

      Cron gets the username from the filename, not the actual ownership of the file. (At least, on a default Dapper, this happens for files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, where they end up if edited through crontab -e, for instance. Newer incantations seem to expect a username on the cronjob line.) 
<p>
If the user "core" does not exist, a crontab -- at least, in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, haven't investigated /etc/cron.d and friends -- called "core" will be ignored by crond and an error message indicating the failure will be logged; otherwise, its jobs, if any, are run as the user core. 
<p>
So if a user without root privileges can cause core files to be called "root", you're in trouble. On my default Dapper, this cannot be easily done -- but YMMV. ;-)
<p>
Oh, and yes, my Dapper also checks whether the file owner is actually the user indicated by the crontab filename. Phew. ;-)

<p>
Yup, it does. So also in the /etc/cron.d case, a cracker would at least need to be able to manipulate the core dump's filename as well. Which requires root privileges on my system.
<p>
Again, this bug <em>is</em> trivially exploitable. But not by just dumping core in /etc/cron.d.

Well, investigating a bit more turns up that indeed, dumping core in /etc/cron.d <em>is</em> sufficient: cron really doesn't care at all what files are called in /etc/cron.d. OMG. OMG. OMG. Jon, you were right as always.

      Perhaps part of the problem here is just that too many privileges are <br>
given to system tasks by default.  Capability (as in EROS etc) fans would <br>
certainly say so, but I think that even the possibilities available in a <br>
standard Linux system are not being fully utilised.<br>
<p>
For instance: a cron job to process man pages does not have to run as <br>
root.  If the ownership of the man pages is set to user "man", that job <br>
can be run setuid man.  cron itself can run setuid - to something which <br>
only has the privileges to execute those setuid cron scripts.<br>
<p>
I think the same could be applied to a lot of system daemons and would <br>
result in a somewhat safer system.  How many processes really need to run <br>
with root privileges?  Most just need access to a subset of files.<br>

      This editorial seems to be arguing with somebody, but whom?
<p>
I assume the descriptions of the bug as a DOS are just errors.  If the author had realized there's a way to exploit it to get privilege escalation, he would have written it up that way.  Is someone still claiming the original description is appropriate?
<p>
If it's just an editorial against making mistakes, there's not much point -- it's preaching to the converted.

      If the author HADN'T realised, then he clearly hadn't read the initial advisories, and shouldn't have been writing the official advisory.<br>

mjcox said the first announcement on the private security mailing list described it as a privilege escalation problem.<br>

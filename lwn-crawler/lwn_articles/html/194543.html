Paravirtualization is the act of running a guest operating system, under
control of a host system, where the guest has been ported to a virtual
architecture which is <i>almost</i> like the hardware it is actually running
on.  This technique allows full guest systems to be run in a relatively
efficient manner.  The highest-profile free paravirtualization
implementation remains Xen; on the proprietary side, VMWare has been active
for a long time.  Both of these efforts would like to see (at least some
of) their code in the mainline kernel.  The kernel developers, however, are
uninterested in merging a large collection of hooks specific to any one
solution.
<p>

One attempt to solve this problem, proposed by VMWare, is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/175706/">VMI interface</a>.  VMI works by
isolating any operations which may require hypervisor intervention into a
special set of function calls.  The implementation of those functions is
not built into the kernel; instead, the kernel, at boot time, loads a
"hypervisor ROM" which provides the needed functions.  The binary interface
between the kernel and this loadable segment is set in stone, meaning that
kernels built for today's implementations should work equally well on
tomorrow's replacement.  This design also allows the same binary kernel image to run
under a variety of hypervisors, or, with the right ROM, in native mode on
the bare hardware.
<p>

The fixed ABI and ability to load "binary blobs" into the kernel does not
sit well with all kernel developers, however.  It looks like another way to
put proprietary code into the kernel, which is something most kernel
hackers would rather support less of.  Plus, as Rusty Russell <a
href="/Articles/194551/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We're not good at maintaining ABIs.  We're going to be especially
	bad at maintaining an ABI when the 99% of us running native will
	never notice the breakage.
</div>
<p>
For this and other reasons, VMI has
not had a smooth path into the kernel so far.  That has not stopped VMWare
hacker Zachary Amsden from <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194016/">pushing for a binary blob
interface</a> recently on linux-kernel, however.
<p>

There have been rumblings for a while concerning an alternative hypervisor
interface (called "paravirt_ops") under development.  <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194339/">An early implementation of
paravirt_ops</a> was posted on August&nbsp;7, making the shape of this interface
 clearer.  In the end, paravirt_ops is yet another structure filled
with function pointers, like many other operations structures used in the
kernel.  In this case, the operations are the various machine-specific
functions that tend to require a discussion with the hypervisor.  They
include things like disabling interrupts, changing processor control
registers, changing memory mappings, etc.
<p>

As an example, one of the members of paravirt_ops is:
<p>
<pre>
    void (fastcall *irq_disable)(void);
</pre>
<p>
The patch also defines a little function for use by the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline void raw_local_irq_disable(void)
    {
    	paravirt_ops.irq_disable();
    }
</pre>
<p>
As long as the kernel always uses this function to disable interrupts, it
will use whatever implementation has been provided by the hypervisor which
fills in paravirt_ops.
<p>

The patch includes a set of operations for native (non-virtualized systems)
which causes the kernel to behave as it did before - or which will bring
this about, once the remaining bugs are fixed.  That kernel may be a little
slower, however, since many operations which were performed by in-line
assembly code are now, instead, done through an indirect function call.  To
mitigate the worst performance impacts, the paravirt_ops patch set includes
a self-patching mechanism to fix up some of the function calls - the
interrupt-related ones, in particular.

<p>
This interface may look a lot like VMI; both interfaces allow the
replacement of important low-level operations with hypervisor-specific
versions.  The difference is that paravirt_ops is an inherently
source-based interface, with no binary interface guarantees.  It is assumed
that this interface will change over time, as most other internal kernel
interfaces do.  In fact, since this is a relatively new area for kernel
support, chances are that paravirt_ops will be more than usually volatile
for some time.  There is
also, currently, no provision for loading the operations at run time, so
kernels must be built to work with a specific hypervisor.
<p>

On the surface, paravirt_ops thus looks like a competitor to VMI - a choice
of open, mutable kernel interfaces against binary blobs and a fixed ABI.
As it happens, however, there is a diverse set of developers working on
paravirt_ops, including representatives from Xen and, yes, VMWare.  Some of
the VMI code has found its way into the initial paravirt_ops posting.  All
of the large players appear to be behind this development - a fact which
will greatly ease its path into the kernel.
<p>

So why are the VMWare developers still pushing for a binary interface?  It
would appear that they are considering the creation of a glue layer
connecting paravirt_ops with the VMI binary interface.  This design leaves
the VMI people solely responsible for maintaining their ABI while freeing
the kernel developers to mess with paravirt_ops at will.  Some of the
relevant developers feel more at ease with the VMI interface when it is
connected this way, though there is some residual discomfort about the
possibility of linking non-GPL binary hypervisor modules into the kernel.
<p>

The paravirt_ops developers would like to get their code into the 2.6.19
kernel.  That schedule looks ambitious, given that the merge window is due
to open in a few weeks and that, as of this writing, paravirt_ops has not
yet done any time in the -mm kernel.  It is, however, an option which
should disappear entirely when configured out, so inclusion in 2.6.19 might
not be entirely out of the question.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>The hypervisor ROM thing doesn't make much sense as described.  The hypervisor ROM shouldn't be loaded into the kernel by Linux and shouldn't be code maintained by Linux developers.  It should exist permanently in the virtual machine's address space -- that's what ROM means.  It should be totally out of the control of Linux developers and under the control of the hypervisor developers, and the stability of the interface would flow directly from that fact.  Just like traditional ISA BIOS.
<p>
Ordinarily, hypervisors just offer new instructions instead of memory you can branch to (i.e. an instruction causes an interrupt which hypervisor code that is invisible to Linux handles), but I suppose hypervisor ROM might be faster or more convenient.

<p>
You are looking at it from the perspective of guest OS.  What about when <br>
Linux is the host OS?  That's what the debate is about here.<br>
<p>
An entirely user-mode host is slower than a host built with a cooperating <br>
kernel that has exposed certain bits (like interrupt control) directly to <br>
the host application.  What is being debated here is what that exposed <br>
interface should look like from the kernel as host side, and whether it <br>
will be nailed hard and fast like most regular user mode interfaces, or <br>
specifically allowed to change, as can most of the kernel other than the <br>
user mode interfaces.<br>
<p>
IOW, from the kernel as host perspective, Linux /is/ the hardware-like <br>
hypervisor ROM, with Linux developers therefore responsible for developing <br>
and maintaining that interface.  Will it be set in stone as the regular <br>
user interface, or specifically allowed to change, as a regular kernel <br>
interface like that exposed to kernel modules?<br>

<p>One may not distribute a kernel linked to a non-GPL binary module. However, then distributed seperately, everybody has the freedom to do what they want. The GPL is not about usage, only about distribution!</p>

<p>Kernel devs: <i>please</i> concentrate on continuing to write great code and <i>not</i> on limiting our freedom on what to do with it! (except our freedom to redistribute it, of course)</p>

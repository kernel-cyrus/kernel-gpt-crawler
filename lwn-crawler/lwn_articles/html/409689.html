As a general rule, kernel changes which break drivers at run time are not
seen as a good thing.  Silent data corruption is also seen as the sort of
outcome that the development community would rather avoid.  What happens
when it becomes necessary to choose one or the other?  A long-running
debate in the ARM community provides at least one answer.
<p>
First, some background.  Contemporary processors do not normally address
memory directly; instead, memory accesses are mediated through mappings
created in the hardware's memory management unit.  Depending on the processor, those
mappings may be controlled through segment registers, page table entries,
or some other means.  The mapping will translate a virtual address into a
physical address, but it also controls how the processor will access that
memory and, perhaps, cache its contents.
<p>
As <a href="/Articles/409700/">explained</a> by ARM maintainer Russell
King, ARM processors 
have a number of attributes which affect how memory mappings work.  There
is the concept of a memory type; "normal memory" is subject to reordering
of reads and writes, while "device memory" is not, for example.  There is
also a bit indicating whether memory can be shared between processors;
unshared memory is faster because there is no need to worry about
cross-processor cache coherency.  Then, like many CPUs, ARM processors can
specify different caching behavior in the mapping; RAM might be mapped with
writeback caching enabled, while device memory is uncached.
<p>
The ARM kernel maps RAM as normal memory with writeback caching; it's also
marked non-shared on uniprocessor systems.  The <tt>ioremap()</tt> system
call, used to map I/O memory for CPU use, is different: that memory is mapped as
device memory, uncached, and, maybe, shared.  These different mappings give
the expected behavior for both types of memory.  Where things get tricky is
when somebody calls <tt>ioremap()</tt> to create a new mapping for system
RAM.
<p>
The problem with these multiple mappings is that they will have differing
attributes.  As of version&nbsp;6 of the ARM architecture, the specified
behavior in that situation is "unpredictable."  Users, as a rule, are not
enamored of "unpredictable' behavior, especially when their data is
involved.  So it would make sense to avoid multiple memory mappings with
differing attributes.  The ARM architecture has traditionally allowed this
kind of mapping, though, and a number of drivers, as a result, rely on
being able to remap RAM in this way.
<p>
Back in April, Russell raised an alarm about this issue, and <a
href="http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/lurker/message/20100408.094818.d6854bd5.en.html">posted
a patch</a> causing <tt>ioremap()</tt> to fail when the target is system
RAM.  This change avoids the potential data corruption issue, but at the
cost of breaking every driver using <tt>ioremap()</tt> in this way.  There
were complaints at the time, so the patch sat out the 2.6.35 development
cycle, but Russell merged it for 2.6.36.  There it sat until, with the
release imminent, Felipe Contreras <a href="/Articles/409705/">posted a
patch</a> backing out the change, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Many drivers are broken, and there's no alternative in sight. Such
	a big change should stay as a warning for now, and only later
	should it actually fail.
</div>
<p>
Russell was not impressed.  In his view, remapping RAM in this way is a
dangerous technique which will lead to data corruption sooner or later.
Despite being warned six months ago, driver developers have not fixed the
problem - there are as many broken drivers now as there were before.  So,
he says, there is no benefit to waiting any longer; the dangerous behavior
should be stopped before somebody gets burned.
<p>
On the other side, driver developers point out that everything "seems to
work" as it is, so there is no urgent need for change.  Furthermore,
Russell's patch looks to them like an API change, and the normal rule of
kernel development is that anybody making internal API changes is charged
with cleaning up any resulting messes.  Fixing the drivers is not a trivial
task, and it's Russell's contention that they have always been broken, so
he is not willing (or necessarily able) to make them all work again.
<p>
The situation looked stalled, with a reversion of the patch looking like
the only way forward.  But, in fact, it looks like there is a way out.  The
first is to allow those mappings for one more cycle, but to put in a
user-visible warning when they happen.  As Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/409709/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We *do* have a plan: as of 2.6.36, the kernel will emit a WARN_ON
	trace when a driver does this.  Offending code will be discovered,
	developers will get bug reports from worried users, etc.  This is
	usually pretty effective.
</div>
<p>
It is the "worried users" who have been missing from the equation so far;
they can provide a type of pressure which, seemingly, is unavailable to
worried subsystem maintainers.
<p>
The other piece of the solution is to give driver developers a way to
obtain a chunk of physically-contiguous RAM which can be remapped in this
way.  Such memory cannot be mapped simultaneously as system RAM.  One nice
idea would be to simply unmap system memory when it is put to a device's
use, but that proves to be difficult to implement.  The alternative is to
just set aside some memory at boot time and never let the kernel use it for
any other purpose; drivers can then allocate from that pool when they need
to.  Russell has posted <a href="/Articles/409713/">a patch</a> which makes
this kind of memory set-aside possible.
<p>
So this particular situation will probably have a happy outcome, presuming
that the above outcome happens and that that no users are burned by
unpredictable mappings with the 2.6.36 kernel.  But it highlights some
ongoing problems.  It can be very hard to get developers to fix things,
especially if the current code "seems to work."  Those developers also
became aware of the change at a very late date - if, indeed, they are even
aware of it now.  It seems that testing of -rc kernels by developers is not
happening as much as we would like.  Still, the development process seems
to work, and problems like this are overcome eventually.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Can't the ARM guys just generalize the hard work that happened on x86 to guarantee to pages never get mapped to userspace with different attributes?<br>

warning for one cycle will do very little good. it generally takes longer than that for any distros to start using a kernel and get it into the hands of the users (and in the embedded space where ARM is so strong, it's even worse)<br>
<p>
but even if it only took a week for a distro to QA and ship a kernel, and users started putting pressure on immediately, there is no chance for any development work to take place and still make it into the mainline kernel before the merge window closes.<br>
<p>
it will probably take multiple kernel cycles before the warning is seen by any users who don't compile their own kernels, and then more time for the pressure from the users to build up, and then development time to fix the problem, and then time to merge the fixes upstream.<br>
<p>
I don't see this taking place in less than a year, and probably a lot longer before everything is fixed.<br>

In a similar vein: my impression from the article is that there's been a memory corruption bug on the ARM architecture for at least half a year, yet nobody has been actually bit by it. Is there anybody who's actually using this kernel on version 6 ARM hardware?<br>

This puzzles me too.  I guessed as marcH does, in the first answer to your question.  It sure sounds spooky, but if it's been running this way for some time (years?), it must be one of those things that the manufacturer might want to use themselves someday for something different, so they put out a vague "undefined" warning while knowing that it does work.<br>

One of the problems your going to face with ARM is that there is no one single implementation of the hardware, nor all the available hardware now is going to reflect all the hardware that is going to be.<br>
<p>
<p>
ARM 6 is essentially a specification for a processor and not a real processor. Using the memory in the way the kernel does is 'unspecified'. It could work on today's processors made by Ti, but it could completely backfire on tomorrow's processors made by Marvel. <br>
<p>
It's impossible to know and if it does start corrupting memory in the kernel then it's going to be 100% ok as far as the processor designers are concerned because they are still following the specification.<br>
<p>
It's similar to having the kernel rely on unspecified GCC features were once a user chooses a GCC version they are forced to use it for ever and cannot change it no matter how badly it works with Linux.<br>

that depsnds on exactly how detailed the specs are. I believe that the ARM specs are not behavior (i.e. must implement these commands these ways), but are instead a much lower level (arrange logic gates in this way)<br>

That in turn depends on the licence: most of their customers (sorry, partners) licence an implementation. They get given either synthesizable code or a hard macro that implements the core (+MMU +cache as appropriate) to drop into their chip. Modulo bugs, all chips of this sort with the same core IP should behave the same. A few large partners (Marvell, Ti?) have architecture licences that cover changing the implementation provided it still matches the spec. . In those cases all bets are off for behaviour that the spec. doesn't define.<br>

If it triggers user visible issues only rarely, in seemingly random circumstances (like some of the memory corruption bugs do) i.e. it's not reproducible, it's very well possible that nobody's identified what's causing "all those crashes", or that they're related.<br>

Finally rejecting memory corruption is an API change? I can imagine such a logic backfiring and making his author not look serious.<br>

      <P><TT>gets()</TT> is still in the C language, despite it being next to impossible to use safely.  But if you link against it, some platforms give you a big scary warning. If you're standards-conforming, you have to have it though.  Removing it is an API/ABI change.</P>
<P>In some ways, the situation with ARM's memory remapping sounds similar:  a dangerous practice that seems to work suitably, despite the potential for it to go pear shaped when you least expect.</P>

I just think that the kernel can change the page's attribute at runtime.<br>
flush dcaches, mmu entries.. then give that clean page to device drivers.<br>
And rollback when device drivers give it back afterward.<br>
Can it be possible?<br>

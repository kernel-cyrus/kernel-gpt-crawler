<p>
A recent LWN <a href="/Articles/328695/#Comments">comment
thread</a>&mdash;which unfortunately descended into flames and
rudeness&mdash;had a <a href="/Articles/330488/">post</a> with some
interesting pointers to recent security research on Linux address space
layout randomization (ASLR).  Both look to be plausible attacks against
ASLR, and have not yet been addressed by the kernel hackers.  Perhaps worse
than that, though, is that these kinds of problems are evidently not being
reported to linux-kernel (or other kernel security channels), or not being
acted on.  Over the years, the 
interaction of security researchers and kernel hackers has often been
contentious, to the point where some security researchers may not be
reporting the Linux flaws they find via the usual channels.
</p>

<p>
ASLR is a technique used to thwart buffer overflow vulnerabilities in user
applications by randomizing the location of various pieces of the
application's address space.  Libraries, the heap and stack, as well as the
executable code for a process are placed at random addresses so that attacker
programs have a much more difficult time exploiting a buffer overflow.
Without the use of ASLR, an attack could use hardcoded addresses of
known locations in a process's address space (e.g. specific library
functions) to perform its nefarious deeds.
</p>

<p>
It is important that attacker programs be unable to see&mdash;or figure
out&mdash;the memory layout for other processes in the system.  Attackers
who can gain that information could then use any buffer overflows they know
of for that program with all of the addresses they need.  For that reason,
<tt>/proc/pid/maps</tt> (a file that describes the address space for
process id <tt>pid</tt>) only contains data when read by the owner of that
<tt>pid</tt>&mdash;or someone who can <tt>ptrace()</tt> it.   A recent <a
href="/Articles/330877/">advisory</a> about 
memcache and memcacheDB divulging that information, unauthenticated over
the network should be worrisome for just this reason.
</p>

<p>
The decision to stop allowing anyone to read the <tt>maps</tt> file came
about in 
2.6.22, long after ASLR was added in 2.6.12.  Based on a <a
href="http://www.cr0.org/paper/to-jt-linux-alsr-leak.pdf">presentation
[PDF]</a> at this year's CanSecWest conference, there is still enough
information being leaked from <tt>/proc</tt> files to be able to determine
the address space layout for a program. 
</p>

<p>
The <tt>/proc/pid/stat</tt> file reports the value of the instruction and
stack pointers of the process, and the <tt>/proc/pid/wchan</tt> file
reports its "wait channel", which is the function in which the process is
currently blocked.  Using that information, possibly sampled multiple
times, along with a map of the instruction boundaries of the executable,
Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy were <a
href="http://blog.cr0.org/2009/04/local-bypass-of-linux-aslr-through-proc.html">able
to bypass ASLR</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The second flaw in ASLR was <a
href="http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-europe-09/bh-eu-09-speakers.html#Fritsch">presented
at Black Hat Europe</a> by Hagen Fritsch.  A <a
href="http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-09/Fritsch/Blackhat-Europe-2009-Fritsch-Bypassing-aslr-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper
[PDF]</a> describing the flaw is instructive.  Essentially, the random
number generator (RNG) used to create the addresses for ASLR is flawed, allowing
those values to be correctly calculated up to two minutes after a target
process has been run. 
</p>

<p>
There is clearly a disconnect between the comment in the
<tt>get_random_int()</tt> function (which uses the IP RNG
<tt>secure_ip_id()</tt>) and the implementation of re-keying the
RNG in <tt>drivers/char/random.c</tt>.  The former
claims that it gets re-keyed every second, but the <tt>REKEY_INTERVAL</tt>
in the random driver is five <i>minutes</i>.  If ASLR requires the RNG to
re-key every second, a different function should be used.  But, there is an
additional problem.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>secure_ip_id()</tt> function takes one argument which it mixes with
the key in order to generate the random number.  <tt>get_random_int()</tt>
passes the sum of the <tt>pid</tt> and the internal kernel counter
<tt>jiffies</tt> as that parameter.  For a period of five minutes, if the
attacker can arrange for the same sum to be passed in, they will get the
same value as the target process did.  That can happen in one of two ways:
either by calling <tt>execve()</tt> on the desired target within one jiffy
of when the attack
process started&mdash;a rather difficult thing to arrange for a number of
reasons&mdash;or by 
calling <tt>execve()</tt> when <tt>pid + jiffies</tt> is the same as it was
for the target process.
</p>

<p>
An attacker process can spawn children until it gets a desired
<tt>pid</tt>, then wait for <tt>jiffies</tt> to reach a value where the sum
is the same.  Even though the absolute value of <tt>jiffies</tt> is not
known outside of the kernel, various calculations on the difference in
<tt>jiffie</tt> values can be used to narrow down the search.  Once again,
the <tt>/proc/pid/stat</tt> file can come into play here, by providing a
start time for the target process with a granularity typically 2.5 times
that of <tt>jiffies</tt> (10ms vs. 4ms).
</p>

<p>
In addition, Fritsch notes that IP sequence numbers may be leaking
information that could be used to assist in this attack because it uses the
same RNG with the five minute re-key time.  He has not looked at whether
that is the case.
</p>

<p>
These two vulnerabilities are fairly substantial and should certainly be
fixed.  It would seem fairly straightforward to limit access to the
<tt>/proc</tt> files based on the same <tt>ptrace()</tt> test used for
<tt>maps</tt>.  The RNG flaw is more subtle and probably requires a fair
amount of thought, but it is clear that the randomness provided is
insufficient, at least for ASLR.
</p>

<p>
Another <a
href="http://kernelbof.blogspot.com/2009/04/kernel-memory-corruptions-are-not-just.html">report</a>
that came out of the comment thread demonstrates a
misclassification of security flaws that tends to be very annoying to
the security community.  Misclassifying remotely exploitable flaws as a
"denial of service" (due to a kernel crash) is a fairly common thing for
distributions and others (knowingly or not) to do.  As the blog posting
indicates, it irritates some researchers:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'm wondering why kernel developers (or vendors?) continue to claim that
kernel memory corruption are just Denial of Service. Most of the times they
_are_ exploitable.. yes, even when the vulnerability is remotely triggered,
yes.. even when the corruption takes place in a freaking slub in the middle
of a kernel _heap_ .. yes even when you have kernel data pages marked NX
and the kernel .text read-only and yes, absolutely yes even when you start
only with a 16bit displacement...
</div>
</p>

<p>
That particular vulnerability is long fixed in the kernel, but
the whole posting is worth a read for those interested in how a kernel buffer
overflow can become a remote root exploit (even bypassing SELinux). It
is also indicative of the frustration that some in the security community
feel about Linux security.  For good or ill, Linux security is not well
regarded in that community, to the point where it appears that some,
possibly large, amount of Linux kernel security research is not being
communicated to the kernel community.  Perhaps that communication is
occurring but is just "flying under the
radar"&mdash;something that frequently happens with security
discussions&mdash;as it would be a tragedy to think that known
vulnerabilities are just falling through the cracks.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Oh, stop being so melodramatic.  It's not a tragedy.  It's money being made by those who look and listen carefully, widely, and with patience.  It was ever thus.  The important questions are the quantifiers: "<i>How much</i> money, <i>how often</i>, <i>by whom</i>, ...?"

Oh that first one is quite nasty. We can stop reporting wchan for non-self users when non-root without breaking too much, but doing the same for /proc/*/stat is out of the question. Perhaps we can blank out just the sensitive fields in such cases?<br>

The problem with blacklisting is that you never know when your blacklist is enough. The question is if there are any true legitimate uses of this and what's specifically required.<br>
<p>
Either way, there are plenty of other methods to get around the difficulties presented by ASLR as of its current implementation in mainline kernel.<br>

I would like to know if Jake's patch goes through, hopefully it does.<br>

Hi Jake,<br>
<p>
I noticed you submitted the following patch to LKML earlier this week:<br>
<a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/4/30/265?h1=4d3afeb44daf01af97a0b9c725dcaf1453b7886c&amp;h2=c1efa214c08fa9819a71f7e09815c7910f9a879b">http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/4/30/265?h1=4d3afeb44daf01af97a...</a><br>
<p>
but it hasn't received any responses yet, and I haven't seen any patches submitted by anyone else.  Are you aware of any progress in getting the vulnerability fixed?<br>

</div>
<p> A shrinker is an internal callback routine that the kernel can invoke
when memory is tight; a shrinker's job is to reduce the amount of memory
used by a specific kernel data structure.  During the 2012 Kernel Summit <a
href="/Articles/516439/">memcg/mm minisummit</a>, Ying Han talked about <a
href="/Articles/516431/">her patch</a> to implement a per-croup slab
shrinker.  In the current mainline kernel, reclaiming of kernel memory is not targeted. Ying noted that, to some
extent, this did not matter before, but with <a href="/Articles/516529/">Glauber Costa's kernel-memory
accounting work</a>, it becomes
necessary, in order that memory can be easily reclaimed from a specific
cgroup without impacting other cgroups.  Most of the introduction talked
about the specific technical details of how Ying's patch was implemented.

<p> Ying's series of patches collides somewhat with some (planned) <a href="/Articles/456071/">work</a> by Dave Chinner to make shrinkers NUMA-node aware.  It remains to be resolved whether Dave's
approach should be implemented first.  Ying would prefer that just the
dentry cache be handled first.  (The dentry cache is used to speed the
translation of a file pathname to the inode of the file. A consequence of
this is that a dentry cache entry "pins" the corresponding inode entry in
memory, preventing the inode being freed. This in turn can indirectly keep
all the page cache data for that inode&mdash;and the inode
itself&mdash;resident.)  Freeing an entry in the dentry cache can in turn
free a large amount of memory.  Therefore, in Ying's opinion, the dentry
cache is the most important problem.  Glauber pointed out to Ying that
freeing the dentry will make only the inode freeable, but will not
necessarily trigger the release of the inode memory. To make that happen
will require at least an inode shrinker as well.  Unfortunately, Dave
Chinner's work is not finished yet, and as it has been planned for a long
time, there appears to be a risk that it will never happen or will happen
too late to be useful.  (Dave was not present at the Kernel Summit to take
part in the discussions.)

<p> During the discussion, the question was raised as to whether Glauber's
patches should be merged at all before a per-cgroup slab shrinker is added
to the kernel. The concern was that, when a cgroup hits the soft limit,
there may be circumstances where memory can't be reclaimed without a
per-cgroup slab shrinker.  Glauber's response was that, even without the
shrinker, his patches can already greatly help some use cases. He
considered that development of the code in this area should take an
evolutionary approach, providing functionality with limitations now, and
improving it later for other use cases. Participants in the room seemed to
agree that merging a per-cgroup slab shrinker before Glauber's work
probably isn't necessary.

<p> Andrew Morton felt that it was likely that a more fundamental rework of
the memory-management code (i.e., a much bigger reworking even than the
piece of work planned by Dave Chinner), should be taken, since,
historically, changes to dentry cache management that make any modification
to dentry list management have been problematic.  Others in the room also
seemed to lean to the same view as Andrew, but no final decision was made
(changes on a grand scale naturally make memory-management developers
nervous about possible bugs and performance regressions, and so they are
cautious). Thus, the discussion will have to continue via mail.

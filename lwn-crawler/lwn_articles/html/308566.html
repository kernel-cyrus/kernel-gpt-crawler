[<i>Editor's note: the following article may look like a message to a
specific kernel developer, but it is really about the development process
in general.  Over the years, your editor has seen too many worthy hackers
run into development process problems; the end result is often that we lose
that person's contributions.  We are not so rich that we can afford that
sort of loss.  The desire to prevent such problems was the motivation
behind your editor's recently-written <a
href="http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/book/how-participate-linux-community">development
process document</a> - and this letter.</i>]
<p>


Dear Evgeniy,
<p>
Your editor has chosen to write to you in a public manner because he hates
to see talented developers get frustrated with the kernel process and storm
off.  We do not have an excess of capable hackers, especially those who can
work at your level.  Losing one hurts.  Your editor hopes that this
eventuality can be avoided in this case - for you, and for others who may
be encountering the same sort of frustrations you are.  Getting code into
the kernel can be a pain, sometimes.  That said, some 1160
developers have managed it since the opening of the 2.6.28 merge window in
October.  It is possible to get code merged with sufficient care.
<p>
You first posted your distributed storage (DST) patch back in 2007; LWN <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/246272/">took a look at it</a> at that time.
Since then, this code has come a long way.  Beyond the basic task of
exporting (and accessing) storage volumes across the net, this code claims
"bullet-proof memory allocations," zero-copy transport, failover recovery
with full transaction support, support for IPv6 and beyond, and a number of
features including encrypted data channels.  And, it is said, this code is
fast.  In general, it looks like good stuff.
<p>
You have posted the DST code on the mailing lists a number of times - too many,
apparently, for your tastes.  Frustration with the process appears to have
led to the behavior described in <a
href="http://www.ioremap.net/node/72">your recent weblog post</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
To understand the roots of this issue, I made a simple experiment with the
previous DST release. I added following lines into the patch to catch
reviewer's eyes: 
<p>
<pre>
    ass licker
    static char dst_name[] = "Successful erackliss screwing into";
</pre>
<p>
As you may expect, this does not compile and thus was never read by the
people who are subscribed to the appropriate mail lists. I got one private
mail about this fact for the whole week. The same DST code (without above
lines) was sent public first time more than month ago and was resent 3
times after that. 
<p>
That's why I do not care about DST inclusion anymore. I do not care about
its linux-kernel@ feedback.
</div>
<p>
So, because the fourth posting of identical code in one month received
little attention, 
DST now risks joining Kevents, network channels, network tree memory
management, asynchronous crypto, and more in that place where dusty,
out-of-tree 
stuff lives.  This would not be a good outcome.  So let us look at what can
be done to avoid that - for your sake, for DST users' sake, and for the
sake of other developers who may follow.
<p>
One way to get more reviews for your code is to pay attention to what those
reviewers are saying.  Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/308570/">spent some
time</a> on DST back in October.  He had a number of concrete requests -
such as documenting the user-space ABI and the network protocol - which
have not been satisfied.  He also asked for better code documentation in
general:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So please.  Go through all the code and make it tell a story.  Ask
	yourself "how would I explain all this to a kernel developer who is
	sitting next to me".  It's important, and it's an important skill.
</div>
<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308538/">November 25, 2008 version</a>
of DST still does not tell that story, and that makes it very hard for
other developers to understand.  Code review, as you know, is in critically
short supply in most free software projects.  Getting reviews for
difficult-to-understand code is hard, especially when it is a large body of
complex code which occupies a niche in which relatively few developers have
expertise.  So it's not surprising that your most recent comment involved
white space - anybody can make that kind of review without any need to
actually understand what's going on.
<p>
Not only does your patch not tell a story, but the individual pieces of it
do not even contain changelogs.  For a patch set marked "consider for
inclusion," that is a fatal error.  Playing along with the system on things
like that can seem like a waste of time, especially if you hold out no real
hope of the patch being merged, but it is a necessary sign of respect for
the people you are asking to consider the patch.  No maintainer will accept
a patch without a changelog.
<p>
While we're on the topic of documentation, your kernel configuration help
text reads, in its entirety:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This driver allows to create a distributed storage block device.
</div>
<p>
You owe your users a little bit more than that.  Why might they want to use
DST?  Where can they get the associated tools?  This, too, is a fatal error
for any substantive kernel change.
<p>
And, while we're still somewhat on the subject of reviews: Andrew naturally
called out the generic-looking thread pool implementation buried deep
within DST; shouldn't it pulled out and made more generic?  Your <a
href="/Articles/308575/">response</a> can be paraphrased as "I can't be
bothered to get the API past the review process, which, in any case, is
biased toward those who are 'closer to the high end'."  But pulling out
this code and 
merging it separately might be the ideal starting point for getting the
larger patch set into the kernel.  A generic thread pool hiding within a
storage device driver, instead, will be an ongoing impediment to
inclusion.
<p>
Then there is the issue of motivation: why should the kernel developers
want to merge this patch?  Who are the users of it - do you have users now?
How does it compare to other distributed storage technologies already in
the kernel?  What's the performance like - can you post some benchmark
results?  As it stands, DST looks like a nice piece of technology, but its
benefits are still unclear.  Tell that story, and the level of interest may
well go up.
<p>
Finally, your editor would like to counsel patience.  Some patches just
take longer than others to find their way in the kernel.  That is
especially true of complex patches which touch on issues like memory
management and which add new user-space ABIs.  As a close-to-home example,
look at David Howells's FS-Cache 
code, recently <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308113/">reposted</a> for
consideration.  The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/100321/">first LWN
article</a> on this code was published more than four years ago.  David is
probably getting a little tired of maintaining this code out-of-tree, but
he sticks with it, responds to reviews, and appears to be getting closer to
inclusion.
<p>
Evgeniy, you appear to be a brilliant and productive hacker.  You charge
into places that scare off most kernel developers, and you always come back
out with something interesting.  We <i>need</i> developers like you.  But
we need developers like you who can work with the process - no matter how
frustrating it gets.  The kernel process is certainly far from perfect, but
it is built around a set of principles which have served us well for many
years.  You could easily rise up through that process to become one of the
"high end" developers who, you say, have an easier time getting code
merged.  Or you could take your marbles and storm home, making snide
comments about reviewers on the way.  But that would not be good
for anybody involved.

      <p>The most important point to take from Evgeniy's response is a contradiction of something the article seems to imply: that Evgeniy got fed up with the kernel development process, performed an experiment to prove the LKML community isn't good enough for him, and decided to quit.
<p>
In fact, it appears that Evegeniy wasn't trying to get his code into the standard kernel and isn't mad at anybody.  He was trying to get review of his code, did an experiment that showed he wasn't succeeding in getting it, so stopped trying to get it that way.

      Many may not know that the GPL requires something like a change log if you modify and distribute a GPL program.  From the GPL (v2):
<blockquote>
"You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change."
</blockquote>
<p>
The simplest way to meet this requirement is with a standard changelog entry.
But even if this often-ignored requirement weren't there, it's good practice to document just what changed.

Sure you need to stick in some changelog entries if you're modifying the others' code, but I thought it was a requirement to maintain your own changelogs for every file, including the ones the patch just adds (since DST is mostly a chunk of brand new code, right?) If the original statement was merely about the fact that you need to acknowledge changing the work of others with a brief description of what you've changed there, then that's surely understandable and is of course required.<br>

So... if that requirement is not met, all rights to use and distribute the GPL'd work are automatically revoked under GPLv2, and can be revoked at the option of the copyright holder under GPLv3?  And just slapping a changelog on after the fact does not restore the rights?  <br>

Simple, if you've already reviewed the code and you get a new version, you do not want to start again from scratch: you want to know at a glance if you're earlier issues were fixed and what to review in the latest revision.<br>

One of the things that encourages people to write code but not worry<br>
about documentation is statements like:<br>
<p>
   Talk is cheap - show me the code<br>
<p>
As a pithy slogan it may be good, but it _could_ give the impression<br>
that writing code alone is enough. This is especially tempting<br>
when writing code comes easier to you than writing documentation.<br>
On top of this uber-hackers tend to dismiss code cleanup,<br>
documentation etc., as low-hanging fruit.<br>
<p>
The point that Harold Welte made in his FOSS.in talk this year is<br>
worth recalling here. (It seems to be to also be an undercurrent in<br>
the article being commented on.)<br>
<p>
   The best FOSS code is written to be read by other humans<br>
   <br>
Of course it _should_ also run efficiently on a real computer<br>
and so on, but FOSS code that is not a good read is not reviewable<br>
or maintainable.<br>
<p>
To make this easier for those for whom English is not a comfortable<br>
language, we should ask the following question:<br>
<p>
   Will reviewers be willing to accept documentation in languages other<br>
   than English?<br>

The question isn't whether reviewers are willing to accept non-Enlish documentation, the question is if people review stuff they don't know what it is nor what it can be used for. You need to spark some interest before you get some attention.<br>
<p>
Next step is to make it as easy as possible for people to try the stuff out. High quality documentation that explains briefly how it works and how to get it working is crucial here. the shorter the better, as it in general means it's easier to setup.<br>
<p>
In the case of distributes storage it should be made clear what problem is solved and what the advantages are compared to similar solutions, like distributed filesystems.<br>
<p>
At this point you'll get people interested enough to help you with the code, either writing parts of it or reviewing it. Or at least a bunch of users.<br>

<p>
Correct code (including comments) is written to be read by others, because at some point someone will want to add a feature or fix a bug or make it more efficient.<br>
<p>
Also because, in two months/weeks/years time (depends on people), the writer will have gone to some other activities and won't be able to understand that ugly clever trick they made to fix that strange case they don't quite remember all the details of.<br>
<p>
Also because compilers will have trouble reading too it if it's badly written, and may optimize it in unexpected ways...<br>

Probably, but what would be the point? The code won't be accepted in that state on mainline anyway...  so you're more than likely to just get a "translate to english first, please", or to be completely ignored.<br>

Not that I like the "completely ignored" thing, but...<br>

I've worked extensively with Evgeniy Polyakov (on an unrelated module -- the w1 system), and found him responsive, accommodating, and very eager to work with developers.<br>
<p>
Documentation -- pretty sparse. But he will certainly answer and explain. In the corporate world, you'd assign a documentation specialist to work with him and have a very successful combination. Perhaps we need a role in kernel development for documenters.<br>

      Well, the problem is quite simple: there aren't many people who enjoy doing that.  In the proprietary development world, you have to pay people to do that.  Same with testing, reviewing, planning, and release control.
<p>
So the challenge isn't to get people to do the non-coding work; it's to find a way to use the fun coding work that is in great supply without also having the non-coding work.

All of this makes spindles, and there are practical limits (including reliability and commodity ones) to how much hard drives can be reasonably stuffed into a box.<br>

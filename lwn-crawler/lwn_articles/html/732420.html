           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 30, 2017</br>
           </div>
<p>
A nearly year-old "fix" to the main logging function used in the kernel,
<tt>printk()</tt>, changed the appearance of some log messages in an
unexpected way, at least for some.
Messages that had appeared on a single line will now be spread over multiple
lines as each call to <tt>printk()</tt> begins a new line in the output
unless the <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> flag is used.
That is how a comment in the kernel code says it should work, but the
change was made by Linus Torvalds without any discussion or
fanfare, so it 
took some by surprise.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>printk()</tt> function is the workhorse of kernel output, for
critical messages, warnings, information, and debugging.  It is <a href="http://elinux.org/Debugging_by_printing">used</a> in
much the same way as <a 
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html"><tt>printf()</tt></a>
but there are some differences.  For one thing, "log levels" can be
prepended to the format string to specify the severity of the message.
These range from <tt>KERN_EMERG</tt> to <tt>KERN_DEBUG</tt> and can be used
as follows:
<pre>
    printk(KERN_ALERT "CPU on fire: %d\n", cpu_num);
</pre>
The log levels are simply strings that get concatenated with the format string,
thus there is no comma between them.  Another difference from
<tt>printf()</tt> is in how a format
string without a newline is treated, which is what has changed.  The
<tt>KERN_CONT</tt> "log level" is meant to indicate a continuation line; a
<tt>printk()</tt> that lacks that flag is supposed to start a new line in
the log—though that hasn't always been enforced.
</p>

<p>
Pavel Machek <a href="/Articles/732423/">posted</a> a query about that
behavior on August&nbsp;28.  He noted that "<q>printk("foo"); printk("bar"); seems to produce
foo\nbar</q>", which was both surprising and unwelcome.  That led to a
bit of a <a href="/Articles/732424/">rant</a> from Torvalds, who had made
the change:
<div class="BigQuote">
If you want to continue a line, you NEED to use KERN_CONT.
<p>
That has always been true. It hasn't always been enforced, though.
<p>
If you do two printk's and the second one doesn't say "I'm a
continuation", the printk logic assumes you're just confused and
wanted two lines.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But, as several pointed out, that behavior only
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4bcc595ccd80decb4245096e3d1258989c50ed41">changed</a>
relatively recently (for the 4.9 kernel released in December 2016); prior to that Machek's example would produce 
"foobar" as he expected.  Lots of places in the kernel use
<tt>printk()</tt> without <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> and expect to get output on a
single line, Joe Perches <a href="/Articles/732433/">pointed out</a>.
Perches also complained that Torvalds had, in fact, changed longstanding
behavior and was not just enforcing something that had "<q>always been
true</q>". But Torvalds <a href="/Articles/732434/">pointed to</a> a <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4749252776712e587c7c7619cbf0342b080c7f44">commit
from 2007</a> that added the <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> flag, along with the
following comment:
<div class="BigQuote">
<pre>
    /*
     * Annotation for a "continued" line of log printout (only done after a
     * line that had no enclosing \n). Only to be used by core/arch code
     * during early bootup (a continued line is not SMP-safe otherwise).
     */
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
While 2007 is not exactly "always", the comment certainly documents the
intent of <tt>KERN_CONT</tt>, so not using it and expecting multiple calls
to <tt>printk()</tt> to end up on the same line has not been right for
nearly ten years.  Torvalds was unapologetic about this recent change:
<div class="BigQuote">
So yes, we're enforcing it now, and we're not going back to the
unenforced times, because a decade of shit has shown that people
didn't do it without being forced to.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In fact, he would like to <a href="/Articles/732435/">get rid</a> of the
whole idea of continuation lines.  They made some amount of sense when the
output was just sent to a circular character buffer, he said, but
<tt>printk()</tt> 
now has a log-based structure so continuation lines do not really work well
in that environment.  Beyond that, there is always the chance that some
asynchronous action (e.g. an interrupt) outputs something that interferes
with the single line of output.  Instead, users should be marshaling their
own output into single-line chunks and passing those to <tt>printk()</tt>,
he said.
</p>

<p>
He went on to <a href="/Articles/732436/">suggest</a> that some helper
functions be added to assist in places where that marshaling is needed.
Users would provide their own buffer to these routines that would then call
<tt>printk()</tt> when they have a full line.
<div class="BigQuote">
That avoids the whole nasty issue with printk - printk wants to show
stuff early (because _maybe_ it's critical) and printk wants to make
log records with timestamps and loglevels. And printk has serious
locking issues that are really nasty and fundamental.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That set off a discussion on various ways to implement what had been
suggested.  Various schemes to replace <tt>printk()</tt> with something
"smarter" were batted down quickly by Torvalds.  Steven Rostedt <a
href="/Articles/732438/">recommended</a> using the kernel's <tt>seq_buf</tt>
facility that is used for tracing and implementing <tt>/proc</tt> files.
That idea 
seemed to gain traction among the other thread participants (including,
crucially, Torvalds).  So far, no patch set along those lines has been
proposed, but it seems like a promising direction.
</p>

<p>
No matter what happens, there are going to be multiple changes to fix the
output in places where <tt>KERN_CONT</tt> was not used but should have
been.  If the <tt>seq_buf</tt> interface is going to be used, it would make
sense to do that directly, rather than add a bunch of <tt>KERN_CONT</tt>
flags in various places.  Once that is done, perhaps the existing uses of
<tt>KERN_CONT</tt> could be tackled to get rid of as many of those as
possible—leaving only those used at boot time as was originally planned.
</p>

<p>
Clearly Torvalds doesn't think twice about breaking things internal to the
kernel in order to enforce something he sees as important.  Doing so
silently, though, as happened here, might not have been the best approach.
Had 
there been discussion of the patch on the mailing list, it would at least
have given folks a chance to realize what was up.  That might have
eliminated Machek's query and perhaps reduced Torvalds's blood pressure a
bit.

      <p>He's defending it <em>now</em>, but I remember when the new /dev/kmsg system got merged and broke implicit (non-KERN_CONT) continuations for the first time. Linus wasn't amused.</p>

      <p>It's not journalistic style, it's how we actually speak: you fully define the persons the first time you mention them, then you refer to them with a placeholder. "<i>I met my younger brother at the pub. <b>He</b> was drinking a beer</i>".
<p>LWN's style is the same: full name and surname (and possibly role in the kernel community) at first mention, unadorned surname afterwards.

Alternatively, just using first names (the way people in non-insanely-formal workplaces actually do) would mean we wouldn't have to dash around in this ridiculous mapping chaos at all. I use first names and sometimes initials or self-chosen identifier handles to identify people ('rms', not 'Stallman'; 'Linus', not 'Torvalds'; 'mkp', not 'Petersen') simply because those are the identifiers by which they identify themselves to other people.<br>
<p>
If these people were in the habit of introducing themselves to other people by their surname, using surnames as identifiers in news reporting might make sense. (For, e.g. political reporting, this is often true). But until Linus is is the habit of calling himself 'Torvalds' on the linux-kernel list, and other people call him that, I think it's the wrong identifier to use, and needlessly confusing. It seems rather disrespectful, too. Why call someone 'Machek' when he's made it clear in every post he makes that he wants to be called Pavel?<br>
<p>
(This may be a generation-gap thing, too. A lifetime ago, perhaps before WWII and definitely before WWI, it was disrespectful to not call your elders and betters by their surnames whether or not they called each other by anything else, but in my view this has completely inverted by now.)<br>

      I think you can't apply the same rules to the inner group of co-workers who have daily interactions and the broader audience of a newsletter.
 I've never thought of LWN as targeting the same people who is involved in the kernel development and is thus familiar with its jargon, nicknames, and abbreviations. In that restricted group it might be OK to use first names, as it's also OK to use well-known acronyms like BKL. For the rest of us, LWN provides a great service defining them on first use and applying a consistent scheme.

I think it's mostly because Jon *is* in that restricted group (which is probably why he uses the style I'm familiar with).<br>
<p>
(Also, you don't have to be *in* the inner group. That's the beauty of work in the open: you just have to read the same mailing lists!)<br>

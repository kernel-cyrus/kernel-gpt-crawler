<p>
Andrii Nakryiko led a session at
the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> giving
a look into the APIs for capturing stack traces
using BPF, and how the APIs could be made more useful. BPF programs can capture the
current stack trace of a running process, including the portion in the kernel
during execution of a system call, which can be useful for diagnosing
performance problems, among other things. But there are substantial problems with
the existing API.
</p>

<p>
The existing way to get stack traces in BPF is to create a BPF map for containing
the elements of the trace, and then to call
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">
<tt>bpf_get_stackid()</tt></a> from the BPF side, which returns a
unique ID for the map, Nakryiko
explained. Then in user space, the program could do a normal map lookup to
retrieve the stack trace. The kernel also captures and stores some related
information, such as the ELF build ID and the file offset, which helps identify
what program the stack trace corresponds to for offline analysis. This API
sounds fairly simple, but unfortunately it has a few quirks, he said.
</p>

<p>
It can capture either a user-space stack trace or a kernel stack trace, but not
both. The kernel supports capturing both, the BPF API just doesn't have a way to
indicate that you want both, Nakryiko said. There is also no way to know how
large the stack that was captured actually is; programmers just need to hope
their stack-unwinding code stops at the correct point. These are both flaws,
but they can't be too much of a problem, because nobody has complained.
</p>

<p>
The
final quirk is that the kernel performs automatic stack deduplication. If the
captured stack trace matches an existing one, the kernel returns the existing ID.
This behavior sounds great in theory, since deduplication can save space, but
the map used to store stack traces does not have any way to deal with hash
collisions. Stack traces are hashed and placed into the corresponding slot in
the map, but each slot can only hold one stack trace.
Accordingly, hash collisions (where the hashes are the same, but the traces are
not) are both frequent and unavoidable when
capturing many stack traces. The API does let the programmer specify whether
they wish to retain the old or new stack trace on collision, but that just
leaves them with two bad options: lose data or corrupt data. The hash-based
stack deduplication also makes clearing out entries from the map
inherently racy.
</p>

<p>
Nakryiko's proposed new API fixes these problems by letting the BPF program
handle memory management: it provides a buffer, into which the kernel captures
the stack trace, and then the BPF program is free to share that with user space
in whatever way makes most sense for the application. All but one use case at
Meta has switched to the new API, he noted. There are still some potential
improvements to be made, however. Right now, stacks are captured synchronously.
This is a problem, because the API can be called from anywhere, including a
context where page faults are not permitted.
</p>

<p>
If part of the program being inspected is paged out, that means the information
stored on those pages could be left out of the capture. This only affects
user-space stack traces, since the kernel always remains paged in. This is a
particular problem for programs that use DWARF-based stack unwinding, since the
DWARF debugging information is unlikely to be paged in when the capture is taken.
</p>

<p>
Nakryiko would like the new API to be asynchronous, so that it can wait for
necessary information (for user-space captures) to be paged in. That doesn't
work for <em>kernel</em> stack traces, however, because the kernel can't be
paused to wait the way that user space can be. On the other hand, capturing a
user-space stack trace can be postponed without changing the information
returned by waiting until just before the kernel returns to user space, since
the process is frozen until then. "Return to user space" is a nice context, he
said, since the kernel can wait for memory to be paged in, etc.
</p>

<p>
All of these separate constraints come together in the proposed API design.
Nakryiko proposes having a function that returns a unique ID for a stack trace.
The ID acts like a reservation — it is stable, and can be recorded, passed to
user space, etc. Once the ID is received, a stack trace is captured into the
reserved buffer. Kernel traces are captured synchronously, but user-space traces
are captured on return to user space. Looking the stack capture up in the
corresponding map returns <tt>EAGAIN</tt> until the capture is ready. The kernel
doesn't perform deduplication, making deleting elements work in a sensible way.
One audience member asked whether this meant that there could be identical stack
traces with different IDs, and Nakryiko confirmed that this was the case.
Daniel Borkmann noted that if the operations were asynchronous, it would also be
possible to grow the map itself, which is not true of the existing API.
</p>

<p>
Nakryiko did say that one part of the API was not yet thought out: how to let the user know
when a stack trace is ready. The trivial solution, he said, was to not send a
notification and force the users to poll. Slightly more complicated would be a
map-wide epoll notification whenever any trace is ready. Alternatively, each
slot in the map could have separate epoll notifications — but that would be a
wasteful use of file descriptors. Finally, the most efficient approach would be
to set up a BPF ring buffer into which IDs are put as they become ready,
permitting efficient notification and consumption.
</p>

<p>
One audience member pointed out that Nakryiko had pretty much just described the
mechanism behind io_uring, and suggested that might be an appropriate mechanism.
Nakryiko wasn't too sure about whether io_uring would be suitable, but
acknowledged the possibility. Another audience member asked whether they could
put a growable ring buffer in a
<a href="/Articles/961941/">BPF arena</a>. Nakryiko thought that would not be
helpful, since there are already many ring buffers in the BPF subsystem, and
reimplementing one in an arena wouldn't really help. He did note that if they
switched to putting the whole stack trace into a ring buffer, they could
potentially fit drop notifications in the ring buffer as well.
</p>

<p>
Yu pointed out that the API could use a callback instead of a notification: run
another BPF program on completion, and let the user decide how to notify user
space. This prompted an extended discussion about different mechanisms, and how
they traded off between flexibility and simplicity. Nakryiko did say that he was
against a mechanism that tried to move too much functionality out of the kernel,
since the kernel already has good built-in support for stack traces. One example
is how user-space return probes can corrupt the stack trace — the kernel has all
the necessary information to fix that up, whereas a more flexible mechanism
would leave it up to the user.
</p>

<p>
The discussion didn't reach a solid conclusion before the session time ended,
but there are already many
mechanisms in BPF and elsewhere in the kernel for notifying user space when an
operation completes, so it seems unlikely for that to remain a sticking point of
API design. BPF already has fairly good debugging support, given the tight
integration with the BPF Type Format (BTF)
and support for tracepoints in both the kernel and user
space; it looks like some of the work in progress could help
extend that support even more.

I am interested in this way for use case of bpf aio, but not dig into details yet,<br>
does current BPF support  this kind of calling one specified prog from kfunc?<br>

Yes, via the struct_ops mechanism, which we've <a href="/Articles/974848/">written about</a> a few times, mostly in the context of sched_ext.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 28, 2020</br>

One of the basic rules of kernel-module development is that modules can
only access symbols (functions and data structures) that have been
explicitly exported.  Even then, many symbols are restricted so that only
modules with a GPL-compatible license can access them.  It turns out,
though, that there is a readily available workaround that makes it easy for
a module to access any symbol it wants.  That workaround seems likely to be
removed soon despite some possible inconvenience for some out-of-tree
users; the reason why that is happening turns out to be relatively
interesting. 

<p>
The backdoor in question is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/kallsyms.c#L162"><tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt></a>,
which will return the address associated with any symbol in the kernel's
symbol table.  Modular code that wants to access a symbol ordinarily denied
to it can use <tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt> to get the address of
its target, then dereference it in the usual ways.  This function itself is
exported with the GPL-only restriction, which theoretically limits its use
to free software.  But if a proprietary module somewhere were to falsely
claim a free license to get at GPL-only symbols, it would not be the first
time.
<p>
Will Deacon has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200221114404.14641-1-will@kernel.org/">posted a
patch series</a> that removes the export for
<tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt> (and <tt>kallsyms_on_each_symbol()</tt>,
which is also open to abuse).  There were some immediate positive
responses; few developers are favorably inclined toward module authors
trying to get around the export system, after all.  There were, however, a
couple of concerns expressed.
<p>
One of those is that there is, it seems, a class of out-of-tree users of
<tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt> that is generally considered to be
legitimate: live-patching systems for the kernel.  Irritatingly, kernel
bugs often
stubbornly refuse to restrict themselves to exported functions, so a live
patch must be able to locate (and patch out) any function in the kernel;
<tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt> is a convenient way to do that.  After some
discussion Joe Lawrence <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/943e7093-2862-53c6-b7f4-96c7d65789b9@redhat.com/">let
it be known</a> that the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kpatch">kpatch</a> system has all of
its needed infrastructure 
in the mainline kernel, and so has no further need for
<tt>kallsyms_lookup_name()</tt>.  The <a
href="https://ksplice.oracle.com/">Ksplice</a> system, though, evidently 
still uses it.  As Miroslav Benes <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/alpine.LSU.2.21.2002251854550.1630@pobox.suse.cz/">observed</a>,
though: "<q>no one cares about ksplice in upstream now</q>".  So it
would appear that live patching will not be an obstacle to the merging of
this patch.
<p>
A different sort of concern was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200221232746.6eb84111a0d385bed71613ff@kernel.org/">raised</a>
by Masami Hiramatsu, who noted that there are a number of other ways to
find the address associated with a kernel symbol.  User space could place
some kprobes to extract that information, or a kernel module could, if time
and CPU use is not a concern, use <tt>snprintf()</tt> with the
"<tt>%pF</tt>" format (which prints the function associated with a given
address) to search for the address of interest.  He worried that the change
would make life harder for casual developers while not really getting in
the way of anybody who is determined to abuse the module mechanism.
<p>
In response, Deacon posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200221144853.GA18153@willie-the-truck/">an
interesting message</a> about what is driving this particular change.
Kernel developers are happy to make changes just to make life difficult for
developers they see as abusing the system, but that is not quite what is
happening here.  Instead, it is addressing a support issue at Google.
<p>
Back in 2018, LWN <a href="/Articles/771974/">reported on</a> work being
done to bring the Android kernel closer to the mainline.  One of the steps
in that direction is moving the kernel itself into the <a
href="https://source.android.com/setup/build/gsi">Android generic system
image</a> (GSI), an Android build that must boot and run on a device for that
device to be considered compliant with the Android requirements.  Putting
the kernel into the GSI means that hardware vendors can no longer modify
it; they will be limited to what they can do by adding kernel modules to
the GSI.
<p>
Restricting vendors to supplying kernel modules greatly limits the kind of
changes they can make; there will be no more Android devices that replace
the CPU scheduler with some vendor's special version, for example.  But
that only holds 
if modules are restricted to the exported-symbol interface; if they start
to reach into arbitrary parts of the kernel, all bets are off.  Deacon
doesn't say so, but it seems clear that some vendors are, at a minimum,
thinking about doing exactly that.  The business-friendly explanation for
removing this capability is: "<q>Monitoring and managing the ABI surface is not feasible
if it effectively includes all data and functions via
kallsyms_lookup_name()</q>".
<p>
After seeing this explanation, Hiramatsu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200222084438.37a0ff99edbe32acdb666c79@kernel.org/">agreed
that the patch makes sense</a> and offered a Reviewed-by tag.  So this
concern, too, seems unlikely to prevent this patch set from being merged.
<p>
It's worth repeating that discouraging module developers from bypassing the
export mechanism is generally seen as more than sufficient motivation to
merge a change like this.  But it is also interesting to see a large
company supporting that kind of change as well.  By more closely tying the
Android kernel to the mainline, Google would appear to be better aligning
its own interests with the long-term interests of the development community
— on this point, at least.  That, hopefully, will lead to better kernels on
our devices that also happen to be a lot closer to mainline kernels.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I see this as part of Google's upcoming effort to move vendors off Linux to their proprietary Fuchsia kernel.<br>
<p>
(A certain alternative pronunciation of its name perhaps telegraphs its purpose.)<br>

We may be heartened by the previously demonstrated inability of large organizations to create a viable new kernel from scratch--OS/360 excepted.<br>

Even though it is often rendered moot by the fact most people use distro kernels, making it (slightly) harder to find the addresses of non-exported symbols is probably (slightly) raising the cost of producing, and testing, exploits reliable across a range of kernel versions, configs and patches from vendors. This is unlikely to be a bad thing, especially with most kernels lacking powerful anti-exploitation features.<br>

I have worked with packaging chromium for Debian before, and I also know that every time the v8 developers at Google do a refactor they do a Fuscia on IBM&#x27;s work to port to POWER. If you are anti-social a &quot;Do What The Fuck You Want License&quot; is certainly not a promise not to fuck their users, especially when the users are NOT using an open source build.<br>

What is the current status of kpatch, really? I see there's all sorts of patches coming in for years now, but do we have all of the pieces of the puzzle? Can I install a reasonably mainstream distro (or even upstream kernels…?), run a command and get it live-patched up to date? (I remember being able to do that with ksplice before they got sold to Oracle, and it was pretty amazing.)<br>

I have not used it myself, but Oracle (for Oracle Linux, RHEL, Ubuntu, Fedora), RedHat, SUSE, Canonical (Ubuntu) and Gentoo all support it AFAICT. For the first four companies it is a paid service but Oracle has a gratis trial period. AFAICT the first four don't publish their tooling surrounding kpatch itself, but Gentoo does. I expect you could repurpose Gentoo's tooling to do patches for mainline kernels.<br>

There is also another one (KernelCare I think) that IIRC has its own non-mainline patching mechanism.<br>

I faced this problem and used the kprobe solution like this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/zizzu0/LinuxKernelModules/blob/main/FindKallsymsLookupName.c">https://github.com/zizzu0/LinuxKernelModules/blob/main/Fi...</a><br>

Well, this is nice, however it cost me two days of not sleeping when installing opencl with AMD Vega 10 card to the new Bullseye instalation of Debian.<br>
<p>
First I downloaded a fresh new package amdgpu-pro-21.10-1247438-ubuntu-20.04 from AMD. Well its not for Debian, but Debian is brand new so I was thinking I could run it there. Not really easy!<br>
<p>
First they decided to support ubuntu-20.04 with kernel 5.8 and Debian 11 is shipped with 5.10. When my attempts to build their amdgpu module failed multiple times, I decided to downgrade and compile 5.9x, 5.8x kernels on my own.<br>
<p>
I also would like to mention that 5.7x kernel was the last one, where  &quot;mmap_sem&quot; was not called &quot;mmap_lock&quot; in mm_types.h <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200422001422.232330-11-walken@google.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200422001422.232330-11...</a><br>
<p>
So I had to change inside amdgpu-dkms_5.9.20.104-1247438_all.deb find . -type f | xargs sed -i &quot;s/mmap_sem/mmap_lock/g&quot;<br>
<p>
And to be able to retain the distribution kernel I also needed to add BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL=&quot;^(5\.[0-9]\.)&quot; to usr/src/amdgpu-5.9.20.104-1247438/dkms.conf<br>
<p>
Well everything installed, module compiled, but it was not working. In my dmesg there was cryptic message<br>
kernel BUG at /var/lib/dkms/amdgpu/5.9.20.104-1247438/build/amd/amdkcl/kcl_common.c:44!<br>
<p>
Let&#x27;s have a look to that source <br>
void amdkcl_symbol_init(void)<br>
{<br>
#ifndef HAVE_KALLSYMS_LOOKUP_NAME<br>
    struct kprobe kp;<br>
    int r;<br>
<p>
    memset(&amp;kp, 0, sizeof(kp));<br>
    kp.symbol_name = &quot;kallsyms_lookup_name&quot;;<br>
    r = register_kprobe(&amp;kp);<br>
    if (!r) {<br>
        _kcl_kallsyms_lookup_name = (void *)kp.addr;<br>
        unregister_kprobe(&amp;kp);<br>
    } else {<br>
        pr_err(&quot;fail to get kallsyms_lookup_name, abort...\n&quot;);<br>
        BUG();<br>
    }<br>
#else<br>
    _kcl_kallsyms_lookup_name = kallsyms_lookup_name;<br>
#endif<br>
}<br>
<p>
This is a code from AMD! Exploiting another way to get to that function. Maybe you shall remove it altogether because the only thing you achieved that a big player who bundles his closed source firmware into the kernel use this exploit and I spent a 48 hours of my work figuring out that it does not work in my use case producing that BUG!<br>
<p>
So finally I am forced either to downgrade to &lt;3.7 kernel or to add EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(kallsyms_lookup_name); to kallsyms.c and hope that they parse well that macro to define HAVE_KALLSYMS_LOOKUP_NAME to have it running in 3.9 kernel. Because in 3.10 its broken also from another reason.<br>

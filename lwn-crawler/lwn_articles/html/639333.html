Once upon a time, the only way to run the Linux kernel was as the primary
operating system on a handy piece of hardware.  Since then, though, other
modes of operation have become possible: the kernel can, for example, be
run as the guest 
of another kernel through virtualization, or as a user-space process with
the <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">user-mode Linux
(UML)</a> port.  One mode that has not been supported is 
running the kernel as a library that can be called from within an
application program, but that situation appears to be about to change
thanks to a patch set which has just made its first appearance on the
linux-kernel list.
<p>
This patch set, posted by Hajime Tazaki, goes by the name <a
href="/Articles/637658/">LibOS</a>; it was presented (<a
href="http://www.slideshare.net/hajimetazaki/library-operating-system-for-linux-netdev01">slides
[slideshare]</a>)
at the recent <a href="https://netdev01.org/">Netdev&nbsp;0.1</a>
conference.  LibOS is structured as if it were a new 
architecture port; it can be found under <tt>arch/lib</tt> in the kernel
tree.  But this port, when built, does not result in a bootable kernel;
instead, it creates a shared library that can then be loaded into a running
process.
<p>
One might wonder why this mode of operation would be useful.  Though it is
not limited to this particular use, the main focus of LibOS at the moment is
to make the Linux network stack available to user-space applications.
User-space network stacks are not unheard of in the Linux world; they have
shown up in certain performance-sensitive settings for some years now.
With LibOS, it is not necessary to write (or port) a new network stack to
run in a Linux process; the kernel's network stack is now available to
use directly.
<p>
Needless to say, one does not just make the network stack callable from
user space without doing a bit of work.  To make this mode possible, the
LibOS developers have created a whole set of stub functions to replace
various kernel functions used by the networking code.  Indeed, the bulk of
the patch set consists of thousands of lines of stub functions.  They do
things like replacing the slab allocator with a simple version based on
<tt>malloc()</tt> and, for the most part, shorting out the filesystem layer
entirely.  When that is done, what's left is the networking stack with
almost enough scaffolding to let it run standalone within a process's
address space.
<p>
"Almost enough" because a few tasks are still left to the calling
application.  For example, there is no stub implementation of
<tt>schedule()</tt>; instead, the calling code must provide one during the
initialization process.  The idea here is that the running application may
want to exert some control over how the management of processes (most
likely implemented as POSIX threads) will be done.
<p>
There are currently two projects using the LibOS framework.  <a
href="https://github.com/libos-nuse/linux-libos-tools">Networking in user
space</a> (NUSE) finishes the job of providing a running user-space network
stack.  With NUSE, one can set up arbitrary networking topologies,
interface to other user-space mechanisms like <a
href="http://dpdk.org/">DPDK</a> for fast transmission and reception of
packets, and more.  The <a
href="https://www.nsnam.org/overview/what-is-ns-3/">NS-3 system</a>,
instead, is a simulation framework used to run tests on network protocols
and implementations.  It can run network-oriented applications on top of
the LibOS network stack using <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt> tricks to redirect calls
to the networking system calls.
<p>
There are a number of interesting things that can be done with these
tools.  Users running networking in user space for performance reasons
could consider using it, though the kernel's stack has not been optimized for
performance in that setting.  Somebody wanting to run an experimental
protocol like <a href="/Articles/544399/">MPTCP</a> in production could use
LibOS (built with a suitably patched kernel) to get that feature without
touching the network stack used by the rest of the system.  There are also
a lot of opportunities 
for running debugging tools with a network stack that is running in user
mode.
<p>
While the LibOS work has been focused on the network stack as the first
objective, there is nothing in its design that limits it to networking.  If
one wanted to, say, isolate the virtual filesystem layer instead, it would
mostly be a matter of coming up with the additional stub functions needed.
<p>
A question that might come to mind is: how does this differ from the
user-mode Linux port that has been in the kernel for many years?  Indeed,
UML maintainer Richard Weinberger <a href="/Articles/639347/">wondered</a>
exactly that.  There appear to be a few differences.  UML is meant to run
as a standalone application in its own right, while LibOS runs as a library
called by some other application.  One can even have several LibOS
instances running simultaneously within the same application.  Beyond that,
the idea of isolating a single subsystem for use within an application is
not a part of the design of UML.  After looking more deeply at the LibOS
code, Richard <a href="/Articles/639348/">agreed</a> that it brought some
interesting things to the table.
<p>
One possible area of concern is the maintenance of all of the stub
functions.  There are a lot of them, and they will need to be updated
whenever the corresponding "real" version is changed in the kernel.  Few
maintainers are likely to think that they have to update LibOS when they
are making changes to their own subsystems.  As a result, it seems likely
that LibOS will be broken much of the time.
<p>
That, in turn, means that maintenance concerns may be one of the chief
obstacles LibOS must overcome before it can be considered for merging into
the mainline kernel.  If LibOS is often broken, developers will hesitate to
use it.  If LibOS breakage leads to complaints against subsystem
maintainers working on their own code, they may respond by calling for its
removal.  Avoiding these pitfalls may require finding some way to automate
the creation of these stub functions.  Creating a library-mode version of
the kernel may turn out to have been the easy part when one considers what
is required to make that work maintainable in the long run.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Dear editor, <br>
<p>
1) the ns-3 DCE component that can be used to instantiate multiple libos instances within a single process does not use LD_PRELOAD tricks. Instead, it relies on either the dlmopen function (implemented with an adhoc ELF Loader that is binary compatible with the glibc loader) or a piece of code that plays tricks with the ELF binaries.<br>
<p>
2) I have seen this statement a lot of times: "LibOS will be broken much of the time" and I have been unable to dispel that myth yet. In practice, my experience has been that it is not the case and it seems to boil down to the fact that the internal interfaces that are plugged in appear to be much more stable than feared by most kernel developers (I shared that fear at some point a couple of years ago). Or maybe I have a different appreciation for what "most of the time" means. In practice, it appears that a couple hours of work once 2 to 3 months is enough to maintain this code.<br>
<p>
Now, I would not want the above to be interpreted as a justification for not merging this code since I feel it would be a terrific addition to the kernel but I felt compelled to correct what I perceive as a misconception.<br>
<p>
[thanks again for this terrific resource that I have been subscribed to for ... gasp ... 8 years now !?]<br>

Indeed, there has been quite a lot of contact. The rump kernel has sorted out how to keep the rump kernel synced - it is used heavily in the test suite, for example, so it is clear when it is not working.<br>

I wonder if the result is sufficiently normal user space code that one could, for example run it (or the binary it's linked to) under Valgrind, or to compile it with some kind of instrumentation (for example, AddressSanitizer or some kind of branch instrumentation for profile guided fuzzing)?<br>

Does this means that internal Linux functions now become part if the user-visible API (via LibOS rather than via system call), and thus have to be stable?<br>

... and get screwed as soon as kernel internals change.  What, does anybody expect that we'll accept the stability obligations on anything other than syscalls?  If anyone tries to argue that *and* arch/libos maintainers don't tell the to piss off convincingly enough, well, git rm arch/libos will solve the entire problem just fine, TYVM...<br>

as mathieu_lacage mentioned, it's not that bad to maintain the kernel internal changes.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In practice, it appears that a couple hours of work once 2 to 3 months is enough to maintain this code.</font><br>

I guess this is only useful for applications that are GPL-2 compatible? NS-3 is GPL-2. NUSE, true to github form, has no license...<br>

<p>
As part of the <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/48/#20190909">Distribution
Kernels microconference</a> at Linux Plumbers Conference 2019, Matthias
Männich described how the Android project monitors changes to the internal
kernel ABI.  As Android kernels evolve, typically by adding features and
bug fixes from more recent kernel versions, the project wants to ensure
that the ABI remains the same so that out-of-tree modules will still
function.  While the talk was somewhat Android-specific, the techniques and
tools used could be applied to other distributions with similar needs
(e.g. enterprise distributions).
</p>

<p>
Männich is on the Google Android kernel team, but is relatively new to the kernel;
his background is in build systems and the like.  He stressed that he is
not talking about the user-space ABI of the kernel, but the ABI and API
that the kernel exposes to modules.  The idea is to have a stable ABI over
the life of an Android kernel.  He knows that other distributions have been
doing this "for ages", but the Android kernel and build system are
different  so it made sense to look at 
other approaches to this problem.
</p>

<h4>Out of tree</h4>

<p>
It is sometimes impossible to have everything in-tree, he said, which is
part of the motivation for this work.  Stabilizing the ABI will also
decouple the development of the kernel and modules for it.  The hope is to
reduce the fragmentation in the Android space by reducing the number of
different kernel versions out there while providing a single ABI/API for
the module ecosystem.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Starting as part of Android 8, <a href="/Articles/765467/">Project Treble</a> decoupled the
vendor-specific parts of Android from the rest of the stack.  But that
resulted in a big conglomeration of vendor drivers and kernel common code,
so it did not really fully decouple the two.  Since then,
the kernel piece has been separated into the generic kernel image (GKI),
along with GKI modules that are common, and the hardware-specific drivers
that access the GKI via a stable ABI/API.
</p>

<p>
The stable interfaces are not something that is wanted upstream, he said.
Maintaining stable interfaces will not be done for the
mainline; the intent is to do it for trees based on the stable long-term support (LTS)
branches.  Dhaval Giani asked if the plan was to have the same interface for,
say, both 4.9.x and 4.14.x, but Männich said that the intent was only for
it to apply to
a single LTS branch.  So, for example, all Android kernels in the 4.19.x series
would be compatible, but not with those in a 5.x kernel.
</p>

<p>
K. Y. Srinivasan asked if Google had given up on the idea of forcing
everyone to put their code into the tree.  Männich said that the company encouraged
that.  Greg Kroah-Hartman said that he "would love for everybody to be in
the tree"; "talk to Qualcomm, please".  The Android project is
unfortunately working with vendors that are not in the tree, he said;  he
is working on that problem independently, "but we also have to deal with
the real world".  Tim Bird wondered if this plan would impose any
constraints on the kinds of changes that would be accepted into the LTS
branches, but Kroah-Hartman said that it would not.
</p>

<p>
In order to make this work, Android will need to find a kernel
configuration that works for all of the vendors, Männich said.  Android
is still one step shy of having reproducible builds as it is still working on
hermetic kernel builds, where all of the toolchains and dependencies, including
utilities like <tt>uname</tt>, are packaged and used separately from the underlying
system where the kernel is being built.
</p>

<p>
To reduce the scope of the problem, it is important to have ways to define
what is and is not part of the ABI, he said.  There will be whitelists and
blacklists to facilitate that.  There may be other mechanisms as well.
</p>

<p>
Currently, Android is only targeting the  android-4.19 and android-5.x
series—x has not yet been decided—for the
stable ABI.  There will be one GKI configuration for the kernel, though it
may be somewhat different 
for each architecture that is supported.  It only targets Clang builds in a
hermetic environment, so the compiler and other tools cannot change over
the life of the Android kernel.
</p>

<p>
In terms of the scope, the stable ABI only applies to the observable ABI.
Instead of looking at the code, the project looks at the binary of the
kernel to determine what the ABI is.  The developers are working on
whitelists and he is hopeful that <a href="/Articles/760045/">symbol
namespaces</a> get merged so that parts of the stable ABI can be defined in terms of
which namespaces are supported.
</p>

<p>
An attendee wondered if other distributions actually cared that much about
the stable ABI problem.  Several attendees answered that some did because they had
customers who care.  In some cases, like a popular desktop graphics driver,
the source is not available to just rebuild the module for a new kernel,
Laura Abbott said.  Developers of those out-of-tree drivers can and do
update the drivers, but if a distribution wants to ensure the drivers
simply keep on working, enforcing a stable ABI would do that, she said.
</p>

<h4>libabigail</h4>

<p>
Android uses <a href="https://sourceware.org/libabigail/">libabigail</a> to
analyze the kernel ABI.  Libabigail is both a library and a set of tools;
Android mostly just uses the tools to extract and serialize/deserialize the ABI description
from the kernel and module binaries.  Originally, libabigail only used the
ELF and DWARF information, 
but more recently has added support for the kernel by looking at
<tt>ksymtab</tt> rather than the ELF symbol table.  It will generate an
in-memory data structure that describes the ABI that it finds; that data
structure can be serialized to XML, which can then be compared to
previous or future versions of the ABI.
</p>

<p>
Bird wondered if this tool should be added to the upstream kernel
Makefile.  Kroah-Hartman and Männich agreed that it would add a kernel
dependency on an external tool, which is probably not desirable.  It is
easy to simply invoke the tool on the kernel build tree after it is built,
Männich said.
</p>

<p>
Giani asked whether the entire observable ABI needs to match between
versions.  That is where suppression and whitelists come into play,
Männich said.  Giani suggested that a full whitelist approach might be the
way to go since the Android project knows all of the drivers and
hardware-specific pieces that it wants to support.  Otherwise, it risks
growing the supported ABI to an unnecessarily large size.
</p>

<p>
Männich said that the configuration of the Android kernel is not
terribly large.  It is much smaller than a standard distribution
configuration.  In addition, he is hoping to see symbol namespaces, which
will make it even easier to pick and choose pieces to use.  The problem
with a whitelist-only approach is 
that certain parts of the ABI may obviously not be of interest, for example
the filesystem interfaces, but they may define structures and types that
are used elsewhere, another Android team member said.  So the process has
been to try to remove pieces to bring the size of the stable ABI down.
</p>

<p>
Ben Hutchings asked about ABI changes that are still backward compatible;
how are those handled?  Männich said that some of that is still a work in progress.
Libabigail maintainer Dodji Seketeli said that there are suppressions
available that he likened to those for <a
href="http://www.valgrind.org">Valgrind</a>.  The suppressions can indicate
changes that are known not to be problematic from an ABI standpoint.
</p>

<p>
Sasha Levin asked about kernel changes that do not manifest as ABI changes,
such as locking semantics; can those be represented and tracked?  Männich
said that there are some things that cannot currently be handled, but that
they are being worked on; he pointed to an example of an untagged <tt>enum</tt> value
being returned as an integer from a function.  If the enum values are
rearranged, it changes 
the ABI but is not flagged by libabigail.  Seketeli said that all types
could be added to the ABI that the tool is tracking, not just those that
appear in function signatures, but that they are not right now
to keep memory usage down.
</p>

<p>
In general, things like locking semantics don't change in an LTS branch,
the other Android project member said.  If you care about locking semantics, you
have to care about all of the ABI semantics; there will likely sometimes be
problems in that area, but the project will have to find them on its own as
the tooling is not going to help, he said.
</p>

<p>
As time for the session ran out, Männich quickly went over how the ABI
tooling is
integrated into the Android process.  Basically everyone who builds an
Android kernel will get the toolchain and tools, including libabigail, as
part of the "<tt>repo&nbsp;sync</tt>" command to update their tree.  The
ABI generation and a diff against the baseline ABI 
will be run as part of the overall build process; any changes to the ABI
will then bubble up to the <a
href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com">Gerrit</a> code review tool that
Android uses.  The tools are pretty generic, so they should be easily
integrated into other workflows.

Good to know there is automation. This is done manually today by Red Hat and Oracle (UEK) kernel who maintains stable KABI by using whitelists. <br>
There is also padding done for certain Kernel structures to make room for keeping stable ABI for the life of the kernel based on one stable tree release. <br>
As is evident, the stable KABI is required for  any out of tree kernel drivers. This an be reduced if vendors contribute back to upstream on a timely manner. <br>

      <p>The conversation about kABIs in this article is pretty reasonable, but one thing I worry about is that Google acquiescing to creating a stabilized kABI for Android systems will actually further <i>reduce</i> the incentive for the Android ecosystem to contribute to the mainline kernel.</p>

<p>There isn't <i>that much</i> incentive as it stands, admittedly, but it would be nice to see actions taken to <i>increase</i> incentives (maybe a stronger carrot and stick approach?) to contribute to mainline with FOSS drivers...</p>

<h1>Trees I: Radix trees</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 13, 2006 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel includes a number of library routines for the implementation of
useful data structures.  Among those are two types of trees: radix trees
and red-black trees.  This article will have a look at the radix tree API,
with red-black trees to follow in the future.
<p>

Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree">a radix
tree article</a>, but Linux radix trees are not well described by that
article.  A Linux radix tree is a mechanism by which a (pointer) value can
be associated with a (long) integer key.  It is reasonably efficient in terms of
storage, and is quite quick on lookups.  Additionally, radix trees in the
Linux kernel have some features driven by kernel-specific needs, including
the ability to associate tags with specific entries.
<p>

alt="[radix tree node]" align="right" hspace=2 border=0>

The cheesy diagram on the right shows a leaf node from a Linux radix tree.
The node contains a number of slots, each of which can contain a pointer to
something of interest to the creator of the tree.  Empty slots contain a
<tt>NULL</tt> pointer.  These trees are quite broad - in the 2.6.16-rc
kernels, there are 64 slots in each radix tree node.  Slots are indexed by
a portion of the (long) integer key.  If the highest key value is less than
64, the entire tree can be represented with a single node.

Normally, however, a rather larger set of keys is in use - otherwise, a
simple array could have been used.  So a larger tree might look something
like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/radix-tree-2.png" width=602 height=332 
alt="[big radix tree]" border=0>
</center>
<p>
This tree is three levels deep.  When the kernel goes to look up a specific
key, the most significant six bits will be used to find the appropriate
slot in the root node.  The next six bits then index the slot in the middle
node, and the least significant six bits will indicate the slot containing a
pointer to the actual value.  Nodes which have no children are not present
in the tree, so a radix tree can provide efficient storage for sparse
trees.
<p>
Radix trees have a few users in the mainline kernel tree.  The PowerPC
architecture uses a tree to map between real and virtual IRQ numbers.  The
NFS code attaches a tree to relevant <tt>inode</tt> structures to keep
track of outstanding requests.  The most widespread use of radix trees,
however, is in the memory management code.  The <tt>address_space</tt>
structure used to keep track of backing store contains a radix tree which
tracks in-core pages tied to that mapping.  Among other things, this tree
allows the memory management code to quickly find pages which are dirty or
under writeback.
<p>

As is typical with kernel data structures, there are two modes for
declaring and initializing radix trees:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/radix-tree.h&gt;

    RADIX_TREE(name, gfp_mask);  /* Declare and initialize */

    struct radix_tree_root my_tree;
    INIT_RADIX_TREE(my_tree, gfp_mask);
</pre>
<p>

The first form declares and initializes a radix tree with the given
<tt>name</tt>; the second form performs the initialization at run time.  In
either case, a <tt>gfp_mask</tt> must be provided to tell the code how
memory allocations are to be performed.  If radix tree operations
(insertions, in particular) are to be performed in atomic context, the
given mask should be <tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt>.
<p>

The functions for adding and removing entries are straightforward:
<p>
<pre>
    int radix_tree_insert(struct radix_tree_root *tree, unsigned long key, 
                          void *item);
    void *radix_tree_delete(struct radix_tree_root *tree, unsigned long key);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>radix_tree_insert()</tt> will cause the given <tt>item</tt>
to be inserted (associated with <tt>key</tt>) in the given <tt>tree</tt>.  This
operation may require memory allocations; should an allocation fail, the
insertion will fail and the return value will be <tt>-ENOMEM</tt>.  The
code will refuse to overwrite an existing entry; if <tt>key</tt> already
exists in the tree, <tt>radix_tree_insert()</tt> will return
<tt>-EEXIST</tt>.  On success, the return value is zero.
<tt>radix_tree_delete()</tt> removes the item associated with <tt>key</tt>
from <tt>tree</tt>, returning a pointer to that item if it was present.
<p>
There are situations where failure to insert an item into a radix tree can
be a significant problem.  To help avoid such situations, a pair of specialized
functions are provided:
<p>
<pre>
    int radix_tree_preload(gfp_t gfp_mask);
    void radix_tree_preload_end(void);
</pre>
<p>
This function will attempt to allocate sufficient memory (using the given
<tt>gfp_mask</tt>) to guarantee that the next radix tree insertion cannot
fail.  The allocated structures are stored in a per-CPU variable, meaning
that the calling function must perform the insertion before it can schedule
or be moved to a different processor.  To that end,
<tt>radix_tree_preload()</tt> will, when successful, return with preemption
disabled; the caller must eventually ensure that preemption is enabled
again by calling <tt>radix_tree_preload_end()</tt>.  On failure,
<tt>-ENOMEM</tt> is returned and preemption is <i>not</i> disabled.
<p>

Radix tree lookups can be done in a few ways:
<p>
<pre>
    void *radix_tree_lookup(struct radix_tree_root *tree, unsigned long key);
    void **radix_tree_lookup_slot(struct radix_tree_root *tree, unsigned long key);
    unsigned int radix_tree_gang_lookup(struct radix_tree_root *root, 
                                        void **results,
					unsigned long first_index, 
					unsigned int max_items);
</pre>
<p>
The simplest form, <tt>radix_tree_lookup()</tt>, looks for <tt>key</tt> in
the <tt>tree</tt> and returns the associated item (or <tt>NULL</tt> on
failure).  <tt>radix_tree_lookup_slot()</tt> will, instead, return a
pointer to the slot holding the pointer to the item.  The caller can, then,
change the pointer to associate a new item with the <tt>key</tt>.  If the
item does not exist, however, <tt>radix_tree_lookup_slot()</tt> will not
create a slot for it, so this function cannot be used in place of
<tt>radix_tree_insert()</tt>.  
<p>
Finally, a call to <tt>radix_tree_gang_lookup()</tt> will return up to
<tt>max_items</tt> items in <tt>results</tt>, with ascending key values
starting at <tt>first_index</tt>.  The number of items returned may be less
than requested, but a short return (other than zero) does not imply that
there are no more values in the tree.
<p>

One should note that none of the radix tree
functions perform any sort of locking internally.  It is up to the caller
to ensure that multiple threads do not corrupt the tree or get into other
sorts of unpleasant race conditions.  Nick Piggin currently has a patch
circulating which would use read-copy-update to free tree nodes; this patch
would allow lookup operations to be performed without locking as long as
(1)&nbsp;the resulting pointer is only used in atomic context, and
(2)&nbsp;the calling code avoids creating race conditions of its own.  It
is not clear when that patch might be merged, however.
<p>

The radix tree code supports a feature called "tags," wherein specific bits
can be set on items in the tree.  Tags are used, for example, to mark
memory pages which are dirty or under writeback.  The API for working with
tags is:
<p>
<pre>
    void *radix_tree_tag_set(struct radix_tree_root *tree,
			unsigned long key, int tag);
    void *radix_tree_tag_clear(struct radix_tree_root *tree,
			unsigned long key, int tag);
    int radix_tree_tag_get(struct radix_tree_root *tree,
			unsigned long key, int tag);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>radix_tree_tag_set()</tt> will set the given <tt>tag</tt> on the item
indexed by <tt>key</tt>; it is an error to attempt to set a tag on a
nonexistent key.  The return value will be a pointer to the tagged item.
While <tt>tag</tt> looks like an arbitrary integer, the
code as currently written allows for a maximum of two tags.  Use of any tag
value other than zero or one will silently corrupt memory in some
undesirable place; consider yourself warned.  
<p>
Tags can be removed with <tt>radix_tree_tag_clear()</tt>; once again, the
return value is a pointer to the (un)tagged item.  The function
<tt>radix_tree_tag_get()</tt> will check whether the item indexed by
<tt>key</tt> has the given <tt>tag</tt> set; the return value is zero if
<tt>key</tt> is not present, -1 if <tt>key</tt> is present but <tt>tag</tt>
is not set, and +1 otherwise.  This function is currently commented out in
the source, however, since no in-tree code uses it.
<p>
There are two other functions for querying tags:
<p>
<pre>
    int radix_tree_tagged(struct radix_tree_root *tree, int tag);
    unsigned int radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag(struct radix_tree_root *tree, 
                                            void **results,
					    unsigned long first_index, 
					    unsigned int max_items, 
					    int tag);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>radix_tree_tagged()</tt> returns a non-zero value if any item in the
tree bears the given <tt>tag</tt>.  A list of items with a given tag can be
obtained with <tt>radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag()</tt>.
<p>

In concluding, we can note one other interesting aspect of the radix tree
API: there is no function for destroying a radix tree.  It is, evidently,
assumed that radix trees will last forever.  In practice, deleting all
items from a radix tree will free all memory associated with it other than
the root node, which can then be disposed of normally.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I wonder what's magic about 64, other than that it's 6 bits?  On a 32-bit architecture, that's 256 bytes of storage for the 64 pointers.  On a machine like the Athlon, cache lines are 64 bytes, which means each node of the tree occupies 4 cache lines.  In an SMP context, is there an advantage to sizing the nodes down to occupy a single cache line, or is there a sort of hashing benefit to having each node require multiple cache lines?  e.g. Would I get more pingponging or less if the nodes were smaller?  Does the answer change based on # of CPUs?<br>

      The designer of Judy trees has expressed wonder at why anybody ever talks about binary trees (e.g. red-black trees) any more, since his measurements indicate that no matter what you do, their performance always stinks compared to modern cache-aware techniques.  The only reasonable explanation is the same as the reason university graduates, once, all knew ancient Greek, and had studied geometry but not calculus.<br>

Also the fastest hash table in the world is "burst trie", not judy arrays. Linux can use fork of "burst trie" idea named "hat trie" in future. It is more memory efficient. These ideas are free, no patents.<br>

How well would this apply to large addresses (i.e IPv6)? It has 64 slots, so will it be able to hold addresses much larger than 64 bits? Thank you<br>

How do you iterate/traverse through a radix tree and print out its contents to the console. Can we use gang_lookup() or is there any other API for that?<br>

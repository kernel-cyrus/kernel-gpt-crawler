<h1>The end of the 3.12 merge window</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 17, 2013</br>
           </div>
Despite <a href="/Articles/566948/">toying with</a> the idea of closing the
merge window rather earlier than expected, Linus did, in the end, keep it
open until September&nbsp;16.  He repeated past grumbles about
maintainers who send their pull requests at the very end of the merge
window, though; increasingly, it seems that wise maintainers should behave
as if the merge window were a single week in length.  Pull requests that
are sent too late run a high risk of being deferred until the next
development cycle.
<p>
In the end, 9,479 non-merge changesets were pulled into the mainline
repository for the 3.12 merge window; about 1,000 of those came in after
the writing of <a href="/Articles/566122/">last week's summary</a>.
Few of the changes merged in the final days of the merge window were hugely
exciting, but there have been a number of new features and improvements.
Some of the more significant, user-visible changes include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Unlike its predecessor, the 3.12 kernel will not be known as "Linux 
     for Workgroups."  Instead, for reasons that are not entirely clear,
     the new code name was "Suicidal Squirrel" for a few days; it then was
     changed to "One giant leap for frogkind."
<p>
<li> It is now possible to provide block device partition tables on the
     kernel command line; see <a
     href="/Articles/566549/">Documentation/block/cmdline-partition.txt</a>
     for details.

</blockquote>
<p>
<li> The memory management subsystem has gained the ability to migrate huge
     pages between NUMA nodes.
<p>
<li> The Btrfs filesystem has the beginning of support for offline
     deduplication of data blocks.  A new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
     (<tt>BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME</tt>) can be used by a user-space
     program to inform the kernel of extents in two different files that
     contain the same data.  The kernel will, after checking that the
     data is indeed the same, cause the two files to share a single copy of
     that data.
<p>
<li> The HFS+ filesystem now supports POSIX access control lists.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/562211/#oom">reliable out-of-memory killer
     patches</a> have been merged.  This work should make OOM handling more
     robust, but it could possibly confuse user-space applications by
     returning "out of memory" errors in situations where such errors were
     not seen before.
<p>
<li> The evdev input layer has gained a new <tt>EVIOCREVOKE</tt>
     <tt>ioctl()</tt> command that revokes all access to a given file
     descriptor.  It can be used to ensure that no evil processes lurk on
     an input device across sessions.  See <a
     href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2013-August/012897.html">this
     patch</a> for an example of how this functionality can be used.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  MOXA ART real-time clocks,
	  Freescale i.MX SoC temperature sensors,
	  Allwinner A10/A13 watchdog devices,
	  Freescale PAMU I/O memory management units,
	  TI LP8501 LED controllers,
	  Cavium OCTEON GPIO controllers, and
	  Mediatek/Ralink RT3883 PCI controllers,
     <p>
     <li> <b>Networking</b>:
     	  Intel i40e Ethernet interfaces.
     </ul>

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The seqlock locking primitive has gained a new "locking reader" type.
     Normally, seqlocks allow for data structures to be changed while being
     accessed by readers; the readers are supposed to detect the change (by
     checking the sequence number) and retry if need be.  Some types of
     readers cannot tolerate changes to the structure, though; in current
     kernels, they take an expensive write lock instead.  The "locking
     reader" lock will block writers and other locking readers, but allow
     normal readers through.  Note that locking readers <i>could</i> share
     access with each other;
     the fact that this sharing does not happen now is an implementation
     limitation.  The functions for working with this type of 
     lock are:
<p>
<pre>
    void read_seqlock_excl(seqlock_t *sl);
    void read_sequnlock_excl(seqlock_t *sl);
</pre>
<p>
     There are also the usual variants for blocking hardware and software
     interrupts; the full set can be found in
     <tt>&lt;linux/seqlock.h&gt;</tt>. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/550463/">new shrinker API</a> has been merged.
     Most code using this API needed to be changed; the result should be
     better performance and a better-defined, more robust API.  The new
     "LRU list" mechanism that was a part of that patch set has also been
     merged.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/555189/">per-CPU IDA</a> ID allocator patch set
     has been merged.
</ul>
<p>

Now begins the stabilization phase for the 3.12 kernel. If the usual
pattern holds, the final release can be expected on or shortly after
Halloween; whether it turns out to be a "trick" or a "treat" depends on how
well the testing goes between now and then.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What is the use for putting the partition table in the kernel command line?<br>
It says it saves space by not needing the mbr, but doesn't this mean that the partition table is moved somewhere else instead, since the bootloader needs to read it and generate the kernel command line anyway?<br>

I believe it's good for partitions on flash that need to be aligned to some large blocks.  It's better to sacrifice a hundred bytes in CMOS and in RAM than to lose 256k on a system that is tight on the flash space.<br>

      <blockquote>The evdev input layer has gained a new EVIOCREVOKE ioctl() command that revokes all access to a given file descriptor</blockquote>

i.e. revoke() for input fds, just what the X people have been asking for for ages for non-root X server support but that never got in? Did it only get in because it was an (ew) ioctl(), rather than a new syscall like the BSDs use?

Yes, exactly.  It got in because it was input-specific, rather than attempting to be generic across all fd types.  This was originally known as EVIOCMUTE, but then got changed around.<br>

David Herrmann is working on it, and he's also got an imo really good plan for how to solve the revoke issue for drm device nodes. See his blog at <a href="http://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/sane-session-switching/">http://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/sane-session-switc...</a> for the Big Plan. Note that the rendernode stuff merged into 3.12 is part of the prep work here - we first need to untangle the drm render (which can be done by multiple users concurrently, e.g. for background gpgpu stuff) and the modeset side which needs something like revoke.<br>

So... unprivileged X, as long as I rip highly stable parts of my system apart and move to systemd? Sigh, why am I not surprised. Any excuse to wedge systemd in somewhere else, and they'll take it...<br>
<p>
Maybe a simple replacement for logind in this scenario is possible (it's only being used as a simple message-passer, after all) which doesn't require drinking all the world-encompassing systemd kool-aid.<br>

Also, running logind does not require running, or even installing, systemd (though you can't build one without building the other). An upstart/logind or sysvinit/logind setup would require slightly more configuration than a systemd/logind setup, but really no more (but of course different) configuration compared to an upstart/ConsoleKit or sysvinit/ConsoleKit setup, so not out of reach of the distro packagers.<br>

As of systemd-205, this is no longer true.  In that version, systemd-logind lost support for creating its own cgroups (which it requires to operate), instead delegating that responsibility to systemd, which already has to be able to create them for its own purposes.<br>

This actually makes sense since systemd is on its way to being /the/ cgroup manager. Taking logind and patching it to call your own cgroup manager (or patching the functionality back in) is probably easier than resurrecting ConsoleKit.<br>

System calls suddenly starting to return ENOMEM is a critical and catastrophic ABI breakage.<br>

Lots of things will now malfunction in random ways under OOM conditions (since, of course, syscall return values are almost never checked).<br>

OOM conditions are generally times of massive problems for apps.<br>
<p>
remember that most systems have the sane setting of using CoW for memory, so they don't get errors when the memory is allocated, but instead sometime later when something dirties ram.<br>
<p>
I call this the sane setting, because disabling overcommit and requiring that your system not do the CoW trick ends up wasting so much of your ram that you end up with far more failures, and the vast majority of code doesn't check for errors even in those cases.<br>

<p>
do they really work better? or is it just theory that they work better?<br>
<p>
If overcommit is enabled, the out of memory error isn't that likely to happen when memory is allocated, or a process forks. It's going to happen when memory is used (a variable changed, etc)<br>
<p>
but if you turn off overcommit, you either need such a ridiculously large amount of swap that your system will be essentially dead from swapping long before you hit OOM, or you end up being unable to really use all your memory because large chunks of it are reserved for the 'just in case' situation that every CoW page will get split that never happens. <br>

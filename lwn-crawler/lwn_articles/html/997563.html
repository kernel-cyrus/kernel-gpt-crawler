           </div>
Direct memory access (DMA) I/O is simple in concept: a peripheral device
moves data directly to or from memory while the CPU is busy doing other
things.  As is so often the case, DMA is rather more complicated in
practice, and the kernel has developed a complicated internal API to
support it.  It turns out that the DMA API, as it exists now, can affect
the performance of some high-bandwidth devices.  In an effort to address
that problem, Leon Romanovsky is making the API even more complex with <a
href="/ml/all/cover.1731244445.git.leon@kernel.org">this patch series</a>
adding a new two-step mapping API.
<p>
<h4>DMA challenges</h4>
<p>
In the early days, a device driver would initiate a DMA operation by
passing the physical address of a memory buffer to the device and telling
it to go.  There are a number of reasons why things cannot be so simple on
current systems, though, including:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The device may not be able to reach the buffer.  ISA devices were
     limited to 24-bit DMA addresses, for example, so any memory located
     above that range was inaccessible to those devices.  More recently,
     many devices were still limited to 32-bit addresses, though hopefully
     that situation has improved over time.  If a buffer is out of a
     device's reach, it must be copied into reachable memory (a practice
     known as "bounce buffering") before setting up the I/O operation.
<li> The combination of memory caching in the CPU and DMA can lead to
     inconsistent views of the data held in memory — the device cannot see
     data that exists only in the cache, for example.  If not properly
     managed, cache consistency (or the lack thereof) can lead to data
     corruption, which is usually deemed to be a bad thing.
<li> The buffer involved in a transfer may be scattered throughout physical
     memory; for larger transfers, it is almost guaranteed to be.  The
     kernel's DMA layer manages the scatter/gather lists ("scatterlists")
     needed to describe these operations.
<li> Modern systems often do not give devices direct access to the physical
     memory space; instead, that access is managed through an I/O
     memory-management unit (IOMMU), which creates an independent
     address space for peripheral devices.  Any DMA operation requires
     setting up a mapping within the IOMMU to allow the device to access
     the buffer.  An IOMMU can make a physically scattered buffer look
     contiguous to a device. It may also be able to prevent the device from
     accessing memory outside of the buffer; this capability is necessary
     to safely allow virtual machines to directly access I/O devices.
<li> DMA operations between two peripheral devices (without involving main
     memory at all) — <a href="/Articles/767281/">P2PDMA</a> — add a whole
     new level of complexity.
</ul>
<p>
To top it all off, a device driver usually cannot be written with a
knowledge of the organization of every system on which it will run, so it
must be able to adapt to the DMA-mapping requirements it finds.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
All of this calls out for a kernel layer to abstract the
DMA-mapping task and present a uniform interface to device drivers.  The
kernel <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/dma-api.html">has such a
layer</a>, which has been present in something close to its current form
for some years.  At the core of this layer is the scatterlist API.  As
Romanovsky notes in the patch cover letter, though, this API has been
showing signs of strain for some time.
<p>
Scatterlists are used heavily in the DMA API, but they are fundamentally
based on the kernel's <tt>page</tt> structure, which describes a single
page of memory.  That makes scatterlists unable to deal with larger groupings of
pages (folios) without splitting them into individual pages.  Being based
on <tt>struct page</tt> also complicates P2PDMA; since only device memory
is involved for those operations, there are no <tt>page</tt> structures to
use.  Increasingly, I/O operations are already represented in the kernel in
a different form (an array of <tt>bio</tt> structures for a block
operation, for example), reformatting that information into a scatterlist
is mostly unnecessary overhead.  So there has been interest in improving or
replacing scatterlists for some time; see <a href="/Articles/931943/">the
phyr discussion from 2023</a> for example.  So far, though, scatterlists
have proved resistant to these efforts.
<p>
<h4>Splitting things up</h4>
<p>
Romanovsky has set out to create a DMA API that will address many of the
complaints about scatterlists while improving performance.  The core idea,
he says is to "<q>instead split up the DMA API to allow callers to bring
their own data structure</q>".  The split, in this case, is between the
allocation of an I/O virtual address (IOVA) space for an operation and the
mapping of memory into that space.  This new API is intended to be a
supplemental option on high-end systems with IOMMUs; it will not replace
the existing DMA API.
<p>
The first step when using this new API is to allocate a range of IOVA space
to be used with the upcoming transfer(s):
<p>
<pre>
    bool dma_iova_try_alloc(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
			    phys_addr_t phys, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
This function will attempt to allocate a <tt>size</tt>-byte IOVA range for
use by the given device (<tt>dev</tt>).  The <tt>phys</tt> argument only
indicates the necessary alignment for this range; for devices that only
require page alignment, passing zero will work.  The <tt>state</tt>
structure must be provided by the caller, but will be completely
initialized by this call.
<p>
If the allocation attempt is successful, this function will return
<tt>true</tt> and the physical address of the range (as seen by the device)
will be stored in <tt>state.addr</tt>.  Otherwise, the return value will be
<tt>false</tt>, and the older DMA API must be used instead.  Thus, the new
API does not enable the removal of scatterlist support from any drivers; it
just provides a higher-performance alternative on systems where it is
supported.
<p>
If the allocation is successful, the result is an allocated range of IOVA
space that does not yet map to anything.  The driver can map ranges of
memory into this IOVA area with:
<p>
<pre>
    int dma_iova_link(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
		      phys_addr_t phys, size_t offset, size_t size,
		      enum dma_data_direction dir, unsigned long attrs);
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>dev</tt> is the device that will be performing the I/O (the same
one that was used to allocate the IOVA space),
<tt>state</tt> is the state structure used to allocate the address range,
<tt>phys</tt> is the physical address of the memory range to map,
<tt>offset</tt> is the offset into the IOVA range where this memory should
be mapped, <tt>size</tt> is the size of the range to be mapped,
<tt>dir</tt> describes the I/O direction (whether data is moving to or from
the device), and <tt>attrs</tt> holds the optional <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11.6/source/include/linux/dma-mapping.h#L15">attributes</a>
that can modify the mapping.  The return value will be zero (for success)
or a negative error code.
<p>
Once all of the memory has been mapped, the driver should make a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int dma_iova_sync(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
 		      size_t offset, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
This call will synchronize the I/O translation lookaside buffer (an
expensive operation that should only be done once, after the mapping is
complete) for the indicated range of the IOVA area.  Then the I/O operation
can be initiated.
<p>
Afterward, portions of the IOVA range can be unmapped with:
<p>
<pre>
    void dma_iova_unlink(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
			 size_t offset, size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir,
			 unsigned long attrs);
</pre>
<p>
Once all the mappings have been unlinked, the IOVA can be freed with:
<p>
<pre>
    void dma_iova_free(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state);
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void dma_iova_destroy(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
			  size_t mapped_len, enum dma_data_direction dir,
			  unsigned long attrs);
</pre>
<p>
will unmap the entire range (up to <tt>mapped_len</tt>), then free the IOVA
allocation.
<p>
In summary, Romanovsky is proposing an API that can be used to map a
scattered set of buffers into a single, contiguous IOVA range.  There is no
need to create a separate scatterlist data structure to represent this
operation, and there is no need to use <tt>page</tt> structures to refer to
the memory.

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>
This API has been through a few revisions at this point, and some
developers, at least, are happy with it.  While the new API provides
improved performance for some use cases, Jens Axboe has <a
href="/ml/all/3144b6e7-5c80-46d2-8ddc-a71af3c23072@kernel.dk/">observed</a>
performance regressions within the block layer that are not yet understood.
For now, Romanovsky has <a
href="/ml/all/20241031090530.GC7473@unreal/">removed</a> some of the
block-layer changes that he deems to be the most likely source of the
problem.
<p>
Robin Murphy has, instead, <a
href="/ml/all/3567312e-5942-4037-93dc-587f25f0778c@arm.com/">questioned</a>
one of the core assumptions of this API: that there is value in mapping
scatter/gather operations into a contiguous IOVA range:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	TBH I doubt there are many actual scatter-gather-capable devices
	with significant enough limitations to meaningfully benefit from
	DMA segment combining these days - I've often thought that by now
	it might be a good idea to turn that behaviour off by default and
	add an attribute for callers to explicitly request it.
</blockquote>
<p>
Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/all/20241104095831.GA28751@lst.de/">responded</a> that devices
often perform better with a contiguous IOVA range, even if they are able to
handle a severely fragmented one.  Jason Gunthorpe <a
href="/ml/all/20241105195357.GI35848@ziepe.ca/">agreed</a>, saying that
RDMA operations see "<q>big wins</q>" when the IOVA range is contiguous.
So it does appear that there is a need for this capability.
<p>
The patch set seems to have reasonably broad support, and the rate of
change appears to be slowing.  There are, of course, possible improvements
to the API that could be considered; Gunthorpe mentioned better control
over alignment in the above-linked message, for example, but those can come
later.  Romanovsky has <a
href="/ml/all/20241114133011.GA606631@unreal">asked</a> that it be merged
for 6.13 so that drivers can easily start to use it.  While there are no
guarantees at this point (and some <a
href="/ml/all/20241114163622.GA3121@lst.de">resistance to the idea</a>), it
seems possible that the next kernel will include a new, high-performance
DMA API.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

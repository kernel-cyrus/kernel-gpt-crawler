</div>
Automated testing of the kernel has never been as comprehensive as one might
like.  To an extent, things will always have to be that way, in that many
kernel issues are related to specific hardware or workloads that the
developers have no access to.  But, even with that in mind, it is not hard
to believe that there could be more testing done than happens now.  At the
2015 Kernel Summit, Shuah Khan and Masami Hiramatsu ran a session on where
kernel testing stands and what is likely to happen in the near future.
<p>
Shuah started by noting that the kernel's automated testing framework was
merged in the 3.17 development cycle.  In the last year, the
<tt>kselftest</tt> target has been added to the main makefile, so running
the tests is a matter of a single command.  There is also an
<tt>install</tt> target that is useful for regression testing or for
testing that requires cross-compilation.  New tests have been added for the
timekeeping, realtime clock, futex, and ftrace subsystems.
<p>
Ben Hutchings asked whether developers should expect all of the tests
to pass, given that he has been seeing a lot of failures.  It turns out
that many of the tests are dependent on specific configuration options, but
there is currently no way to limit which tests are run based on how the current
kernel is configured.  So, for many configurations, test failures are
indeed to be expected, and it's hard to know which of those indicate real
problems.  This problem was mentioned a few times during the session.
<p>
Andy Lutomirski added that there is one x86 test that always fails.  He
found the problem after it had been present for several <tt>-rc</tt>
releases.  That indicates to him that not many people are running the
tests in any regular way; he would like to see that change.
<p>
Masami added that a lot of people now depend on Linux worldwide, so we can't
afford to ship kernels that do not work properly.  He said that the
reporting of bugs is often slow, even when the existing tests catch them.
Once again, that suggests that the tests are not being run that often.  If

developers would make a habit of running the tests before sending in a
patch, we would introduce fewer of these bugs in the first place.  Linus
asked whether the <a href="/Articles/514278/">zero-day robot</a> is running
at least a subset of tests; the 
answer was that it is indeed doing so.
<p>
Kevin Hilman talked about ARM testing briefly.  The ARM world, he said, has
a lot of "creative hardware designers" that add a unique challenge of their
own.  He has been collecting a bunch of hardware test scripts and running
automated boot tests, with results that can be seen at <a
href="http://kernelci.org/">kernelci.org</a>.  The kselftest tests
have been added into the mix.   Kevin, too, noted that he has run into
trouble from dependencies on configuration settings.  He would like to see
a better structure for the automatic tests, one that makes the dependencies
clear.  If a proper test-definition framework could be put together, it
would make it easier to run the tests on a broader range of hardware and
kernel configurations.
<p>
The tests, he said, are being run on as many boards as possible.  He is
still not sending out results, though, because he is still getting a lot of
test failures.  The tests are evolving quickly, and he would like them to
stabilize a bit before he integrates them into his reports.  Luis Rodriguez
suggested that some sort of "confidence" tag attached to each test could
help in deciding which ones to run.  In response to a question from James
Bottomley, Kevin said that the tests are run each time linux-next
changes, since he does not have the hardware to run them with finer granularity.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that the xfstests suite has a way of annotating tests that
have been skipped for some reason; it would be nice, he said, if kselftest
had that too.  As things stand now, there are lots of failures reported, and
that can cause real problems to be missed.  Tim Bird added that it would be
nice to have a mechanism to turn on all the configuration options needed
to run a complete set of tests; there is no way to find out what those
options are now.  When new tests are added, he said, they should include
documentation on which kernel configuration options they need.
<p>
Andy suggested annotating how long the tests are expected to take, noting
that running 
the full set can take a while.  Shuah said that there is a "quick tests
only" option now, but it only works when the tests are built and run on the
same system.  Adding the option to the <tt>install</tt> target is on the
to-do list.  Are there requirements for external libraries to run the
tests?  There are none currently.  There may be a need to add external
dependencies in the future, but the tests need to fail gracefully if those
dependencies are not available.
<p>
James asked about driver testing.  Drivers tend to be the hardest thing to
test, since they are deeply tied to specific hardware.  Dan Williams has
evidently been working on mocking hardware resources to allow a certain
amount of testing; this work has been used for libnvdimm (persistent
memory) development.  Herbert Xu said it would be nice to have a simple
testing package to give to people who actually have specific hardware
available.
<p>
Johannes Berg said that there is a certain tension between the desire to
add new tests and the need to keep their runtime within limits.  The WiFi
stack currently has a set of 1,600 tests that "takes forever" to run.
These tests also exercise the user-space parts of the WiFi stack, so he is not
sure they would be appropriate to add to the kernel's self-test suite.
Shuah said that short execution time is not a requirement for tests; we
would like to have them all in the kernel, though it is important to be
able to separate out the fast ones.
<p>
Jan Kara described the "test groups" feature of xfstests.  There is one
group for tests that run quickly, one for those requiring a hard drive,
another for tests that might crash the kernel, and so on.  Such a structure
could be useful for the kernel's tests as well.
<p>
The session ran out of time at this point.  There is little disagreement
about the need for better tests â€” and the need for developers to actually
run those tests.  This is an area that should continue to progress quickly
in the coming year.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Isn't it a great way for newcomers to start kernel development? Testing core functionality doesn't need special hardware, unit tests are not that hard to write (if there's good mocking) and much more useful than whitespace patches... Or were most low hanging fruits already taken and the "easy" tests already written?<br>

      The way to skip tests that depend on a particular configuration option (say, SSE presence on the designated target, as indicated by the __SSE__ #define) is <code>plan_skip_all("thingamabob isn't present, can't go on"); return;</code>. Perhaps a spot of TAP advocacy is warranted; the common "pile of assertions" style of test looks fairly long in the tooth in comparison.

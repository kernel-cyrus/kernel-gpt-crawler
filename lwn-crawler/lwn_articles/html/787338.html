Among the many other things crammed into the <tt>page</tt> structure
that is used
to represent a page of memory in the kernel is a set of flags to track the
state of the page.  These flags have been in short supply for some time;
LWN <a href="/Articles/335768/">looked at the problem</a> nearly ten years
ago.  Jérôme Glisse ran a session during the memory-management track of the
2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit to explore
ways of making some flags available for new uses.  While there may be some
easily available bits in the field that holds the page flags, obtaining a
significant number of them may be tricky. 
<p>
Glisse is looking for a way to add a new, generic page-protection bit in
order to implement a feature like kernel same-page merging (KSM) for
file-backed pages.  There is a flag for KSM now, but it's already
overloaded with the <tt>PageMovable</tt> flag, which is relevant for
file-backed pages.  So, he asked, where might he be able to locate another
flag that could be used for this purpose?
<p>
His attention was drawn to the general area of memory reclaim, which uses
many of the available flags.  The
<tt>PageActive</tt>,
<tt>PageIsolated</tt>,
<tt>PageLRU</tt>,
<tt>PageMovable</tt>,
<tt>PageReclaim</tt>,
<tt>PageReferenced</tt>,
<tt>PageUnevictable</tt>, and
<tt>PageWorkingset</tt> flags are all tied to reclaim in one way or

<a href="/Articles/787387/"><img

another.  Often, when that many flags are associated with an activity, one
can discern patterns of flags that are either always set together or which
never appear together; that can allow the replacement of flags with a more
efficient representation.  In this case, though, he found that almost all
combinations of those flags are possible and valid, so there is no real
opportunity 
to merge any of them.  To further complicate matters, there is no single
lock that protects access to all of those flags, so combining them would
require difficult (or impossible) locking changes.

<p>
Having failed to reclaim any of the reclaim-oriented flags, Glisse turned
his attention to the node ID and zone number, both of which are stored in
the same word as the page flags.  The node ID is frequently used in hot
paths, so trying to move it out of the <tt>page</tt> structure is likely to
create performance issues.  The zone number is not quite as hot and might
be a candidate to be relocated.  Indeed, in some configurations this
information already gets pushed out of the <tt>page</tt> structure, so
there might be some promise here.
<p>
Some low-hanging fruit might also be found in the width of the node ID field; it
is sized to hold the maximum number of NUMA nodes that the kernel is
configured to support — typically 1024.  But there are not all that many
1024-node systems out there; that sizing was described as a holdover from
the days of
SGI's huge systems.  So it may be possible to gain a bit or two there,
though probably not more than that.  It is also possible to calculate the
node ID from the zone number, eliminating that field altogether, but that
would add overhead to some of the hottest page-allocator paths, which would
be unwelcome.
<p>
There was some talk of getting rid of either <tt>PageIsolated</tt> or
<tt>PageMovable</tt>, both of which are optimizations for information that
can be had elsewhere.  <tt>PageIsolated</tt> is there to keep two threads
running compaction from interfering with each other, a situation that,
according to Hugh Dickins, cannot happen anyway.
<p>
Looking at some of the other bits, Matthew Wilcox observed that the
<tt>PageError</tt>, <tt>PageSlab</tt>, and <tt>PageHWPoison</tt> flags are
incompatible with each other and could perhaps be unified in some way.
Indeed, it seems that there is no need for a flag for <tt>PageHWPoison</tt>
(which marks a page that has been taken out of service due to hardware
errors) at all.  To the extent that the kernel needs to reference that
state, it does not need to happen quickly, but most of the time such a page
should be out of the kernel's view entirely.
<p>
Dave Hansen suggested creating a concept of "fast" and "slow" page flags,
where the slow ones are stored outside of the <tt>page</tt> structure.  A
single fast bit could be set when any of the slow ones are, hopefully
eliminating the need to actually check the slow bits most of the time.  Mel
Gorman, instead, suggested that some kernel features could be made
dependent on whether sufficient page flags are available; if the kernel is
configured to support a large number of NUMA nodes, perhaps it would be
unable to support KSM.  But, as Hansen reminded the group, there are not
many bits to be had via that path.
<p>
Another option is to push more data (flags or something else) out to the
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0.11/source/include/linux/page_ext.h#L28"><tt>page_ext</tt>
structure</a>, which already exists to hold information that won't fit into
<tt>struct page</tt>.  Hansen worried, though, that this would make it too
easy to bloat the amount of per-page data stored, which already occupies a
significant fraction of the system's memory.  Without a hard constraint,
that data could easily get out of hand.
<p>
The final suggestion aired in this session was to create an <a
href="/Articles/745073/">XArray</a> to hold pages in relatively rare states
(such as <tt>PageIsolated</tt>).  They could be stored using their
page-frame number and searched for when the need arises.  Whether any of
these suggestions will be implemented remains to be seen, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

On 64-bit x86, 'struct page' is normally 64 bytes per 4k page, which is roughly 1.5%.  It works out to 16MB per 1GB of address space being managed.<br>
<p>
The size is, of course, smaller on architectures and configurations where the base page size is larger than 4k or on 32-bit architectures where pointers and the systems being managed are smaller.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 24, 2016</br>

Control groups (cgroups) perform two basic functions in the kernel: they
allow the hierarchical grouping of processes, and they enable the use of
controllers to apply resource limits to the processes in each group.  Now
there is interest in extending cgroups to allow for the control of network
traffic as well, but there is a significant difference of opinion over the
best way to implement this control.  Naturally, the discussion involves
another kernel technology that seems to be spreading out into all areas:
the Berkeley packet filter (BPF) virtual machine.
<p>
The objective is to be able to apply a filter to network traffic going to
or from any process contained within a given cgroup.  The intent may be to
improve security, by restricting the traffic that a particular system
service or application (contained within its own cgroup) can generate.  Or
it could be a desire for simple resource control or accounting.  Either way,
the point is to have this control at the cgroup level, something that the
kernel does not support now.
<p>
One possible solution, <a href="/Articles/697462/">posted</a> by Daniel
Mack, is to allow a BPF program to be attached to a cgroup.  To that end,
the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call is extended with a new
<tt>BPF_PROG_ATTACH</tt> operation.  Exactly what the program is attached
to depends on the type of the program; for now the only type supported is
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCKET_FILTER</tt>, but the possibility exists
that other types (to make other sorts of policy decisions for cgroups)
could be supported in the future.  Programs may be attached as either
an ingress or an egress filter, controlled by a flag passed to the
<tt>bpf()</tt> call.  Naturally, there is also a
<tt>BPF_PROG_DETACH</tt> operation to remove a BPF program from a cgroup.
<p>
Once the program is attached, it will be run on each packet sent to or from
a process in the cgroup, depending on how it was attached — though only the
ingress side is implemented in the current patch set.  If the program
returns one, the packet will be allowed to pass; otherwise it will be
dropped.
<p>
The idea is thus relatively straightforward; it is similar to the socket
filters that an individual process can apply to a socket it owns now.
Cgroup maintainer Tejun Heo had some quibbles with the implementation, but
had no real objection to the overall design.  It seems like something that
could be added without a whole lot of trouble — except that one developer
has different ideas.
<p>
That developer is Pablo Neira Ayuso, the maintainer of the netfilter
subsystem.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, he <a href="/Articles/698080/">thinks
that the proper solution is based on netfilter</a> rather than BPF; in
particular, he would like to see the establishment of a special table of
rules that could be attached to a cgroup.  In his opinion, a set of rules
that can be queried with existing tools would be easier for administrators
to deal with than a relatively opaque BPF program.  Multiple sets of
netfilter rules can be
composed, while the BPF approach only allows for a single program to be
attached to a cgroup, limiting flexibility in situations where more than
one entity wants to add filtering rules.  A netfilter-based approach could
also take advantage of the connection tracking that, likely, is already
being done, speeding the processing of most packets.  Those reasons, he
says, make netfilter the better tool for this particular job.
<p>
Daniel <a href="/Articles/698085/">acknowledged</a> the downsides
of the BPF implementation, though he was less convinced about the
importance of some of them.  It seems that this project was looking at a
netfilter-based solution early on, but chose to refocus on BPF.  There were
concerns that the netfilter developers did not actually want a cgroup-level
hook, and that the performance of the netfilter system might not be up to
the task.  He summarized things this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The whole 'eBPF in cgroups' idea was born because through the
	discussions over the past months we had on all this, it became
	clear to me that netfilter is not the right place for filtering on
	local tasks. I agree the solution I am proposing in my patch set
	has its downsides, mostly when it comes to transparency to users,
	but I considered that acceptable. After all, we have eBPF users all
	over the place in the kernel already, and seccomp, for instance,
	isn't any better in that regard.
</div>
<p>
Even so, he said, he would be willing to look again at a solution based on
netfilter, especially if Pablo were willing to help with the implementation
— something that Pablo said he could do.  BPF developer Alexei Starovoitov
was <a href="/Articles/698086/">rather less impressed</a>, suggesting that
a netfilter-based solution should be considered as a separate facility in
the future, if a way can be found to implement it without slowing things
down too much.
<p>
And that is where the discussion stands as of this writing.  In a sense,
netfilter and BPF were always destined to come into conflict at some point;
both are, in essence, mechanisms for loading packet-filtering policy into
the kernel.  Even if this particular disagreement is solved without undue
drama, this question is likely to come up again in other contexts.  Thus
far, there seem to be few bounds on places where BPF may be applicable
but, perhaps, it still isn't the solution to every policy problem that
comes along.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Isn't that what nftables was supposed to do?<br>
<p>
I see that nftables uses its own VM rather than eBPF, but the main objection to just using eBPF seemed to be simply that with eBPF you can only replace the entire program, not individual rules. It appears to me that this could be handled by treating the nftables VM as an intermediate language and employing a user-mode helper program to compile the rules down to eBPF whenever they change.<br>
<p>
The same mechanism would presumably integrate well with this new infrastructure to attach an eBPF filter to a control group.<br>

Regarding "Control groups (cgroups) perform two basic functions in the kernel: they allow the hierarchical grouping of processes, and they enable the use of controllers to apply resource limits to the processes in each group.":<br>
<p>
I want to add in this context that cgroups are used also for accounting for usage of resources, which is also an important part of their role.<br>

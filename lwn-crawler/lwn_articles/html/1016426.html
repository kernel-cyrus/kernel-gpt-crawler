</div>
The <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html">kernel
samepage merging (KSM)</a> subsystem works by finding pages in memory with
the same contents, then replacing the duplicated copies with a single,
shared copy.  KSM can improve memory utilization in a system, but has some
problems as well.  In two memory-management-track sessions at the 2025
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, Mathieu
Desnoyers and Sourav Panda proposed improvements to KSM to
make it work better for specific use cases.
<p>
<h4>Supporting user-space text patching</h4>
<p>
Desnoyers has come to KSM to help with a seemingly unrelated problem that
he is working on: code patching for user-space processes.  He works with
instrumentation like the <a href="https://lttng.org/">LTTng tracing
framework</a>, which allows the placement of tracepoints within an
application.  In the current implementation, each tracepoint has a
controlling variable and a branch to determine whether the tracepoint
fires.  Some of his customers, he said, have applications with 30,000
tracepoints in them; at that scale, the extra overhead for each tracepoint
adds up.  He would like to improve this situation by using code patching,
as is done in the kernel now.  There are other use cases, including tuning
code for available features or selecting application features to enable,
that would benefit from code patching as well.
<p>
Since this is performance-oriented work, he is concerned about the code
patching creating new performance problems of its own.  Specifically, patching code
by writing to a text page will cause that page to be copied; code that was
once shared no longer is.  That will be the case even if all of the processes
sharing that page of text patch it in the same way.  KSM can perhaps help
to undo this duplication, but its page scanning brings overhead of its own,
which Desnoyers would like to avoid.
<p>
Another problem is that KSM is focused on deduplication on systems hosting
virtual machines.  It requires configuration by the system administrator to
work effectively, and brings security concerns.  He would rather have a
simpler solution that just works.
<p>
He had <a href="/Articles/1014220/#ksm">proposed such a solution</a> prior
to the Summit, but had been told by Linus Torvalds that there is not room
in the kernel for two implementations of KSM.  He is not looking to replace
the current KSM implementation, so that has led him to start thinking about
other approaches.
<p>
One possibility, he said, would be to add the concept of per-user file
overlays.  The kernel's <a href="/Articles/499190/">uprobes</a> mechanism
can patch a running process now, but it changes all processes in the system
that are running the targeted code, while he would like to limit the
effects to a single process.  So he is thinking he could add a new system
call for code patching that would create a new overlay, tracking each
user's changes to a given binary.  It would apply on top of the files an
application uses, and changes would apply immediately to all processes
(owned by that user) that are running the affected program.  The downside
of this approach, he said, is that it would make it hard to instrument
different parts of a process hierarchy differently.
<p>
So a better solution might be to create a <tt>text_poke()</tt> system call
that would be provided a vector of instructions to patch.  The kernel would
track the altered pages for each address space (mapped file) at several
levels — altered pages can be further altered later on.  Whenever a process
modifies one of its pages in this way, the kernel would attempt to find
other altered copies of the same page and, if it finds one containing the
same alterations, the two users would share the page.  The altered pages
would be cached even if all users exit, meaning that the patched pages
would persist for short-lived applications that will want them again in the
future; they could be reclaimed as needed when memory gets tight.
<p>
It is fair to say that this idea did not evoke a great deal of enthusiasm
in the room.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox asked if Desnoyers was familiar with the "reflink" concept,
which he described as a sort of copy-on-write hard link for files.  There
have been <a href="/Kernel/Index/#reflink">efforts over the years</a> to
create a generalized reflink capability for Linux without success, but some
filesystems implement that functionality internally.  Wilcox suggested that
code patching could act like reflink under the covers without exposing the
changed files to user space.  When code is patched, he said, a new inode
could be created for the altered file and stored in the associated virtual
memory area.
<p>
The hard part, he said, is that the kernel does not have an efficient way
to cache reflinked files.  Also, the same (unchanged) page in two reflinked
files will be stored as separate pages in the page cache; fixing that has
been on the wishlist for years.  Desnoyers asked how it might be possible
for the kernel to map a list of modifications to the correct inode; Wilcox
pondered for a moment, then answered: "<q>Oh well, it was a nice idea</q>".
<p>
David Hildenbrand, though, expressed interest in pursuing the reflink idea
further.  What is needed, he said, is a high-level description of the
changes to be made.  The kernel can then generate a new file from that list
on demand, and reclaim it when needed.  The idea sounds easy and clean, he
said, "<q>except it won't be easy</q>".  The session concluded with Wilcox
saying that it was an interesting problem.
<p>

<h4>Selective KSM</h4>
<p>
In the following session, Panda briefly presented two proposals to address
some of the problems with KSM.  The feature is useful, he started, but it
requires a lot of adjusting of parameters to work well, adds run-time
overhead for the page scanning, and has been seen as a security problem as
well.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016429/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/SouravPanda-sm.png" alt="[Sourav Panda]"
title="Sourav Panda" class="rthumb"></a>

The first idea is "synchronous KSM", where the merging of pages would be
directed synchronously by user space.  The merging of pages would only
happen when requested (and the time taken would be charged to the process
requesting it), and only the specific memory areas indicated would be
considered for merging.  The actual request could be made by way of sysfs, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>,
or some other system call.  Security would be improved, since the
caller has control over which pages are considered for merging, and CPU
efficiency would be improved over the background scan that KSM currently
uses.  The biggest limitation would be that, once two pages diverge from
each other, they will stay separate, even if they come to have the same
contents in the future.
<p>
The second proposal is "partitioned KSM", where processes would be divided
into sensitive and non-sensitive partitions.  This partitioning would be
controlled via a sysfs hierarchy; new partitions can be created as needed.
Merging would be controlled by writing a process ID and an address range to
a partition's control file; the kernel would add the process to the
partition, then synchronously scan the given address range for merge
candidates.  Hildenbrand said that this idea is similar to using
<tt>madvise(MADV_MERGEABLE)</tt> to control merging, except that it acts
synchronously.  He suggested using <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_madvise.2.html"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>
rather than sysfs to control this feature.
<p>
An alternative, Panda said, would be to create a new <tt>ksm_open()</tt>
system call that would accept the name of a partition to join and return a
file descriptor representing that partition.  There would be a
<tt>ksm_merge()</tt> to request the merging of duplicate pages within that
partition.  Other system calls would be added to undo the merging of pages
or detach from the partition entirely.
Hildenbrand said that dropping the current KSM implementation
is not an option, so a mechanism that simply adds partitions is potentially
interesting.
<p>
As the session (and the day) came to an end, Panda asked whether any such
feature should be configurable at compile time; Michal Hocko advised
against that, since KSM is already an opt-in feature.  He said that he
likes the file-descriptor idea, which provides a clear namespace for KSM
operations.  Hildenbrand said that the global KSM functionality could
remain too, it would just have to be carefully disabled for any process
that joins a partition.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Minor correction: reflink is always implemented by individual filesystems. What I was talking about was sharing the page cache between reflinked files. It's been discussed many times over the years, with no generic solution yet. erofs implements it internally.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 29, 2014</br>
           </div>
Buffer overflows have long been a source of serious bugs and security
problems at all levels of the software stack.  Much work has been done over
the years to eliminate unsafe 
library functions, add stack-integrity checking and more, but buffer
overflow bugs still happen with great regularity.  A recently posted kernel
patch is one of the final steps toward the availability of a new tool that
should help to make buffer overflow problems more uncommon: Intel's
upcoming "MPX" hardware feature.
<p>
MPX is, at its core, a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds
checking on pointer accesses.  The hardware, following direction from
software, maintains 
a table of pointers in use and the range of accessible memory (the
"bounds") associated with each.  Whenever a pointer is dereferenced,
special instructions can be used to ensure that the program is accessing
memory within the range specified for that particular pointer.  These
instructions are meant to be fast, allowing bounds checking to be performed
on production systems with a minimal performance impact.
<p>
As one might expect, quite a bit of supporting software work is needed to
make this feature work, since the hardware cannot, on its own, have any
idea of what the proper bounds for any given pointer would be.  The first
step in this direction is to add support to the GCC compiler.  <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler">Support
for MPX in GCC</a> is well advanced, and should be considered for merging
into the repository trunk sometime in the near future.
<p>
When a file is compiled with the new <tt>-fmpx</tt> flag, GCC will generate
code to make use of the MPX feature.  That involves tracking every pointer
created by the program and the associated bounds; any time that a new
pointer is created, it must be inserted into the bounds table for
checking.  Tracking of bounds must follow casts and pointer arithmetic;
there is also a mechanism for "narrowing" a set of bounds when a pointer to
an object within another object (a specific structure field, say) is
created.  The function-call interface is changed so that when a pointer is
passed to a 
function, the appropriate bounds are passed with it.  Pointers returned
from functions also carry bounds information.  
<p>
With that infrastructure in place, it becomes possible to protect a program
against out-of-bounds memory accesses.  To that end, whenever a pointer is
dereferenced, the appropriate instructions are generated to perform a
bounds check first.  See <a
href="/Articles/582739/">Documentation/x86/intel_mpx.txt</a>, included with
the  kernel patch set (described below), for details on how code generation
changes.  In brief: the new <tt>bndcl</tt> and <tt>bndcu</tt> instructions
check a pointer reference against the lower and upper limits, respectively.
If those instructions succeed, the pointer is known to be within the
allowed range.

<p>
The next step is to prepare the C library for bounds checking.  At a
minimum, that means building the library with <tt>-fmpx</tt>, but there is
more to it than that.  Any library function that creates an object
(<tt>malloc()</tt>, say) needs to return the proper bounds along with the
pointer to the object itself.  In the end, the C library will be the source
for a large portion of the bounds information used within an application.
The bulk of the work for the GNU C library (glibc) is evidently done and
committed to the glibc git repository.  Instrumentation of other libraries
would also be desirable, of course, but the C library is the obvious
starting point.
<p>
Then there is the matter of getting the necessary support code into the
kernel; Qiaowei Ren has recently posted <a href="/Articles/582473/">a patch
set</a> to do just that.  Part of the patch set is necessarily management
overhead: allowing applications to set up bounds tables, removing bounds
tables when the memory they refer to is unmapped, and so on.  But much of
the work is oriented around the user-space interface to the MPX feature.
<p>
The first step is to add two new <tt>prctl()</tt> options:
<tt>PR_MPX_INIT</tt> and <tt>PR_MPX_RELEASE</tt>.  The first of those sets
up MPX checking and turns on the feature, while the second cleans
everything up.  Applications can thus explicitly control pointer bounds
checking, but that is not expected.  Instead, the system runtime will
probably turn on MPX as part of application startup, before the application
itself begins to run.  Current discussion on the linux-kernel list suggests
that it may be possible to do the entire setup and teardown job within the
user-space runtime code, making these <tt>prctl()</tt> calls unnecessary,
so they may not actually find their way into the mainline kernel.
<p>
When a bounds violation is detected, the processor will trap into the
kernel.  The kernel, in turn, will turn the trap into a <tt>SIGSEGV</tt>
signal to be delivered to the application, similar to other types of memory
access errors.  Applications that look at the <tt>siginfo</tt> structure
passed to the signal handler from the kernel will be able to recognize a
bounds error by checking 
the <tt>si_code</tt> field for the new <tt>SEGV_BNDERR</tt> value.  The
offending address will be stored in <tt>si_addr</tt>, while the bounds in
effect at the time of the trap will be stored in <tt>si_lower</tt> and
<tt>si_upper</tt>.  But most programs, of course, will not handle
<tt>SIGSEGV</tt> at all and will simply crash in this situation.
<p>
In summary, there is a fair amount of development work needed to make this
hardware feature available to user applications.  The good news is that,
for the most part, this work appears to be done.  Using MPX within the
kernel itself should also be entirely possible, but no patches to that
effect have been posted so far.  Adding bounds checking to the kernel
without breaking things is likely to present a number of interesting
challenges; for example, narrowing would have to be reversed
anytime the <tt>container_of()</tt> macro is used — and there are thousands
of <tt>container_of()</tt> calls in the kernel.  Finding ways to instrument
the kernel would thus be tricky;  doing this instrumentation in a way
that does 
not make a mess out of the kernel source could be even harder.  But there
would be clear benefits should somebody manage to get the job done.
<p>
Meanwhile, though, anybody looking forward to MPX will have to wait for a
couple of things: hardware that actually supports the feature and
distributions built to use it.  MPX is evidently a part of Intel's
"Skylake" architecture, which is not expected to be commercially available
before 2015 at the earliest.  So there will be a bit of a wait before this
feature is widely available.  But, by the time it happens, Linux should be
ready to take advantage of it.

what's the performance impact of this going to be? it seems that just passing the pointerID along with the pointer value is going to cause enough data bloat to blow out caches and cause a very significant performance hit in many cases (even assuming that the CPU has a table large enough to hold every pointer in the system and the bounds and can check this without any overhead)<br>

Is this information something that a tool like valgrind could hook into now? Valgrind is already extremely useful but if there is more/richer info that the compiler can emit then it can spot even more problem. Obviously this is mostly useful for debugging, but still useful.<br>

Interestingly, they've thought of a way to do this while detecting non-MPXed-up ("legacy", heh) code and leaving its ABI unchanged. This was the biggest stumbling-block to using most past bounded-pointer implementations and tended to be why they never made any headway and generally got removed. (GCC and glibc have had, what, two bounded pointer implementations by now, each added with great effort, bitrotted over years, then finally removed?)

Not sure if one of the implementations you referred to was "Bounds Checking GCC" which I wrote a long long time ago, but anyway it allowed you to mix checked and unchecked code.  That was, in fact, a pretty essential feature since it ran on SunOS and you couldn't recompile libc from source ... because you didn't have the source!<br>

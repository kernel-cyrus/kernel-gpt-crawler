<div class="ArticleText">
Any C coder worth his or her salt knows that encoding text into a string
with <tt>sprintf()</tt> invites buffer overflows, and is thus dangerous.
The proper way of doing things is with <tt>snprintf()</tt>, which takes the
length of the destination string as a parameter, and will not overrun it.
Callers to <tt>snprintf()</tt> generally assume that the return value is
the length of what was actually encoded into the destination array.  That
turns out, however, to not be the case.  As per the C99 standard,
<tt>snprintf()</tt> returns the length the resulting string <i>would</i>
be, assuming it all fit into the destination array.  As a result of this
misunderstanding, the kernel is full of <tt>snprintf()</tt> calls which use
the return value incorrectly.
<p>
This mistake is rarely a problem; <tt>snprintf()</tt> almost never has to
truncate its output, so the return value is what the programmer is
expecting.  Every miscoded use is an invitation for trouble, however, and
really should be fixed.  To that end, the <a
href="/Articles/69348/">2.6.2-rc3-mm1</a> tree contains a patch by Juergen
Quade which adds a couple of new functions:
<p>
<pre>
    int scnprintf(char *buf, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
    int vscnprintf(char *buf, size_t size, const char *format, va_list args);
</pre>
<p>
The new functions work the way many programmers expected the old ones to:
they return the length of the string actually created in <tt>buf</tt>.  The
plan is to migrate the kernel over to the new functions; the patch fixes
well over 200 <tt>snprintf()</tt> and <tt>vsnprint()</tt> calls.  Unless
the old functions are eventually removed, however, they are likely to be a
source of programming errors well into the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Another approach is to calculate the maximum length of the resulting<br>string.  This may be difficult if there are strings or variable formats.<br>If there are strings you can use the precision specifier to limit the<br>length of those strings.  If it is not possible to staticly determine the<br>maximum length or it is too large to allocate every time you can do<br>dynamic determination of the length by testing the lengths of the strings<br>or of the dynamic formats.

      To calculate the right buffer size, you should use code which stays tied <br>to the format and conversion code. Like, for example, &quot;snprintf(NULL, 0, <br>format, ...)&quot;; the kernel version of vsnprintf actually obeys a zero size <br>and doesn't dereference the buffer. It would actually be a neat trick to <br>detect this case and handle it, if possible, at compile time. That way, <br>people could get the compiler to size their buffers correctly <br>automatically. <br>

      Utterly impossible to size at compile time -- the length of what is
added to the buffer varies with runtime data.  Something as simple
as <tt>snprintf(buf, 999, "%d", random());</tt>
could put 1 to 10 digits in buf.

      I think the convention that sprintf returns the number of bytes written (rather than &quot;would be written&quot;) does not make a real lot of sense: you never know whether your buffer is large enough, so there is no way to inform the user that something is truncated.  And even if you guess it is not (because buffer size == return value), you have no way to allocate the required memory size.  Given that most programmers won't even use snprintf, I think that educating those who are already better off should be easy: all they need is to use the min of the returned value and the buffer size if they want the scnprintf semantics.

      Historically, there have been two variants of snprintf,
with the ISO C99 standard, taken from BSD, of returning
the length of the entire formatted string, even if it
didn't entirely fit.
<p>
Earlier versions of snprintf only returned a count of how
many non-nul characters went into the buffer.
<p>
This earlier return convention was actually "obvious" at
the time -- no one on those slow, old machines would expect
a C library routine to be wasting its CPU cycles calculating
the length of some formatted output that it wasn't going to
output.
<p>
And my impression is that most of us old timers are surprised
by the new convention.
<p>
This new convention is also not worth much in most kernel code,
which doesn't do anything with the extra information anyway.
If the intended output doesn't fit (it's usually a console
print or something) then tough - it gets truncated. Not usually
worth the bother to try to expand the buffer size (and you have
to be careful, not to open the kernel up to a Denial of Service
attack, if the user can somehow persuade it to attempt to print
something that's surprisingly long.
<p>
Still, Linus has clearly chosen the new ISO C99 standard (someone
backed the lib/vsprintf.c code off to the "old standard", and
Linus restored the C99 conventions.

</i>
<p>
I doubt the wasted computation entered into the decision.  The reason the old behavior was obvious at the time is that the function is emulating printf(), which like all Unix I/O routines, returns the number of characters transferred.
<p>
The modern sprintf return value, though useful, is actually quite unconventional.

Hmmmm ... I feel we are both guessing slightly off.  You're likely
right it wasn't an explicit decision to save cpu cycles.  But the
analogy with printf is fragile as well - it's not like printf has
a choice of two possible lengths to choose from.  It writes whatever
it has format for, and counts it all (or SEGV's trying).
<p>
Your last words:<ul><i>is actually quite unconventional</i></ul> might
come closest to the mark.  Something about the modern value just
seems odd.  The early snprintf creators perhaps didn't even consider
that choice of return value as an alternative.

      <p><i>it's not like printf has a choice of two possible lengths to choose from. It writes whatever it has format for, and counts it all (or SEGV's trying).</i>

<p>OK, I see in the printf case, a partial write isn't practical.  But it doesn't really weaken the argument that printf is an I/O routine, and so it is natural to follow the pattern of write() and fwrite() and return the number of bytes written.
<p>
The leap from there to snprintf() is a lot more obvious when you include the sprintf() step.  sprintf(), derived from printf(), quite naturally returns the number of characters formatted, just like printf().  And it's a very useful value, too.  snprintf() was derived from sprintf(), and merely adds a constraint on the length; If you're going to drop it in to replace a dangerous sprintf(), you clearly want it to do the same as sprintf() and return the number of characters formatted.

      Pre-calculating the length of the resulting string, as suggested<br>above, doesn't cut it.<p>(1) It requires adding error prone code to pre-walk the result,<br>    duplicating the choice of what to print.  Soon the pre-walk<br>    code and the actual format will get out of sync again.<br>(2) Sometimes you are printing variable stuff, that is changing as<br>    you print it (on a multiprocessor).  So you don't know the<br>    length until you know it.<br>(3) Sometimes you are printing several items into a buffer, while<br>    walking a list or something.  You can't afford to walk the list<br>    twice, and besides - see (2) above.<br>(4) The idea of a buffer limited routine like snprintf is to help<br>    the user avoid disastrous mistakes that only blow up rarely.<br>    Given all the difficulties (listed above) in getting the 'right'<br>    answer as to the resulting length, you _still_ need a buffer<br>    limited routine, because you still risk running off the end.<br>

      The biggest problem that this snprintf patch will fix is not noted
in the article above.
<p>
There were a couple hundred places in the kernel that would loop:
<ul>
  len += snprintf (buf+len, buflen-len, "...", ...);
</ul>
accumulating the number of non-nul chars written into a buffer in 'len'.
Well, actually, unbeknownst to the coder, accumulating the <u>total</u>
number of characters that could have been written, if the buffer were
big enough.
<p>
The 2nd snprintf parameter (buflen-len, here) would go negative,
when the total number of chars that could have been written into
the buffer exceeded the buffer length.
<p>
Since this 2nd parameter is passed as a type size_t (unsigned),
this meant that the next call to snprintf claimed that the available
buffer size was **huge**.  A license to overrun buffers.  Not something
you desire in your average kernel.
<p>
The patch going in will have any buffer size that is huge (high bit
set) be special cased as if it was zero, putting nothing more in the
buffer.

      Hmm, seems like a better approach might be to track down such uses of <tt>snprintf()</tt> and replace them with something like:
<pre>
if ((len += snprintf (buf+len, buflen-len, "...", ...)) > buflen) {
        optionally deal with the error;
        len = buflen;
}
</pre>
The branch shouldn't cost more than the call to <tt>snprintf</tt> (unless it's inlined and extremely efficient), and you get to deal with error conditions, making it better than the old snprintf behavior.<p>

Of course, this takes time (janitors?), but aside from that, I'm not sure I see why this snprintf behavior is a problem...

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 14, 2012</br>
           </div>
The kernel's behavior on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems is, by
most accounts, suboptimal; processes tend to get separated from their
memory, leading to lots of cross-node traffic and poor performance.  Until
now, the work to improve this situation has been a story of two competing
patch sets; it recently <a href="/Articles/522093/">appeared</a> that one
of them may be set to be merged as the result of decisions made outside of the
community's view.  But nothing in memory management is ever simple, so it
should be unsurprising that the NUMA scheduling discussion has become more
complicated.
<p>

On November 6, memory management hacker Mel Gorman, who had not contributed
code of his own toward NUMA scheduling so far, posted a new patch series
called "<a 
href="/Articles/523065/">Foundation for automatic NUMA balancing</a>," or
"balancenuma" for short.  He pointed out that there were objections to both
of the existing approaches to NUMA scheduling and that it was proving hard
to merge the best from each.  So his objective was to add enough
infrastructure to the memory management subsystem to make it easy to
experiment with different NUMA placement policies.  He also implemented a
placeholder policy of his own:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The actual policy it implements is a very stupid greedy policy
	called "Migrate On Reference Of pte_numa Node (MORON)".  While
	stupid, it can be faster than the vanilla kernel and the
	expectation is that any clever policy should be able to beat MORON.
</div>
<p>
In short, the MORON policy works by instantly migrating pages whenever a
cross-node reference is detected using the NUMA hinting mechanism.  Mel's
<a href="/Articles/524667/">second version</a>, posted one week later,
fixes a number of problems, adds the "home node" concept (that tries to
keep processes and their memory on a single "home" NUMA node), and adds
some statistics gathering to implement a "CPU follows memory" policy that
can move a process to a new home node if it appears that better memory locality
would result.  
<p>

Andrea Arcangeli, author of the AutoNUMA approach, <a
href="/Articles/524999/">said that balancenuma "looks OK"</a> and that
AutoNUMA could be built on top of it.  Ingo Molnar, instead, was less
accepting, <a href="/Articles/525000/">saying</a> "<q>I've picked up a
number of cleanups from your series and propagated them into tip:numa/core
tree.</q>"  He later added <a href="/Articles/525001/">a request</a>
that Mel rebase his work on top of the numa/core tree.  He clearly did not
see the patch set as a "foundation" on which to build.  A new numa/core
patch set was <a href="/Articles/524718/">posted</a> on November&nbsp;13.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra, meanwhile, has posted an "<a
href="/Articles/524535/">enhanced NUMA scheduling with adaptive
affinity</a>" patch set.  This one does away with the "home node" concept
altogether; instead, it looks at memory access patterns to determine where
a process's memory lives and who that memory might be shared with.  Based
on that information, the CPU affinity mechanism is used to move processes
to the appropriate nodes.  Peter says:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Note that this adaptive NUMA affinity mechanism integrated into the
	scheduler is essentially free of heuristics - only the access
	patterns determine which tasks are related and grouped. As a result
	this adaptive affinity code is able to move both threads and
	processes close(r) to each other if they are related - and let them
	spread if they are not.
</div>
<p>
This patch set has not gotten a lot of review comments, and it does not
appear to have been folded into the numa/core series as of this writing.
<p>

<h4>What will happen in 3.8?</h4>
<p>
The numa/core approach remains in linux-next, which is intended
to be the final stage for code that is intended to be merged.  And, indeed,
Ingo has <a href="/Articles/525002/">reiterated</a> that he plans to merge
this code for the 3.8 cycle, saying "<q>numa/core sums up the consensus
so far</q>".  The use of that language might rightly raise some
eyebrows; when there are between two and four competing patch sets
(depending on how one counts) aimed at the same
problem, the term "consensus" does not usually come to mind.  And, indeed,
it seems that this consensus does not yet exist.
<p>
Andrew Morton has been overtly grumpy; the existence of numa/core in
linux-next has made the management of his tree (which is based on
linux-next) difficult — his tree needs to be ready for the 3.8 merge window
where, <a href="/Articles/525004/">he thinks</a>, numa/core should not be
under consideration:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	And yes, I'm assuming you're not targeting 3.8.  Given the history
	behind this and the number of people who are looking at it, that's
	too hasty...  And I must say that I deeply regret not digging my
	heels in when this went into -next all those months ago.  It has
	caused a ton of trouble for me and for a lot of other people.
</div>
<p>
Hugh Dickins, a developer who is not normally associated with this sort of
discussion, <a href="/Articles/525006/">chimed in</a> as well:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	People are still reviewing and comparing competing solutions.
	Maybe this latest will prove to be closest to the right answer,
	maybe it will not.  It's, what, about two days old right now?
<p>
	If we had wanted to push in a good solution a little prematurely,
	we would surely have chosen Andrea's AutoNUMA months ago, despite
	efforts to block it; and maybe we shall still want to go that way.
<p>
	Please, forget about v3.8, cut this branch out of linux-next, and
	seek consensus around getting it right for v3.9.
</div>
<p>
Rik van Riel <a href="/Articles/525007/">agreed</a>, saying "<q>Having
unreviewed (some of it NAKed) code sitting in tip.git and you trying to
force it upstream is not the right way to go.</q>"  He also suggested
that, if anything should be considered for merging in 3.8, it would be
Mel's foundation patches.
<p>
And that is where the discussion stands as of this writing.  There is a lot
of uncertainty about what might happen with NUMA scheduling in 3.8, meaning
that, most likely, nothing will happen at all.  It is highly unlikely that
Linus would merge the numa/core set in the face of the above complaints;
he would be far more likely to sit back and tell the developers involved to
work out something they can all agree with.  So this is a discussion that
might go on for a while yet.
<p>
Making changes to the memory management subsystem is a famously hard thing
to do, especially when the changes are as large as those being considered
here.  But there is another factor that is complicating this particular
situation.  As the term "NUMA scheduling" suggests, this is not just a
memory management problem.  The path to improved NUMA performance will
require coordinated changes to — and greater integration between — the
memory management subsystem and the CPU scheduler.  It's telling that the
developers on one side of this divide are primarily associated with
scheduler development, while those on the other side are mostly memory
management folks.  Each camp is, in a sense, invading the other's turf in
an attempt to create a comprehensive solution to the problem; it is not
surprising that some disagreements have emerged.
<p>

Also implicit in this situation is that Linus is unlikely to attempt to
resolve the disagreement by decree.  There are too many developers and too
many interrelated core subsystems involved.  So some sort of rough
consensus will have to be found.  Your editor's explicitly unreliable
prediction is that little NUMA-related work will be merged in the 3.8
development cycle.  Under pressure from several directions, the developers
involved will figure out how to resolve their biggest differences in the
next few months.  The resulting code will likely be at least partially
merged for 3.9 — later than many would wish, but the end result is likely
to be better than would be seen with a patch set rushed into 3.8.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

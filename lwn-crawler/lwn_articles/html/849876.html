           <p>March 25, 2021</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Vlastimil Babka</p>
           </div>
<a href="/Articles/849638/">Part 1</a> of this series described the
copy-on-write (COW) mechanism used to avoid unnecessary copying of pages in
memory, then went into the details of a bug in that mechanism that
could result in the disclosure of sensitive data.  A patch written by Linus
Torvalds and merged for the 5.8 kernel appeared to fix that problem without
unfortunate side effects elsewhere in the system.  But COW is a complicated
beast and surprises are not uncommon; this particular story was nowhere
near as close to an end as had been thought.
<p>

Torvalds's expectations quickly turned out to be overly optimistic. In
August 2020, a bug was <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200808223802.11451-1-peterx@redhat.com/">reported
by Peter Xu</a>; it affected <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>,
which is a subsystem for handling page faults in a user-space process.
This mechanism allows the handling process to (among other things) <a
href="/Articles/787308/">write-protect ranges of memory</a> and be notified
of attempts to write to that range.  One use case for this feature is to
prevent pages from being modified while the monitoring process writes their
contents to secondary storage.  That write can, however, result in a
read-only <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> (GUP) call on the write-protected
pages, which should be fine.  Remember, though, that Torvalds's fix worked
by changing read-only <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> calls to look like calls
for write access; this was done to force the breaking of COW references on
the pages in question.  In the <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> case, that generates
an unexpected write 
fault in the monitoring process, with the result that this process hangs.


<p>

The <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200811183950.10603-1-peterx@redhat.com/">initial
version of Xu's fix</a> went in the direction of more fine-grained rules
for breaking COW by GUP, as had been anticipated in the original fix, and
added some <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>-specific handling. But during the
discussion, Torvalds instead <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wit7LDr0tA2eVn7yHHEH76oK=Lfm3tTs8_JxO8XEED4_g@mail.gmail.com/">proposed
a completely different approach</a>, which resulted in <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200821234958.7896-1-peterx@redhat.com/">another
patch set</a> from Xu.

These patches essentially revert Torvalds's change and abandon the approach
of always breaking COW for GUP calls. Instead, <tt>do_wp_page()</tt>, which handles
write faults to a write-protected page, is modified by <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/09854ba94c6a">commit 09854ba94c6a</a>
("mm: do_wp_page() simplification") to more strictly check if the page is
shared by multiple processes.
<p>

With that commit in place, writes to a page
without breaking COW are only allowed if the page is mapped by a single
process and its reference count is not otherwise elevated (such as by an
outstanding GUP). In the original <tt>vmsplice()</tt> PoC, the result is
that the child process calling <tt>vmsplice()</tt> is again able to get the
reference to the page shared with the parent, and retain the reference
after unmapping the page from its own page tables. However, as soon as the
parent tries to write to the page, the page-fault handler notices its
elevated reference count and decides to break COW, giving the
parent a new copy that the child cannot access. The idea and
implementation is also simpler and should have performance
benefits thanks to reduced page locking, as Torvalds <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=whXyMiXLujhPdfQN3q5n-DpbVRFZfJqjBYLTYw37uSMvA@mail.gmail.com/">expected</a>
and the Intel testing bot later <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200914024321.GG26874@shao2-debian/">confirmed</a>.

<p>

Another bug was <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/alpine.LRH.2.02.2009031328040.6929@file01.intranet.prod.int.rdu2.redhat.com/">reported</a>
in September by Mikulas Patocka, who observed that running <tt>strace</tt>
on a DAX filesystem (a filesystem providing direct access to the persistent
memory on which it is stored) triggers a kernel warning and kills the
traced process. That bug was apparently not fully analyzed for the root
cause, but <tt>git&nbsp;bisect</tt> pointed to the same COW fix, and the
patches intended to fix the <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> bug also fixed the
strace bug.


<h4>Trouble with RDMA</h4>
<p>
At the time, apparently only Hugh Dickins was <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/alpine.LSU.2.11.2008312207450.1212@eggly.anvils/">concerned</a>
about relying on the elevated reference count for this decision. He cited
several examples 
where this kind of approach had created problems in the 2.6 days. His worries
went unanswered, though, and the patch set was merged by Torvalds few days
later; it was released in Linux 5.9-rc5. But Dickins's worries turned out to be
justified;
Jason Gunthorpe <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200914143829.GA1424636@nvidia.com/#t">reported</a>
just one day later that the new approach broke the RDMA 
self-tests.

<p>

<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200917200638.GM8409@ziepe.ca/">The
problem this time</a> appears to be that the RDMA self-test creates an
anonymous private mapping and then calls a special form of GUP called <a
href="/Articles/807108/"><tt>pin_user_pages()</tt></a> which is, broadly
speaking, a kernel interface allowing drivers (such as RDMA) to ensure that
pages do not go away from under them while they perform data transfers to
or from those pages.  Then the self-test calls <tt>fork()</tt> to spawn a
short-lived child.  The child process does not actually touch the pages
but, due to the <tt>fork()</tt> call, the page-table entries become
write-protected for COW, and remain write-protected after the child
exits. Further writes from the parent process to the pages are expected to
modify the pages pinned for the RDMA operations. But, due to the elevated
reference count, the writes result in an "unexpected" COW break, even if
the process is the only one mapping the pages — a direct result of commit
09854ba94c6a.

 <p>

Note that it would be possible to fix this test by calling
<tt>madvise(MADV_DONTFORK)</tt> on the mapping submitted to RDMA, which
would prevent that mapping from being included in the child's address
space. That change would make the test more robust, because relying on the
child process to exit quickly enough might be unreliable and lead to
unexpected COW breaks even before commit 09854ba94c6a. However, there might
be other programs that use RDMA and do not call
<tt>madvise(MADV_DONTFORK)</tt> before <tt>fork()</tt>; even if these
programs might not be fully robust, it would not be acceptable to break
them with a kernel change. Also, as Gunthorpe <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200917200638.GM8409@ziepe.ca">noted</a>,
it is not easy to fix every RDMA (or page-pinning in general) user, even
when one wants to.  <p>


The 5.9 kernel was late in the release-candidate phase at this point, so an
urgent fix was needed; it eventually appeared in the form of <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20200925222600.6832-1-peterx@redhat.com/">yet
another patch set</a> from Xu.  There was no fundamental change of
approach this time. During a <tt>fork()</tt> call, if any pinned pages are
encountered, the child will get a copy immediately instead of sharing a COW
page with the parent. The test for a page being pinned is not exact
and may have false-positive results if the page has a significantly
increased reference count 
for other reasons, but copying a few more pages during <tt>fork()</tt> than
is strictly needed should not hurt performance. To minimize the increased
<tt>fork()</tt> overhead,
a preparatory patch caused the <tt>pin_user_pages()</tt>
call to mark the process with a flag indicating that the
process has pinned some pages at some point; that allows the newly added
checks for pinned pages to be skipped for all processes that do not call
<tt>pin_user_pages()</tt> before <tt>fork()</tt>, which should be the
majority of them.
<p>

With some minor follow-up fixes, the final 5.9 kernel was
released in October with the RDMA issue addressed. <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/0-v4-908497cf359a+4782-gup_fork_jgg@nvidia.com/">More
followup work</a> was done to address a theoretical case where the parent
process would perform page pinning in parallel with a <tt>fork()</tt> call;
those patches were eventually merged for 5.11-rc1.

<h4>An unwanted holiday present</h4>
<p>
That should have concluded our saga.  Shortly before Christmas, though,
Nadav Amit <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20201219043006.2206347-1-namit@vmware.com/">reported</a>
a <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> self-test failure that was eventually <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/X98fZOiLNmnDQKhN@google.com/">linked</a>
by Yu Zhao to commit 09854ba94c6a. Again, a write-protected page (created
by a <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> operation) was being copied due to its elevated
reference count, this time leaving another CPU with a stale TLB entry
pointing to the original page.  The rather complicated full scenario is
described in the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210304095423.3825684-1-namit@vmware.com/">latest
version of the fix</a>, which notes that the missing TLB flush is actually
an old bug, but the more aggressive COW breaking of commit 09854ba94c6a
made it visible.
<p>

A similar problem was <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/X+D0hTZCrWS3P5Pi@google.com/">reported</a>
by Zhao for the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/soft-dirty.html">soft-dirty
mechanism</a>, which allows the monitoring (with low overhead but also low
granularity) of which pages a process has written to. This is done by
writing to the <tt>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</tt> file, which causes
all of the process's page-table entries to become write-protected. The
page-fault handler then, in response to write faults,  sets a soft-dirty bit
in the page-table entry; these bits can be read from
<tt>/proc/[pid]/pagemap</tt> to determine which pages were written to since
the <tt>clear_refs</tt> operation.

<p>

Investigation of these bugs led to a long discussion during which even more
issues became apparent, and there was some disagreement about the best
approach to fix them.  As Zhao noted,
the core issue is a race between two actions within the kernel:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The page-fault handler copying pages (where it previously wouldn't
     have), and
<li> The associated page-table entries being modified by either
     <tt>change_pte_range()</tt>, which is used by 
     <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>, or <tt>clear_soft_dirty()</tt>, which handles writes to
     <tt>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</tt>.
</ul>
<p>

Both of the above actions happen under the <tt>mmap_lock</tt>, but that
lock is taken for reading, allowing the actions to proceed
concurrently. Torvalds <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wg_UBuo7ro1fpEGkMyFKA1+PxrE85f9J_AhUfr-nJPpLQ@mail.gmail.com/">argued</a>
that these write-protecting operations should thus simply take the
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> for writing. Andrea Arcangeli was, however, <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/X+Ko1E808VVFx0+C@redhat.com/">unhappy</a>
about the solution, citing the absence of write locking as one of the advantages of
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> over <tt>mprotect()</tt>.

<p> Arcangeli proposed <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210107200402.31095-1-aarcange@redhat.com/">a
different fix</a> for the <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> issue; it was more
complicated, but avoided taking the <tt>mmap_lock</tt> for
writing. However, in the cover letter, he also argued that the
page-reference-count-based test for breaking COW was still problematic and
that the issues being fixed were just "the tip of the iceberg", with more
breakage to be expected. Thus, he said, it would be best if all commits
merged so far to fix the original <tt>vmsplice()</tt> vulnerability were
reverted, and <tt>vmsplice()</tt> should become a privileged operation
until specifically fixed.  He also echoed Hugh's earlier worries about
the approach of breaking COW depending solely on the elevated reference
count, and said that, if there were issues with the "GUP causes COW break"
approach of commit 17839856fd58, they should have been fixed instead. As a
result, he self-NAKed his own <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> fix.


<p>

Torvalds, however, <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wirQT8Sc8ZJwLqUfet1GTokyc0L0Vt+Y_b0mS++KbX36g@mail.gmail.com/">was
not convinced</a>; he noted that both approaches tried so far have corner
cases, but the current one is conceptually much simpler for the core
memory-management subsystem.  He said that it would be better to stick to
that one and deal with the exotic corner cases.  Arcangeli then <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/X%2FjgLGPgPb+Xms1t@redhat.com/">highlighted</a>
one concrete example of his worries by stating that the <tt>vmsplice()</tt>
vulnerability becomes reproducible again after commit 09854ba94c6a if the
PoC code is changed to use a transparent huge page (THP) instead of a base
(4096-byte) page.  He included the necessary patch for those who had access
to the
original reproducer, not aware that it was made public with the rest of the
Project Zero issue. The author has verified that the patched PoC indeed
reproduces the issue as of the 5.12-rc2 kernel.


<p>

Although the issue was acknowledged in subsequent discussion, it hasn't
been fixed yet. The problem is that, while the code handling write faults
on write-protected, base pages relies on the page's <i>reference</i>
count, 
the THP variant relies on <tt>page_trans_huge_mapcount()</tt> which is
equivalent to the page's <i>mapping</i> count. As explained earlier, the mapping
count is equal to one after the child process unmaps the page from its own
address space, even though the child retains access to the page through the
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> pipe. Gunthorpe <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210108181945.GF504133@ziepe.ca/">suggested</a>
that the GUP call performed by
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> should be adjusted to break COW immediately — an
approach that's again similar to the original fix in commit 17839856fd58,
but limited only to a class of long-term pins by GUP, including those
created by  <tt>vmsplice()</tt>.
So far, that idea doesn't seem to have
been implemented; even if it were, there might be other, less obvious ways
beside <tt>vmsplice()</tt> to exploit the underlying issue, although that
concern might be just theoretical.


 <p>

<h4>New rules</h4>
<p>
The last round of discussion so far (at least on the public mailing lists)
occurred around the middle of January 2021. Arcangeli again <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210110004435.26382-2-aarcange@redhat.com/">proposed</a>
to effectively restore the state before Linux 5.8 and deal with the
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> vulnerability in a different way. He <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210110004435.26382-1-aarcange@redhat.com/">included
a PoC</a> to demonstrate that, with the current page-reference-count-based
approach for breaking COW, data loss can happen. A process that performs an
<tt>O_DIRECT</tt> <tt>read()</tt> from a file to a buffer, while
simultaneously writing (by the CPU) to a different buffer within the same
page from another thread, might effectively lose the data being read if a
third thread (or a different process) writes to the
<tt>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</tt> file. That constitutes an ABI break
and, unlike the earlier TLB flush issues, is not fixed by taking
<tt>mmap_lock</tt> for writing. He also reiterated the unfixed
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> vulnerability with THPs.

<p>

Torvalds <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wj5=1DKbQut1-21EwQbMSghNL3KOSd82rNrBhuG9+eekA@mail.gmail.com/">replied</a>
that, instead of the revert, the <tt>clear_refs</tt> implementation should
be fixed and included a draft patch to that effect (he later merged this
patch into 5.11-rc4 as <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9348b73c2e1bf">commit
9348b73c2e1bf</a>). The idea is that, if a page appears to be pinned, the
<tt>clear_refs</tt> processing will simply not write-protect its page-table
entry, and thus, later, the write from a CPU will not cause a page fault
and COW break.  Users of the soft-dirty mechanism will see the page as
always dirty, which should be a fair result in the presence of DMA traffic
that is allowed to write to the page. Then he <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/CAHk-=wgi31FKc9AL6m87+pb2B79V2g_QjdhmtJNW8Pnq2ERQ-Q@mail.gmail.com/">expanded
upon</a> the general rules governing how to deal with pinning of pages for DMA
transfers and write-protecting. They can be summarized as:

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> When considering whether to just allow a write on a write-protected PTE,
     or to instead create a copy, and it is not certain that the process is the
     exclusive owner of the page, always create a copy. The elevated page
     reference count is an indication of not being an exclusive owner of
     the page.

<li> If the page is pinned with a cache-coherent GUP (such as for write DMA
     transfers) the page-table entry has to also be writable. It doesn't
     make sense to make it read-only if a DMA transfer can write to the
     page anyway.
</ul>
<p>

While these rules are conceptually simple, the devil is still in the
details. What if the DMA transfers are only meant for reading?  Gunthorpe
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210115183721.GG4605@ziepe.ca">mentioned</a>
a virtual-machine, live-migration scenario where the machine's memory is pinned
by RDMA and then <tt>clear_refs</tt> is used, presumably to detect which
pages have to be migrated again because their contents changed. If
<tt>clear_refs</tt> processing refuses to write-protect the pinned pages
and leaves them marked as dirty, this scheme becomes inefficient, as all of
the virtual machine's memory will appear to be dirty at all times.  And, unlike
<tt>clear_refs</tt>, <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> has not been patched at all, so
in combination with RDMA, unexpected COW breaks would occur instead.


 <p>

To fix these scenarios within the new COW rules, there might be better
heuristics possible for determining exclusive ownership than the
non-elevated page reference count or the PTE being writable. Similarly, the
test for whether a page is pinned can have false positives — the function
is called <tt>page_maybe_dma_pinned()</tt> after all. Several ideas were
floated, such as adding a new page flag or more precise counting of both
DMA pins and long-term pins, where the sub-counters would be carved out of
the bits used for the general reference count.  Neither idea would be easy
to implement, given how packed <tt>struct page</tt> already is and the
presence of <a href="/Articles/786044/">known attacks for elevating the
reference count</a> and thus risking a denial of service attack if the
limit on the reference count is reduced. But the 
discussion seems to have wound down without any concrete patches. The last
statement, in <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/b46a0eb9-f80f-e459-d31d-ed9074e38ede@redhat.com/">the
last message of the thread</a>, from David Hildenbrand, sums 
it up well: "<q>Complicated problem :)</q>"

<p>
<h4>Are we done yet?</h4>
<p>

So where are we now? In order to fix an information-leak vulnerability with
arguably limited potential for exploitation outside of Android, the 5.8
kernel was released with a major change to the COW mechanism. Due to the
reported bugs, another major change was done in the 5.9 kernel and is now
part of the 5.10&nbsp;LTS series. More bugs have been fixed in 5.11 and <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20210304095423.3825684-1-namit@vmware.com/">a
fix for the <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> TLB flushing issue</a> seems to be on the way.
However, some
scenarios for using RDMA with either the soft-dirty or <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>
mechanism may now be broken.

<p>

The current COW implementation is based on sound principles, and hopefully
the worst corner cases have now been ironed out. So, as a result, we might
have gotten to a better and more future-proof model for the copy-on-write
mechanism than we had before the 5.8 kernel. Yet, given the history of this
area, it would not be at all surprising to see more bug reports pop up in
the future.
<p>
Somewhat ironically, the original vulnerability that triggered
the whole ordeal is still exploitable when transparent huge pages are in
use. At this point, a fix targeted just for <tt>vmsplice()</tt> to break
COW immediately might be the safest option, especially for backporting to
older LTS kernels. However, the unfixed THP vulnerability might also be a
sign that transparent huge pages do not actually follow the new COW model
created for base pages, and if it's not feasible to adjust them (<a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/619738/">reference 
counting for THPs is a complicated topic</a> on its own), this might not be the
end of the story.

I hope kernel devs added automated tests for all these issues, and that those tests are run frequently. That&#x27;s the first thing I do when trying to unpick a complicated mess like this.<br>

I wonder if there is anything out there actually using vmsplice. It seems extremely hard to use facility anyways. And playing games with MMU with all the evil lock contention troubles, seems like asking for trouble as well.<br>

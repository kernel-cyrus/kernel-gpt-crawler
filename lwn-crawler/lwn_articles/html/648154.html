Tracing is a technique that is used for both performance analysis and
debugging.  A tracer generates its data into a log; these are tracing
events that can be later analyzed to understand the program's execution. Linux
has <a href="/Articles/365835/">ftrace</a> that can log function calls and tracepoint data for the
kernel. CPUs also support tracing mechanisms for different
events. <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/18/processor-tracing">Processor Trace</a> (PT) is a new tracing mechanism for Intel
CPUs that traces branches executing on the CPU, which allows the
reconstruction of the control flow of all executed code.


<p>
Intel CPUs have an older mechanism called BTS (Branch Trace Store) that
also allowed branch tracing, but it was slow and not widely
used. PT allows tracing with better performance and gathers additional
information, 
such as timing. Intel Processor Trace is supported on Broadwell CPUs.
More information can be found in the Processor Trace specification in the <a
href="http://www.intel.com/sdm">Intel Architecture Software Developer
Manuals</a>, volume 3, chapter 36.


<p>
Hardware tracing mechanisms were traditionally used from hardware
debuggers. But it is also possible to integrate them into the operating system,
which allows tight integration with its profiling and debugging
mechanisms. This makes it possible to use different trace
buffers for different processes, and to make the facility available for
non-root users.  More importantly, it also allows tracing on every system,
without 
needing to attach special debugging hardware.


<p>
The 4.1 kernel has an implementation of Processor Trace in the
kernel's perf_events subsystem that allows the use of PT through the perf
interface. The user-tools support is not quite merged yet, but is
expected for 4.2.  The code was developed by Alex Shishkin and Adrian
Hunter and was tested by Emmanuel Lucet.

<p>
Other architectures, such as ARM and MIPS, also have branch tracing
mechanisms, but these were not supported by operating system drivers
before. ARM is currently 
merging a separate driver for its <a
href="http://www.arm.com/products/system-ip/debug-trace/">CoreSight</a>
tracing, but that is using
a different, non-perf interface.

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>
Tracing branches on a modern CPU that runs multiple cores at
multi-GHz speeds can generate huge amounts of data. While the CPU
can do the actual tracing with little overhead — hardware can
do it in parallel — maintaining the bandwidth to a log buffer 
can be a challenge.  PT uses aggressive compression to make this problem
manageable: unconditional direct branches are not logged at all, conditional
branches are compressed to a single bit (taken or not-taken), and
<tt>CALL</tt>/<tt>RET</tt> instructions
can be elided by maintaining a call stack in the decoder.

<p>
A special PT decoder later reads the compressed trace stream. It decodes
the instructions in the executable. Every time it reaches a conditional
or indirect branch it consults the trace information to decide on
the branch target. Asynchronous events, such as interrupts or transaction
aborts, are also reported, in addition to time and processor frequency. 
The information is sufficient to reconstruct the full control flow
of the original program. The performance overhead is shifted from tracing
to decoding time.  Decoding is several orders of magnitude slower
than tracing.

<p>
Standard perf PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) drivers generate
"perf events" in the kernel in a standardized format and provide
them through a ring buffer to the "<tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt>" command in
user space. Using 
this approach directly is not possible with high-volume hardware
tracing, as a PT decoder running in the kernel would never
be able to keep up with the realtime instruction stream.

<p>
The perf PT driver instead dumps the tracing data directly to a
separate ring buffer and uses a decoder running later in user space
to generate perf_events, which are then processed by the standard perf
tool chain.  The decoder also needs side-band information to identify
the executables and associate different processes and threads with the
right binaries. Perf already had events for the metadata
information needed, as standard perf sampling also relies on user-space
post-processing to associate samples with executables. When 
multiple threads are traced on the same CPU, it also needs context
switch information, which is also available. PT
decoding uses both the tracing buffers per logical CPU, and the
side-band stream generated by perf.

<h4>User interface</h4>

<p>
The merging of the the PT code was a long, drawn-out exercise that took
about two years. The main sticking point was how to represent the
extra trace buffer in the perf_events API. After multiple iterations,
the final version uses an auxiliary data (AUX data) buffer associated with
the main perf 
ring buffer, which is shared between kernel and user space via
<tt>mmap()</tt>. The AUX buffer is allocated by <tt>mmap()</tt>ing an area
above the 
original perf ring buffer. The perf driver then configures the tracing
hardware to dump data into this buffer. When the buffer is filled up
the perf_events kernel code sends an AUX data event to the main perf
event ring buffer, which signals the amount of data available to
"<tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt>".   

<p>
In addition, normal perf events are used to collect the side-band data
needed for decoding. The AUX data infrastructure is
generic and can be used for other kinds of high-volume trace data.

<p>
After recording, the compressed data is decoded into standard perf
events.  This is done at "<tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt>" (or perf
script/inject) time.  To 
synchronize the side-band data with the hardware decoding stream, time
stamps are used. The side-band data is used to determine the executables and
threads, which are needed by the decoder to reconstruct the branch
stream. The trace stream reports events in Time Stamp Counter (TSC)
format, while perf events by default use the Linux trace clock.  The
kernel reports the necessary conversion factors and offsets. The
decoder interpolates timing for branch events between time packets,
and uses the resulting estimated time stamps to synchronize with
 tracepoint events for context switch and executable load.

<p>
To walk the executables and find the static and conditional branches,
the decoder uses Masami Hiramatsu's x86 instruction decoder from the
kernel tree.

<p>
The PT decoder then generates perf "sample" events from the trace
stream. It supports different sampling options, controlled
by the new <tt>--itrace</tt> option:

<pre>
    --itrace={letter}period
    i       synthesize "instructions" events
    b       synthesize "branches" events
    x       synthesize "transactions" events
    c       synthesize branches events (calls only)
    r       synthesize branches events (returns only)
    e       synthesize tracing error events
    d       create a debug log
    g[size] synthesize a call chain (use with i or x)
    period can be NUMBER unit (e.g. 10us)
</pre>

<p>
By default instructions are sampled approximately every 100µs (with the default
<tt>--itrace=i100us</tt> option).

<p>
Here is an example that records the execution of a simple program

<pre>
    % perf record -e intel_pt//u ls
    [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
    [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.190 MB perf.data ]
</pre>

<p>
After the recording, the trace needs to be
decoded. <tt>perf&nbsp;report</tt> will 
run the decoder and generate a histogram of the samples.

<pre>
    % perf report --stdio
    ...
    # Samples: 36  of event 'instructions:u'
    # Event count (approx.): 8613072
    #
    # Overhead  Command  Shared Object     Symbol                          
    # ........  .......  ................  ................................
    #
	27.78%  ls       libc-2.17.so      [.] get_next_seq                
		     |
		     ---get_next_seq
			__strcoll_l
    ...
</pre>

<p>
The tracer recorded 8,613,072 instructions, and the decoder sampled them
every 100µs. This is a somewhat faster sampling frequency than normal cycle
sampling with <tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt>, which can give better results.

<p>
The tracing supports the usual perf filters, like <tt>/u</tt> for user code
only, and <tt>/k</tt> 
for kernel code. There are also more tunables for the PMU that can be optionally
specified between the "<tt>/</tt>" delimiters:

<pre>
    tsc=0  	 Disable time stamps
    noretcomp	 Disable return compression
</pre>

<p>
In the example above, we used <tt>u</tt> to only record user space. Recording
kernel space is also possible with the right permissions, but requires
running the decoder as root.

<p>
Alternatively, we can also look at the exact trace, for example for debugging
or to find specific patterns for performance analysis. This can be done
with <tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt>. Since the default <tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt>
output is 
quite verbose,  
we limit the fields, but also add the source line if available. 
This traces the startup of the <tt>ls</tt> command, which begins by
executing the dynamic linker (<tt>ld-2.17.so</tt>).

<tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt> outputs branches instead of instructions by default.

<a href="/Articles/649627/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/pt-flamegraph-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Flame Graph]" title="Flame Graph" width=300 height=163>
</a>

<p>
The format is standard perf format, so existing scripts processing samples
will work. For example we could generate a
<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">Flame Graph</a>
using PT data (as seen at right).

<p>
<tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt>
also supports running Perl or Python scripts. We can use that
to directly analyze a trace. This is important because instruction 
traces are often too long to be read by a human. It is also
possible to use other tools that can process perf output to view
the information.

<p>
Perf also has the ability to store trace data into a database. The
<tt>export-to-postgresql.py</tt> script that is included with perf stores
branch information into 
a PostgreSQL database for later analysis with standard database tools.
The database pairs up calls and returns, which allows determining the
lifetime and the call-stack of every function call.

<h4>Limitations for non-root users</h4>

<p>
Perf supports recording as non-root. There are some limitations.  When
tracing multiple threads on a single CPU, perf uses the same tracing
buffer. To reconstruct the trace later, a context switch side-band
event is needed to find the correct executables. The PT decoder uses
the <tt>sched::sched_switch</tt> tracepoint to do this.  Tracepoints
traditionally need root rights (unless perf security is disabled with
<tt>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1</tt>).  If the tracepoint is not available,
newly created threads cannot be decoded. This implies that only the
single-threaded program that is started by perf or already existing
threads selected with <tt>--per-thread&nbsp;--uid/--pid/--tid</tt> can be
traced. In the future, a non-root context switch event, such 
as the one proposed in <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/9/513">this
patch</a>, 
would fix this problem.

<p>
Another issue is that the kernel code is self-modifying. To handle
kernel code, the decoder has to see the patched "live" image through
<tt>/proc/kcore</tt>, 
which is only available to root. The new <tt>perf-with-kcore.sh</tt> wrapper
script allows saving <tt>kcore</tt> as part of a perf session, which allows the
decoder to see the same state of the kernel code as during tracing.

<h4>Snapshot mode</h4>

<p>
The record example above attempts to store a complete trace of the
program to the disk. Storing complete traces typically only works for
programs with limited computation. For longer workloads, which do
significant computation with many branches, the disk I/O bandwidth is
eventually unable to keep up with the CPU, so there can be data
loss.

<p>
An alternative is to store the trace as a ring buffer to memory only,
and only stop and save the trace when an "event of interest" happens.
Memory has enough bandwidth to keep up with the traces in most cases.

<p>
This is especially useful for debugging: we're looking for the trace before
the bug to see how it happened. It is also useful for performance analysis.
For example, a common problem both in server and user interface tuning is
the need to 
analyze occasional latency spikes that cause visible delay to the user.

<p>
To handle this situation with PT, perf supports the new snapshot mode.  The
trace is started in ring-buffer mode, recording the trace constantly in
a memory ring-buffer, and saving the perf metadata to disk. 

<p>
When the event of interest happens, we send a <tt>SIGUSR2</tt> signal to the
<tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt> process, which then dumps the in-memory trace buffer
to the <tt>perf.data</tt> file.

<p>
So we need a program that sends the signal when something
interesting happens. For example, we can use a simple REST key-value
store that retrieves values from a database. Assume the database has
an occasional latency glitch that makes a transaction take too long;
we want to understand why. So we instrument the program to send
the signal to perf when a database operation takes too long. We can
then look at the trace later with <tt>perf&nbsp;script</tt> to find out
what caused 
the latency spikes.

<p>
To avoid having to run the test program as root, we disable
perf security and run the <tt>perf&nbsp;record</tt> as the same user ID as
the test. 
Otherwise the test program could not send signals to perf.

<pre>
    % sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1
</pre>

Start the tracing and run the <a href="/Articles/648186/">example
server</a> (<tt>simple-kv.py</tt>) in the background:

<pre>
    % perf record --snapshot -a -e intel_pt//u sleep 100 &amp;
    % export PERFPID=$!
    % python simple-kv.py &amp;
    % curl http://localhost:4000/foo
    # perf script -F time,comm,cpu,sym,dso,ip,srcline
    ... tracing output ...
</pre>

<h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>
When we use tracing for debugging, the obvious point of
interest is a crash or abort. With tracing information we gain the ability
to do limited backward debugging. The original PT patch kit had built-in
support for core dumps. A new rlimit allowed enabling tracing in
ring buffer mode for a program, and the trace would then be
automatically written to the core dump file.  The PT code that is
merged in 4.1 does not yet have this capability, but it will hopefully
eventually 
be re-added.

<p>
This raises the question of what to do with the core dump.
The original PT patch kit API was supported by GDB, which could both
read PT core dumps and also do live backward debugging for control
flow. The debugger allows you to virtually move inside the trace and allows
examining the program state (as available) at different points in the past.
GDB had support to do this earlier using <a
href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Process-Record-and-Replay.html#Process-Record-and-Replay">record
and replay</a> and using the earlier Branch Trace Store, but it was
extremely slow. PT will be a faster and more functional alternative.

<p>
A version of GDB supporting the current auxtrace kernel API is <a href="https://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2015-06/msg00453.html">currently
in development</a> by Markus Metzger. For decoding PT, GDB uses the 
<a href="https://github.com/01org/processor-trace">libipt</a> PT decoder, 
which provides a C API for decoding that can be also used for other PT tools.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
Hardware-based branch tracing is a powerful technique for debugging
and performance analysis. It can generate vast amounts of data that
allow the analysis of programs in new ways. In fact, the challenge will
not be to collect data on performance or debugging problems any more, but
instead more to find the right information in all of the information that can
now be collected. As of the 4.2 kernel, perf and other tools
will provide a range of powerful capabilities to generate branch
traces. It will also provide basic capabilities to display the data.
It will be interesting to see what new visualization and analysis
tools can be developed on top of that to make better use of this
rich source of data.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

&gt; ARM is currently merging a separate driver for its CoreSight tracing, but that is using a different, non-perf interface.
</font>
<p>
What's the justification for not using the perf interface in this case? This is going to fragment the trace-tools landscape (in a return to an unloved past)&hellip;

The goal is to provide multiple interfaces on top of the hardware, integration with perf is currently being worked on now that the baseline support is present - what's there currently is a building block that other interfaces like perf are built on. The Coresight IPs can offer a wider range of functionality than perf does (there's some system level trace support that can unify trace over the SoC for example) so lower level access is exposed.<br>

ARM CoreSight support has been available in the Linux kernel since 3.19.  At that time the infrastructure to convey trace data from kernel to user space via Perf (AUX data) did not exist, leaving the configuration and harvesting of trace data to sysfs.<br>
<p>
Now that this support is in place Linaro has been hard at work doing the integration of the existing drivers with the Perf framework.<br>

Does perf support something similar to the snapshot mode described in this article, but for regular perf events?<br>
<p>
Example: Suppose I am debugging the same latency glitch as described in this article. I am suspecting L1d misses to be the cause. When the glitch occurs, I would like to tell perf to dump the L1d misses. Is it something feasible with perf? <br>

snapshot mode is currently only supported for aux tracing, so no we can't yet dump other events on the signal.<br>
The other events are always continuously dumped, as the perf record needs to keep track of all the MMAP events and COMM to be able to decode later.<br>
I agree it would be a useful feature though.<br>

As an addendum, the gdb PT code has been merged into gdb git, hopefully included in the soon to be released gdb 7.10<br>
<p>
Here's a quick example with the git version:<br>
<p>
%  gdb ./tcrash<br>
GNU gdb (GDB) 7.9.50.20150702-cvs<br>
...<br>
(gdb) list main<br>
<p>
A test program that runs a loop, and crashes after a few iterations.<br>
<p>
1	<br>
2	int main(void)<br>
3	{<br>
4		int i;<br>
5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>
7				*(int *)0 = 0; /* crash */<br>
8		}<br>
9		return 0;<br>
10	}<br>
<p>
Start the program and enable PT recording and let it run<br>
<p>
(gdb) start<br>
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x4004f1: file tcrash.c, line 5.<br>
Starting program: /home/ak/tsrc/tcrash <br>
<p>
Temporary breakpoint 1, main () at tcrash.c:5<br>
5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
(gdb) record btrace pt<br>
(gdb) c<br>
Continuing.<br>
<p>
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.<br>
0x0000000000400505 in main () at tcrash.c:7<br>
7				*(int *)0 = 0; /* crash */<br>
<p>
Program crashes. So how did that happen?<br>
<p>
(gdb) info record<br>
Active record target: record-btrace<br>
Recording format: Intel(R) Processor Trace.<br>
Buffer size: 16kB.<br>
Recorded 47 instructions in 1 functions (0 gaps) for thread 1 (process 30214).<br>
<p>
Show some context before the crash.<br>
<p>
(gdb) record instruction-history /m -<br>
28	29	30	tcrash.c:6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>
   0x00000000004004fa &lt;main+13&gt;:	cmpl   $0x7,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
31	32	tcrash.c:5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
   0x000000000040050b &lt;main+30&gt;:	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
33	34	35	tcrash.c:6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>

<p>
36	37	tcrash.c:5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
   0x000000000040050b &lt;main+30&gt;:	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
<p>
We can repeat that to get more context<br>
<p>
(gdb) record instruction-history /m -<br>
18	19	20	tcrash.c:6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>
   0x00000000004004fa &lt;main+13&gt;:	cmpl   $0x7,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
21	22	tcrash.c:5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
   0x000000000040050b &lt;main+30&gt;:	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
23	24	25	tcrash.c:6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>
   0x00000000004004fa &lt;main+13&gt;:	cmpl   $0x7,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
26	27	tcrash.c:5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
   0x000000000040050b &lt;main+30&gt;:	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)<br>
<p>
<p>
Now step backwards.<br>
<p>
(gdb) reverse-step<br>
7				*(int *)0 = 0; /* crash */<br>
<p>
Ok this if statement has likely something to do with the crash.<br>
<p>
(gdb) reverse-step<br>
6			if (i &gt;= 8)<br>
<p>
Reading data is not supported, only control flow can be examined<br>
<p>
(gdb) p i<br>
$1 = &lt;unavailable&gt;<br>
(gdb) reverse-step<br>
5		for (i = 0; i  &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
<p>

(gdb) <br>

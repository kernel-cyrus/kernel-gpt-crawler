Over the last couple of years, the <a href="/Articles/612878/">Berkeley
packet filter (BPF)</a> in-kernel virtual
machine has gained capabilities and moved beyond its origins in the
networking subsystem.  Among other things, it has gained its own system
call — <tt>bpf()</tt> — to enable the loading of BPF programs into the
kernel and various ancillary functions.  In current kernels, <tt>bpf()</tt>
is a root-only system call, and truly root-only at that: one must be root
in the initial system namespace to use it.  But the plan always included
making <tt>bpf()</tt> available to unprivileged users; now patches are
circulating to take that last step.
<p>
Kernel developers are understandably nervous about allowing unprivileged
users to load code into the kernel for execution in kernel context.  It
does not take long to think of a number of ways in which things could go
wrong.  Getting past the initial reflex that says to simply disallow such
access requires a high degree of certainty that there is no way for a rogue
BPF program to compromise the kernel in any way.
<p>
The job of providing this assurance belongs to the BPF verifier module.  It
checks that any program presented for loading does not exceed the maximum
number of instructions (4096 by default) and that it does not contain any
loops, thus ensuring that it will not take excessive time to run.  All
jumps are checked to be sure that they land within the program (and don't
create loops).  Accesses to memory are not allowed to go outside the memory
area provided by the kernel.  The type of data stored in each accessible
memory location is tracked by simulating the program's execution;
instructions are not allowed to operate on inappropriate data types, and
uninitialized memory cannot be accessed.
<p>

According to BPF developer Alexei Starovoitov, there is just one thing that
is missing: ensuring that a BPF program cannot 
leak information about the kernel — and kernel pointers in particular — to
user space.  This information can be highly useful to an attacker trying to
exploit a vulnerability, so quite a bit of effort has gone into plugging
such leaks in recent years.  BPF programs do not have access to a great
deal of kernel information, but a hostile program still might succeed in
exfiltrating something that an attacker can use.  That makes it dangerous
to allow unprivileged users to load and run BPF programs.
<p>
Avoiding this problem requires extending the capabilities of the BPF
verifier; that is the intent of <a href="/Articles/660080/">this patch
set</a> from Alexei.  Since the verifier already knows the data types of
the values stored in each 
memory location, this is a matter of restricting what can be done with
locations containing pointer values.  So simply returning a pointer to user
space is clearly to be disallowed, as is storing a pointer into a BPF map.
Perhaps more subtly, comparison of pointers is also disallowed; otherwise a
BPF program could arrive at a pointer's value indirectly.
<p>
Another interesting possibility has to do with pointers stored in the
stack.  A clever program could try to overwrite parts of a pointer with
numeric values in a way that makes it possible to recover the original
pointer value, then return the resulting numeric value to user space.
The verifier clearly has to catch this case and block it.  The
list goes on, but the basic idea should be clear by now: there are a lot of
ways to sneak pointer values out to user space; the verifier must
anticipate and catch them all.  Alexei's patch set tries to get the
verifier to the point that it can meet that challenge.
<p>
Even with these checks in place, there are still some limits on the use of
BPF programs by unprivileged users.  In particular, with the current patch
set, only socket-filter programs can be loaded by those users.  BPF
programs used in other settings 
(tracing, for example) inherently have to deal with kernel data, so they
will remain restricted to root.  BPF programs also pin down some kernel
memory; to keep users from occupying too much memory, the space used is
charged against their <tt>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</tt> resource limit.  On many
systems, the default value of that limit may prove to be too small to load
useful programs, so it may need to be increased by the system
administrator.
<p>
Finally, there is a sysctl knob (<tt>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled</tt>)
that can be used to disable unprivileged access to <tt>bpf()</tt>
entirely.  It defaults to "false" (in the patch; distributors may choose
differently); if it is set to "true" it cannot be reset without a reboot.
There was some talk of adding more fine-grained control over what BPF
programs from unprivileged users can do, but Alexei <a
href="/Articles/660338/">dismissed</a> that idea as being driven only by
"fear."  If the verifier is working as intended, he said, there is no
reason for such fear and no use for finer-grained controls.
<p>
That does leave open the question of whether the verifier has indeed earned
the trust that is being placed in it, or whether perhaps some fear might be
justified.  It is 2000 lines or so of
moderately complex code that has been reviewed by a relatively small number
of (highly capable) people.  It is, in a real sense, an implementation of a
blacklist of prohibited behaviors; for it to work as advertised, all
possible attacks must have been thought of and effectively blocked.  That
is a relatively high bar.  There is a reason why David Miller <a
href="/Articles/660489/">described</a> the patch set as "<q>scary
stuff</q>". 
<p>
But David applied the patch set for the 4.4 merge
window despite his misgivings for a reason: as
with user namespaces, unprivileged BPF access has the potential to increase
system security by reducing the number of places where code must be run
with elevated privileges.  But first it has to get to a point where all of
the exploitable loose ends have been found and tied up — and the
introduction of new loose ends must be prevented.

That point may well be reached in the relatively near future.  But it would
not be surprising if this feature were to be disabled by distributors 
for a while after it hits the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sounds like the verifier itself is going to be rather complex code. I wonder if that can be simplified if BPF would not be some binary bytecode but rather an encoded AST for a higher level language as used, for example, for WebAssembly. It is much simpler to verify AST and translate it into an internal bytecode or even JIT it than to write a correct verifier for bytecode.<br>

I think the low-level verification is better than a higher level one. A high level verifier might give a better explanation about why it would reject some particular construct, but multiple higher level constructs would map to similar lower level bytecode, so it would have to take into consideration a lot more cases. <br>
<p>
In contrast the low-level verification only has to permit certain operations on certain values (the trick is knowing which operations on which type of value are needed and which can be abused), no matter the construct used to generate that operation. <br>
<p>
And the more those AST have a direct correspondence to their bytecode the smaller the difference will be between both approaches. A bytecode can easily be transformed into an AST for an albeit very low-level language.<br>

Preventing information leakage is very difficult so it is better to start with a restrictive whitelist of allowed constructs than one can be reasonably sure are safe and gradually widen the set. It is much easier to implement such white-list in a higher level verifier precisely because it can distinguish a particular code pattern with much less efforts and O(N) complexity. <br>
<p>
Otherwise I am afraid that a story of Java bytecode verification would repeat itself, albeit of a smaller scale. It took years for Sun to iron out bugs. Then it turned out that they could not do better then O(N**4) complexity in the worst case of the verification making DoS against a browser trivial. So they were forced to extend the bytecode format with extra information to simply the job for the verifier. That bloated already rather fat bytecode and introducing subtle compatibility bugs in quite a few applications. <br>

Unless the description is inaccurate, it looks to me like a whitelist.  There is a list of permitted operations that can be chained together, with optional skipping of subsequences.  As long as sequence ABC is OK, and operation D is OK, then sequence ABCD is OK, and ABD is too.<br>

<p>
both perf_fuzzer and trinity have some form of bpf() fuzzing code.<br>
<p>
so far the perf_fuzzer implementation wasn't that useful due to having to run as root, but if userspace bpf does get in (and somehow perf_event can handle that) then fuzzing will be happening once I figure out how to set it up.<br>

Sounds like a variation on the "tainting" that Perl has. The pointers in memory are tainted, any operation on a tainted value produces a tainted result. You cannot return a tainted value.<br>
<p>
Although, this wouldn't work because you have to deal with control flow being tainted, using branches to test a tainted value. The difference with Perl being that in Perl the data is untrusted, and in BPF the code is untrusted.<br>
<p>
Still, it feels like a problem that if approached the right way should be solvable in an easy to verify way. I hope...<br>

Why are unprivileged BPF user programmes even allowed to access kernel pointer values in any way?<br>

A group at CMU was looking into what they called "proof carrying code" for this purpose in the late 1990s or early 2000s.<br>
<p>
The idea is that you present two things: (1) the program and (2) a proof that the program works.  The kernel would need to verify the proof, but verification is typically trivial, i.e., the code that does it is small and easy to understand.<br>
<p>
Coming up with the proof in the first place is mechanical for the class of filter programs you are mostly interested in.  For a hand-written and clever program it might not be easy.<br>

I've always wondered what happened to proof-carrying-code. Why didn't it catch on, especially for these kinds of use cases? Why hasn't it been used for things like NaCl/WASM? It seemed like it was making good progress in the late '90s, then I haven't really heard much about it since. Was there some critical flaw found? Just not trendy enough and lost funding?

Judging from the link in the article, davem thought this was a feature that was useful but had a high risk of security-critical bugs, at least until it had been tested against the real world for a while, which seems to have been a completely correct assessment.<br>

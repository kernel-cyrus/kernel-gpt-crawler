<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 8, 2016</br>
           </div>
Oscar Wilde once famously observed that fashion "<q>is usually a form of
ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months</q>".
Perhaps the same holds true of locking primitives in the kernel; basic
mechanisms like the mutex have been through many incarnations over the
years.  This season, it would appear that <a
href="/Articles/699094/">coupled atomic locks</a> are all the rage with the
trendiest kernel developers, so it should not be surprising that a new
mutex implementation using those locks is making the rounds.  This code may
be glittering and shiny, but it also has the potential to greatly simplify
the mutex implementation.
<p>
A mutex is a sleeping lock, meaning that kernel code that tries to acquire
a contended 
mutex may go to sleep to wait until that mutex becomes available.  Early mutex
implementations would always put a waiter to sleep, but, following the
scalability trends of the day, mutexes soon gained a glamorous accessory:
optimistic spinning.  Waking a sleeping thread can take a long time and,
once that thread gets going, it may find that the processor cache contains
none of its data, leading to unfashionable cache misses.  A thread that spins
waiting for a mutex, instead, will 
be able to grab it quickly once it becomes available and will likely still
be cache-hot.  Enabling optimistic spinning can improve performance
considerably.  There is a cost, in that mutexes are no longer fair (they
can be "stolen" from a thread that has been waiting for longer), but being
properly <i>Ã  la mode</i> is never free.
<p>
Optimistic spinning brings with it an interesting complication, though, in
that it requires tracking the current owner of the mutex.  If that owner
sleeps, or if the owner changes while a thread is spinning, it doesn't
make any sense to continue spinning, since the wait is likely to be long.
As a field within the mutex, the owner information is best 
protected by the mutex itself.  But, by its nature, this information must
be accessed by threads that do not own the mutex.  The result is some
tricky code that is trying to juggle the lock itself and the owner
information at the same time.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra has sent <a href="/Articles/699566/">an alternative
mechanism</a> down the runway; it takes care of this problem by combining
the owner 
information and lock status into a single field within the mutex.  In
current kernels, the <tt>count</tt> field, an <tt>atomic_t</tt> value,
holds the status of the lock itself, while <tt>owner</tt>, a pointer to
<tt>struct task_struct</tt>, indicates which thread owns the mutex.
Peter's patch removes both of those fields, replacing them with a single
<tt>atomic_long_t</tt> value called "<tt>owner</tt>".
<p>
This value is 64 bits wide, large enough to hold a pointer value.  If
the mutex is available, there is no owner, so the new <tt>owner</tt> field
contains zero.  When the mutex is taken, the acquiring thread's
<tt>task_struct</tt> pointer is placed there, simultaneously indicating
that the mutex is unavailable and which thread owns it.  The
<tt>task_struct</tt> structure must be properly aligned, though, meaning
that the bottom bits of a pointer to it will always be zero, so those bits
are available for other locking-related purposes.  Following this season's
coupled-lock trend, two of those bits are so
used, in ways that will be described shortly.
<p>
With the new organization, the code to attempt to acquire a mutex now looks
like this:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline bool __mutex_trylock(struct mutex *lock)
    {
    	unsigned long owner, curr = (unsigned long)current;
    
    	owner = atomic_long_read(&amp;lock-&gt;owner);
    	for (;;) { /* must loop, can race against a flag */
    	    unsigned long old;
    
    	    if (__owner_task(owner))
    		return false;
    	    old = atomic_long_cmpxchg_acquire(&amp;lock-&gt;owner, owner,
    					      curr | __owner_flags(owner));
    	    if (old == owner)
    		return true;
    	    owner = old;
    	}
    }
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>__owner_task()</tt> and <tt>__owner_flags()</tt> macros simply mask
out the appropriate parts of the <tt>owner</tt> field.
The key is the <tt>atomic_long_cmpxchg_acquire()</tt> call, which attempts
to store the current thread as the owner of the mutex on the assumption
that it is available.  Should some other thread own the mutex, that call
will fail, and the mutex code will know that it will have to work harder.
<p>
There are currently two flags that can be stored in the least significant
bits of <tt>owner</tt>.  If a thread finds it must sleep while waiting for
a contended mutex, it will set <tt>MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS</tt>; the thread
currently holding the mutex will then know it must wake the waiters when
the mutex is freed.  Most of the time, it is hoped, there will be no
waiters; maintaining this bit allows for a bit of unnecessary work to
be skipped. 
<p>
As mentioned above, optimistic spinning, while good for performance, is
unfair; in the worst case, an unlucky thread contending for a highly
contended mutex could be starved for a long time.  In an attempt to prevent
that problem, the second <tt>owner</tt> bit, <tt>MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF</tt>,
can be used to change how a contended mutex changes ownership.
<p>
If a thread tries and fails to obtain a mutex after having already slept
waiting for it to become available, it can set
<tt>MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF</tt> prior to returning to sleep.  Later on, when the
mutex is freed, the freeing thread will notice the flag and behave
differently.  In particular, it must avoid clearing the <tt>owner</tt>
field as it normally would, lest some other thread, spinning on the mutex,
steal it away.  Instead, it finds the first thread in the wait queue for
the mutex and transfers ownership directly, waking that thread once the
job is done.  This dance restores some fairness, at the cost of making
everybody wait for the sleeping thread to wake up and get its work done.
<p>
The new code simplifies the mutex implementation considerably by getting
rid of a number of strange cases involving the separate <tt>count</tt> and
<tt>owner</tt> fields.  But it gets a bit better than that, since the new
code is also architecture-independent; all of the old,
architecture-specific mutex code can go away.  So the bottom line of
Peter's cover letter reads:
<p>

    49 files changed, 382 insertions(+), 1407 deletions(-)
</pre>
<p>
Removing code, as it happens, is always in fashion, and removing 1000 lines
of tricky assembly-language locking code is especially chic.  Assuming that
this code manages to avoid introducing performance regressions, it could be
a must-have item at a near-future merge-window ball.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Couldn't the MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF case also be handled by having the spinning tasks notice the flag and immediately stop spinning and switch to the slow path?<br>

Tracepoints provide a great deal of visibility into the inner workings of
the kernel, which is both a blessing and a curse.  The advantages of
knowing what the kernel is doing are obvious; the disadvantage is that
tracepoints risk becoming a part of the kernel's ABI if applications start
to depend on them.  The need to maintain tracepoints could impede the
ongoing development of the kernel.  Ways of avoiding this problem have been
discussed for years; at the 2017 Kernel Summit, Steve Rostedt talked about
yet another scheme.
<p>
The risk of creating a new ABI has made some maintainers reluctant to add
instrumentation to their parts of the kernel, he said.  They might be
willing to add new interfaces to provide access to specific information
but, in the absence of tools that use this information, it is hard to
figure out which information is needed or what a proper interface would be.
The solution might be to 
adopt an approach that is similar to the staging tree, where
not-ready-for-prime-time drivers can go until they are brought up to the
necessary level of quality.
<p>
People talk about "tracepoints", but there are actually two mechanisms in
the kernel.  Internally, a tracepoint is a simple marker in the code, a
hook to which a kernel function can be attached.  What user space sees as a

<a href="/Articles/737535/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/osse/SteveRostedt-sm.jpg" alt="[Steve Rostedt]"
title="Steve Rostedt" class="lthumb"></a>

tracepoint is actually a "trace event", which is a specific interface that
is implemented using the internal tracepoints.  Without trace events, there
is no interface visible to user space.
<p>
The proposed solution to the ABI problem is to place a tracepoint at
locations of interest, but not bother 
with the trace event.  Making the tracepoint available to user space would
then require loading a kernel module; this module would be kept out of the
mainline tree.  It would be, he said, a development space to try out
interfaces for the more sensitive tracepoints.  Since it is not a part of
the mainline kernel, it could not become part of the kernel ABI.  But
distributors 
could ship this module, making the tracepoints available to user-space
developers. 
<p>
Ben Hutchings, a Debian kernel maintainer, said that this approach would
not work in a number of cases.  There are many situations where it's not
possible to just load a random module into the kernel.  Many customers are
using module signing, for example, to prevent exactly that from happening.
Even if distributions ship this module,
users of different distribution would have different modules and the
tracepoints would be 
incompatible; that would make it harder to write tools to use them.
<p>
Another member of the audience expressed skepticism, saying that if every
distributor ships this module, it will become an ABI that has to be
maintained anyway.  Ben Herrenschmidt agreed and suggested that the right
solution was to make the tracepoints be self-describing.  But, as Rostedt
pointed out, they are already self-describing, but changing the
availability of information will still break things.  Tools may depend on
specific information that is no longer available, or they may simply ignore
the format information for the tracepoint.   That makes it hard to
remove obsolete tracepoints which, since they each occupy about 5KB of
memory, is unfortunate.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox asked whether the proposed scheme would have solved the
problem with 
powertop, which broke some years ago when a variable was removed from a
tracepoint.  Rostedt said that it would have; Ted Ts'o noted that the
powertop problem shows that self-describing formats do not work as a
solution to this problem.
<p>
Much of the current work is being pushed by developers within Facebook, who
use a vast library of tracepoints to diagnose performance problems.  They
are willing to deal with their tools breaking when the kernel changes.
That led Andrew Morton to ask whether Linus Torvalds made the right call by
including tracepoints in the kernel ABI.  Rostedt said he disagrees with
that decision, but it doesn't matter, since Torvalds has the final say.
David Woodhouse complained that the group
was talking about "arbitrary technical nonsense"; perhaps the loaded module
should just set a flag to make the tracepoints available.  Morton agreed
that the module idea "sounds like bullshit" and suggested that perhaps it
was time to get the rule changed.  But Rostedt has tried that before, he
said, and he still bears the scars that resulted.
<p>
Chris Mason said that, while Facebook can handle tracepoint changes that
break its tools, there is a need to know when such a change has happened.
Just moving the ABI to a loadable module will not solve that problem; it
just pushes the problem onto the distributors instead.
<p>
Ts'o then launched into a discussion of the growing set of tools that work
by attaching BPF scripts to tracepoints.  These tools are becoming popular
and soon will be as popular as powertop; that will result in the same kinds
of problems when they break.  The problem is here now and needs to be
addressed.
<p>
Doing so will be hard, he said.  The topic had been suggested for the
invitation-only Maintainers Summit, since it is "fundamentally a Linus
problem", but Torvalds had <a href="/Articles/737532/">vetoed it</a>.
Torvalds wants to make a guarantee to user-space tools that works in 99% of
the cases, but it is hard to live up to for tools that are closely tied to
the kernel.  So the powertop problem will come again, only worse; BPF will
"turn it into a trainwreck".  Rostedt added that Linux started off as "a
desktop toy", but it is no longer a
simple system.  Nobody knows the whole thing, so they are relying more on
tooling to know what is going on.
<p>
The conversation came to an end about here, but the topic did return at the
Maintainers Summit later that week, after Torvalds and Rostedt had
discussed it.  The solution that was arrived at for now, as related by
Torvalds, is to hold off on 
adding explicit tracepoints to the kernel.  Instead, support will be added
to make it easy for an application to attach a BPF script to any function
in the kernel, with 
access to that function's arguments.  That should give tools access to the
information they need, and may make it possible to (eventually) remove many
of the existing explicit tracepoints.
<p>
Arnd Bergmann asked what would happen if a popular script breaks as the
result of the removal of a function; Torvalds replied that he would not see
it as a regression that needs to be fixed.  But, he said, if that happens
it should be seen as a sign that the kernel should be providing that
information in a more straightforward manner.  A tracepoint or other
interface could be added at that time.
<p>
Whether this solution provides what the tools need will take time to
determine.  But if it does, it may just be possible that a multi-year
debate has finally come to some sort of conclusion that all of the parties
involved can live with.

<p>
Sounds like the "attach a BPF script to any function" mechanism would have an ABI like that of init_module or finit_module: the thing it loads lives inside the kernel, making it fall under the kernel's internal ABI (lack of) guarantees rather than the userspace ABI guarantees.<br>

We had a variant of that in Solaris, specifically in the libraries, which had to be both stable and changable (;-))<br>
<p>
David J. Brown attached version numbers to function entry points, like SUNW_1.1 (for something public: SUNWprivate for everything else). If the entry point changed, even if the function signature was the same, the number got bumped to SUNW_1.2.<br>
<p>
If a tracepoint points to a function to attach a BPF script to, the script for that tracepoint can check if the function version has changed, and if it has, the person using it can go and do a "git blame" hunt to see what they need to do.<br>

It sounds like there are conflicting use cases for tracepoints: kernel debugging and exporting data to userspace.  The powertop example begs the question of why a tracing framework is needed to collect process statics (looks like wake ups).  Couldn't that be accomplished by enhanced process statics that could be exposed via sysfs when enabled?<br>

There is already support for running a BPF program when an arbitrary kernel function is called, with access to that function's arguments -- this can be done using kprobes. Indeed, in BCC (<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc</a>) we have a large collection of BPF-based tools that rely on tracepoints when available, and kprobes when not. Over the last 1.5 years, we had multiple tools break because of intentional and unintentional changes to kernel functions when using kprobes; not so much when using tracepoints.<br>

It's ABI-sensitive, but if a language or runtime decides to pass arguments in a heap location or something that's not the standard ABI, it won't work (i.e. debuginfo isn't used).<br>

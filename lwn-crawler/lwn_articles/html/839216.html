           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 7, 2020</br>
           </div>
One of the kernel's primary jobs is to manage the memory installed in the
system.  Over the years, though, there have been various reasons for
removing a portion of the system's memory from the kernel's view.  One of
the latest can be seen in a mechanism called <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1607332046.git.yuleixzhang@tencent.com/">DMEMFS</a>,
which is being proposed as a way to get around some inefficiency in how the
kernel keeps track of RAM.
<p>
In the early years, the motivation for hiding memory from the kernel was to
avoid the problems caused by fragmentation.  Allocating large contiguous
areas tended to be nearly impossible after a system had been running for
some time, creating problems for hardware that absolutely could not
function without such areas.  Once upon a time, an out-of-tree patch called
"bigphysarea" was often used to reserve a range of memory for such
allocations; since the kernel did not get its hands on this memory
directly, it could not fragment it.  LWN first <a
href="/1999/1230/a/bigphysarea.html">captured a bigphysarea
announcement</a> in 1999, but the patch had been around for some time by
then.
<p>
In the relatively recent past (2010), the <a
href="/Articles/396702/">contiguous memory allocator (CMA) patches</a> provided a
similar functionality using the same technique.  Since then, though, the
problem of allocating large contiguous areas has gotten much smaller.  The
kernel's own defragmentation mechanisms have improved considerably, and
simply having more memory around also helps.  CMA <a
href="/Articles/486301/">now relies on compaction</a> 
and no longer uses a carved-out memory region.
<p>
DMEMFS has a different motivation.  The kernel tracks memory via a data
structure called the "memory map", which is essentially an array of <a
href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>page</tt> structures</a>.  A great deal of
information is packed into this structure to tell the kernel how each page
is used, track its position on various lists, connect it to its backing
store, and more.  Much effort has been expended over the years to keep
<tt>struct page</tt> as small as possible, but it still occupies
64&nbsp;bytes on 64-bit systems.
<p>
That may not seem like a lot of memory but, with the usual page size of
4KB, there are a lot of these structures in a contemporary system.  A
laptop with 16GB installed has 4,194,304 pages, meaning that 256MB of
memory is used just to keep track of memory.  Losing that much memory on a
laptop is perhaps tolerable, but there are other settings where it hurts
more.  In the patch posting, author Yulei Zhang points out that a hosting
provider running servers with 320GB of installed memory is losing 5GB of
that memory to <tt>page</tt> structures.  If that memory could be
reclaimed, the provider could cram more guests into the machine, increasing
the revenue that each server brings in â€” a metric that hosting providers
pay a lot of attention to.
<p>
As described above, DMEMFS works by carving out a portion of system memory
at boot time; the exact amount is controlled with the <tt>dmem=</tt>
command-line parameter.  The specified amount is reserved on <i>each</i>
NUMA node in the system; if that amount starts with "!", it tells
DMEMFS how much memory to give the kernel while grabbing the rest.  Once
the system has booted, this carved-out memory can be allocated by mounting
the <tt>dmemfs</tt> filesystem and creating one or more files of the
desired size.  A call to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
will map that memory into a process's address space.  A DMEMFS file can also be
handed to QEMU as the backing store for a guest machine.  This memory
supports NUMA policies and can provide huge pages, just like ordinary
memory.
<p>
Perhaps DMEMFS is the best solution for use cases where making the most use
of memory is paramount and there is no need for the kernel to actually
manage that memory.  But this is a 37-part patch set adding over 3,400
lines of code dedicated to cutting the kernel out of the management of an
important system resource; whenever something like that comes along, it's
worth looking at the source of the problem and whether other solutions
might exist.
<p>
Back in 1991, when the first Linux kernel was posted, machines had less
memory than they do now.  <a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=infoworld&amp;pg=PT73&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">This
archived PC ad</a> is instructive; a high-end system featured 4MB of RAM
and cost a mere 3,700 1991 dollars.  That system used 4KB pages, so there
were a total of 1,024 pages for the kernel to manage.  Most
personal-computer systems at that time had less memory than that.
<p>
Contemporary computers are rather larger, but the page size remains 4KB, so
the number of pages managed by the kernel has increased by three orders of
magnitude or so.   The number of <tt>page</tt> structures has increased
accordingly.  Those structures have also gotten larger; the transition to
64-bit processors, in particular, led to a significant increase in the size
of <tt>struct page</tt>.  The increased size hurts, obviously, but the
sheer number of <tt>page</tt> structures also increases overhead in many
places in the kernel.
<p>
One possible solution is to increase the size of the pages managed by the
kernel, clustering multiple physical pages into larger groups if need be.
Some architectures support use of larger page sizes now; the arm64 kernel
can use a 64KB page size, for example.  Over the years, numerous developers
have attempted to implement some sort of generalized page clustering in the
kernel, but none of those efforts have made it into the mainline.  The
complexity of the task has been one impediment to getting this work merged,
but it's not the only one.
<p>
The other concern with using larger page sizes is internal fragmentation â€”
wasting memory in situations where full pages must be allocated but only a
small amount of memory is needed.  A classic example is representing a
small file in the page cache.  A one-line shell script may fit into less
than 100&nbsp;bytes, but it still needs a full page in the page cache.
Anything beyond those 100&nbsp;bytes is wasted; larger pages will clearly
waste more.  Decades-old folk wisdom says that most files on Unix systems
are small; that may be less true that it once was, though.
<p>
Your editor is unaware of any studies that have made a serious effort to
measure the memory lost to internal fragmentation on real-world systems
with a larger page size, but this concern has made it hard to get patches
merged anyway.  At the moment, the work that is closest is probably the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200529025824.32296-1-willy@infradead.org/">large
pages in the page cache</a> effort by Matthew Wilcox â€” which applies at a
higher level and will not reduce the number of <tt>page</tt> structures in
the system.
<p>
As a result, the DMEMFS patches may need to be merged for the simple reason
that they exist now and work.  But it may well be that the real solution to
this problem lies elsewhere; rather than hide pages from the kernel, reduce
the overhead within the kernel by dealing with memory in larger chunks.  It
seems inevitable that increasing memory sizes will eventually force that
change; said change has, however, proved entirely evitable for many years
of memory-size growth.  Until the kernel can be changed to deal with memory
more efficiently, there may be no choice other than merging workarounds
that simply take the kernel out of the picture.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I guess it matters how much you value the features that the kernel brings along with that ~1.5% of RAM &quot;tax&quot;.  If you or your customers dislike swap and KSM in the first place, you probably look at that 1.5% as being a total waste.  In the long run, I suspect that 1.5% of your RAM is pretty cheap price to pay for all the features the kernel brings.<br>

Here are some difficulties:<br>
1. This means that reading such files will ALWAYS lead to I/Os. Most of the time, I/O means more latency compared with accessing memory.<br>
2. An executable file such as a shell script needs to be mmapped before running. Memory mapping requires page caching.<br>

I&#x27;m not proposing removing the cache entirely, just using some kind of a high-granularity malloc-ish allocator for small files instead of page-based granularity.<br>

Sure. There should be a mechanism to transform this kind of cache into full page-based cache (and probably back).<br>

<p>
Am I understanding you correctly, that you propose to store many small files in one page and whenever someone wants to mmap, copy the file to a fresh page and remove this page again once the file is no longer needed? <br>
<p>
Indeed this sounds like a good compromise: More compact cache with the downside to copy a few hundred bytes before a file can be accessed. And if there is a process accessing many small files, you can even copy all of them to the same page. It may be tempting to avoid the copy altogether, but then the kernel would have to check first, that in the page backing a file that is about to be mmaped, there is no information (especially no file) that the process should not have access to. <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  Am I understanding you correctly, that you propose to store many small files in one page and whenever someone wants to mmap, copy the file to a fresh page and remove this page again once the file is no longer needed? </font><br>
Essentially. I was thinking about just using something like SLAB for it.<br>
<p>
If we go to 64kb pages (or even 16kb like apparently on the Apple Silicon), the overhead of unused pages would be kinda significant.<br>

The THP patchset attempts to provide this benefit without this overhead.<br>
<p>
As Jon notes, the struct pages still exist, but they essentially go unused.  Memory is managed in larger chunks.  Exactly how much larger depends on how the application uses the file.  Small files would still use a 4kB page, but if you open() a file and read 32kB from it, the page cache will allocate an order-3 page and manage that 32kB as a single entity.<br>
<p>
YMMV, do feel free to try out the current patchset (if you use XFS)<br>

Given the existence of huge pages, clearly not all pages on a system have to be the same size. Why not define &quot;tiny pages&quot; of e.g. 256 bytes that can be used to back small files, with 4/16/64KB &quot;normal&quot; pages, and 1/2/4MB huge pages (and larger?) - which are chosen per-allocation to minimise wastage?<br>
<p>
Yes, PAGESIZE might need to be the lowest multiple of all of these (i.e. 256 bytes) but is there any reason that that would cause any insoluble problems?<br>

Because the possible page sizes depend on what the actual MMU hardware supports?<br>
<p>
You can find a list of supported sizes for contemporary architectures at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_</a>(computer_memory).<br>
The smallest page size in the list is 4 KiB, which is something most architectures settled on more than 20 years ago.<br>
Older systems did support smaller page sizes. IIRC the MC68451 and MC68851 supported pages as small as 1 KiB. Still larger than 256 bytes, though.<br>

Couldn&#x27;t the page cache merge such small files into a single page transparently? Seems a bit weird to me that caching 40 ~100 byte files would need 40 pages (160 KiB) not only one - I mean there&#x27;s probably some overhead of an access structure, but should be still much better.<br>
<p>
I could imagine that there may be some security issues (some side channel?) or complexity issues making this non trivial, but that&#x27;s just speculation.<br>

The &quot;thousands of small files&quot; is only during development.   Most JS builds end up merging the source files into one big file for distribution.<br>

This is because HTTP is similarly inefficient at transferring many small files versus one larger one.<br>

Not necessarilyâ€¦ it&#x27;s completely up to the developers.<br>

See kibana for example (an elasticsearch product). It ships with a staggering amount of js files and random garbage, since the repos of those libraries are all cloned. So it contains licenses, README, .h files, example files, and whatnot.<br>

One of the biggest problems with patchsets like dmemfs and other approaches to the problem is that if there is no struct page for a particular blob of memory, Linux is not able to do I/O to it.  There are various historical reasons for this, but it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s going to have to be addressed.  It&#x27;ll be a huge undertaking.  If you&#x27;ve heard of data structures like the &#x27;struct bio&#x27;, the &#x27;struct scatterlist&#x27; and &#x27;struct skbuff&#x27;, they&#x27;re full of references to struct pages.  So every driver (networking, block, usb) that touches hardware will have to change.  It is a daunting prospect.<br>
<p>
I think Joao&#x27;s approach has a much higher chance of success.<br>

Obviously I&#x27;m biased because I&#x27;ve been &#x27;helping&#x27; with (aka throwing peanuts at) his approach, but I&#x27;d recommend taking a look at it.<br>

This all seems reminiscent of NVRAM.  If you have terabytes of NVRAM and want to mmap some of it, you need the struct page, but where do you put it?<br>
I recall talk of dynamically allocating struct page on demand, but I don&#x27;t know what the final outcome was.<br>
<p>
Was there a resolution that avoided permanently allocating the struct-page?<br>
<p>
If there was, could it be used here?  e.g. tell the kernel to treat some chunk of memory just like NVRAM, and allocate struct-page only on demand??<br>

      As it happens, I have recently tried to <a href="http://al.howardknight.net/?ID=160779860100">measure the additional internal fragmentation from larger pages</a>.

The results are (memory sizes in KB):

<pre>
VMAs unique    used     total      8KB    16KB    32KB    64KB   
 7552  2333    555964  1033320    6704   22344   56344  125144 machine1
82836 25276   5346060 15707448   76072  223000  514472 1113672 machine2
47017 15425 105490636 60186068   40804  134492  319852  708588 machine3

So the additional cost of going to 8KB pages seems to be quite modest.

<p>One other solution that comes to my mind: File system developers have tried to tackle the overhead of block meta-data by instead using meta-data for extents, which may be larger than blocks, but make space management more complex.  Maybe a similar approach could help for reducing page meta-data for memory.

      <blockquote><font class="QuotedText">A laptop with 16GB installed has 4,194,304 pages, meaning that 256MB of memory is used just to keep track of memory. [...] a hosting provider running servers with 320GB of installed memory is losing 5GB of that memory to page structures.</font></blockquote>

<p>I don't get it... It seems that since time immemorial<sup>1</sup>, 64-bit Linux has <em>always</em> used 1/64 of physical RAM just to maintain page structures.  No matter if one has 512 MB or 64 GB, that system is using 1/64 (=1.5625%) of RAM to keep track of the RAM.</p>

<p>So that begs the question:  How come this is *just now* becoming an issue?  And are you really <em>losing</em> the memory?  After all, with pretty much any shared computing resource, there's always going to be some administrative overhead to maintaining said resource.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> At least since 1994, when Linux was ported to the 64-bit DEC Alpha (IIRC; someone correct me if I'm wrong).</p>

      With virtualisation, you're paying the tax twice â€” once in the guest and once in the host.
<p>
As you say, you pretty much need to pay that for a general-purpose operating system. But for an OS that is only hosting standardised virtual machines running known workloads, you don't need to. I think the point of the "5 GB" is that we're now getting to the point where the tax in the host is roughly the amount you need for another guest.

Various modern CPUs can support multiple page sizes. And OSs can not just use those internally, but make them available to processes. Solaris has allowed stack and heap page size preferences (from those available on the particular hardware) to be set to non-default values, and mmap(2) together with memcntl(2) to achieve that effect for mmap() calls. Used prudently, that can considerably reduce page table entries required. I have the impression that on some CPUs, that can be used by a hypervisor too, handy insofar as VMs are big memory users. I think VirtualBox can do that on a Solaris host, but only with a suitable Intel CPU (not with those lacking the needed features nor with an AMD, even if it has some virtualization acceleration features).<br>

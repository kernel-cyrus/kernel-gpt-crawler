<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 7, 2019</br>
           </div>
In the beginning, programs run on the in-kernel BPF virtual machine had no
persistent internal state and no data that was shared with any other part
of the system.  The arrival of eBPF and, in particular, its maps
functionality, has changed that situation, though, since a map can be
shared between two or more BPF programs as well as with processes running
in user space.  That sharing naturally leads to concurrency problems, so
the BPF developers have found themselves needing to add
primitives to manage concurrency (the "exchange and add" or <tt>XADD</tt>
instruction, for example).  The next step is the addition of a
spinlock mechanism to protect 
data structures, which has also led to some wider discussions on what the
BPF memory 
model should look like.

<p>
A BPF map can be thought of as a sort of array or hash-table data
structure.  The actual data stored in a map can be of an arbitrary type,
including structures.  If a complex structure is read from a map while it
is being modified, the result may be internally
inconsistent, with surprising (and probably unwelcome) results.  In an
attempt to prevent such problems, Alexei Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190116050830.1881316-1-ast@kernel.org/">introduced BPF
spinlocks</a> in mid-January; after a number of quick review cycles, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190131234012.3712779-1-ast@kernel.org/">version&nbsp;7
of the patch set</a> was applied on February&nbsp;1.  If all goes well,
this feature will be included in the 5.1 kernel.
<p>
<h4>BPF spinlocks</h4>
<p>
BPF spinlocks can only be placed inside structures that, in turn, are stored
in BPF maps.  Such structures should contain a field like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bpf_spin_lock lock;
</pre>
<p>
A BPF spinlock inside a given structure is meant to protect that structure
in particular from concurrent access.  There is no way to protect other
data, such as an entire BPF map, with a single lock.
<p>
From the point of view of a BPF program, this lock will behave much like an
ordinary kernel spinlock.  An example provided with the patch-set cover
letter starts by defining a structure containing a counter:
<p>
<pre>
    struct hash_elem {
    	int cnt;
    	struct bpf_spin_lock lock;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Code that is compiled to BPF could then increment the counter atomically
with something like the following:
<p>
<pre>
    struct hash_elem *val = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&amp;hash_map, &amp;key);
    if (val) {
    	bpf_spin_lock(&amp;val-&gt;lock);
    	val-&gt;cnt++;
    	bpf_spin_unlock(&amp;val-&gt;lock);
    }
</pre>
<p>
BPF programs run in a restricted environment, so there is naturally a long
list of rules that regulate the use of spinlocks.  Only certain types of
maps (hash, array, and control-group local storage) support spinlocks at
all, and only one spinlock is allowed within any given map element.  BPF
programs can only acquire one lock at a time (to head off deadlock
worries), cannot call external functions while holding a lock, and must
release a lock prior to returning.  Direct access to the
<tt>struct bpf_spin_lock</tt> field by the BPF program is disallowed.  A
number of other rules apply as well; see <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190131234012.3712779-2-ast@kernel.org/">this patch</a>
for a more complete list.
<p>
Access to BPF spinlocks from user space is naturally different; a
user-space process cannot be allowed to hold BPF spinlocks for unbounded
periods of time since that would be an easy way to lock up a kernel thread.  The
complex <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt>
system call</a> thus does not get the ability to manipulate BPF spinlocks
directly.  Instead, it gains a new flag (<tt>BPF_F_LOCK</tt>) that can be
added to the <tt>BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM</tt> and <tt>BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM</tt>
operations to cause the spinlock contained within the indicated element to
be acquired for the duration of the operation.  Reading an element does not
reveal the contents of the spinlock field, and updating an element will not
change that field.
<p>
One implication of this design is that user space cannot use BPF spinlocks
to protect complex changes to structures stored in BPF maps; even the
simple counter-incrementing example shown above would not be possible,
since the lock cannot be held over the full operation (reading the counter,
incrementing it, and storing the result).  The implicit assumption seems to be
that such manipulations will be done on the BPF side, so the locking
functionality serves mostly to keep user space from accessing a structure
that a BPF program has partially modified.  For example, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190131234012.3712779-10-ast@kernel.org/">a test
program</a> included with the patch set includes a BPF portion that
repeatedly picks a random value, then sets every element of an array to
that value while holding the lock.  The user-space side reads that array
under lock and verifies that all elements are the same, thus showing that
the element was not read in the middle of an update operation.
<p>
The patch set has seen a number of changes as the result of review
comments.  One significant added restriction is that BPF spinlocks cannot
be used in tracing or socket-filter programs due to preemption-related
issues.  Those restrictions seem likely to be lifted in the future, but
other types of BPF programs (including most networking-related programs)
should be able to use BPF spinlocks once the feature goes upstream.
<p>
<h4>The BPF memory model</h4>
<p>
In the conversation around <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190124041403.2100609-1-ast@kernel.org/">version 4 of the
patch set</a>, Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190124180109.GA27771@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">asked</a>
about the overall memory model for BPF.  In contemporary systems, there
is a lot more to concurrency control than spinlocks, especially when the
desire is to minimize the cost of that control.  Access to shared data can
be complicated by the tendency of modern hardware to cache and reorder
memory accesses, with the result that changes made on one CPU can appear in
a different order elsewhere.  Concurrency-aware code may have to make
careful use of memory barriers to ensure that changes are globally visible
in the right order.
<p>
Such code tends to be tricky when written for a single architecture, but it
is further complicated by the fact that,
naturally, every CPU type handles these concurrency issues differently.
Kernel developers have done a lot of work to hide those
differences to the greatest extent possible; details of that work can be
found in <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt">Documentation/memory-barriers.txt</a>
and the formal <a href="/Articles/718628/">kernel memory-model
specification</a>.  All of that work refers to kernel code running natively
on the host processor, though, not code running under the BPF virtual
machine.  As BPF programs run in increasingly concurrent environments,
the need to specify the memory model under which they run will
grow.
<p>
Starovoitov, who remains the leader of the kernel's BPF efforts, has <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190126001725.roqqfrpysyljqiqx@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">proved
resistant</a> to defining the memory model under which BPF programs run:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	What I want to avoid is to define the whole execution ordering
	model upfront.  We cannot say that BPF ISA is weakly ordered like
	alpha.  Most of the bpf progs are written and running on x86. We
	shouldn't twist bpf developer's arm by artificially relaxing memory
	model.  BPF memory model is equal to memory model of underlying
	architecture.  What we can do is to make it bpf progs a bit more
	portable with smp_rmb instructions, but we must not force weak
	execution on the developer.
</div>
<p>
This approach concerns the developers who have gone to a lot of effort to
specify what the kernel's memory model should be in general; Will Deacon <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190130181100.GA18558@fuggles.cambridge.arm.com/">said
outright</a> that "<q>I don't think this is a good approach to take for
the future of eBPF</q>".  Paul McKenney has <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190130183618.GX4240@linux.ibm.com/">suggested</a> that
BPF should simply follow the memory model used by the rest of the kernel.
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190130195113.xyqre4sxasit6vpu@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">doesn't
want to do that</a>, though, saying "<q>tldr: not going to sacrifice
performance</q>".
<p>
That part of the conversation ended without any conclusions beyond a
suggestion to talk
further about the issue, either in a phone call or at an upcoming
conference.  It's not clear whether this off-list discussion has happened
as of this writing.  What seems clear, though, is that these issues are
better worked out soon rather than having to be managed in an
after-the-fact manner later on.  Concurrency issues are hard enough when
the underlying rules are well understood; they become nearly impossible
when different developers are assuming different rules and code
accordingly.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

For comparison, systemtap's design took concurrency controls into account from day 1.  The language is defined to be concurrency-safe.  The generated code automatically protects script-visible global variables (any mixture of scalars and arrays) with shared or exclusive locks (depending on reading/writing those vars).  All needed locks are taken at the beginning of a code block (probe handler = bpf event handler), which permit the blocks to run atomically.  Locks may timeout in case of deadlocks.  Simplicity &amp; safe concurrency.<br>

The proposed memory model --- use whatever the underlying architecture uses --- is a recipe for subtle bugs caused by people developing BPF programs on x86 and not bothering to think about other systems.<br>

If you have a bug in the locking for your BPF, might you accidentally read memory you shouldn't have access to? I remember hearing about a proposal for the Java memory model where if two threads simultaneously copied location A into B and B into A, both locations could end up containing an arbitrary value (processor predicts the value of A, copies it to B, copies it to A, and finds that its prediction matches the actual value of A). The designers of the proposal said that properly-written programs would use locking to avoid that, but someone else pointed out that improperly-written programs still shouldn't end up with the JVM's address space in a char[] variable.<br>

Honestly, the entire proposal is misguided. BPF shouldn't be exposing a memory model _at all_! Instead, it should provide non-blocking STM-like constructs as the user API and let the verifier and optimizer component translate these STM declarations into locking and atomics as appropriate for a specific architecture. Everyone here is talking about this issue as if it were an architecture and specification problem, but it's really a compiler problem.<br>

How does the GPL work with BPF programs? Will a large company such as Google be able to create BPF programs for the kernel without having to release their source code?<br>

You can create all you want. The question is whether they can distribute them, e.g. in Chrome for improved sandboxing.<br>
<p>
Given that there are multiple instances where, essentially, proprietary code is loaded into the kernel already, I don't think licensing will give anybody any headaches.<br>

BPF programs contain a 'license' string (in their .data); the kernel checks whether this matches a small set of GPL-ey strings, and uses that to gate access to certain helper functions.  Essentially it's much like EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), except that I think proprietary BPF programs don't taint the kernel (since in theory the verifier means that they can't break anything but themselves).<br>

The discussion is very interesting! Is there any ongoing or recent effort or interest to define a memory model for eBPF? I look forward to your response.<br>

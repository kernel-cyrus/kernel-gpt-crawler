<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
John Garry and Ted Ts'o led a discussion about supporting atomic writes for buffered
I/O, without any torn (or partial) writes to the device, at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  It is something of a
continuation of a <a href="/Articles/933015/">discussion at last year's
summit</a>. The goal is to help PostgreSQL, which writes its data using
16KB buffered I/O; it currently has to do a lot of extra work to ensure
that its data is safe on disk.  A promise of non-torn, 16KB buffered writes
would allow the database 
to avoid doing double writes.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/974952/">

alt="[John Garry]" title="John Garry" width=204 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Garry began by going over the problem being solved; databases generally
write their data in chunks larger than the block size of the block device
(which is generally the same as the page size of the system, 4KB).  MySQL
and PostgreSQL both use larger chunks, up to 16KB. They need to ensure
the persistence of these chunks, in full,  in order to maintain an
uncorrupted database. 
MySQL uses direct I/O, which is generally able to ensure that 16KB is
either fully written, or not written at all, on today's storage hardware.
</p>

<p>
The kernel does not guarantee atomic 16KB writes, even for direct I/O,
however.  So Garry has come up with a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240326133813.3224593-1-john.g.garry@oracle.com/">patch
set for supporting atomic block writes</a> (as well as one to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240429174746.2132161-1-john.g.garry@oracle.com/">add
the feature to XFS</a>).   Later in the session he said that there is
ongoing work to support the feature in ext4; he has also posted an <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240422143923.3927601-1-john.g.garry%40oracle.com/">RFC
patch set for buffered atomic writes</a>. 
</p>

<p>
In his patches, there is
a new <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt> flag for <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/writev.2.html"><tt>pwritev2()</tt></a>
that requests torn-write protection for the write, he said; there is a
corresponding flag for io_uring as well.  The <tt>RWF_SYNC</tt>
flag is still needed to guarantee persistence, though. The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
system call can be used to query some new fields to determine the minimum
and maximum atomic sizes supported, as well as the maximum number of atomic
segments allowed for a given write operation.  All of those values are
dependent on the underlying filesystem, block-layer, and storage-device
limitations.
</p>

<p>
In order to make a call using <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt>, the total length must be a
power of two, between the minimum and maximum, be "naturally aligned", and
the write must
have an <tt>iov_count</tt> no more than the maximum number of segments.
Damien Le Moal asked whether this feature required hardware support in
order to ensure persistence with <tt>RWF_SYNC</tt>; Garry
said that it did.
Hannes Reinecke asked what was meant by "naturally aligned offset"; Garry said
that it means aligning an 8KB write on an 8KB boundary, 16KB on 16KB, and
so on. 
</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>
Both SCSI and NVMe support torn-write protection, Garry continued, but they
do it differently.  NVMe implicitly does atomic writes; there is no
dedicated command to request them.  Devices have a limit and if the write
is less than that, and does not cross the device-specific atomic-write
boundary, if any, it will be written atomically.  
SCSI has a separate command and more constraints; unlike NVMe, though,
atomic writes that do not meet the requirements are rejected.
Reinecke asked whether it made sense to merge BIOs in an atomic-write
request; Garry said that they will not be merged if the combination cannot
be done as an atomic write. 
</p>

<p>
The XFS support adds a new <tt>FORCEALIGN</tt> inode flag that can be set
via an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
command, which forces
the file to be aligned on certain boundaries.  That can be used to ensure that
file extents are 16KB-aligned, for example,  on a per-inode basis.

</p>

<a href="/Articles/974953/">

alt="[Ted Ts'o]" title="Ted Ts'o" width=199 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Ts'o said that the cloud vendors are already advertising torn-write
protection for MySQL; they are using ext4 with particular settings on
devices that can provide that protection. But there are "lots of sharp
edges"; 
the vendors have to audit the code paths and hope that a kernel update does not break them in some
way, since the kernel makes no guarantees.  The feature can provide a 60-100%
improvement in database performance, he said, because MySQL can avoid doing
a double write, which makes it attractive.
</p>

<p>
He said that the database developers want write requests that are only ever torn
at 16KB boundaries.  With the atomic-write support, kernel
developers are trying to do better than that, but it is important to ensure
that the huge performance gain does not get diminished or lost in the
process.  For example, the database might send a contiguous 256KB write,
but the only 
thing the developers are looking for is to know if the I/O fails for some
reason and that the failure can only happen at 16KB boundaries.  It is
important to remember that the database developers want "untorn writes";
guaranteeing more with atomic writes is fine, Ts'o said, as long as it comes
for free.
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner said that XFS added atomic writes ten years ago, which doubled
MySQL performance, so the effects of this kind of change have been known
for a long time.  Garry said that the term "atomic" is used for the
feature, because that is what the hardware vendors call it, but that it is
providing the "untorn writes" that database developers want.  Matthew Wilcox
noted that NVMe is specified to have 16KB tear boundaries; he wondered if
the SCSI vendors could be convinced into doing something similar.  But
Martin Petersen wanted to know what problems there were with the current
SCSI semantics; there are differences with NVMe, but he is unsure why they
are a problem.  It turned out that the currently proposed implementation
for atomic writes does not need to use everything that SCSI
provides, so it is not clear whether there are any actual deficiencies.
</p>

<h4>Buffered I/O</h4>

<p>
Ts'o said that the buffered I/O piece is where this all gets interesting.
The proposed API works great for direct I/O, because right after the call
to <tt>pwritev2()</tt>, the I/O is actually done to the device.  For
buffered I/O, that is not the case, since everything is going through the
page cache, which means that the write may not actually happen for "30
seconds or until user space calls <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fdatasync.3p.html"><tt>fdatasync()</tt></a>".
The reason for caring about buffered I/O is because PostgreSQL uses it;
depending on who you talk to, it will be three to six years before
the database can switch to using direct I/O.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem is that using the proposed API means keeping track of
which writes were done using the atomic flag.  If a 64KB write is done,
then a 16KB write, both with the flag, they need to be tracked separately.
There has also been talk of a hybrid mode, he said, where a
non-atomic-aware application can also write to the file in a non-aligned
way such that "things don't blow up".  The problem has become
over-constrained; <tt>pwritev2()</tt> is fine for direct I/O, but does not
really fit with what the database developers are asking for in the buffered
I/O case.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple ways to create an interface for buffered I/O, Ts'o said.
It could be an inode-based write granularity, set with something like the
XFS <tt>FORCEALIGN</tt> flag, an <tt>ioctl()</tt>
command, or <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html"><tt>fcntl()</tt></a>
operation.  Then there is a question of whether to stick with the
<tt>pwritev2()</tt> interface, which is more powerful than what is needed,
or, perhaps, to require that the application using buffered I/O only do
atomic writes at the granularity specified.
That would mean that the
kernel does not have to track various in-flight atomic-write sizes.
Another way to do that might be to require that the size of the folio used
for the write specifies the granularity.  
</p>

<p>
An attendee said that with buffered I/O, there is no way for the
application to get an error if the write fails.  Ts'o said that any error
would come when <tt>fdatasync()</tt> is called, which the attendee called
"buffered in name only".  But Ts'o said that it is how PostgreSQL works
today; it does multiple buffered writes, then calls <tt>fdatasync()</tt> to
make that data persistent and to detect if there are any problems.  The
developers understand that model and it is the documented POSIX interface.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara suggested that instead of tracking different sizes of atomic
writes, a single size could be tracked; if another write comes in with a
different size, the earlier writes could be flushed out.  In his RFC, Garry
said, the granularity was effectively set by the <tt>FORCEALIGN</tt>
size. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of the SCSI semantics with respect to whether
reads were synchronized with writes, and whether that means an atomic read
operation is also needed.  The answer seemed to be that no atomic read was needed.  But, because SCSI
has separate write commands for atomic versus non-atomic, there does need
to be some kind of indication from user space about the kind of I/O it
expects.  That could be done with a flag on the inode or folio.
</p>

<p>
Chinner suggested that the page-cache code could interpret these flags and
implement writethrough for writes of that sort.  It could be implemented
using the direct I/O code, so that those kinds of writes are not truly
buffered.  But Garry said that the tricky piece is handling a mixture of
atomic and non-atomic writes on the same folio.
</p>

<p>
The only reason an application would be using atomic writes, though, is for
performance, Chinner said.  Trying to support both types of writes,
including non-aligned writes, does not make any sense.  It comes down to a
question of whether it is an error to mix the two types of writing for the
same file, Ts'o said, or if there is a call to <tt>pwritev2()</tt> with the
wrong alignment; there is a need to clearly define what the semantics are.
</p>

<p>
Kara asked about the impact of these changes on the database code.  Ts'o
said that he believes the PostgreSQL developers are looking forward to a
solution, so 
they are willing to make the required changes when the time comes.  They
are likely to backport those changes to earlier versions of PostgreSQL as
well.  Wilcox said that probably did not matter, because the older versions
of PostgreSQL are running on neolithic kernels.  Ts'o said that is not
necessarily the case since some customers are willing to upgrade their
kernel, but require sticking with the older database system.
</p>

<p>
The discussion trailed off at that point so any further progress will
presumably come
on the mailing list.

<p>
My understanding is that in order to support this filesystem either needs to append some sort of checksum to each write like this and "waste" full block per such write. Or do write of data, then fsync, then write of metadata, then fsync again. So kinda close to double-writes they're trying to optimize-away in DBMS-es. Either way, it costs more.<br>
<p>
So using hardware still seems like more attractive proposition. Unless I am missing something.<br>

<p>
If you only want the filesystem to get out of the way of writing directly to your block device, yes.  But you are missing some things.<br>
<p>
The average cost isn't necessarily the worst case cost.  The checksum blocks can be amortized across multiple data blocks, if the application follows the pattern "it does multiple buffered writes, then calls fdatasync() to make that data persistent and to detect if there are any problems."  Efficiency depends on the amount of data batched up before fdatasync.  There's no rule that says the metadata write has to go to the same device as the data write in a cow filesystem, which may affect the cost analysis (i.e. even in the one-data-one-metadata-block-write case, one of the writes may be much cheaper than the other).<br>
<p>
API-level compatibility is sometimes more important than the performance.  Do we want to force application developers to implement two backends for cow- and non-cow filesystems, by failing in cases where there is no direct hardware support?  Or do we prefer a model like "use a thin filesystem if the hardware supports atomic writes, or use a cow filesystem if not", and keep only the backend that uses atomic writes?  If there's already an ioctl associated with this, it seems we could have one that says what we can expect from the backend (no support, emulated software support, full hardware support, or "one or more of the lower block layers does not implement this ioctl").  I don't expect PostgreSQL to drop non-atomic-write backends any time soon, but new projects might not bother supporting the old ways if some other part of the system will do the work for them.<br>
<p>
Administrator controls are sometimes more important than performance.  e.g. if we bought all the good hardware we can, and we still need to buy more, we can end up with some terrible storage devices.  The sysadmin might force all applications to run on a cow filesystem with checksums so that device failures (particularly unreported data corruption) can be detected.  That covers "data integrity is more important than performance" too.<br>
<p>
Filesystems that have checksums can verify writes long after the fact, and cow filesystems can do write ordering cheaply.  In some use cases that makes the fdatasync unnecessary (most of the same cases where async commit would be acceptable in the database).  We'd still want to make sure the some obscure part of the kernel doesn't try to merge writes in a way that ends up tearing or reordering them before they get to the filesystem.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Matthew Wilcox noted that NVMe is specified to have 16KB tear boundaries; he wondered if the SCSI vendors could be convinced into doing something similar</span><br>
<p>
I don't think NVMe in general guarantees anything up to that size, I suspect there might have been some miscommunication somewhere. <br>
<p>
See 2.1.4.1 - 2.1.4.2.1 in <br>
<a href="https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM-Express-NVM-Command-Set-Specification-1.0d-2023.12.28-Ratified.pdf">https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM-Express-NVM...</a><br>
<p>
It imo is pretty clear that a 512 block formatted device may just guarantee that 512 bytes are written in a tear free manner. To guarantee more, awupf would need to be &gt;= 1, which it very commonly isn't.<br>

I think Jake has written down exactly what I said, but that ends up being not what I meant without the surrounding context ;-)  We were talking about drives which specify an AWU / AWUPF that is 16KiB (whether that's block-size 4KiB and an AWUPF value of 3 or block-size 512 and an AWUPF of 31).<br>
<p>
Basically I was asking that since all implementations of this are cloud storage rather than drive firmware, whether we couldn't just have the cloud storage implement NVMe semantics even with the SCSI command set.  Martin doesn't see the need, and since I haven't worked on NVMe in about 12 years, I'm deferring to his expertise.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  MySQL and PostgreSQL both use larger chunks, up to 16KB.</span><br>
<p>
FWIW, with the default compilation options postgres just supports 8KB.  With non-default options 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 kB are supported for data pages (1-64 for WAL, but we don't need torn page protection there).<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  The reason for caring about buffered I/O is because PostgreSQL uses it; depending on who you talk to, it will be three to six years before the database can switch to using direct I/O. </span><br>
<p>
FWIW, if it were defined to be OK to use unbuffered IO for writes and buffered IO for reads, the timelines could be shortened considerably.  There'd not be concurrent reads and writes to the same pages due to postgres level interlocking.<br>
<p>
Realistically, there are workloads where we'll likely never be able to switch to unbuffered reads. Decent performance with unbuffered reads requires a well configured buffer pool size, which <br>
a) a lot of users won't configure<br>
b) doesn't work well with putting a lot of smaller postgres instances onto a system, which is common<br>
<p>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; An attendee said that with buffered I/O, there is no way for the application to get an error if the write fails. Ts'o said that any error would come when fdatasync() is called, which the attendee called "buffered in name only".</span><br>
<p>
I don't really understand the "buffered in name only" comment.<br>
<p>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Kara asked about the impact of these changes on the database code.</span><br>
<p>
From what I can tell, it'd not be particularly hard for postgres. There's some nastiness around upgrading a database that hasn't been created using FORCEALIGN, and thus couldn't guarantee that all existing data files are aligned.  To deal with that it'd be nice if we could specify on a per-write basis that we want an atomic write - if we get an error because of a file not being suitably aligned, we can fall back to the current method of protecting against torn writes.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  Ts'o said that he believes the PostgreSQL developers are looking forward to a solution, so they are willing to make the required changes when the time comes.</span><br>
<p>
Indeed. Our torn-write protection often ends up being the majority of the WAL volume.<br>
<p>
There's a small caveat in that we currently use full page writes to increase replay performance (we don't need to read the underlying data if we have the full new contents, thus the amount of ~random reads can be drastically reduced).<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; They are likely to backport those changes to earlier versions of PostgreSQL as well. </span><br>
<p>
I doubt we'd backport this to earlier PG versions - we tend to be very conservative with backporting features. With a very limited set of exceptions (e.g. to support easier/more efficient upgrades) we only backport bugfixes.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Wilcox said that probably did not matter, because the older versions of PostgreSQL are running on neolithic kernels. Ts'o said that is not necessarily the case since some customers are willing to upgrade their kernel, but require sticking with the older database system. </span><br>
<p>
Yea, that unfortunately is indeed common. It's not helped by the PG versions included in LTS distros being quite old. Lots of users get started on those and continue to use the PG version even when upgrading the OS.<br>

<h1>On reiserfs and external attributes</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 28, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="/Articles/81978/">The patch</a> seemed relatively straightforward;
Chris Mason had sent out a set of reiserfs changes which include
<tt>data=journal</tt> support, an improved block allocator, metadata
readahead, and external attribute support.  One of those changes, however,
does not sit well with Hans Reiser, the original creator of reiserfs.
<p>
External attributes are just a way of attaching extra metadata to files;
they are used for things like access control lists and SELinux context
information.  Most of the standard Linux filesystems support external
attributes in 2.6, but reiserfs does not yet have that capability.  Given that
features like SELinux will not work without external attributes, adding this
capability has been high on the wish lists of many users and developers.
<p>
When the external attribute patch was posted, however, Hans Reiser sent out
<a href="/Articles/82480/">a protest</a> asking that the patch not be
applied.  Those who have followed Hans's work over the years will know what
his objection is: external attributes live in their own name space.  Hans
has dedicated much effort to the task of moving everything into the
filesystem name space; he says:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The expressive power of an operating system is NOT proportional to
	the number of components, but instead is proportional to the number
	of possible connections between its components.  If you fragment
	the namespaces of an OS, you reduce each component to effective
	interactions with only those components in its reduced size
	namespace.  Designing the namespaces of an OS so that they possess
	closure and are unified may seem like a lot of effort, but it is
	very cost effective compared to building many times more other OS
	components to get the same expressive power.
</div>
<p>
The upcoming <a href="http://namesys.com/v4/v4.html">Reiser4 filesystem</a>
implements Hans's vision of how external attributes should be implemented;
essentially, each attribute just looks like a small file containing the
attribute value.  The solution is fast and elegant; it may well be the way
things are done in the future.  For the moment, however, there are a few
problems:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Reiser4 is still in beta testing, and has not yet been submitted for 
     inclusion into the 2.6 kernel.  Once it is submitted, it is not
     certain that it will be accepted quickly.
<p>
<li> The Reiser4 external attribute API is different from the API used in
     the 2.6 kernel.  Applications, to use this API, will have to be
     rewritten to use the special-purpose <tt>reiser4()</tt> system call.
<p>
<li> Some users of reiserfs ("Reiser3") might be a little nervous about
     making an immediate jump to a completely new filesystem.  They just
     might want to be able to continue using their existing filesystems
     and, simultaneously, make use of external attributes.
</ul>
<p>

The solution seems reasonably clear: Reiser4, once it's ready, can be
merged with its new ways of doing things.  The existing reiserfs
filesystem, meanwhile, can be augmented with the capabilities that its
users would like to have now.  This approach would seem to offer the best
of both worlds.  Mr. Reiser disagrees; he would rather not have (what he
sees as) an inelegant hack grafted onto reiserfs to satisfy immediate
needs.  When code is released as free software, however, not even its
creator can prevent its development in certain directions if that's what
its users want.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      In Linux development the maintainer doesn't have nearly as much control as many of them would like to think they do.<p>being a maintainer gives you the right to make suggestions and incoporate other peoples code, it doesn't give you the right to say 'this code will never go into the kernel' becouse Linus always maintains the right to change anything he thinks needs to be changed, and if a maintainer is on the wrong side of this decision to many times the maintainer changes, either voluntarily as the old maintainer gives up (stomps away indiscust, etc) of involuntarily as Linus accepts more and more patches from the new guy until the old maintainers patches no longer apply to the kernel.<p>it's happened before and it will happen again

      If I'm not mistaken, didn't Hans stir things up when he first came out with riserfs and tried to get it included in the kernel. Sort of upseting a lot of people. He's like the RMS of filesystems. Briliant, but inflexible.<p><br>

      That's hardly fair.  Here is an excerpt from what he said [1]: <br> <br>&quot;Not sure you want to ship a 3.0 without it. It is 50-150% faster than  <br> V3, which makes it a significant competitive advantage. I forget how  <br> much faster writes are, something well over 100% faster, and the newest  <br> version is faster yet.  <br>  <br> How do I put it. I'm the last straggler coming back from the hunt, and  <br> I've got what looks like it might be a wooly mammoth on my shoulders,  <br> and my tribesmen are complaining that I'm late for dinner. How about  <br> helping me by cutting down a tree for the roasting spit instead? Think  <br> thoughts of the poor hungry Microsoft tribe eating NTFS. <br> ... <br> Oh, and it has features too, not just performance...&quot; <br> <br>Yes, there was lengthy discussion and some disagreement about including <br>Reiser4 in the 2.6 kernel (which some thought would be 3.0), but it was <br>not an unreasonable request, and eventually got included on merit. <br> <br>I've always liked that &quot;straggler coming back from the hunt&quot; metaphor :-) <br> <br>[1] http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.3/0603.html

      Ouch. You can't have a more than 100% faster write -- it would complete before it's issued. ;-)  (Yeah, I know, he probably meant &gt;50%, i.e. that v3 is 100% slower than v4. I freely admit that nitpicking is fun.)<p>That being said, most programs could care less about which file system they're running on. Thus, uniformity of features is somewhat more important than purity.

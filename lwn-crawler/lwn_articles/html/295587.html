           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 26, 2008</br>
           </div>
Support for network namespaces - allowing different groups of processes to
have a different view of the system's network interfaces, routes, firewall
rules, etc. - is nearing completion in recent kernels.  A look at
<tt>net/Kconfig</tt> turns up something interesting, though: network
namespaces can only be enabled in kernels which do not support sysfs - the
two are mutually exclusive.  Since most system configurations need sysfs to
work properly, this limitation has made it harder than it would otherwise
be to use, or even test, the network namespace feature.
<p>
The problem is simple: the network subsystem creates a sysfs directory for
each network interface on the system.  For example, <tt>eth0</tt> is
represented by <tt>/sys/class/net/eth0</tt>; therein one can find out just
about anything about how <tt>eth0</tt> is configured, query its packet
statistics, and more.  But, when network namespaces are in use, one group
of processes may have a different <tt>eth0</tt> than another, so they
cannot share a globally-accessible sysfs tree.  One solution might be to
add the network namespace as an explicit level in the sysfs tree, but that
would break user-space tools and fails to properly isolate namespaces from
each other.  The real solution is to build namespace awareness more deeply
into sysfs.
<p>

Eric Biederman has been working on a set of sysfs namespace patches for the
last year or so; those patches now appear to be getting close to ready for
inclusion into the mainline.  Network namespaces will be the first user of
this feature, but it has been written in a way that makes it possible for
any system namespace to provide differing views of parts of the sysfs
hierarchy.
<p>

The core concept is that of a "tagged" directory in sysfs.  Any sysfs
directory can be associated with (at most) one type of tag, where that type
identifies which type of namespace controls how that directory is viewed.
Thus, for example, <tt>/sys/class/net</tt> would have a tag type
identifying the network namespace subsystem as the one which is in control
there.  The <tt>/sys/kernel/uids</tt> directory, instead, will be managed
by the user namespace subsystem.
Once a directory is given a tag type, all subdirectories and
attribute files inherit the same type.
<p>
Namespace code makes use of tagged sysfs directories by adding an entry to
<tt>enum sysfs_tag_type</tt>, defined in <tt>&lt;linux/sysfs.h&gt;</tt>, to
identify its specific tag type.
The namespace must also create an operations structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct sysfs_tag_type_operations {
	const void *(*mount_tag)(void);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The purpose of the <tt>mount_tag()</tt> method is to return a specific tag
(represented by a <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> pointer) for the <tt>current</tt>
process.  This tag, normally, will just be a pointer to the structure
describing the relevant namespace; for example, network namespaces
implement this method as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    static const void *net_sysfs_mount_tag(void)
    {
	return current-&gt;nsproxy-&gt;net_ns;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The tag operations must be registered with sysfs using:
<p>
<pre>
    int sysfs_register_tag_type(enum sysfs_tag_type type, 
                                struct sysfs_tag_type_operations *ops);
</pre>
<p>
Thereafter, there are two ways of associating tags with a sysfs hierarchy.
One of those is to make a tagged directory directly with:
<p>
<pre>
    int sysfs_make_tagged_dir(struct kobject *kobj, 
                              enum sysfs_tag_type type);
</pre>
<p>
The directory associated with <tt>kobj</tt> will have differing contents
depending on the value of the tag of the given <tt>type</tt>.  The actual
tag associated with the contents of this directory will be determined (at
creation time) by calling a new function added to the <tt>kobj_type</tt>
structure:
<p>
<pre>
    const void *(*sysfs_tag)(struct kobject *kobj);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>sysfs_tag()</tt> function is usually a short series of
<tt>container_of()</tt> calls which, eventually, locates the appropriate
namespace for the given <tt>kobj</tt>.
<p>
An alternative way to attach tags to a directory tree is to associate it
directly with the <tt>class</tt> structure.  To that end, <tt>struct
class</tt> has two new members:
<p>
<pre>
    enum sysfs_tag_type tag_type;
    const void *(*sysfs_tag)(struct device *dev);
</pre>
<p>
When the class is instantiated, it will have tags of the given
<tt>tag_type</tt>; the specific tag for a given class will be found by
calling the <tt>sysfs_tag()</tt> function.
<p>
Finally, if a specific tag ceases to be valid (because the associated
namespace is destroyed, normally), a call should be made to:
<p>
<pre>
    void sysfs_exit_tag(enum sysfs_tag_type type, const void *tag);
</pre>
<p>
This call will cause all sysfs directories with the given <tt>tag</tt> to
become invisible, and to be deleted when it is safe to do so.
<p>
Adding tagged directory support requires some significant changes to the
sysfs code.  But the interface has been designed to make it very easy for
other subsystems to make use of tagged directories; it's a simple matter of
providing functions to return the specific tag values which should be
used.  At this point, the biggest challenge might be making sense of sysfs
when its contents may be different for each observer.  But that is a
challenge associated with namespaces in general.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Uninformed question:<br>
<p>
Roughly how close are we to having fully working, usable namespaces in mainline kernel?<br>
<p>
By «fully working, usable» I mean a setup where you can run multiple fake operating systems under the same actual kernal, each one with their own init process, each one running a different set of services. Basically everything you do today using Xen, but at a higher speed and with lower memory overhead and without the option of running different kernel versions on different systems.<br>

We are working on supporting this in libvirt's "LXC" driver (LinuX Containers). This driver uses the clone() syscall along with the new CLONE_NEW{PID,UTS,USER,NS,IPC,NET} flags to create a container that is isolated from the "host" operating system.<br>
<p>
There are roughly two ways of using this capability<br>
<p>
 - Workload isolation for applications. The application shares the same root filesystem as the host, perhaps with a few extra mounts points and custom networking.<br>
<p>
 - Security isolation for applications. The application has a totally isolated private root filesystem, custom networking, etc - nothing is shared with the host OS.<br>
<p>
As of 2.6.26, only the workload isolation use case is usable. Well, actually not quite true, we can do the private root filesystem too, but it is not secure because we're lacking some kernel capabilities still. For workload management we will be integrating with cgroups to control CPU/memory/etc limits<br>
<p>
For the security isolation use case to be usable in real world, the sysfs namespace patch is one of the core missing pieces. The second is device namespace - so the nodes in /dev/ and /dev/pts inside the container are separated from those of the host OS. It is not clear what the timeframe on this latter capability is going to appear. If it appears before 2.6.29 i'd be surprised...<br>

Note that there's a different variation that might be useful (and might be complete either before or after that): being able to have different users see a partially different system. For example, giving each non-root user a different /tmp directory (subdirectories of the real /tmp). It would also be possible to have a single machine with multiple heads, where each of these would appear as the only (or, at least, main) head; if you plug a USB mouse into the USB hub built into your monitor, it controls your pointer and not anybody else's, for example, and you own the auto-mount of the USB memory stick you plug in. And it might be nice to be able to have a developer on a shared system able to run an instance of postgres that seems to that user to be system-wide, but is actually private, without the postgres processes able to tell that they're not system-wide.<br>

From a high level it looks something like:<br>
- The last couple of bugs with signal handling and init<br>
  fixed in the pid namespace<br>
<p>
- sysfs<br>
<p>
- The uid namespace<br>
<p>
If you are someone who can take less than perfection you can build<br>
a better chroot today.<br>
<p>
I'm hoping once the current round of changes settles out we<br>
can get a chroot like tool out to people so non-experts can<br>
start using this code.<br>
<p>
The short term goal is not to be a Xen replacement but to correctly<br>
implement the namespaces we have and to do something useful.  Which<br>
basically amounts to building a better chroot, and to start reducing<br>
the differences between vserver and openVZ.<br>

I find myself wondering if these containers are nestable.<br>
<p>
That is, the whole reason we need any virtualisation is applications (whole working systems) expect something which strongly resembles a single Linux box.  Virtualisation provides that illusion, while isolating the application.<br>
<p>
In the old days, it was enough to use 'processes' and 'directories' :-)<br>
But applications grew, and did cleverer things like configure their own firewalls and virtual networks, and decided they really depend on a thing which looks strongly like a single Linux box.<br>
<p>
Pretty soon, someone is going to decide that these containers are really neat, that you can put Apache in one, DNS in another, SMTP in another, etc., and build whole working systems like that.<br>
<p>
Then someone else is going to want to take that working system, and run _that_ in a container... Will it work?  Will the containers nest?<br>

Yes.  The in kernel solutions are nestable.  The out of tree solutions like OpenVZ and Vserver appear to have architecture limits that keeps them from nesting today.<br>

At work for various reason, I needed to change the VLAN tag used on one board, but the name of the virtual interface in Linux is eth0.&lt;tag&gt; which means that every part of our software which stored the name of the interface had to be modified: not good.<br>
<p>
I asked if it was possible to create virtual interfaces with a 'logical name' independently of the value of the tag, but this isn't possible..<br>
<p>
Oh well, at least Linux isn't naming the interfaces by the name of the HW maker as *BSD do I think, otherwise it'd be even worse..<br>

ip link set eth0.tag name something_fixed<br>

Hard coding your interface names in general is a bad idea<br>
but linux can very much rename network interfaces allowing<br>
you to give them a logical name.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 2, 2007</br>
           </div>
The Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel is a security module
designed to harden Linux systems through the addition of mandatory access
control policies; it was <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/244531/">covered here</a> last August.  Like
SELinux, SMACK works by attaching labels to processes, files, and other
system objects and implementing rules describing what kinds of access are
allowed by specific combinations of labels.  Unlike SELinux, though, SMACK
was designed specifically for simplicity of administration.
<p>
The posting of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/252378/">version 3 of the
SMACK patch</a> inspired a certain amount of discussion.  <a
href="/Articles/252568/">Andrew Morton's take</a> led things off:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I don't know enough about security even to be dangerous.  I went
	back and reviewed the August thread from your version 1 submission
	and the message I take away is that the code has been well-received
	and looks good when considered on its own merits, but selinux could
	probably be configured to do something sufficiently similar.
<p>
	I'd have trouble declaring that "but" to be a reason to not merge smack.
	I'm more thinking "let's merge it and see if people use it".
</div>
<p>
Andrew concluded by suggesting that the SMACK patch should be merged for
2.6.24.  There was some discussion about specific pieces of the patch (some
developers are more impressed by CIPSO network labels than others), but
there does not seem to be a whole lot of opposition to merging the SMACK
security module.  It is generally seen as being well-written code which
makes sense from a security point of view.
<p>
There was one predictable exception, though: whenever a new security module
is considered for merging the SELinux developers tend to oppose it.  This
time, James Morris voiced <a
href="/Articles/252569/">a more general complaint</a>: SMACK would become the second
in-kernel user of the Linux security module (LSM) framework.  That, in
turn, would make it almost impossible to remove LSM from the kernel.  James
claims:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If LSM remains, security will never be a first class citizen of the
	kernel.  Application developers will see multiple security schemes,
	and either burn themselves trying to support them, or more likely,
	ignore them.  Core kernel developers will continue to not have
	enough information to understand what the LSM hooks in their code
	are supposed to be doing, leading to long term maintenance issues
	and potential security problems.
</div>
<p>
The SELinux programmers, it seems, would rather that SELinux became the one
security framework supported by Linux, with all development effort going
into making SELinux better.
<p>
The problem, of course, is that, even after a few years with only SELinux
in the kernel, there has not been a glut of application developers working
to support it.  The vision of each application shipping with an SELinux
policy file has not come to be.  Some progress has been made in the creation of
higher-level tools for the management of SELinux policies, and the Fedora
and Red Hat developers have come a long way toward making a general-purpose
distribution work with a limited set of SELinux policies, but SELinux
simply remains too complex for most people to deal with.  SELinux may work
out of the box on an RHEL system, but as soon as the system administrator
runs into something which breaks, chances are that SELinux will be turned
off.
<p>

The SELinux developers would presumably argue that the way to address these
problems is to focus on a single security framework within the kernel.
Rather than create competing, simplified frameworks, it would be better to
implement approaches like AppArmor or SMACK within SELinux and, in the
process, make SELinux better.  Those
developers <a href="/Articles/252587/">argue</a> that pluggable security
modules, like pluggable schedulers, succeed only in splitting development
effort and preventing the creation of a truly general solution:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Do you really want to encourage people to roll their own security
	module rather than working toward a common security architecture
	and a single balanced solution (which doesn't necessarily mean
	SELinux, mind you, but certainly could draw from parts of it)?  As
	with pluggable schedulers, the LSM approach prevents cross
	pollination and forces users to make poor choices.
</div>
<p>
The answering argument is that there are many security
environments and differing sets of user needs; there is no sign that a
single security approach can ever 
work in all situations.  And, even if such a unified approach were
possible, getting security developers to agree on it would still be a major
challenge. 
Ted Ts'o <a href="/Articles/252588/">writes</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The real problem with security is that there are no "hard numbers",
	as Linus puts it.  Instead, there are different sets of
	requirements in terms of what is a valid threat model --- which
	will very depending on the environment and how the servers are
	deployed, and what the capabilities are of the adversary trying to
	penetrate said system --- and how end users are willing to
	compromise between security and convenience.
</div>
<p>
The LSM architecture was a result of <a
href="http://lwn.net/2001/features/KernelSummit/">the very first kernel
summit</a>, where
Linus stated that he had no wish to choose between the various security
ideas in circulation and, instead, wanted the kernel to be able to support
all of them.  He has not changed his mind since; he still doesn't see any
imminent consensus on security approaches, and still wants Linux to be
flexible in this regard.  So <a href="/Articles/252589/">his
pronouncement</a> was:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So LSM stays in. No ifs, buts, maybes or anything else.
<p>
	When I see the security people making sane arguments and agreeing
	on something, that will change. Quite frankly, I expect hell to
	freeze over before that happens, and pigs will be nesting in
	trees. But hey, I can hope.
</div>
<p>

So it looks like the way is clear for a merger of SMACK in 2.6.24.  Once
that happens, it would not be surprising to see another push made by the
developers of security modules like AppArmor and TOMOYO Linux; in fact, the
<a href="/Articles/252652/">TOMOYO Linux patches</a> have just been
reposted.  In the end, SELinux will, despite the apparent wishes of its
developers, have to compete with other security approaches for attention
from developers, distributors, and users.  There will be no One True
Security Module for Linux in the foreseeable future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It seems like the SELinux guys are still looking to userspace tools to bail them out of their usability nightmare.  I'm guessing most Linux admins enter iptables commands by hand (or by script), and iptables is *way* simpler than SELinux.  The ALSA guys leaned on userspace to bail them out of their complexity nightmare and look at where it got them.<br>
<p>
As long as it takes *days* for a good admin to learn and provision a nontrivial SELinux server, SELinux is a non-starter (in my workshop anyway).  Ignore the userspace tools!  Make a portion of SELinux as capable and easy to use as AppArmor or SMACK and SELinux adoption will increase tenfold.<br>
<p>
I'm excited about SMACK.  I hope it gets merged.  And I hope SELinux guys start taking learnability and usability seriously.<br>

      It depends on what policy you use. For example, the Simplified Policy Description Language is quite easy to grok:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://seedit.sourceforge.net/">http://seedit.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
<p>
It's policy language looks a lot like AppArmor's, but it does use file contexts underneath.<br>

So, interestingly, is not *Novell* to blame (rather than SELinux or the casual user) to not have AppArmor designed to use SELinux as LSM? Just a thought...<br>

      AppArmor predates SELinux, and does things that SELinux can't do without <br>
insane delays (mass-relabelling of potentially every file in a very deep <br>
subdirectory whenever you rename it springs to mind; even crazier <br>
mass-relabellings of everything on the disk to implement some changes of <br>
policy, unless I miss my guess).<br>
<p>
(Equally, AppArmor can't efficiently imitate a TE system --- but nobody's <br>
claiming it can.)<br>

      I think the problem here is, we're getting conflicting messages from the SELinux folks.  On the one hand, they insist that SELinux is a security architecture, and can be used to create higher-level, more abstract security tools.  On the other hand, they insist that SELinux should be usable as-is from userspace, by ordinary administrators.<br>
<p>
I don't see these positions as compatible at all.  And while I am no expert with SELinux (aside from the developers, does such a thing exist?), from what I understand about it, it IS more suited as an architecture for building security tools, than as a security tool in its own right.  So perhaps the SELinux folks should work on making its interface more of a "programmatic" one, and stop emphasizing the userspace tools as security solutions on their own.  In other words, to compare to another Linux subsystem, SELinux would be Netfilter to other tools' iptables or shorewall.<br>

      Well I think the point behind Eclispe is that it's a framework for building IDEs and what IDE you get when you try it out is only going to have a tiny fraction of it's capabilties.<br>
<p>
Er, something like that.<br>
<p>
Personally I'm happy with Vim and Python. No need for intellesense or anything like that for a language that is designed to be easy to remember and I am not working in a formal corporate environment. (I'll probably just program in C or pyrex or something like that if I need speed)<br>

      <p>Agreed!  Drag's comment about his &quot;IDE&quot; of vim and python vs. Eclipse did indeed bear some resemblance to the discussion about SELinux vs. AppArmour.  What a pleasantly surreal experience!</p>

<p>Thanks to Drag's misplaced comment, I just had a bright idea: Eclipse IDE for SELinux!!  Use all the features you've come to expect with using Eclipse to develop Java, C, or C++... and now you can build your own security framework!  Testing your framework is simply a few mouse clicks away via the &quot;build/debug&quot; menu.</p>

<p>&lt;/end silliness&gt; ;-)</p>

      Obviously the *right* approach is an Emacs specialized entirely for writing SELinux configurations. There's even an XEmacs fork with the right name: SXEmacs. Just reuse the name, write a new selinux mode, rip out all that boring stuff nobody uses like text-mode, cc-mode, vm and gnus, and you're home free! :)<br>

      See SELinux Policy IDE aka <a HREF="http://oss.tresys.com/projects/slide">SLIDE</a>.
It may not be the full embodiment of your dream, but its a starting point. ;-)

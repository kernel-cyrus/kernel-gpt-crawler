Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
The CPU idle ("cpuidle") code has one of those tasks that would be best
handled with absolute knowledge of the future: knowing how long the
processor will be idle 
so that the most appropriate sleep state can be chosen.  Since that
knowledge is hard to come by, the cpuidle code must get by with heuristics.
At the 2014 Linux 
Plumbers Conference (LPC), Daniel Lezcano talked about a scheme he has to improve
those heuristics and, in the process, bring about better integration
between the scheduler and the cpuidle subsystem.
<p>
The current cpuidle code suffers from a number of shortcomings.  It is not
actually tied to the scheduler, so it has no idea of what the scheduler
plans to do next.  Even the most sophisticated governors tend to get things
wrong, leading to the wrong sleep states being chosen.  By focusing on a
few relatively predictable parameters, Daniel hopes to come up with an
approach to cpuidle that is both simpler and more accurate.
<p>
The "menu" cpuidle governor used on many systems looks at the recent past
and tries to come up with a good guess as to how long the system will sleep
the next time it goes idle.  But actual system behavior depends on a wide
variety of different events.  Some, like timer expirations, are entirely
predictable.  Others, such as block I/O operations, are reasonably

<a href="/Articles/618125/"><img

align="right"></a> 

predictable, especially if one is watching carefully.  Others, including
things like keyboard events, are not predictable at all.  Including these
latter events in the calculation, Daniel said, leads to bad predictions and
erratic performance from the cpuidle governor.
<p>
Daniel's <a href="/Articles/617598/">cpuidle patch set</a> addresses the
most predictable wakeup events by having the scheduler pass the next timer
expiration time into the cpuidle code.  The scheduler also passes in the
current latency requirement; cpuidle can use that information to avoid
putting the processor into an overly deep sleep.  The most unpredictable
events, instead, are simply ignored in this version of the cpuidle code.
<p>
That leaves the moderately predictable events, primarily block I/O.
Daniel's patch set starts by maintaining a simple running average of
per-task I/O completion times.  All tasks waiting for block I/O on a given
CPU are put into a <a href="/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a>; the
closest expected completion time is 
easily obtained from that tree and used to predict the next wakeup time.
But the running average is a bit too simple, being overly affected by the
occasional operation that takes much longer (or much less time) than
expected.  So something a bit more complex is called for.
<p>
Daniel's response is to divide I/O completion times into buckets; after
some investigation, he settled on 200µs as the optimal bucket granularity.
Each bucket contains a counter of "hits," being the number of times that an
operation has fallen into that bucket's duration.  
The buckets tracking I/O completion times are stored in a linked list.
When a process first starts up, the data structure might look something
like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cpuidle-buckets.png" width=483 height=62
alt="[cpuidle bucket data structure]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
The "hits" counter is incremented in the appropriate bucket for each I/O
operation completion.  After a small number of operations, the data
structure might look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cpuidle-buckets2.png" width=483 height=62
alt="[cpuidle bucket data structure]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
Something interesting happens every time one bucket gains five hits 
though: it is moved to the beginning of the list.  So, if the next
operation completes in just over 200µs, the data structure will look like
this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cpuidle-buckets3.png" width=483 height=62
alt="[cpuidle bucket data structure]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
The idea is that the buckets that see the most activity will be found
toward the beginning of the list.  When it comes time to predict when the
next operation will complete, Daniel's code iterates through the list,
computing a score for each bucket.  Essentially, that score is the number
of hits in the bucket divided by 1+2<i>p</i>, where <i>p</i> is the
bucket's position in the list.  So the bucket in the second position must
have three times as many hits to get a higher score than the bucket in the
first position.
<p>
The idea is to try to guess the most likely completion time based on both
long-term and recent history.  According to Daniel, it works pretty well,
yielding far better results than the existing menu governor.  Even so, this
design did not survive the discussion in the LPC microconference, so any
version of this patch set that gets into the mainline kernel is likely to
look somewhat different.
<p>
The issue was the use of a per-task data structure for I/O completion time
tracking.  The advantage of this approach is that, when a task moves
between CPUs, the tracking information will move with it, so the scheduler
on the new CPU has an immediate idea of how long that task's I/O operations
will take.  But I/O completion times are not really a task-specific
parameter; they are, instead, tied to the underlying device.  And, as it
happens, the kernel is already tracking device performance in the block
layer.  That information reflects current loads and should be quite
accurate; using it might enable the entire bucket data structure to be done
without.
<p>
So a future version of this patch set will probably be recast along those
lines, using the backing store information already maintained by the
kernel.  But there are other challenges looming for this code.  As Peter
Zijlstra pointed out, the block layer is increasingly trying to maintain
locality in I/O requests, ensuring that the CPU handling an I/O completion
is the one that initiated the operation.  Better locality makes sense,
Peter said, but it also can conflict with the scheduler's attempts at
distributing load across a system.  It is harder to guess at wakeup times
if it's not clear which CPU will wake up to deal with a specific I/O
completion.  The multiqueue block layer code is going to make this problem
worse; some work will have to be done to reconcile these differing
approaches to performance.
<p>
But, even if it is not a complete solution to the problem, Daniel's patch
achieves the goals of better sleep-time predictions and better integration
of the cpuidle code with the scheduler.  That should be sufficient to get
some version of this code into the mainline — someday.

      "relatively constant" in human time scales, but not if you are looking at sub-millisecond timings. Try:

<pre>
 #!/usr/bin/perl

 use Term::ReadKey;
 use Time::HiRes qw(gettimeofday tv_interval);

 ReadMode 'cbreak';
 my $k = ReadKey 0;
 my $t = [gettimeofday];
 while ($k ne "\n" &amp;&amp; $k ne "\r") {
     $k = ReadKey 0;
     my $tt = [gettimeofday];
     print tv_interval($t, $tt),"\n";
     $t = $tt;
 }
 ReadMode 0;
</pre>

For me standard deviation is about 100 ms -- much too jittery to rely on. Remember that the disk events are put in 0.2 ms buckets.
<p>
On the other hand, ignoring keypresses may be just the right thing to do. They happen so infrequently! If something more sophisticated is needed, try to find out if user is typing, then err on the side of caution and expect keypresses every 50ms.

Keyboard events are a poor example. If you delay the processing of a keyboard event by 50ms, there won't be much of an effect on the system. But for other sporadic events, like IO, or network, delaying the processing can significantly effect the throughput of the system.<br>

If you delay the processing of a keyboard event with 50 ms you suddenly have a 3 frame latency at 60 fps, and a 6 frame latency at the desired 120 fps that is needed for things like the Occulus rift.<br>
<p>
And trust me, you notice it when you get a 3 frame higher input latency than before. It's a very noticeable thing when you're in a game.<br>

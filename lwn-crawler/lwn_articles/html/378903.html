<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 16, 2010</br>
           </div>
Toward the end of the 2.6.33 development cycle, Linus <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/376029/">suggested</a> that he might make the
next merge window a little shorter than usual.  And, indeed, 2.6.34-rc1
came out on March&nbsp;8, twelve days after the 2.6.33 release.  A number
of trees got caught out in the cold as a result of that change, and that
appears to be a result that suits Linus just fine.
<p>
That said, some trees have been pulled after the -rc1 release.  These
include the trivial tree, with the usual load of spelling fixes and other
small changes.  There was a large set of ARM changes, including support for
a number of new boards and devices.  The memory usage controller got a new
threshold feature allowing for finer-grained control of (and information
about) memory usage.  And so on; all told, nearly 1,000 changes have been
merged (as of this writing) since the 2.6.34-rc1 release.
<p>
When <a href="/Articles/378907/">the final SCSI pull request</a> came
along, though, Linus found his moment to draw a line in the sand.  Linus,
it seems, is <a href="/Articles/378908/">getting a little tired</a> of what
he sees as last-minute behavior from some subsystem maintainers:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 I've told people before. The merge window is for _merging_, not
	 for doing development. If you send me something the last day, then
	 there is no "window" any more. And it is _really_ annoying to have
	 fifty pull requests on the last day. I'm not going to take it any
	 more.
</div>
<p>
So, Linus <a href="/Articles/378909/">says</a>, he plans to be even more
unpredictable in the future.  Evidently determinism in this part of the
process leads to behavior he doesn't like, so, in the future, developers
won't really be able to know how long the merge window will be.  In such an
environment, most subsystem maintainers will end up working as if the merge
window had been reduced to a single week - an idea which had been discussed
and rejected at the 2009 Kernel Summit.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's probably not really that big of a deal though. <br>
<p>
Nobody really uses Linus's tree directly anymore. At least the number of folks that do it are <br>
relatively small. <br>
<p>
People use distro-supplied kernels nowadays and if a distro decides to use a Linus branch kernel <br>
directly on it's first 'release' does not really deserve to have users due to their obvious stupidity.<br>

if the maintainers don't have their trees ready prior to th emerge window, how much testing do those trees actually get prior to being merged?<br>
<p>
Linus has made the same point about trees that  get re-based immediately prior to to the pull request.<br>
<p>
I suspect that by delaying such trees to the next merge window the tree will stabilize faster and end up shortening the time until the next full release.<br>

Can someone explain why is a one-day merge window a bad thing? Would it not work to have all maintainers asking Linus to merge the first day, even if the merge process proper took several days?<br>

Because someone is always on a business trip just that very moment, or something else. Mind you that travelling long distance (e.g. Tokyo--Paris) already takes 13 hours of the so-proposed merge day.<br>

I think the answer there may be a bit of queuing; let maintainers send in pull requests for future releases (fixing the contents of the pull) during the -rc7 or so timeframe, and just send reminders after. It obviously does nobody any good to test the reflexes of the maintainers.<br>
<p>
In the SCSI tree's case, there's the odd situation of the maintainer having a set of changes together slightly after the start of the merge window, as a result of getting pull requests in response to the release of the previous version. The maintainer was holding off on sending these on to Linus in order to try to get them some more exposure in -next before sending them to Linus. The proper procedural change may be more on the side of telling Linus (early) that there's something baking in -next, and let Linus put off merging it until it's more baked or skip it if it's not testing well.<br>

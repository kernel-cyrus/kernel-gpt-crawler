Jesper Dangaard Brouer has been <a href="/Articles/629155/">working on
improving networking performance</a> 
for some time.  When one is trying to process packets with a tight
per-packet time budget, every bit of overhead counts, and the overhead of
the memory allocator turns out to count quite a bit.  At the 2016 Linux
Filesystem, Storage, and Memory-Management Summit, he presented some ideas
he had for reducing that overhead.
<p>
One area of trouble is the DMA API, especially on PowerPC systems.  There,
the mapping and unmapping operations are expensive, and pages that have
been mapped for DMA must be considered read-only by the networking code.
Unfortunately, those pages must be written at times (to change an IP
address, for example), leading to expensive unmapping operations that,
perhaps, can even be destructive to the data in the buffer.
<p>
Jesper suggested that, instead, a set of pages could be kept permanently
mapped to the device and recycled when mapping requests are made.  The
pages could remain mapped, with the <tt>dma_sync_*</tt> functions used to
control whether the device or the CPU "owns" the pages at any given time.

That
would cut out a lot of the overhead and speed up packet processing.  One

title="Jesper Dangaard Brouer"></a>

little detail is that it would require space in the <tt>page</tt> structure
to indicate which device a page is dedicated to; space in that structure
tends to be in short supply.
<p>
On x86 systems, DMA is not usually the problem; instead, memory
allocation is.  He is working with a target of 14.8 million packets (full
wire speed on a 10Gb/s link) per
second; on a 3GHz system, that gives the kernel about 200 cycles in which
to process each packet.  Allocating a single page, though, takes 277 cycles
on that system, making the 14.8Mpps rate unattainable.  He pointed out <a
href="/Articles/683988/">Mel 
Gorman's recent work</a> to reduce memory-allocator overhead; that work reduced
the cost to 230 cycles â€” a significant improvement, but nowhere near
enough.
<p>
The <a href="http://dpdk.org/">DPDK</a> user-space networking code can
achieve the 14.8Mpps rate, 
he said, so it is clear that the kernel is doing something wrong and not
using the hardware optimally.  After two years of optimization work, he has
managed to double the kernel's processing rate to about 2Mpps, which, while
being a step in the right direction, is far from the target.
<p>
Drivers tend to work around the problem by allocating large pages and
splitting them into pieces.  An order-3 (eight-page) chunk can be allocated
in 503 cycles, which is more than the single-page cost, but, when split
into 4KB chunks, the per-page cost drops to 62 cycles.  That clearly helps
to reach the time budgets, but it has the disadvantage of pinning down
large chunks of memory if some piece of code hangs on to just one of the
component pages.  That, in turn, can push the system as a whole into an
out-of-memory situation, which can also adversely affect packet rates
(among other things).  For this reason, Google turns this mechanism off
internally.
<p>
Wouldn't it be better, he said, to just have a bulk page-allocation API
that would return multiple pages without the need to allocate them as a
single large page?  Mel Gorman answered that, in the end, it was just a
matter of coding to make that idea work.  The page allocator already has
the bulking concept internally, there just has been no reason to expose it
to the rest of the kernel before.  There should be no fundamental problem
with doing so, he said.

In general, there has not been a huge emphasis on page-allocation
performance optimization because most users immediately zero each page
after allocating it.  The cost of clearing the page's contents overwhelms
the cost of allocating the page in the first place.
<p>
What worries Mel, though, is the idea of implementing an entirely new
memory allocator.  Eventually that allocator would have to gain features
like NUMA awareness and would pick up "all the old mistakes," at which
point it would be as complex and slow as what we have now.  It would be
better, he said, to use the existing per-CPU allocator and optimize it for
this case; then all users in the kernel would benefit.  He has a patch now
that can halve the overhead of the page allocator if "certain assumptions
are made"; in particular, the user needs to not care about NUMA placement
and there should be a fair amount of memory available in general.
<p>
Jesper returned to the idea of a "page pool" that would be used to quickly
satisfy requests from network drivers (or other time-sensitive users).
This pool would be small, the number of pages required would be about equal
to the sum of the size of the receive ring and the transmit queue for each
device.  It is important to bound the size of the pool, or a persistent
traffic overload can run the system out of memory.  To that end, he said,
the page allocator should be able to shrink the page pool when memory is
tight.
<p>
He saw two ways of creating this pool.  One, that he called "all in," would
be to write an entirely new slab-like allocator.  The alternative is to
wrap some sort of layer around the existing page allocator.  Predictably,
Mel was not fond of the "all in" strategy; he said we already have too many
allocators and adding another will just create new problems.  It would be
better to add a bulk interface to the current allocator which, he repeated,
could be made to be much faster in some settings.
<p>
The direction for this work thus seems clear, but the challenges to
overcome are significant.  It may be a little while yet before a stock
kernel can hit that 14.8Mpps networking target.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

DPDK uses many optimizations, mostly to avoid cache misses. The Xeon processors have evolved to support features which minimize cache misses during I/O. The primary reason for using huge page allocations is to reduce the probability of TLB cache misses. NUMA alignment is important, as the device can write the packet directly into the processor cache (with the right processor), without ever touching memory. Using memory not attached to the same socket with the connection to the network device prevents using the processor cache, causing cache misses (which also happens if a CPU not in the correct socket is used).<br>

I think the title is a bit misleading, we will go further than just introducing a bulking facility for the page allocator.<br>

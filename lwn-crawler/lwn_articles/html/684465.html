Steven Whitehouse led a discussion about the interfaces between the block
subsystem and filesystems in a combined storage and filesystem session at
the 2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).
In some ways, the discussion was a catch-all for topics that were not
slated for their own session during the two-day summit.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, the block interface was not that complicated, Whitehouse
said.  But, over the last few years, there have been more and more device
types (both real and virtual), more filesystem choices, as well as features
like encryption, compression, copy on write, copy offload, and so on.  All
of these have an impact on the block and filesystem interfaces.
</p>

</a>

<p>
He believes that getting the interfaces right should be the primary
consideration that will ensure maximum interoperability.  It allows
modularization, which is more than simply a good engineering principle;
things that don't work can simply be replaced.
</p>

<p>
One of the changes that has come about is "dynamic devices", which are
devices that can change their attributes after they have been mounted.
<a href="/Articles/592645/">Thin provisioning</a> is a good example of
that, he said. 
For example, the device mapper
thin-provisioning (dm-thin) module needs a
way for filesystems to 
communicate their requirements for space that has been allocated, but
not written to, so that dm-thin can arrange to have
that storage present (which might require operator intervention).
Otherwise, operations that should always succeed (because of an earlier
<tt>fallocate()</tt>, say) might return <tt>ENOSPC</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara said that there had been talk of an interface to provide dm-thin
with the information it needs, but it might be better to use notifiers.  Al
Viro agreed and said that notifiers would also provide a more natural way to
inform the other layers that the device topology had changed in some way.
</p>

<p>
Mike Snitzer said that XFS is now working with dm-thin using a new
reservation interface to ask that some space be set aside for the
filesystem to use.  It is nice to have that software interface, but he
wondered if there was an equivalent way to reserve space on the hardware.
Martin Petersen said that there is an "anchor" facility that can guarantee
that certain logical block addresses (LBAs) are available for writes in the
future. 
</p>

<p>
That led to a quick discussion of what is really needed.  Snitzer said that
specific LBA numbers are not important, as he is just looking for a
reservation of a 
certain amount of space.  Kara said that the LBAs are not known when writes
go into the page cache, but the amount of space required is known.  But
reserving 
blocks on the device can lead to other problems.  Fred Knight asked, when
does the storage device know that it can release those blocks if the OS or
application crashes?  There was a thought that perhaps this could be
combined with streams (as was discussed in the <a
href="/Articles/684264/">standards update</a> earlier in the day) and a
timeout, which Knight said had been talked about in the standards bodies
along the way.
</p>

<p>
Whitehouse then moved to another topic: error reporting.  In particular,
what changes might be needed to support thin provisioning and other new
types of devices.  There is a need to inform other layers of changes in the
topology of the storage, but also  to report when certain kinds of
operations are not supported, such as shrinking a filesystem while it is
mounted. There was general agreement that work was needed in this area, but
no concrete plans emerged.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Articles/637035/">Shingled magnetic recording</a> (SMR) was up
next.  Whitehouse noted that it was the only new device type that didn't
have its own session at LSFMM.  Hannes Reinecke said that he didn't want to
bore the attendees with yet another SMR session.  He has posted <a
href="/Articles/682361/">patches</a> that add a <a href="/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a> to the
request queue to track the write pointer in the various zones of the
device.  There have been no comments, "so it must be OK", he said.
</p>

<p>
Reinecke mentioned that those patches also map the "reset write pointer"
command to the existing discard functionality, since they are closely
related.  Whitehouse wondered about that because discard is more of a hint
than a command.  Petersen noted that currently the <tt>ioctl()</tt>
commands are implemented directly as calls to the block library functions,
but that should change.  More specific building blocks should be used to
implement those <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o brought up a problem he had run into on mobile phones with inline
cryptographic processors.  Those processors keep the actual key information
internally; the kernel just gets a key ID that it uses to decrypt a block
device.  Device mapper does not currently support that, but he would like to
implement the functionality for the mainline kernel in a cleaner way than
was done for the phone.
</p>

<p>
Snitzer wondered why he had never heard of the problem, since he is a
device mapper maintainer.  Ts'o said that it was something that was done
quickly internally, but he hadn't gotten around to filing bugs and the
like.  He suggested that perhaps the data integrity (DIF/DIX) support in
the device mapper might be used instead, but was concerned that the device
mapper support might be lacking.
</p>

<p>
Darrick Wong said that device mapper does work with DIF/DIX, so it should
in theory be possible to use it.  He did not know how much "rigorous testing"
it had seen, however.  Snitzer said that he thought device mapper had "a
pretty good story" with respect to using DIF/DIX and stacking protection
profiles. 
</p>

<p>
Ts'o did mention another problem, though.  Getting a key ID from the inline
processor would involve an <a
href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone/">ARM
TrustZone</a> operation that could be slow, since it might require getting a
PIN from a user.  That part shouldn't go into device mapper, he said.
</p>

<p>
As time for the session expired, Whitehouse asked about the status of <a
href="/Articles/637436/">copy offload</a>.  Petersen said that the
support for token-based copies is ready.  It is awaiting some <a href="/Articles/683750/">block layer
cleanups</a> from Mike Christie, but is in "pretty good
shape" overall.  He said the <a
href="/Articles/659523/"><tt>copy_file_range()</tt></a> interface will be
available 
in the 4.6 
kernel.

There have been many disagreements over the years in the kernel community
concerning the exporting of internal kernel symbols to loadable modules.
Exporting a symbol often exposes implementation decisions to outside code,
makes it possible to use (or abuse) kernel functionality in unintended
ways, and makes future changes harder.  That said, there is no authority
overseeing the exporting of symbols and no process for approving exports;
discussions only tend to arise 
when somebody notices a change that they don't like.  But it is not
particularly hard to detect changes in symbol exports from one kernel
version to the next, and doing so can give some insights into the kinds of
changes that are happening under the hood.
<p>
The kernel has many thousands of functions and data structures; most of
those are private to a given source file, while others are made available
to the kernel as a whole.  Loadable modules are special, though; they only
have access to symbols that have been explicitly exported to them with
<tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> (or one of a few variants); many symbols that are
available to code built into the kernel image are unavailable to loadable
modules.  The intent of this 
limitation is to keep the interface to modules relatively narrow and
manageable.
<p>
It is far from clear that this objective has been achieved, though.
The 5.12 kernel exported 31,695 symbols to modules, which does not
create an impression of a narrow interface.  That number grew to
31,822 in 5.13-rc1.  That is an increase of 127 symbols, but the actual
story is a bit more complicated than that; 244 exported symbols were
removed over this time, while 371 were added.  The curious can see the full
sets of added and removed symbols on <a href="/Articles/856313/">this page</a>.
<p>
Some changes qualify more as a renaming than a removal or an addition.  For example,
<tt>pmbus_do_probe()</tt> is no longer exported in 5.13, at least in that
form; it is now listed (using a notation your editor made up on the spot)
as <tt>PMBUS::pmbus_do_probe()</tt>.  In other
words, this symbol has been moved out of the global namespace into a
subsystem-specific one.  <a
href="/Articles/760045/">Namespacing for exported kernel symbols</a> was added in
2018, but uptake has been relatively slow.  The 5.13 kernel adds one new
namespace (<tt>PMBUS</tt>) and that subsystem's exported symbols are moving
into it.  There are now 18
namespaces for symbols in the kernel:
<blockquote>
	<tt>CRYPTO_INTERNAL</tt>,
	<tt>FIRMWARE_LOADER_PRIVATE</tt>,
	<tt>LTC2497</tt>,
	<tt>MCB</tt>,
	<tt>NVME_TARGET_PASSTHRU</tt>,
	<tt>PMBUS</tt>,
	<tt>SND_INTEL_SOUNDWIRE_ACPI</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_HDA_COMMON</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_MERRIFIELD</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_AUDIO_CODEC</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_AUDIO_CODEC_I915</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_HIFI_EP_IPC</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_HIFI_EP_IPC</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_ACPI_DEV</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_PCI_DEV</tt>,
	<tt>SND_SOC_SOF_XTENSA</tt>,
	<tt>SOUNDWIRE_INTEL_INIT</tt>, and
	<tt>TEST_FIRMWARE</tt>.
</blockquote>
<p>
The sound subsystem has clearly been the most enthusiastic user of symbol
namespaces thus far.
<p>
Many other changes in exported symbols are the result of code refactoring
within the kernel.  Some <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5c88af59f9ab">optimizations</a> in the
bit-finding library caused functions like <tt>find_first_bit()</tt> to be
turned into inline functions in header files, which need not be exported.
But they fall back to functions like <tt>_find_first_bit()</tt>, which now
<i>do</i> need to be exported.  The generic-sounding <tt>vmem_map</tt>
symbol was specific to the ia64 architecture; it went away when ia64
dropped support for the <tt>VMEMMAP</tt> memory model.  Various
<tt>wimax_</tt> symbols disappeared along with the unloved WiMAX drivers
that exported them.
Functions like <tt>rt_mutex_destroy()</tt> were deleted because they were
unused.
<p>
Many of the new symbols correspond to new features; <tt>alloc_pages()</tt>
came with <a href="/Articles/855226/">batch page allocation</a>, for
example.  Others are a bit less clear; what, for example, is
<tt>dotdot_name</tt>?  The <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/80e5d1ff5d5f">commit</a> that added this
export explains it as "<q>useful constants: struct qstr for
'..'</q>", which may be seen by some as less than fully enlightening.
It provides a shortcut for filesystem code wanting to refer 
to directories named "<tt>..</tt>" without going to the trouble of wrapping it in
the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/include/linux/dcache.h#L40">"quick
string" structure</a> used to pass strings around in the virtual filesystem
layer.  Several filesystems make use of it in 5.13.
<p>
As a general rule, kernel symbols should not be exported unless there is a
user of them in the mainline kernel.  That rule is generally respected, but
there are exceptions.  As an example, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/drivers/firmware/xilinx/zynqmp.c#L842"><tt>zynqmp_pm_pinctrl_get_function()</tt></a>
was exported in 5.13-rc1, but has no in-kernel users.  The other
<tt>zynqmp_</tt> (all related to functionality on Xilinx Zynq
systems-on-chip) symbols that have been exported are not widely used and would 
be good candidates for hiding within their own namespace.  Another
exported-but-unused symbol is <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/kernel/cfi.c#L313"><tt>__cfi_slowpath_diag()</tt></a>,
which is part of the Clang <a href="/Articles/810077/">control-flow
integrity</a> implementation that was merged in this cycle.  The reason for
the exporting of this symbol is not entirely clear.  <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/kernel/cpu.c#L2524"><tt>__cpu_dying_mask()</tt></a>
was also <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e40f74c535b8">introduced and
exported</a> in 5.13 with no in-kernel users.  There are many others as
well; "export it just in case" seems to be a fairly common reflex for
kernel developers.
<p>
The 5.13 kernel saw the addition of eleven <tt>devm_</tt> exports, plus two
with the internal <tt>__devm_</tt> prefix.  Not all of these are used
either, but they do represent the type of symbol that one would expect to
be exported to modules.  These "managed device" functions are intended to
make device drivers easier to write and safer by taking care of the freeing
of allocated resources when a device is shut down.  There are over 300 of
these functions exported to modules now, and the list looks likely to continue
to grow.
<p>
The direct rendering manager (DRM) graphics subsystem added 17
<tt>drm_</tt> exports
this time around.  DRM is clearly one of the most complex driver APIs in
the kernel, with no less than 850 exported symbols in 5.13.  One begins to
understand why the developers of this subsystem have prioritized
documentation; this API would be unapproachable without it.  That, of
course, is a reflection of the problem space; graphics processors are
complex devices.
<p>
Given that it requires nearly 32,000 exported symbols for a "limited"
module interface, the kernel as a whole is also a complex environment.
That complexity is reflected in the increasing size of the interface it
offers to user space, but also in the growing interface it presents to
loadable modules.  This interface has increased significantly in size over
the years, often without a lot of review.  The good news is that, as an
internal kernel interface, the set of exported symbols can be changed at
any time.  So perhaps this list might shrink someday, but that will not
happen in the 5.13 cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sometimes one hits issues with macros that use inlined functions that have different EXPORT_SYMBOL behaviour on different architectures. For example, get_user() on powerpc was recently changed [1] to access mmu_feature_keys[] that is now an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbol.  So some out of tree non-GPL&#x27;d kernel modules now fail to build because of this on a specific architecture.  I don&#x27;t believe there are any sanity checks on the kernel to check for these inconsistencies.<br>

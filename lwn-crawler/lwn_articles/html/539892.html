<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 27, 2013</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, just over 8,000 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline for the 3.9 development cycle â€” 7,600 since <a
href="/Articles/539179/">last week's summary</a>.  Quite a few new features
of interest have been merged for the 3.9 kernel; the most significant of
those are listed below.
<p>
But first, <b>a warning</b> for development kernel testers: there are
reports of ext4 filesystem corruption with current mainline kernels.  The
problem appears to have been identified  and fixed,  but it will
remain as a permanent hazard for anybody running bisections over the
3.9 merge window.  Development kernels have not often lived up to their
fearsome reputation recently, but they can still bite at times.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The ARM architecture has gained support for the KVM virtualization
     mechanism on Cortex-A15 processors.  Support for the ARM "power state
     coordination interface" has been added so that virtual CPU's can be
     "powered up" and down.
<p>
<li> The socket filtering mechanism has a new <tt>SO_LOCK_FILTER</tt>
     option that prevents further changes to the filter.  It is intended
     for privileged programs that install a filter before running untrusted
     code. 
<p>
<li> TCP and UDP sockets have a new option, SO_REUSEPORT, that allows
     multiple sockets listening for new connections or packets
     (respectively) at the same time.  See <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/c617f398edd4db2b8567a28e899a88f8f574798d">this
     commit message</a> for more information.
<p>
<li> The netfilter connection-tracking code now supports "connection
     labels," which are bitmasks that can be attached to tracking entries and
     tested by netfilter rules.
<p>
<li> The wireless networking subsystem has gained core support for the
     detection of radar systems operating on the networking frequencies;
     this is a necessary component for <a href="/Articles/420623/">dynamic
     frequency selection</a> in the 5GHz range.
<p>
<li> VMware's "VM Sockets" subsystem, a mechanism for communication between 
     virtual machines and a hypervisor, has been merged.  Also merged is
     the "Virtual Machine Communication Interface" subsystem for high-speed
     communication between the host and guests.
<p>
<li> The networking layer has support for the "Multiple VLAN Registration
     Protocol" (MVRP), which facilitates communication about registered
     virtual networks to switches.
<p>
<li> The block layer's handling of pages under writeback <a
     href="/Articles/528031/">has been changed</a> to address the
     performance penalty imposed by the previous "stable pages" work.
<p>
<li> The PowerPC architecture supports a new set of transactional memory
     instructions; at this time, only user-space support is provided (the
     kernel does not use these instructions).  See <a
     href="/Articles/539913/">Documentation/powerpc/transactional_memory.txt</a>
     for more information.
<p>
<li> The Xen virtualization subsystem gained support for ACPI-based CPU and
     memory hotplugging, though, in both cases, only the "add" operation is
     supported currently.
<p>
<li> The ext4 filesystem now supports hole punching in block-mapped files.
<p>
<li> A long list of old network drivers has been deleted; these include the
     venerable 3c501, 3c505, and 3c507 drivers, various Intel i825xx
     drivers, parallel port-based drivers(!), and many more.  It is
     expected that these drivers will not be 
     missed, as many of them did not work all that well in the first
     place.  As Paul Gortmaker <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/de8270ff4642f78ff62e9bae20e6ebf39677880c">put
     it</a>: "<q>You know things are not good when the Kconfig help text suggests
     you make a cron job doing a ping every minute.</q>"  The
     long-unused "WAN router" subsystem has also been removed.
<p>

     <p>
     <li> <b>USB</b>:

	  tree and into the mainline kernel.
     </ul>

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The netpoll mechanism now supports IPv6, allowing network consoles to
     be run over IPv6 networks.
<p>
<li> Most drivers no longer depend on the <tt>EXPERIMENTAL</tt>
     configuration option.  So much code needed that option that it is
     turned on almost universally, with the result that it does not
     actually mean anything.  So now it defaults to "yes," and it will soon
     be removed entirely.
<p>
<li> The sound layer has a generic parser for Intel high definition audio
     (HDA) codecs.  Many drivers have been converted to use this parser,
     resulting in the removal of a great deal of duplicated code.
<p>
<li> The <tt>__get_user_8()</tt> function is now available on 32-bit x86
     systems; it will fetch a 64-bit quantity from user space.
<p>
<li> The module signing code has a few usability enhancements.  The
     <tt>sign-file</tt> utility has new options to specify which hash
     algorithm to use or to simply provide the entire signature (which will
     have been computed elsewhere).  There is also a new
     <tt>MODULE_SIG_ALL</tt> configuration option that controls whether
     modules are automatically signed at <tt>modules_install</tt> time.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/533632/">descriptor-based GPIO patch set</a>
     has been merged, with significant changes to how GPIO lines are
     handled within the kernel.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>file_inode()</tt> helper should be used instead of the
     traditional <tt>file-&gt;f_dentry-&gt;d_inode</tt> pointer chain.
</ul>
<p>
The merge window should stay open through approximately March 5, though,
one assumes, the rate of change will drop off somewhat toward the end.
Next week's edition will summarize the changes that go in for the final
part of the 3.9 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The ext4 bug only affects file systems &gt; 512GB.   If you are using smaller file systems on your test/development box, or you make sure you unmount your larger file systems while you are doing your bisection search, you should be fine.<br>
<p>
That being said, I'm very embarrassed this bug slipped through our code review and testing processes.  We have been discussing how to improve the testing that we do on ext4 file systems to avoid this sort of problem from slipping through our development cycle in the future.<br>

Maybe kernel.org could start providing a machine-readable list of known-dangerous commits, the commits that fix them, and a description.  A git bisect wrapper could read this list and warn the user (or skip over it) when it lands on something known to be bad.<br>

      In addition to a number of DEC copyrights and a bunch of Don Becker's drivers, a number of fabulous comments have disappeared from the kernel this day. A selection:

<blockquote>
*!@$ protocol=eth_type_trans -- now packets flow
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The EtherWORKS 3  driver in this distribution is  designed to  work with all
kernels   &gt;  1.1.33   (approx)  and  includes  tools   in  the  'ewrk3tools'
subdirectory   to  allow  set   up of   the   card,  similar  to  the  MSDOS
'NICSETUP.EXE' tools provided on  the DOS drivers  disk (type 'make' in that
subdirectory to make the tools).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
2) if you wish, edit the  source code near  line 1530 to reflect the I/O
address and IRQ you're using
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Fix the last fix...sorry, must be galloping senility
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>
case DEPCA_SAY_BOO:     /* Say "Boo!" to the kernel log file */
        if(!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
                return -EPERM;
        printk("%s: Boo!\n", dev->name);
        break;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    /* This should be probed for (or set via an ioctl()) at run-time.
       Right now we use a sleazy hack to pass in the interface number
       at boot-time via the low bits of the mem_end field.  That value is
       unused, and the low bits would be discarded even if it was used. */
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[This is currently quite safe.... but if one day the 3c503 explodes
 you know where to come looking ;)]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The E2100 series ethercard is a fairly generic shared memory 8390
implementation.  The only unusual aspect is the way the shared memory
registers are set: first you do an inb() in what is normally the
station address region, and the low three bits of next outb() *address*
is used as the write value for that register.  Either someone wasn't
too used to dem bit en bites, or they were trying to obfuscate the
programming interface.
<p>
[...]
<p>
One bug on the chip is that even a hard reset won't disable the memory
window, usually resulting in a hung machine if mem_off() isn't called.
If this happens, you must power down the machine for about 30 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The MB86965 has a design flaw that makes all probes unreliable.  Not
only is it difficult to detect, it also moves around in I/O space in
response to inb()s from other device probes!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
results from ftp performance tests with Linux 1.2.5
<p>
  send and receive about 350-400 KByte/s (peak up to 460 kbytes/s)
<p>
  sending in NOP-mode: peak performance up to 530K/s (but better don't
  run this mode)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The card has 256k of on-board RAM, which is used to buffer received packets. It
might seem at first that more buffers are better, but in fact this isn't true.
From my tests, it seems that more than about 10 buffers are unnecessary, and
there is a noticeable performance hit in having more active on the card.  So
the majority of the card's memory isn't, in fact, used.
</blockquote>

And, of course, the immortal 3c501:

<blockquote>
Do not purchase this card, even as a joke.  It's performance is horrible,
and it breaks in many ways.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Some documentation is available from 3Com. Due to the boards age
standard responses when you ask for this will range from 'be serious'
to 'give it to a museum'. The documentation is incomplete and mostly
of historical interest anyway.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The driver is less efficient than it could be. It switches through
receive mode even if more transmits are queued. If this worries you buy
a real Ethernet card.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Attempt to send a packet to a 3c501 card. There are some interesting
catches here because the 3c501 is an extremely old and therefore
stupid piece of technology.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
We have a good packet. Well, not really "good", just mostly not broken.
</blockquote>

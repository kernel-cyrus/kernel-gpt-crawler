<p>
At <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america">LinuxCon
North America</a> in Toronto, Chris Mason relayed some of the experiences
that his employer, Facebook, has had using Btrfs, especially with regard to
its performance on high-speed solid-state storage devices (SSDs).  While
Mason was the primary developer 
early on in the history of Btrfs, he is one of a few maintainers of the
filesystem now, and the project has seen contributions from around 70
developers throughout the Linux community in the last year.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/698107/">

</a>

<p>
He is on the kernel team at Facebook; one of the main reasons the company
wanted to hire him was because it wanted to use Btrfs in production.  Being
able to use Btrfs in that kind of environment
is also the primary reason he chose to take the job, he said.  As the
company is rolling Btrfs out, it is figuring out which features it wants to
use and finding things that work well and not so well.
</p>

<p>
Mason went through the usual list of high-level Btrfs features, including
efficient writable snapshots, internal RAID with restriping, online device
management, online
scrubbing to check in the background if the CRCs are the same as when the
data was written, and so on.  The CRCs for both data and metadata are a
feature that "saved us a lot of pain" at Facebook, he said.
</p>

<p>
The Btrfs CRC checking means that a read from a corrupted sector will cause
an I/O error rather than return garbage.  Facebook had some storage
devices that would appear to store data correctly in a set of logical block addresses
(LBAs) until the next reboot, at which
point reads to those blocks would return GUID partition table (GPT) data instead.  He did not
name the device maker because it turned out to actually be a BIOS problem.
In any case, the CRCs allowed the Facebook team to quickly figure out that
the problem was not in Btrfs when it affected thousands of machines as they
were rebooted for a kernel upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Volume management in Btrfs is done in terms of "chunks", which are normally
1GB in size.  That is part of what allows the filesystem to handle
differently sized devices for RAID volumes, for example.  Volumes can have
specific chunks reserved for data or metadata and different RAID levels can
be applied to each (e.g. RAID-1 for the metadata and RAID-5 for the data).
</p>

<p>
But Btrfs has had some lock-contention problems; it still has some of
them, he said, though there are improvements coming.  The filesystem is
optimized for use on SSDs, but he ran an <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fsmark/">fs_mark</a> benchmark in a
virtual machine (for comparative rather than hard numbers)
creating zero-length files and found that XFS could create roughly four
times the number of files per second (33,000 versus 9,000).  That was "not good", but
before he started tuning Btrfs, he wanted to make XFS go as fast as he could.
</p>

<p>
To that end, he looked at what XFS was blocked on, which turned out to be
locks for allocating filesystem objects.  By increasing the allocation
groups in the filesystem when it was created (from four to sixteen to match
the number of CPUs in his test system), he could increase its performance
to 200,000 file-creations per second.  At that point, it was mostly CPU
bound and the function using the most CPU was one that could not be easily
tweaked away with a <tt>mkfs</tt> option.
</p>

<p>
So then he turned to Btrfs.  Using perf, he was able to see that there was
lock contention on the B-tree locks.  The Btrfs B-tree stores all of its
data in the leaves of the tree; when it is updating the tree, it has to
lock non-leaf nodes on the way to the leaf, starting with the root node.
For some operations, those locks have to be held as it
traverses the tree.  Hopefully only the leaf needs to be locked, but
sometimes that is not the case and, since everything starts at the root, it
is not surprising that there is contention for that lock.
</p>

<p>
As an experiment to make Btrfs go faster, he used the subvolume feature to
effectively create more root nodes.  Instead of the usual one volume (with
one root node), he created sixteen subvolumes so that there was one per
CPU, each with its own root node and lock.  That allowed Btrfs to get close
to the XFS performance at 175,000 
file-creations per second.
</p>

<p>
But the goal was to make the filesystem faster without resorting to
subvolumes, which led to a new B-tree locking scheme.  By default, Btrfs
has 16KB nodes, which is not changing, but instead of being treated as a
single group, each node will now be broken up into sixteen groups, each
with its own lock.
</p>

<p>
He has not yet picked the best number of groups for each node, but the
change allows a
default Btrfs filesystem create 90,000 files per second.  There are a lot
of assumptions in Btrfs that there is only one lock per node, which he is
working on removing.  In addition, Btrfs switched to reader/writer locks a
ways back and it turns out that those perform worse than expected, so he
will be looking into that.
</p>

<p>
By some other measures, though, Btrfs compares favorably with XFS on the
benchmark.  XFS writes 120MB/second and does 3000 I/O
operations/second (IOPS) for the benchmark, while Btrfs does 50MB/second
and 300 IOPS to accomplish the same amount of work.  That means that Btrfs
is ordering things better and doing 
less I/O, Mason said.
</p>

<p>
The Gluster workloads at Facebook, which use rotational storage,  are
extremely sensitive to metadata 
latency to the point where one node's high latency can make the entire
cluster slower than it should be.   In the past, the company has used <a
href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/flashcache">flashcache</a> (which
is similar to <a href="https://bcache.evilpiepirate.org/">bcache</a>) for
both XFS and Btrfs to cache some data and metadata on SSDs, which improves
the metadata latencies, but not enough. 
</p>

<p>
To combat that, he has a set of patches to automatically put the Btrfs
metadata on SSDs.  The block layer provides information on whether the
storage is rotational; for now, his patch assumes that if it is not
rotational then it is fast.  The patch has made a huge difference in the
latencies and requires less flash storage (e.g. 450GB for 40TB filesystem)
for Facebook's file workload that consists of a wide variety of file
sizes. "You will need a lot more metadata if you 
have all 2KB files", he said.
</p>

<p>
That patch set is small (73 lines of code added), which is nice, he said.
It is not entirely complete, though, as btrfs-utils needs changes to
support it, but that should be a similarly sized change.
</p>

<p>
Another bottleneck he has encountered is in using the trim (or discard)
command to tell SSDs about blocks that are no longer in use by the
filesystem.  That allows the flash translation layer to ignore those blocks
when it is doing garbage collection and should, in theory, provide better
performance.  But many devices are slow when handling trim commands.  Both
XFS and Btrfs keep lists of blocks to trim, submit them as trim commands,
and then must wait for those commands to 
complete during transaction commits, which stalls new filesystem
operations.  Those stalls can be huge, on the order of "tens of seconds", he said.
</p>

<p>
Ric Wheeler spoke up to say that trim is simply a request that the drive is
free to ignore.  He suggested that trim should not be performed during regular
filesystem operations.  Ted Ts'o agreed and said that the best practice for
ext4 and probably other filesystems was to run the <tt>fstrim</tt>
batch-trimming command regularly out of <tt>cron</tt>.
</p>

<p>
In answer to a question, Mason said that the disadvantages of not trimming
are device-dependent.   In some cases, it may reduce the lifetime of the
device or add latencies during garbage collection, but it may also do
nothing.  Wheeler pointed out that if you are using thin provisioning,
though, failing to trim could cause the storage to run out of space when
there is actually space available.
</p>

<p>
Though it is not a flash-specific change, there have been some problems
with large (&gt; 16TB) Btrfs filesystems because of the free-space cache.
Originally, free extents were not tracked, but that required scanning the
entire filesystem at mount time, which was slow.  When free-space
was added, the cache was per-block-group and large filesystems have a lot
of block groups,
which meant that there was more caching on each commit.  In the 4.5 
kernel, Omar
Sandoval added a new free-space cache (which can be enabled with
<tt>-o&nbsp;space_cache=v2</tt>) that is "dramatically faster", with commit
latencies dropping from four to zero seconds.
</p>

<p>
For the near future, he plans to finalize the new B-tree locking and improve
some <tt>fsync()</tt> bottlenecks, though he thinks that the new space cache
will help there.  There are also some other spinlocks slowing
things down that he wants to look at.
</p>

<p>
He mentioned a few of the tools that he uses to find bottlenecks.  Perf is
the right tool when processing is "pegged in the CPU", but finding problems
when things are blocking is much harder.  For that, he recommended <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html">BPF</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a>.  In particular, Brendan
Gregg's <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/offcputime.py">offcputime</a>
BPF script is useful to show both kernel and application stack traces to
help show the reasons why a process is blocked.
  In fact, Facebook likes offcputime
so much that fellow Btrfs maintainer Josef Bacik has created a way to
aggregate the output of the program across multiple systems.
</p>

<p>
There were a few questions at the end of the session.  One person asked
whether Mason had seen any uptake of Btrfs for smaller devices.  Mason said
that the filesystem "needs love and care" when it is being used, which is
why Facebook can use it.  Someone with an ARM background would need to be
working on Btrfs upstream in order to provide that kind of care if it were to be
adopted on ARM-powered devices, he said.
</p>

<p>
Another asked how much faster the current design of Btrfs could go.  Mason
seemed quite optimistic that it could go "much faster".  The metadata
format is flexible, so "if things are broken, we can fix them".
</p>

<p>
The last two questions regarded two different benchmarks, both of which are
interesting, but neither of which Mason has run.  Flashcache versus bcache
would likely provide similar numbers, he thought, but flashcache worked for Facebook so
there was no need to try bcache.  He also has not run benchmarks against ZFS.
When he started Btrfs, ZFS was not available.  There is no reason not to do
so now, he said, but he hasn't, though he would be interested in
the results.

      <p>Is it just me, or does the creation of e.g. 175,000 or 200,000 files <em>per second</em> on a single computer (albeit one with multiple cores) on (presumably) a single filesystem seem just the slightest bit outrageous?</p>

<p>Granted, this <em>is</em> Facebook, and their data storage requirements are colossal (to say the least), but I just imagine a company, even of FB size, to distribute massive file creation of that order to at least, say, 10 or 20 computers.</p>

On a desktop computer it's overkill. For high performance workloads on storage that can do millions of IOPS, it is considered "barely sufficient".<br>

      <p>To put that sort of number into context, it's on the order of 1 file per second for each person in <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">0.02% of Facebook's daily active user base</a>. Spread that userbase across 5,000 machines, and it's still only one file per second per user per machine - and that's assuming it's the sort of data that doesn't benefit from locality of access, so can be spread sensibly.
<p>Gives you a sense of how badly intuition can break down at unusual scales...

We just use these benchmarks as a way to classify our metadata performance overhead.  So while we don't personally _need_ 200k files/sec, the workload quickly shows us where we have pain points that would cause us problems with real world workloads.  So seeing the tree lock show up in this test is a good indication that we could hit latencies with our normal day to day workloads, so it's something we work on.<br>

<p>That is about <em>absolute speed</em> of metadata operations, and that's not the real issue. The real issue being described here is that metadata operations don't scale with hardware capacity, regardless of the absolute speed desires, that is the real issue is about design.</p>

<p>The real issue exists because it is relatively easy to have scalable <strong>data</strong> speeds: just choose a domain which is "easily parallelizable" and throw more disks more RAM more threads at it. For data, RAID scales up speed pretty nicely.</p>

<p>By contrast metadata operations are not easily parallelizable, because there are dependencies across metadata, both structural dependencies and ordering dependencies, and therefore fairly fine grained locking must be used (ordering) and RAID does not work as well (structural).</p>

<p>The biggest problem with hard-to-parallelize metadata is not even file creation rates, it is whole-tree scans, like <tt>fsck</tt> or RSYNC scans. I have seen a lot of cases where some "clever" person designed a storage subsystem for <em>average</em> <em>data</em> workloads, and that became catastrophes during <em>peak</em> <em>metadata</em> workloads,  which must happen quite periodically, one way or another.</p>

I'm pretty sure the GP, one of the lead developers of BTRFS and mentioned in this article, is fully aware of this. No need to reiterate :)<br>

Say for example you want to check-out a source repository that has millions of small files, file creation can be a serious bottleneck. <br>

I'm intrigued.  Do you mean that checking out on a btrfs is slowed down as opposed to say ext4 or xfs?  <br>
<p>
I've just checked out Libre Office a few times and copied it around a bit.  As a long time Gentoo user on a fair few systems, I'm quite familiar with how some pretty large software projects behave from source to binary.  <br>
<p>
LO is "only" about 82,000 files at 2.2GB. On my laptop with a reasonably modern Core i7 quad core + HT, with 16GB RAM and 1 x SSD + 1 x spinning disc, it takes a fair old while to compile and needs rather a lot of space.  On previous laptops it used to be an overnight thing.  Check out times are the least of my worries.<br>
<p>
Back to your assertion, even if you are checking out over a 10GBs-1 connection I doubt that the fs is holding you back.   What kind of projects involve millions of files?  Also what sort of repo are you using?<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>
Jon<br>

Disclaimer: I work at Facebook but not in that team, so I don't know the specifics. However Google has released some numbers about their monorepo (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-st...</a>), and it's about 9M files.<br>
It was just to say, it's not "outrageous" to have a directory with million of files, which could be checked out all at once. The FS performance definitely plays a major role there.<br>

Again though, this isn't _about_ file creation, it's about metadata ops; file creation is a convenient way to exercise it, while also being relevant to some usages.<br>
<p>
Grepping a tree for the first time today?  Atime updates.  "make clean" in a large repository?  combinations of mtime and deletions.  "apt-get upgrade" with a bunch of pending updates?  Oh, you better believe there's a shittonne (SI technical unit) of file creations, fsyncs, mv's and other metadata updates.  <br>
<p>
It ends up being a major but sometimes hidden determinant of how fast you can get shit done.<br>

Many applications may need to multiplex or demultiplex files out of container formats. In the case of scientific imaging, we have cases today where we want to transcode a proprietary image, unpack its constituent image tiles, and manipulate the files with open source tools which do not understand the proprietary container format.<br>
<p>
A single microscope slide image might have 100k to 200k tiles in it, totalling a few hundred GB of space. We often want to unpack and host each tile as an individual JPEG file on a static http file server, where a client-side pan/zoom viewer can retrieve just the tiles it need as a user navigates the viewport.  If we are transcoding the tiles, we may be CPU limited but if we are simply extracting them without changing the codec format, we are limited by the metadata rates on the filesystem.<br>
<p>
Conversely, time-series imagery might be produced as a sequence of image frames from data acquisition tools and later multiplexed and/or re-compressed into a movie container format. An hour at 60 fps is 216k frames. However, scientists may want to apply other batch processing steps to each image frame before converting it to a movie file for archving or distribution.  These jobs could run much faster than real-time, and the metadata rates can become the bottleneck.  Such processing is often too exploratory or ad hoc to justify a custom, tuned implementation where you would get your hands on libraries of all needed algorithms, plan your buffer pipeline, and avoid bounding data through external commands with file I/O.<br>

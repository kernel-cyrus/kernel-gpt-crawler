<h1>The search for fast, scalable counters</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel needs to count a lot of things.  There are counters for
networking statistics, usage of various resources, and so on.  One would
ordinarily think that operating a counter would be a relatively
straightforward task, but ordinarily simple things can become complicated
in the kernel context, especially when the number of processors involved
gets large.
<p>

In theory, a counter is just a simple integer variable.  In an SMP
environment, however, that variable must be protected against concurrent
updates, or it will eventually get corrupted.  The tool that kernel hackers
reach for first in this situation is the <tt>atomic_t</tt> type.  Atomic
variables are simple integers with a set of atomic operations.  If you have
an <tt>atomic_t</tt> variable called <tt>counter</tt>, that counter can be
incremented with a call like:
<p>
<pre>
    atomic_inc(&amp;counter);
</pre>
<p>
and its value will be changed in an SMP-safe, interrupt-safe manner.  These
operations are 
relatively fast, being hand-coded to use the mechanisms provided by each
host architecture.  In many cases, an <tt>atomic_t</tt> counter is the best
solution to the problem.
<p>

The problem with <tt>atomic_t</tt> counters is that they use expensive
locked operations, and they require that the current CPU obtain exclusive
cache access for the variable.  A frequently-modified atomic counter can
cause a cache line to bounce constantly between CPUs, impacting the
performance of the entire system.  As an example, consider <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/169763/">this patch set</a> from Ravikiran
Thirumalai.  He replaced a single counter (the <tt>memory_allocated</tt>
field of the <tt>proto</tt> structure) in the networking code with a more
SMP-friendly counter, and reported a 5% improvement in an Apache benchmark
on an eight-processor system.  5% is a nice improvement for changing a
single counter, but it seems that perhaps even better results could be had.
<p>

Ravikiran replaced the <tt>atomic_t</tt> counter with the
<tt>percpu_counter</tt> type.  These counters use per-CPU variables to hold
a CPU-local count.  Modifying that count is fast, since it is local to the
given CPU,  no locking is required, and no cache lines need be moved from
other processors.  If any given processor's count exceeds a given
threshold, its value is added to a (spinlock-protected) global count, and
the CPU-local count is set back to zero.  Queries of the counter look only
at the global count.  The result is a counter which is somewhat
approximate, but quite fast.  In many cases, an "almost right" count is
entirely good enough.
<p>

Per-CPU counters become increasingly inaccurate as the number of processors
grows, however.  Each processor has a certain residual count which has not
yet been folded into the global count.  In situations where counters tend
to increase, the result will be a global count which underestimates the
real value, and which is increasingly wrong on larger systems.  Per-CPU
counters are also memory-intensive, partly due to inefficiencies in how
per-CPU variables are allocated.
<p>

So the discussion wandered toward <a href="/Articles/170050/">another
possibility</a> implemented with the somewhat obscure <tt>local_t</tt>
type.  This type is apparently intended to function as a sort of
<tt>atomic_t</tt> which is only visible to a single CPU; it is currently
only used in two places in the kernel: to manage module reference counts
and in the x86-64 architecture code.  It supports a set of
operations similar to <tt>atomic_t</tt>: <tt>local_set()</tt>,
<tt>local_read</tt>, <tt>local_add()</tt>, etc.  There is also a set of
variants (cpu_local_set(), ...) intended for use with a <tt>local_t</tt>
declared as a per-CPU variable.  The default implementation uses
<tt>atomic_t</tt> for 32-bit systems and a strange three-variable
structure for 64-bit systems.  All architectures are encouraged to
reimplement the type in a more efficient, interrupt-safe manner, however,
and that has been done for several of them.
<p>

The <tt>local_t</tt> solution would set up two counters for each CPU, a
flag saying which of the two is in use, and a global count.  For many operations,
they would behave just like <tt>percpu_counter</tt>, and they could yield
the same approximate answer.  Should a precise count be needed, however,
the "which counter" bit would be flipped and all of the per-CPU offsets
summed.  The result would be an exact count at the time the bit was
flipped, at the cost of taking a spinlock and iterating through the array. 
<p>

All of this starts to look a little elaborate, however, and that may be the
point where kernel developers lose interest.  A counter should only be so
complex, and making the code more twisted can only improve things to a
point.  Sooner or later, people will decide that there are more important
things to be working on.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I wrote some network quota code a few years ago (ipt_quota) which worked nicely but thinking about concurrency issues made my head hurt so I haven't done a great deal on it since. I'd have liked to have had (or at least known about) this back then. Having nice, reliable, fast counters helps everyone so time spent getting this right now isn't necessarily time wasted.<br>

      Speaking as a complete outsider...
<blockquote><cite>

In situations where counters tend to increase, the result will be a global count which underestimates the real value, and which is increasingly wrong on larger systems.
</cite></blockquote>
To avoid underestimation, a better approximation can be obtained by considering the mean values for every counter. If N is the number of processors and M is the max value for every counter, adding N * M / 2 to the current measure would yield the expected value. Max error bound would be N * M / 2, while standard deviation (i.e. expected error) should be around sqrt(N) * M / 2. (In fact, if I'm not mistaken the distribution followed would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution" >Student's t-distribution</a>, but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_Distribution" >normal</a> is a good approximation.)
<p>
This means that the expected error should only grow with the square root of the number of processors: with 64 processors, the error is only 8 times bigger than on a single processor system. Choosing a small enough max value M would make the measure even more precise.
<p>
And while we are at it, I understand that a semaphore is needed to increment each per-CPU value, but to read it? Why not read on the fly all per-CPU counters and add them to the global counter when a count is required?

Exactly what I was thinking!  After all a counter is _inherently_ inaccurate: by the time the kernel reports the value back to whomever was asking there's an excellent chance it's changed.  So why would it matter if we don't lock the counter before we read it?  It seems like there are a number of options that could be considered, although certainly there are complexities as well.<br>

      In general, you can run into problems where the counter is being incremented as it is being read.  Say you're using a (mythical) 8-bit architecture, and the 16-bit counter value is being incremented from 0x00ff to 0x0100.  The intermediate state, as the counter is being updated, will be 0x0000 (or perhaps 0x01ff) because only 8 bits are being written at a time.  Much worse than the off-by-one situation that I think you were imagining.  And worse still if it is a 64 bit counter on a 32 bit system...<br>
<p>
Caveat- I don't know anything the specific types mentioned in the article (local_t in particular) so this particular problem might not be an issue there depending on how the atomicity of it works.<br>

      So, just stick to the size native to the architecture. On 32-bit machines, never use more than 32 bits for the intermediate values; if you happen to be on a Z80 (not so mythical 8-bit architecture) use a max value of 255 for them.
<p>
Incrementing a 32-bit register on a 32-bit architecture <i>is</i> an atomic operation even on multi-processor systems, right?

      Who said anything about semaphores with per-CPU counters?  The article specifically said there is no locking required for updating a per-CPU counter.  It says you never read a per-CPU counter.
<p>
Also, there is no locking required to <em>read</em> the global counter.
<p>
Now as for the orthogonal issue of getting a complete count instead of just reading the global counter: how are you going to read the per-CPU counter of another CPU?  The only way is for that CPU to write it out to main memory and for you to go to main memory to get it.  That takes a long time, and that's the slowness that per-CPU counters are supposed to eliminate.

<p>
This is a relatively recent addition to the things performance programmers have to worry about.  Used to be, electronic memory was considered fast, and it was always the same speed.  Typically, it took at most 4 cycles to access it.  Now, there are 4 levels of electronic memory (including the registers) and the main pool is 200 cycles away.  We think of looking at memory now the way we used to think of loading a file from a disk.
<p>
I'm not ashamed to say my personal leaning these days is toward single-CPU single-core machines tied together at the network adapter.  My brain can handle only so much complexity.
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
That locking operation is for updating a counter.  For accessing one, the only cost is moving the cache line from one CPU to another -- through main memory.  Whoops, I just remembered - on fancy modern machines, there's a shortcut to move a cache line without going out on the memory bus.  So it's cheaper than what I said earlier, but still more than folks are willing to pay.

5 levels sometimes (at least in principle).  There exist Intel chips with L3 caches (Xeon Gallatin, I think), and presumably each cache type is a different speed from the others and from main memory.

      A sweeper thread is probably needed that, once/second, consolidates the local (per cpu) counters onto the one global one that is seen in /proc.<br>
That way slow moving counters don't become too inaccurate.<br>

<h1>A Linux kernel compatibility layer for FreeBSD?</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 5, 2011</br>
           </div>
<p>
As part of his work in porting a Linux-based InfiniBand stack to FreeBSD, Jeff
Roberson put together a compatibility layer that maps Linux-specific kernel
functionality to FreeBSD equivalents.  He <a
href="/Articles/421605/">announced</a> this effort on the freebsd-arch
mailing list in order to get a general sense of what other FreeBSD
developers thought of the idea&mdash;and whether it might make sense to
combine it with other, similar, compatibility shims.  The thread gives an
interesting look into the problems that less popular operating systems have
when trying to support new functionality that is already well-established
in Linux, even if all of that code is <a href="/Articles/412748/">not in the mainline</a>.
</p>

<p>
The InfiniBand stack that Roberson ported was developed by the <a
href="http://www.openfabrics.org/">OpenFabrics Alliance</a> as part of its
OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED). It largely consists of patches
on top of the existing Linux InfiniBand code.  All of the code is available
under both
the GPL and BSD licenses, which is what allowed Roberson to port it to
FreeBSD.  In order to minimize changes to that stack, though, he
created a fairly large compatibility layer:
<div class="BigQuote">
The infiniband port has been done by creating a 10,000 line KPI [Kernel
Programming Interface]
compatability layer.  With this layer the vast majority of the driver code
runs unmodified.  The exceptions are anything that interfaces with skbs and
most of the code that deals with network interfaces.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Roberson goes on to list the kinds of things that the compatibility layer
supports, including atomic operations, various device types, interrupts,
kobjects, radix and rbtrees, lists, spinlocks, and so on.  For the most
part, it is just translating Linux-isms into their FreeBSD counterparts.
The current state of the wrapper can be seen in Roberson's <a
href="http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base/projects/ofed/head/sys/ofed/include/linux/">svn
repository</a>, which consists of a linux kernel include tree along with
code to implement those Linux-isms.  The OFED code can then be built by
pointing it at the include tree.

</blockquote>
<p>
Only those parts of Linux that were needed by the OFED code were actually
implemented in the compatibility layer, but Roberson wonders if it makes
sense to combine his effort with others:
<div class="BigQuote">
I have seen that some attempt at similar wrappers has been made
elsewhere. I wonder if instead of making each one tailored to individual
components, which mostly seem to be filesystems so far, should we put this
in a central place under compat somewhere?
</div>
</p>

<p>
While there was some predictable Linux-bashing in the thread, most
participants seemed favorably inclined toward the compatibility layer
itself, as well as making it more widely available to other parts of the
FreeBSD kernel tree.  There are some difficulties, of course, including
exactly <i>which</i> Linux kernel version should be tracked.  As was
<a href="/Articles/421612/">pointed out</a>, somewhat caustically, by
Garrett Wollman in the
thread, internal Linux interfaces change with some 
frequency, and without much warning:
<div class="BigQuote">
Fundamentally, maintaining any sort of Linux compatibility is a losing
battle, since the hordes will keep on rototilling interfaces in every
release until the cows come home, with no concern (and in many cases
utter contempt) for anyone else who might need to maintain kernel
code.  It's a testament to their size and ability that they have
managed to keep the system relatively usable and stable over the long
term when major parts of the system get replaced on such a regular
basis.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It's not just the size and ability of the Linux community that has led to a
stable and usable system, though.  As Matthew Jacob <a
href="/Articles/421672/">notes</a>, Linux developers point to the ability
to change the internal interfaces as one of the strengths of their
development model.  Although the FreeBSD developers may not agree with it, the <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt">stable_api_nonsense</a>
document does provide reasons for the Linux developers' disdain for stable
internal APIs.

<p>
Still, choosing a kernel version to track is not necessarily easy.
Based on some previous work maintaining an out-of-tree Linux filesystem, Chris
BeHanna was able to <a href="/Articles/421618/">offer some advice</a> on
that:
<div class="BigQuote">
	I would say that you want to pick a major release of one or at most two major commercial distros (I'll pick on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the enterprise SuSE for illustration), and track the major releases of them that correspond to roughly the same Linux kernel version, and then STICK to that for the life of a given FreeBSD release stream.  Commercial vendors backport fixes into their otherwise-fairly-stable major releases, which minimizes your pain. There are still some changes here and there along the way, and you have to decide how many kernel config options you are willing to support (I'd suggest the default SMP, maybe the default PAE, and punt everything else or you'll go mad).
<p>
	The combinatorial pain of committing to more than that leads to a
	desire for seppuku:  I had to support multiple kernel versions each
	(and often multiple configurations per kernel) for Red Hat 7, 8, 9;
	RHEL 4 and 5, SuSE Enterprise 9, 10, 10.1, and 10.2, SuSE Desktop 9
	and 10, and Fedora 4, 5, and 6 across x86, x86-64, and IA-64, and
	it ended up being more than 400 binaries to be generated, tested,
	and delivered every time we issued a patch release.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are some obvious advantages to using the OFED code with minimal
modifications.  Bug fixes and enhancements are being made regularly that
could be incorporated into the FreeBSD kernel fairly easily using the
compatibility layer.  But some argue that adding such a layer will result
in fewer vendors trying to get their code working natively for FreeBSD,
likening it to the <a
href="http://www.leidinger.net/blog/2010/09/28/the-freebsd-linuxulator-explained-for-users/">linuxulator</a>
that allows Linux binaries to run on FreeBSD.  Alexander Kabaev <a
href="/Articles/421629/">put it</a> this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] [A] Linux compat layer in kernel will have the
same effect as linuxulator in userland - we do have some vendors still
trying to bother with FreeBSD drivers for their hardware now and we
will have none after we provide the possibility to hack their Linux
code to run somewhat stably on top of Linux compat layer.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Roberson is <a href="/Articles/421630/">not convinced</a> that the
linuxulator has had a negative effect on FreeBSD market share, and instead
sees it as
allowing FreeBSD to "<q>stay relevant in areas where companies can not justify an independent
FreeBSD effort.  Adobe is a good example of this.</q>"  

<p>
Roberson seems to be taking a
pragmatic approach to getting InfiniBand support into current versions
of FreeBSD.  Evidently there is an InfiniBand stack that runs on earlier
versions of FreeBSD, but it hasn't been maintained for more recent
kernels.  There aren't any real alternatives, as he sees it:
<div class="BigQuote">
Our options are, to leave FreeBSD users without infiniband, which I can
tell you has cost us more market share as I know of specific cases we have
lost due to it.  To maintain our own stack independently, which no one has
the budget for.  Or to try to integrate with OFED.  Do you see some other
approach?
</div>
</p>

<p>
So far, there has been no answer to his question.  It may be that the
compatibility layer continues to live in the InfiniBand tree, rather than
move to a more widely accessible place, but there
seems to be no one stepping up to develop and maintain a FreeBSD-specific
stack. While there is some resistance to the 10,000-line size of
the layer, it is, for the most part, a pretty thin shim, as Roberson describes:
<div class="BigQuote">
Let's talk nuts and bolts about what this thing does.  In the vast majority
of cases it simply shuffles arguments and function names around where there
is a 1:1 correlation between linux api and FreeBSD API.  Think about things
like atomics, callouts, locks, jiffies vs ticks, etc.  In these areas the
systems are trivially different.  In a very small number of areas where
this wasn't the case I did a direct port and noted it with an #ifdef.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It wasn't brought up in the thread, but there may also be questions about
the license of the compatibility layer (seemingly BSD-only) at some point.  Lawyers might argue that
it is a derivative work of the Linux kernel.  It's unlikely to be a real
problem unless someone takes the code into a closed-source product, which
is something that the BSD license allows.  Specifically licensing it
under the GPL would avoid that particular problem, though that might not
fit well with the goals of the FreeBSD project.

<p>
It is undoubtedly galling to some in the FreeBSD community to adopt a big
chunk of Linux code along with a Linux mapping layer, but the reality is
that the 
community isn't large enough to go it alone, at least for InfiniBand.  In
some ways it is reminiscent of the <a href="/Articles/296444/">problems</a>
that came about when the new direct rendering manager (DRM) development
process was announced.  In both cases, the community of FreeBSD users and
developers is just not large enough to justify some kind of dual-OS
approach.  
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, though, in both cases the licenses specifically allow
Linux and FreeBSD (and others) to incorporate the code.  While there are
lots of technical and development process barriers to more collaboration
between Linux and the BSD world, the usually painful license
incompatibility issue did not rear its head.  With luck, that will play out
well for both sides, with dual-licensed patches going in both directions,
hopefully without the <a href="/Articles/250424/">rancor</a> that sometimes
occurs. 
</p>

If the Linux compatibility layer is a success in the FreeBSD kernel, perhaps one day we will see a similar effort to provide a compatibility layer for older device drivers in newer versions of the Linux kernel, or vice versa.<br>

Is it at all possible that problems like this might encourage some remerging of the various BSD forks?  That always seemed to me like the biggest problem they have, splitting their efforts that way.  In fact, the very first linux system I used was partly because I had no idea what the BSD folks were doing; it seemed like they were more interested in being pure than realistic.<br>

To me the better way would seem to be to better separate the OS-dependent and the OS-independent parts of the drivers.  However I understand that the Linux kernel people frown on this, despite the way they like to highlight how much the kernel code quality improved when it was ported to run on other CPUs/platforms.<br>

There is nothing at all wrong with that or frowned about, if the design is done right. XFS is a pretty good example of this. What is discouraged is having the OS dependent code for other OSes merged in the Linux kernel tree.<br>

      This is interesting. We have been working on and off for some time now to create an OS independent Linux kernel blob that you can link with your application or driver. You can find the source code <a href=http://github.com/lkl>here</a> (together with some proof of concept drivers and applications) and a paper about it  
<a href=https://github.com/lkl/lkl-linux-2.6/raw/master/Documentation/lkl/lkl_roedunet2010.pdf>here</a>.

Good test automation is a blessing that saves developers from repetitive
tasks, reduces bugs introduced by human errors and, at the same time,
decreases testing costs in the long term.
<a href="http://linux-test-project.github.io/">Linux test project</a>
(LTP) is an established project that aims to bring test automation to Linux
kernel development.

<p>
In this article, I will briefly introduce LTP along with its history and structure. A
second article will introduce the test library API. The motivation for
writing them is to help kernel developers with the unpopular and
sometimes neglected task of software testing. 
Increasing test coverage improves the development process, reducing the development
effort and making software updates more predictable. This keeps developers happy by
making more time available for the development of new interesting technologies and
features.
</p>

<h4>A bit of history and the current state</h4>

<p>
LTP was started in 2000 as a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010712183524/http://ltp.sourceforge.net/">joint open-source project by IBM, SGI, and OSDL</a>
and was later joined by other interested parties. In 2001 it contained about 100
simple system call tests and a few test suites collected from other sources. As of
today, it's maintained by SUSE, Red Hat, Fujitsu, and Oracle and gets
contributions from a number of other companies and hobbyists.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the project has always been "<q>to validate the reliability,
robustness, and stability of Linux</q>". As that motto suggests,
LTP focuses on functionality, regression, and stress testing for the Linux
kernel and related features. Neither running benchmarks nor analyzing benchmark
results are supported and there is no plan to add that support to LTP.
Readers interested in benchmarks are advised to look into
<a href="https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests">MMTests</a> developed by Mel
Gorman.
</p>

<p>
A big problem for LTP is that the project goal is a bit too broad. There
are two subproblems to that. The first is that LTP is relatively large
(roughly 4000 C source files and around 500 shell 
scripts). Due to the size of the project, the content has historically varied in
quality and quantity. Developers had complained about the unreliability of some
of the tests. In recent years, significant effort has been spent on cleaning up
that heritage, which dated back to the days of Unix wars. This was a reflection of
the fact that IBM and SGI ported some of the code that became LTP from their
commercial Unixes and released it under the GPL. Developers who tried
LTP in the past and were unhappy with the experience are strongly encouraged to
download a recent version and reevaluate. 

<p>
The second problem is completeness.
LTP covers fair number of system calls, ioctls, sysfs, procfs interfaces, etc. but,
given that the only documentation for some kernel interfaces is pieces of
source code scattered around various subsystems, even estimating the coverage is
a difficult task. Unfortunately, even the documentation we have is sometimes
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/docs/man-pages/man-pages.git/commit/?id=19402081af473eb70d21fbb8b89e1533c6456511">incomplete</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6900807c6b95dcb004902302b8ac5dbfbf6feb89">misleading</a>, or
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/docs/man-pages/man-pages.git/commit/?id=a2cf88983114837a0673a00f76d12232d1606e07">wrong</a>.
</p>

<p>
To give at least some impression of the coverage, which is quite possibly
misleading, we can look at the overall
number of test cases. The
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltp/files/LTP%20Source/ltp-20140828/ltp-full-20140828.tar.bz2/download">latest stable tarball</a>,
released in August, contains 1047 system call test cases, 1605 POSIX
conformance tests in a well-maintained fork of the <a
href="http://posixtest.sourceforge.net/">Open Posix Test Suite</a>,
a realtime test suite, various I/O stress tests (roughly 400), and network-related
test cases, along with nearly a hundred test cases covering control groups (cgroups), various
cgroup controllers,
and namespaces.
</p>

<h4>LTP design goals</h4>
<p>
LTP is designed to be dead simple;
the primary design goals are:
<ul class="spacylist">
 <li>Each test is an executable.</li>
 <li>Each test is as self-contained as possible.</li>
 <li>Each test covers a well-defined assertion
     or a small group of similar assertions.</li>
 <li>Each test runs automatically.
   (There is no need for manual setup nor input during the test run.)</li>
 <li>Overall test status is passed as an exit value.</li>
 <li>Additional information is printed to stdout.</li>
 <li>Global parameters are passed via environment variables.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
From the technical standpoint the languages of choice are C and portable
shell. LTP adopted the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">Linux kernel coding style</a>
and the development process centers around patch review on the
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ltp-list">mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h4>Getting and installing LTP</h4>

<p>
All released tarballs are stored on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltp/files/LTP%20Source/">SourceForge</a>.
These are time-based releases, made four times per year. Before the release
of a tarball, the main
repository is frozen for anything other than fixes for a week or two while
the latest code is tested on several distributions.
</p>

<p>
Then there is a Git repository on
<a href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp">GitHub</a> that is
updated nearly daily and, depending on how far it is from the previous release, it
contains a few tens of new test cases and hundreds of fixes. Therefore, the latest
Git is more suitable for testing upstream kernels than is the released tarball that
may be a few months old. The Git code may be broken sometimes though,
especially on older, but still maintained, distributions when the kernel is missing
some of the functionality that the newly introduced test cases are testing.
</p>

<p>
The installation process is pretty straightforward. The build configuration is
done with an autotools <tt>configure</tt> script and the build is managed with
<tt>make</tt>. LTP, by default, installs its files into <tt>/opt/ltp/</tt>
where you will also find scripts to run the tests.
</p>

To compile and install LTP from a Git snapshot you should do:
<pre>
    $ git clone https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git
    $ cd ltp
    $ make autotools
    $ ./configure
    $ make -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
    $ sudo make install
</pre>

<h4>How to run LTP</h4>

<p>
Single test cases can be executed directly just by executing the binaries.  A
few of them will need <tt>$CWD</tt> in <tt>$PATH</tt> or additional parameters.
If you are looking for a documentation on a particular test case, the best place
to look is in the comment at the start of the test case source code.
</p>

<p>
To run a set of test cases and to get a log file of the output you will
need  to use a test driver.
By default, the test driver runs the default test
<a href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/tree/master/scenario_groups/default">scenario</a>,
which is a set of
<a href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/tree/master/runtest">runtest files</a> to execute.
All runtest files that are part of the default scenario should contain
reasonably stable tests. You will likely want to run only a particular subset of
the runtest file(s) depending on the focus of the testing.
</p>

<p>
Although the test driver works well, there is
still a room for improvement. For example, integrating the Open POSIX
Test Suite that, at the moment, can only be executed separately.
</p>

<p>
The main run script is installed by default at <tt>/opt/ltp/runltp</tt>. This
script is a wrapper around the <tt>ltp-pan</tt> test driver that runs test cases
according to the runtest files.
The <tt>runltp</tt> scripts has many optional parameters. Those used frequently
include <tt>-f&nbsp;filename</tt> that selects only a single runtest file,
<tt>-s&nbsp;regexp</tt> that runs only test cases whose name fits the regular expression,
<tt>-d&nbsp;/tmpdir</tt> that selects a temporary directory for the test cases, and
<tt>-g&nbsp;filename.html</tt> that causes <tt>runltp</tt> to produce HTML
output into the file name given.
</p>

<p>
The script is expected to be executed as root and the execution times range
from minutes to hours, depending on a set of tests to be executed and the
speed of the system under test.
After the test run, the results can be located under the <tt>result</tt> directory;
there is also a list of failed test cases located under the <tt>output</tt>
directory.
</p>

<p>
Historically, LTP contained test cases that were expected to fail. This is no
longer true, with the exception of
<a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13701">three</a>
<tt>pthread_rwlock</tt> Open POSIX test cases. If any other LTP test case
fails, it's either bug 
in the system or in the test—in either case it needs to be reported and
fixed.
</p>

<h4>Who uses LTP</h4>

<p>
Here at SUSE we mostly use the latest stable tarball as a part of the enterprise
kernel validation for releases as well as for maintenance updates. Most
of the time, that finds subtle changes in the interface between kernel and
user space
that either ends up as a test case fix or as a legitimate kernel bug. From my
experience, kernel bugs are less common; although, as more and more test cases are
fixed, the percentage of legitimate bugs grows as well.
</p>

<p>
To find out about the rest of the Linux world, I started a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ltp/mailman/message/33021488/">survey</a>
on the LTP mailing list which was quite successful—see for yourself
the responses I got.  Several indicated that LTP was used as part of
automated testing of kernels, especially on non-x86 architectures.  Others
use subsets of the tests as a kind of smoke test that are typically limited
to a short run duration (a few hours at most).  
In addition, LTP has been <a href="/Articles/597351/">mentioned</a>
as one of the tools used when Linux was ported to the K1 architecture.
</p>

Another use of LTP worth of mentioning is its
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ltp/mailman/message/33021541/">recent integration</a>
with the
LKP+ project
(also known as the <a href="/Articles/514278/">0-day kernel testing
infrastructure</a>).  That testing framework can catch bugs
and determine which kernel commits are responsible, even before the commits
reach a kernel release. 
Beyond that, here are a few upstream kernel commits that mentioned LTP in their Git commit log
for 2014:
<ul class="spacylist">

</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
Although it wasn't easy, LTP has came a long way to what we have today and,
as you can see, 
it already has been a useful tool for testing. Hopefully this article explained
where we were and where we are today. That should get you started on
running the tests;  the
next article will introduce the test library and will help with
writing test cases.

People have not been running LTP enough. Remember the leap second of doom bug in 2012? <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/504744/">http://lwn.net/Articles/504744/</a> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/509207/">http://lwn.net/Articles/509207/</a><br>
<p>
It turned out this bug was entirely avoidable if LTP was run beforehand and the results were analyzed for the leap second situation. After the bug happened, I ran LTP with leap second transition, and immediately multiple time and lock related POSIX tests failed or caused kernel hang. That meant nobody had ever run LTP for the leap second situation or had not seriously looked at the results if they did.<br>

That just tests "does the kernel build and boot successfully" for a few configurations, IIRC. It needs to be fast because it tests many commits appearing in various git trees.<br>

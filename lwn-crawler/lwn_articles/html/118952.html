<h1>Linux kernel security</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
There has been a surprising series of kernel security problems reported
over the last week.  These include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/118955/">uselib() vulnerability</a> disclosed
     by Paul Starzetz.  A locking mistake in an old and mostly unused
     system call creates a race condition which can be exploited to change
     protections on memory - and compromise the system.  The exploit has
     not been released, but Mr. Starzetz claims that the race is relatively
     easy to exploit by first consuming large amounts of memory to force
     the kernel to sleep in the right spot.
<p>
<li> Paul Starzetz also discovered <a href="/Articles/118964/">a race
     condition in the page fault handler</a> which can only be exploited on
     SMP systems.  If two threads tried to expand the same downward-growing
     memory segment at the same time, the result could be an exploitable
     corruption of the page tables.
<p>
<li> The grsecurity team, frustrated at a seeming lack of interest in
     security problems among the kernel developers, <a
     href="/Articles/118251/">disclosed five vulnerabilities</a> at once.
     One of these is a denial-of-service problem where users could lock
     more than the authorized amount of memory into physical RAM; as it
     turns out, the kernel developers <a href="/Articles/118972/">still are
     not overly concerned</a> about that problem.  The other
     vulnerabilities require root access (or at least access to physical
     devices) to exploit; one of them is in a driver which does not compile
     in 2.6.
</ul>
<p>

Fixes for the first two vulnerabilities have been merged into the
pre-2.6.11 BitKeeper repository; the last set will be fixed as well, but
with less urgency.  Fixes can also be found in <a
href="/Articles/118465/">the -ac tree</a> and in the updated kernels being
issued by distributors.
<p>

One concern that has been raised by these disclosures is that the new
kernel development model, by encouraging such large changes between
releases, is allowing the creation of more security problems.  While that
worry could yet prove to be justified, all of the vulnerabilities listed
above, with the exception of the <tt>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</tt> denial of service
problem,  are present in the 2.4 kernel as well.  They were not introduced
or enabled by the new development model.
<p>

Another concern is more valid, however: the kernel development project does
not have an official security contact or process for handling security
problems.  Developers who know how the kernel process works have no trouble
getting consideration for security-related problems and patches, but the
whole process looks far more opaque to the rest of the world.  There is a
clear need for an easily-found contact for kernel security issues.  Chris
Wright, who has done a fair amount of security-related kernel work, is <a
href="/Articles/118976/">pushing for improvements in this area</a>, and,
most importantly, has volunteered to do much of the work.  So chances are
this problem will not last much longer.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Indeed it is. I haven't been able to make it actually work though. The exploit forks off some threads, eats LOTS of memory, uses a lot of cpu power, and then fails. Again and again.<br>
<p>
The exploit does seem to fork off one more thread each time it is run, so it must be doing something to the kernel memory.<br>
<p>
However, this exploit won't go unnoticed on your machine. Just watch for huge load spikes.<br>

      What I'd really like to see is an area on kernel.org for "official" versions of security patches for stable kernels (ie. the latest of 2.4/2.6 at present).<br>
<p>
It's all very nice having someone say "It's in changeset foo in BK tree bar", or "it's in 2.4.33-rc3", but that's awfully fiddly if *all* you want is the security patch for the current stable kernel you're running. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not in the habit of running -rc versions on production machines.<br>
<p>
It's one of those things where a relatively small amount of work for the person merging the patch can save every distributor, big or small, quite a bit of work having to figure it out and backport it.<br>

      I second that. I usually try to get the patches from the advisories, or, e.g., from RedHat RPMS, because then they are self-contained. <br>
<p>
Especially if you add other patches (most notably grsec) upgrading is always quite a bit of work. The best way would be to get the patches, slamm them in, adjust if they conflict with previous patches, and rebuild. <br>

      Is it just me who finds Linus attitude shown in the linux-kernel thread     <br>
started by Chris Wright a bit irresponsible?  <br>
While reading it, I sometimes felt he hasn't realized that Linux isn't his <br>
personal hobby anymore, but that there are millions of user of kernel.org <br>
and vendor kernels, whose security partly depends on responsible handling <br>
of kernel vulnerabilities. So that you shouldn't make them dependant on <br>
your own personal pet views or distaste for some politics.    <br>

      A quote of Linus from the above thread:<br>
<p>
(See <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/270044">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/270044</a> for the full article.)<br>
<p>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
The only thing I really care about is that we can serve the people who<br>
depend on us by giving them source code that is as bug-free and secure as <br>
we can make it. If that means that we should make the changelogs be a bit <br>
less verbose because we don't want to steal the thunder from the people <br>
who found the problem, that's fine.<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<p>
I suspect that you may be revising your views.  Linus takes a strong "let's minimise the window of vulnerability" line.  That would appear to be in everyone's best interest.<br>

      But his view is totally inconsistent in this regard. He doesn't realize <br>
users don't want to disclosure to happen until vendor kernels are ready. <br>
First he says he only carer about giving users the most bug-free code <br>
possible, then he says maybe it doesn't matter that the kernel.org kernel <br>
gets security fixes last.  <br>

      You're projecting your own opinion on the rest of us.  I am a user of Linux and I don't give a flying handshake about vendor kernels or their users.  It is in the best interest of me and my business to have complete knowledge of all risks associated with the software we use.  We need to be perfectly informed to make good operating decisions.  <br>

      But his stand doesn't help you in any respect either. His attachment to <br>
his views means he doesn't work with vendor-sec. Which means official <br>
kernel.org kernels get released with known security holes. Check Alan Cox' <br>
emails in the lkml thread. <br>

      Speaking as a user I could care less about vendor kernels.  I want the<br>
fix out as fast as possible.  If that means disclosing the vulnerability<br>
or, more likely, giving enough information (from the patch) for someone<br>
to figure it out then that's ok with me.  Waiting on vendors could get<br>
very ugly... which vendors first of all.  What if one of them takes weeks<br>
to get the patch released?  What if they only do quarterly updates?  What<br>
about regression testing?  I don't want to wait on those things.<br>

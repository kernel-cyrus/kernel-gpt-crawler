The Friday morning linux.conf.au keynote was delivered by Australian
expatriate Andrew Morton; his wide-ranging talk touched on many aspects of
the kernel development process.
<p>

Andrew has brought a different approach to kernel development, and it
showed early in the talk.  He noted that Linus has often characterized his
job as being rejecting patches, rather than accepting them.  Andrew
disagrees with that approach.  If somebody has gone to the trouble to put
together a patch, even a really poorly-done one, there was probably some
sort of underlying need which motivated that work.  A patch identifies a
problem, at least for some users; you can't just reject it or the kernel as
a whole will lose out.  So Andrew sees his role as helping to get patches
into the kernel, rather than taking pride in rejecting them.
According to Andrew, anybody who goes to the trouble of submitting a patch
deserves a response. 
If the patch is not merged, the developer is entitled to an explanation of
why.  
<p>

He does not want to have to understand all of those patches himself,
however.  It's up to the subsystem maintainers to evaluate patches and,
eventually, merge them.  Andrew's job is to get the maintainers to get

<a href="/Articles/133297/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/lca2005/akpm-talk-sm.jpg" width=144 height=162
alt="[Andrew Morton]" align="left" border=0></a>

involved.  Techniques he can employ include the "troll merge," simply
adding the patch to -mm to force the maintainer to react.  Asking "dumb
questions" on the mailing lists can also help.  One way or another, Andrew
works to get a response from the relevant maintainers.

<p>
Andrew's goal is to bring more professionalism to the kernel development
process.  He believes that is happening; among other things, he notes,
patch traffic now slows down significantly on weekends - that was not
always the case.  He'd like to settle down the process, and, eventually,
hand off pieces of it to others.  One such piece, most likely, would be bug
tracking.  He cautioned, however, that these kernel maintenance tasks are
not part-time jobs.

<p>
The new development model was revisited; much of what was said will be
familiar to LWN readers.  He noted that the older process failed one of the
kernel's most important customers: the distributors.  By getting features
merged, tested, and ready for deployment quickly, the new process serves
the distributors better.  There has, perhaps, been some cost to another set
of customers: those who run the mainline kernel on their systems.  Andrew
will be working hard to increase the stability of the mainline releases to
make life easier for that group of users.
<p>

Meanwhile, he notes, the developers are shoveling about 10MB of patches
into the kernel every month.

<p>
The stable 2.6 series (currently at 2.6.11.7) is, according to Andrew, not
sure to succeed.  He believes that it does not get enough developer
attention, and that the bar for patches has been set too high.  And it does
not address the real problem: that mainline releases have regressions that
cause breakage for some users.  Really fixing the problems, he says,
requires getting the developers to be more careful and more focus on fixing
known bugs.  He says the process might yet move to an even/odd release
scheme, where even-numbered releases (2.6.14, say) would be limited to bug
fixes.
<p>

On testing: Andrew notes that, while the development process is highly
dependent on a large community of testers, it has no real way of rewarding
them for their work.  He will look into acknowledging testers in the kernel
changelogs; if you helped to find a bug, your name can appear alongside
that of the developer who fixed it.
<p>


On the BitKeeper front, Andrew stated that he was never entirely happy with
the decision to use that tool.  It imposed an opportunity cost: had the
kernel hackers gone off three years ago to build the source code management
system they really needed, they would have something quite nice by now.  He
noted that version control appears to be one of those problems which drives
developers crazy, and that's a problem.  If you depend on a tool with
insane developers, things will "end in tears."  Now he's keeping his head
down and waiting to see how the whole thing settles out.
<p>
Finally, he noted that many developers who think they need a source code
management system really don't.  If your real purpose is to keep a set of
patches in sync with an evolving mainline kernel - which is the case for
many developers - then a tool like <a

So who, aside from Linus himself, actually really supported using BitKeeper as a development tool?

      Quite a few maintainers really like bit keeper.  I liked poking through the bit keeper website and reading change logs.  Source control seems like a good idea in my books.<br>
<p>
As far as I know people were pretty careful not to force anyone to use bit keeper who didn't want to.  People were all like, "Yeah.  You say that now but see how long it goes before everyone has to start using bit keeper."  It seems that these people were completely wrong and that Linus and Co kept their word.<br>

<p>
Now that's a curious way of putting it.
Linux and co "kept their word" because they were forced to
by McVoy withdrawing bitkeeper - and Linus has been vocally
and publically blaming the wrong person.

how bitkeeper stopped being used has nothing to do with Linus and Co keeping their word that they would not force anyone to use bitkeeper<br>

      but the point was that nobody would be required to access the repository if they didn't agree to the bitkeeper license as the data was made available through other means (and it was made available, eventually even to the satisfaction of the bk critics)<br>

      I am one developer who was discouraged from contributing to the kernel by the use of bitkeeper. In early 2.6 days I tried to get involved in bringing mpc8xx embedded pcc sub-architecture up to speed because it was lagging behind, and the maintainer Dan Malek told me he was not really interested in patches unless they were against his own bitkeeper tree. He would rather do the work himself than use patches generated against the latest in CVS.<br>

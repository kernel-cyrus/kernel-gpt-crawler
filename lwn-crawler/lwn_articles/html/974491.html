           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 22, 2024</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The kernel's <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html">hugetlbfs
subsystem</a> was the first mechanism by which the kernel made huge pages
available to user space; it was added to the 2.5.46 development kernel in
2002.  While hugetlbfs remains useful, it is also viewed as a sort of
second memory-management subsystem that would be best unified with the rest
of the kernel.  At the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Peter Xu raised the
question of what that unification would involve and what the first steps
might be.
<p>
In theory, the kernel's transparent huge page mechanism makes hugetlbfs
unnecessary.  There are, though, reasons for the longevity of hugetlbfs.
It allows huge pages to be reserved, so that they will remain available
even if system memory as a whole is fragmented.  It also implements
page-table sharing across multiple processes, which is not otherwise
available in Linux (a later LSFMM+BPF session talked about <a
href="/Articles/895217/"><tt>mshare()</tt></a>, which is meant to fill that
gap).  And, of course, software has been written using the hugetlbfs ABI,
so it must continue to be supported.
<p>
<h4>Consolidation</h4>
<p>
Xu began by saying that his objective was not to remove hugetlbfs, but to
consolidate it into the rest of the memory-management subsystem.  There are
11 different code paths that are specific to hugetlbfs; he thinks that can
be reduced to two or three.  Making hugetlbfs into an ordinary filesystem
is not a goal; doing so would likely increase complexity for little
benefit.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/974509/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/PeterXu-sm.png" alt="[Peter Xu]"
title="Peter Xu" class="rthumb"></a>

Hugetlbfs, thus, will remain a "special", RAM-based filesystem.  It is, he
said, ancient stuff, much of which is aimed at use cases that may not even
exist anymore.  But developers are afraid to touch it.  Hugetlbfs is a
maintenance nightmare, inflicting its special code paths on the rest of the
kernel; users have requested new features, but they have been rejected out
of fear of increasing the complexity of the system.  So, he said, there is
no time like the present to deal with this problem.  Fortunately, the
large-folio work is making it easier to coalesce at least some of the
hugetlbfs code into the rest of the kernel.
<p>
Xu wondered whether this work should be done by creating a new, better
version of hugetlbfs, or by working to unify the existing code.  His feeling,
though, is that a new version would not be justified; there is no need for
any sort of ABI break, which would be the biggest reason to start over.
Unifying hugetlbfs means working with an ugly ABI implemented by ugly code,
but starting over would bring an entirely different kind of pain.
<p>
David Hildenbrand agreed that the hugetlbfs ABI is ugly; for him, though,
the biggest problem is all of the "<tt>if&nbsp;(hugetlbfs)</tt>" calls
sprinkled through the rest of the memory-management subsystem.  Many of
these tests are driven by alignment requirements.  Creating a new version
of hugetlbfs would be too much, he said, but there would be value in being
able to set a flag to remove some of the hugetlbfs restrictions; that would
make it possible to, for example, free half of a hugetlb folio.  Xu agreed
with that view.
<p>
Hildenbrand mentioned <a href="/Articles/931773/">high-granularity
mapping</a> as a proposed hugetlbfs enhancement that ended up being
rejected out of fear of adding more hugetlbfs-related complexity to the
memory-management subsystem.  Rather than add special-case exceptions like
that, he said, it would be better to just drop the hugetlbfs restrictions
everywhere.  Michal Hocko, though, asked the group to take a step back
and summarize the features that are actually needed.  Hugetlbfs came about
in a time when transparent huge pages didn't exist; perhaps it would be
better to make more use of transparent huge pages than to add more
hugetlbfs features.
<p>
Xu answered that the use of transparent huge pages has its own performance
impact; the realtime configuration disables it, for example.  There are
also use cases that insist on 1GB huge pages, and hugetlbfs is the only way
get them in current kernels.  He would, he said, be happy to see a proposal
based on transparent huge pages that addresses those concerns.
<p>
<h4>The 1GB page reservation</h4>
<p>
John Hubbard said that there are a lot of artificial-intelligence
applications out there that can benefit from huge pages; some of those
applications need huge pages badly, and so they use hugetlbfs.  Others can
just take advantage of the kernel's improving transparent huge page support
and get faster with no additional effort.  There are, he suspects, some
applications out there that have been well tuned and benefit from not
having to wait for the kernel to collapse their memory into transparent
huge pages.  Some applications will always need huge pages that are always
available.
<p>
A remote participant said that hugetlbfs is often most useful to allocate
memory for virtual machines; this use case really wants the 1GB guarantee
that hugetlbfs can provide.  In this case, the 1GB aspect is the only thing
that matters.  Another remote attendee said that the
high-granularity-mapping code was an attempt to add transparent huge page
features to hugetlbfs, but that it would be better to support 1GB huge
pages in the core memory-management subsystem than to add more hugetlbfs
features.
<p>
Jason Gunthorpe said that he would really like to see the hugetlbfs code
taken out of the core; after that, he doesn't care about any "craziness"
hidden within it.  Matthew Wilcox said that the biggest problem is the
hugetlbfs page-table walker, which has a lot of special cases and needs to
be gotten rid of, somehow.
<p>
Xu tried to reach a sort of conclusion by saying that there is still sense
in having a separate allocator that can provide the guarantees that some
applications need.  But, he said, if he cannot implement high-granularity
mappings on top of that allocator, he will lose a lot of his motivation to
do this work.  Hildenbrand said that, if this work is done right,
high-granularity mappings should just come naturally.
<p>
Xu continued, saying that anybody who wants partial mappings in hugetlbfs
should go ahead and post a patch; it will be interesting to see how that
works with the 1GB-page allocator.  There is still a need for a better
interface to consume hugetlbfs pages, though.  Gunthorpe said that <a
href="/Articles/593918/">memfd</a> is that interface; it just needs to be
taught how to reach into hugetlbfs, which could provide a single
reservation for all users needing 1GB pages.  Hildenbrand said that plans
for <a href="/Articles/949277/"><tt>guest_memfd()</tt></a> need a number of the
proposed features, including partial mappings and high-granularity mapping.
Gunthorpe added that there is merit in separating the various hugetlbfs
components; the 1GB page pool is generally useful and should be a separate
feature.  In general, users want the reservation feature, but would rather
do without a "screwy ABI".  Accessing the reservation with an
<tt>mmap()</tt> flag would be nice, he said.
<p>
Dan Williams read a suggestion from the online chat: hugetlbfs should be
removed and reimplemented as an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>
option on the tmpfs filesystem.  Xu said that, in that case, the challenge
would be getting users to move over; a deprecation process would be needed.
Another participant said that adding hugetlbfs features to tmpfs would
require unifying the page-table walker.
<p>
Gunthorpe said that, once features become available in the core
memory-management subsystem, everything else just falls into place.  A new
ABI could then be simply implemented as a memfd <tt>ioctl()</tt> call
providing access to the 1GB-page reservation.  Hocko, though, said that
pushing users away from hugetlbfs would take 15 to 20&nbsp;years; it is
better to just leave it in place, clean up its internals, and make them
usable elsewhere.
<p>
For 1GB pages, Xu said, the mechanism is already in place; all that is
needed is to expose a better ABI for it.  Hildenbrand suggested, again,
simply dropping the restrictions on hugetlbfs pages, allowing 1GB huge
pages to be mapped as needed.  Xu continued that existing users do not see
the hugetlbfs ABI as ugly; they are happily using it.  The
memory-management developers, instead, are not happy with it; is that a
sufficient reason to introduce a new ABI?
<p>
As this (two-slot) session ran out of time, Hildenbrand mentioned the
strange semantics that hugetlbfs imposes on <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> mappings.
Among other things, that makes it impossible to insert a uprobe or a
breakpoint in a hugetlbfs 1GB page.  He said that it was clear that Xu
would have to clean up the page-table walker, but that the kernel would
have to continue to provide hugetlbfs as it is, since there are users out
there.
<P>
<h4>The next steps</h4>
<p>
The discussion was not done, though; another slot was scheduled later in
the day.  Xu got more deeply into the details, saying that, in his first
attempt, he was trying to clean up the <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> code path
(which is the way that the kernel maps user-space pages).  After some work,
that project was mostly successful; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240321220802.679544-1-peterx@redhat.com/">patches</a>
have been posted and since merged for the 6.10 release.
<p>
There are numerous challenges remaining, though.  One of those is the
"hugepd" mechanism used by the PowerPC architecture to handle huge pages.
Hugepd is imposed by that architecture's special page-table requirements,
but it can evidently be gotten out of the way for huge pages, simplifying
the unification of the code.  Christophe Leroy has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1715971869.git.christophe.leroy@csgroup.eu/">a
patch set</a> doing that work; Xu would like some help reviewing it.
<p>
Huge pages can be represented in three ways in the kernel, he said.  They
can be a huge mapping as defined by the architecture (a PMD-level mapping,
for example), the "cont-pte" format (where the huge page is mapped as base
pages, but with a special flag set to tell the CPU that a group of
physically contiguous pages exists — see <a href="/Articles/937239/">this
article</a>), and the PowerPC hugepd format.  The page-table-walker ABI
supports only the first two of them.  Unification requires adding generic
support for hugepd, or just removing it; the latter approach is the
direction taken by Leroy's patch set, but it needs to be extended to remove
hugepd completely.
<p>
A generic page-table walker that handles all cases would be an elegant
solution, he said, if it could be achieved.  Wilcox said that work needs to
be done to make page-table walkers easier to write, starting with figuring
out what all the needs are.  Gunthorpe agreed, noting that the kernel is
full of duplicated page-table-walking code.  It would be good to abstract
out the details to create a generic ABI; Wilcox said he was tempted to just
try it.
<p>
Xu asked the group if there was a need to support P4D huge pages; these are
mapped one page-table-level higher than 1GB pages, and are 512GB in size.
Wilcox said that 512GB pages would be ridiculous, with no practical use;
the consensus in the room was that there was no need to support that size
anytime soon.
<p>
As time (once again) ran low, Xu said that it may never be possible to
unify all of the hugetlbfs paths in the kernel; he may have to just give up
on some of them.  Page-fault handling and PMD-level page-table sharing may
be cases in point.  There are some hugetlbfs quirks to work around. For
example, a read on a <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> page does not result in a
page-cache entry; instead, it creates a read-only anonymous page.  It makes
no sense to port features like this to generic code, he said.
<p>
Wilcox agreed that there was no problem with not unifying quirks like that;
they don't affect other users of the system.  The PMD-sharing problem is
better solved with <tt>mshare()</tt>.  Perhaps the page-table sharing
supported by hugetlbfs could eventually be dropped, he said.

Xu concluded by listing a set of paths that he intends to address in the
near future.  These included page-table walking, handling <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
faults, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html"><tt>mprotect()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html"><tt>mremap()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><tt>fork()</tt></a>,
and more.  Some of those, he noted, would be difficult.  The session ended
with Wilcox expressing his thanks to Xu for addressing this "long overdue"
problem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One thing I never understood about hugepages is why they are connected to a filesystem _at_ all.<br>
<p>
Do you ask for 4 KiB pages by mounting stuff and mapping files there? No! You just mmap them.<br>
<p>
Another thing I learned about using MAP_HUGE is that 2 hugepage VMAs next to each other don't merge by default.<br>

It was “a product of its time”. Early 2.x kernels didn't have most of the autotuning we take for granted nowadays, and this was a way to have *something* to let people squeeze out an extra 5% from their hardware using a fairly obscure feature.<br>
<p>
Nowadays we have THP and madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) and neither needs hugetlbfs so it's a lot less important than it once was, but it's userspace API and in active use so it'll probably stick around for a good while to come.<br>
<p>
And I mildly disagree - more things ought to be exposed as filesystems. I think networking innards should've been, for one, but I doubt that mountain will budge in 2024.<br>

Honestly the madvice() path is by far the best way forward in almost all circumstances. The only 'gap' being sharing pages between processes (not threads) at this time unless/until the mshare() approach lands.<br>

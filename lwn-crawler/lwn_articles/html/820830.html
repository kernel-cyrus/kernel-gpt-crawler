<a href="/Articles/820337/">OSPM</a>
</div>
Developers of safety-critical systems tend to avoid Linux kernels for a
number of fairly obvious reasons; Linux simply was not developed with that
sort of use case in mind.  There are increasingly compelling reasons to use
Linux in such systems, though, leading to a search for the best way to do
so safely.  At the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), José Martins described <a
href="https://github.com/bao-project/bao-hypervisor">Bao</a>, a minimal
hypervisor aimed at safety-critical deployments.
<p>
The actual target, he began, is "mixed-criticality" systems in which multiple
software stacks run in parallel with each other; some of those stacks are
safety-critical, while others are not.  For example, a system could have a
user interface running on Linux alongside the safety-critical application
that it controls.  There is an industry trend toward consolidating systems
in this way driven by power considerations and the availability of
processors with numerous CPUs.
<p>
Virtualization is naturally interesting for the developers of such systems;
it minimizes the effort required to port systems and eases the integration
within them.  Good virtualization provides fault isolation, preventing
failures in one

<a href="/Articles/820832/"><img

title="José Martins" class="rthumb"></a>

part of the system from interfering with others.  Developers want the usual
things from such a system: good performance, realtime guarantees, and
strong security.
<p>
Martins spent some time looking at solutions like Xen and KVM.  They were
not designed for this kind of use case, but they end up being used anyway.
Neither is an optimal solution; they use virtualized I/O mechanisms that
add a lot of overhead, and 
their code bases are large and hard to audit.
<p>
Instead, he said, there is a role here for a static partitioning
hypervisor, which can be seen as a thin configuration layer that divides up
a system's resources.  Under a system like this, there is a one-to-one
mapping between virtual CPUs and physical CPUs, so there is no contention
for CPU time.  Devices are mapped directly into the guests, avoiding any
added I/O overhead.  Perhaps the best-known hypervisor of this type is <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse">Jailhouse</a>, but that didn't
meet Martins's needs; it depends on a Linux "root cell" to run the whole
show, its boot time is relatively long, and there is still a big code base
to audit.  The <a
href="https://xenproject.org/2019/12/16/true-static-partitioning-with-xen-dom0-less/">Xen
Dom0-less</a> project can do direct device assignment, which is nice, but
it falls short in other ways.
<p>
So Martins set out to create Bao as a "type-1 bare-metal hypervisor" with a
one-to-one CPU mapping.  It doesn't depend on any sort of privileged
virtual machine or operating system to boot.  Bao provides a simple
inter-VM communication mechanism based on shared memory and virtual
interrupts.  It depends on hardware assistance for many of its functions,
including second-stage address translation, an I/O memory-management unit,
and virtual interrupts.  Bao can use huge pages to reduce translation
lookaside buffer pressure and page-table memory use; it is also able to
perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coloring">cache
coloring</a> for memory allocations to avoid low-level cache
interference between machines.
<p>
Bao currently targets the Armv8 architecture.  There is a RISC-V port, but
the virtualization specification for RISC-V is not ready, so this port is
not interesting yet.  It can run a number of guests, including bare-metal
applications, Linux, Android, and various realtime operating systems.
<p>
Ideally, he said, Bao would just be a configuration layer that does its
work and gets out of the way, but the hardware does not support this mode
of operation.  Interrupts, for example, have to be mediated through the
hypervisor, which is unfortunate since that increases latency.  The I/O
memory-management unit has a limited number of stream registers, and
doesn't cover all devices on some platforms.  There is no partitioning
mechanism for memory cache on Arm, so the hypervisor must handle isolation
via cache coloring.
<p>
The system is implemented in about 7,000 lines of code, and requires 50KB
of memory on the target system. That is "somewhat small", he said, but he
is working to get it smaller.  Run-time memory requirements add up to about
250KB.  Benchmark runs show that the hypervisor adds an
execution-time overhead of about&nbsp;2%.  Turning on cache coloring
increases that 
overhead, since that feature is incompatible with the use of huge pages.
Interference tests currently show a significant amount of degradation
caused by activity in other virtual machines; cache coloring helps but does
not completely solve the problem.
<p>
Another issue is interrupt latency, which increases significantly due to
the need for a round-trip through the hypervisor.  There is a fair amount
of cross-VM interference caused by interrupts as well; again, cache
coloring helps, especially if it is used within the hypervisor too.  He has
found a way to map interrupts directly into guests, something that is made
possible by the one-to-one CPU mapping.  That increases the overhead for
interrupts intended for the hypervisor itself, but those are relatively
rare.
<p>
Current work includes adding support for trusted execution environments.
The other approaches out there share the trusted code across virtual
machines, which is not ideal.  Arm is adding support for a "trusted
hypervisor" mode but, for now, complex workarounds are required.  Martins
said that the "dual-world" approach used in this area is not inherently
secure; a lot of code has to be added to the secure side, bringing the same
old problems with it.  It is better, he said, to limit the secure world to
core security primitives; he is trying to do that by avoiding <a
href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone">TrustZone</a>
completely and dedicating a virtual CPU to trusted work.  This involves allowing
multiple virtual CPUs to run on a single physical CPU.
<p>
Overall, he concluded, Bao has turned out to be a good fit for the intended
use case.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The hypervisor extension is in pretty good shape. The WDC folks has been working on the QEMU/KVM port for quite some time. The latest version can be found here [1]. The spec has been getting a lot of input from KVM maintainer Paolo Bonzini, e.g. [2], which has been added to the specification. In RISC-V land a spec doesn't get ratified until there's silicon to support it. <br>
<p>
Hopefully, we'll get a chip soon! :-)<br>

<h1>A new device naming scheme</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 6, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
A recent <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/79118/">posting</a> on
linux-kernel announced the creation of a new mailing list, hosted at OSDL,
for the discussion of device naming schemes.  The Linux Standard Base does
not currently specify device names, but its maintainers would like to
change that.  To that end, they are seeking input on how devices should be
named on Linux systems.
<p>
The discussion, so far, has centered around a proposal (available <a
href="http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/device_naming/attachments/20040402/1c670d44/layout-draft-0001.pdf">in
PDF format</a>) from SUSE.  Its purpose is to create a set of persistent
device names which will remain valid even in a hotpluggable world where the
hardware configuration can change at any time.  To that end, the proposal
creates a version of <tt>/dev</tt> which is radically different from
anything seen on current Linux systems.
<p>
All of the current device names found in <tt>/dev</tt> are relegated to the
category of "compatibility names."  They will still exist, but the proposal
suggests that they should be maintained by <tt>udev</tt>, rather than being
a static part of the system.  The new names, instead, will all be found in
subdirectories under <tt>/dev</tt>.  Disks will be in <tt>/dev/disk</tt>
(with a "<tt>k</tt>"), and the obvious things will be found in other
directories, such as <tt>/dev/printer</tt>, <tt>/dev/cdrom</tt> (these,
evidently, are not "disks"), or <tt>/dev/modem</tt>.
<p>
The proposal calls for another level of subdirectories before you find any
actual device names.  Each of the <tt>/dev</tt> subdirectories would be
further divided into <tt>by-path</tt>, which names each device by how it is
connected to the system; <tt>by-serial</tt>, which uses the device's model
name and serial number; <tt>by-uuid</tt>, which uses a device's "universal
unique identifier"; and <tt>by-label</tt>, which uses a device's filesystem
label.  Thus, a system's root partition might have all of the
following names:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>/dev/disk/by-path/ide-0.0-part1</tt>
<li> <tt>/dev/disk/by-serial/ata-ST340810A-53-5BIN-part1</tt>
<li> <tt>/dev/disk/by-label/label-ROOT</tt>
<li> <tt>/dev/disk/by-uuid/uuid-0bee1954-b245-4df1-b2af-785fecd75b8f</tt>
</ul>
<p>
The use of multiple names for the same device does not sit well with
everybody; fears have been expressed that it could confuse users and
applications which perform user-space locking by device name.  The
<tt>by-path</tt> names were received critically; since the path can change
on a modern system, those names will never be persistent.  There were also
complaints about <tt>by-label</tt> and <tt>by-uuid</tt>; those names are
meant to allow Linux systems to find and mount disks regardless of their
position in the device hierarchy, but the <tt>mount</tt> utility already
implements that functionality.
<p>
While there have been complaints about the SUSE proposal, there have not,
thus far, been a lot of alternatives put forward.  Something, however, is
clearly going to have to change.  A Fedora Core 2 Test 2 system has almost
19,000 entries under <tt>/dev</tt>; this mass of names can only get larger
and increasingly unmaintainable.  And it fails to address the dynamic
nature of devices in modern systems.  Device naming looks to be an
interesting issue for some time to come.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Um.
</p><p align="justify">
A udev (or devfs) system that creates device nodes on the fly is going to have far fewer entries in /dev. And this proposal calls for udev anyway.
</p><p align="justify">
So this proposal should be compared to just adopting udev, not the current situation: where will it increase complexity and where it will decrease it? And is it worth the tradeoff?

      Why not just go with the Solaris scheme of device names... that should be complicated enough...

      It's not hard to propose a solution better than a static /dev, with the <br>mentioned device proliferation problems, neither is it incredibly <br>difficult to propose a solution better than 2.4's devfs, altho it already <br>solves the worst of the static /dev issues.  However, as James already <br>asked, where's the comparison to udev and a list of problems (other than <br>standardized names, but that's a separate issue) udev doesn't solve that <br>this new SuSE proposal does? <br> <br>Again as James already mentioned, the SuSE proposal already calls for udev <br>anyway, and with it running, the overpopulated /dev issue is already <br>pretty much dealt with.  SuSE can use it to build such a complicated thing <br>on their distrib if desired, but I don't WANT all those extra names on MY <br>system.  In addition, the additional classifications they want are already <br>accessible thru /sys, which udev uses as well, and it shouldn't take much <br>effort to run thru the /sys info itself to grab the desired info and sort <br>it as needed in userspace, with the udev libraries and tools already <br>providing good programmer access to the info.  If they want it organized <br>differently, why not simply patch the existing library interface to <br>provide the desired sort access and leave it at that? <br> <br>Udev is already incredibly flexible, providing most of this functionality <br>if desired and much more.  Why reinvent the wheel here, when simply <br>tweaking the spokes or changing the hub's sleave bearings to ball bearings <br>is all that's needed? <br> <br>Duncan <br>

      This issue can't be a Linux only issue.  What are other OSs doing?  How are they handling the whole device situation?  udev seems to be a workable option but I can't help be feel that there are already existing solutions to this in non-Linux worlds.  Have they been looked at to see if any of them might be worth implimenting?  I mean, it couldn't hurt to look, right?<br>

      <blockquote><i>This issue can't be a Linux only issue. What are other OSs
doing?</i></blockquote>
<p>AIX has a dynamic /dev created by userspace during boot.  Similar to
udev, conceptually.  Hard disks get named <i>hdisk0</i>, <i>hdisk1</i>, etc.
in the order they are detected; after initially being detected by the
system, their UUID or something is stored in a registry (the ODM) so that
they always get the same identifier thereafter.  (This persistence of names
is not even all that important for disks, since AIX almost always uses disks
via its LVM, which has no need to care about device IDs since it uses its
own superblocks.)</p>
<p>So, AIX remembers all the devices it has ever detected on your system -
or been told about via <i>/sbin/mkdev</i>.  Devices it has successfully
initialised are put in the <i>available</i> state, which involves creating
the device node in /dev; devices which were not detected are put in the
<i>defined</i> state, where device nodes in /dev are not automatically
created.  Major numbers are assigned dynamically, I think even for core
stuff like /dev/null.  And if you want to purge old entries from its
database for stuff you no longer have plugged in, you have to do this
manually, with <i>/sbin/rmdev -d</i>.</p>

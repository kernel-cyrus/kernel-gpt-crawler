<h1>How fast should HZ be?</h1>

There has been a debate slowly simmering on linux-kernel over an issue
which, to most Linux users, will be invisible.  Still, it points at the
sorts of tradeoffs which must be made when configuring a system, and thus
merits a look.
<p>

One of the features which will be included in the 2.6.13 kernel is the
ability to configure the frequency of the timer interrupt at kernel build
time - at least, on the i386 architecture.  This capability, by itself, is
not controversial, but the new default value for HZ (250) is.  Some
developers think it is too low, while others (fewer) think it is too high.
It does not appear that there is a single "right" value for this variable.
<p>

HZ is the frequency with which the system's timer hardware is programmed to
interrupt the kernel.  Much of the kernel's internal housekeeping,
including process accounting, scheduler time slice accounting, and internal
time management, is done in the timer interrupt handler.  Thus, the
frequency of the timer interrupt affects a number of things; in particular,
it puts an upper bound on the resolution of timers used with the kernel.
If HZ is 1000 (the i386 default for 2.6 kernels through 2.6.12), then
timers will have a best-case resolution of 1ms.  If, instead, HZ is 100
(the 2.4 and prior default), that resolution is 10ms.  
<p>

The 250Hz default in 2.6.13 gives a maximum timer resolution of 4ms, which
is said to be insufficient for many multimedia-oriented applications (and
others which need higher-resolution timers).  Such applications, in that
environment, will be forced to use busy-waiting to achieve delays which are
below the best resolution offered by the system, with the usual effect on
CPU utilization.  It is not the way the developers of these applications
want to go.
<p>

The arguments in favor of reducing HZ center around efficiency.  A slower
timer interrupt is said to require less power, since the processor (if
relatively idle) will wake up less often.  Thus, a lower value of HZ is
supposed to be better for laptop users.  The timer interrupt handler also
requires CPU time (and a context switch, and cache space) every time it
runs; running that handler less often will clearly reduce its overhead.  
<p>

Part of the problem, however, is that nobody has quantified the savings
which can be expected from a slower timer interrupt.  That changed,
however, when Marc Ballarin posted <a href="/Articles/145980/">some
results</a> from tests he had run.  His initial test, involving an idle
system, showed that power consumption varied from 7.59&nbsp;watts with a
100Hz timer frequency to 8.15W at 1000Hz.  <a href="/Articles/145982/">A
subsequent test</a> with KDE running showed a smaller savings, especially
when <tt>artsd</tt> was running.
<p>

These results have given ammunition to both sides.  Advocates of a low HZ
value see the potential for a half-watt savings as worthwhile.  Those who
want HZ to be high see, instead, a change which makes the system less
effective for them while yielding minimal advantages in real-world use. 
<p>

If there is a consensus on this issue, it would appear to be that the real
solution is the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/138969/">dynamic tick
patch</a>.  By causing timer interrupts to happen only when there is
actually something to be done, the kernel can simultaneously support
higher-resolution timers and reduce the actual incidence of timer
interrupts.  No commitments have been made, but there seems to be a
widely-held opinion that the dynamic tick patch will be merged once it has
been sufficiently cleaned up; some architectures (e.g. ARM) already have
it.  To that end, Con Kolivas has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/145880/">a reworked version</a> of that patch
for review.
<p>

If this patch is to be merged soon, it has been asked, why make a change to
HZ in the mean time?  No answers to that question have been posted.  It is
true that the lower value of HZ has been in the mainline for some time (and
in -mm for even longer) and the number of real complaints has been small.
In the absence of problems noted by a wider group of testers, the default
value of 250 for HZ seems likely to persist into the final 2.6.13 release.
It remains to be seen, however, what value the distributors will pick for
the kernels they ship.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Reducing HZ from 1000 to 100 gives around 7% power saving. That could be significant on a laptop, but presumably 250 will save less. Perhaps a simpler way of saving power would be to use less bloated software ;)<br>

      Another reason to reduce the frequency is for servers with many virtual machines running since each one needs to service the interrupt and a machine with a thousand virtual machines running has to service ((1000 + 1) * Hz) timer interrupts.  That is excessive when most of the virtual machines might be idle.<br>

      There is another issue at work here which I have never taken the time to fully understand, but google tells me I am far from alone...<br>
<p>
1000Hz Kernels make my laptop sound card whine!<br>
<p>
100Hz whine far less if at all...<br>
<p>
I found this little gem a few years ago and various laptops I have had whine more or less with default kernels and changing this setting always seems to help.  <br>
<p>
It makes some "seat of the pants" sense that the frequency of interrupts when the system is "idle" could interact with a poorly isolated sound card and cause undesired analog results...  <br>
<p>
In the case of my current computer (dell 8600) it occurs:<br>
a. running under windows<br>
b. with the sound "muted" (under linux)<br>
<p>
The system whines when idle and quiets down when busy...<br>
<p>
I'd love to take the time to fully understand this some day, but in the mean time, I just change Hz and off I go computing quietly...<br>
<p>

      This is called a "singing capacitor".  It happens because the greed of OEMs drives them to use increasingly cheap components.  Windows uses a base timer frequency of 100HZ and that's all the OEMs test with so the problem isn't apparent under that OS.<br>

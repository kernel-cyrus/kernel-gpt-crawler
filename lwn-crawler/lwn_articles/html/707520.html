The 4.9-rc1 kernel prepatch, <a href="/Articles/703664/">released</a> on
October&nbsp;15, introduced a large set of new features — and, inevitably,
a smaller set of new regressions.  One of those problems, a module-related
bootstrap failure, remains unfixed in the mainline even after the <a
href="/Articles/707447/">4.9-rc7</a> release.  A fix to the problem
has been written and is known to work, but it may never be merged if, as
seems reasonably likely, the community chooses a simpler option.
<p>
<h4>The problem of module compatibility</h4>
<p>
Loading modules into the kernel is a tricky business.  Among other things,
the module must precisely match the kernel into which it is being loaded in
any of a number of ways.  If a function prototype differs between the
module and the kernel, bad things are sure to happen when that function is
called.  The same holds for data-structure layouts, configuration options,
and even the version of the compiler used to build the various pieces.  The
obvious way to be sure that everything matches is to build the kernel and
all loadable modules together; that is, indeed, how it is done most of the
time.  But there are users who want to be able to build the kernel and its
modules separately.
<p>
One obvious use case for separately built modules is code that is not in
the mainline, and, thus, cannot be built with the rest.  There are also
cases where users want to build and run a new kernel without necessarily
rebuilding the modules that they use.  Supporting these users while
trying to protect the kernel against the loading of incompatible modules
has led to the addition of a couple of layers of infrastructure.
<p>
The first of those is the "vermagic" string compiled into the kernel and
into every loadable module.  The system on which this article is being
written features the following vermagic string:
<p>
<pre>
    4.8.6-2-default SMP preempt mod_unload modversions
</pre>
<p>
In the simplest configuration, the module loader will simply check to
ensure that a module and the kernel have the exact same vermagic string.
That ensures that the module was built for the same kernel version and that
major options like SMP support were configured in the same way.  If the
test fails, the module will not be loaded.
<p>
That test, however, will thwart users who want to use the same binary
module in multiple versions of the kernel.  Even users who have a module
built for a distribution kernel will run into trouble when the distributor
ships an update; the version number will increment to something like
4.8.6-3 and the test will fail, even though the new kernel only adds a few
fixes and is almost certainly compatible with the old module.  Supporting
those users requires a more nuanced compatibility test.
<p>
The "modversions" configuration option is meant to be that test.  When
enabled, modversions changes both the compilation process and the module
loader.  When the kernel is built, a checksum is calculated from the
prototype of every exported function; those checksums are stored in a
special section of the binary.  When modules are built, those same
checksums are calculated for every exported function that the module calls; the
result is built into the module binary.  At module-load
time, the kernel will drop the first part of the vermagic string (the
kernel version number) before comparing it, meaning that modules can now be
loaded into 
versions other than the one they were built for.  But the loader will also
compare the checksums for all kernel symbols used by the module; should one
of those checksums fail to match, the module will not be loaded.  This test
will, thus, catch major changes in the functions used by modules, but it
still cannot catch more subtle changes.
<p>
<h4>Recent changes and modversions</h4>
<p>
Back in February, Al Viro posted <a href="/Articles/674303/">a set of
changes</a> to the symbol-export mechanism; these changes were designed to,
among 
other things, allow the placement of <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> directives in
assembly code for functions defined there.  These changes, merged into the
mainline for 4.9-rc1, improved symbol exports in a number of ways, but
there was one little problem: the generation of checksums for symbols
exported from assembly code does not work properly with
binutils&nbsp;2.27.  In particular, those checksums (which were set to zero
anyway) would be dropped entirely; the module loader would then complain
about the missing checksums and refuse to load the module.
As a result, systems with that version of binutils and with
modversions enabled will fail to boot if they require a module that uses
symbols defined in assembly code.
<p>
One <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4efca4ed05cbdfd13ec3e8cb623fb77d6e4ab187">fix</a>,
developed by Nick Piggin, is to create a special include file containing
prototypes for functions exported from assembly code; the build process can
read that file to generate the necessary modversions checksums.  That
ensures that the checksums are not only present, but also that they
correspond to the symbols and can be meaningfully checked.  This fix
was merged for 4.9-rc6, but it failed to actually fix the problem because
it did not finish the job.  Functions defined in assembly code are, by
their nature, architecture-specific, so the include file containing the
prototypes must be created for each architecture.  Those files were not
actually created for any architecture beyond PowerPC so, as of 4.9-rc7,
users of other architectures (i.e. most of us) can still run into the
problem. Adam Borowski has posted <a
href="/Articles/707526/">a patch</a> adding this file for the x86
architecture, but it has not been merged as of this writing.
<p>
And, indeed, it may never be merged, because it seems that most of the use
cases for modversions no longer exist.  Some distributors (notably Debian)
make use of it but, 
since they take pains to not change APIs in supported kernels, all they
really gain is the ability to avoid the kernel-version check (though Debian
also <a href="/Articles/707728/">counts on modversions</a> to allow
internal API
changes to be made without changing the kernel version).  As Linus
Torvalds <a 
href="/Articles/707527/">noted</a>, the feature was once useful for
developers who were tired of tracking down problems that were caused by
stale kernel modules.  In 2016, where the kernel version can contain the
actual Git revision that was built and where the time required to build a
full set of modules is short, modversions is no longer as useful as it
once was.  And, Piggin <a href="/Articles/707528/">noted</a>, modversions
uses a fair amount of complicated machinery for a mediocre result:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But still, modversions is pretty complicated for what it gives
	us. It sends preprocessed C into a C parser that makes CRCs using
	type definitions of exported symbols, then turns those CRCs into a
	linker script which which is used to link the .o file with. What we
	get in return is a quite limited symbol "versioning" system.
</div>
<p>
By "quite limited," he is referring to the fact that many changes will
elude the modversions check.  In particular, changes to a structure passed
to a function will not be caught.  Piggin suggested that a better result
could be obtained if the whole
mechanism were removed and replaced by a simple, manually maintained
version number attached to each exported symbol.  Whenever a developer made
an incompatible change, they would be expected to increment the version
number; modules 
using the affected interface would then fail to load until they were
rebuilt. 
<p>
The version-number suggestion did not get far; the chances of those numbers
actually being maintained in a useful manner are quite small.  But the idea
of removing modversions was better received.  Torvalds agreed that the
whole thing "<q>may just be too painful to bother with</q>" and that
the number of users is quite small — an idea reinforced by the fact that
few testers complained about this issue.  So, rather than apply the fix,
Torvalds chose instead to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cd3caefb4663e3811d37cc2afad3cce642d60061">mark
modversions as "broken"</a> (essentially disabling the feature altogether)
instead.  That change was merged just prior to the 4.9-rc7 release.
<p>
It seems, though, that not everybody is ready to see modversions go away
quite yet; in particular, Debian, which is planning on using 4.9 for the
upcoming "stretch" release, would like to have modversions available.  So,
after 4.9-rc7 was released, Torvalds committed <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/faaae2a581435f32781a105dda3501df388fddcb">another
change</a> re-enabling modversions, but with a change.  Rather than refuse
to load a module when a checksum is missing, the loader will log a
complaint and continue.  That should suffice to get modversions working
again on all systems without requiring the addition of
architecture-specific include files.  His real goal is clear, though:
"<q>Some day I really do want to remove MODVERSIONS entirely.  Sadly,
today does not appear to be that day.</q>"
<p>
When that day does come, Piggin has <a href="/Articles/707729/">a patch</a>
removing modversions altogether and replacing it with a simple option for
distributors to supply their own ABI version string to be used instead of
vermagic.  Getting rid of modversions removes about 7,700 lines of code
(much of which is generated by lex and bison) and simplifies the
module-loading logic.  It seems like a relatively easy sell — if
distributors agree that they can do without modversions in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

A number of the Enterprise distributions use modversions as part of kernel ABI. It would be extremely unfortunate to see this feature go away. I've asked a few folks to look into making the case to improve the code, rather than remove it.<br>

Oh, and technically, it gets far worse if you rely upon manually maintained ABI revisions. Now you have a situation in which - unless everyone is very careful to always remember to update the versioning whenever anything that depends upon a symbol changes (and that's not just the interface, that's any recursively using a structure referenced from a structure in the interface) - you can have modules that "load" and will crash the kernel. That's exactly the inverse of ideal. The reason for the complex CRC trickery is to ensure that - to a first approximation - nothing in the chain of dependencies in terms of structures used by a symbol has changed.<br>

The product I develop makes use of this feature.  It's particularly useful on Ubuntu which rolls new kernels frequently, but breaks compatibility (for our module) infrequently.<br>
<p>
We could try to get our code upstream, but the code is specific to our product and may not be of general interest.  We could use DKMS, but it seems brittle to require enterprise customers to have a functioning toolchain just to use our product.<br>
<p>
In the bad old days, Unix OS's like HP-UX would guarantee compatibility for kernel extensions across release families (e.g., minor releases).  This made it easier for application developers and (ultimately) enterprise customers.  I hope that folks keep enterprise customers in mind -- and not testers, as cited in the article -- when evaluating the utility of this feature.<br>

Ideally, those enterprise users would test recent kernels for regressions in features they depend on. When the relevant changes have trickled down to enterprise distribution kernels it's generally too late to do anything about it.<br>

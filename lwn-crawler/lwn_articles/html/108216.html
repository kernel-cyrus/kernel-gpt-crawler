The efforts to bring hard realtime response to Linux continue.  For those
of you following along at home, here is a summary of the latest
realtime Linux developments. 
<p>

Ingo Molnar continues to crank out patches at a high rate.  The latest, 
<strike><a href="/Articles/108008/">-RT-2.6.9-mm1-V0</a></strike> <a
href="/Articles/108449/">-RT-2.6.9-mm1-V0.3</a>, is advertised as being 
rather more experimental than its predecessors - which is saying
something.  This patch set brings preemptible mutexes to (almost) the last,
most difficult parts of the kernel, including the low-level memory
allocators, wait queue code, kernel timers, and more.  Says Ingo:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	this is probably the last 'big leap forward' in terms of the scope
	of the patch. (having reached the ultimate scope: it now
	encompasses everything ;)
</div>
<p>

Some small pieces of this work have been put forward as independent
patches; these include the enhancements to the completion interface
mentioned <a href="/Articles/106560/">last week</a>.  Linus has also made a
couple of changes to the big kernel lock code in support of this sort of
work: the BKL functions are now entirely out-of-line, and some of the code
for managing the BKL itself has been made preemptible.
<p>

Ingo's patch also changes a number of semaphores in the kernel over to
completions.  For situations where one kernel thread needs to notify
another that some task has been finished, completions are a better
interface: they make the intent of the code clear, and they are better
optimized for that use.  Some of those patches have been posted separately
as well, leading to some pushback from kernel developers who believe that
their use of semaphores for that purpose is entirely legitimate.  Bill
Huey, the developer behind the mmlinux realtime project, is the person who
has been pushing some of those patches; he <a
href="/Articles/108221/">responded</a> to the resistance in this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Well, this is something that's got to be considered by the larger
	Linux community and whether these conventions are to be kept or
	removed. It's a larger issue than what can be address in Ingo's
	preemption patch, but with inevitable need for something like this
	in the kernel (hard RT) it's really unavoidable collision. IMO,
	it's got to go, which is a nasty change.
</div>
<p>

This, of course, is just the sort of talk which will put many kernel
developers off the realtime patches entirely; some of Mr. Huey's subsequent
postings, being rather more inflammatory, did not help the situation
either.  Ingo <a href="/Articles/108223/">went into damage control mode</a>
and smoothed things over, for now.  If and when the realtime preemption
patch is put forward for inclusion, however, chances are that the
discussion could get heated indeed.
<p>

Paul McKenney, meanwhile, <a href="/Articles/107930/">expressed a
discomfort</a> with the realtime work which must certainly be
felt by many:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The problem is that the entire OS kernel must be modified to ensure
	that all code paths are deterministic.  It would be much better if
	there was an evolutionary path to hard realtime.
</div>
<p>

His message included a patch intended to point toward such a path.  This
patch, which assumes an SMP system, works by setting aside one CPU as a
purely realtime processor; it is not part of the regular scheduling
mechanism.  Realtime processes may be assigned to that CPU by the system
administrator.  If they mostly work in user mode, all is well; they have a
dedicated processor and need not worry about latency.  As soon as a
realtime process invokes a system call, however, it goes into
non-deterministic mode and is booted out to one of the system's other
processors.  In this way, the dedicated, real-time processor never gets
stuck waiting for a lock.
<p>

The downside, of course, is that, every now and then, it is actually nice
to be able to use system calls.  Paul's idea was that each Linux system
call could be examined individually, and, if warranted, modified to be
entirely preemptible.  When any particular system call reaches a state
where it is considered to be deterministic, it could be added to a list of
such calls, and realtime processes using it need not be shifted away from
the realtime processor.  Over time, this list would grow to the point that
realtime tasks which do actual, interesting work could be run on the
mainline Linux kernel.  In the mean time, there would be no need for a
major flag day where the entire kernel locking scheme is changed at once.
<p>

The real challenge with this approach would be to make I/O deterministic,
since realtime processes usually must act in response to external events.
That cannot be done until it is clear that all filesystems and device
drivers have been made entirely preemptible - and, at that point, much of
the system has been affected.  Meanwhile, it turns out that the 2.6.9
kernel already has part of this mechanism: the new <tt>isolcpus=</tt> boot
parameter excludes one or more processors from regular scheduling.  The
scheme for migrating realtime processes when they invoke a
non-deterministic system call is not present, however.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm sure next time the editors are <i> summarizing </i> kernel hacker activities they'll be more careful. I also think LWN does a little bit more than summarize what was written on LKML.

<p>It does, but that's not relevant to this point, because the summarizing
alone is hard work and worthy of appreciation.

      <a href = "http://www.ccur.com/isd_solutions_redhawklinux.asp?o9=1">Red Hawk Linux</a> has used <i>processor shielding</i> for some time now as part of its approach to real-time capability.
<p>
Does anyone know if this is similar to the current (2.6.9) mechanism for
isolating cpus from regular scheduling?

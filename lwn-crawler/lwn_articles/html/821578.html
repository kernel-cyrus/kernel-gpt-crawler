<p>The Linux deadline scheduler supports realtime systems where
applications need to
be sure of getting their work done within a specific period of time.  It
allocates CPU time to deadline tasks in such a way as to ensure that each
task's specific timing constraints are met.
However, the current
implementation does not work well on asymmetric CPU configurations like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE">Arm's
big.LITTLE</a>. Dietmar Eggemann recently <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200520134243.19352-1-dietmar.eggemann@arm.com/">posted
a patch set</a> to address this problem by adding the notion of CPU
capacity to the deadline scheduler.</p>

<p>In realtime systems, tasks
need to meet certain timing requirements.
The Linux kernel 
includes two realtime scheduling classes to meet the needs of these
systems:  POSIX realtime (often 
called just "realtime") and deadline.</p>

<p>The POSIX realtime scheduler uses task priorities as the basis of its
decisions; the task with the highest priority will be run first.
The deadline scheduler, instead, dispenses with priorities and describes
tasks using three 
parameters: the run time, period, and deadline. The run time is the CPU
time that the task 
requires to finish its immediate work, the period defines the time between
two activations 
of the task, and the deadline is the time by which the task must be able to
use its CPU time. Interested readers can find more
explanation of the theory behind the Linux realtime schedulers and the
differences between them in <a href="/Articles/743740/">an earlier
article</a>.</p> 

<h4>The deadline scheduler and asymmetric CPU configurations</h4>

<p>The deadline scheduler includes an admission algorithm that
runs when a task requests deadline scheduling and ensures that the system
will be able to meet the task's needs.
A task will be refused entry into the deadline class if the realtime guarantees
cannot be met and any task in the system would miss
its deadlines. However, the algorithm does not guarantee the
deadlines will always be met, it only guarantees bounded tardiness for
the deadline tasks and non-starvation for non-deadline ones. This is
because the ability to meet deadlines in the general case depends on the tasks
already in the system; a detailed explanation is available in <a
href="/Articles/743946/">this article</a>.</p>  

<p>The work of the deadline scheduler becomes more complicated in
asymmetric CPU configurations, like big.LITTLE or <a
href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/dynamiq">DynamIQ</a>. Such 
systems include different types of CPUs, with higher and lower
performance. The same task running on a higher-performance ("big") CPU
will take less time than when
run on a lower-performance ("little") one. The deadline
scheduler in current kernels does not take that difference into account,
with the result that it can
over-allocate the CPU time on lower-performance CPUs.  Deadline tasks could
end up on a little CPU, scheduled in such a way that they
are unable to finish before their deadlines, while they would be able
to do so on a higher-performance CPU.  On such systems, the
admission-control algorithm, which assumes that all CPUs perform at the
level of the big 
ones, could overcommit the system with deadline tasks, making the system
unusable.

</p>

<p>The information missing in the deadline scheduler is an understanding
of CPU capacity — the number of
instructions that can be executed in a given time. More details of how
it is calculated can be found in <a
href="/Articles/639543/">this article</a>.  The CPU  
capacity is already used in load balancing and in other situations,
for example when changing CPU frequency <a
href="/Articles/788380/">because of overheating</a>,  
and it has recently been <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/804d402fb6f6">added to the realtime
scheduler</a>. Eggemann's work takes 
capacity into account in the deadline scheduler's  admission-control and
task-placement
algorithms. After the changes, the deadline scheduler places the tasks
in such a way that the available capacity is sufficient to
allow tasks to meet their deadlines in both symmetric and asymmetric
CPU configurations.</p>

<h4>The changes</h4>

<p>
The admission-control algorithm bases its decisions on the total CPU
capacity provided by the system.
In symmetric systems, where all CPUs have the same
capacity, the sum is the simply the number of
CPUs multiplied by a constant.  Current kernels calculate total capacity
this way even on asymmetric systems; all CPUs are assumed to have the
capacity of the largest ones.  The new code changes this metric
in the asymmetric case, causing it to calculate the
sum of the actual capacities of all active CPUs.</p>

<p>
The deadline scheduler's task-placement code also must gain a better
understanding of the system's CPU topology.  Before moving a task to a new
CPU, the scheduler needs to ensure that the new CPU can handle that task.
In asymmetric systems, a new type of a check is needed to find out if the
CPU's capacity is sufficient to perform a given task's work before its
deadline. This fitness check is performed using the 
following formula:</p>

<pre>
    (CPU capacity) / 1024 &gt;= (task runtime) / (task deadline)
</pre>

<p>The default CPU capacity is 1024; lower-performance CPUs have a
capacity lower than that.  The left-hand side of this formula thus
yields a fraction indicating the relative capacity of the CPU in question. 
For example, assume the capacity of a small CPU is 462,
then that fraction is 462/1024, or&nbsp;0.45. The formula
will admit only tasks that have ratio of run time (which is relative to a
big CPU) to deadline of less
or equal to 0.45. A task with a runtime of 13,000µs and deadline of
16,000µs will not be admitted, as 13,000/16,000 is&nbsp;0.81, which is a
larger value.</p>

<p>This check is used when waking up a deadline task, moving a deadline
task to a 
different CPU, and migrating a task
out of a CPU that is going offline. Eggemann <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/b72f72c1-6043-c44f-31f5-fb4137bd5d52@arm.com/">showed
some example capacity calculations</a> during the discussion of an earlier
version of the patch set.</p>

<p>If a task cannot be served according to its deadline, it
will miss that deadline. This can always happen with the deadline scheduler,
for example, in a situation when the task was admitted successfully,
but then one of the CPUs went offline and the overall capacity of the
system was reduced. <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200427083709.30262-7-dietmar.eggemann@arm.com/">This
change</a>,  introduced in the patch set, is how this situation will be
handled in an asymmetric configuration; the scheduler will choose the CPU
with the maximum available capacity. If there are 
several of them, it prefers the current CPU, if possible, to make use of any
remaining cache contents.

<h4>Limitations and further work</h4>

<p>The work on asymmetric CPU support in the deadline scheduler does
not end here. The current patch set only supports the case when there
is at least one CPU without any deadline tasks; otherwise task placement
may still be incorrect. The case of more
heavily loaded systems will need to be addressed later.</p>

<p>During the discussion, Juri Lelli <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200427133438.GA6469@localhost.localdomain/">pointed
out</a> a possible problem: if a set of small deadline tasks starts first,
they will be placed on large CPUs.  If a 
bigger task is then admitted, it may not find a CPU large enough to run
on.  Luca Abeni (co-author of the patch set) <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200427161715.3dd3a148@nowhere/">responded</a>
that they do have an updated patch where the scheduler places tasks on
the smallest CPU that can get the work done.  This patch will be
submitted later.</p>

<p>The patch set has received positive reviews, and we should expect that
this fix will become part of the mainline kernel soon. We can also
expect to see more patches in this area as there is more work to
do; with more asymmetric CPU architectures popping up, users
may require better support of such configurations in their
workloads.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

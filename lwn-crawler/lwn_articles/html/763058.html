<p>
Side-channel attacks are a reasonably well-known technique to exfiltrate
information across security boundaries.  Until relatively recently,
concerns about these types of attacks were mostly confined to cryptographic
operations, where the target was to extract secrets by observing some side
channel. But with the advent of Spectre, speculative execution provides a
new way to exploit side channels.  A new Linux Security
Module (LSM) 
is meant to help determine where a side channel
might provide secrets to an attacker, so that a
speculative-execution barrier operation can be performed.
</p>

<p>
In current kernels, a context switch from one process to another
often necessitates a flush of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) contents,
which is done in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.3/source/arch/x86/mm/tlb.c#L183"><tt>switch_mm_irqs_off()</tt></a>.
For x86, after the Spectre&nbsp;v2 mitigations, that function calls <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.3/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h#L263"><tt>indirect_branch_prediction_barrier()</tt></a>
when switching away from a process that is not allowed to core dump
(i.e. does not have <tt>SUID_DUMP_USER</tt> set).  The barrier (which is
known as IBPB) is an expensive operation, so it is only done for
"sensitive" processes that have turned off core dumps (e.g. GPG).  Core
dumps of a process can contain secrets of various sorts, such as keys or
passwords. 
</p>

<p>
However, there may be other sensitive processes that do not turn off core
dumps
but are still susceptible to this side channel,
so a <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/20180815235355.14908-1-casey.schaufler@intel.com/">patch
set</a> from Casey Schaufler would allow LSMs to offer an opinion on
whether the IBPB should be done.  It adds a new LSM hook
(<tt>task_safe_sidechannel()</tt>) that will return zero if there are no
known side-channel worries or <tt>-EACCES</tt> if the LSM considers the
context switch to be potentially sensitive.  The patch set provides an
LSM to 
check some security attributes of tasks and also adds checking to the
SELinux and Smack LSMs so that they can report whether the security
attributes they maintain indicate a potential side-channel concern.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/20180815235355.14908-6-casey.schaufler@intel.com/">SELinux</a>
and <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/20180815235355.14908-5-casey.schaufler@intel.com/">Smack</a>
changes add an entry for the new hook.  Each looks at
the current task and the task to be switched to and renders a verdict on
the side-channel safety of the switch.  The SELinux hook considers the
switch to be safe against side channels if the current task has
<tt>FILE__READ</tt> access to the new task.  For Smack, it is similar:
"<q>Smack considers its private task data safe if the current task 
has read access to the passed task.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
The bulk of the patch set, though, is the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/20180815235355.14908-4-casey.schaufler@intel.com/">new
"sidechannel" LSM</a>.  It is 
enabled with the <tt>SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL</tt> kernel configuration option, but
requires  
other options in order to actually do any checking.  One of them assumes
that all task switches are subject to side channels
(<tt>SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_ALWAYS</tt>), so it simply always returns
<tt>-EACCES</tt>.  The other three enable various checks:
<ul class="spacylist">
<li><tt>SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_UIDS</tt>: checks if the tasks have different
effective UIDs and reports side-channel susceptibility if so; this could
have a high performance impact since most context switches are between
tasks with different effective UIDs.
<li><tt>SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_CAPABILITIES</tt>:  checks if the tasks have
different sets of capabilities, which may mean the new task would be
subject to side-channel attacks.
<li><tt>SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_NAMESPACES</tt>: checks if the tasks live in
different user, PID, or control-group namespaces and returns
<tt>-EACCES</tt> if so.
</ul>
Given that a distribution will have to enable the LSM to make it available
to its users, it would seem to some kind of runtime or load-time
configuration of the different levels might be useful.  As it stands, the
LSM looks like it will only be used by those who build their own kernels.
</p>

<p>
The comments on the patch set have been relatively light.  Jann Horn has
made several suggestions, most of which Schaufler has adopted; the patch
set is now up to <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/20180821000444.7004-1-casey.schaufler@intel.com/">v3</a>.  One comment that has not been addressed in the
patch set is Horn's <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/CAG48ez0=RSok9mAo9QHsho+Qnm_ZDqkH68Amfzj9A_jWmOZaOA@mail.gmail.com/">request</a>
that the security checks look at the previous non-kernel task when
switching away from the kernel.  He <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/CAG48ez1LHOHvB4ud+8asOjKARVLQJGV4ocdKVDJtvTXTfeMa9w@mail.gmail.com/">went
into more detail</a> in a posting on v2 of the patch set:
<div class="BigQuote">
That means that an attacker who can e.g. get a CPU to first switch
from an attacker task to a softirqd (e.g. for network packet
processing or whatever), then switch from the softirqd to a root-owned
victim task would be able to bypass the check, right? That doesn't
sound like a very complicated attack...
<p>
I very much dislike the idea of adding a mitigation with a known
bypass technique to the kernel.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The test in <tt>switch_mm_irqs_off()</tt> to decide whether to do the IBPB
looks at the task structure; if it is a kernel thread, thus
does not have an <tt>mm</tt> pointer to a process address space, the
rest of the checks are shorted out.  Schaufler didn't change that,
though he did "touch" it by adding the new LSM hook call, so Horn's
complaint is really about the existing test.  Horn suggested keeping a copy
of the metadata for the most recent non-kernel task in order to do that
test, but Schaufler has not made that change; his <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/99FC4B6EFCEFD44486C35F4C281DC6732143F769@ORSMSX107.amr.corp.intel.com/">argument</a>
was that those who are concerned about that kind of attack should probably
simply enable the "always" option.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler was also concerned with finding a good mechanism to save the task
metadata.  Horn <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/kernel-hardening/CAG48ez0j4+4iaH60Xf857Oh8TwhXzA39M3-CC4kXJKf6Ctvchg@mail.gmail.com/">offered
some suggestions</a>, but noted that the obvious way to do so might not be
favored in a hot path like context switching:
"<q>The obvious solution would be to take a refcounted reference on the
old task's objective creds, but you probably want to avoid the
resulting cache line bouncing...</q>"
</p>

<p>
It certainly seems reasonable for the LSMs to get involved in the decision
on whether a process might be susceptible to a side-channel attack from
another process.  The current "dumpable" test is a simple one, but likely
ignores many sensitive processes.  But context switching is an important
function of the kernel and one that should be done as quickly as possible.
Adding complexity there may not be particularly welcome, but there have
been no complaints so far.  Speculative execution is done as a performance
optimization but clearly we are having to give some of that improvement
back to work around the shortcomings of its implementation in some CPUs.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are many kinds of side-channel, not just those using caches to extract uarch state through mistraining of a branch predictor to steer speculation. It would make sense to confine this if it's about IBPB to what it is trying to address, rather than any implied "all side-channels".<br>

Actually it makes sense to use the general name. Of course, nobody should assume that this magically protects against all (even yet unknown) side channels. But if mitigations against other side channels are added to the kernel, they probably should be hooked to the same LSM. It would be a configuration hell to configure each individual mitigation for each process. Having one knob identifying critical processes (or process pairs when considering information flow) that will trigger all mitigations is preferable to me.<br>

But we don't know what will be the side channels discovered, or made practically exploitable, at some point in the future.  The cost of mitigating them may be higher, or they may only affect certain types of programs (for example, a side channel based on disk I/O would be unlikely to attack a cryptography library).  It would make more sense to add the specific configuration for this particular case, and then add others as and when they arise.  Once several such cases exist, and it is observed they tend to follow a common pattern, it can be generalized.<br>

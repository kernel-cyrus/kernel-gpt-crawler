           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 7, 2023</br>

<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">Return-oriented
programming (ROP)</a> has, for some years now, been a valuable tool for
those who would subvert a system's security.  It is thus not surprising
that a lot of effort has gone into thwarting ROP attacks, which depend on
corrupting the call stack with a carefully chosen set of return addresses,
at both the hardware and software levels.  One result of this work is
shadow stacks, which can detect corruption of the call stack, allowing the
operating system to react accordingly.  The 64-bit Arm implementation of
shadow stacks is called "guarded control stack" (GCS); patches implementing
support for this feature are currently under discussion.
<p>
A shadow stack is a copy of a thread's call stack; it is often (but not
necessarily) maintained by the CPU hardware.  Whenever a function call is
made, the current return address is pushed onto both the regular stack and
the shadow stack.  When the function returns, the addresses at the top of
the two stacks are compared; if they do not match, the system concludes
that the call stack has been corrupted and, probably, aborts execution.
This check is enough to defeat most attacks that involve writing a sequence
of return addresses to the stack.  Even if the shadow stack is writable,
the need to update it to match the call stack raises the bar for a
successful exploit considerably.

<p>
Software shadow stacks can be effective, but there are advantages to
implementing them in hardware; the performance can be better, and the CPU
can prevent attempts to corrupt the shadow stack.  Naturally, any such
support will be architecture-specific, and so will require
architecture-specific code to make use of.  The effort to implement <a
href="/Articles/926649/">user-space shadow stacks for x86</a> has been
underway for some time and will, with luck, land in the mainline in the
near future.
<p>
The 64-bit Arm ("aarch64") processors — and the developers adding support
for the new processor features — are coming later to the shadow-stack
party, a fact that brings both advantages and disadvantages.  On the
"advantage" side, the x86 developers have spent years in extended
discussions over how shadow stacks should be supported and what the
interface to them should look like, and they have the scars to show for it.
In the cover letter for the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230716-arm64-gcs-v1-0-bf567f93bba6@kernel.org/">GCS
support patch series</a>, Mark Brown made it clear that he intends to avoid
a similar experience if possible:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	As there has been extensive discussion with the wider community
	around the ABI for shadow stacks I have as far as practical kept
	implementation decisions close to those for x86, anticipating that
	review would lead to similar conclusions in the absence of strong
	reasoning for divergence.
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, the first implementer of a kernel feature is not
normally expected to make that implementation sufficiently general for the
needs of those that will follow.  Experience has shown that premature
abstraction, like premature optimization, tends not to lead to good
results.  So it is often the second or third comer who has to create a
framework that all implementations can fit into.
<p>
<h4>The Arm shadow-stack interface</h4>
<p>
In this case, there was relatively little work of this type to do.  The Arm
world doesn't use the term "shadow stack" much, preferring the GCS term,
but x86 got there first, so "shadow stack" has become the
generic way of referring to this feature.  The x86 implementation adds some
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/arch_prctl.2.html"><tt>arch_prctl()</tt></a>
calls to control the feature, but aarch64 does not implement
<tt>arch_prctl()</tt> at all.  So, instead, the GCS patches create a new
set of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
calls meant to control the feature on all architectures.  The main control
operation is <tt>PR_SET_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS</tt>, which takes a number of
flags. 
<p>
Whenever a new thread is created, it will not have a shadow stack.  One can
be added using <tt>PR_SET_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS</tt> with the
<tt>PR_SHADOW_STACK_ENABLE</tt> flag; that will cause a shadow stack to be
allocated, and the calling thread will start using it.  Since this call
initializes the shadow stack, the portion of the call stack that was
populated prior to the function that turned on the shadow stack will not be
represented there; as a result, returning from that function will not be
possible.  Since the expectation is that the shadow stack will be enabled
in the dynamic loader before jumping to a program's entry point, this
limitation should not normally be a problem.
<p>
Invoking <tt>PR_SET_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS</tt> <i>without</i>
<tt>PR_SHADOW_STACK_ENABLE</tt> set will disable the shadow stack.  On the
Arm architecture, the setup of a shadow stack can only be done once for any
given thread; if the shadow stack is subsequently disabled, it is gone
forever.
<p>
Shadow-stack memory is specially marked and can be protected from
manipulation by the owning process.  There is a pair of flags that controls
whether user space can make changes to the shadow stack (outside of those
that happen automatically at function-call and return time).  The
<tt>PR_SHADOW_STACK_PUSH</tt> flag allows user space to push entries onto
the stack using a special instruction, while <tt>PR_SHADOW_STACK_WRITE</tt>
enables ordinary writes.  Either or both of these capabilities may be
needed to, for example, support user-space threading; enabling them reduces
the security provided by the shadow stack, but the core defense against
stack-smashing attacks (including ROP attacks) remains.
<p>
As with x86, shadow stacks are normally allocated automatically by the
kernel.  In cases where user space may need to allocate shadow stacks
separately (again, user-space threading comes to mind), the
<tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt> system call is supported:
<p>
<pre>
    void *map_shadow_stack(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The returned pointer, on success, indicates a range of memory that has been
properly prepared for shadow-stack use, with the protections set
appropriately and the necessary tokens (which allow the CPU to recognize
the stack and prevent concurrent use) put in place.  Actually switching to
the allocated stack requires using a dedicated Arm instruction.
<p>
The <tt>PR_LOCK_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS</tt> flag locks the indicated
configuration in place, preventing future changes.  This flag can be used
to prevent the thread from disabling the shadow stack or enabling writes to
it.  There is also a separate <tt>PR_GET_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS</tt> operation
that can be used to query the current status.
<p>
This patch set only implements shadow-stack support for user space; there
is no support for kernel-space shadow stacks.
<p>
<h4>Prospects</h4>
<p>
This work appears to be
relatively uncontroversial and to be nearly ready to go, with one caveat:
it depends on the x86 shadow-stack work in a number of ways.  The x86
patches also seem nearly ready, but they were <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wiuVXTfgapmjYQvrEDzn3naF2oYnHuky+feEJSj_G_yFQ@mail.gmail.com/">turned
down</a> by Linus Torvalds during the 6.4 merge window, and were not
proposed for 6.5.  Until the x86 work lands in the mainline, the Arm
patches will not be able do to so.  As a result, the 6.7 release seems like
the earliest that can be expected to include Arm shadow-stack support.
<p>
It is also worth mentioning that shadow stacks are also coming to RISC-V,
with the feature bearing the intuitive name "zisslpcfi".  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230213045351.3945824-1-debug@rivosinc.com/">support
patches</a> are still "<q>RFC quality</q>" and will likely need some work.
They contain the generic <tt>prctl()</tt> operations (indeed, the first
version of that interface appeared there), but do not include
<tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt>, preferring an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
interface that has been deemed unsuitable elsewhere.  The zisslpcfi patches
also include support for forward-edge control-flow integrity, similar to
the x86 <a href="/Articles/889475/">indirect branch tracking</a>.
<p>
Hardware-based protection for control-flow integrity is clearly seen by all
of the vendors as an important part of their security strategy, with most
processors of interest adding support.  Updating the kernel to actually use
these features has been a slow process, with a number of roadblocks
appearing along the way.  The indications are, though, that this multi-year
journey is reaching its end and attackers will have to move on to new
techniques in the ongoing security arms race.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In case you're wondering why the RISC-V extensions will be called "Zicfiss" and "Zicfilp", here is why:<br>
<p>
RISC-V extensions were originally single letters, like "I" for ISA base, "A" for Atomic and so on. Which worked well until predictably they ran out of letters.  The new convention is Z + most closely related extension + name.<br>
<p>
So Zicfiss is Z + i (closely related to normal baseline instructions) + name "cfiss" for control flow integrity shadow stack.  Zicfilp is the same but "landing pad".<br>
<p>
Is "zisslpcfi" from the article an earlier version of the extension name?  The latest extension docs don't seem to refer to it: <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/blob/main/riscv-cfi.pdf">https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/blob/main/riscv-cfi.pdf</a><br>

      [no-ROP is a ban on Return-Oriented Programming]
<pre>&gt; Whenever a function call is made, the current return address is pushed onto both
&gt; the regular stack and the shadow stack. When the function returns, the addresses at the top
&gt; of the two stacks are compared; if they do not match, the system concludes that the call stack
&gt; has been corrupted and, probably, aborts execution.</pre>
<p>
If that is enforced strictly, then it breaks the user-mode ABI.  I anticipate the crashing of hundreds of apps with thousands of installations.  I wrote those apps.  More precisely, I wrote the ELF side of <a href="https://upx.github.io/">UPX</a>. which compresses an ELF module (main program or shared library) into smaller space (typically 30% to 60% less) but retains the same external behavior.  The self-contained execution stub which quickly expands the compressed module into RAM, back to its original layout, uses ROP in places because ROP is smaller than any other method.  Cache misses from any hardware return-address [prediction] cache are ignored in favor of fewer bytes of code and less complexity.
<p>
On x86*, if the observable semantic behavior of a CALL instruction is anything other than <tt>{*--sp = next_ip; goto target;}</tt>, or a RET(URN) instruction is anything other than <tt>{goto *sp++;}</tt>, then that breaks the architectural ABI of the CPU.  If you want something more, then you should get a different opcode.
<p>
In general, ROP can be a valuable technique for implementing a generator, emulator, or interpreter, especially in small space.  ROP is a hardware implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code">direct threaded code</a>.  At first, storage space in many current systems may appear to be effectively infinite; yet complaints such as “another song/photo/video/app/backup won’t fit” seem never to disappear.

The expectation is that as with BTI the dynamic loader will look at ELF markings to determine if the binaries it is linking support GCS, and there will probably be an override mechanism with something like environment variables too. In any case it's entirely in userspace.<br>

<h1>Some block layer patches</h1>

Lest LWN readers think that all of the development activity is currently
centered around memory management issues, it is worth pointing out that
some significant patches to the block subsystem are circulating as well.
Here is a quick summary.
<p>

Linux I/O schedulers are charged with presenting I/O requests to block
devices in an optimal order.  There are currently four schedulers in the
kernel, each with a different notion of "optimal."  All of them, however,
maintain a "dispatch queue," being the list of requests which have been
selected for submission to the device.  Each scheduler currently maintains
its own dispatch queue.
<p>
Tejun Heo has decided that the proliferation of dispatch queues is a
wasteful duplication of code, so he has implemented a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/156273/">generic dispatch queue</a> to bring
things back together.  The unification of the dispatch queues helps to
ensure that all I/O schedulers implement queues with the same semantics.
It also simplifies the schedulers by freeing them of the need to deal with
non-filesystem requests.  In general, the developers have been heard to
say, recently, that the block subsystem is not really about block devices;
it is, instead, a generic message queueing mechanism.  The generic dispatch
queue code helps to take things in that direction.
<p>

Tejun Heo has also <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/156274/">reimplemented
the I/O barrier code</a>.  The result should be much improved barrier
handling, but it also involves some API changes visible to block drivers.
The new code recognizes that different devices will support barriers in
different ways.  There are three variables which are taken into account:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Whether the device supports ordered tags or not.  Ordered tags allows 
     there to be multiple outstanding requests, with the device expected to
     handle them in the indicated order.  In the absence of ordered tags,
     barriers can only be implemented by stopping the request queue and
     being sure that requests before the barrier complete before any
     subsequent requests are issued.
<p>
<li> Whether an explicit flush operation is required prior to issuing the
     barrier operation.  Devices which perform write caching usually will
     need to be flushed for the barrier semantics to be met.
<p>
<li> Whether the device supports the "forced unit access" (FUA) mode.  If
     FUA is supported, the actual barrier request can be issued in FUA
     mode, and there is no need to force a flush afterward.  In the absence
     of FUA, flushes are usually required before and after the barrier
     operation.
</ul>
<p>

A block driver will tell the system about how its device operates with
<tt>blk_queue_ordered()</tt>, which has a new prototype:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef void (prepare_flush_fn)(request_queue_t *q, 
                                    struct request *rq);
    int blk_queue_ordered(request_queue_t *q, unsigned ordered,
		          prepare_flush_fn *prepare_flush_fn,
		          unsigned gfp_mask);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>ordered</tt> parameter describes how barriers to be implemented; it
has values like <tt>QUEUE_ORDERED_DRAIN_FLUSH</tt> to indicate that
barriers are implemented by stopping the queue, and that flushes are
required both before and after the barrier; or <tt>QUEUE_ORDERED_TAG</tt>,
which says that ordered tags handle everything.  The
<tt>prepare_flush_fn()</tt> will be called to do whatever is required to
make a specific operation force a flush to physical media.  See <a
href="/Articles/157209/">Tejun's documentation patch</a> for more details.
<p>
With the above information in hand, the block layer can handle the
implementation of barrier requests.  As long as the driver implements
flushes when requested and recognizes I/O requests requiring the FUA mode
(a helper function <tt>blk_fua_rq()</tt> is provided for this purpose), the
rest is taken care of at the higher levels.
<p>
The barrier patch also adds an <tt>uptodate</tt> parameter to
<tt>end_that_request_last()</tt>.  This API change, which will affect most
block drivers, is necessary to enable drivers to signal errors for
non-filesystem requests.
<p>
The conversation on the lists suggests that both of the above patches are
headed for the mainline sooner or later.  Mike Christie's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/156058/">block layer multipath patch</a>
may take
a little longer, however.  The question of where multipath support should
be implemented has often been discussed; more recently, the seeming
consensus was that the device mapper layer was the right place.  The result
was that the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/124703/">device mapper
multipath patches</a> were merged early this year.  So it is a bit
surprising to see the issue come back now.
<p>

Mike has a few reasons for wanting to implement multipath at the lower
level.  These include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Dealing with multipath hardware involves a number of strange SCSI
     commands, and, especially, error codes.  With the current
     implementation, it is hard to get detailed error information up to the
     device mapper layers in any sort of generic way.
<p>

<li> Lower-level multipath makes it easier to merge device commands (such
     as failover requests) with the regular I/O stream.
<p>

<li> The request queue mechanism is a better place for
     handling retries and other related tasks.  
<p>
<li> Placing the I/O scheduler above
     the multipath mechanism allows scheduling decisions to be made at the right
     time.  
<p>
<li> In theory, a wider
     range of devices could benefit from the multipath implementation - should
     anybody have a need for a multipath tape drive.
</ul>

<p>
A number of code simplifications are also said to result from the new
organization. 
The new multipath code is essentially a repackaging of the device mapper
code, reworked to deal with the block layer from underneath.  It not being
proposed for merging at this time, or even for serious review.  So far,
there has been little discussion of this patch.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It looks like the 2.6.15 flood has already opened; and the generic dispatch queue is already in there.  Nearly 2 years after 2.6 came out, the pace is still pretty extraordinary.<br>

<p>
Did you expect the pace to slow?

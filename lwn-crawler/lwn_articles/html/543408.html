<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 20, 2013</br>
           </div>
Almost any I/O device worth its electrons will support direct memory access
(DMA) transactions; to do otherwise is to be relegated to the world of
low-bandwidth, high-overhead I/O.  But "DMA-capable" devices are not all
equally so; many of them have limitations restricting the range of memory
that can be directly accessed.  The 24-bit limitation that afflicted ISA
devices in the early days of the personal computer is a classic example,
but contemporary hardware also has its limits.  The kernel has long had a
mechanism for working around these limitations, but it turns out that this
subsystem has some interesting problems of its own.
<p>
DMA limitations are usually a result of a device having fewer address lines
than would be truly useful.  The 24 lines described by the ISA
specification are an obvious example; there is simply no way for an
ISA-compliant device to address more than 16MB of physical memory.  PCI
devices are normally limited to a 32-bit address space, but a number of
devices are limited to a smaller space as a result of dubious hardware
design; as is so often the case, 
hardware designers have shown a great deal of creativity in this area.  But
users are not concerned with these issues; they just want their peripherals
to work.  So the kernel has to find a way to respect any given device's
special limits while still using DMA to the greatest extent possible.
<p>
The kernel's DMA API (described in <a
href="/Articles/543419/">Documentation/DMA-API.txt</a>) abstracts and hides
most of the details of making DMA actually work with any specific device.
This API will, for example, endeavor to allocate memory that falls within
the physical range supported by the target device.  It will also
transparently implement "bounce buffering" — copying data between a
device-inaccessible buffer and an accessible buffer — if necessary.  To do
so, however, the DMA API must be informed of a device's addressing limits.
That is done through the provision of a "DMA mask," a bitmask describing
the memory range reachable by the device.  The documentation describes the
mask this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The dma_mask represents a bit mask of the addressable region for
	the device.  I.e., if the physical address of the memory anded with
	the dma_mask is still equal to the physical address, then the
	device can perform DMA to the memory.
</div>
<p>
The problem, as recently <a href="/Articles/543424/">pointed out</a> by
Russell King, is that the DMA mask is not always interpreted that way.  He
points to code like the following, found in <tt>block/blk-settings.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    void blk_queue_bounce_limit(struct request_queue *q, u64 dma_mask)
    {
	unsigned long b_pfn = dma_mask &gt;&gt; PAGE_SHIFT;
</pre>
<p>
What is happening here is that the code is right-shifting the DMA mask to
turn it into a "page frame number" (PFN).  If one envisions a system's
memory as a linear array of pages, the PFN of a given page is simply its
index into that array (though memory is not always organized so simply).
By treating a DMA mask as, for all practical purposes, another way of
expressing the PFN of the highest addressable page, the block code is
changing the semantics of how the mask is interpreted.
<p>
Russell explained how that can be problematic.  On some ARM systems,
memory does not start at a physical address of zero; the physical
address of the first byte can be as high as 3GB (<tt>0xc0000000</tt>).  If a
system configured in this way has a device with a 26-bit address limitation
(with the upper bits 
being filled in by the bus hardware), then its DMA mask should be set to
<tt>0xc3ffffff</tt>.  Any physical address within the device's range will be
unchanged by a logical AND operation with this mask, while any address
outside of that range will not.
<p>
But what then happens when the block code right-shifts that mask to get a
PFN from the mask?  The result (assuming 4096-byte pages) is <tt>0xc3fff</tt>, which
is a perfectly valid PFN on a system where the PFN of the first page will
be <tt>0xc0000</tt>.  And that is fine until one looks at the interactions with a
global memory management variable called <tt>max_low_pfn</tt>.  Given that
name, one might imagine that it is the maximum PFN contained within low
memory — the PFN of the highest page that is directly addressable by the
kernel without special mappings.  Instead, <tt>max_low_pfn</tt> is a
<i>count</i> of page frames in low memory.  But not all code appears to
treat it that way.
<p>
On an x86 system, where memory starts at a physical address of zero (and,
thus, a PFN of zero), that difference does not matter; the count and the
maximum are the same.  But on more
complicated systems the results can be interesting.  Returning to the same
function in <tt>blk-settings.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    blk_max_low_pfn = max_low_pfn - 1;  /* Done elsewhere at init time */

    if (b_pfn &lt; blk_max_low_pfn)
	dma = 1;
    q-&gt;limits.bounce_pfn = b_pfn;
</pre>
<p>

Here we have a real page frame number (calculated from the DMA mask)
compared to a count of page frames, with decisions on how DMA must be done
depending on the result.  It would not be surprising to see erroneous
results from such an operation; with regard to the discussion in question,
it seems to have caused bounce buffering to be done when there was no need.
One can easily see other kinds of trouble that could result from this type
of confusion; inconsistent views of what a variable means will rarely lead
to good things.

<p>
Fixing this situation is not going to be straightforward; Russell had "no
idea" of how to do it.  Renaming <tt>max_low_pfn</tt> to something like
<tt>low_pfn_count</tt> might be a first step as a way to avoid further
confusion.  Better defining the meaning of a DMA mask (or, at least,
ensuring that the kernel's interpretation of a mask adheres to the existing
definition) sounds like a good idea, but it could be hard to implement in a
way that does not break obscure hardware — some of that code can be fragile
indeed.  One way or another, it seems that the DMA interface, which was
designed by developers working with relatively straightforward hardware, is
going to need some attention from the ARM community if it's going to meet
that community's needs.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

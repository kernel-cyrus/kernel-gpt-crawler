The processor that one thinks of as "the" CPU is not the only processor on
most systems; indeed, it is often not the fastest.  Attached devices,
first and foremost the graphics processor (GPU), have their own processors
that can speed a number of
computing tasks.  They often have full access to system memory, but there
are obvious challenges to sharing that memory completely between the CPU
and other processors.  The heterogeneous memory management (HMM) subsystem aims
to make that sharing possible; Jérôme Glisse led a session on HMM for the
memory-management track at the 2016 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit.
<p>
The key feature of HMM, Jérôme said, is making it possible to mirror a
process's address space within the attached processor.  This should happen
without the need to use a special allocator in user space.  On the hardware
side, there are a couple of technologies out there that make this mirroring

easier.  One is the PowerPC CAPI interface; another is the PASID
mechanism for the PCI Express bus.  On the software side, options are to
either mirror the CPU's page table in the attached processor, or to migrate
pages back and forth between CPU and device memory.  Regardless of how this
is done, the hope is to present the same API to user space.
<p>
We care about this, Jérôme said, because the hardware is out there now; he
mentioned products from Mellanox and NVIDIA in particular.  Drivers exist
for this hardware which, he said, is expensive at the moment, but which
will get cheaper later this year.  If we don't provide a solution in the
kernel, things will run much more slowly and will require the pinning of
lots of memory.  It will be necessary to add more memory-management unit (MMU)
notifiers to device-driver code, which few see as desirable.  <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> support will only be
possible on integrated GPUs.  In general, he said, it is better to support
this capability in the kernel if possible.
<p>
The solution to these ills is the HMM patch set, which provides a simple
driver API for memory-management tasks.  It is able to mirror CPU page
tables on the attached device, and to keep those page tables synchronized
as things change on the CPU side.  Pages can be migrated between the CPU
and the device; a page that has been migrated away from the CPU is
represented by a special type of swap entry — it looks like it has been
paged out, in other words.  HMM also handles DMA mappings for the attached
device.
<p>
Andrew Morton noted that the patch set is "a ton of code," which always
makes it harder to get merged.  There was some talk of splitting the patch
set into more palatable pieces; some of the code, evidently, is also useful
for KVM virtualization.  Andrew told Jérôme to take care to document who
the potential users of this code are.  Then, he said, "it's a matter of getting
off our asses and reviewing the code."  There might be trouble, he said,
with the use of MMU notifiers, since Linus has been clear about his dislike
of notifiers in the past.
<p>
Overall, though, no objections to the core model were expressed.  The HMM
code has been in development for some years; maybe it is finally getting
closer to inclusion into the mainline kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Can anyone who was present expand on how HMM would be useful for KVM? I am not sure of the connection, besides the fact that KVM uses the MMU notifier mechanism.<br>

So i talked with Andrea about that, right now there is couple cases where you get an mmu_notifier_invalidate for things that have no impact on KVM. For instance when splitting huge pmd, the memory an address point to will be the same so there is no need to invalidate anything in KVM side (i do not think KVM care if an address range is back by huge page or by 4k pte entries). Right now mmu_notifier does not provide enough informations to distinguish between those different cases, my patchset add enough informations to figure this kind of thing. It would be a minor optimization but it might help a bit on some workload.<br>
<p>
Then there is the usecase of virtual device driver that want to do this from inside a virtual host. This is something that is further down the road.<br>

I guess it would be useful for implementing Linux support for NVIDIA CUDA 8.0 managed memory (migrating automatically from CPU to discrete-GPU memory): <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/cuda-8-features-revealed/">https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/cuda-8-feature...</a><br>

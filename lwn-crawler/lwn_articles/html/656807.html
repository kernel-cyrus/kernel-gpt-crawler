  Realtime virtualization may sound like an oxymoron to some,
but (with some caveats) it actually works and is yet another proof of the
flexibility of the Linux kernel. The first two presentations at <a
  href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum">KVM Forum
  2015</a> looked at realtime KVM from 
the ground up.  The speakers were Rik van Riel, who
covered the kernel side of the work (<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ5aTHeDLDE">YouTube video</a> and <a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/2/24/01x02-Rik_van_Riel-KVM_realtime.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>)
and Jan Kiszka, who explained how to configure the hosts and how to
manage realtime virtual machines (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyhfctYqjc8">YouTube video</a> and <a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/0/0d/01x03-Jan_Kiszska-KVM_RT_for_masses.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>).  This article recaps both talks, beginning with Van Riel's.

<h4>The <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> kernel</h4>

<p>
Realtime is about determinism, not speed.  Realtime workloads are those
where missing deadlines is bad: it results in voice breaking up in telecommunications
equipment, missed opportunities in stock trading, and exploding rockets in
vehicle control and avionics.  These applications can have thousands of deadlines
a second; the maximum allowed response time can be as low as a few dozen
microseconds, and it has to be met 99.999% of the time, if not ... just always.
Speed is useful, but guaranteeing this kind of latency bound almost always
results in lower throughput.

<p>
Nearly every latency source in a system comes from the kernel.  For example,
a driver could disable interrupts and prevent high-priority programs from
being scheduled.  Spinlocks are another cause of latency in a non-realtime kernel,
because Linux cannot <tt>schedule()</tt> while holding a spinlock.
These issues can be controlled by running a kernel built with <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>,
the realtime kernel patch set.
A <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> kernel tries  hard to make every part of the Linux
kernel preemptible, except for short sections of code.

<p>
Most of the required changes have been merged into Linus's kernel
tree: kernel preemption
support, 
priority inheritance, high-resolution timers, support for interrupt handling in
threads, 
annotation 
of "raw" spinlocks, and <tt>NO_HZ_FULL</tt> mode.  The <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>
patch, while still 
large, has to do much less than it used to.  The main three things it
does are: turn non-raw spinlocks into mutexes with priority inheritance,
actually run all interrupt handlers in threads so that realtime tasks can
preempt them, 
and an <a href="/Articles/253651/">RCU implementation</a> that supports
preemption.  

<p>
The main remaining problem is in firmware.  System management interrupts (SMIs)
for x86 take care of things such as fan speed, even on servers.  SMIs cannot be
blocked by the operating system and can take up to milliseconds to run in
extreme cases.  During this time, the operating system is completely
blocked from running. 
There is no solution other than buying hardware that behaves well.  A kernel
module, <tt>hwlatdetect</tt>, can help detect the problem; it blocks
interrupts on a CPU,  
looks for unexpected latency spikes, and uses model-specific registers
(MSRs) to correlate the spikes to SMIs.

<h4>Realtime virtualization, really?</h4>

<p>
Now, realtime virtualization may sound implausible, but it can be done.
Of course, there are problems: for example, the priority of the tasks in
the virtual machine (VM)
is not visible to the host and neither are lock holders inside a guest.  This
limits the scheduler's flexibility and prevents priority inheritance, so all
of the virtual CPUs (VCPUs) have to be placed at a very high priority.  Only <a
href="/Articles/520076/"><tt>ksoftirqd</tt></a> has a higher priority,
since it delivers interrupts to the virtual CPUs.  In order to avoid starving the
host, systems have to be partitioned between CPUs running system tasks
and isolated CPUs (marked with the <tt>isolcpus</tt> and <tt>nohz_full</tt>
kernel command-line 
arguments) running realtime guests.  The guest has to be partitioned in the same
way between realtime VCPUs and those that run generic tasks.  The latter could
occasionally cause exits to the host user space, which are potentially long
and&mdash;much like SMIs on bare metal&mdash;prevent the guest scheduler from
running.

<p>
Thus, a virtualized realtime guest uses more resources than the same workload
running on bare-metal, and those resources have to be dedicated to a
particular guest. 
But this can be an acceptable price to pay for the improved isolation,
manageability, and
hardware compatibility that virtualization provides.  In addition, lately each
generation 
of processors has made more and more cores available within one CPU
socket; 
Moore's Law seems to be compensating for this problem, at least for now.

<p>
Once the design of realtime KVM was worked out as above, the remaining piece is
to fix the bugs.  A lot of the fixes were
either not specific to KVM, or not specific to <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>, so they will benefit
all real-time users and all virtualization users.  For example, RCU was changed
to have an <a href="/Articles/636123/">extended quiescent state</a>
while the guest runs.  <tt>NOHZ_FULL</tt> support was extended to disable
the timer tick 
altogether when running a <tt>SCHED_FIFO</tt> (realtime) task. In this
case, that task will not
be rescheduled, because anything with a higher priority would have already
preempted it, so the 
timer tick is not needed.  A few knobs were added to disable unnecessary KVM
features 
that can introduce latency, such as synchronization of time from the host to
the guest; this can take several microseconds and the solution is simply to run
<tt>ntpd</tt> in the guest.

<p>
Virtualization overhead can be limited by using <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>'s
"<a href="/Articles/577370/">simple wait queues</a>" 
instead of the full-blown Linux wait queues.  These only take locks for a
bounded time so that the length of the operations is also bounded (wakeups
often happen from interrupt handlers, so their cost directly affects
latency).  Merging 
simple wait queues in the mainline kernel <a href="/Articles/653586/">is
being discussed</a>.

<p>
Another trick is to schedule KVM's timers a little in advance to compensate for
the overhead of injecting virtual interrupts.  It takes a few microseconds for
the hypervisor to pass an interrupt down to the guest, and a parameter in the
<tt>kvm</tt> kernel module allows for tuning the adjustment based on the
guest's 
benchmarked latency.

<p>
And finally, new processor technology can help too.  This is the case for
Intel's "<a
href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/communications/cache-monitoring-cache-allocation-technologies.html">Cache
Allocation Technology</a>" (CAT), available on some Haswell CPUs. 
The combined cost of loads from DRAM and TLB misses can cause a
single uncached context switch to add up to over 50 microseconds.
CAT allows reserving parts of the cache to specific applications,
preventing one workload from evicting another workload from the cache,
and it is controlled nicely with a control-groups-based interface.  The patches,
however, have not yet been included in Linux.

<p>
The results, measured with <a href="https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Cyclictest">cyclictest</a>, are surprisingly good.  Bare-metal latencies
are less than 2 microseconds, but KVM's measurement of 6-microsecond
latencies is also a very 
good result.  To achieve these numbers, of course, the system needs to be
carefully set up to
avoid all kinds of high-latency system operations: no CPU frequency changes,
no CPU hotplug, no loading or unloading of kernel modules, and no swapping.  The
applications also have to be tuned to avoid slow devices (e.g. disks or sound
devices) except in non-realtime helper programs.  So deploying realtime KVM
requires deep knowledge of the 
system (for example, to ensure the time stamp counter  is stable and the system
will never fall back 
to another clock source) and the workload.  Some new bottlenecks will be found
as people use realtime KVM more, but the work on the kernel side is, in general,
proceeding well.

<h4>"Can I have this in my cloud?"</h4>

<p>
At this point, Van Riel left the stage to Kiszka, who talked more about the host
configuration, how to automate it, and how to manage the
systems with libvirt and OpenStack.

<p>
Kiszka is a long-time KVM contributor who works for Siemens.  He 
started using KVM many years ago to tackle hardware-compatibility <a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/f/f3/2010-kvm-forum-Embedded-KVM.pdf">problems
with legacy software [PDF]</a>.  He has been <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIDwc6uDszY">toying with realtime KVM
[YouTube]</a>
for several years, and people are now asking: "Can I have this in my
cloud?".

<p>
The answer is "yes", but there are some restrictions.
This is not something for a public cloud, of course.  Doing realtime
control for an 
industrial plant will not go well if you need to do I/O from some data
center far away.  "The cloud" here is a private cloud with a fast
Ethernet link between the industrial process and the virtual machine.
Many features of a cloud environment will also be left behind, because they
do not provide deterministic latencies.  For example, the realtime path
must not use disks or live migration, but this is generally not a problem.

<p>
In going beyond the basic configuration that Van Riel had explained, the
first thing to look at is networking.  Most of QEMU is still protected
by a "big QEMU lock", and device passthrough has latency problems too.
While progress is being made on these fronts, it's already possible to
use a paravirtualized device (virtio-net) together with a non-QEMU backend.

<p>
KVM supports two such virtio-net backends, namely vhost-net and
vhost-user.  vhost-net lies in the kernel; it connects a TAP device from
the Linux network stack to a virtio-net device in a virtual machine.
However, it does not have acceptable latency, yet, either.  vhost-user,
instead, lets any user-space process provide networking, and can be used
together with specialized network libraries.

<p>
Examples of realtime-capable network libraries include <a
href="http://dpdk.org/">Data Plane Development Kit</a> (DPDK) or <a
href="https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch/blob/master/README.md">SnabbSwitch</a>.  
 These alternative stacks opt for an aggressive polling strategy; this
reduces the amount of event signaling and, as consequence, latency as
well.  Kiszka's set up uses DPDK as a vhost-user client; of course, it
runs at a realtime priority too. For the client to deliver
interrupts to VCPUs in a timely fashion, it has to be placed at a higher
priority than the 
VCPU threads.

<p>
Kiszka's application does not have high packet rates, so a single physical
CPU is 
enough to run the switch for all the network interfaces in the systems;
more demanding 
applications might require one physical CPU for each interface.

<p>
After prototyping realtime virtualization in the lab, moving it to the
data center requires a lot more work.  There are hundreds of VMs and many
different 
networks, some of them realtime and some not; that needs to managed and
accounted for
flexibly.  This requires a cloud-management stack, so OpenStack was chosen
and extended with realtime capabilities.  The reference architecture then includes (from
the bottom up): the <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> kernel, QEMU (which has to be there
for the guest's 
non-realtime tasks and to set up the vhost-user switch), the DPDK-based switch,
libvirt, and OpenStack.  Each host, or "compute node", is set up with isolated
physical CPUs as explained in the first half of the talk.  IRQ affinities
also have 
to be set explicitly (or through the irqbalance daemon) because, by
default, they 
do not respect the kernel's <tt>isolcpus</tt> setting.  But, depending on
the workload, little tuning may be needed and, in any case, the setup is easily
replicated if there are many similar hosts.  There is also a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/OpenEneaLinux/rt-tools">partrt</a> that
helps to set up isolation.

<h4>Libvirt and OpenStack</h4>

<p>
Higher up comes libvirt, which doesn't require much policy, as it only executes
commands from the higher layers.  All required tunables are available in libvirt
1.2.13: setting the scheduling parameters (policy, priority, pinning to physical
CPUs), asking QEMU to <tt>mlock()</tt> all guest RAM, and starting VMs
connected to vhost-user 
processes.  The consumer for these parameters is OpenStack's
compute-node-handling <a
href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova">Nova</a>  component.

<p>
Nova can already be configured to enable VCPU pinning and dedicated
physical CPUs.  Other 
settings, though, are missing in OpenStack, and are being discussed in <a
href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/139688">a blueprint</a>. 
While it is not yet complete (for example it doesn't support associating
non-realtime 
physical CPUs to non-realtime QEMU threads), the blueprint will enable the
usage of 
the remaining 
libvirt knobs.  Patches for it are being discussed and the target is
OpenStack's "Mitaka" release, due in the first half of 2016.  Kiszka's team
is integrating the patches into its deployment; the team will come up with
extensions to the patches and to the blueprint.

<p>
OpenStack also controls networking through the <a
href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron">Neutron</a> component.
However, realtime networks tend to be special: they might not use TCP/IP
at all, and Neutron really wants to manage its networks in its own way.
Siemens is thus introducing "unmanaged" networks (which do no DHCP and
possibly even no IP) into Neutron.

<p>
All in all, work in the higher layers of the stack is mostly about
standardizing the basic setup of realtime-capable compute nodes, and a
lot of the work will be about improving the tuning process in tools such
as partrt.  As mentioned during the Q&amp;A session, <a
href="https://fedorahosted.org/tuned/">tuned</a> is also being 
extended to support a realtime tuning profile.  However, Kiszka also plans to
take another look lower in the stack; the newest chipsets have <a
href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/technology/virtualization/vt-directed-io-spec.html">functionality</a> that eliminates interrupt
  latency introduced when assigning devices directly to VMs by
  directly routing the interrupt without involving the hypervisor.
In addition, Kiszka's <a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/2/24/2012-forum-Jan-Kiszka-BQL.pdf">older work [PDF]</a> to let QEMU emulate realtime devices could be brought
back sometime in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I understand that in realtime context, you want less non-determinism, and therefore turn HT off.<br>
<p>
But in general computing, where do you see the problem? A hyperthread that is idle should not block your single-threaded workload, no?<br>

The problem comes when two threads get assigned to the same physical core, while another physical core sits idle.<br>
<p>
Generally if # of active threads &lt;= # of physical cores, you can squeeze out better performance by disabling hyperthreading.<br>

      Isn't this a scheduler bug, then? (The scheduler is aware of which CPUs are assigned to what physical cores&hellip;)

it's a hardware issue too, though it depends a bit on the underlying computer architecture.<br>
<p>
For example, often with hyperthreading enabled each thread splits the L1 cache in half.  So your threads have effectively half as much cache as they would if it were disabled.  For some benchmarks this can hurt performance.<br>
<p>
There are other resources that are shared too with multithreading, especially execution units and memory bandwidth.<br>
<p>
I know it's not really considered the best benchmark, but on many of my machines LINPACK will actually run slower on machines with hyperthreading enabled than with it turned off, even though it means only half as many threads are available.<br>

It depends on the workload. The scheduler is also aware that process migration is bad because of cache and TLB misses.<br>

      <i>"the priority of the tasks in the virtual machine (VM) is not visible to the host and neither are lock holders inside a guest"</i>
<p>
I was wondering about this statement during the talk.  Assuming the VM is running Linux, can't it be modified to make some hypercalls to share this information with the host?

Then the VM is highly coupled with the host. VM loses isolation and independence. <br>

Hello! For some reasons, I was wondering how can someone try real time virtualization out, under a lab environment? Is having a real time kernel built enough? Or something has to be done with KVM as well? I was hoping that KVM on a RT kernel gets RT performance automatically? Thanks in advance!<br>

</div>
<p>
The recent <a href="/Articles/752063/"><tt>fsync()</tt> woes</a>
experienced by 
PostgreSQL led to a <a href="/Articles/752613/">session</a> on the first
day (April&nbsp;23) of the 2018 Linux 
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).  Those problems
also led 
to a second-day session with PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund who gave an
overview of how PostgreSQL does I/O and where that ran aground on some
assumptions that had been made.  The session led to a fair amount of
discussion with the filesystem-track developers; real solutions seem to be
in the offing.
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL is process-based; there are no threads used, Freund said.  It does
write-ahead logging (WAL) for durability and replication.  That means it
logs data before it is marked dirty and the log is flushed before the dirty
data is written.  Checkpointing is done in the background with writes that
are throttled as needed.  In general, all data I/O is buffered, though the
WAL can use direct I/O.
</p>

</a>

<p>
There is a per-process file descriptor cache with a size limited by the
kernel configuration and <tt>ulimit</tt>, so file descriptors are closed if
there are not enough available.  On Linux, the dirty data is forced to
storage by an 
explicit <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync_file_range.2.html"><tt>sync_file_range()</tt></a>
with the <tt>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</tt> flag.  Writes come from several
sources: the checkpointer writes sorted pages, the background writer does
largely random writes, and the backends do random writes.  The latter two
are pre-cleaning or cleaning various pages, Freund said.
</p>

<p>
After that brief overview of PostgreSQL I/O, he moved into the issues the
project has run into with <tt>fsync()</tt>.  To start with, the guarantees
made by Linux (or POSIX) with respect to <tt>fsync()</tt> behavior are not
well documented.  One wrong assumption that was made was that retrying an
<tt>fsync()</tt> will fail if the underlying problem has not been fixed.
Other operating systems (FreeBSD and Solaris, at least) do have that
behavior.  Handling that difference is fairly straightforward, he said.
</p>

<p>
A bigger problem is that it was assumed that <tt>fsync()</tt> would return
an error if there was a writeback failure, which is not necessarily true
for Linux.  That was never reliable, but it got a bit worse for PostgreSQL
after the <a href="/Articles/724307/">introduction of
<tt>errseq_t</tt></a>, which is what led to the recent fallout.  Matthew Wilcox
has a <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/23/994">patch</a> that makes
things better, but still provides no guarantee.  In order for all of that
to work, however, PostgreSQL would need to have at least one  file
descriptor that stays open from the earliest write, which is not possible
at the moment.  It is not just PostgreSQL that is affected, Freund said,
backup tools, rsync, and others are impacted as well.
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein asked if there were tests to reproduce the problems that
PostgreSQL is seeing.  Freund said the project has some, but that they need
to improve.  A crash framework that uses device-mapper failure injection is
under development, he said.  Ted Ts'o said that xfstests has ways to do
that kind of testing as well, so PostgreSQL should look into that for ideas
and code.
</p>

<p>
Freund said that some have suggested that using direct I/O (DIO) would be a
solution for the database system.  There are architectural issues that make
DIO perform poorly for PostgreSQL, but the project is working on them.  In
addition, DIO is only going to be useful for well-tuned databasesâ€”many
installed PostgreSQL databases are not.
</p>

<p>
One of the possible solutions that PostgreSQL has investigated is to pass
file descriptors to the checkpointer, which is what will be calling
<tt>fsync()</tt>.  One of the problems with that is to figure out which
descriptor for the file is the oldest.  Wilcox asked whether the
descriptors that need to be closed could be synced before they are closed.
That would be too slow, Freund said, since there are potentially hundreds
or thousands 
of file descriptors that would be affected.
</p>

<p>
David Howells asked if a new option to <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fadvise64.2.html"><tt>fadvise64()</tt></a>
that returns the error count would be helpful.  Freund said that would
 be one of the best solutions to the problems PostgreSQL is
having.  A per-filesystem error count would be sufficient; the database
would then figure out what it needed to do from that.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara said that, for the near term, the plan should be to get Wilcox's
patch merged and to work up a patch to keep inodes with errors in memory,
as had been discussed the day before.  If those inodes are not evicted, the
errors can be reliably reported.  Since then, the patch from Wilcox <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b4678df184b314a2bd47d2329feca2c2534aa12b">has
been merged</a>, with the stable kernel team being copied, so it should
appear in stable kernels too before long.
</p>

<p>
There was talk of some way to monitor the kernel log for I/O errors (or to
get that kind of information reported via netlink sockets, as Google
does).  That would work, Freund said, but it is overkill.  In the end,
PostgreSQL does not really care what the error is, just that it occurred.
In addition, a fix that doesn't require rsync, tar, and others to change in
order to 
receive errors that
way is much preferred.
</p>

<p>
In closing, Freund asked for some documentation that would tell application
developers what needs to be done in order to durably write their data to
disk.  Dave Chinner claimed that was "asking too much", to a fair amount of
laughter.  On the other hand, though, no one really stepped up to say they
planned to write said documentation either.  Freund did <a
href="/Articles/753184/">post</a> a summary of what he learned at LSFMM to
the pgsql-hackers mailing list.

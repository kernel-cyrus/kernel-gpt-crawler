<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 17, 2016</br>
           </div>
One of the many interesting aspects to kernel development is that much of
the kernel's functionality is, itself, not available to the kernel.  Most
system calls are not intended to be called internally.  Traditionally, this
feature gap has extended to the reading of files from the filesystem, an
act which tends to look like the implementation of policy within the
kernel and, potentially, opens up security issues; thus it has long been
discouraged.
<p>
Over time, though, we have seen the introduction of kernel code that does,
indeed, read files.  The first step in that direction was probably the <a
href="/Articles/10921/">in-kernel module loader</a>, which replaced the
user-space loader back in 2002.  The module loader does not actually open
files; it depends on user space to hand it a file descriptor corresponding
to the module to be loaded.  But, given that, it does read the module code
directly, perform the necessary symbol resolution, and bind it into the
kernel.
<p>
The door opened wider when the firmware-loading mechanism was moved
in-kernel; in this case, the file containing the firmware is being opened
by name from within the kernel.  The <a href="/Articles/227937/">integrity
management architecture</a> code also has to open files, and it seems
likely that other uses will show up over time.  Since there is no standard
way to open and read a file within the kernel, there is a separate
implementation for each of these users, each of which does things in its
own way.
<p>
Mimi Zohar recently decided that it was time to make file reading a
first-class supported operation within the kernel; the result is <a
href="/Articles/675665/">this patch set</a> adding a common file loader.
It makes this operation easier to perform, but, as will be seen, it still
seems like it's not really meant for common use.
<p>
At the lowest level, Mimi's patch set adds a new function to read a file's
contents into memory:
<p>
<pre>
    int kernel_read_file(struct file *file, void **buf, loff_t *size,
		         loff_t max_size, enum kernel_read_file_id id);
</pre>
<p>
This function will read the data from the open file indicated by
<tt>file</tt>; up to <tt>max_size</tt> bytes will be read.  It will
allocate a buffer (using <tt>vmalloc()</tt>) to hold the file's contents,
storing a pointer in <tt>*buf</tt>; the caller should free the buffer when
it is no longer needed.  The actual length of the file will be
placed in <tt>*size</tt>.  If the file is larger than <tt>max_size</tt>,
nothing will be allocated or read, and <tt>-EFBIG</tt> will be returned.
<p>
The <tt>id</tt> argument is, arguably, where the interface (intentionally)
loses a bit of 
generality.  It is an <tt>enum</tt> type meant to indicate the purpose for
which the file is being read; the values defined in the patch are
<tt>READING_KEXEC_IMAGE</tt>,
<tt>READING_KEXEC_INITRAMFS</tt>,
<tt>READING_FIRMWARE</tt>,
<tt>READING_MODULE</tt>, and
<tt>READING_POLICY</tt>.  The <tt>READING_POLICY</tt> option appears to be
the motivation for the patch set; the IMA code can use it to read the
policy and perform signature checking on the policy file.  Developers
wanting to use this interface will, most likely, have to add their own
<tt>kernel_read_file_id</tt> constant to describe what they are doing.
<p>
There are a couple of helpers built on top of <tt>kernel_read_file()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int kernel_read_file_from_path(char *path, void **buf, loff_t *size,
			       	   loff_t max_size,
				   enum kernel_read_file_id id);
    int kernel_read_file_from_fd(int fd, void **buf, loff_t *size,
    				 loff_t max_size, enum kernel_read_file_id id);
</pre>
<p>

As might be expected, the first one opens and reads a file given its
pathname, while the second takes an open file descriptor and reads from
that.
<p>
One advantage to implementing this functionality in a single place is that
it becomes possible to apply a uniform security policy in all settings where
the kernel tries to read a file.  To that end, Mimi's patch set adds two
new security hooks (<tt>security_kernel_read_file()</tt> and
<tt>security_kernel_post_read_file()</tt>) that can pass judgment on
file-reading operations.  The <tt>security_kernel_module_from_file()</tt>
and <tt>security_kernel_fw_from_file()</tt>
hooks have been removed in favor of the new hooks.  This is the purpose of the
<tt>kernel_file_read_id</tt> parameter described above; it is passed to the
loaded security module(s) and can be checked by the current security
policy.
<p>
This patch set has been through a few revisions and has gotten
acknowledgments from a number of the relevant developers.  At this point,
there would appear to be few obstacles between it and the mainline kernel.
So, in the near future, the kernel is likely to have a set of generic
functions for opening and reading files, but any future users will have to
tell the kernel what they are up to.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Personally, I like how the Linux kernel is organically growing into a microkernel.<br>
<p>
On recent processors with SMAP/SMEP, most parts of the kernel no longer have full control over the memory. Low-overhead IPC is (hopefully) coming soon with KDBUS/BUS1. Drivers for slow USB devices are in userspace. Filesystems can be written in userspace with FUSE. Now kernel code can access files similarly to how userspace programs do.<br>
<p>
I suppose one day the division between the core and the rest of the kernel will be clear and enforced. And they will live in the same repository only for historical reasons.<br>

Interesting that you'd post this in response to an article about how the kernel reads files from the filesystem of its own accord. Doesn't sound very much like a microkernel to me.<br>
<p>
Actually I think it's a pity that firmware loading policy ended up moving into the kernel. The reasons for that were more to do with interpersonal friction than sound technical reasons.<br>

If you look at it really, really vaguely it's kind of making the kernel more like a userspace program.<br>
<p>
(Only, of course, you have to look at it so vaguely that more or less all facts are blurred away. The kernel is wildly different from a userspace program, and no file-reading API will change that.)<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, and the kernel has always been able to read files for implementing read, too :-)
<p>
Exec is essentially a file operation (it even has its own file permission bit).  That puts it in a different class from kernel facilities that <em>use</em> files.  The latter smells of a layering violation.

I was under the impression that what exec() does with files is more closely related to mmap() than to read().

before the kernel can mmap files into the userland part of the address space it has to know what and where to map and for that it needs to read and parse the ELF program headers of the main executable (and the interpreter if needed). see fs/exec.c:kernel_read() and its uses for the gory details.<br>

Makes sense to me (thank you for the clarification).
</p>
<p>
The important point as far as I'm concerned is that the kernel doesn't “read” a large executable into memory in its entirety before it is started, but maps it into memory and fetches pages from the file as required according to page faults arising from running the code.

yes, that's how it works for userland maps however note that kernel_read has other uses such as the module loader which does read in the entire module file (finit_module-&gt;copy_module_from_fd-&gt;kernel_read).<br>

      This is an internal kernel interface, it can be easily changed if need be.

<a href="/Articles/185666/">Lockdep</a> is a runtime locking correctness
validator that detects and 
reports a deadlock or its possibility by checking dependencies between
locks. It's useful since it does not report just an actual deadlock
but also the possibility of a deadlock that has not actually happened yet.
That enables problems to be fixed before they affect real systems.
<p>
However, this facility is only applicable to typical locks, such as
spinlocks and mutexes, which are normally released within the 
context in which they were acquired. Under that assumption, the lockdep
implementation becomes simple but its capacity for detection is
limited, with the result that it cannot find all possible deadlocks.
In particular, synchronization primitives like page locks or completions,
which are allowed to be 
released in any context, also create dependencies and can cause a deadlock.
So lockdep should track these locks to do a better job; it
would be useful for these locks as well if we were able to identify dependencies
created by them. The proposed "crossrelease" feature provides a way to do that.
<p>

A page lock is used to ensure exclusive access to a <tt>page</tt>
structure; it is allowed to be released in a context other than that in
which it was acquired.  For example, a page lock could be acquired in
process context, then released in software interrupt context after the
event it is waiting for has occurred.  
With the <a href="/Articles/708628/">proposed crossrelease feature</a>, the
page-lock-related deadlock in the following example can be 
detected, which cannot be done by current lockdep.
<p>

<p>

In this example, Y acquires the mutex A, then waits for B (a page lock)
while holding A. Z, which can release B, is waiting for A; since A is held
by Y, Z is blocked and cannot release B. In other words, both Y and Z are
waiting for events which can never happen. It's a deadlock.  <p> How can we
detect that kind of deadlock? Let's see the way starting from lockdep
fundamentals.

<p>

<h4>Lockdep fundamentals</h4>
<p>

A deadlock occurs when a context is waiting for an event to happen, but
that event is impossible because another context that can trigger the event
is also waiting for another event to happen, and that second event is also
impossible due to the same reason.
<p>

A dependency might exist between two waiters and a deadlock might happen
due to an incorrect relationship between dependencies. Thus, we have to define
what a dependency is first. A dependency exists between if:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> There are two waiters waiting for each event at a given time.
<li> The only way to wake up each waiter is to trigger its event.
<li> The ability for one to be woken up depends on whether the other can.
</ul>
<p>

If any partial set of dependencies forms a loop, for example, "A-&gt;B"
and "B-&gt;A" (where "A-&gt;B" means that event A depends on event B), then it
might lead to a deadlock since no waiter can meet its condition to
wake up. Thus, detecting circular dependencies is a key to detecting the
possibility of a deadlock.
Precisely speaking, a dependency is one between whether a waiter for an
event can be woken up and whether another waiter for another event can
be woken up. However from now on, we will describe a dependency as if
it's one between an event and another event for simplicity.
The purpose of lockdep is to track these dependencies in a graph and identify
situations where circular dependencies are created.

<p>
For example, consider a graph built by lockdep that looks like:
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/crossrelease1.png" alt="[Lockdep graph]">
</blockquote>
In this diagram, each node is a specific lock class, and the arrows
indicate dependencies between those locks.

Lockdep will add a dependency into the graph whenever a new dependency is
detected. For example, it will add a dependency "E-&gt;C" when a new
dependency between lock E and lock C is detected. Then the graph will be:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/crossrelease2.png" alt="[Lockdep graph]">
</blockquote>
<p>
This graph contains a subgraph which demonstrates a circular dependency:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/crossrelease3.png" alt="[Lockdep graph]">
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the sort of condition under which a deadlock might occur. Lockdep
reports it on detection after adding a new dependency.
<p>
<h4>What crossrelease does</h4>
<p>

Detecting and adding dependencies into the graph is important for
lockdep to work; adding a dependency is the opportunity to
check whether it might cause a deadlock. The more dependencies are added,
the more thoroughly it can work. Therefore, lockdep has to do its best to
add as many true dependencies as possible into the graph.
By relaxing the assumption that locks must be released within their
acquisition context, lockdep can add more dependencies reflecting how new
types of locks, such as page locks or completions, are used.
<p>
Any dependency, for example "A-&gt;B", can be identified only in the
context where A is released.  
That is not a problem for typical locks, because each acquisition context
is same as 
its release context, thus lockdep can determine the dependencies
at acquisition time. However, for "crosslocks" (those released in a
different context), lockdep
cannot make the decision in the acquire context but has to wait until
the release context is finally identified.

Therefore, lockdep has to queue all acquisitions which might create
dependencies until the decision can be made. In this way, true
dependencies can also be identified even for crosslocks.
<p>

<h4>How crossrelease works</h4>
<p>
As described above, lockdep queues all acquisitions until their
true dependencies can be identified, and then adds the dependencies into
the graph in batches. We call this new step "commit", which is the key for
the crossrelease feature to work. 

Lockdep works well even without commit for typical locks. However,
the commit step is necessary once crosslocks are involved, until all
outstanding crosslocks are released. With the introduction of commit, lockdep
performs three steps: acquisition, commit, and release. What lockdep does in
each step is:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Acquisition</b>: For a typical lock,
      lockdep does what it originally did and queues the lock so that
      lockdep can check dependencies using it at the commit step.  
      Crosslocks are added to a global linked list so that lockdep can
      check dependencies at the commit step.
<p>
<li> <b>Commit</b>: No action is required for typical locks.  For crosslocks,
      lockdep adds true dependencies using the data saved at the
      acquisition step.
<p>
<li> <b>Release</b>: No changes are required for typical locks.  When a
     crosslock is released, lockdep just removes the crosslock from the
     linked list.
</ul>
<p>
By queuing data properly and performing the commit step, lockdep is able to 
track dependencies created by both typical locks and crosslocks.
<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>

Detecting a deadlock (or the possibility of one) involving locks that are
allowed to 
be released in any context may look impossible, but it's not. 
The crossrelease feature is designed to do deadlock detection
in a more general way. So both typical locks and crosslocks can
be handled by the feature. However, since the assumption that locks
are released within their acquisition context makes the lockdep implementation
simple and efficient, the original algorithm using this assumption is
preferred when possible. 
However, we cannot avoid using the crossrelease feature if we want to make
lockdep also 
work for crosslocks.
<p>
Crossrelease makes lockdep able to handle more dependencies, which
cannot be done by the lockdep implementation. Yet, there might possibly be more
dependencies that cannot be handled even by crossrelease. If so, we will
have to make the additional ones work by enhancing crossrelease
or introducing another feature. Currently, crossrelease cannot
identify some dependencies between two crosslocks since it's a rather
complex problem.  Work on that issue is currently in progress.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

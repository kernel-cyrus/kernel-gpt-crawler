<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 14, 2020</br>
           </div>
Back in November 2019, Mike Rapoport <a href="/Articles/803823/">made
the case</a> that there is too much address-space sharing in Linux
systems.  This sharing can be convenient and good for performance, but in
an era of advanced attacks and hardware vulnerabilities it also facilitates
security problems.  At that time, he proposed a number of possible changes
in general terms; he has now come back with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200130162340.GA14232@rapoport-lnx/">a patch</a>
implementing a couple of address-space isolation options for the <a
href="/Articles/593918/">memfd</a> mechanism.  This work demonstrates the
sort of features we may be seeing, but some of the hard work has been left
for the future.
<p>
Sharing of address spaces comes about in a number of ways.  Linux has
traditionally mapped the kernel's address space into every user-space
process; doing so improves performance in a number of ways.  This sharing
was thought to be secure for years, since the mapping doesn't allow user
space to actually access that memory.  The Meltdown and Spectre hardware
bugs, though, rendered this sharing insecure; thus <a
href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> was merged to
break that sharing.
<p>
Another form of sharing takes place in the processor's memory caches; once
again, hardware vulnerabilities can expose data cached in this shared
area.  Then there is the matter of the kernel's direct map: a large mapping
(in kernel space) that contains all of physical memory.  This mapping makes
life easy for the kernel, but it also means that <i>all</i> user-space
memory is shared with the kernel.  In other words, an attacker with even a
limited ability to run code in the kernel context may have easy access to
all memory in the system.  Once again, in an era of speculative-execution
bugs, that is not necessarily a good thing.
<p>
The memfd subsystem wasn't designed for address-space isolation; indeed,
its initial purpose was as a sort of interprocess communication mechanism.
It does, however, provide a way to create a memory region attached to a
file descriptor with specific characteristics; a memfd can be "sealed", for
example, so that a recipient knows that it will not be changed.  
Rapoport decided that it would be a good foundation on which to build a
"secret memory" feature.
<p>
Actually creating an isolated memory area requires passing a new flag to
<tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create()</a></tt>
called <tt>MFD_SECRET</tt>.  That, however, doesn't describe <i>how</i>
this secrecy should be implemented.  There are a number of options that
offer varying levels of security and performance degradation, so the user
has to make a decision.  The available options, as implemented in the
patch, could easily have been specified directly to <tt>memfd_create()</tt>
with their own flags,
but Rapoport decided to require the use of a separate <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl()</a></tt>
call instead.  Until the secrecy mode has been specified with this call,
the user cannot map the memfd, and thus cannot actually make use of it.
<p>
There are two modes implemented so far; the first of them,
<tt>MFD_SECRET_EXCLUSIVE</tt>, does a number of things to hide the memory
attached to the memfd from prying eyes.  That memory is 
marked as being unevictable, for example, so it will never be flushed out
to swap.  The effect is similar to calling <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html">mlock()</a></tt>,
but with a couple of differences: pages are not actually allocated until
they are faulted in, and the limit on the number of locked pages appears to
be (perhaps by mistake) implemented separately from the limits imposed by
<tt>mlock()</tt>.  There is also no way to unlock pages except by
destroying the memfd, which requires unmapping it and closing its file descriptor.
<p>
The other thing done by <tt>MFD_SECRET_EXCLUSIVE</tt> is to remove the
pages used by the memfd from the kernel's direct map, making it
inaccessible from kernel space.  The problem with this is that the direct
map is normally set up using huge pages, which makes accessing it far more
efficient.  Removing individual (small) pages forces huge pages to be
broken apart into lots of small pages, slowing the system for everybody.  The current code
(admittedly a proof of concept) allocates each page independently when it
is faulted in, which seems likely to maximize the damage done to the direct
mapping.  That will need to change before this feature could be seriously
considered for merging.
<p>
The other mode,
<tt>MFD_SECRET_UNCACHED</tt> does everything <tt>MFD_SECRET_EXCLUSIVE</tt>
does, but also causes the memory to be mapped with caching disabled.
That will prevent its contents from ever living in the processor's memory
caches, rendering it inaccessible to exploits that use any of a number of hardware
vulnerabilities.  It also makes access to that memory far slower in
general, to the point that it may seem inaccessible to the intended user as
well.  For small amounts of infrequently accessed data (cryptographic keys,
for example) it may be a useful option, though.
<p>
In its current form, the feature only allows one mode to be selected.  In
truth, though, <tt>MFD_SECRET_UNCACHED</tt> is a strict superset of
<tt>MFD_SECRET_EXCLUSIVE</tt>, so that is not currently a problem.
Rapoport suggests that this whole API could change in the future, with an
alternative being "<q>something like 'secrecy level' from 'a bit more
secret than normally' to 'do your best even at the expense of
performance'</q>".
<p>
Part of the purpose behind this posting was to get comments on the proposed
API, but those have not been forthcoming so far.  This may be one of those
projects that has to advance further — and get closer to being merge-ready
— before developers will take notice.  But at least the work itself is not
a secret anymore, so interested users can start to think about whether it
meets their needs or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Theoretically.  But, rowhammer is also most effective when you can get access to *lots* of memory so you can find flips of value between pages with special physical relationships on the media.  This mechanism is at least limited by RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, which means that normal users can't normally get large swaths of it.  <br>

I would expect it too but for a PoC that might be implied only - there is absolutely 0 chance for this PoC to be merged, so it should noly serve as a basis for discussion. <br>

Anyway, I like the idea - although I'm wondering if hiding memory from the kernel would not allow some kind of abuse (like hiding malicious stuff).<br>

It'd be nice if this enables the use of hardware encryption widgets like SME transparently. AIUI it can't safely be turned on globally because some drivers expect to be able to peek and poke shared memory - but if an area's explicitly flagged as secret that shouldn't be an obstacle. Having the contents encrypted at rest would also mean it's safe to swap out (as long as the key isn't!).<br>

That depends on the hardware details - e.g. I believe some common ARM TrustZone implementations can mark regions of memory as inaccessible to the DMA controller, the GPU, the CPU, etc, which sounds like it could be useful here. (Sometimes used for DRM video decoding, where the decrypted bitstream and decoded frames are accessible to the VPU/GPU/display and not to the CPU, but it could be configured the other way round.)<br>

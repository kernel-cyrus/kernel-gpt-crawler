<h1>3.16 merge window, part 1</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 4, 2014</br>
           </div>
<p>
The merge window for the 3.16 kernel might be showing us a glimpse of a
future where kernel releases happen even more frequently than they do
today.   
By opening the window for 3.16 before the final release of the 3.15 kernel,
Linus Torvalds may have shaved a week off the time between the two kernels. The 
length of kernel development cycles has generally trended downward, but
has leveled off between 60 and 70 days for recent releases. While
Torvalds's reason for overlapping the development cycles of two kernels—a
family vacation—may not recur anytime soon, he may find that some
parallelism in kernel development suits his purposes moving forward.
</p>

<p>
So, unlike previous merge windows, Torvalds is juggling two branches for a
week—or possibly longer if serious problems pop up in -rc8.  There is the
mainline (or "master") branch on his tree that is accumulating
the—hopefully small—fixes that are going into 3.15.  In addition, he is
managing a "next" branch that is collecting all of the changes bound for
3.16 (i.e. the merge window changes). Once 3.15 is released, he will
presumably merge next to master and 
keep on merging from there. 
</p>

<p>
As he said in the <a href="/Articles/600984/">-rc8 release
announcement</a>, this part 
of the development cycle is typically fairly boring for Torvalds and the
rest of the kernel hackers.
Normally, Torvalds is "<q>just waiting around to make sure nothing bad is
happening</q>" for the last few weeks of each cycle.  If
this "experiment" works well, one—or even two—week overlaps between kernel
cycles could become a regular occurrence.  <i>That</i> could increase the
already 
frenetic pace of kernel development substantially.

<p>
As of this writing, Torvalds has pulled 5348 non-merge changes for 3.16
(and 54 into the mainline after the v3.15-rc8 tag).
Since we are in uncharted territory, it is a little hard to say for sure
when the merge window will close, but one could guess that it will before
he leaves on vacation, so an -rc1 on or about June&nbsp;15 seems just about
right.

Changes visible to kernel developers include:

<ul class="spacylist">

<li>The m68k architecture now has <tt>early_printk()</tt> support for more
platforms. 

<li>Lots of cleanup and refactoring has been done in the GPIO subsystem.

<li>Much work has gone into the <a href="/Articles/552904/">multiqueue
block layer</a>; "<q>3.16 will be a feature complete and performant
blk-mq</q>", Jens Axboe <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=next&id=681a2895486243a82547d8c9f53043eb54b53da0">said</a> in his pull request.  Multiqueue SCSI will

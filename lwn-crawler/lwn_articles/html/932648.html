<h1>Monitoring mount operations</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 24, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
Amir Goldstein kicked off a session on monitoring mounts at the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>.  In particular, there are problems
when trying to efficiently monitor "a very large number of mounts in a
mount namespace"; some user-space programs need an accurate view of the
mount tree without having to constantly parse <tt>/proc/mounts</tt> or the
like.  There 
are a number of questions to be answered, 
including what the API should look like and what entity should be watched
in order to get notifications of new 
mount operations.
</p>

<p>
It is trivial, he said, to add a notification for unmount events, but the
corresponding event for a new mount is trickier, since 
it is not clear where, exactly, the watch for that event should be placed.
It could be placed on the user or mount namespace of interest; another idea
would be to 
choose a directory and monitor all of the mounts that happen on it and any
of its subdirectories recursively.
David Howells said that he has implemented something for getting mount
notifications; the watch is placed on the mount namespace.  Miklos Szeredi
said that each namespace has its own mount tree and each mount has a 32-bit ID
that gets assigned to it, but those cannot reliably be used to uniquely
identify a particular mount because they can be reused during a given boot
of the 
system.  Howells said that he added a 64-bit counter that could be used for
that purpose, though it will
"eventually get reused" as well.
</p>

<p>
Howells was asked about patches, which he said he had <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/159645997768.1779777.8286723139418624756.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">posted</a>
a while back.  Szeredi pointed out that those patches were not for <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/filesystem-monitoring.html">fanotify</a>
support, but were instead for the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/watch_queue.html">watch queue</a>;
it is the same general concept, however, he said.  Christian Brauner
thought that the notification piece should be separated from the <a
href="/Articles/829212/"><tt>fsinfo()</tt> effort</a>.
</p>

<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
The problem, Howells said, is that the notification queue can overflow,
which means that events, such as mount and unmount operations, would get
lost.  Howells
mentioned that currently tools have to  parse (and poll)
<tt>/proc/mounts</tt> in order to find out the status of mounts and
unmounts, which is not particularly efficient.  Brauner noted that he had
invited Lennart Poettering to the talk, 
since systemd would be one of the eventual users of any new feature of this
sort, so he
asked Poettering about systemd's needs in this area.
</p>

<p>
Right now, systemd parses <tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt>, "which, of course,
is terrible", Poettering said.  He is not particularly concerned if events
get dropped, as long as there is a way to figure out what has happened;
some kind of unambiguous indication that events have been dropped coupled
with an API for systemd to get the current status when it needs to do so
would be ideal.  He would like a facility that provides the immediate child
mounts for a given mount along with mount-related events for those
children.  Howells said that Ian Kent had created a <a
href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2020-July/044914.html">patch
set implementing mount watching for systemd</a> using <tt>fsinfo()</tt> and
the watch queue notifications.
</p>

<p>
Brauner asked if the feature needed to be added to fanotify for systemd's
use, but 
Poettering said that he did not care.  His main concern is in getting
notified when events are lost, so that systemd can take some action to
update its state; it would be great if the lost-event notification narrowed down
where in the mount tree the lost event(s) came from.  For systemd's use
case, it would be better to get events for a particular subtree, rather
than the whole system, because it normally is only concerned with a subset
of the full mount tree.
</p>

<p>
Jeff Layton asked about the systemd use case for this information.
Poettering responded that there are many systemd services that need to wait for
mount activity of some form (e.g. at boot time, MySQL needs to wait for the
filesystem 
where its files reside).  Much of systemd's dependency processing for
services depends on an accurate picture of the state of the system,
including mounts.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein said that he was unsure how to report the occurrence of a <a
href="/Articles/927491/">tucked mount</a>, which is a mechanism aimed at
cleanly replacing an overlay mount.  Brauner said that he was no longer
"allowed to call it that"; there is another interpretation of that term,
which he was unaware of until "friendly people on social media" pointed it
out to him. They suggested using "beneath" to describe the type of mount.  There
is also, of course, the danger of mistyping the previous term, he said.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of a way to retrieve the immediate child mounts,
as Poettering requested, but that will require a unique mount ID, Brauner
said. After some roundabout discussion about mount-related APIs and the
concerns that would need to be kept in mind, worries about a mount-ID
overflow were raised.  Layton pointed out that a 64-bit counter that gets
incremented every nanosecond will take more than 500 years to overflow, so
"we're never going to overflow at 64 bits".  
</p>

<p>
There may be problems with
exposing those 64-bit values to user-space programs that expect only a 32-bit
mount-ID, however.  In fact, Poettering checked the systemd code and it
"knows" that the mount-IDs are 32-bits in size.  Howells said that the
existing mount-ID is "recycled, too small, people assume it is too small",
so something new that is defined to be 64-bits is needed. Poettering
suggested using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>s "and the problem goes away", he said, to chuckles
around the room.  As time expired, things kind of trailed off; it is clear
that there is more work needed before anything is likely to go upstream.

Depending on what kind of communities you hang out in, you might associate "tucking" primarily with drag queens or trans women hiding their genitals (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucking">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucking</a>). As far as I'm aware, there's no problem using that term in that context or in a Linux context - there's nothing negative or even confusing about it, since it's still just a kind of hiding something under something else. I presume the interaction on social media was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@brauner/110122901027222225">https://mastodon.social/@brauner/110122901027222225</a> in which it sounds like the commenter just thought it was a funny connotation.<br>

Given the absurd level of synonymal richness in the English language (check out the game "Synonymy") renaming this is stupid – esp. since we all know what "mount" can mean in the same context. Nobody's going to rename THAT.<br>

Yeah I personally think feeling like you are no longer allowed to call it that is a pretty strong overreaction too. I'm all for being careful in the language you chose and how it affects people, but there's not really any connotations or context that make the alternate meaning distasteful. I do understand that this sort of thing can be hard to judge for outsiders and they'd prefer to play it safe, but really the worst case is here really some trans people having a snicker at unintential comedy. Which, let's be real, will be happening anyway with all of the binders and eggs and make_trans() and thousands of other things overloaded in queer slang.<br>
<p>
That all said, given the difficulty of unlearning things I would understand if the author voluntarily preferred to name it something else now to avoid having that association in his head while working on the feature ;)<br>

Netlink has a similar problem with notifications overflowing the queue. The problem is that notifications are asychronous (and multicast); therefore blocking until the application has consumed them is not a workable solution. Blocking kernel waiting for a broken slow userspace application will bring even more pain.<br>
<p>
If queue overflows, then userspace application will see an error on the netlink listening socket.<br>
Handling overflow in a safe manner is really hard. The application can recover by rescanning the space it is listening to (ie all routes) but then synchronizing incoming changes with current state gets messy.<br>

Copy/account the memory of each message to each listener and let the OOM killer deal with any stuck ones?<br>

I think a potential problem with this might be that you would still have to allocate memory for the copied message. Even if the memory is shared between all processes that did not read the message yet, you would have to allocate new memory for the next message. So there would still be a way for the queue to be "full", but  the messages would have to be dropped for all listeners.<br>
I think a user space application could have a thread dedicated to listening to new messages and immediately copying them to another in-process queue for actual processing.<br>

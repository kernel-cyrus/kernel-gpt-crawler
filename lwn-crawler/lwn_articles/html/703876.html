Recipes</a>
</div>
Anybody working to harden a computing system is likely to look at
sandboxing fairly early in the process.  The prospect of vulnerabilities in
running software is a bit less worrisome if the scope for exploitation of
those vulnerabilities is limited, and a sandbox can limit an attacker's
freedom nicely.  The kernel has a number of mechanisms
that can support sandboxing now, and others are under development.  One of
those, the <a href="/Articles/700607/">Landlock security module</a>, was
the topic of <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/talks/seccomp-lsm-unprivileged-sandboxing/">Mickaël
Salaün's talk</a> at <a 
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/">Kernel Recipes 2016</a>.
<p>
The goal for Landlock, Salaün said, is to allow unprivileged users to
restrict processes that they run.  He is trying to create something that is
similar to the OpenBSD <tt>pledge()</tt> (<a
href="/Articles/651700/">formerly <tt>tame()</tt></a>) system call.  By
restricting 
what a running process can do, a Landlock-based sandbox can reduce the
attack surface of the kernel and, with luck, make the exploitation of
vulnerabilities harder in general.
<p>
Why not use the  mechanisms that the kernel already provides?  The
Linux security module (LSM) subsystem offers mechanisms like SELinux or
Smack, but those are meant for administrators, not users, Salaün said.
Their configuration is complex, and setting policies is a privileged
operation, which runs counter to the goal of working for unprivileged
users.  The <tt>seccomp()</tt> mechanism can be used to create sandboxes,
but it is limited; only 64 bits of information can be passed to a
<tt>seccomp()</tt> hook, and it is not possible to filter system calls

<a href="/Articles/703880/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/recipes/MickaëlSalaün-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Mickaël Salaün]" title="Mickaël Salaün" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

based on the paths of files they try to access.  The system-call level is
also the wrong place for this kind of filtering; the security hooks used by
the LSM subsystem are better placed for making proper access-control
decisions.
<p>
Thus, a new LSM.  It can be thought of as being similar to
<tt>seccomp()</tt>, in that it allows the loading of BPF programs to make
access-control decisions.  There are two aspects to that functionality that
are of interest.
<p>
The first is the ability to attach BPF programs directly to the LSM hook
functions and to give them access to the arguments passed to the hooks.  In
the current form of the patch set, the <tt>security_file_open()</tt>,
<tt>security_file_permission()</tt>, and <tt>security_mmap_file()</tt>
hooks can have programs attached to them; there are plans to add more hooks
in the future.
<p>
These hooks need the ability to make access-control decisions; in
particular, Salaün is looking for the ability to make path-based
decisions.  So, for example, a program might be blocked from accessing any
files outside of a dedicated, application-specific directory.  To support
this type of decision-making, a new type of BPF map
(<tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_LANDLOCK_ARRAY</tt>) is added.  These maps can hold
kernel pointers with an associated type; the actual use is to hold pointers
to <tt>file</tt> structures.  Then, there is a set of new BPF-callable
utility functions with convenient names like
<tt>bpf_landlock_cmp_fs_beneath_with_struct_file()</tt> that can tell a BPF
program whether one <tt>file</tt> structure is beneath another in the
filesystem hierarchy.
<p>
With that supporting structure in place, one can see how a Landlock-based
sandbox would work.  The control program populates a special map with the
file descriptors (converted to <tt>file</tt> structures internally) of the
directories that the sandboxed program is to be allowed to access.  A
simple BPF program, which is attached to the security hooks that are called when
files are opened, can then ensure that any file-access attempt is located
in or below one of 
the directories stored in the map.  Confining a process to specific parts
of the filesystem thus becomes relatively easy.
<p>
The last remaining piece is causing the relevant BPF programs to be run for
the process(es) in the sandbox.  There are two different ways in which that
can be done:
<P>
<ul>
<li> There is a new <tt>seccomp()</tt> operation, called
     <tt>SECCOMP_SET_LANDLOCK_HOOK</tt>, which will cause a program to be
     attached to a specific LSM hook for the current process.  It is
     possible to request that the program be invoked every time the
     equivalent LSM hook is called, but there is another possibility as
     well.  A normal <tt>seccomp()</tt> program can be attached to one or
     more system calls as usual, and Landlock can be told to only run the
     LSM-attached program if the <tt>seccomp()</tt> program returns the
     special <tt>SECCOMP_RET_LANDLOCK</tt> value.  The <tt>seccomp()</tt>
     program can, thus, make the access-control decision by itself, or it
     can decide to defer to the Landlock program(s) that will be invoked
     later. 
<p>
<li> Landlock programs can be attached to a control group, using an
     extension to the <a
     href="/Articles/698073/"><tt>bpf_prog_attach()</tt></a> patch.  In
     this case, every process running within that control group will be
     regulated by the Landlock programs.
</ul>
<p>
It is worth noting that the Landlock BPF programs are stackable in either
context; if multiple layers of programs are attached, each will run in
order and each will have the ability to veto any given operation.
<p>
Salaün demonstrated <a href="/Articles/703889/">a simple program</a> that
uses the Landlock hooks.  One 
need simply set the environment variable <tt>LANDLOCK_ALLOWED</tt> to a
list of directories that a program should be allowed to access, then use
the example program to launch the program of interest.  The sandboxed
program will be unable to access anything outside of the given list.
Attempts to access forbidden files are turned back with an <tt>EPERM</tt>
error; unlike <tt>seccomp()</tt>, Landlock does not kill programs that run
into access restrictions.
<p>
The response to the module thus far has been mostly positive.  Andy
Lutomirski is <a href="/Articles/703879/">concerned</a> about the
control-group mode, though, given that there are still outstanding
questions about how the version-2 control-group interface is going to work
in general.  So he recommends leaving that piece out and just using
<tt>seccomp()</tt> until that issue has been resolved.  The control-group
hook is a tiny piece of the whole, so, if leaving it out is the price of
admission for now, it is hard to imagine that anybody will be too upset.
<p>
One other potential problem is that there is a competing proposal out there
in the form of the <a href="/Articles/698843/">Checmate module</a>.  From
all appearances, though, Landlock is further along and more actively
developed.  It may make sense to take ideas from both projects, though;
Checmate is more focused on networking operations at the moment, which is
an area that Landlock has yet to address.  So the details are yet to be
determined, but it seems likely that there will be some sort of BPF-based
security module in the kernel before too long.  It has taken a while for
the stackable security modules concept to bring about a new set of
interesting security mechanisms, but that would appear to be happening at
last.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, if the BPF program doesn't need root to be attached, what's to stop an attacker just attaching a new BPF to get out of the sandbox once the sandboxed program is exploited?<br>

If it's anything like how seccomp-BPF works, then programs are indeed stackable, but each additional program can only serve to narrow permissions. And no, once a BPF program has been attached, it cannot be removed.<br>

      LSM hooks are purely restrictive - they can reduce access, but cannot increase it.  So, unless there's a bug somewhere, an attacker cannot escape by attaching more programs.

Firejail use Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. Landlock is a (low level) kernel feature similar to seccomp-bpf. Landlock should then be useful to sandbox managers like Firejail or any other software willing to do sandboxing (e.g. web browser).<br>

Using huge pages has been known for years to improve the performance of
many workloads.  But traditional huge pages, often sized by the CPU at 2MB,
can be difficult to allocate and can waste memory due to internal
fragmentation.  Driven by both the folio transition and hardware
improvements, attention to smaller, multi-size transparent huge pages
(mTHPs) has been on the rise.  In two memory-management-track sessions at
the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, developers discussed the
kernel's ability to reliably allocate mTHPs and the performance gains that
result.
<p>
<h4>Reliable mTHP allocation</h4>
<p>
The first session was presented remotely by Barry Song, who has been
working at Oppo to improve the availability of mTHPs on Android devices.
Large-folio support has been deployed on millions of these devices, he
said, but the chances of being able to allocate a large folio drop quickly
as memory fragments.  After one hour of operation, mTHP allocation attempts
succeed about 50% of the time, which is acceptable.  After two hours,
though, the failure rate exceeds 90%; memory is completely fragmented, and
mTHPs are simply no longer available.
<p>
Song ran some experiments with the TAO patches (which were discussed in <a
href="/Articles/974636/">the previous session</a>) applied.  The mTHP size
was set to order&nbsp;4 (64KB), and 15%&nbsp;of physical memory was
configured for mTHP-only allocations.  On that system, the success rate for
mTHP allocations remained stable at over&nbsp;50%.  Clearly there is
potential here, but Song has tried to push the work further.
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/21cnbao/mTHP/blob/main/largefoliosarch.png"><img

align="right"></a>

Specifically, he has implemented a system using two independent
least-recently-used (LRU) lists, one for base pages and one for large
folios.  There is a kernel thread dedicated to balancing the aging between
those two lists so that both types of pages remain available.  Reclaiming
large folios <i>as</i> large folios is important, he said; otherwise the
system can reclaim large numbers of smaller allocations and still never get
to the point where it can assemble a large folio.  A logical diagram of
this allocator can be seen on the right.
<p>
A key part of this design, he said, is the ability to keep a pool of large
folios in a special page block.  When they are not needed elsewhere in the
system, these folios can be lent out to drivers; the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/dma-buf.html">dma-buf</a>
and <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/mm/zsmalloc.html">zsmalloc</a>
subsystems can benefit from such loans.  This system also uses dual <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html">zram</a>
devices so that large and small folios can be swapped independently.
<p>
There was some inconclusive discussion at the end of the session; one gets
the sense that most developers are waiting to see the patches implementing
this solution.
<p>
<h4>Benchmarking mTHP performance</h4>
<p>
Work on increasing the reliability of mTHP allocation is based on the idea
that mTHPs improve performance.  As always, though, it is best to put such
notions to the test rather than simply assuming them.  In the following
session, Yang Shi discussed some benchmarking work he has done on 64-bit
Arm systems.
<p>
This work was not done on a mobile device; he used an Ampere Altra server
with 80&nbsp;CPU cores.  The tests were run on a 6.9-rc kernel, and
continuous-PTE support (a hardware feature that allows an entire mTHP to be
represented by a single translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entry) enabled.
The system ran with a range of base-page sizes, and huge pages were otherwise
disabled.  The benchmarks run used <a
href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>, <a
href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, kernel builds, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>, and other workloads.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/974836/"><img

With Memcached, using mTHPs resulted in an improvement of about 20% in the
number of operations completed per second, along with a 10-30% decrease in
latency, but only for larger base-page sizes.  That caused Jason Gunthorpe to
question the numbers; he wondered why running with 64KB mTHPs on a 4KB
base-page size showed no performance benefit.  Shi's answer was that the
extra overhead of maintaining the page tables at a 4KB page size
overwhelmed any benefit otherwise obtained.
<p>
The kernel-compilation numbers were similar, but the 64KB/4KB case showed a
5% performance benefit, which Shi attributed to a reduction in page faults.
Again, though, there were concerns in the room about the numbers, which did
not make sense to everybody.
<p>
Shi pressed through to his conclusions: he suggested that memory
allocations should start by attempting to get the largest possible mTHP
size; if that fails, the allocator should just fall back immediately to the
base-page size.  The performance benefits from allocating at the
intermediate sizes, he said, do not justify the additional work.  He also
suggested increasing the transparency of huge pages so that more
applications can make use of them without any special work.  There is no
need for special knobs to let applications specify the allocation sizes
they need, he concluded.
<p>
Gunthorpe disagreed, saying that the hugetlbfs mechanism works
<i>because</i> applications are aware and can obtain the sizes that they
need.  Control over allocation sizes has been exposed to user space for a
long time; applications have used it and shown that it is necessary.  He
mentioned an unnamed "certain application" that needs 2MB huge pages;
nothing else works well.  There is no reason to take away the ability to
request pages of that size.
<p>
Shi answered that hugetlbfs is a special feature, while the use of mTHPs is
meant to be transparent.  But David Hildenbrand said that the kernel is not
yet at the point where mTHPs can be used automatically.  The existing
transparent huge page feature has always been opt-in for a reason: memory
waste from internal fragmentation is a real problem.  Things work better if
applications can give hints for what they need.
<p>
Johannes Weiner agreed, saying that his group (at Meta) had enabled 2MB
huge pages for servers, but then immediately disabled them again.  Huge
pages can be good for performance, but they can't  be used everywhere.
Hildenbrand added that, someday, there will be an option to automatically
enable mTHPs, but that will not happen anytime soon.  And, at that point,
the session came to a close.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

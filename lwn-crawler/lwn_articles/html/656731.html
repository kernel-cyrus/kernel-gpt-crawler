<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 10, 2015</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, some 10,200 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository â€” 6,200 since <a href="/Articles/656267/">last
week's summary</a>.  The 4.3 development cycle thus looks to be a busy one,
even if it doesn't quite match the volume seen in 4.2.  Quite a few
interesting features have been pulled into the mainline over the last week.
<p>
First, though, a couple of items from last week deserve a followup mention:
<P>
<ul>
<li> As predicted, the <a href="/Articles/651645/">removal of the ext3
     filesystem</a> eventually went through.  Linus was worried about the
     effect of the removal on ext3 users, but was eventually <a
     href="/Articles/656819/">convinced</a> that 
     the ext4 maintainers will continue to support those users without
     forcing their filesystems forward to the ext4 format.
<p>
<li> The disabling of the VM86 feature described last week appears to have
     been a bit premature; some complaints have made it clear that it's a
     feature that would be missed.  So VM86 will likely come back before
     the 4.3 kernel is released.  Linus had <a href="/Articles/656820/">an
     interesting idea</a>, though: setting the <tt>mmap_min_addr</tt>
     parameter to a non-zero value effectively makes VM86 unusable for DOS
     emulation, so it would be reasonable to disable VM86 in that case.
     The kernel's default setting is 4,096, and most distributions use a
     value at least that high, so the end result would be
     to disable VM86 on the vast majority of systems where it cannot be
     used anyway. 
</ul>
<P>
Other interesting, user-visible activity in the last week includes:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/636226/">user-space page-fault handling patch
     set</a> has been merged at last.  The main use case for this feature
     is live migration of virtualized guests, but others probably exist as
     well.  See <a
     href="/Articles/656816/">Documentation/vm/userfaultfd.txt</a> for more
     information. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/632520/">ambient capabilities</a> work has been
     merged, changing the way capability inheritance is managed.  See <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/58319057b7847667f0c9585b9de0e8932b0fdb08">this
     commit message</a> for lots of details.
<p>
<li> Support for IPv6 is now built into the kernel by default.  Tom Herbert
     justified this change in <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/de551f2eb22a77a498cea9686f39e79f25329109">the
     changelog</a> by saying: "<q>IPv6 now has significant traction and
     any remaining vestiges of IPv6 not being provided parity with IPv4
     should be swept away. IPv6 is now core to the Internet and
     kernel.</q>"
<p>
<li> The networking layer now has "lightweight tunnel" support.  In
     <a href="/Articles/657074/">the networking pull request</a>, Dave
     Miller said: "<q>I've 
     heard rumblings that the lightweight tunnels infrastructure has been
     voted networking change of the year.  But what do I know?</q>"
     Indeed it may be a while before any of us know, since this feature
     appears to be quite thoroughly undocumented.  A bit of information
     does appear in <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/e69724f32e62502a6e686eae36b7aadfeea60dca">this
     merge commit</a>, though.
<p>
<li> Equally undocumented is the virtual routing domains feature, which
     allows the splitting of the kernel's routing tables into disjoint
     planes.  It appears to be a virtualization feature.  See <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/d52736e24fe2e927c26817256f8d1a3c8b5d51a0">the
     merge commit</a> for some information.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/657012/">identifier locator addressing</a>
     feature is aimed at communication within data centers where tasks can
     migrate from one machine to another.
<p>
<li> The <tt>discard_max_bytes</tt> parameter associated with block devices
     is now writable.  Administrators who are concerned about massive
     latencies caused by large discard operations can tweak this parameter
     downward, causing those operations to be split into smaller
     operations. 
<p>
<li> The Open vSwitch subsystem has gained a new module providing access to
     the kernel's network connection-tracking mechanism.
<p>
<li> The new "overflow scheduler" in the IP virtual server subsystem
     "<q>directs network connections to the server with the highest
     weight that is currently available and overflows to the next when
     active connections exceed the node's weight</q>"
<p>
<li> The MIPS architecture has gained support for the user-space probes (<a
     href="/Articles/499190/">uprobes</a>) mechanism.
<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>ptrace()</tt> operation
     (<tt>PTRACE_O_SUSPEND_SECCOMP</tt>) that can be used to suspend secure
     computing (seccomp) filtering.  This operation can only be invoked by
     a process with <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> in the initial namespace; it is
     intended to make it possible to checkpoint processes running in the
     seccomp mode.
<p>
<li> The Smack security module has gained the ability to associate labels
     with IPv6 addresses.
<p>
<li> The SELinux security module has a new ability to check
     <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls on a per-command basis.
<p>
<li> Audit rules can now target the actions of a process based on which
     executable it is running.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>

	  Qualcomm QDF2xxx pin controllers.
     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The handling of block I/O errors has been simplified.  There is a new
     <tt>bi_error</tt> field in <tt>struct bio</tt>; when something goes
     wrong an error code will be stored there.  The two older
     error-handling methods (clearing <tt>BIO_UPTODATE</tt> and passing
     errors to <tt>bi_end_io()</tt>) have been removed.
<p>
<li> The patch sets adding <a href="/Articles/651629/">atomic logic
     operations and relaxed atomic operations</a> have been merged.
<p>
<li> The static-key interface has changed in ways that, one hopes, will
     reduce the number of recurrent bugs caused by confusing naming in the
     previous API.  See <a
     href="/Articles/656808/">Documentation/static-keys.txt</a> for
     details.
<p>
<li> The ARM architecture has a new, software-implemented "privileged access
     never" mode that prevents kernel code from accessing user-space
     addresses.  With this mode enabled (the default), only accesses via
     the kernel's accessor functions will succeed.  ARM64 also supports
     this mode, but it's a direct hardware mode in this case.
<p>
<li> There are two new functions for the allocation and freeing of multiple
     objects from a slab cache:
<p>
<pre>
    bool kmem_cache_alloc_bulk(struct kmem_cache *cache, gfp_t gfp,
    	 		       size_t count, void **objects);
    void kmem_cache_free_bulk(struct kmem_cache *cache, size_t count,
    			      void **objects);
</pre>
<p>
     These functions are useful in performance-critical situations (<a
     href="/Articles/629155/">networking</a>, for example) where the fixed
     costs of allocation and freeing need to be amortized across a large
     number of objects.
<p>
<li> Module signing now uses the <a
     href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315">PKCS#7</a> message format.
     One change that results is that openssl-devel library (or equivalent)
     must be installed to build the kernel with signing enabled.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/653585/"><tt>memremap()</tt></a> mechanism for
     the remapping of device-hosted memory has been merged.  Also merged is
     the "<tt>struct page</tt> provider" patch set (described in <a
     href="/Articles/656197/">this article</a>) that creates <tt>page</tt>
     structures for nonvolatile memory as needed.
</ul>
<p>

The merge window is set to remain open through September 13, but the pace
has clearly slowed.  It is probably fair to say that we have seen the bulk
of the changes that will go into the 4.3 kernel.  That said, tune in next
week for a summary of any remaining changes that slip in before the merge
window closes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

User-space page-fault handling has a fairly significant performance cost attached to it, which would largely negate the benefit of transactional memory if it could be done that way.<br>

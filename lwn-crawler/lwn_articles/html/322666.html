<p>
There are quite a variety of <a href="/Articles/291091/">tracing options
for Linux</a>, with SystemTap being the most prominent, but that particular
solution has yet to become easily usable, at least partly due to its many
dependencies on user-space configuration and tools.  Another choice, which
originally came from work on 
realtime Linux, is ftrace.  Ftrace is a self-contained solution, requiring
no user-space tools or support, that is
useful for tracking down problems&mdash;not only in the kernel, but in its
interactions with user space as well. 
</p>

<p>
The name ftrace comes from "function tracer", which was its original
purpose, but it can do more than that.  Various additional tracers have
been added to look at things like context switches, how long interrupts are
disabled, how long it takes for high-priority tasks to run after they have
been woken up, and so on.  Its genesis in the realtime tree is evident in
the tracers so far available, but ftrace also includes a plugin framework
that allows new tracers to be added easily.
</p>

<p>
In a suitably configured kernel&mdash;one with <tt>CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER</tt>
enabled&mdash;accessing ftrace is done through the debug filesystem.
Typically, it is mounted this way:
<pre>
    # mount -t debugfs nodev /debug
</pre>
That creates a <tt>/debug/tracing</tt> subdirectory which is used to
control ftrace and for getting output from the tool.
</p>

<p>
One chooses a particular tracer to use by writing to
<tt>/debug/tracing/current_tracer</tt>&mdash;possibly after querying the
tracers 
available by reading <tt>/debug/tracing/available_tracers</tt>.  
On a recent Fedora rawhide kernel, checking the tracers available results
in:
<pre>
    # cat /debug/tracing/available_tracers
    power wakeup irqsoff function sysprof sched_switch initcall nop
</pre>

Tracing is
then enabled or disabled by writing to
<tt>/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled</tt>.  Using the function tracer would
be done as follows:
<pre>
    # echo function >/debug/tracing/current_tracer
    # echo 1 &gt;/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
    ...some commands or activity to trace...
    # echo 0 &gt;/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
</pre>
This produces a trace of each kernel function called, along with a
timestamp, which will allow a kernel hacker to see what is going on inside
the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Output from ftrace can be read from one of several files in the
<tt>tracing</tt> directory:
<ul>
<li><tt>trace</tt> - contains human-readable output of the trace
<p>
<li><tt>latency_trace</tt> - output from the same trace, but organized so
that system latency issues can be diagnosed, also in human-readable format
<p>
<li><tt>trace_pipe</tt> - contains the same output as <tt>trace</tt>, but
is meant to be piped into a command.  Unlike the other two, reading from
this file consumes the output.
</ul>
The ring buffer used by ftrace is a fixed size (governed by the
<tt>buffer_size_kb</tt> file), so <tt>trace</tt> or <tt>latency_trace</tt>
entries will eventually be overwritten.
</p>

<p>
Here are examples of the output from a function trace.  The header helps to
decode the various fields in the trace.  This is what the output from
<tt>trace</tt> looks like (heavily edited for brevity's sake):
<pre>
    # tracer: function
    #
    #           TASK-PID    CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
    #              | |       |          |         |
		bash-3330  [000]   147.799029: sys_open <-syscall_call
		bash-3330  [000]   147.799030: do_sys_open <-sys_open
		bash-3330  [000]   147.799030: getname <-do_sys_open
		bash-3330  [000]   147.799031: kmem_cache_alloc <-getname
</pre>
While this is <tt>latency_trace</tt> output (similarly edited):
<pre>
    # tracer: function
    #
    function latency trace v1.1.5 on 2.6.29-0.215.rc7.fc11.i586
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
     latency: 0 us, #120119/5425477, CPU#0 | (M:desktop VP:0, KP:0, SP:0 HP:0 #P:2)

    #                |||||     delay

	bash-3330    0.... 3531221us : sys_open (syscall_call)
	bash-3330    0.... 3531222us : do_sys_open (sys_open)
	bash-3330    0.... 3531222us : getname (do_sys_open)
	bash-3330    0.... 3531223us : kmem_cache_alloc (getname)
</pre>

Each line in the two output formats shows one function call, with one
level of backtrace, along with the process name, process id, and which CPU
the call 
was made on.  The <tt>latency_trace</tt> output also provides information
on whether interrupts have been disabled, whether a reschedule has been
called for, whether its running in an interrupt context, and whether
preemption has been disabled.  The timestamp for the <tt>latency_trace</tt>
output is relative to the start of the trace in microseconds; the
space after the time, and before the colon, is a field that gets set to either '!' or '+' to call
attention to especially long delays (in the example output it is always
blank).  Unfortunately, the header is a little misleading for where the "delay"
and "caller" fields point.
</p>

<p>
The sysctl <tt>kernel.ftrace_enabled</tt> governs whether function entry is
recorded as part of the trace.  It can be turned
on by using 
either of the following commands:
<pre>
    # sysctl kernel.ftrace_enabled=1 
    or 
    # echo 1 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
</pre>
Without that, many of the tracers are essentially pointless.
</p>


<p>
Half-a-dozen different tracers are described in the voluminous <a
href="/Articles/322731/"><tt>Documentation/ftrace.txt</tt></a> that comes
in the kernel source tree.  In addition to the function tracer, there is
the <tt>sched_switch</tt> tracer that tracks and reports on context
switches in the 
kernel, showing process wakeups along with when they get scheduled.  Each
trace entry has a timestamp along with the priorities and states of the
affected processes.  
</p>

<p>
The <tt>nop</tt> tracer is not a tracer at all, but can be used to clear
whatever tracer is currently active.
There are another seven tracers in the mainline
that have yet to make it into the documentation.  In addition, there are
even more tracers that are targeted for the 2.6.30 kernel.
</p>

<p>
There are four tracers that look for the
maximum time spent in a particular state, recording that maximum time
(in <tt>trace_max_latency</tt>) along with a trace of the functions called
during that state.  <tt>irqsoff</tt> looks for the longest time spent with
interrupts 
disabled, while <tt>preemptoff</tt> looks for the maximum time spent with
preemption turned off.  Combining the two gives the <tt>preemptirqsoff</tt>
tracer.  The final tracer, <tt>wakeup</tt> looks for the maximum latency
for the highest priority process to get scheduled after it has been woken up.
</p>

<p>
Each of those helps by reducing the amount of trace data that a kernel
hacker needs to wade through.  For kernels that are configured with
<tt>CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE</tt>, there is another way to filter the trace
data.  Dynamic ftrace allows the user to select kernel functions that are
either included or excluded from the tracing information collected.  The
<tt>available_filter_functions</tt> file lists the functions that can be
filtered, while writing function names to <tt>set_ftrace_filter</tt> or
<tt>set_ftrace_nofilter</tt> will include or exclude those functions.
Those lists can be appended to by using the standard <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
shell redirection operator.  In addition, there is support for wildcards so
that:
<pre>
    echo 'hrtimer_*' >/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
</pre>
will only gather tracing information from high-resolution timer functions.
</p>

<p>
Other tracers available in the mainline kernel (i.e. what will become
2.6.29) include:
<ul>
<li><tt>power</tt> - traces the CPU power state transitions
<p><li><tt>function_graph</tt> - similar to the function tracer, but traces
both function entry and exit, which allows a call graph to be generated
<p><li><tt>sysprof</tt> - periodically (governed by
<tt>sysprof_sample_period</tt>) generate stack traces for the running
process or kernel thread
<p><li><tt>initcall</tt> - traces the entry and exit of initialization
function calls during
system boot
<p><li><tt>branch</tt> - traces branch prediction and execution
<p><li><tt>hw-branch-tracer</tt> - uses the Branch Target Stack (BTS)
feature of x86 CPUs to trace branch execution
<p><li><tt>mmiotrace</tt> - traces memory-mapped I/O
</ul>

<p>
The production of human-readable output directly from the kernel recently
led to some hard <a href="/Articles/322780/">questions</a> from Andrew Morton:
"<q>Why on earth do we keep on putting all these pretty-printers and 
pretty-parsers into the kernel?  I mean, how hard is it for userspace
to read a text file, do some basic substitutions and print it out
again?</q>"  But, others argue that is precisely because of the ease of
getting a readable trace directly from the kernel which makes ftrace so
useful.  
</p>
<p>
Morton's <a href="/Articles/322782/">argument</a> is that the
fixed format is more difficult for 
scripts to parse and that the output is English-only.  He contends that
some kind of API would simplify things.  Pointing to the
<tt>latency_trace</tt> output as an example, he said:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] now you need to think about how this interface would have been
designed if we'd decided to access it with something smarter than
`cat'.
<p>
I mean, look at it.  All the multi-space column lining upping, the
unnecessary "us" annotation, the strange symbol(symbol) thing, etc. 
Plus it would have been more self-describing.  Right now, your parser
has to either assume that the second character of "0d..1" is
"irqs-off", or it has to learn how to follow ascii art lines.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Rather than needing some kind of user-space tool to interpret the ftrace
output, a kernel hacker can quickly get what they need from the kernel
itself.  As Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/322781/">pointed out</a>, there
may be no build environment available on the target machine, so having the
trace output available directly is useful: "<q>Self-sufficient kernel
instrumentation is a key concept to usability</q>".  Further, he said,
the output has been designed to be scriptable, but if that is not
sufficient, there are options to produce raw output.  Overall, he sees
kernel pretty-printing as a needed feature:
<div class="BigQuote">
IMO pretty-printing in the kernel should not be made a religious 
argument but a technical argument. Pretty-printing is a tool, 
and as a tool it sometimes can be used for silly purposes, and 
sometimes it can be used for helpful purposes. You seem to argue 
that doing it in the kernel is always silly - and i strongly 
disagree with that and consider it an extreme-end position - for 
the reasons outlined above.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The options that Molnar refers to are accessed via the
<tt>trace_options</tt> file, which lists the current options settings when read,
or it can be written to change options.  Three separate options: raw,
hex, and bin (along with several to determine which fields are included)
control the format of the output.  These can produce output in formats that
may be easier for some tools to use.  Not requiring <i>any</i> tool to get
a useful 
trace, though, is seen as a very important part of ftrace, at least by some.
</p>

<p>
There are lots more options and features of ftrace than are covered here.
The aforementioned <tt>ftrace.txt</tt> document is a good place to start
for those interested in more details.
</p>

<p>
Beyond those tracers already in the mainline, there are another handful
that are being readied for 2.6.30.  This includes a new event tracer, which
allow tracing various scheduling, locking, and interrupt handling events.
Continuous statistics gathering for workqueues and branch prediction is
included as well.
</p>

<p>
Ftrace is a useful tool that can provide excellent diagnostic information
from within a running kernel.  It is not a general-purpose tool, nor is it
geared to people unfamiliar with the innards of the kernel, but it
certainly has its uses.  There is quite a bit of activity going on with
ftrace these days, with numerous patches and enhancements floating around
on linux-kernel.  While it may not reduce Dtrace envy directly, it is a
tool that many kernel hackers are using today.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks, I was confused by what he meant by "Hype".<br>
<p>
But to his question about spurious directories in root. I still have on many systems an empty /opt. How's that different? I think seeing a /debug directory is quite obvious to what it is. Are you that worried about an inode that is seldom used?<br>
<p>
The only ones that ever complain about /debug are a few kernel developers that know that /sys/kernel/debug was made for that purpose. The majority of people that use ftrace seem to mount the debugfs on /debug.<br>
<p>
Typing "cat /debug/tracing/trace" is much faster than typing<br>
"cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace".<br>

I prefer /debug over /sys/kernel/debug/.  After all, this symbol only needs to be there for debugging, if present then it is unmistakable why it is there, and there is no real chance of collision.<br>

personally, i prefer to avoid "nodev" when possible as overuse can result in `mount` output that isnt completely obvious at first ... yes, that info is also available later on, but us english readers scan from left to right and get bored fairly quickly :)<br>
<p>
$ mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug<br>
$ mount | grep debugfs<br>
debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)<br>

Reading this over makes me wonder if the userspace-visible ABIs exposed by these tracers are fixed in stone.  Or are they intended to be only for kernel developers, users beware?<br>

They are not supposed to be fixed in stone, because they are in a debugfs<br>
namespace. But some care can be taken. For instance the sysprof tracer is<br>
used by a userspace program.<br>

I am trying to setup ftrace on a linux based android platform. I did the initial setups by enabling these below configs.<br>
<p>
CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_STACK_TRACER<br>
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE<br>
<p>
Built it and trying to see if it is working. But, I don't get any outputs from "trace". Inside the shell, I am trying the following. Can you please help find out what is missing to make it work?<br>
<p>
mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug/<br>
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/<br>
<p>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo function &gt; current_tracer<br>
echo function &gt; current_tracer<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; tracing_enabled<br>
echo 1 &gt; tracing_enabled<br>
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 &gt; tracing_on<br>

Solution:<br>
Tried multiple things and it was not working. Finally, got to know that removing "STRICT_MEMORY_RWX" Kernel config help solve the problem and I was able to do function tracing.<br>

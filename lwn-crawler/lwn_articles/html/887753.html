<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 14, 2022</br>
           </div>
When the kernel first gained support for
huge pages, most of the work was left to user space.  System administrators
had to <a href="/Articles/374424/">set 
aside memory in the special hugetlbfs filesystem</a> for huge pages, and
programs had to explicitly map memory from there.  Over time, the <a
href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge pages</a> mechanism automated the
task of using huge pages.  That mechanism is not perfect, though, and some
users feel that they have better knowledge of when huge-page use makes sense
for a given process.  Thus, huge pages are now coming full circle with <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20220308213417.1407042-1-zokeefe@google.com/">this patch
set</a> from Zach O'Keefe returning huge pages to user-space control.
<p>
Huge pages, of course, are the result of larger page sizes implemented by the CPU; the
specific page sizes available depend on the processor model and its
page-table layout.  An x86 processor will normally, for example, support
a "base" page size of 4KB, and huge pages of 2MB and 1GB.  Huge pages
dispense with the bottom layer (or layers) of the page-table hierarchy,
speeding the address-translation process slightly.  The biggest performance
advantage that comes from huge pages, though, results from the reduced
pressure on the processor's scarce translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
slots.  One 2MB huge page takes one TLB slot; when that memory is accessed as base pages,
instead, 512 slots are needed.  For some types of applications the speedup
can be significant, so there is value in using huge pages when possible.
<p>
That said, there are also costs associated with huge pages, starting with
the fact that they are huge.  Processes do not always need large, virtually
contiguous memory ranges, so placing all process memory in huge pages would
end up wasting a lot of memory.  The transparent huge pages mechanism tries
to find a balance by scanning process memory and finding the places where
huge pages might make sense; when such a place is found, a range of base
pages is "collapsed" into a single huge page without the owning process
being aware that anything has changed.
<p>
There are costs to transparent huge pages too, though.  The scanning itself
takes CPU time, so there are limits to how much memory the
<tt>khugepaged</tt> kernel thread is allowed to scan each second.  The
limit keeps the cost of <tt>khugepaged</tt> within reason, but also reduces
the rate at which huge pages are used, causing processes that could benefit
from them to run in a more inefficient mode for longer.
<p>
The idea behind O'Keefe's patch set is to allow user space to induce
huge-page collapse to happen quickly in places where it is known (or hoped)
that use of huge pages will be beneficial.  The idea was first <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/d098c392-273a-36a4-1a29-59731cdf5d3d@google.com/">suggested
by David Rientjes</a> in early 2021, and eventually implemented by O'Keefe.
Beyond allowing huge-page collapse to happen sooner, O'Keefe says, this work
causes the CPU time necessary for huge-page collapse to be charged to
the process that requests it, increasing fairness.
<p>

It also allows the process to control when that work is done.  Data stored
in base pages will be scattered throughout physical memory; collapsing
those pages into a huge page requires copying the data into a single,
physically contiguous, huge page.  This, in turn, requires blocking changes
to those pages during the copy and uses CPU time, all of which can increase
latency, so there is value in being able to control when that work happens.

<p>
A process can request huge-page collapse for a range of memory with a new
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
request:
<p>
<pre>
    int madvise(void *begin, size_t length, MADV_COLLAPSE);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attempt to collapse <tt>length</tt> bytes of memory
beginning at <tt>begin</tt> into huge pages.  There does not appear to be
any specific alignment requirement for those parameters, even though huge
pages <i>do</i> have alignment requirements.  If
<tt>begin</tt> points to a base page in the middle of the address range
that the huge page containing it will cover, then
pages before <tt>begin</tt> will become part of the result.  In other
words, <tt>begin</tt> will be aligned backward to the proper beginning
address for the containing huge page.
The same is
true for <tt>length</tt>, which will be increased if necessary to encompass
a full huge page.
<p>
There are, of course, no guarantees that this
call will succeed in creating huge pages; that depends on a number of
things, including the availability of free huge pages in the system.  Even
if the operation is successful, a vindictive kernel could split the huge
page(s) apart again before the call returns.  If at least some success was
had, the return code will be zero; otherwise an error code will be
returned.  A lack of available huge pages, in particular, will yield an
<tt>EAGAIN</tt> error code.
<p>
Support for <tt>MADV_COLLAPSE</tt> is also added to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_madvise.2.html"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>,
allowing one process to induce huge-page collapse in another.  In this
case, there are a couple of flags that are available (these would be the
first use of the <tt>flags</tt> argument to <tt>process_madvise()</tt>):
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>MADV_F_COLLAPSE_LIMITS</tt> controls whether this operation should
     be bound by the limits on huge-page collapse that <tt>khugepaged</tt>
     follows; these are set via sysctl knobs in existing kernels.  If the
     calling process lacks the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability, then the
     presence of this flag is mandatory.  It is arguably a bit strange to
     require an explicit flag to request the default behavior, but that's
     the way of it.
<li> <tt>MADV_F_COLLAPSE_DEFRAG</tt>, if present, allows the operation to
     force page compaction to create free huge pages, even if the system
     configuration would otherwise not allow that.  This flag does not
     require any additional capabilities, perhaps because the cost of
     compaction would be borne by the affected process itself.
</ul>
<p>
The end result, O'Keefe says, is a mechanism that allows user space to take
control of the use of huge pages, perhaps to the point that the kernel need
no longer be involved:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Though not required to justify this series, hugepage management
	could be offloaded entirely to a sufficiently informed userspace
	agent, supplanting the need for khugepaged in the kernel.
</blockquote>
<p>
First, though, this work would need to make it into the mainline kernel.
Most of the review comments thus far are focused on details, but David
Hildenbrand did <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/30571216-5a6a-7a11-3b2c-77d914025f6d@redhat.com/">take
exception</a> to one aspect of this new operation's behavior.  In the
current patch series, huge pages will be created for any virtual memory area, even those
that have been explicitly marked to <i>not</i> use huge pages with an
<tt>madvise(MADV_NOHUGEPAGE)</tt> call.  That, he said, "<q>would break
KVM horribly</q>" on the s390 architecture.  This behavior will thus
need to change.
<p>
The current patch set only works with anonymous pages; the plan is to add
support for file-backed pages at a later time.  Since one of the stated
justifications for this patch is to be able to quickly enable huge pages for
executable text, support for file-backed pages seems important, and the
developers are likely to want to see it before giving this work the
go-ahead.  The feature looks like it will be useful for some use cases,
though, so it seems likely to find its way into the mainline sooner or
later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I suppose it&#x27;s the difference between a solid object collapsing into individual pieces, like a wall collapsing into a disconnected pile of bricks; or a sparsely connected group of elements collapsing into a single mass, like a house of cards collapsing into a dense pile of cards.<br>

Think of the energy. It takes an release of energy to make things explode, a minimal flow of energy to make things collapse, while an implosion gives of a blast of energy.<br>
<p>
So I guess collapse is the right word here. There&#x27;s a minimal change observable from outside the system, while what was there is still there, just looking a lot smaller because all the empty space has been squeezed out.<br>

Both are true. Some programs are perfectly happy with a lot of small, non-contiguous virtual memory ranges because they never do large allocations. <br>

aggregate, rather than &quot;collapse&quot; might be a better word.<br>

The most apt English word is &quot;consolidate&quot;.<br>

(That did not stop business reporters from preferring &quot;conglomerate&quot;, some decades back.)<br>

I thought about &quot;coalesce&quot;, but &quot;collapse&quot; is just what the operation is ubiquitously referred to in the kernel and existing apis (e.g. /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/pages_collapsed) and stats (e.g. /proc/vmstat:thp_collapse_alloc[_failed]).<br>

Thanks for the kind writeup! :)<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; This call will attempt to collapse length bytes of memory beginning at begin into huge pages. There does not appear to be any specific alignment requirement for those parameters, even though huge pages do have alignment requirements.</font><br>
<p>
I should call out what happens when parameters are passed that don&#x27;t align with architecture hugepage size/alignment; thanks for pointing out that I didn&#x27;t mention this anywhere.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If begin points to a base page in the middle of the address range that the huge page containing it will cover, then pages before begin will become part of the result. In other words, begin will be aligned backward to the proper beginning address for the containing huge page. The same is true for length, which will be increased if necessary to encompass a full huge page.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
A small correction: the opposite actually happens; we forward align the start and backward align the end. Else, we&#x27;d have to make a decision on what to do if the new range fell outside the VMA(s). IOW, we clamp the provided range(s) to be hugepage aligned/sized.<br>

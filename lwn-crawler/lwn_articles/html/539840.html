<p>
The ARM big.LITTLE architecture has been the subject of a number of
<a href="/Articles/481055/">LWN articles</a> (here's <a
href="/Articles/501501/">another</a>) and <a 
href="/Articles/514063/">conference talks</a>, as well as a fair amount of
code.  A number of upcoming systems-on-chip (SoCs) will be using the
architecture, so some kind of near-term solution for Linux support is
needed.  Linaro's Mathieu Poirier came to the 2013 <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference/">Embedded
Linux Conference</a> to describe that interim solution: the in-kernel switcher.
</p>

<h4>Two kinds of CPUs</h4>

<p>
Big.LITTLE incorporates architecturally similar CPUs that have different
power and performance characteristics.  The similarity must consist of a
one-to-one mapping between instruction sets on the two CPUs, so that code
can "migrate seamlessly", Poirier said.
Identical CPUs are grouped into clusters.</p>

</a>

<p>
The SoC he has been using
for testing consists of three Cortex-A7 CPUs (LITTLE: less performance,
less power consumption) in one cluster and two
Cortex-A15s (big) in the other.  The SoC was deliberately chosen to have a different number
of processors in the clusters as a kind of worst case to catch any problems
that might arise from the asymmetry.  Normally, one would want the same
number of processors in each cluster, he said.
</p>

<p>
The clusters are connected with a cache-coherent interconnect, which can
snoop the cache to keep it coherent between clusters.  There is an
interrupt controller on the SoC that can route any interrupt from or to any
CPU. In addition, there is support in the SoC for I/O coherency that can be
used to keep 
GPUs or other external processors cache-coherent, but that isn't needed for
Linaro's tests.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind big.LITTLE is to provide a balance between power
consumption and performance.  The first idea was to run CPU-hungry tasks on
the A15s, and less hungry tasks on the A7s.  Unfortunately, it is "hard to
predict the future", Poirier said, which made it difficult to make the
right decisions because there is no way to know what tasks are CPU
intensive ahead of time.
</p>

<h4>Two big.LITTLE approaches</h4>

<p>
That led Linaro to a two-pronged approach to solving the problem:
Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP) and the In-Kernel Switcher (IKS).
The two projects are running in parallel and are both in the same kernel
tree.  Not only that, but you can enable either on the kernel command line
or switch at run time via sysfs.
</p>

<p>
With HMP, all of the cores in the SoC can be used at the same time, but the
scheduler needs to be aware of the capabilities of the different processors
to make its decisions.  It will lead to higher peak performance for some
workloads, Poirier said.  HMP is being developed in the open, and anyone
can participate, which means it will take somewhat longer before it is
ready, he said.
</p>

<p>
IKS is meant to provide a "solution for now", he said, one that can be used
to build products with.  The basic idea is that one A7 and one A15 are
coupled into a single virtual CPU.  Each virtual CPU in the system will
then have the same capabilities, thus isolating the core kernel from the
asymmetry of big.LITTLE.  That means much less code needs to change.
</p>

<p>
Only one of the two processors in a virtual CPU is active at any given
time, so the decision on which of the two to use can be made at the CPU
frequency (cpufreq) driver level.  IKS was released to Linaro members in
December 2012, and is "providing pretty good results", Poirier said.
</p>

<p>
An alternate way to group the processors would be to put all the A15s
together and all the A7s into another group.  That turned out to be too
coarse as it was "all or nothing" in terms of power and performance.  There
was also a longer synchronization 
period needed when switching between those groups.  Instead, it made more sense
to integrate "vertically", pairing A7s with A15s.
</p>

<p>
For the test SoC, the "extra" A7 was powered off, leaving two virtual CPUs
to use.  The processors are numbered (A15_0, A15_1, A7_0, A7_1) and then
paired up (i.e. {A15_0, A7_0}) into virtual CPUs; "it's not rocket
science", Poirier said.  One processor in each
group is turned off, but only the cpufreq driver and the switching logic
need to know that there are more physical processors than virtual processors.
</p>

<p>
The virtual CPU presents a list of operating frequencies that encompass the
range of frequencies that both A7 and A15 can operate at.  While the
numbers look like frequencies (ranging from 175MHz to 1200MHz in the
example he gave), they don't really need to be as they are essentially just
indexes 
into a 
table in the cpufreq driver.  The driver maps those values to a real
operating point 
for one of the two processors.
</p>

<h4>Switching CPUs</h4>

<p>
The cpufreq core is not aware of the big.LITTLE architecture, so the driver
does a good bit of work, Poirier said, but the code for making the
switching decision is simple.  If the requested frequency can't be
supported by the current processor, switch to the other.  That part is
eight lines of code, he said.
</p>

<p>
For example, if virtual CPU&nbsp;0 is running on the A7 at 200MHz and a request
comes in to go to 1.2GHz, the driver recognizes that the A7 cannot support
that. In that case, it decides to power down the A7 (which is called the
outbound processor) and power up the A15 (inbound).  
There is a synchronization process that happens as part of the transition so
that the inbound 
processor can use the existing cache.
That process is
described in Poirier's <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/images/stories/slides/elc2013_poirier.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>, starting at slide 17.
</p>

<p>
The outbound processor powers up the inbound and continues executing normal
kernel/user-space code until
it receives the "inbound alive" signal.  After sending that signal, the
inbound processor initializes both the cluster and interconnect if it is
the first 
in its cluster (i.e. the other processor of the same type, in the other
virtual CPU is powered down).  It then waits for a signal from the outbound processor.
</p>

<p>
Once the outbound processor receives "inbound alive" signal, the blackout period
(i.e. time when no kernel or user code is running on the virtual CPU)
begins.  The outbound processor
disables interrupts, migrates the interrupt signals to the inbound
processor, then saves the current CPU context.  Once that's done, it
signals the inbound processor, which restores the context, enables
interrupts, and continues executing from where the outbound processor left
off.  All of that is possible because the
instruction sets of the 
two processors are identical.
</p>

<p>
As part of its cleanup, the outbound processor creates a new stack for
itself so that it won't interfere with the inbound.  It then flushes the
local cache and checks to see if it is the last one standing in its
cluster; if so, it flushes the cluster cache and disables the
cache-coherent interconnect.  It then
powers itself off. 
</p>

<p>
There are some pieces missing from the picture that he painted, Poirier
said, including <a href="/Articles/539082/">"vlocks" and other mutual
exclusion mechanisms</a> to handle simultaneous desired cluster power
states. Also missing was discussion of the "early poke" mechanism as well
as code needed to track the CPU and cluster states.
</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>
One of Linaro's main targets is Android, so it used the interactive power
governor for its testing.  Any governor will work, he said, but will need
to be tweaked. 
A second threshold (<tt>hispeed_freq2</tt>) was added to the interactive
governor to delay going into "overdrive" on the A15 too quickly as those
are "very power hungry" states. 
</p>

<p>
For testing, BBench was used.  It gives a performance score based on how
fast web pages are loaded.  That was run with audio playing in the
background.  The goal was to get 90% of the performance of two A15s, while
using 60% of the power, which was achieved.  Different governor parameters
gave 95% 
performance with 65% of the power consumption. 
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that tuning is definitely required&mdash;without it you
can do worse than the performance of two A7s.  "If you don't tune, all
efforts are wasted", Poirier said.  The interactive governor has 15-20
variables, but Linaro mainly concentrated on <tt>hispeed_load</tt> and
<tt>hispeed_freq</tt> (and the corresponding <tt>*2</tt> parameters added
for handling 
overdrive). The basic configuration had the virtual CPU run on the A7 until
the load reached 85%, when it would switch to the first six
(i.e. non-overdrive) frequencies on the A15.  After 95% load, it would use
the two overdrive frequencies.
</p>

<p>
The upstreaming process has started, with the cluster power management code
getting "positive remarks" on the ARM Linux mailing list.  The goal is to
upstream the code entirely, though some parts of it are only available to
Linaro members at the moment.  The missing source will be made public once
a member ships a product using IKS.  But, IKS is "just a stepping stone",
Poirier said, and "HMP will blow this out of the water".  It may take a
while before HMP is ready, though, so IKS will be available in the meantime.

i had a look at Poirier's slides and on slide 13 i don't understand why Cortex A7 frequency range is 350MHz to 1GHz and for virtual Core those frequencies become 175MHz to 500 MHz.<br>
<p>
Same thing on slide 14 it is said "Virtual OPPs for the A7 core are half of the effective ones"<br>
<p>
Is there any reason for that division by two ? is it valid for any big.LITTLE implementation ?<br>

<p>
The goal is to try to map the performance of the cores into a comparable measurement.  They're estimating that an A7 at a real clock frequency of 1000 MHz matches the performance of an A15 at a real clock frequency of 500 MHz, and choosing to call that performance point "500 MHz".<br>

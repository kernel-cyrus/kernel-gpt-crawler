<p>When developing the Linux kernel (be it core components or drivers), it
is the
tasks 
of deploying, testing, and debugging that represent a large portion of the
work—if 
not the most time-consuming part. At <a href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/">Kernel Recipes 2015</a>, Stefan
Hajnoczi gave a talk about the <a href="http://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>
hardware emulator and explained how it can help speed up the 
process. For example, QEMU's GDB stub provides an efficient way to debug the
kernel, while QEMU's device emulation facilitates the development and
testing of device drivers.</p> 

<h4>Why QEMU?</h4>

<p>Hajnoczi started his presentation by comparing ways to deploy and test Linux
kernels.</p>

<a href="/Articles/660449/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/kr-hajnoczi-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Stefan Hajnoczi]" title="Stefan Hajnoczi" width=214 height=300>
</a>

<p>He first presented the "<i>in situ</i>" debugging approach, where the kernel
is 
deployed and tested directly on the development machine. An example of this
would be loading a module under development directly into the kernel that the
computer is running. There are two dimensions to considering such an approach.
As one can imagine, an unstable or broken module can crash the machine and
result in lost work. Furthermore, such a crash seriously disrupts the
development 
workflow, because the computer has to reboot and the session must be restored.
The second dimension concerns debugging the kernel; as Hajnoczi pointed out:
"KGDB and Kdump cannot be 100% reliable since they share the environment" (i.e.
because they are part of the potentially broken system).</p>

<p>The "<i>ex situ</i>" debugging approach requires an additional machine. In a way, he
argued, it is better than the previous approach because the test machine can
crash without bringing down the development environment with it.  However,
deploying the kernel and running tests is more cumbersome. In the most commonly
encountered setup, the test machine boots over the network via PXE (Pre-boot eXecution
Environment). Right after being powered on, the
test machine obtains an IP address via DHCP from a PXE server and downloads the
binary image it is supposed to boot using TFTP (Trivial FTP). It thus
involves this special PXE environment to be installed and set up, most likely on
the development machine, which is not necessarily easy.

<p>
In terms of debugging,
it is possible to connect the development machine to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kgdb/EnableKGDB.html">KGDB</a>
infrastructure of the kernel running on the test machine via a serial
connection. Collecting <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt">crash dumps</a> from the test machine and examining
them later on the development machine is also possible. However, these software
tools cannot inspect and debug everything, especially when it comes to the
interaction between the kernel and the various hardware components (or to debug
the early boot code that runs before KGDB is up and running). In such
cases, debugging may 
require complex on-chip instrumentation, such as JTAG. It is also
worth mentioning that a test machine is another computer to take care of and
probably not one that travels well, making this type of debugging even less
practical.</p> 

<p>As Hajnoczi noted, "virtual machines are the best
of both 
worlds." Since a virtual machine is a user-space application running on the
development machine, it is easy to start and stop, and if ever the kernel
running in it crashes, the development machine will not be affected. A virtual
machine gives full access to the memory and processor state, and it is much
more versatile than a test machine since it can emulate different processor
architectures. Furthermore, the hardware in the virtual machine is fully
programmable, which provides 
ways to easily add new or custom devices and to extensively test the
corresponding 
software (e.g.  device drivers) by using error-injection techniques.</p>

<h4>Overview of QEMU</h4>

<p>QEMU is a machine emulator and virtualizer. It can emulate obscure
processor architectures as well as more mainstream ones (a total of 17 processor
architectures are currently supported). When used as a machine emulator,
typically in a cross-architecture setup (e.g. emulating an ARM-based guest
system on an x86 host computer), QEMU dynamically translates the guest code into
native code for fast execution on the host. When the guest and the host share
the same architecture, QEMU is often able to provide near-native
performance by using KVM, which allows the guest code to run directly and safely
on the host processor without being translated first.</p>

<p>In order to provide guest access to the hardware (e.g. devices), QEMU
usually catches the 
accesses from the guest and performs them on the host on behalf of the guest.
For example, guest access to a hard disk can typically be emulated
by reading or writing a file on the host computer that contains a full filesystem. For better performance, it is also possible to create a PCI
or VGA
pass-through, using the <a href="/Articles/474088/">VFIO kernel support</a>. The guest is then able to
directly access real hardware devices without emulation. QEMU provides the
ability to trace the I/O accesses in order to debug the communications between
the guest and the hardware.</p>

<h4>Booting and testing</h4>

<p>The command line parameters for QEMU resemble those of a bootloader, making them
easy to understand. For example, the following command starts a development
kernel on an x86-64 guest, specifying the paths to the kernel and the
initramfs image. It also shows how to append an extra kernel parameter:</p>

<pre>
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
	-kernel vmlinuz \
	-initrd initramfs.img \
	-append param1=value1
</pre>

<p>When testing a development kernel, there is often no need for a full-featured
root filesystem and, as Hajnoczi explained, initramfs is perfect for
containing small test applications and loadable kernel modules. An initramfs
image is built using <tt>gen_init_cpio</tt>, a tool already included in the
Linux 
source tree. The content of such an image is specified by a simple description
file that defines which files, directories, device nodes, and symbolic
links should be part of the 
filesystem image. The following example shows how to build a basic initramfs
image:</p>

<pre>
    $ cat initramfs_desc
    file    /init           my-init.sh    0755 0 0
    dir     /bin                          0755 0 0
    nod     /dev/zero                     0666 0 0 c 1 5
    file    /sbin/busybox   /sbin/busybox 0755 0 0
    slink   /bin/sh         /sbin/busybox 0755 0 0

    $ gen_init_cpio initramfs_desc | gzip &gt; initramfs.img
</pre>

<p>For this kind of initramfs image, the tests would be kicked off directly from
the <tt>/init</tt> executable, which is the first user process launched
by the kernel after 
booting.  Here, the image uses <a
href="http://www.busybox.net/">BusyBox</a>, which is a simple toolbox 
application 
that provides a large set of basic commands (such as a shell) and thus lowers
the complexity of building this initial root filesystem image. Finally, Hajnoczi
added, the initramfs can even be inserted into the kernel image, making the
deployment even easier.</p>

<a href="/Articles/660450/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/kr-hajnoczi-char-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"
alt="[Stefan Hajnoczi caricature]" title="Stefan Hajnoczi caricature" width=207 height=300>
</a>

<p>For efficient testing, he mentioned the <tt>-nographic</tt> option of QEMU.
Using that and instructing the kernel to use the serial port
(<tt>console=ttyS0</tt>), will disable QEMU's GUI and use the serial
connection as the
main channel for displaying text and reading input. The output is then displayed
in the host terminal from which QEMU was launched, thus enabling the
possibility to run tests from automated scripts since the output can be
processed with tools like <tt>grep</tt>.</p>

<p>Some challenges associated with manually building an initramfs can sometimes
necessitate using a persistent root filesystem instead. When the virtual
machine is compatible with the host, the initramfs image can be directly
populated with files from the host operating system (applications and libraries)
because they are compatible. That convenient approach can get more
difficult if many of the applications added into the image are dynamically
linked, because all of the shared library dependencies must be found with
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html"><tt>ldd</tt></a> and manually added, which can end up being a lot of work.</p>

<p>Hajnoczi listed two options for providing persistent root
filesystems. The guest 
can either share a directory with the host, using virtfs or NFS, or it can use a
disk image file containing a partition table and one or multiple filesystems.
While the shared directory is easy to manipulate and to inspect from the host,
the disk image file offers the ability to easily install a full Linux
distribution.</p>

<h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>Through the activation of a GDB stub in QEMU (with the <tt>-s</tt>
option), a virtual machine 
can be connected to a GDB client on the host and can be debugged in an
efficient and, 
most importantly, non-intrusive way. This stub provides the client with 
access to 
inspect the processor registers and the memory, as well as to set breakpoints on
the kernel code executed in the virtual machine.</p>

<p>Hajnoczi stressed the fact that this kind of remote debugging is not the same
as debugging QEMU itself; the two are often confused. While QEMU's GDB stub
helps debugging what the virtual machine sees, running GDB directly against QEMU
is only for debugging the hardware device emulation or QEMU internals.</p>

<p>He also pointed out a few things to remember regarding remote debugging. First,
it is necessary to inform GDB as to which specific architecture or
sub-architecture is being used in the virtual machine, otherwise GDB has no way
of knowing. But more importantly, since the GDB stub is integrated into the
processor model, it always follows the same view of the memory as the processor.
When the processor is running in the physical address space (e.g. when Linux is
booting and before switching to virtual memory), GDB can see and access the
entire memory. But as soon as the virtual memory is enabled, GDB can only access
what the processor can access, which is what is mapped through the current page
tables. Another effect is that GDB cannot properly differentiate between the
kernel and user applications because they all appear like a single execution
flow. GDB is thus not able to interpret higher-level abstractions and does not
know much about the current user-space process or any swapped-out pages.</p>

<h4>Device bring-up</h4>

<p>There are several challenges for driver developers, Hajnoczi said. Sometimes the
real hardware is not available yet, or is expensive to obtain. Both cases
make it difficult to develop the corresponding software support. Other times,
hardware and software are supposed to be co-developed in parallel in order to
minimize the time to market.</p>

<p>These challenges can be overcome by implementing device emulation in QEMU and
developing the corresponding driver against the emulated device. Such software
support can later be verified using the real hardware when the device is
finally available. As an audience member noted, though, it is nonetheless
advised to be 
cautious because QEMU is not a cycle-accurate emulator. Since it does not
respect the timing of the real hardware, a device driver may work fine with the
emulated version of the device but not with the real one.</p>

<p>Hajnoczi gave a few examples in which device bring-up in QEMU had
successfully 
been used: the Rocker OpenFlow network switch, the NVMe PCI flash storage
controller, and NVDIMM persistent memory devices.</p>

<p>A large base of existing code greatly helps the development of new devices. QEMU
supports common buses (e.g. PCI, USB, I2C) and, in a way that is comparable to
Linux, provides the notion of device classes (e.g. device, device-pci) from
which devices can inherit. Memory-mapped (and port-mapped) devices are
implemented through a memory API, which
registers a device's memory segments and binds them to functions that
describe the behavior of the device—thus emulating it. QEMU also provides
bus-specific methods to raise interrupts, in addition to emulating interrupt
controllers.</p>

<p>As Hajnoczi mentioned, the documentation for implementing device
emulation in QEMU is unfortunately sparse, but there are plenty of examples
in the QEMU source
available to learn from.</p>

<h4>Error injection</h4>

<p>When developing a driver for a device, it is often difficult to exercise rare
code paths. For example, how can the behavior of the driver be verified
when hot unplugging the corresponding device while it is in use? Such events are
actually difficult to produce with real devices, without having to reach into a
box to pull out cables and potentially cause damage. With device emulation,
QEMU is able to easily simulate those error conditions in a safe manner.</p>

<p>For some devices, an advanced error-injection engine is even available.
Hajnoczi gave the example of the block I/O layer that can accept error-injection
scripts based on state machines. As shown in the snippet below, such a script
can fail all the disk reads after a first write, for example:</p>

<pre>
    [set-state]
    state = "1"
    event = "write_aio"
    new_state = "2"

    [inject-error]
    state = "2"
    event = "read_aio"
    errno = "5"
</pre>

<p>In the first state, named "set-state", the error-injection script is waiting for
the event named "write_aio" to occur. Such an event corresponds to a disk write
and will make the state machine jump to the second state, named "inject-error".
From there, all the events corresponding to disk reads ("read_aio")
will fail with <tt>EIO</tt> (which is 5). More information can be found in a <a
href="http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=docs/blkdebug.txt;h=b67a36d5c6694331c2e88f86c2515914b6d38500;hb=HEAD">document</a>
that gives an overview of the features available in
the block I/O error-injection engine.</p>

<h4>About Kernel Recipes</h4>

<p>
This is the fourth edition of Kernel Recipes, which is definitely becoming
 a popular annual rendezvous in France for Linux enthusiasts. It had many 
well-known <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/speakers/">speakers</a> from the
community. Greg Kroah-Hartman, for example, 
performed the release of the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?h=linux-3.14.y">3.14.54  
longterm kernel</a> on stage. This year's edition also had an artist
drawing caricatures of the speakers; the one for Hajnoczi can be seen
above. The slides (and soon videos) of 
all the talks given at the conference are available on the  
<a href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/schedule/">web site</a>.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Shameless plug:<br>

<p>
There's a virtme-configkernel, too.  There's also decent cross-arch support.  x86, arm, aarch64, and s390x are known to work at least a bit (using QEMU TCG, not KVM, unless you happen to have one of those as your host).  You can load Xen in virtme, too, if you have an appropriately patched kernel (which is a big mess for upstream because of crazy virtio design issues).<br>
<p>
You can find it at <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/kernel/virtme/virtme.git/">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/kernel/virtme/virtme.git/</a>, and there's also a Fedora package.<br>
<p>
The 'wait a couple seconds' part is mostly the fault of a kbd bug, which is fixed upstream and should trickle into to distros soon.<br>

Meant to do this a while ago but got distracted: I created a small AUR package for the git HEAD. I heard some kernel developers use Arch Linux, so for the people who prefer to do all their package management with their distribution's package manager instead of pip etc., can save the ~5 minutes I needed to create this: <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/virtme-git/">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/virtme-git/</a><br>
<p>
I thought creating a "stable" package with only the tagged release versions was a waste of effort, since the last release appears to be ancient, and with a very developer-focused tool like this, people won't miss it anyway.<br>
<p>
Either way, very interesting project, thanks for sharing!<br>

Maybe not the right place for it, but I'll try anyway :-)<br>
<p>
I'm trying to port OpenWRT to a ZTE router, which is MIPS-based. I've been trying to use qemu to debug some of the functionality provided in the vendor kernel (and userspace), but have found it difficult to figure out exactly how to try to boot the vendor image. I have taken a copy of the flash chip, and its various partitions (available here: <a href="http://dawes.za.net/rogan/zte_mtdblock0">http://dawes.za.net/rogan/zte_mtdblock0</a>), can anyone give me a hint on how to invoke an instance of qemu-mips that will attempt to run the bootloader, etc?<br>

It's unlikely to work. Most bootloaders and vendor kernels depend on board-specific hardware configuration that can't be emulated by qemu.<br>
<p>
However, you can use it to debug userspace binaries.<br>

Fair enough, I get that the bootloader may be a problem. You'd think that skipping that step and invoking the kernel might work, though. Being the whole point of this article, and all :-)<br>
<p>
I did also try using it to debug the userspace binaries, but ran into problems executing more than a shell. i.e. having extracted the filesystem to my local PC, I could chroot into the router fs and invoke the shell. However, trying to invoke anything from within that shell failed. It was a while ago, and I don't have access to the PC at the moment, so I can't give an exact error message, unfortunately.<br>

For each CPU architecture supported by QEMU there is a list of machine types (i.e. "boards") that are available.  A machine type includes the platform devices and default hardware on a motherboard or system-on-chip.<br>
<p>
If QEMU includes a machine type that is close enough to your ZTE router's hardware, then running the firmware should be doable.  If not, you'll hit problems every time the firmware (bootloader, kernel, or userspace) tries to talk to missing hardware.<br>
<p>
You can query available machine types like this:<br>
  $ qemu-system-mips -M \?<br>

The -bios flag takes the name of a file containing the boot code.<br>
<p>
When emulating a MIPS Inc Malta development board, for example, QEMU will try to load 4MB of stuff from a virtualised flash ROM, but if you specify -bios, it'll load 4MB from a file instead. As the Malta board would, it plonks it at the MIPS reset interrupt vector address and starts running.<br>
<p>
As others have said, though, from what little I know the boot code will be specific to the hardware platform. I'd imagine it'll be doing stuff like making LEDs flash by writing to memory-mapped registers. You could disassemble it (objdump -D) to see what it's up to, depending on how good your knowledge of MIPS assembler is.<br>

I use QEMU for kernel hacking via the serial port as well. I go the route of using root= and asking qemu to use a file as a raw disk, a file on which I have prepared an ext4 system. Then I can mount this ext4 file on my host system and tweak the userspace between QEMU boots, or easily switch between several different userspaces. Using ttys0 and -nographic is also great, but can be annoying with all of the logging you're likely to get during boot up.<br>

As an aside, if you don't want to mess around with gen_init_cpio or disk images there is a third option: an initramfs directly linked into the kernel. Just set CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE to point to the description file for gen_init_cpio, and optionally CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID and ROOT_GID to allow you to map things like your init file to the root user in the resulting image. All (relative) paths in the description file are relative to the srcdir (AIUI: it might be the objdir, I tend to use srcdir==objdir builds and can't remember which it is); the image is built under the usr/ subdirectory and linked into the kernel as part of the kernel build process.<br>
<p>
(I use this process for all my kernels, because it makes it impossible for the initrd and kernel to ever get out of sync with each other or get separated from each other.)<br>

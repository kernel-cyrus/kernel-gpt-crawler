           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 24, 2010</br>
           </div>
It has been exactly one year since LWN last <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/320508/">checked up on the checkpoint/restart
patch set</a>.  This code has just been <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/375716/">reposted</a> with a request for
inclusion into the -mm tree, so it seems like an opportune time to restart
our coverage of it.  A lot of progress has been made on this front over the
last year, but checkpoint/restart remains a difficult task which can
probably never be implemented completely.
<p>
"Checkpointing" refers to the act of saving the state of a group of
processes to a file, with the intent of restarting those processes at some
future time.  For many years, checkpointing has been used to save the state
of long-running calculations to avoid losing work should the system fail.
More recently, it has become a desired part of the virtualization toolkit,
enabling the live migration of processes between physical hosts.  The
checkpoint/restart developers also see other potential advantages, such as
the ability to quickly launch a set of processes on demand from a
checkpoint image.
<p>
This patch set addresses checkpoint/restart in the containers context.
In the context of full virtualization, checkpointing is relatively easy;
the system just needs to save the entire memory image associated with the
virtual machine and a bit of associated data.  The "containers" model of
virtualization tends to be messier in almost every way, and checkpointing
is no exception.  There is no memory image to be saved in one big chunk;
instead, the kernel must track down every bit of state associated with the
checkpointed processes and save it independently.  When it works, it can be
faster and more efficient than full virtual machine checkpointing; the
checkpoint image will be much smaller.  But getting it to work is a
challenge.  The complexity of this task can be seen in <a href="http://www.linux-cr.org/git/?p=linux-cr.git;a=summary">the
current checkpoint/restart tree</a>, which, despite being far from a complete
solution of the problem, is a 27,000-line diff from
2.6.33-rc8.
<p>
<h4>Checkpointing</h4>
<p>
To checkpoint a group of processes, the following new system call is used:
<p>
<pre>
    int checkpoint(pid_t pid, int fd, unsigned long flags, int logfd);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>pid</tt> parameter identifies the top-level process to be
checkpointed; all children of that process will also be included in the
checkpoint image, which will be written to the file indicated by
<tt>fd</tt>.  There is currently only one possible flag value,
<tt>CHECKPOINT_SUBTREE</tt>, which turns off the normal requirement that an
entire container be checkpointed as a whole.  Checkpointing just a subtree
is a bit riskier than checkpointing a full container because it is harder to
ensure that all needed resources have been saved.  The <tt>logfd</tt>
parameter is file descriptor open for writing; 
the kernel will write relevant logging information there.  There are vast
numbers of possible ways for a checkpoint to fail; the log file is intended
to help users figure out what is happening when a checkpoint refuses to
work.  If logging is not desired, <tt>logfd</tt> can be <tt>-1</tt>.
<p>
The set of processes to be checkpointed should be frozen prior to the call
to <tt>checkpoint()</tt>.  One exception to that rule is a process running
in <tt>checkpoint()</tt> itself; this exception allows processes to
checkpoint themselves.
<p>
Internally, the checkpointing process is implemented as a two-phase
operation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The kernel traverses the tree of processes and "collects" every 
     object which is to be a part of the checkpoint image.  Essentially,
     "collecting" means building a hash table with an entry for every
     process, every open file, every virtual memory area, every open
     socket, etc. which must be saved.  Scanning the tree in this way helps
     the kernel to abort the checkpoint process early if something which
     cannot be checkpointed is encountered.  Just as importantly, the collecting process
     also lets the system track objects which have multiple references
     and ensure that they are only written to the image file once.
<p>
<li> The second pass then iterates over the collected objects and causes
     each to be serialized and written to the image file.
</ul>
<p>
Once this is done, the checkpoint is finished.  The just-checkpointed
processes can either go on with their business or be killed, depending on
the reason for the checkpoint.
<p>
These two phases are reflected in the changes made to the lower levels of the
system.  For example, the none-too-svelte <tt>file_operations</tt>
structure gains two new operations:
<p>
<pre>
    int collect(struct ckpt_ctx *ctx, struct file *filp);
    int checkpoint(struct ckpt_ctx *ctx, struct file *filp);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>collect()</tt> operation should identify every object which must
be saved, eventually passing each to <tt>ckpt_obj_collect()</tt> (or
one of several higher-level interfaces) for tracking.  Later, a call to
<tt>checkpoint()</tt> is made to request that the given <tt>filp</tt> be serialized for
saving to the checkpoint image.  Similar methods have been added to a
number of other structure types, including <tt>vm_operations_struct</tt> and
<tt>proto_ops</tt>.
<p>
The serialization process requires copying data from kernel data structures
into a series of special structures intended to be written to the image
file.  So, for example, a file descriptor finds its way from
<tt>struct&nbsp;fdtable</tt> into one of these: 
<p>
<pre>
    struct ckpt_hdr_file_desc {
	struct ckpt_hdr h;
	__s32 fd_objref;
	__s32 fd_descriptor;
	__u32 fd_close_on_exec;
    } __attribute__((aligned(8)));
</pre>
<p>
Doing this copy requires a 75-line function which grabs the requisite
information and very carefully checks that everything can be checkpointed
successfully.  In this case, the presence of locks on the file or an owner
(to be notified with <tt>SIGIO</tt>) will cause the checkpoint to fail.  In
the absence of such roadblocks, the completed structure is handed to the
checkpoint code for saving to the image file.
<p>
This serialization process is one of the scarier parts of the whole
checkpoint/restart concept.  Any changes to <tt>struct&nbsp;fdtable</tt> will
almost certainly break this serialization, quite possibly in ways which
will not be detected until some user runs into a problem.  Even if a VFS
developer cared about checkpointing, they might not think to look
at the code in <tt>checkpoint/files.c</tt> to see if anything might require
changing.  Similar dependencies are created for every other kernel data
structure which must be checkpointed.
The whole setup looks like it could be a little fragile; keeping
it working is almost certain to require significant ongoing maintenance.
<p>
<h4>Restarting</h4>
<p>
On the restart side, the application performing the restart is first expected to create a set
of processes to be animated with the checkpointed information.  That
creation will be done with the much-reviewed "extended <tt>clone()</tt>"
system call, which, in this iteration, looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    int eclone(u32 flags_low, struct clone_args *cargs, int cargs_size,
	       pid_t *pids);
</pre>
<p>
With <tt>eclone()</tt>, the processes can be created with specific
<tt>pids</tt> and with an extended set of flags.
<p>
Once the process hierarchy exists, the <tt>restart()</tt> system call can
be used:
<p>
<pre>
    int restart(pid_t pid, int fd, unsigned long flags, int logfd);
</pre>
<p>
The checkpoint image found at <tt>fd</tt> will be restored into the process
hierarchy starting at <tt>pid</tt>.  Once again, <tt>logfd</tt> can be used
to gain information on how the process went.  There are a number of
<tt>flags</tt> defined: <tt>RESTART_TASKSELF</tt> (a single task is being
restarted on top of the process calling <tt>restart()</tt>),
<tt>RESTART_FROZEN</tt> (causes the restarted processes to be left frozen
at the end), <tt>RESTART_GHOST</tt> (appears to be a debugging feature),
<tt>RESTART_KEEP_LSM</tt> (restore security labels too), and
<tt>RESTART_CONN_RESET</tt> (force the closing of open sockets).  On a
successful return from <tt>restart()</tt>, the process hierarchy should be
ready to go.
<p>

Once again, restart requires support at the lower levels of the kernel.  So
our long-suffering <tt>file_operations</tt> structure gains another
function:
<p>
<pre>
    int restore(struct ckpt_ctx *, struct ckpt_hdr_file *);
</pre>
<p>
This function (along with its analogs elsewhere in the kernel) is charged
with reanimating the given object from the checkpoint file.

<p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
It is not hard to imagine that these new system calls could have any of a
number of security-related consequences, so it is surprising to see that,
in the current implementation, both <tt>checkpoint()</tt> and
<tt>restart()</tt> are unprivileged operations.  This decision was made
deliberately, with the idea of forcing the developers to think about
security issues from the outset.
<p>
The biggest potential problem with <tt>checkpoint()</tt> is probably
information disclosure.  To avoid this problem, <tt>checkpoint()</tt> is
only able to checkpoint processes which the caller would be able to call
<tt>ptrace()</tt> on.  So there should be no way for a hostile user to gain
information from a checkpoint image which would not be available anyway.
<p>
The restart side is a little more frightening; it allows the caller to load
vast amounts of potentially arbitrary data into kernel data structures.
This risk is, one hopes, mitigated by causing all operations to be done in
the context of the calling process.  If the caller cannot open a file
directly, that file cannot be opened via a corrupted checkpoint image
either.  Doing things this way will break certain use cases, such as
checkpointing a setuid program which has since dropped its privileges, but
there is probably no way to make that case work securely for unprivileged
users.
<p>
For an added challenge, the checkpoint/restart developers have also
implemented the checkpointing of security labels on objects.  By default,
these labels will not be used during the restart process, but the
<tt>RESTART_KEEP_LSM</tt> flag can change that.  Again, the labels are
created in the context of the calling process, so the active security
module <i>should</i> prevent the attachment of labels which compromise the
security of the system.

<p>
Even with these measures in place, one still has to wonder about the security of
the process as a whole.  The kernel is populating a wide array of data
structures from input which may be under the control of a hostile user; it
is not hard to imagine that, somewhere in tens of thousands of lines of
checkpoint/restart code, an important check has not been made.  Perhaps as
a result of this concern, the patch set adds a sysctl knob which can be set
to disallow unprivileged checkpoint/restart operations.

<p>
<h4>Where things stand</h4>
<p>
According to the most recent patch posting:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This one is able to checkpoint/restart screen and vnc sessions, and
	live-migrate network servers between hosts. It also adds support
	for x86-64 (in addition to x86-32, s390x and powerpc).
</div>
<p>
So the patch set appears to be sufficiently functional to be minimally
useful.  There are, however, a lot of things which can stil prevent the
creation of a successful checkpoint; they are summarized on <a
href="http://ckpt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Checklist">this page</a>.
Problem areas include private filesystem mounts, network sockets in some
states, open-but-unlinked files, use of any of the file event notification
interfaces, open files on network or FUSE filesystems, use of netlink,
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, asynchronous I/O, and more.  There are patches in the
works for some of these problems; others look hard.
<p>
As of this writing, there has been no response to the developers' request
for inclusion in the -mm kernel.  In the past, there have been concerns
about how much work would be required to finish the job.  Over the last
year, much of that work is done, but checkpoint/restart looks like a job
which is never truly finished.  It's mostly a matter of whether what has
been done so far appears to be good enough for real work, and whether the
maintenance cost of this code is deemed to be worth paying.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Code placement is definitely something to fix. Recently I've been working on moving checkpoint/* contents to more appropriate places in the kernel sources for precisely this reason.

Matt wasn't talking (I don't think) about the checkpoint image format,<br>
which (IIUC) is what you would be addressing with your suggestion.<br>
<p>
I personally think the main maintainability concern is that updates to<br>
object creation/destruction/updates code not require maintainers to know<br>
to look at other random places like checkpoint/file.c to update<br>
corresponding checkpoint and restart code.  That is why we have made it<br>
a point to re-use existing (or create) helpers like cred_setresuid()<br>
in the checkpoint and restart paths, so that updates to the core helpers<br>
will automatically update checkpoint/restart code as well.<br>
<p>
In addition to this, Matt is working on moving everything (or nearly<br>
everything) that is under checkpoint/ into the right files in the core<br>
code, i.e. checkpoint/file.c helpers likely belong in fs/namei.c, <br>
fs/open.c,<br>
fs/namespace.c etc.<br>
<p>
Now, what you're talking about with auto-generation of headers has also<br>
been discussed, and specifically suggested by Andrew Morgan<br>
(i.e. <a href="https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-">https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2...</a><br>
June/018289.html ).  But I think it's still an open question whether<br>
that will just obfuscate what is really going on, and whether it is<br>
addressing a real problem.  If it turns out to be a real problem, then<br>
we're certainly open to it!<br>

Hi K3n,<br>
<p>
That actually gets us suprisingly little. Yes, there's a good amount of code that looks like:<br>
<p>
        save_field = struct_field;<br>
<p>
but that's not most of what we do. Locking, error handling, and reference counting account for much of the rest of it. We don't assume that the freezer protects kernel data structures for checkpoint/restart. The freezer is there to ensure the checkpointed tasks themselves aren't doing anything - inside or outside the kernel. That doesn't prevent non-frozen tasks from using things inside the kernel (shared struct files for example). Even if we limited ourselves to freezing "whole containers" this would be a problem. So we need to take the appropriate locks in the right order, hold references while we checkpoint, and avoid sleeping sometimes.<br>
<p>
More extreme solutions using lists could be made to work but the code, memory, and performance of that approach is actually much worse. We could stop all other cpus on the machine while we checkpoint. Then we couldn't use most of the existing kernel code though because the functions we want to reused wouldn't be allowed to grab locks, sleep, or reliably allocate memory. That means even more new code and more fragile code too. We'd also need to know beforehand exactly how much memory is needed for the checkpoint image. Finally, it would all have to fit in kernel memory. Given that userspace tasks can use large amounts of memory that's not very practical.<br>

Shouldn't the restoring be done entirely in user space?  That would deal with many of the security questions raised in the article.<br>

We've gone down that road before - see for instance <a href="http://git.sr71.net/?">http://git.sr71.net/?</a><br>
p=cryodev.git;a=summary.  There are a boatload of things you cannot do from <br>
userspace.  In particular, specifying identifiers for resources like <br>
sysvipc.<br>

      <p>What's more, some parts of restart <b>are</b> done in userspace when it allows us to keep the kernel code much simpler. The process tree is recreated in userspace for example. As another example we also plan on using execve() to ensure that checkpoint images containing 32 and 64-bit processes are restarted correctly.</p>
<p>
The in-kernel alternative for the process tree tended to involve creating kernel threads and then stripping them of their "special" status as kernel threads. Doing it in userspace with clone() (or eclone()) will be much easier to review and maintain.</p>
<p>
The in-kernel alternative for the second example is to have sys_restart() do the 32/64-bit mm switches. That switch had to be carefully orchestrated for execve() where the kernel can throw away lots of state. We can't throw away as much state in sys_restart() so orchestrating that switch is even harder there. Plus it adds to the maintenance burden of arch maintainers. By using execve() we'll avoid all of that.</p>
<p>
Easing maintenance has been a concern of ours for a long time and we're open to new suggestions from maintainers for making it even easier.</p>

      <blockquote>Doing things this way will break certain use cases, such as checkpointing a setuid program which has since dropped its privileges, but there is probably no way to make that case work securely for unprivileged users.</blockquote>The problem with restoring a setuid program is that users might be able to modify the serialized state. Why not use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">MAC</a> to authenticate the saved state?  Administrators would need to provide a secret key not visible to ordinary users, of course, but that would be trivial to provide via a sysctl.
<p>
On the other hand, it seems like it'd be possible to implement this authenticated-checkpoint functionality from userspace by asking a privileged process to do the checkpointing and restoration on behalf of an ordinary user.

Indeed we definately intend to exploit the TPM, and have it sign valid<br>
checkpoint images.<br>
<p>
As for using MAC, you can certainly set up an assured pipeline using<br>
SELinux policy to make sure that noone can modify a checkpoint image,<br>
and that /bin/restart runs in a domain which can only read valid<br>
checkpoint images.  Hmm, well, I suppose /bin/restart_wrapper would<br>
only be able to open validated checkpoint images, then pass those in<br>
to /bin/restart (restart itself will need to open all the files used<br>
by the restarted program).<br>
<p>
Finally, note that an unprivileged user can neither checkpoint nor<br>
restart a setuid program.  It can't checkpoint it because it will fail<br>
the ptrace access checks, and can't restart it because sys_restart() will<br>
try to do cred_setresuid() to an effective userid of 0 and fail (or open<br>
a resource which the unprivileged user cannot access, and fail).<br>

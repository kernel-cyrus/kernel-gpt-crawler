The DMA zone (<tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>) is a memory-management holdover from the
distant past.  Once upon a time, many devices (those on the ISA bus in
particular) could only use 24&nbsp;bits for DMA addresses, and were thus
limited to the bottom 16MB of memory.  Such devices are hard to find on
contemporary computers.  Luis Rodriguez scheduled the last
memory-management-track session of the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit to discuss whether the time has come to remove
<tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> altogether.
<p>
Rodriguez, however, was late to his own session, so the developers started
discussing the topic without him.  It's not clear that any modern devices
still need the DMA zone, and removing it would free one precious page

<a href="/Articles/753275/"><img

flag.  Any requests with the <tt>GFP_DMA</tt> flag could be redirected to
the zone for the contiguous memory allocator (CMA) which, in turn, could be
given the bottom 16MB of memory to manage.  Matthew Wilcox asked whether
the same thing could be done with <tt>ZONE_DMA32</tt>, used for devices
that can only DMA to 32-bit addresses, but it is not possible to allocate
all of the lowest 4GB of memory to that zone, since it would exclude kernel
allocations.
<p>
It was noted in passing that the POWER architecture uses <tt>GFP_DMA</tt>
extensively.  It doesn't actually need it, though; the early POWER
developers had misunderstood the flag and thought that it was needed for
any memory that would be used for DMA.
<p>
At this point, Rodriguez arrived and presented his case.  He noted that the
existence of <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> causes an extra branch to be taken in every
memory allocation call.  Perhaps removing the zone could improve
performance by taking out the need for those branches.  It's not clear that
performance would improve all that much, but the developers would be happy
to be rid of this ancient zone regardless.
<p>
The problem is that quite a few drivers are still using <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>,
even if a number of them don't really need it.  The SCSI subsystem was
mentioned as having a number of allocations using it.  Wilcox suggested
that perhaps the drivers still using <tt>ZONE_DMA</tt> could be moved to
the staging tree; they could then either be fixed and moved back or just
removed entirely.  A look at the list of affected drivers (which can be
found in <a href="/Articles/753274/">this summary of the session</a> posted
by Rodriguez) suggests that just deleting them is probably not an option,
though.
<p>
More work will be needed to determine the real effects of changing this
zone, and of possibly redirecting it into the CMA zone instead.  But its
removal would simplify the memory-management subsystem, so there is
motivation for the developers to do the necessary research.

We also have a couple of ARM platforms, including  IIRC the modern shmobile parts that use ZONE_DMA for various other platform specific limitations that are distinct from the 24 bit ISA bus constraints.<br>
<p>
CMA can probably work around most of those, but one would have to look not only at drivers that explicitly use GFP_DMA but also those that set a dma_mask smaller than 0xffffffff, either in the driver or inherited from the parent bus in DT.<br>

On ARM, enabling DMA_CMA forces all DMA allocations to be made from the CMA, which means that if your CMA isn't big enough, you'll run out of memory.  We've had to set the CMA size to 0 by default for our kernels, otherwise DMA allocations start to fail.<br>

The PowerPC case isn't that simple ;-) We did have early PowerPC systems such as PReP machines, that did have ISA busses along with similar DMA limitations.<br>
<p>
On other systems, for a while became equiv. to ZONE_DMA32 at a time where the latter didn't exist yet.<br>
<p>
That said, I don't find many use in our code left these days, what did you spot that's still "wrong" in your opinion ?<br>

Unfortunately ZONE_DMA does not always mean the lowest 16MB.<br>
On s390 we use GFP_DMA to allocate buffers below 2GB. This is still necessary for several hardware interfaces so we certainly need a way to allocate buffers in that region.<br>

We need it to be below 2GB (the old 31bit mode has survived in some places).<br>
Right now ZONE_DMA is defined to be exactly that on s390x. We could of course redefine everything to be GFP_DMA32 (which does not exist yet) but this seems a pointless rename.<br>

By the way, the intended way for drivers to allocate memory below 2GB is the DMA allocation API with a mask of 1&lt;&lt;31 -1. Is that doable? GFP_DMA might be used to implement that interface, but it's easier to deal with that than dozens of drivers.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; By the way, the intended way for drivers to allocate memory below 2GB is the DMA allocation API with a mask of 1&lt;&lt;31 -1. Is that doable? </font><br>
<p>
No. This is not about driver code, this is about core code that calls some classic CISC instructions that require control blocks that might have some satellite blocks via pointers. And sometimes some specific satellite blocks need to be below 2GB.<br>
<p>
Another thing about dma mask: This does not keep this area free unless needed. GFP_DMA does that. <br>
Imagine a system with 3 GB of memory.<br>
2GB ZONE_DMA<br>
1GB ZONE_NORMAL (or movable)<br>
<p>
<p>
If the page cache now needs 2GB, it will consome the 1GB in ZONE_NORMAL and after that 1GB in ZONE_DMA. So we can still handle all DMA requests. If we have no dedicated zone then there is is higher chance that pages &lt;2GB are used making allocation in there less likely.<br>
<p>
So I think your understanding of ZONE_DMA usage (the x86 way) is not exactly how s390x uses it - I fear.<br>

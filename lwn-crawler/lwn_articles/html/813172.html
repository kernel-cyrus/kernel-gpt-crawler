           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 24, 2020</br>
           </div>
Filesystems, by design, hide a lot of complexity from users.  At times,
though, those users need to be able to look inside the black box and extract
information about what is going on within a filesystem.  Answering this
need is David Howells, the creator of a number of filesystem-oriented
system calls; in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/158230810644.2185128.16726948836367716086.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch set</a> he tries to add three more, one of which we have seen before
and two of which are new.
<p>
The new system calls, <tt>watch_mount()</tt> and <tt>watch_sb()</tt>, provide
ways for a process to request notifications whenever something changes at
either a mount point (<tt>watch_mount()</tt>) or within a specific mounted
filesystem (<tt>watch_sb()</tt>, the "<tt>sb</tt>" standing for
"superblock").  For a mount point, events of interest can include the
mounting or unmounting of filesystems anywhere below the mount point, the
change of an attribute like read-only, movement of mount points, and more.
Filesystem-specific events can also include attribute changes, along with
filesystem errors, quota problems, or network issues for remote
filesystems.
<p>
These system calls are built on a newer version of the <a
href="/Articles/790831/">event-notification mechanism</a> that Howells has
been working on for some time.  In the past, getting notifications has
involved opening a new device (<tt>/dev/watch_queue</tt>), but that
interface has changed in the meantime.  In the current version, a process
calls <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html"><tt>pipe2()</tt></a>
with the new <tt>O_NOTIFICATION_PIPE</tt> flag to create a special type of
pipe meant for notification use.  The writable side of this pipe is not
used by the application; the file descriptor for the readable end
can be passed to either of the new system calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int watch_mount(int dirfd, const char *path, unsigned int flags,
    		    int watch_fd, int watch_id);
    int watch_sb(int dirfd, const char *path, unsigned int flags,
    		 int watch_fd, int watch_id);
</pre>
<p>
In both cases, <tt>dirfd</tt>, <tt>path</tt>, and <tt>flags</tt> identify
the directory of interest in the usual <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html"><tt>openat()</tt></a>
style.  The 
notification pipe is passed in as <tt>watch_fd</tt>, and <tt>watch_id</tt>
is an integer value that will be returned in any generated events.  There
is a special case, though; if <tt>watch_id</tt> is <tt>-1</tt>, any
existing watch using the given <tt>watch_fd</tt> will be removed.
<p>
The application receives events by reading from the pipe.
By default all events affecting the given watch point will be returned.
The application can, though, create a filter that is attached to the
notification pipe with an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call.  There's another
<tt>ioctl()</tt> call to set the size of the buffer used to hold
notifications sent to user space.  Curious readers can see these system
calls used in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/tree/samples/watch_queue/watch_test.c?h=fsinfo-core">this
sample program</a>. 
<p>
Unlike the system calls described above, <tt>fsinfo()</tt> has been <a
href="/Articles/792628/">seen 
before</a>.  Its prototype remains the same:
<p>
<pre>
    int fsinfo(int dirfd, const char *path, const struct fsinfo_params *params,
	       void *buffer, size_t buf_size);
</pre>
<p>
As before, <tt>dirfd</tt> and <tt>path</tt> describe the filesystem for
which information is requested; there is no <tt>flags</tt> argument here,
but it is hidden within the <tt>params</tt> structure, which looks like
this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct fsinfo_params {
	__u32	at_flags;
	__u32	flags;
	__u32	request;
	__u32	Nth;
	__u32	Mth;
	__u64	__reserved[3];
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>at_flags</tt> field contains the same flags that one would
ordinarily expect to see in an <tt>openat()</tt>-style system call.
The <tt>request</tt> field describes the information that is
being asked for; a number of possible values can be found in <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/158230816405.2185128.14624101691579582829.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch</a> from the series.  Potentially available information
("potentially" because filesystems are not required to implement every
possibility) include filesystem limits, timestamp resolution information,
the volume UUID, the servers behind a remote filesystem, and more.  For
attributes that can have multiple values, the <tt>Nth</tt> and <tt>Mth</tt>
fields can be used to select one in particular.
<p>
The format of the returned value is ... complex.  Values are stored into 
the provided <tt>buffer</tt> in any of a number of formats, depending on
what was requested.  For some, a structure is returned; others return a
string or a type called simply "opaque".  There is some documentation in <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/158230822028.2185128.5408262159157374165.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch</a>, but it seems clear that potential users of this system call will
have to do some digging to figure out the information that will be returned
to them.
<p>
This patch set is now in its 17th revision, having evolved quite a bit over
the years.  The one comment on this version, so far, comes from James
Bottomley, who <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/1582316494.3376.45.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">suggested</a>
that there may not be a need for <tt>fsinfo()</tt> at all.  Instead, with
some changes to how <tt>fsconfig()</tt> (which is used to configure
filesystem attributes) is implemented, it could be turned into an interface
that could both set and read attributes.  So far, Howells has not responded
to that suggestion.
<p>
Overall, the fact that these patches have been through
17 revisions (so far) says a lot.  Nobody doubts that getting this
information out of the kernel would be useful, but the API remains complex
and hard for potential users to understand.  Whether that can be fixed
while retaining the features provided by these system calls is not clear,
though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

And the explicit padding between an odd number of 32-bit fields, and the 64-bit fields.<br>
Fortunately the latter is present in the real declaration:<br>
<p>
        __u32   __reserved32[1]; /* Reserved params; all must be 0 */<br>

Perhaps that can be traded for an explicit structure length?<br>

      Indeed, that was the entire point of copy_struct_from_user() -- so that new syscalls can be extensible and avoid the need to predict how many future fields you might want (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggD-eb3yPVs">I gave a talk about this at LCA this year</a>). I've sent a suggestion to the ML, though there is some discussion on the latest thread to remove the need for fsinfo(2) entirely.

Regardless of whether netlink would be a good way to do it, this is yet another way to get a string of notifications from the kernel. I do wonder why nobody is complaining loudly that this should use, or maybe improve upon, one of the existing mechanisms.<br>

not sure if the fact that this existed so long without a lot of people noticing makes it better or worse.<br>
But I have to agree, having one encouraged interface (probably netlink, or maybe even epoll here?) to be used for any new interface of this type would be a good idea<br>

This doesn’t really seem like a big deal - novel and different mechanisms are a problem when they’re, well, novel and different.  This is just a pipe, and unless I’ve missed something, it’s not requiring implementing anything.<br>
<p>
I mean maybe netlink would be superior, but this seems nicely trivial.  It’s not like they’re knocking up a netlink competitor, just using a trivial interface where they can.<br>

I'm trying to make a generic notification system, with such properties as:<br>
- messages can be longer than 8 bytes (say up to 128 bytes);<br>
- message queueing requires no on-the-spot allocation and can be done from softirq/irq context or inside spinlocks;<br>
- messages can come from a variety of sources (e.g. mount(2), add_key(2), keyctl(2), sb errors, usb notifications, ...);<br>
- messages from different sources can be in the same queue;<br>
- messages may need copying into multiple queues;<br>
- filters can be easily employed;<br>
- message loss reporting.<br>
<p>
As has been mentioned, there are existing solutions:<br>
- Netlink:<br>
  - would make the core VFS dependent on the networking code.<br>
  - would require GFP_ATOMIC message allocation at the point of generation (at least sometimes).<br>
  - doesn't seem to make it easy to do message loss reporting.<br>
- epoll is for dealing with file descriptors - but we're not dealing with fd events.<br>
- Not all sources I need notifications for can be addressed with fanotify.<br>
- eventfd() has 8-byte messages.<br>
<p>
Pipes have disadvantages too: no message loss reporting (I'm having to add it); pipe ring buffer metadata elements generally larger than common messages (might be able to optimise in future to store small data in the ring).  Note that I didn't want to use pipes either: I was originally using a mappable chardev ring buffer but Linus said I had to use pipes instead.<br>

There is also eventfd(2)<br>
<p>
A pipe seems really awkward for one-way event notifications.<br>

eventfd is limited to 8-byte messages.  That is not sufficient.<br>

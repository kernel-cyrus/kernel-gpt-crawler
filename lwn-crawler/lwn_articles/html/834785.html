           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 22, 2020</br>

The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
system call allows user space to load one or more (classic) BPF programs
to be run whenever the calling process invokes a system call.  Those
programs can examine (<a href="/Articles/799557/">to an extent</a>) the
arguments to each call and inform the kernel whether the call should be
allowed to proceed or not.  This feature is used in a number of
containerization solutions (and beyond) as a way of reducing the kernel's
attack surface.  In some situations, though, using <tt>seccomp()</tt> can result
in a significant performance reduction.  There are currently two patch sets
in circulation that are aimed at reducing the overhead of
<tt>seccomp()</tt> for one common use case.
<p>
The argument-inspection feature of <tt>seccomp()</tt> is useful in a number
of settings; it can, for example, block a <tt>write()</tt> call to any file
descriptor other than the standard output.  But many real-world use cases
do not take advantage of this capability; instead, they make decisions
based only on which system call is being invoked while paying no attention
to the arguments to those calls.  It turns out that the BPF mechanism is
far from optimal for this case, which must be implemented as a long series
of comparisons against the system-call number.  The overhead of these
comparisons can be reduced by using smarter algorithms (checking for
the most commonly used system calls first, for example), but there are
limits to how fast it can be.  This overhead makes every system call slower.
<p>
Much of this work is wasted.  If a <tt>seccomp()</tt> configuration of this
type allows <tt>read()</tt> once, it will allow it every time, but the
kernel must work it out the hard way each time regardless.  If there were
some way of knowing that a given <tt>seccomp()</tt> filter program allows
or denies specific system calls without looking at their arguments,
it would be possible to implement those decisions much more quickly.
<p>
<h4>Optimizing <tt>seccomp()</tt></h4>
<p>
In June, Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200616074934.1600036-1-keescook@chromium.org/">posted
a patch</a> implementing this sort of optimization.  It creates three
bitmaps (called <tt>allow</tt>, <tt>kill_thread</tt>, and
<tt>kill_process</tt>) within a process; they are indexed by the
system-call number.  When a system call is intercepted by
<tt>seccomp()</tt>, the associated number is used to consult those bitmaps;
if the relevant bit is set in a bitmap, the associated action is taken
without ever actually running the BPF program.  Thus, the bits for always-allowed
system calls can be set in the <tt>allow</tt> bitmap; they will then
execute far more quickly.
<p>
The trick is setting those bits in the first place.  Cook's patch set works
by actually executing the loaded BPF program(s) at load time for every
supported system call and watching what happens.  If, for a given system
call, the BPF code does not access the system-call arguments, the kernel
can conclude that the result will always be the same for that call and set
a bit in the appropriate bitmap.  If, instead, the arguments are accessed,
the bit for that system call is 
cleared in all bitmaps; the BPF program will thus be executed on every
invocation of that call.
<p>
There is another challenge here: observing whether the BPF program does, in fact,
access the system-call arguments.  The first version of the patch set did
that by placing the arguments in a separate page, running the BPF code,
then looking at the page-table entry to see whether the page had been
referenced or not.  This mechanism worked, but relied on some complex
memory-management trickery.
<p>
Jann Horn <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez1p=dR_2ikKq=xVxkoGg0fYpTBpkhJSv1w-6BG=76PAvw@mail.gmail.com/">had
a better idea</a>: simply emulate the execution of the BPF program and watch
what it does directly.  The key observation was that the emulator need not
be complete, since programs that only compare system-call numbers tend to
be quite simple.  Only a small subset of the available instructions would
need to be emulated; anything that the emulator does not recognize can be
taken as an indication that more complex logic is involved and the bitmap
cannot be used. 
<p>
On September 21, YiFei Zhu showed up with <a
href="/ml/bpf/cover.1600661418.git.yifeifz2@illinois.edu/">a patch
series</a> implementing a constant-action <tt>seccomp()</tt> bitmap using
an emulator to determine whether the system-call arguments were being
accessed or not.  There were a number of other differences from Cook's
approach; for example, only the "allow" bitmap is implemented on the
understanding that the "deny" cases do not really need to be optimized.
Two days later, Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200923232923.3142503-1-keescook@chromium.org/">posted
a new version</a> with a rather simpler emulator that is closer to the
design first suggested by Horn.  Less than one day after that, Zhu returned
with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1600946701.git.yifeifz2@illinois.edu/">a
revised series</a> with a simplified emulator that borrowed some ideas from
Cook's version.
<p>
Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/202009241253.7D238A4@keescook/">described</a> Zhu's
initial patch set as "<q>significantly over-engineered</q>" and said that
he had rushed out his updated version to show "<q>how small I would like
the emulator to be</q>" and how the architecture support could be improved.
Since then, it would appear that many of the ideas from Cook's
implementation have found their way into Zhu's.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1602431034.git.yifeifz2@illinois.edu/">Version&nbsp;5</a>
of Zhu's patch set, posted on October&nbsp;11, adds 292 lines of code to
<tt>kernel/seccomp.c</tt> — compared to 400 in the initial version — while
supporting more functionality.  Cook has not reposted his work since,
suggesting that Zhu's version may be the one that is ultimately merged.
<p>
<h4>Paths not taken</h4>
<p>
There is an interesting question to be considered here.  Emulating BPF
execution and watching what happens does not seem like the most elegant
solution to the problem; there are at least two other approaches that could
be considered:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The developers writing the <tt>seccomp()</tt> programs surely know
     what the desired behavior is.  A new <tt>seccomp()</tt> API could be
     created to allow user space to pass the bitmap in directly rather than
     having to reverse-engineer it in the kernel.
<li> <tt>seccomp()</tt> is one of the few places in the kernel still using
     the classic BPF dialect.  Switching to extended BPF would allow the
     writing of programs that could make these decisions much more quickly,
     again without the need to add code to the kernel to guess what the
     programs do.
</ul>
<p>
The question of why these approaches have not been explored has seen relatively little
discussion as these patch sets were considered.  Horn did <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez3Z5Cxxc47x8gZiy9xgEVPL5gH-g0HNPNqndkAnJCbwKw@mail.gmail.com/">note</a>
that creating a new API would require changes in user space to take
advantage of it, while the current patch sets will simply make existing programs
run more quickly with no changes required.  The proposed patches also make
no changes to the user-space API for <tt>seccomp()</tt>, meaning that the
kernel community is not committing to anything new by adopting them.  A new
API for loading the bitmask, instead, would have to be supported forever.
<p>
With regard to eBPF, adding that support to <tt>seccomp()</tt> has come up
a few times in the past; the last such would appear to be <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20180226072651.GA27045@ircssh-2.c.rugged-nimbus-611.internal/">this
patch series</a> posted by Sargun Dhillon in 2018.  There are a number of
obstacles to be overcome before this support will ever make it into the
mainline, though.  The BPF maintainers <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20180226230418.46nczgkh5csakyu7@ast-mbp/">are
concerned</a> that use of eBPF in <tt>seccomp()</tt> could constrain the
future development of eBPF itself.  Security-oriented developers, instead,
worry about the extra capabilities and attack surface provided by eBPF; it
would not be hard to introduce new vulnerabilities by putting
<tt>seccomp()</tt> and eBPF together.  There is also the little problem
that <tt>seccomp()</tt> filters can be loaded by unprivileged processes,
and giving unprivileged code the ability to load eBPF programs is an idea
that <a href="/Articles/796328/">has fallen on hard times</a>.
<p>
The end result is that the current patch sets would appear to be the best
that is on offer for improved <tt>seccomp()</tt> performance anytime soon.
The performance increase that comes with using the bitmap is real,
according to some benchmarks included with Zhu's patch set.  So one should
expect to see this optimization merged, presumably for the 5.11 development
cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

While I realize it&#x27;d add new BPF surface area, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if it would make sense to have a simple boolean lookup table mechanism, so that a BPF filter could say &quot;if the syscall number is in the pass list, OK&quot;, or &quot;if the syscall number is in the deny list, kill the process&quot;. That seems simpler than building a recognizer for &quot;check syscall number&quot; logic.<br>

The eBPF maintainers have made it a policy that cBPF is frozen and no new features can be added to it -- if we want to use any new features we&#x27;d need to port seccomp to eBPF which has the downsides mentioned in the article (not to mention that this solution also has the downsides of a new API for this optimisation -- older userspace won&#x27;t benefit from the improvement). And while it is inelegant, cBPF emulation is already done by the kernel in several spots.<br>

It&#x27;s unfortunate that they have simultaneously taken the positions that cBPF is frozen and eBPF is only usable by root. So non-root users will never get any new BPF features because ... ?<br>

Non-root users _can_ use eBPF...perhaps unfortunately. Just, not in seccomp filters.<br>
<p>
This cve description is a great read, and a nice illustration of why letting unprivileged users use eBPF can be scary. But adding more features to cBPF seems likely to make it just as scary...<br>

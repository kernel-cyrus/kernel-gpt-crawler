<p>
A longstanding out-of-tree kernel feature&mdash;used by half-a-dozen or more
virus scanners&mdash;<a
href="http://dazuko.dnsalias.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Dazuko</a> has
recently changed its <i>modus operandi</i> in an effort to be included into
the mainline.  Dazuko, and now <a href="/Articles/317785/">DazukoFS</a>,
are mechanisms to control access to files, which are generally used to stop
Windows 
viruses from propagating on Linux servers.  The goal is similar in many
ways to that of <a
href="/Articles/311850/#fsnotify">fsnotify</a>/<a
href="/Articles/306804/">fanotify</a>/<a 
href="/Articles/295568/">TALPA</a>, but the 
DazukoFS implementation as a stackable filesystem is a completely different
approach.   
</p>

<p>
The Dazuko project started almost exactly seven years ago as an effort to
allow user-space programs&mdash;Windows-style anti-virus scanners
mostly&mdash;to make file access decisions.  One of the reasons to have
the scanning in user space&mdash;aside from the zero probability of
getting one added to the kernel&mdash;is to keep it vendor-neutral by not
favoring any particular anti-virus engine.  But the means to that end was
system call hooking, which is a technique that is seriously frowned upon by
kernel hackers.  Dazuko made an 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/206075/">abortive move to the LSM
API</a>, but ran into various problems, including the inability to stack
multiple security modules.  Eventually, the project started looking at a
stackable filesystem as a solution 
that would be palatable for moving into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Originally suggested for Dazuko by Christoph Hellwig in 2004, a stackable
filesystem 
has a number of advantages over the other solutions.  It is a
self-contained solution that won't require core kernel code changes if
anti-virus developers wish to add new features.  It also would add another
stackable filesystem to the kernel, which may help foster a more general
stackable filesystem framework.  But the main reason is
that the project sees it as the most likely
path into the mainline.  Main developer John Ogness <a
href="/Articles/317785/">explains</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote">
Nearly seven years of out-of-tree development were more than
enough to prove that out-of-tree kernel drivers have an unnecessarily
large maintenance cost (which increases with each new kernel
release). With DazukoFS mainline, anti-virus vendors would finally
have an official interface and implementation on which to base their
online scanning applications.
</div>
</p>

<p>
DazukoFS is mounted atop an already-mounted filesystem in order to handle file
access decisions for files in the underlying filesystem.  For example:
<pre>
    mount -t dazukofs /opt /opt 
</pre>
sets up the <tt>/opt</tt> filesystem
for checking by user-space processes that open a special <tt>/dev</tt>
file.  All of the scanning application interaction with DazukoFS
is done through <tt>/dev</tt> files, all of which is
documented in <tt><a
href="/Articles/318741/">Documentation/filesystems/dazukofs.txt</a></tt>
</p>

<p>
File access decisions are made by processes or threads which make up a
"group".  Groups act as a pool of available scanners to allow multiple
outstanding file access decisions.  Once the pool is fully occupied, file
accesses will block until one becomes available.  Groups are registered by
writing "<tt>add=MyGroupName</tt>" to <tt>/dev/dazukofs.ctrl</tt>.  A
group id will then be assigned, which can be parsed from the output of reading
the <tt>dazukofs.ctrl</tt> file.  Group ids are then used to access the
proper device for providing access decisions. 
</p>

<p>
Based on the group id (N), a <tt>/dev/dazukofs.N</tt> file is created.
Each process in the group registers itself by opening that device.  It
should then block in a read of the device waiting for a file access event.
Each event has three pieces of information that are read from the device file:
an event id, the process id of the accessing program, and the number of an
open file descriptor that can be used to read the contents of the file.
The scanning process should then perform whatever actions it requires to
make the decision whether to allow or deny the access.
</p>

<p>
Because it gets passed an open file descriptor, the scanning process does
not need any special privileges beyond those required to access the
<tt>/dev/dazukofs*</tt> files.  Once it has made the decision, the scanning
process writes a string indicating the result to the device.  It is then
responsible for closing the file descriptor for the accessed file.
</p>

<p>
There are a few additional things that can be done via the user-space API:
deleting groups, providing for some crash protection within groups, and
handling accesses 
to protected files from within DazukoFS, all of which are described in the
<tt>Documentation</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
There is also a major caveat that goes with this release of DazukoFS: 
<div class="BigQuote">
DazukoFS does not support writing to memory mapped files. This should not
  cause the kernel to crash, but will instead result in the application
  failing to perform the writes (although mmap() will appear to be
  successful from the application's viewpoint!).
</div>
</p>

<p>
That is done, at least partially, to avoid race conditions where a
malicious program overwrites 
the file contents between the scanning and the actual access.  This is a
general achilles' heel for virus scanning mechanisms, but silently ignoring
writes to mapped files is a rather extreme reaction to that problem.
TALPA, which has subsequently become fanotify, defines this problem away as
not being a part of the threat model it is handling.  Perhaps DazukoFS
should do something similar.
</p>

<p>
It would seem likely that only one of the two proposed solutions for
user-space file scanning will end up in the mainline.  Ogness mentions
fanotify in his patch submission:
<div class="BigQuote">
I am aware of the current work of Eric Paris to implement a file
access control mechanism within a unified inotify/dnotify
framework. Although I welcome any official interface to provide a file
access control mechanism for userspace applications in Linux, I feel
that DazukoFS provides a more elegant solution. (Note that the two
projects do not conflict with each other.)
</div>
</p>

<p>
So far, there has been no comment on the v2 patch submission, but there
were some suggestions to the <a href="/Articles/312716/">first
submission</a> back in December.  The kernel filesystem hackers are pretty
busy folks in general, but right now there are numerous filesystems in
various states of review: btrfs, POHMELFS, DST, FS-Cache, and others.
Those may be 
using up all of the available review bandwidth.  Ogness recently <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/dazuko-devel/2009-02/msg00001.html">announced</a>
that he will be dropping support for the 2.x version of Dazuko&mdash;based
on system call hooks&mdash;to focus on
DazukoFS.  In it he notes the lack of review:
<div class="BigQuote">
As you probably know, DazukoFS has been submitted for inclusion in the
mainline Linux kernel. Unfortunately it is getting practically no
attention. I do not know if the silence is because I am not CC'ing the
correct people, because those people refuse to look at it, or because
no one has any time for it.
</div>
</p>

<p>
From the announcement, it seems clear that Ogness has the patience
necessary to shepherd DazukoFS through the kernel inclusion process.  It
would seem that spending some time working with Eric Paris to try to find
some common ground between their two solutions might be time well spent as
well.

Regarding the problem of writes to mmaped files being problematic to scan whilst keeping them functional -- would it be a reasonable solution to let each file-mapped VMA to get COW pages, and defer scanning and committing the results to the filesystem until the mapping is released?<br>
<p>
This would let most uses of writeable mapped files work unimpeded.<br>
<p>
But it does raise the question, are there any applications that need to use a disk-file-backed shared memory area (as opposed to non-disk-backed objects as provided by shmfs or tmpfs) for interprocess communication?<br>

glibc nscd, for one. (That's how it can be so damn fast: nscd maintains the mmap()ed area, and every user of nscd just needs to yank stuff straight out of the cache, with no IPC as such at all.)<br>

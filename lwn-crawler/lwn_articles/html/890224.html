<h1>Private memory for KVM guests</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 7, 2022</br>
           </div>
Cloud computing is a wonderful thing; it allows efficient use of computing
systems and makes virtual machines instantly available at the click of a
mouse or API call.  But cloud computing can also be problematic; the
security of virtual machines is dependent on the security of the
host system.  In most deployed systems, a host computer can dig through its
guests' memory at will; users running guest systems have to just hope that
doesn't happen.  There are a number of solutions to that problem under
development, including <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220310140911.50924-1-chao.p.peng@linux.intel.com/">this
KVM guest-private memory patch set</a>  by Chao Peng and
others, but some open questions remain.
<p>
A KVM-based hypervisor runs as a user-space process on the host system.
To provide a guest with memory, the hypervisor allocates that memory on the
host, then uses various <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/virt/kvm/api.html">KVM
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls</a> to map it into the guest's "physical" address
space.  But the hypervisor retains its mapping to the memory as well, with no
constraints on how the memory can be accessed.  Sometimes that access is
necessary for communication between the guest and the hypervisor, but the
guest would likely want to keep much of that memory to itself.
<p>
<h4>Providing private memory</h4>
The proposed solution to this problem makes use of the kernel's memfd
mechanism.  The hypervisor can set up a private memory area for its guest
by calling <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html"><tt>memfd_create()</tt></a>
with the new <tt>MFD_INACCESSIBLE</tt> flag.  That creates a special type
of memfd that the creator can do little with; attempts to read from or
write to it will fail, as will attempts to map it into memory.  The creator
<i>can</i>, though, use <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>
to allocate (inaccessible) pages to this memfd.  If the
<a href="/Articles/812325/"><tt>MEMFD_SECRET</tt> flag</a> is also used at
creation time,
then the host's direct mapping for the affected pages will be removed,
meaning that  the host kernel, too, will have no mapping for that memory,
making it difficult to access even if the host kernel is compromised.
<p>

The one other thing that
can be done with it is to pass it to KVM to map into the guest's virtual
address space.  The guest will then have full access to this memory, even
though the host (which set it up) does not.
Enabling this functionality requires setting up callbacks in both
directions between KVM and the backing store (probably shmfs) that actually
provides the memory.  The first set of operations is provided on the KVM
side:
<p>
<pre>
    struct memfile_notifier_ops {
	void (*invalidate)(struct memfile_notifier *notifier,
			   pgoff_t start, pgoff_t end);
	void (*fallocate)(struct memfile_notifier *notifier,
			  pgoff_t start, pgoff_t end);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>fallocate()</tt> function will be called whenever memory is mapped
into this memory range — when the <tt>fallocate()</tt> system call is used
on the host side.  It's worth noting that Dave Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220310230822.GO661808@dread.disaster.area/">objected</a>
to this name, so this callback is likely to end up being named something
like <tt>notify_populate()</tt> instead.  The <tt>invalidate()</tt>
callback, instead, is used to indicate that a range of pages has been
removed and can no longer be accessed from the guest.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
The other callbacks are supplied by the backing-store implementation to
provide KVM with access to the memory in this
otherwise inaccessible memfd:
<p>
<pre>
    struct memfile_pfn_ops {
	long (*get_lock_pfn)(struct inode *inode, pgoff_t offset, int *order);
	void (*put_unlock_pfn)(unsigned long pfn);
    };
</pre>
<p>
KVM will call <tt>get_lock_pfn()</tt> to obtain the host page-frame number(s)
for one or more pages.  When KVM unmaps pages, it calls
<tt>put_unlock_pfn()</tt> to inform the backing store that those pages are
no longer being used.
<p>
This mechanism, along with the requisite plumbing in KVM, is enough to
provide private memory to a guest.  The hypervisor will allocate that
memory for the guest, but will not be able to access it in any way.  
<p>
<h4>Conversion</h4>
<p>
Quentin Perret <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YjyS6A0o4JASQK+B@google.com/">raised a relevant
question</a>: what happens when the guest wants to share some of its
private memory with the host?  This happens reasonably frequently (to set
up I/O buffers, for example), so most solutions in this area provide a
mechanism for the "conversion" of memory pages between the private and
shared states.  Perret asked how that was meant to be handled with this
mechanism.

<p>
<strike>The answer, as <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YkHspg+YzOsbUaCf@google.com/">provided</a> by Sean
Christopherson, is that the guest indicates the desire to convert pages by
exiting back into the hypervisor with a <tt>KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_ERROR</tt>
status.  That status will be passed back to the hypervisor process</strike>
[<b>Update</b>:  Thanks to Paolo Bonzini, we have a corrected version of
this explanation below. ]

<p>
The answer, as <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YkHspg+YzOsbUaCf@google.com/">provided</a> by Sean
Christopherson, is that the guest indicates the desire to convert pages with a hypercall. 
The <tt>KVM_RUN</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> immediately returns with a
<tt>KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_ERROR</tt>  
status to the user-space hypervisor process; if it
concurs with the request, it responds by unmapping the relevant section of
the inaccessible memfd.
That, too, is done with <tt>fallocate()</tt>,
using the "hole-punch" functionality.  The hypervisor can then map ordinary
memory into the newly created hole, resulting in a range that is accessible
to both sides.

<p>
An important thing to note is that sharing pages back to the
host is, by design, a destructive operation; the hole-punch operation will
cause the 
data that was stored there to go away.  As Christopherson <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YkIFW25WgV2WIQHb@google.com/">described</a>, this
behavior matches what is done by a number of hardware implementations;
pages must be shared with the host <i>before</i> being filled with the data
to be shared.  Perret, who is working on <a href="/Articles/836693/">a
similar mechanism for Android</a> ("protected KVM" or pKVM), would rather
have an in-place conversion mechanism available; without that, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YkM7eHCHEBe5NkNH@google.com/">said</a>,
this solution "<q>might not suit pKVM all that well</q>".
He gave <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YksIQYdG41v3KWkr@google.com/">a list of reasons</a>
why that would be useful, including:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	One goal of pKVM is to migrate some things away from the Arm
   	Trustzone environment (e.g. DRM and the likes) and into protected
   	VMs instead. This will give Linux a fighting chance to defend
   	itself against these things -- they currently have access to _all_
   	memory.  And transitioning pages between Linux and Trustzone
   	(donations and shares) is fast and non-destructive, so we really do
   	not want pKVM to regress by requiring the hypervisor to memcpy
   	things.
</blockquote>
<p>
Christopherson <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Ykslo2eo2eRXrpFR@google.com/">questioned</a> the
need for non-destructive conversions, suggesting that reworking pKVM to
handle destructive conversions "<q>doesn't seem too onerous</q>".
Andy Lutomirski was <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/eefc3c74-acca-419c-8947-726ce2458446@www.fastmail.com/">also
unclear</a> on the benefits of that capability, and worried about the
difficulty of implementing it correctly:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	If we actually wanted to support transitioning the same page
	between shared and private, though, we have a bit of an awkward
	situation.  Private to shared is conceptually easy -- do some
	bookkeeping, reconstitute the direct map entry, and it's done.  The
	other direction is a mess: all existing uses of the page need to be
	torn down.  If the page has been recently used for DMA, this
	includes IOMMU entries.
</blockquote>
<p>
Perret <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Ykwbqv90C7+8K+Ao@google.com/">reiterated</a> his
feeling that in-place conversion would perform better, but admitted that he
(like all other participants in the discussion) has not yet collected the
numbers to prove that one way or the other.  He also doesn't have the
details of in-place conversion worked out, though he proposed an outline
for how it could work.
<p>
As of this writing the conversation is ongoing with no clear resolution in
sight.  The developers involved all have an interest in creating a
mechanism that will work for all use cases; there is little interest in
adding several private-memory implementations.  But they all want to also
get the best performance they can while avoiding excess complexity.
Reconciling objectives like these is at the core of system programming
(and, for that matter,
most other types of programming) and is something that the kernel
community is usually reasonably good at — at least, if all of the
interested parties are participating in the discussion.  The developers
have begun to talk so, with luck, a workable
solution can be expected to emerge from this conversation, but it may take
a while yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are two parts in this:<br>
<p>
1) for pKVM (the Arm one) yes, you are. In that case the idea is just that the vendor can see the hypervisor&#x27;s code and trusts it to protect the precious DRM&#x27;d movies<br>
<p>
2) for TDX (Intel) and SEV-SNP (AMD) the guest gets an attestation signed by the processor vendor, and can check that the contents of the memory are as intended and that any debug mode is not enabled. In that case the hypervisor can mess with encrypted memory but that will result in either the host or the guest crashing. That&#x27;s fine because these confidential virtualization mechanisms don&#x27;t promise availability (the host can just decide not to run the guest at all).<br>
<p>
For devices (block, network) the solution is to encrypt all the things and keep keys for the encrypted disk in the initramfs (which is included in the above-mentioned attestation).<br>

I think the simplified version is: The host can&#x27;t emulate the TDX/etc hardware, because that contains a private key known only to Intel/etc. The host could trick its guest into accepting a fake TDX attestation by cleverly patching the guest&#x27;s verification code, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s meant for *remote* attestation: the guest sends the signed attestation report over the network to some already-trusted machine, which verifies it against Intel&#x27;s public key and checks that the TDX hardware says the hypervisor has properly enabled memory encryption etc, before sending sensitive information (e.g. encryption keys for the guest&#x27;s disks) back to the now-trusted guest.<br>

But for 2) the hypervisor could just replace the instructions to perform the check with whatever else places the wanted value into the wanted register no?<br>

      <p>No, it can't, because you're doing a remote attestation protocol.
<p>The protocol described for <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/06wi/finalprojects/bare.pdf">TPM-based remote attestation in this PDF</a> is the sort of thing that's going on, with the TPM role being taken by the processor. The core to stopping the hypervisor from playing silly games is that you don't directly send back the attested value - instead, you use the processor's security enclave as the equivalent of a client certificate in a TLS type protocol.
<p>Because the processor mixes in various details of the guest to the final secret it generates, you know that the guest hasn't been modified - modification would result in a guest certificate that didn't match what you were expecting - and thus you're protected against the hypervisor replacing instructions. In the event that the hypervisor <em>does</em> replace instructions, you end up sending the remote server the "wrong" certificate, and it can identify that you're not a trusted code version - either a known code version that's got security bugs, or an unknown locally modified version of code.
<p>This all, of course, assumes that Intel and AMD have implemented the security parts of their processor correctly, such that attacks like the Spectre family don't work against a secure VM.

The same issue applies to memfd in general as there is no protection against a malicious kernel.  Does it make things more difficult for an attacker? Smart people seem to think so. As a user of public cloud, I would not consider this to mitigate any risk from the hypervisor.  I would consider hardware support for encrypted memory a risk reduction.  However, that would only be for the case where you assume the hypervisor was not comprised before the guest booted. I don&#x27;t see anyway to provide concrete security guarantees against a malicious hypervisor that could be trapping on any special security enclave instructions.<br>

<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2017/">2017 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
When a kernel developer wants to communicate a message to user space, be it
for debugging or to report a serious problem with the system, the venerable
<tt>printk()</tt> function is usually the tool of choice.  But, as Steve
Rostedt (accompanied by Petr Mladek and Sergey Senozhatsky) noted during a
brief session at the 2017 Kernel Summit, 
<tt>printk()</tt> has not aged well.  In particular, it can affect the
performance of the system as a whole; the roots of that problem and a
possible solution were discussed, but a real solution will have to wait for
the appearance of the code.
<p>
The problem, Rostedt said, has to do with the management of the console
lock, which serializes access to the console device where messages are
printed.  <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.13.10/source/kernel/printk/printk.c#L1761">Deep
within <tt>printk()</tt></a>, one will find interesting call sequences
like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (console_trylock())
	console_unlock();
</pre>
<p>
The first call will attempt to acquire the console
lock but may not succeed; the second, on its surface, releases that lock
immediately after it was acquired.
It is the work involved in releasing the console lock that can create
problems for the system.
<p>
<tt>printk()</tt> must proceed regardless of the availability of the
console lock; since <tt>printk()</tt> is called from all over the kernel,
waiting for any sort of lock risks deadlocking the system.  So, if a
particular call is unable to obtain the console lock, it simply buffers its

<a href="/Articles/737823/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/osse/printk-sm.jpg"
alt="[Steve Rostedt]" title="[Steve Rostedt]" class="lthumb"></a>

output and returns, in the expectation that somebody else will flush that
output to the console.  That task falls to the thread that holds the
console lock; that thread is expected to flush out all buffered output as
part of the process of releasing the lock.
<p>
On a large system with a lot of CPUs, there can be multiple threads calling
<tt>printk()</tt> at any given time.  They can leave behind a lot of work
for the unlucky thread that holds the console lock; indeed, in the worst
case, output can continue to pile up while the buffer is being flushed,
leaving the lock holder with a job of indefinite duration.  That is bad for
system performance and the latency of anything that needs to run on the
affected CPU.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra jumped in to say that, whenever this problem comes up, he
just removes <tt>printk()</tt> calls until it goes away.  Andrew Morton,
instead, asked for forgiveness for creating this mechanism in the first
place; it was, he said, something he came up with at&nbsp;3AM.

Rostedt went on to say that, in the worst case, flushing <tt>printk()</tt>
output can take so long that the watchdog fires and the system crashes.  If
there are 100 CPUs in the system, one of them can end up flushing
<tt>printk()</tt> output forever.
<p>
There are, he said, a couple of possible solutions to the problem.  One of
them is to remove <tt>printk()</tt> calls as Zijlstra suggested, but that
is a game of whack-a-mole that is never really done.  The alternative is a
new locking scheme where the second thread attempting to obtain the console
lock spins and waits for it to become available.  The current holder of the
lock will see that there is a waiter and release the lock; the second
thread will then acquire it and continue flushing the output buffer.  If
multiple CPUs are generating output, the lock will circulate between them,
and none will end up printing output for too long.
<p>
Jan Kara said that he had once tried to implement a similar scheme, but he
ran into a lot of special cases and finally gave up on it.  Mathieu
Desnoyers suggested deferring any excess printing work to a workqueue
rather than pushing it out immediately; Ben Herrenschmidt concurred, saying
that there is no real need to flush output right away.  But Rostedt
answered that Linus Torvalds insists that crash dumps must go out
immediately, so any scheme that can delay output will not fly.  The entire
<tt>printk()</tt> buffer must be printed out as soon as possible.
<p>
There was some unstructured discussion on the details of the new approach,
but no real conclusions were reached.  This is a conversation that will
have to resume once the code to implement the new mechanism has been
posted.

I wonder how much large CPU systems need to start dedicating CPUs to certain tasks so that work can continue. <br>

I am sorry CPU1, your job til we reboot is flushing the printks. CPU2 you have to deal with networking and you over there CPU17?.. you got threading. Got it? Good. The other 240 cpus get to work on other stuff this time. What me? CPU0? Oh I am just here to make sure you guys get your work done. Someone has to manage you lot managing jobs.<br>

That’s exactly the thought I had. Without changing the requirements, at such scale you might as well dedicate a single core for flushing buffers. Maybe we can give it a name: kjanitor’s Closet<br>

BTW, a lockup was reported the day after this Kernel Summit discussion that was a result of exactly what I talked about. A lot of CPUs were doing printk() (specifically calling warn_alloc()), and as all sorts of threads start calling warn_alloc() due to memory failing to allocate, the original thread ends up processing all other warnings, and never executes OOM.<br>

Why can't crash dumping use an explicit immediate flush on console, so it is immediate?  With the non-Torvalds mandated printk() stuff get passed off to a worker thread.  If you've decided to crash then you're about to terminate so locks can be over-ridden.   Guess someone will then need a way to flush real error messages somewhere for post-crash inspection.<br>
<p>
Frankly from first impression of Linux in the 90's I was a bit surprised by how chatty it was on boot, in more recent times most of that is hidden to the user.<br>

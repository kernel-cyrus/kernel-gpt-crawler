<h1>The impact of page-table isolation on I/O performance</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 24, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
Ever since <a href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation
(PTI)</a> was introduced as a mitigation for 
the Meltdown CPU vulnerability, users have worried about how it affects the
performance of their systems.  Most of that concern has been directed
toward its impact on computing performance, but I/O performance also
matters.  At the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management
Summit, Ming Lei presented some preliminary work he has done to try to
quantify how severely PTI affects block I/O operations.
<p>
This work was done by running the <a
href="https://github.com/axboe/fio">fio benchmark</a> on current hardware.
The initial tests, running in a virtual machine, showed a significant
impact: a system that could execute just over 1&nbsp;million I/O operations
per second (IOPS) without PTI was reduced to 726,000 IOPS with PTI turned
on.  The situation changes significantly when the test is run on bare metal

<a href="/Articles/752589/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/MingLei-sm.jpg" alt="[Ming Lei]" title="Ming
Lei" class="rthumb"></a>

on the same machine; in that case, a system that could achieve 1,706,000
IOPS dropped to 1,568,000 IOPS when PTI is turned on.  At a little under
10%, that is a smaller impact, but still a significant one.
<p>
It's not clear why performance regresses so severely when the test is run
under virtualization.  There was some theorizing that
<tt>clock_gettime()</tt>, which is called frequently by fio, is not
implemented properly on the guest system, but no real answers.
<p>
Further tests were done using an NVMe-attached drive.  In this case, the
IOPS rates were about the same regardless of whether PTI was being used,
but the system's CPU utilization was significantly higher in the PTI case.

</blockquote>
<p>
Lei concluded from his tests that enabling PTI adds about 0.2µs to the
execution time of every system call.  Normal synchronous I/O operations can
be performed with a single system call, so they slow down slightly as a
result.  Asynchronous I/O operations, as used in the benchmark, require two
system calls — one each to <tt>io_submit()</tt> and
<tt>io_getevents()</tt>.  As a result, asynchronous I/O feels the PTI
penalty more severely.  Interrupts add a similar penalty to each operation
as well.
<p>
Dave Hansen (who did much of the work to bring PTI to Linux) noted that
there was nothing new in these results.  There has always been a cost to
both interrupts and system calls; PTI just makes those costs worse.  He did
note that it was nice to see that the IOPS don't drop when there is
adequate CPU time available, though.
<p>
Block maintainer Jens Axboe said that fio performs three
<tt>clock_gettime()</tt> calls for every I/O operation by default.  So, to
a great extent, Lei's tests were measuring the impact of PTI on system-call
execution time.  Bart Van Assche suggested using the options that reduce
the number of <tt>clock_gettime()</tt> calls, just as the session wound
down.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Historically, KVM’s vDSO clock handling was a catastrophe^Wmess. I don’t remember how much better it is now.<br>
<p>
With some loss of correctness, a guest can force the ‘tsc’ clocksource to get performance back. <br>

Xen doesn't have a vDSO for gettimeofday() so if this was Xen based testing, it will definitely be worse if pvclock is used and you are actually making system calls.<br>
<p>
KVM's vDSO is a lot better these days but still measurably worse than TSC.<br>

Is there more info on what the actual tests were?  The bit about NVMe seems fishy...<br>

<p>
My first thought also was, NVMe should be faster, do more IOs, therefore do more syscalls, so there should be a bigger impact. The following is speculative, as I do not know the test setup, but my explanation is this: NVMe has less CPU overhead associated with each IO. Without NVMe, the bottleneck is the CPU. Adding more load (by slowing down syscalls) necessarily impacts the IO speed. Using NVMe, the bottleneck is the drive (even if its faster) and adding more load to the CPU will only increase the utilization of the CPU, but not decrease IO speed, which is still limited by the drive.<br>
<p>
Probably this would be different, if the CPU would be used by other threads. Then IO speed once more would be limited by available CPU time. <br>

Are slides available to understand the benchmark setup? Some performance loss is expected from KVM since there are effectively three I/O stacks (guest, host QEMU, host kernel). The most recent release of QEMU has a userspace NVMe driver that uses VFIO and can get some more iops, and of course you can assign an NVMe device directly to the VM.<br>
<p>
Another hidden cost is that injecting interrupts is more expensive and adds latency. Fam Zheng will present on storage performance at LinuxCon China.<br>

I only run fio test on null_blk, and there isn't interrupt involved.<br>
<p>
It can be observed that clock_gettime() numbers is ~3X of IO syscall when running<br>
the test in VM, and there are still clock_gettime() syscall observed when test is run<br>
on real machine, but number is much less compared with IO syscall number.<br>

      For a benchmark that uses asynchronous I/O and is not CPU-limited, there may not be a slowdown from slower system calls at all, as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752730/">pointed out by matthias</a>.  The question, as always, is: how representative is the benchmark of real applications.  fio seems to allow different configurations in order to represent different applications, but this transforms the question to a question about the configuration used in the present work.

That is what fio is doing in the setup I posted, and this way may get better latency I guess.<br>

</div>
Over the last couple of years, the amount of testing applied to pre-release
kernels has quietly been increased in a big way; this work has had a
significant impact on kernel release quality.  Two of the developers
behind that work — Dave Jones and Fengguang Wu — ran sessions to talk about
what they are doing and their plans for the future.
<p>
<h4>Trinity</h4>
<p>
Dave's "Trinity" fuzz-testing tool has been around for some time, but the
pace of development has increased in the last year or two.  Dave introduced
himself as the guy who "has broken lots of people's stuff" and who plans to
continue doing so; Trinity, he said, is getting better and growing in

<a href="/Articles/572020/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/DaveJones-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Dave Jones]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>

scope.  From the beginning, Trinity has tried to perform system call
intelligent fuzz testing by avoiding calls that will obviously get an
EINVAL error from the kernel.  So, for example, system calls expecting a
file descriptor will get a file descriptor rather than a random number.
Work is continuing in that direction; the idea is to get Trinity to do
things that real programs would do.
<p>
One of the targets for the future is to add more subsystem-specific
testing.  There will also be more use of features like control groups.
Among other things, these additional tests will require that Trinity be run
as root — something that has been discouraged until now.  He wants the
ability to fuzz things that only root can do, he said, expressing
confidence that there will be "all kinds of horrors" waiting to be found. 
<p>
Dave was asked about using the fault injection framework for testing; he
responded that, every time he tries, he feels like he is the first to use
it.  "Things blow up everywhere."  Dave Airlie asked about fuzz-testing in
32-bit mode on a 64-bit kernel; the answer was that this mode was broken
for a while, but should work now.  When asked about testing user
namespaces, Dave noted that a lot of problems have been found in that
area.  Trinity does not run within them now; it would be nice if somebody
would submit a wrapper to make that work.
<p>
Ted Ts'o remarked on the difficulty of finding the real cause of a lot of
trinity-caused crashes.  Quite a few of them, he suspects, are really the
result of memory corruption left behind by a previous test; the place where
the crash actually happens may have nothing to do with the real problem.
Dave agreed that reproducibility is a problem.  There is a lot that changes
between runs, even after recent work that is careful to save random seeds
so that the random number sequence used will be the same.  It is, he said,
"the number-one thing that sucks" about Trinity, but fixing it has proved
to be far harder than he thought it would be.
<p>
<h4>The build-and-boot robot</h4>
<p>
Fengguang Wu has 63 Reported-by credits in the 3.12 kernel — over 12% of
the total.  These bug reports are the result of the extensive testing
setup that he has been building; he ran a session at the Kernel Summit to
describe his work.
<p>
Essentially, Fengguang's system works by pulling and merging a large number
of git trees, building the resulting kernel, then booting it.  There are a
number of 
tests that are then run, looking for bugs and performance regressions.
When a problem comes up, Fengguang's (large) systems can run up to 1000 KVM

<a href="/Articles/572022/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lce-ks/FengguangWu-sm.jpg" width=125 height=156
alt="[Fengguang Wu]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right"></a>


instances to quickly bisect the history and determine which patch caused
the problem.  The result is an automated email message, of which he sends
about ten each day.  Fengguang noted that a lot of developers send
apologetic emails in response, but, he said, "it's a robot, you don't have
to reply."  Linus jibed that most of that mail was probably an automated
"thank you" script run by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
<p>
Of the problems reported by Fengguang's system, about 10% are build errors,
20% are build warnings and documentation issues, 60% are generated by the
<a href="https://sparse.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">sparse</a>
utility, and 10% come from static checkers like <a
href="http://smatch.sourceforge.net/">smatch</a> and <a
href="http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/">Coccinelle</a>. The number of error
reports going out has been dropping over time, he said; it seems that more
developers are running their own tests before making their code public.
<p>
There were various questions, starting with: which compiler does he use?
Fengguang said that it's <tt>gcc</tt> from the Debian "sid" distribution.
Are any branches excluded from testing?  Those which hold only ancient
commits or which are based on old upstream releases are not tested; any
branch that has "experimental" in its name will also not be tested.
Otherwise, once Fengguang's system finds your repository, no branch will go
untested.  How does he find trees to test?  Mostly from mailing lists and
git logs; as Ted put it, "you can run, but you can't hide."
<p>
One of the more recent changes is the running of performance tests.  These
tests are time consuming, though; Fengguang would like more tests that can
run quickly.  The best performance tests, he said, have a
<tt>--runtime</tt> flag to control how long they run; that leads to
predictable behavior on both fast and slow systems.  He also noted that
both the size of the kernel and the time required to boot are increasing
over time.
<p>
The session ended with general agreement in the room that this work is
helpful and welcome.

really glad to see Fengguang's system works so efficient and useful. This is an idea that lots people want to implement. but doing it for kernel involves so many details and requires strong understanding of the whole system.<br>
good job, dude.<br>

Some more points I noted from Fengguang Wu's talk:<br>
<p>
The robot runs checkpatch.pl but only enables a subset of its warnings/errors.<br>
<p>
It is currently building a total of 200 configurations covering 30 different architectures (aside from randconfig testing).<br>
<p>
Repository owners can opt-in to an email reporting that tests have completed after a git push.<br>
<p>
There is a database of recently detected errors and this is used to de-dupe reports. He plans to provide a way to view all errors introduced on a particular branch.<br>

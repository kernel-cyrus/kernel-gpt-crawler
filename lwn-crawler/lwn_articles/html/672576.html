<p>
It is a little hard to call the "year 2038" problem looming, given that it
is still nearly 22 years off.  But Linux is installed in lots of places
where it may continue running past 2038—particularly in embedded systems.
Kernel developers have done a fair amount of work to address the problem,
much of which we have <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#Year_2038_problem">covered</a> along 
the way.  Attention is now turning to preparing the virtual filesystem
(VFS) layer, along with all of the myriad filesystems supported by Linux,
for 2038. 
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the problem is that the representation of time on a Linux
system—inherited from the original Unix systems—uses a 32-bit signed
integer, at least on 32-bit systems.  It stores the number of seconds since
January&nbsp;1, 1970, which 
is known as the "epoch".  That value will wrap in January&nbsp;2038.
The fallout from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">year 2000
problem</a> was
far smaller than expected, but that was largely a user-space issue.  The
year 2038 problem will affect all existing kernels, so getting ahead
of the 
curve is certainly prudent.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of facets to the filesystem side of the problem.
Filesystems often store timestamps for each file (Unix filesystems store
three), typically in 32-bit formats.  That means those filesystems will
need to change to a larger-sized timestamp at some point, but they will
also need to be able to handle 
today's already-on-disk filesystems with their 32-bit timestamps.  In addition,
filesystems may want to handle on-disk timestamps in their own way, without
converting to the 64-bit timestamp that is being used internally in the
kernel moving forward.
</p>

<p>
The VFS layer, on the other hand, has its own timestamp handling for its
in-memory inodes and other structures.  It will need to change too, but
there are various carts and horses that need to be aligned correctly before
that can happen.

<p>
Deepa Dinamani recently <a href="/Articles/670741/">posted</a> a patch set
that made an attempt at solving the problem in the VFS layer.  Somewhat
confusingly to some, it also included patches for some filesystems to try
to show the scope of the changes needed.  That part of the patch set had
not been compile-tested, which was part of the confusion.
</p>

<p>
But the first seven (of fifteen) patches targeted VFS.  Currently VFS uses a
<tt>struct&nbsp;timespec</tt> to represent time.  That structure suffers
from the year 2038 problem because it uses a <tt>time_t</tt> for seconds, which
is 32 bits on some systems.  It also uses a <tt>long</tt> to store
nanoseconds, which can vary in size as well. That means the structure has a
different size 
on different systems.  The replacement for that in a year-2038-compatible
world is the 
<tt>struct&nbsp;timespec64</tt>, which has a 64-bit seconds field, but
still has a <tt>long</tt> for nanoseconds, so it still will change size between
systems. 
</p>

<p>
Dinamani proposed using a new <tt>struct&nbsp;inode_timespec</tt> that is
defined as a 64-bit seconds field and a 32-bit nanoseconds field
everywhere.  It is mainly introduced to prevent the need for a big "flag
day" patch that converts everything to a <tt>timespec64</tt> at once. 
She added macros to access the fields so that eventually
<tt>inode_timespec</tt> could be turned into a <tt>timespec64</tt>.  The
<tt>inode_timespec</tt> would be aligned so that it only used 12 bytes,
rather than 16 on 64-bit systems.  But Dave Chinner <a
href="/Articles/672595/">called</a> that a premature optimization.
</p>

<p>
As the conversation continued, there was a clear difference of opinion
about how to attack the whole problem.  The memory savings for 12 versus 16
bytes for timestamps in inodes in memory may not be that significant, as
Arnd Bergmann <a href="/Articles/672596/">pointed out</a>.  32-bit systems
will need larger inodes to handle post-2038 timestamps, so it is
really a matter of how much they grow.  Bergmann copied other architecture
mailing lists to see if there were strong feelings about it, but so far
there have been no replies.
</p>

<p>
But Dinamani also wanted feedback on other parts of the patch set.  She <a
href="/Articles/672597/">summarized</a> some of the outstanding questions
that needed to be addressed before the problem can be solved.  Essentially,
there is a tension between the need to move everything to
<tt>timespec64</tt> and how that can be done without disrupting filesystem and
VFS development.  Dinamani sees the transitional <tt>inode_timespec</tt> as
something of a necessary evil that will be eliminated once all of the
filesystems have been converted.
</p>

<p>
Chinner, on the other hand, <a href="/Articles/672598/">thinks</a> that
moving directly to <tt>timespec64</tt> makes more sense.  Both agreed that
there are some preliminary steps that should be taken, such as ensuring
that timestamps are range-checked and clamped to reasonable values on their
way into and out of filesystems and VFS.
There is also the matter of eliminating the use of the
<tt>CURRENT_TIME</tt> macro in filesystems in favor of 
<tt>current_fs_time()</tt>, which
references the filesystem superblock so that the proper time
granularity and range can be enforced.
Beyond that, the approaches diverge.
</p>

<p>
Rather than go through an intermediate inode timestamp type, so that
filesystems can be converted over time, Chinner would <a
href="/Articles/672602/">like</a> to turn that on 
its head a bit.  Start by ensuring that all filesystems that use
<tt>timespec</tt> 
internally call a (for now empty) conversion function to change them to and
from the VFS representation.  That would eliminate all of the macro changes
that were needed when using <tt>inode_timespec</tt>:
<div class="BigQuote">
This works, and is much cleaner than propagating the macro nastiness
everywhere. IMO vfs_time_to_timespec()/timespec_to_vfs_time would be
better named as it describes the conversion exactly. I don't think
this is a huge patch, though - it's mainly the setattr/kstat
operations that need changing here.
</div>

<p>
Internally, time handling in those filesystems could remain unchanged; it
would just be a change at the boundary between the filesystem and the VFS.
That would isolate the changes that need to be done for the VFS from those
that need to be done for the filesystems.
Chinner said that all filesystems will need an audit to determine what they need
to support post-2038 timestamps, so this decoupling is useful:
<div class="BigQuote">
All filesystems will, at least, need auditing. A large number of
them will need changes, no matter how we "abstract" the VFS type
change, even if it is just for 32-&gt;64 bit sign extension bugs.
<p>
Filesystems that have intermediate timestamp formats such as Lustre,
NFS, CIFS, etc will need conversion at the vfs/filesystem entry
points, and their internals will remain unchanged. Fixing the
internals is outside the scope fo the VFS change - the 64 bit VFS
inode support stops at the VFS inode/filesystem boundary.
</div>

<p>
But Dinamani and Bergmann are leery of an
enormous patch set that touches lots of code all over the place.  It is
both "<q>ugly and fragile</q>" as Bergmann <a
href="/Articles/672610/">put it</a>, though he suggested at least
investigating that path.  Both he and Dinamani have made
various attempts to find the right approach and they have both run into
various walls.  Chinner's <a href="/Articles/672612/">suggestion</a> of how
to handle a particular case for the FAT filesystem is not workable, they
said.  Bergmann <a href="/Articles/672613/">elaborated</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
That puts us back at the 'one big patch' problem: We can't change
fat_time_fat2unix() to pass a timespec64 until we also change 
struct inode. The change may be small, but I see roughly 30 file
systems that assign i_?time into or from a local variable or pass it
into by reference into a function that is not from VFS.
</div>
</p>

<p>
So there seems to be an impasse at this point.  Dinamani <a
href="/Articles/672615/">said</a> that she would try to convert an example
filesystem using the two different methods for comparison purposes.
Hopefully that will help point the way toward a solution that leads to as
little disruption as possible.  A change of this sort is always going to
lead to some upheaval, but finding a way to reduce it as much as possible
will be good.  So far, Dinamani and Bergmann haven't quite found the right
approach—or haven't yet convinced Chinner—but it is good to see that kernel
developers are thinking about this.

<p>
New security features can be affected by the "law of
unintended 
consequences", because a seemingly simple restriction runs afoul of
unanticipated interactions with other parts of the system&mdash;often other
security mechanisms.  These interactions can be difficult to spot
immediately, which makes kernel hackers very careful about adding new security
features.  A recent proposal to provide a means for processes to restrict
their network access&mdash;something that would be useful for a process
sandbox for instance&mdash;ran into unintended consequences.  But the
somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the feature, and its tuning for a fairly
specific use case, also caused objections from some.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is fairly simple.  Michael Stone would like to have a means
for a process to reduce its privileges such that it can no
longer make 
network connections.  It would be a one way gate for a process (and any
subsequent 
children) that would restrict network usage to previously opened connections.
Because Stone's use case is for the desktop&mdash;specifically some parts of
the OLPC Bitfrost security model&mdash;there would be an exception made for
connecting to named <tt>AF_UNIX</tt> sockets, which would allow restricted
processes to still be able to talk to the X server.
</p>

<p>
When he initially <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/115744">proposed</a> the
idea in
an RFC in January 2009, Stone took a straightforward approach using
resource limits.  He added a new boolean limit (<tt>RLIMIT_NETWORK</tt>)
that could be set by a process to turn off further network activity.
There was a problem in that scheme in 
that it didn't actually limit the process because it didn't stop it
from using <tt>ptrace()</tt>.  A subverted process
could still do networking via another process by using
<tt>ptrace()</tt> on it. 

<p>
In addition, James Morris <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/777223">noted</a> that
network namespaces might be a possible solution to
the problem.  After that round of comments, Stone came back with an updated 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366393/">patchset</a> in December.  He
addressed the <tt>ptrace()</tt> issue by adding a test for the resource
limit in <tt>__ptrace_may_access()</tt> that would prevent processes that
are network-limited from using <tt>ptrace()</tt>.  He also noted that using
network namespaces didn't support one part of his use case: processes in a
private namespace could no longer connect to the X server using
<tt>AF_UNIX</tt> sockets.
</p>

<p>
Using resource
limits as the interface was not very well received by glibc maintainer
Ulrich Drepper ("<q>it's a pain to deal with
rlimit extensions</q>"), who <a
href="/Articles/368786/">suggested</a> using <tt>prctl()</tt> instead.
Stone quickly turned around <a href="/Articles/368787/">another version of
the patch</a> that used <tt>prctl()</tt>, but a few problems cropped up
along the way.
</p>

<p>
At first blush, removing further network access seems like a harmless way
for a process to voluntarily give up some portion of its privileges.  But,
when coupled with <tt>setuid()</tt> binaries that expect to be able to
access the network, things get murkier.  As Eric W. Biederman <a
href="/Articles/368817/">put it</a>: "<q>You can in theory
confuse a suid root application and cause it to take action with it's
elevated privileges that violate the security policy.</q>"  That is why
privileges are required for entering a new network namespace (as well as
for things like <tt>chroot()</tt>), because they can violate the
assumptions made by <tt>setuid()</tt> programs.
</p>

<p>
Stone is looking for a mechanism that doesn't require a privileged process,
however, which is why he proposed resource limits or <tt>prctl()</tt> as
the interface.  But those don't alleviate the problem with suid programs.
The so-called "sendmail capabilities bug" was brought up several times in
the conversation about Stone's feature as a concrete example of how the
interaction between security mechanisms can go awry.  That bug was really
in the kernel, but by manipulating the Linux capabilities of a process
before spawning <tt>sendmail</tt> (which runs as <tt>setuid(0)</tt>), attackers
could bypass the privilege separation that <tt>sendmail</tt> tries to
enforce.  Adding a new security mechanism (capabilities) suddenly&mdash;mistakenly&mdash;changed the behavior of a well-established security technique.
</p>

<p>
Implementation bugs aside, there are concerns about sprinkling support for
this feature in various places in the kernel: <tt>ptrace()</tt> and the
networking stack, particularly since the 
changes have the <tt>AF_UNIX</tt> exception as a special case.  Alan Cox
<a href="/Articles/368832/">puts it</a> this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
This is a security model, it belongs as a security model using LSM. You
can already do it with SELinux and the like as far as I can see but
that's not to say you shouldn't submit it also as a small handy
standalone security module for people who don't want to load the big
security modules.
<p>
Otherwise you end up putting crap in fast paths that nobody needs but
everyone pays for and weird tests and hacks for address family and like
into core network code.
<p>
The fact the patches look utterly ugly should be telling you something -
which is that you are using the wrong hammer
</div>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, switching to an LSM-based solution opens the "<q>stacking-LSM can of worms
again</q>", as Valdis Kletnieks <a href="/Articles/368835/">calls
it</a>.  Currently, there is no general way to run multiple LSMs
in a
kernel.  The idea has come up multiple times, but there are serious
concerns about allowing it.  Any new LSM is much less likely to be used, at
least in distributions that already use one of the "monolithic" security
modules like SELinux, TOMOYO, or the out-of-tree AppArmor.  In another
thread Stone <a
href="/Articles/368836/">queried</a> linux-kernel on the use of LSM and
expressed that concern:
<div class="BigQuote">
Unfortunately, I don't feel that I can make effective use of these hooks
because they seem to be "occupied" by the large mandatory access control
frameworks.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Smack developer Casey Schaufler essentially <a
href="/Articles/368837/">agreed</a>, but 
encouraged Stone to go forward with an LSM-based solution:
<div class="BigQuote">
You're arguing for stacking a set of small security modules. This
is a direction that has gotten slammed pretty hard in the past but
that crops up every time someone like you comes along with a
module that serves a specific purpose. Mostly the objections have
come from people who will tell you that something else already
does what you're trying to do, and that all you have to do is take
on the entirety of their monolithic approach and you'll be happy.
<p>
I'm behind you 100%. Use the LSM. Your module is exactly why we have
the blessed thing. Once we get a collection of otherwise unrelated
LSMs the need for a stacker will be sufficiently evident that we'll
be able to get one done properly.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are good reasons to be concerned about stacking security modules, but
they mostly stem from trying to combine things like SELinux and TOMOYO
rather than small single-purpose modules.  Serge E. Hallyn <a
href="/Articles/368838/">warned</a> that "<q>the problem is that
composing any two security policies can quickly have 
subtle, unforeseen, but dangerous effects.</q>"  But he also pointed out
that there are ways to "hardcode" stacking with the assistance of the other
LSM developers:
<div class="BigQuote">
So with your module, I'd recommend following the route of the capabilities
LSM.  You can provide an optional stand-alone LSM which only hooks your
functions.  Then smack, for instance, can call the functions in your LSM
from within its own hooks, or it can simply explicitly assign its hooks to
your functions in smack_ops. Selinux can do the same thing, although I
suspect they would more likely implement their own functions for your newly
hooked sites.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While not opposed to that approach in principle, Stone <a
href="/Articles/368839/">notes</a> that it requires others to change their
code, something he has been trying to avoid:
<div class="BigQuote">
Doesn't it seem a bit strange to you to be recommending that everyone else
using the five security hooks I want to use modify their code *in detail* to
support my functionality given that my functionality is explicitly intended not
to require any such work on their part?
<p>
This seems frankly silly to me, not to mention expensive and error-prone.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Another alternative would be to use SELinux to do the restriction as Kyle
Moffett <a href="/Articles/368841/">suggested</a>: "<q>If you aren't using SELinux at this time (and therefore have no
existing policy), then it's actually pretty straightforward
(relatively speaking) to set up for your particular goals.</q>"  He
outlined an SELinux policy scheme to enforce the networking restrictions. Schaufler was <a
href="/Articles/368842/">skeptical</a> of that approach&mdash;while noting
his amusement that an SELinux advocate would call the default polices "<q>fantastically
complicated</q>" as Moffett did.  Schaufler expects the full policy to
support Stone's use case to
be rather complicated itself:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'm willing to bet all the beers you can drink in a sitting that
the policy would be bigger than the proposed LSM. You can count that
in either bytes or lines.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Stone proposed yet another <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/368108/">version</a> that uses the LSM
hooks. The feature is still enabled through <tt>prctl(PR_SET_NETWORK,
PR_NETWORK_OFF)</tt>, but the implementation is done via a
<tt>disablenetwork</tt> LSM.  But there is still the problem of removing
the network for <tt>setuid()</tt> programs that are spawned from the
restricted, unprivileged program.  Some don't see that as a real problem,
because the network could go away for other reasons (network cable pulled,
open file limit set sufficiently low, and so forth), but others like Pavel
Machek, who NAKed the patch, <a href="/Articles/368856/">disagree</a>,
envisioning plausible, if unlikely, scenarios where it could cause a problem.
</p>

<p>
That led Biederman to <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/368263/">propose</a>
a mechanism that would allow processes to call
<tt>prctl(PR_SET_NOSUID)</tt> to permanently revoke their ability to
execute <tt>setuid()</tt> programs (in much the same manner as the
<tt>MNT_NOSUID</tt> mount option).  Any process that did that would then
be eligible to also revoke its network access.  In addition, it would
potentially allow entering private namespaces to become a non-privileged
operation as namespaces suffer from the some of the same issues regarding
<tt>setuid()</tt> programs.
</p>

<p>
But, once again, Biederman's patch implements a security model of sorts,
and belongs in an LSM, at least <a href="/Articles/368859/">according to
Cox</a>: "<q>Another fine example of why we have security hooks so that we don't get a
kernel full of other 'random security idea of the day' hacks.</q>"
Which leads right back to the problem of stacking security modules.  Like
Schaufler, though, Cox seems to think LSM stacking will eventually come to
pass:
<div class="BigQuote">
Yes it might mean the hooks need tweaking, yes it probably means the
people who want these need to do some trivial stacking work, but if as
many people are actually really interested as are having random 'lets add
a button to disable reading serial ports on wednesday' ideas there should
be no shortage of people to do the job right.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem is the whole raft of security mechanisms that Linux
supports: <tt>setuid()</tt>, capabilities, LSMs, monolithic LSMs like
SELinux, securebits (which was mentioned as a possible solution for
<TT>PR_SET_NOSUID</tt>), seccomp, and more.  As the sendmail capabilities
bug showed, these can interact in unexpected ways.  Adding a specific knob,
whether it be disabling the network or <tt>setuid()</tt>, only addresses
that particular problem, while potentially impacting the whole system in a
negative way.
</p>

<p>
It is rather counter-intuitive that allowing non-root programs to
voluntarily drop some portion of their privileges should lead to other
security problems.  The root cause may really be <tt>setuid()</tt>, but
that mechanism is so ingrained into Unix programming that there is
little to be done but live with it&mdash;warts and all.  But there will be
more and more pressure to provide ways for processes to sandbox themselves
(and others).  The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332974/">seccomp
changes</a> proposed by Google for its Chrome browser in May are another
way of approaching the 
problem.  
</p>

<p>
Even with all of the competing&mdash;sometimes clashing&mdash;security
mechanisms, one 
gets the sense that there is more infrastructural work to be done in Linux
security.  If the concern about generalized LSM stacking is only for the
monolithic 
security models, one could imagine some kind of "LSM lite" that used the
same hooks but had restrictions on behavior such that modules could stack.
Perhaps some of these restrictions could be implemented as some kind of
trusted user space daemon that changed the capabilities of running
processes.  So far, it's not clear where things are headed, but it does
seem clear that sandboxing is something that folks want to be able to do,
and that there are some approaches to that problem that Linux does not yet
support.

      I believe LSM stacking *should* be added.  Yes, it can be abused, but anything can be abused.  It would let people create small special-case LSM modules that could be combined with "big" modules like SELinux.

      <p>The topic of stacking has been mentioned a lot in the linux-security list in the last two years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schaufler has been calling for it for a long time, but I remember some core people (Al viro) mentioning possible performance problems due to the increasing number of pointer dereferences in the kernel hot paths.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ofcourse no one offered an implementation yet so that benchmarks can be done, but it seems we're getting closer to this point.</p>

First, let me say that as a sysadmin, I think being able to restrict less trusted software's access to the network (or / and setuid programs) would be a great boon.<br>
<p>
But (and this is a very big but), we need provable security.  What we have with this feature, chroot, setuid, virtualization, etc. is the computing equivalent of security theatre.  Don't get me wrong, it is pretty good security theater... these changes set "bad guys" back months, maybe years until someone learns how to escape the most recent jail or virtual machine.<br>
<p>
We more people to learn about and push for true capability systems that fundamentally tie permission to manipulate an object with the object itself.  The projects I was cheering for (most recently CoyotOS) have fallen by the wayside, while the we all suffer from ACL systems security flaws.<br>
<p>
As a side benefit, capability systems would tend to reduce the 'unintended consequences' issue.<br>
<p>
Note: I'm speaking about the capabilities described here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security</a> and not the kernel capabilities system currently in place.<br>

I've never quite understood the use-case for restricting setuid(). Non-root users can't use it anyway and for root users its use is to *reduce* your privileges, so why would you ever want to forbid it? <br>
<p>
What use I can see is preventing the setuid bit on executables taking effect, but that has nothing to do with the setuid() call.<br>

      Most or all references to setuid in the article are to the permission bit, not the function call. The parentheses are a bit unfortunate.
<p>
That said, the setuid bit and the setuid() function are quite intimately connected: setuid() allows a program to drop privileges that might be elevated by means of a setuid bit. Either one does not make much sense without the other.
<p>
The main reasons why one should consider not using the setuid/setuid() mechanism are that it is not widely understood and not very portable. See, for instance, <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/setuid-usenix02.pdf">this paper</a> (PDF).

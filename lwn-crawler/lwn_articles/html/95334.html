<h1>Voluntary preemption and hardware interrupts</h1>

Ingo Molnar's voluntary preemption work, described here <a
href="/Articles/92806/">two weeks ago</a>, has continued to progress.
Indeed, since Mr. Molnar did not attend the kernel summit or OLS, this
could well have been the fastest-moving kernel project over the last week.
The <a href="/Articles/95332/">2.6.8-rc1-L2 version of the patch</a>,
released on July&nbsp;27, claims a maximum 100&mu;s latency - almost good
enough, says Ingo, for hard real-time work.  One of the methods used may
raise some eyebrows, however.
<p>
The core of the voluntary preemption patch stays true to its original
intent: it adds scheduling points in places where the kernel may hold onto
the CPU for overly long periods.  As kernel testers report problems, Ingo
has been going in and breaking up the offending bits of code.  Ingo has
also added a new knob to control the maximum number of sectors the block
I/O subsystem will try to transfer at once; if block operations get too
big, the IDE completion routines can take too long to perform their
cleanup. 
<p>
That change pointed at a larger problem, however: some interrupt handlers
can, despite conventions to the contrary, occupy the processor for a long
time.  While an interrupt handler is running, high-priority processes
cannot run.  Ingo decided to address this problem head on: he has moved
hardware interrupt handling into process context.
<p>

To do this, he had to change the core kernel interrupt dispatcher.  That
code now checks to see if the interrupt comes from the timer; if so, it is
handled immediately, in the traditional manner.  Otherwise, the IRQ number
is added to a per-CPU list of pending hardware interrupts, and control
returns to the scheduler without having actually serviced the interrupt.


Calling the real interrupt handler falls to the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> process
(which has been renamed <tt>irqd</tt>).  Once it is scheduled, it simply
iterates through the list of pending interrupts and calls all of the
registered handlers for each.  Due to the change in context, the
<tt>pt_regs</tt> structure is no longer available to the handler, but,
since almost no interrupt handlers ever use that argument, that will not be
a problem.
<p>

The <tt>irqd</tt> process runs at a high priority, but a high-priority,
real-time process can still preempt it.  While it is dispatching an
interrupt to its handler(s), <tt>irqd</tt> goes into a simulated interrupt
mode and cannot be preempted.  It drops out of that mode between
interrupts, however, making scheduling possible.  It is also possible for
an interrupt handler to enable preemption at a given point with a call to
<tt>cond_resched_hardirq()</tt> (or one of its variants).  Without such a
call, hardware interrupt handlers will not be put to sleep.
<p>
There are no such calls in drivers in Ingo's current patch - at least, not
directly.  Ingo has also added a new version of
<tt>end_that_request_first()</tt> (the function used to indicate partial
completion of a block I/O request) which allows preemption.  The IDE
completion handler calls the new version, which makes it preemptable - even
though it is an interrupt handler.
<p>

Ingo claims some very good results from this work.  The software latencies
are now all very small.  It would be interesting to see whether the
redirecting of hardware interrupts has any effect on interrupt response
latency, however.  It remains to be seen whether a change of this magnitude
will be accepted - especially since (involuntary) kernel preemption is
supposed to be the real solution to latency problems.  Building trust in
involuntary preemption is an ongoing process, while the voluntary approach
appears to have solved the problem now.  In the end, that is likely to
count for something.

<p>
(Coincidentally, Scott Wood has posted <a href="/Articles/95387/">a
different patch</a> moving interrupt handlers into process context.  His
patch creates a separate thread for each interrupt, which allows the
priority of each interrupt handler to be set independently.  There is also
an <tt>SA_NOTHREAD</tt> flag to <tt>request_irq()</tt> which allows a driver
to request the old, IRQ-context mode.  Ingo has said that he is likely to
adopt the multi-thread approach for his patch as well).<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

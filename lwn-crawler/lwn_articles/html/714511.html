           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 15, 2017</br>
           </div>
The kernel's tracing infrastructure is primarily concerned with events,
which are 
usually tied to the execution of specific blocks of code.  But the
interesting information is often in what happens <i>between</i> events.
The most obvious variable of this type that one might want to monitor is
timing — how much time elapses between one event and another that follows
from it? — but others exist as well.  Options for the calculation of
inter-event values include the use of BPF programs or postprocessing in
user space; a new patch set may soon add the ability to perform these
calculations directly in the kernel instead.
<p>
Tom Zanussi's <a href="/Articles/714001/">inter-event support patch set</a>
is clearly focused on timing measurements.  It is an extension of his <a
href="/Articles/635522/">histogram triggers work</a> that was merged in the
4.6 development cycle.  That work provides a mechanism for the storage of
data from events, but it can only do one thing with the result: generate a
histogram.  This storage capability has the potential for other uses and
can be employed for inter-event tracing, but there are a few problems that
need to be solved for that to be possible.
<p>
The first of those is to arrange for the storage of data from one event to
be used later when 
another event fires.  An example provided with the patch set involves the
<tt>sched_wakeup</tt> event, which fires when the kernel decides that a
sleeping process is now runnable and should wake up.  Consider the
following command:
<p>
<pre>
    echo hist:keys=pid:ts0=common_timestamp.usecs \
         &gt;&gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_wakeup/trigger
</pre>
<p>
This command establishes a special sort of "histogram" (really just using
the histogram mechanism's data-storage capability) on the
<tt>sched_wakeup</tt> event.  The <tt>keys=pid</tt> directive uses the ID
of the process to be awakened as the key with which the data is stored.
The actual data associated with that key is specified with
<tt>ts0=common_timestamp.usecs</tt>.  It 
creates a new variable, <tt>ts0</tt>, that remembers the current time when
the event was fired.  The <tt>common_timestamp</tt> field is also new; it
makes timestamp information available on any event.
<p>
The above records when the kernel decided to wake a process; now it is time
to compute how long it takes until that process actually runs in a CPU.
That time is the wakeup latency experienced by the process; one generally
wants it to be as low as possible and, in a realtime setting, it must not
exceed the maximum the system can tolerate.  The wakeup latency can be
calculated using the <tt>sched_switch</tt> event, which fires when a new
process is given access to the processor.  That is done with a command
like:
<p>
<pre>
    echo 'hist:keys=woken_pid=next_pid:woken_prio=next_prio:\
          wakeup_lat=common_timestamp.usecs-ts0:\
	  onmatch().trace(wakeup_latency)' \
          &gt;&gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
</pre>
<p>
There are a few things happening here, needless to say.  The
<tt>keys=woken_pid=next_pid</tt> fragment takes the <tt>next_pid</tt> event
variable (identifying the process to be switched to in the processor), assigns
it to a new variable called <tt>woken_pid</tt>, and uses it as the key into
the histogram data.  The next fragment, <tt>woken_prio=next_prio</tt>, stores
the priority of the new process in the new <tt>woken_prio</tt> variable.
Things get a bit more complicated with:
<p>
<pre>
    wakeup_lat=common_timestamp.usecs-ts0
</pre>
<p>
Here, the <tt>ts0</tt> timestamp value that was saved in the
<tt>sched_wakeup</tt> event is recalled and subtracted from the current
time, yielding the latency; that value is then stored in yet another new
variable called <tt>wakeup_lat</tt>.
<p>
The <tt>onmatch()</tt> directive in the above command relates to how the
computed latency is reported.  That value is computed from two separate
events and, thus, is not really associated with either of
the events described above, so it should not be reported with them.
Instead, the patch set creates a new abstraction called a "synthetic event"
that is used to report calculated, inter-event values.  In this case, such
an event can be created with a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    echo 'wakeup_latency lat=sched_switch:wakeup_lat \
                         pid=sched_switch:woken_pid \
                         prio=sched_switch:woken_prio' \
         &gt;&gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
</pre>
<p>
This command creates a new event called <tt>wakeup_latency</tt>; three
variables are created, essentially as pointers to variables in the
<tt>sched_switch</tt> event.  One of those, <tt>wakeup_lat</tt> (redefined
as <tt>lat</tt> here) is the calculated latency.
<p>
With that event in place, we can look at the final part of the previous
command:
<p>
<pre>
    onmatch().trace(wakeup_latency)
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>onmatch()</tt> pseudo-function acts if there is a match on the
histogram key (the process ID in this case); when it acts, it will cause
the synthetic event named in the <tt>trace()</tt> "call" to be fired.  That
event behaves like any other event in all respects; it can be read out to
user space or used to create a histogram, for example.
<p>
With the above commands, it is possible to monitor wakeup latencies in the
system.  The command set has been simplified a bit from the original
commands in the patch 
set, which include extra filtering to limit latency tracking to processes
running the <tt>cyclictest</tt> testing tool.  For more details, see the
patch set announcement linked above or <a href="/Articles/714516/">the
documentation</a> that is part of the patch set itself.
<p>
The patch set has seen a fair amount of active review, resulting in generally
positive comments.  It does seem likely, though, that the details of the
syntax as described above will change before this work is considered ready
for merging.  Nobody has, so far, suggested that attached BPF programs
should be used to perform these calculations, though the problem could
conceivably be solved that way.  In any case, for now, the patch set is
being reworked to reflect the review comments received so far; a new
version should be expected before too long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

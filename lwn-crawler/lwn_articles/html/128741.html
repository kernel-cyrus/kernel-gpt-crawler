<h1>Attack of the killer CD</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 22, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
This story starts to get a little tiresome: a security researcher has found
<a href="/Articles/128365/">yet another set of vulnerabilities</a> in the
Linux kernel.  The researcher this time is Michal Zalewski, who, in the
past, has had great luck finding problems by feeding random data to code.
It didn't take him too long to find a few ways to crash the kernel with
corrupted CD images.  
<p>
The impact of this bug is that anybody who can cause a CD to be mounted can
crash the system, and, potentially, obtain root access.  Mounting a disk is
normally a privileged operation, but many systems are set up to
automatically mount a CD (and, perhaps, fire off a file manager window) on
insertion.  Others are set up to allow unprivileged users to mount a CD on
demand.  So corrupt CDs are, indeed, a mechanism which could be used to
compromise a system.
<p>

Of course, it is true that anybody who gets into a position where they can
insert a CD into the system may well find a way to compromise it anyway.
It is hard to defend against an attacker with physical access.  Even so,
there is no point in making any sort of attack easier.
<p>

The bugs in this case are ancient; much of the ISO9660 code dates back to
the early 1990's, and it hasn't seen a great deal of maintenance since.  In
some places, values obtained from the filesystem are not properly checked,
leading to inappropriate memory accesses.  In one other, the check was in
place, but the code responds to a corrupt disk by calling <tt>panic()</tt>,
thus creating a nice denial of service situation.  There's guaranteed to be
other problems which have not yet been found; as Linus <a
href="/Articles/128744/">put it</a>, "<q>The code is a mess.</q>"
<p>

Other filesystems may have similar problems.  An on-disk filesystem is a
complicated data structure, and it can be very hard to defend against any
sort of corruption.  Users are plugging in filesystems more frequently;
many consumer gadgets, such as cameras and music players, just look like
another disk to the computer.  So the opportunities for filesystem-based
attacks are growing.  Expect more patches as more ten-year-old bugs are
found and fixed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Presumably downloadable ISO 9660 images are another attack vector (of the "induce the user to download and mount this CD" variety).<br>

      The attacker doesn't need access to the computer; he just needs to convince the (super)user to mount his CD. I suspect if you can gain root access, you can run a trojan as root from that CD.<br>
<p>
Mounting a CD image, at least, should be something that a user can do. It's the easiest way to handle them.<br>

"""
<p>
Maybe there should be two kind of "mount" for removable devices : the standard one, allowed only to root, and a sort of "user space mount",
which is allowed to users because it is somehow isolated from kernel
and therefore its bugs are less likely to compromise the system.
<p>
Easy to say, hard to do, I expect.

      Don't a few archive tools have ISO support?  I thought FileRoller could do it.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was a KDE kioslave for it.  Then there are some utilities that come with mkisofs, too.<br>

      Ultimately, the issue is based on there being a user who expects to be able to simply add a filesystem anytime they want to add one (cameras, thumb drives, etc).<br>
<p>
This all  sounds more like an administrative issue (e.g., configuration should not allow mounting filesystems with root privileges), and if Linux has absolutely no mechanism for mounting such devices with user privileges, I'd be surprised.<br>

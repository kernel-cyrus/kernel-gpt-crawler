<p>A key tenet in KVM is to reuse as much Linux infrastructure as possible
and focus specifically on processor virtualization. Back in 2007, this
meant a smaller code base and less friction with the other kernel
subsystems, especially when compared with other virtualization technologies
such as Xen. This led to KVM being merged into the mainline with relative
ease.</p>

<p>But now, in the era of microarchitectural vulnerabilities, the
priorities have shifted, and the KVM's reliance on other 
kernel subsystems can be a liability. For one thing, the host kernel
widens the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">TCB (Trusted
Computing Base)</a> and makes for a larger attack surface. In addition,
kernel data structures such as the direct memory map give Linux 
access to guest memory even when it is not strictly necessary and make it
impossible to fully enforce the principle of least privilege. In his talk "Enhancing
KVM for Guest Protection and Security" (<a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kvmforum2019/23/nakajima-enhancing-kvm-for-guest-protection.pdf">slides [PDF]</a>) presented at <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum-2019/">KVM
Forum 2019</a>, long-time KVM contributor Jun Nakajima explained this risk
and suggested some strategies to mitigate it.</p>

<h4>Removing the VMM from the TCB</h4>

<p>Nakajima pointed to three main security issues in the current KVM
hypervisor design: piggybacking on Linux subsystems, the user-space <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">virtual machine
monitor</a> (VMM) having access to the data of the guest it is managing, and the
kernel having access to all address spaces and data structures, including
those from every guest running in the same host. Inspired by
virtualization-oriented memory encryption technologies, like 
<a href="https://developer.amd.com/sev/">AMD SEV</a>, he proposes a
security strategy based on removing as many elements as possible from the
TCB, as seen from the guest perspective.</p>

<p>The first step would be removing the user-space VMM from the TCB. To
achieve this, the guest would use a new KVM facility to specify a virtual memory region
to be shared, while the rest of the memory would be marked as private to
the guest. Any
attempts from the VMM to access a memory region that the guest doesn't want to
be shared will result in a page fault and, depending on the implementation,
potentially send a signal to the VMM.</p>

<p>This implies that the kernel running inside the guest needs be modified
to make use of  the  facility and to ensure that DMA
operations work exclusively within the range of the memory region shared
with the VMM, which can be done using  a software I/O translation buffer
(an swiotlb-based bounce buffer). This strategy 
is already being used for supporting AMD SEV, which allows guests to run
with memory encryption (making it inaccessible from either the host's
kernel or the user-space VMM), and Nakajima pointed out that the intention is to
rely on the existing code as much as possible.</p>

<h4>Protecting guests from the host kernel</h4>

<p>Removing the user-space VMM from the TCB is useful, but it is just the
first step. Going further, and removing the host Linux kernel from the TCB,
requires deeper changes so that the hypervisor can "absorb" the host kernel
and deprive it of its normal full privileges on the machine.</p>

<p>This feat had already been presented (<a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/4/40/01x05-Jun_Nakajima-Kernel_Protection_Using_Hardware-Based_Virtualization.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>) at KVM Forum 2016 and, in the meantime, got the name 
virtualization-based hardening (VBH). As that name suggests, the hypervisor
protects itself from the host kernel through hardware virtualization. Once
the hypervisor has initialized itself, Linux would run in guest mode (with
special privileges) and
the hypervisor could use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Rapid_Virtualization_Indexing">extended
and nested page tables</a> (EPT/NPT) along with an IOMMU to control Linux's
access to 
physical memory.</p>

<p>With this execution model, KVM would be able to provide virtual memory
contexts to guests without relying on the Linux memory-management
subsystem, which would be still in use for servicing both the user-space
processes running in the host and the kernel itself. This way, KVM will be
the only subsystem able to access address space mappings and alter their
properties (including their protection levels), so even if an attacker
happens to take control of some other kernel subsystem, the guest's memory
won't be compromised.</p>

<p>In this scenario, while still far from being an actual <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor#Classification">Type-1
Hypervisor</a>, KVM would effectively hijack a significant part of the
low-level virtual memory functionality from Linux. Of course, this means that the
hypervisor would need to provide its own mechanism for swapping pages, and
define new interfaces to be able to access the actual memory backends (RAM,
software-defined, NVDIMM, etc.).</p>

<p>This strategy shares some similarities with one also presented at KVM
Forum 2019 by Liran Alon and Alexandre Chartre in their talk "KVM
ASI (Address Space Isolation)" (<a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kvmforum2019/34/KVM%20Forum%202019%20KVM%20ASI.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>). In it, they suggested creating a
virtual address space for each guest that would exclusively map per-VM
data, KVM, and the needed kernel subsystems. This is less radical in the
sense that it would still be using the Linux memory-management facilities,
and thus probably be easier to get accepted upstream, but at the cost of
keeping a larger TCB.</p>

<p>All in all, it seems like a consensus is being built around the idea
that it's necessary to rethink the way in which KVM manages the guest's
memory, and its relationship with the rest of the Linux subsystems.</p>

<h4>Going further: removing KVM from the TCB</h4>

<p>So far, the strategies presented were able to remove the VMM
and the host kernel from the TCB. The last step would be removing KVM
itself from the TCB. For this to be possible, KVM must remove guest memory
from its address 
space, including from the Linux direct map. Only regions explicitly shared by
the guests would be accessible to KVM. This is problematic because
currently some operations serviced during VM-exits assume that KVM has full
access to whole guest memory.  VM-exits are performed when the VM returns
control to the host's kernel to handle an operation it cannot perform.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, Nakajima proposes two options. One is to adapt
the kernel running inside the guest. Operations that would trigger
VM-exits, and for which KVM would need to to access the guest's memory,
would be replaced with explicit hypercalls. Alternatively, in order to
run unmodified drivers, the operations could be reflected to a
virtualization exception (#VE) handler. The handler would emulate the
memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)
operations and translate them to hypercalls.</p>

<p>Either of these strategies can be used to enable isolation of guest
memory from the hypervisor. This would be helpful to prevent accidental
leaks and side-channel attacks, but an attacker gaining full control of KVM
would still be able to alter mappings and, potentially, gain access to the
private regions of every guest. A complete mitigation of this risk
therefore requires hardware assistance, like the one provided by AMD SEV
and its successors, <a
href="https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/Protecting%20VM%20Register%20State%20with%20SEV-ES.pdf">SEV-ES
(Encrypted State) [PDF]</a> and <a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lsseu2019/65/SEV-SNP%20Slides%20Nov%201%202019.pdf">SEV-SNP
(Secure Nested Paging) [PDF slides]</a>. This allows the guest memory to be
transparently encrypted in such a way that not even the hypervisor is able
to access it in the clear.</p>

<h4>Proof of concept and performance</h4>

<p>Lastly, Nakajima presented a proof of concept that implements the
ability to remove the guest mappings from both the VMM and the host's
kernel, and gave some initial numbers about the performance impact. For
disk read operations on a virtio device, he measured a 1.2% 
increase in CPU time with one guest, and 1.3% with more than ten. For write
operations, the impact was slightly lower, with 1.1% for a single guest and 1.2%
for the more than ten guests case. For network send operations, also on a
virtio device, the increase in 
CPU time was of 2.6% when running a single guest, and 3.8% with more than
ten.</p>

<p>According to Nakajima, the next step is finishing the proof of concept, and then
sharing the patches with the upstream community. This will probably spark
an interesting discussion in the upstream mailing lists about this and,
possibly, other address space isolation techniques for KVM to protect the
guests' memory from both an attacker controlling the host and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel</a>
leaks.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why would KVM need to duplicate much of the host VMM code to avoid mapping data in QEMU?  If I were implementing this, I would create a private mm_struct for each VM, and I would create VMAs, roughly as usual, that represent guest memory, but those VMAs would be attached to the private mm_struct.<br>
<p>
A naive implementation would have some overhead in that PTEs would be created even though the CPU would never look at the PTEs, although the existing mapping scheme has similar overhead. A future enhancement could add enhance vm_ops.fault, possibly on an opt-in basis, to directly create EPT entries without first creating PTEs.<br>

The article does not explain how the result is actually supposed to be more secure than fixing problems in the common kernel code. Sure the admin of the common kernel has a high level of access. Don’t tell us that the kvm layer admin won’t have the same level of access, because that’s not how admin works (you need access to the things you’re supposed to fix and manage).<br>
<p>
Removing code paths from kernel management does not make them magically more secure.<br>
<p>
Slapping “secure” on your own code implementation does not make it magically more secure.<br>
<p>
See all the stuff that processor companies invented in “secure enclaves and “secure” management processors, that get exploited regularly, and are pretty much impossible to fix/patch in production.<br>
<p>
Coincidentally the same companies are active virtualization-side. I hope this proposal is not just giving up to their usual misconceptions.<br>

Such proposals may be unlikely to be accepted by cloud service providers because it is too subversive, as it is too disruptive and too destructive to existing deployments.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 29, 2008</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers tend to have a mixed view of benchmarks.
A benchmarking tool can do an effective job of quantifying specific aspects
of system performance.  But benchmarks are not real workloads; optimizing
for a benchmark can often distort a system in ways which are detrimental to
real applications.  Since kernel hackers do not always see benchmark optimization
as their top priority, they can sometimes assign a lower priority to
benchmark regressions as well.  But, sometimes, benchmark problems indicate
a real problem in the kernel.
<p>

The tbench benchmark is meant to measure networking performance; it
consists of a collection of processes quickly making lots of small requests
from a server process.  Since the requests are small, there is not much
time spent actually moving data; it's all a matter of shifting small
packets around - and scheduling between the processes.  Back in August,
Christoph Lameter <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=121847986119495&w=4">reported</a>
that tbench performance in the mainline kernel had been declining for some
time.  His system was able to move 3208&nbsp;MB/sec with a 2.6.22 kernel,
but only 2571&nbsp;MB/sec with a 2.6.27-rc kernel.  Each of the releases in
between showed a decline from the one which came before, with 2.6.25
showing an especially big hit.  Others were able to reproduce the results,
and they engaged in various rounds of speculation on where the problem
might be, but it seems that, initially, nobody actually dug into the
system to see what was going on. 
<p>

At linux.conf.au 2007, Andi Kleen gave a talk describing various types of
kernel hackers.  One of those was the "Russian mathematician" who, he
suspected, was often a room full of talented developers operating under a
single name.  Evgeniy Polyakov can only have reinforced that view when, in
early October, he <a href="/Articles/304847/">tracked down the biggest
offending commit</a> through a process which, he says, involved "just [a]
couple of hundreds of compilations."  In the process, he put together <a
href="http://www.ioremap.net/node/37">a plot of tbench performance</a>
which, he says, is suitable for scaring children.  Through a massive amount
of work, he was able to point the finger at a scheduler patch - not
something in the networking stack at all.

<p>

In particular, Evgeniy found that the patch adding high-resolution
preemption ticks was the problem.  The idea behind this patch was to make
time slices more accurate by scheduling preemption at just the right time.
It makes sense; once the regular clock tick has been eliminated, there is
no reason not to arrange for preemption to happen when the scheduling
algorithm says it should.  Unfortunately, it seems that this change also
adds sufficient overhead to slow down tbench performance considerably; when
Evgeniy backed it out, his performance went from 373&nbsp;MB/sec to
455&nbsp;MB/sec.  That would seem to be a pretty clear indication that
something is amiss with high-resolution preemption ticks.
<p>

At this point, the public discussion went quiet, though it appears that a number
of developers were working on it off-list.  David Miller eventually tracked
down the worst of the trouble to the wakeup code, something he was <a
href="/Articles/304873/">rather vocally unhappy</a> about having had to
do.  Eventually a patch was merged (for 2.6.28-rc2) disabling the
high-resolution preemption tick feature.  Since the discussion is private,
it's not quite clear why this change took as long as it did.  But there's a
couple of plausible reasons.  One is that this particular feature is
disabled by default anyway, so most users will not encounter the
performance problem it creates.  
<p>
But there is also the question of weighing the benchmark result against the
effects on other, "real" workloads.  Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/304875/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	But it's a difficult call with no silver bullets. On one hand we
	have folks putting more and more stuff into the context-switching
	hotpath on the (mostly valid) point that the scheduler is a
	slowpath compared to most other things. On the other hand we've got
	folks doing high-context-switch ratio benchmarks and complaining
	about the overhead whenever something goes in that improves the
	quality of scheduling of a workload that does not context-switch as
	massively as tbench. It's a difficult balance and we cannot satisfy
	both camps.
</div>
<p>
So, by this view, performance on scheduler-intensive benchmarks must be
weighed against the wider value of other scheduler enhancements.  David
Miller <a href="/Articles/304876/">has a different view</a> of the
situation, though:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If we now think it's ok that picking which task to run is more
	expensive than writing 64 bytes over a TCP socket and then blocking
	on a read, I'd like to stop using Linux. :-) That's "real work" and
	if the scheduler is more expensive than "real work" we lose.
</div>
<p>
In David's view, scheduler performance has been getting consistently worse
since the switch to the completely fair scheduler in 2.6.23.  He would like
to see some energy put into recovering some of the performance of the
pre-CFS scheduler; in particular, he thinks that Ingo and company should
work to fix (what he sees as) a regression that they caused.
<p>
For the time being, the worst performance regression has been "fixed" by
disabling the high-resolution preemption tick feature; Ingo says that the
feature will not come back until it can be supported without slowing
things down.  But the scheduler seems to have gotten slower in a number of
other ways as well.  Your editor will make a prediction here: now that the
issue has been called out in such clear terms, somebody will find the time
to fix these problems to the point that the CFS scheduler will be faster
than the O(1) scheduler which preceded it.
<p>
Beyond that, there are <a href="/Articles/305092/">suggestions</a> that the
scheduler cannot take the blame for all of the observed regressions in
tbench results.  So developers will have to look at the rest of the system
to figure out what's going on.  The good news is that this is a clear
challenge with an 
objective way to measure success.  Once a problem reaches that level of
clarity, it's usually just a matter of some hacking.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It seems that everything is going slower: ubuntu 8.10 is 20% slower than 7.04 according to 
<a href='http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_bench_2008&num=1'>phoronix</a>:"There was approximately a 20% drop in performance between 7.04 and 7.10 that remained consistent even in the 8.04 and 8.10 releases."

Rather odd set of tests.  There's clearly something bizarre going on with them; *maybe* gcc has started miscompiling numerics code so badly that every CPU bound test really just takes twice as long, but I would think someone might have noticed that.  (The one exception is that apparently the exact same version of GPG got recompiled and went twice as fast, so there's that, I guess.)  What can a distro even *do* to kill 50% of your RAM bandwidth, as they measure?<br>
<p>
The slowdowns in sqlite might be real -- that's probably fsync-bound, and IO scheduler changes might have affected things.<br>
<p>
And finally they conclude that performance has in general dropped off, even though they only measured some odd tasks that most people never wait for anyway.  (Exceptions: the game benchmarks, which were flat since they were just benchmarking the ATI drivers anyway, and a tiny GTK+ drawing microbenchmark.)  There's a reason that "How long does it take to start OpenOffice" is a more common target for measurement...<br>

I did follow the links to the LKML thread on gmane, but I didn't see any discussion about what the problem was that David Miller tracked down.  So I was thinking maybe I just missed it, or it was in a private email somewhere (or another thread - I didn't look beyond the thread). <br>

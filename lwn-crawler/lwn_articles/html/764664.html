           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 13, 2018</br>
           </div>
Linux kernel developers tend to take a dim view of the C++ language; it is
seen, rightly or wrongly, as a sort of combination of the worst (from a
system-programming point of view) features of higher-level languages and
the worst aspects of&nbsp;C.  So it takes a relatively brave person to
dare to discuss that language on the kernel mailing lists.  David Howells
must certainly be one of those; he not only brought up the subject, but is
working to make the kernel's user-space API (UAPI) header files compatible
with C++.
<p>
If somebody were to ask why this goal is desirable, they <a
href="/ml/linux-api/20180905165552.GB25206@kroah.com/">would not be the
first</a> to do so.  The question has not actually gotten a complete answer,
but some possible motivations come to mind.  The most obvious
one is that some developers might actually want to write programs in C++
that need access to the kernel's API; there is no accounting for taste,
after all.  For most system calls, the details of the real kernel API (as
opposed to the POSIX-like API exposed by the C library) tend to be hidden,
but there are exceptions; the most widespread of those is almost certainly
the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
system call.  There is a large set of structures used with
<tt>ioctl()</tt>; their definition is a big part of the kernel's UAPI.  If
a C++ compiler cannot compile those UAPI definitions, then those
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls cannot be invoked from C++.
<p>
C++ got its start as a sort of superset of C, so most C code could, in the
early days, be
compiled with a C++ compiler.  The two languages have diverged over the
years, though, making it easier to write C code that can no longer be
compiled in that way.  A look at the changes in <a
href="/ml/linux-api/153616286704.23468.584491117180383924.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">Howells's
patch set</a> gives some good examples of where things can go wrong.
<p>
One common stumbling point is the use of identifiers that C++ has claimed
as keywords.  The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/drm/i810_drm.h#L268"><tt>drm_i810_dma</tt>
structure</a>, for example, contains a member called <tt>virtual</tt>, while <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/virtio_net.h#L144"><tt>struct
virtio_net_ctrl_header</tt></a> has a member called <tt>class</tt>.  Given
the frequent use of members called <tt>private</tt> in the kernel, it is
surprising that only one (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/keyctl.h#L66"><tt>struct
keyctl_dh_params</tt></a>) seems to have made it into the UAPI.  The C++
compiler gets rather grumpy when it encounters those keywords used as
identifiers, so something needs to change if the UAPI headers are to be
acceptable to it.
<p>
One developer <a
href="/ml/linux-api/20180905125636-mutt-send-email-mst@kernel.org/">suggested</a>
that, for example, C++ developers could be asked to compile their programs
with a 
command-line option like <tt>-Dclass=_class</tt> to sidestep the problem.
It turns 
out, though, that this approach, while it is indeed effective at getting
the structure in question to compile under C++, has a certain risk of creating
unintended difficulties elsewhere in the program.  So a different approach
is necessary.  The solution that was chosen is to change the definition of
the structure to look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct virtio_net_ctrl_hdr {
	union {
    #ifndef __cplusplus
	    __u8 class;
    #endif
	    __u8 _class;
	};
	__u8 cmd;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The addition of the anonymous union allows the old (C++ keyword) name to be
used in C code, while also allowing the addition of a new name that can be
used under either language.  Changing the structures in this way was <a
href="/ml/linux-api/20180905165436.GA25206@kroah.com/">not
universally popular</a>, but there do not appear to be a lot of good
alternatives, given that breaking code written in C is not acceptable.
<p>
There are various other problems to be solved; for example, ending a
structure with an array of unspecified length is not allowed in C++.  So a
definition like the rather tersely named <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/bcache.h#L21">struct
bkey</a></tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bkey {
	__u64	high;
	__u64	low;
	__u64	ptr[];
    };
</pre>
<p>
must be changed by giving <tt>ptr</tt> an explicit dimension of zero.
Other problems turn out to be simply bugs; some structures were defined
using kernel-specific types that are not available in user space, for
example.  In at least <a
href="/ml/linux-api/153616291029.23468.16421004714304578585.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">one
case</a>, the structure involved should never have been exposed to user
space to begin with and had never been used in communications with the
kernel.  Cleaning such things up makes sense even if one does not care
about the larger goal of C++ compatibility.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-api/153616295066.23468.6133013878008690375.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">final
step</a> in the patch series is the addition of a script that will feed
(almost) all of the UAPI header files to <tt>g++</tt> as part of the
kernel's build process.  The output of this compilation is discarded, but
it serves a useful purpose; any developer who breaks the ability to compile
those files under C++ will get some immediate feedback to that effect.
At least, they will if they have <tt>g++</tt> installed; otherwise the test
is skipped to avoid breaking the kernel build as a whole.
Should this series be merged, kernel developers will not necessarily like
C++ any more than they do now, but they will at least be more friendly
toward C++ developers trying to use their exported API headers.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmm. I wonder if anyone has looked at adding compatibility (in the same sense) with ObjC and ObjC++. I think those are easier--it might just fall out naturally from this effort--but it might be nice to check. They're not languages I use, but I do like the idea of increasing compatibility *in general*.<br>
<p>
Basically, I think it would be nice, at a *minimum*, to support any languages which A) can usually directly import C headers (otherwise there's no point) and B) are included in the Gnu Compiler Collection.<br>

Also, the kernel API does not include any external symbols, since all entry points are accessible through architecture dependent mechanisms and the C symbols are provided by glibc. The headers only include structs and constants.<br>

glibc does use extern "C" of course.<br>

      Then you reference it as <code>${"cla\$\$"}</code> from PHP.

I suggested 'klass' because of its use in Python.  Although I see now that PEP 8 advises against it, wanting to add underscores instead.  (A mistake, in my view.)  I picked it up from the old O'Reilly Learning Python book, first edition, back in the day.  Perhaps it is just too old school, or should I say old skool.<br>

As another commenter pointed out: At least in C++, the reserved set is not all names that start with an underscore.  Except in the global namespace, it's "Each name that contains a double underscore or begins with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter...."  So "_class" is not a reserved name outside of the global namespace.<br>
<p>
More importantly, though: Even if it were a reserved name, though, the rest of that sentence in the standard is "...is reserved to the implementation for any use."  The kernel headers are widely understood to be part of the implementation, just like the libc headers, and thus it's entirely acceptable for them to use reserved names.<br>

The article is obviously making a joke.  We don't all hate C++.  David Howels thinks C++ is great and Andrew Morton likes it.  The rest of us think C++ is like Brussels sprouts.  We don't hate it.

You clearly haven't had brussels sprouts prepared right. I used to think I didn't like them, but had only had been served bad ones. Now I would rather have (correctly prepared) brussels sprouts than french fries.<br>
<p>
C++ has had "class", "private", and "virtual" keywords for 30+ years, longer than there has been a Linux. You know that those names were inserted in public-facing headers gleefully to make things difficult for C++ coders.  It is hard to feel sorry for the kernel people responsible, Linus most especially.<br>
<p>
All efforts to make it harder to switch from C to C++ have contributed directly to hundreds of security holes, only a fraction yet identified. Today, it is irresponsible to start a new project in C, or in C-like C++. In modern C++, C idioms that create stupid security failures are unnecessary, and not used. (But you do still need to avoid integer overflow!)<br>
<p>
If you are still avoiding brussells sprouts and C++, it is time to try them again. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised. Coding C++ is, more than anything else, faster than coding C, and the code is always at least as fast, and is often noticeably faster.<br>

There have definitely not been any explicit efforts to prevent people from using C++ with these headers.  It’s irrelevant to those who wrote them.  They haven’t done anything to help either - and that’s been enough.<br>
<p>
A C developer using “private” isn’t even thinking about C++, nor should they be without explicit reason to do so.  (“So C++ can use the headers” is a good reason, but it has to be an explicitly articulated goal or people won’t consider it.)<br>

Thanks for writing this up! The patch series immediately caught my eye. I know some people compile C code with a C++ compiler because C++ corrects at least some of C's warts and can warn about them. The GCC folks also moved to a very limited subset of C++ that would allow them to reduce amount of boilerplate code in several places (and more, I guess?). So I was curious about the motivation :)<br>

      David Howells is also the brave person who bring us the UAPI, see <a href="/Articles/507794/">The UAPI header file split</a>.

Would be nice if the Linux kernel uapi headers would compile even with a C compiler... <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/6/162">https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/6/162</a><br>
<p>
Some subsystem maintainers were really helpful but several not. Maybe it's the generic case of unmaintained subsystems. As so many patches where in my queue and on lkml for years I also kind of gave up on this. I hope the C++ compatibility work proceeds and fixes the many common root causes already seen when compiling the headers with plain C compilers.<br>
<p>
The developer doing this kind of work needs to be a known good kernel maintainer or has at least to have a blessing from one them, or the developer needs to attend and hold presentations about the topic in kernel conferences before progress can be made. I wasn't and didn't, so don't really know how to proceed with my work. Just sending same patches over and over again to lkml doesn't work.<br>
<p>
One of my motivations was to check UAPI headers for ABI breaks between kernel versions and the tooling naturally expects that they would compile: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/lvc/abi-compliance-checker">https://github.com/lvc/abi-compliance-checker</a><br>

           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/576276/">LWN's guide to Btrfs</a>
</div>
This is the second article in a series on the Btrfs filesystem; those who
have not seen <a href="/Articles/576276/">the first segment</a> may wish to
take a quick look.  This installment will cover the basics of finding
the requisite software and getting started with a Btrfs filesystem, while
leaving the advanced features for the future.  Using Btrfs as a simple
Unix-style filesystem is a straightforward matter once the proper tools are
in place.
<p>
The Btrfs filesystem code itself has been in the mainline kernel since the
2.6.29 release in early 2009.  Since then, development of the in-kernel
code has mostly been done upstream, so the mainline kernel contains
all of the code that is deemed ready for use.  
In general, users wanting to use Btrfs for real work are probably best
advised to stay close to the current mainline releases.  Fixes are still
being made at a high rate; it is probably preferable to run the fixed code
than to get a demonstration of why the fixes were necessary.
One can get even newer code by pulling from the <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Btrfs_source_repositories">Btrfs
development repository</a>, but that may be a bit <i>too</i> new for 
anybody who is not actively developing Btrfs.
<p>
The current user-space tools, which handle the creation and management of
Btrfs filesystems, can be pulled from the repository at:
<p>
<pre>
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-progs.git
</pre>
<p>
Until recently, the last "release" of btrfs-progs was 0.19, made in June
2009.  Toward the 
end of November, though, the version number <a href="/Articles/577222/">was
set to "v3.12"</a>, inaugurating a new era in which  version numbering will
be tied to kernel releases.  Btrfs developer Chris Mason noted at the time
that he expected to make btrfs-progs releases with approximately the same
frequency as the kernel going forward.  Since much of the needed work is on
the user-space side, this should be a welcome development for Btrfs users.
<p>
Once again, those wanting to make serious use of Btrfs are likely to want
to run something close to the current versions of the supporting user-space
utilities.  A lot of work (and bug fixes) is going into this code, but one
needs to stay current to take advantage of that work.
Some distributions follow progress in the btrfs-progs repository more
closely than others;  Fedora&nbsp;19 already has v3.12, for example, so
there is no real need for Fedora users to build their own version.  Users
whose distribution does not track the btrfs-progs repository so closely may
want to install their own version built from the repository.
<p>
<h4>Creating and mounting Btrfs filesystems</h4>
<p>
The utility to create a Btrfs filesystem is, unsurprisingly,
<tt>mkfs.btrfs</tt>; it can be invoked directly or via the <tt>mkfs</tt>
program.  In its simplest form, it can be run as:
<p>
<pre>
    mkfs.btrfs /dev/partition-name
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>partition-name</tt> is, of course, the actual name of the
partition that is to contain the filesystem.
<p>
Naturally, <tt>mkfs.btrfs</tt> has a fair number of options, though fewer
than some other filesystems offer.  Some of those that are relevant for
basic usage include <tt>--force</tt> (necessary to convince
<tt>mkfs.btrfs</tt> to overwrite an existing filesystem on the target
partition), <tt>--label</tt> to set a label, and <tt>--version</tt> to just
print out the version number and exit.  One can also specify
<tt>--mixed</tt> to cause the filesystem to mix data and metadata blocks
together.  Normally that will slow things down, so it is only recommended
for situations where space is at an absolute premium; the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkfs.btrfs.8.html">man page</a>
suggests only using it for filesystems up to 1GB in size.
<p>
Btrfs filesystems are made accessible via the <tt>mount</tt> command as
usual.  Like most non-trivial filesystems, Btrfs has <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Mount_options">a number of
specialized mount options</a> that can be used to control its behavior.
Some of these options will be discussed in later installments; a few that
are of general interest include:
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>autodefrag</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Enables automatic defragmentation of the filesystem in the
	background while it is running.  Comments in the documentation
	suggest that this feature is still under development and may not
	produce optimal results for all workloads.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>compress [=zlib|lzo|no]</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Turn on compression of data.  With an argument, it specifies which
	compression algorithm should be used.  The <tt>compress-force</tt>
	option forces the use of compression even on files that do not
	compress well.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>nodatacow</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Turns off the copy-on-write mechanism, but only for newly created
	files.  Turning off COW removes an important integrity mechanism
	and disables compression and data checksumming.  In a few
	situations (the documentation says "large database files") there
	may be a significant performance improvement, but most users will
	probably not want to use this option.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>nodatasum</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Turns off the creation of data checksums for newly created files.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

A mounted Btrfs filesystem feels mostly like any other Linux filesystem.
Every now and then, some differences leak out.  It can be disconcerting,
for example, to delete a large file and not see an increase in the amount
of available free space.  Look back a minute or two later, though, and the
missing space will have reappeared — assuming, of course, that said large
file does not exist in any snapshots.  Btrfs does a lot more work in the
background than many other filesystems do.
<p>
<h4>Other Btrfs tools</h4>
<p>
The btrfs-progs repository contains a number of programs beyond
<tt>mkfs.btrfs</tt>.  One of the more recent additions is the
<tt>btrfsck</tt> filesystem check and repair tool.  The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfsck.8.html">man page</a>
makes the 
newness of this tool clear: "<q>Considering it is not well-tested in
real-life situations yet, if you have a broken Btrfs filesystem, <tt>btrfsck</tt>
may not repair but cause additional damages.</q>"  So users will want to
think hard before running <tt>btrfsck</tt> in the <tt>--repair</tt> mode
and, probably, make use of the "restore" functionality described below.
<p>
The lack of a battle-hardened <tt>btrfsck</tt> utility remains one of the top
reasons why system administrators often shy away from this filesystem.  But
the sad truth is that the only way to really make a truly comprehensive
filesystem repair tool is to observe, over time, the ways in which a
filesystem can become corrupted and come up with ways to fix those
problems.  So <tt>btrfsck</tt> will eventually mature into a tool that can handle a
wide variety of problems, but there are no easy ways to shortcut that
process.
<p>
Meanwhile, anybody working with Btrfs will eventually need
to make use of another tool, called simply <tt>btrfs</tt>.  This tool is
the Swiss Army Knife of the Btrfs world; it can be used to perform a wide
variety of actions on a Btrfs filesystem.  
Thus, unsurprisingly, <tt>btrfs</tt> implements a large number of commands,
many of 
which will be examined in the later parts of this series.  A few that merit
mention now are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>btrfs filesystem df <i>filesystem</i></tt></dt>
<dd>
	Provides free space information about the given
	<tt><i>filesystem</i></tt> with more detail than is available from
	the standard <tt>df</tt> command.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>btrfs filesystem show [<i>filesystem</i>]</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Print information about one or more of the available Btrfs
	filesystems.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>btrfs filesystem defragment [<i>file...</i>]</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Perform online defragmentation of a Btrfs
	filesystem; defragmentation is limited to the given files if they
	are specified. 
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>btrfs restore <i>device</i></tt></dt>
<dd>
	This command will try to extract the data from the given
	<tt><i>device</i></tt>, which, presumably, contains a filesystem
	with problems.  By using this tool prior to attempting to repair
	the filesystem with <tt>btrfsck</tt>, a system administrator can
	maximize the chances of retrieving the data from the device even if
	<tt>btrfsck</tt> fails badly.  See <a
	href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Restore">this wiki
	page</a> for details on how to use this tool.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>btrfs scrub <i>filesystem</i></tt></dt>
<dd>
	Launch a "scrub" operation on the given filesystem; scrubbing
	involves checking metadata and  data against the checksums stored
	in the 	filesystem and correcting any errors found.  Scrubbing can
	take some time, needless to say; it can be paused and resumed with
	variants of the <tt>btrfs&nbsp;scrub</tt> command if need be.
</dd>
<p>
<p>
<dt><tt>btrfs send <i>subvol</i></tt></dt>
<dt><tt>btrfs receive <i>mount</i></tt></dt>
<dd>
	Controls the <a href="/Articles/506244/">send/receive</a>
	functionality, which can be used to replicate filesystems remotely
	or to implement incremental backup operations.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
The basics described thus far are enough to get started with Btrfs,
treating it as just another Unix-style filesystem, possibly with added
compression and data checksumming.  But it's the advanced features of the
Btrfs filesystem that make it truly unique in the Linux world.  One of
those features — the built-in multiple-device and RAID functionality — will
be the subject of the next installment in this series.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I know this isn't a support forum, but I'm having stablity issues with btrfs and I'm wondering how stable it currently is for other people. I have a server that crashes about once a week with an Oops in the btrfs code. This is with the stock Fedora 20 kernel.<br>

It has been fixed in <a href="http://list-archives.org/2013/11/22/linux-mtd-cvs-lists-infradead-org/btrfs-fix-list-delete-warning-when-removing-ordered-root-from-the-list/f/7354102831">http://list-archives.org/2013/11/22/linux-mtd-cvs-lists-i...</a><br>
The fix is in Linux 3.13-rc3, but not in any stable kernels yet.  The bug looks scary to me.  I would not trust my data to the kernels that have it.  Even if it's just memory (not disk) corruption and it's caught early by the debugging code.<br>

Maybe 3 or 4 years ago I put btrfs on a number of our laptops as the root file-system, and it worked quite well. The only real issue we had was the (since fixed) problem where it couldn't create new files at 80% full.  In the years since, I've tried again maybe 4 or 5 times and it's always ended badly.  In my, admittedly limited tests with it, it seems to have been getting less stable rather than more...<br>

It's a very ambitious project, a new filesystem, but somehow Dillon seems to have pulled it off with HAMMER.<br>

I tried to find how to install Fedora (19) with btrfs compression and couldn't figure it out.  I ended up installing it without compression and then adding the mount option compress=lzo to fstab and asking btrfs to compress everything, but that's terrible.  Is there a good way?<br>

I did it in a similar way with one extra step: remount it with compress=lzo right before the package installation begins. It requires jumping to the console VT in the installer.<br>
It sucks and I wish anaconda would support compression, but the current workaround is easy enough for me.<br>

I run VirtualBox on my desktop systems. What are good settings for the partition that stores my virtual disks? Should I use nodatacow? Is compression possible?<br>

 "Considering it is not well-tested in real-life situations yet, if you have a broken Btrfs filesystem, btrfsck may not repair but cause additional damages."<br>

Don't they have read-only mode like e2fsck?<br>

      You have to say --repair before it will try to change things.

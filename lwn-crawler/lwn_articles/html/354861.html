<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/339337/">Soft updates</a>, a method of
maintaining on-disk file system consistency through carefully ordering
writes to disk, have only been implemented once in a production operating
system (FreeBSD).  You can argue about exactly why they have not been
implemented elsewhere, and in Linux in particular, but my theory is that
not enough file systems geniuses exist in the world to write and maintain
more than one instance of soft updates.  <a
href="http://www.frostnet.net/chris/">Chris Frost</a>, a graduate student
at UCLA, agrees with the too-complicated-for-mere-mortals theory.  That's
why in 2006, he and several co-conspirators at UCLA wrote the <a
href="http://featherstitch.cs.ucla.edu/">Featherstitch</a> system for
keeping on-disk data consistent.

<p>

Featherstitch is a generalization of the soft updates system of write
dependencies and rollback data.  The resulting system is general
enough that most (possibly all) other file system consistency strategies
(e.g., journaling) can be efficiently implemented on top of the
Featherstitch interface.  What makes Featherstitch unique among file
systems consistency techniques is that it exports a safe, efficient,
non-blocking mechanism to userland applications that lets them group
and order writes without using <code>fsync()</code> or relying on file
system-specific behavior (like ext3 <code>data=ordered</code> mode).
<p>

<h4>Featherstitch basics: patches, dependencies, and undo data</h4>

What is Featherstitch, other than something file system aficionados
throw in your face whenever you complain about soft updates being too
complicated?  Featherstitch grew out of soft updates and has a lot in
common with that approach architecturally.  The main difference between
Featherstitch and soft updates is that the latter implements each
file system operation individually with a different specialized set of
data structures specific to the FFS file system, while Featherstitch
generalizes the concept of a set of updates to different blocks and
creates one data structure and write-handling mechanism shared by all
file system operations.  As a result, Featherstitch is easier to
understand and implement than soft updates.
<p>

Featherstitch records all changes to the file system in "patches" (the
dearth of original terminology in software development strikes again).
A patch includes the block number, a linked list of patches that this
patch depends on, and the "undo data."  The undo data is a byte-level
diff of the changes made to this block by this patch, including the
offset, length, and contents of the range of bytes overwritten by this
change.  Another version of a patch is optimized for bit-flip changes,
like those made to block bitmaps.  The rule for writing patches out to
storage is simple: If any of the patches this patch depends on - its
dependencies - aren't confirmed to be written to disk, this patch
can't be written yet.
<p>

In other words, patches and dependencies look a lot like a generic
directed acyclic graph (DAG), with patches as the circles and
dependencies as the arrows.  If you are a programmer, you've probably
drawn hundreds or thousands of these pictures in your life.  Just
imagine a little diff hanging off each circle and you've got a good
mental model for thinking about Featherstitch.  The interesting bits
are around reducing the number of little circles - in the first
implementation, the memory used by Featherstitch undo data was often
twice that of the actual changes written to disk.
For example, untarring a 220MB kernel source tree
allocated about 460MB of undo data.
<p>

The acyclic-ness of Featherstitch patch dependencies deserves a little
more attention.  It is the caller's responsibility to avoid creating
circular patch dependencies in the first place; Featherstitch doesn't
detect or attempt to fix them. (The simplified interface exported to
userspace makes cycles impossible to create in the first place, more
about that later.) However, lack of circular dependencies among
patches does not imply a lack of circular dependencies between blocks.
Patches are a record of a change to a block and each block can have
multiple outstanding patches against it.  Imagine a patch dependency,
patch A depends on patch B, which depends on patch C.  That
is, <code>A-&gt;B-&gt;C</code>, where "<code>-&gt;</code>" reads as "depends
on."  If patch A applies to block 1, and patch B applies to block 2,
and patch C applies to block 1, then viewing the blocks and their
outstanding patches as a whole, you have a circular dependency where
block 1 must be written before block 2, but block 2 must also be
written before block 1.  This is called a "block-level cycle" and it
causes most of the headaches in a system based on write ordering.
<p>

The way both soft updates and Featherstitch resolve block level cycles is
by keeping enough information about each change to roll it back.  When it
comes time to write a block, any applied patches which can't be written yet
(because their dependencies haven't been written yet) are rolled back using
their undo data.  In our example, with <code>A-&gt;B-&gt;C</code> and A and
C both applied to block 1, we would roll back A on block 1, write block 1
with patch C applied, write B's block, and then write block 1 a second time
with both patch A and C applied.  <p>

<h4>Optimization</h4>

The first version of Featherstitch was elegant, general purpose, easy
to understand, and extraordinarily inefficient.  On several
benchmarks, the original implementation allocated over twice as much
memory for patches and undo data as needed for the actual new data
itself.  The system became CPU-bound with as few as 128 blocks in the
buffer cache.
<p>


<p>

The first goal was to reduce the number of patches needed to complete
an operation.  In many cases, a patch will never be reverted - for
example, if we write to a file's data block when no other writes are
outstanding on the file system, then there is no reason we'd ever have
to roll back to the old version of the block.  In this case,
Featherstitch creates a "hard patch" - a patch that doesn't keep any
undo data.  The next optimization is to merge patches when they can
always be written together without violating any dependencies.  A
third optimization merges overlapping patches in some cases.  All of
these patch reduction techniques hinge on the Featherstitch rules for
creating patches and dependencies, in particular that a patch's
dependencies must be specified at creation time.  Some opportunities
for merging can be detected at patch creation time, others when a
patch commits and is removed from the queue.
<p>

The second major goal was to efficiently find patches ready for
writing.  A normal buffer cache holds several hundred thousand blocks,
so any per-block data structures and algorithms must be extremely
efficient.  Normally, the buffer cache just has to, in essence, walk a
list of dirty blocks and issue writes on them in some reasonably
optimal manner.  With Featherstitch, it can find a dirty block, but
then it has to walk its list of patches checking to see if there is a
subset whose dependencies have been satisfied and are therefore ready
for writing.  This list can be long, and it can turn out that none of
the patches are ready, in which case it has to give up and go on to
the next patch.  Rather than randomly searching in the cache,
Featherstitch instead keeps a list of patches that are ready to be
written.  When a patch has committed, the list of patches that
depended on it is traversed and newly ready patches added to the list.
<p>

With these optimizations, the memory overhead of Featherstitch dropped
from 200+% to 4-18% in the set of benchmarks used for evaluation -
still high, but in the realm of practicality.  The optimizations
described above were only partially implemented in some cases, leaving
more room for improvement without any further insight.
<p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

For head-to-head performance comparisons, the authors implemented
several versions of file system consistency using the Featherstitch
patch interface and compared them to the ext2 and ext3 equivalents.
Using ext2 as the on-disk file system format, they re-implemented soft
updates, metadata-only journaling, and full data/metadata journaling.
Metadata-only journaling corresponds to
ext3's <code>data=writeback</code> mode (file data is written without
regard to the state of file system metadata that refers to it) and
full journaling corresponds to ext3's <code>data=full</code> mode (all
file data is written directly to the journal along with file system
metadata).
<p>

The benchmarks used were extraction of a ~200MB tar file (the kernel
source code, natch), deletion of the results of previous, a Postmark
run, and a modified Andrew file system benchmark - in other words, the
usually motley crew of terrible, incomplete, unrepresentative file
system benchmarks we always run because there's nothing better
available.  The deficiency shows: under this workload, ext3 performed
about the same in <code>data=writeback</code>
and <code>data=ordered</code> mode (not usually the case in real-world
systems), which is one of the reasons the authors didn't implement
ordered mode for Featherstitch.  The overall performance result was
that the Featherstitch implementations were at par or somewhat better
with the comparable ext3 version for elapsed time, but used
significantly more CPU time.
<p>

<h4>Patchgroups: Featherstitch for userspace</h4>

So, you can use Featherstitch to re-implement all kinds of file system
consistency schemes - soft updates, copy-on-write, journaling of all
flavors - and it will go about as fast the old version while using up
more of your CPU.  When you have big new features like checksums and
snapshots in btrfs, it's hard to get excited about an under-the-covers
re-implementation of file system internals.  It's cool, but no one but
file systems developers will care, right?
<p>

In my opinion, the most exciting application of Featherstitch is not
in the kernel, but userland.  In short, Featherstitch exports an
interface that applications can use to get the on-disk consistency
results they want, AND keep most of the performance benefits that come
with re-ordering and delaying writes.  Right now, applications have
only two practical choices for controlling the order of changes to the
file system: Wait for all writes to a file to complete using fsync(),
or rely on file system-specific implementation details, like
ext3 <code>data=ordered</code> mode.  Featherstitch gives you a third
option: Describe the exact, minimal ordering relationship between
various file system writes and then let the kernel re-order, delay,
and otherwise optimize the writes as much possible within those
constraints.
<p>

The userland interface is called "patchgroups."  The interface
prevents the two major pitfalls that usually accompany exporting a
kernel-level consistency mechanism to userspace.  First, it prevents
deadlocks caused by dependency cycles ("Hey, kernel!  Write A depends
on write B!  And, oh yeah, write B depends on write A!  Have a nice
day!").  In the kernel, you can define misuse of the interface as a
kernel bug, but if an application screws up a dependency, the whole
kernel grinds to a halt.  Second, it prevents applications from
stalling their own or other writes by opening a transaction and
holding it open indefinitely while it adds new changes to the
transaction (or goes off into an infinite loop, or crashes, or
otherwise fails to wrap up its changes in a neat little bow).
<p>

The patchgroups interface simply says that all of those writes over
there must be on-disk before any of these writes over here can start
being written to disk.  Any other writes that happen to be going on
outside of these two sets can go to disk in any order they please, and
the writes inside each set are not ordered with respect to each other
either.  Here's a pseudo-code example of using patchgroups:

<pre>
    /* Atomic update of a file using patchgroups */

    /* Create a patch group to track the creation of the new copy of the file */
    copy_pg = pg_create();

    /* Tell it to track all our file systems changes until pg_disengage() */
    pg_engage(copy_pg);

    /* Open the source file, get a temporary filename, etc. */

    /* Create the temp file */
    temp_fd = creat();

    /* Copy the original file data to the temp file and make your changes */

    /* All changes done, now wrap up this patchgroup */
    pg_disengage(copy_pg);
</pre>
<p>

The temp file now contains the new version of the file, and all of
the related file system changes are part of the current patchgroup.
Now we want to put the following <tt>rename()</tt> in a separate patchgroup
that depends on the patchgroup containing the new version of the
file.
<p>
<pre>
    /* Start a new patchgroup for the rename() */
    rename_pg = pg_create();
    
    pg_engage(rename_pg);

    /*
     * MAGIC OCCURS HERE: This is where we tell the system that the
     * rename() can't hit disk until the temporary file's changes have
     * committed.  If you don't have patchgroups, this is where you would
     * fsync() instead.  fsync() can also be thought of as:
     *
     * pg_depend(all previous writes to this file, this_pg);
     * pg_sync(this_pg);
     */

    /* This new patchgroup, rename_pg, depends on the copy_pg patchgroup */
    pg_depend(copy_pg, rename_pg);

    /* This rename() becomes part of the rename_pg patchgroup */
    rename();

    /* All set! */
    pg_disengage(rename_pg);

    /* Cleanup. */
    pg_close(copy_pg);
    pg_close(rename_pg);
</pre>

Short version: No more
"<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328363/">Firefox
<code>fsync()</code></a>" bug, O_PONIES for 
everyone who wants them and very little cost for those who don't.
<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Featherstitch is a generalization and simplification of soft updates,
with reasonable, but not stellar, performance and overhead.
Featherstitch really shines when it comes to exporting a useful, safe
write ordering interface for userspace applications.  It replaces the
enormous performance-destroying hammer of <code>fsync()</code> with a
minimal and elegant write grouping and ordering mechanism.
<p>

When it comes to the Featherstitch paper itself, I highly recommend
reading the entire paper simply for the brief yet accurate summaries
of complex storage-related issues.  Sometimes I feel like I'm reading
the distillation of three hours of the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">Linux
Storage and File Systems Workshop</a> plus another couple of weeks of
mailing list discussion, all in one paragraph.  For example, section 7
describes, in a most extraordinarily succinct manner, the options for
correctly flushing a disk's write cache, including specific commands,
both SCSI and ATA, and a brief summary of the quality of hardware
support for these commands.

The pg_* calls look like a great way for apps to specify exactly what they want from the filesystem.  I wonder to what extent it's possible to provide them on plain vanilla filesystems without Featherstitch.  For example, on minixfs almost every pg_* call would just do sync() or fsync(); on ext3 it would be either fsync() or a no-op depending on whether data=ordered already provides the necessary guarantees; and so on.  Then apps could start using the rich interface now, even if the kernel is at the moment a bit stupid and does things slower than it could.  Over time, the kernel can be optimized to provide the same guarantees but faster.<br>

i.e. time to write a trivial wrapper library? Maybe, but let's get the names right first: pg_*() is pretty awful: it doesn't say 'disk writes' to me at all, it says 'PostgreSQL'!<br>
<p>
writegroup_*() might be better but is a bit long. wg_*() is shorter but somewhat opaque...<br>

Ooh! A bikeshed with peeling paint!<br>
<p>
How about batch_*()? Or wb_*() for writebatch? (I'm ignoring the "patch" word, since I find it far more confusing than enlightening.)<br>
<p>
Will it always be write-specific? Would it ever be useful to say something like "read blocks A-D, but I'll need either both A and B or both C and D before I can make progress"? Something to do with RAID parity blocks, or quasi-realtime processing using memory that needs to be pinned but only while the process is scheduled or starts a pass, or maybe (ooh, here's a confusing one) when you want to read data from in-progress writes that are themselves being controlled by a dependency DAG? Or heck, maybe you're trying to read off of multiple devices and you only have enough power to spin up a subset at a time.<br>
<p>
I guess I'm just making up bullshit.<br>
<p>
Mmm. Bullshit and bikesheds. They go so well together, like chocolate and peanut butter. If you'll excuse the juxtaposition.<br>

Quite so, this is really silly :) I'd recommend against using prefixes <br>
like 'batch_*()' in available-everywhere interfaces, though, 'cos it's the <br>
sort of prefix that batch-processing systems are *certain* to be using <br>
already.<br>

Might this lead to full filesystem transactions someday?<br>
<p>
NTFS in Vista supports some transactional operations (the ones which are easy to implement) and it really helps sometimes. <br>
<p>
One can run a distributed transaction with database and filesystem as XA datasources. For example, I use it in a document management system - XA transactions guarantee that document data and metadata in the database are always in sync.<br>

      ZFS also has a transactional engine (DMU) underneath, although it's not exposed to user space.

Wow,it's really hard to keep reading an article when the very first sentence in it is plainly wrong.  Soft updates have been implemented in NetBSD, DragonflyBSD and OpenBSD, not just FreeBSD. <br>

This might be a difference in the use of the word "implemented" - I believe (and do correct me if I'm wrong) that soft updates were designed and written once, for FreeBSD, and then the code was inherited to the other BSDs.  But I can see this being interpreted as "exists and works in a production operating system" in which case I would have to list all FreeBSD descended operating systems.<br>
<p>
Anyway, please do let me know if soft updates were re-implemented independently at any point.  The only instance I know of is the Featherstitch-based re-implementation described in this article.<br>

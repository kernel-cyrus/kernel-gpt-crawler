<h1>A bid to resurrect Linux capabilities</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted September 10, 2006 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Back in 1998, as the 2.1 kernel went into yet another feature freeze, the
capabilities feature was merged.  Capabilities split the power of the root
account into a set of privileges, each of which can be granted or withheld
independently of the others.  A process which needs to be able to bind to a
privileged port number, for example, could be given that ability without
simultaneously enabling it to override file permissions, kill other
processes, or exceed resource limits.  Proponents of capabilities have long
seen a world where the root account no longer exists and all tasks have the
minimum level of privilege they need to get their jobs done.  A system
organized in this way, it is thought, would be more secure.
<p>
The world is full of Linux distributions, many of which are oriented toward
higher levels of security.  But, to your editor's knowledge, nobody has
ever put together a successful, capability-based distribution.  There are
many reasons for this lack of implementations, including the fact that
nobody has really figured out a way to administer a system with a couple
dozen more security-related bits attached to every executable file.  But
one should also not overlook the fact that, from the 2.1.x days to
now, there has never been a Linux kernel where capabilities actually worked
as intended.
<p>

Part of the problem is an incomplete implementation: no patch which
attaches capability masks to files has ever been merged.  But the kernel
has also never implemented capability inheritance - what happens to the
capability bits when a process executes a new program - in a correct
manner.  For some time now, in fact, capability inheritance has been
disabled completely.  Without inheritance, the full capability model cannot
work.  So the use of capabilities in Linux systems has been limited to a
very small number of programs which have been coded to drop the
capabilities they do not need.
<p>

David Madore has set out to change that state of affairs with <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/198977/">a set of patches</a> to fix up
capability support.  This patch set does a few things, the first of which
being to expand the capability set from 32 to 64 bits.  Current kernels
have 31 capabilities defined, so it is not especially hard to imagine
needing more in the future.  That need could become pressing if anybody
ever gets serious about splitting the catch-all <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>
capability into several smaller privileges.
<p>

This patch uses some of those new bits from the outset for a set of
"regular capabilities" which all processes are normally expected to have.  These
capabilities include the ability to use <tt>fork()</tt> or <tt>exec()</tt>,
the ability to open files and to write to files, the ability to use
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, and the ability to increase privilege by running a
setuid program.  The idea here is that processes running in
security-relevant settings can drop those capabilities if they are not
needed, making it harder to exploit any vulnerabilities in those
processes. 
<p>

The core of the patch, however, is the implementation of capability
inheritance.  Understanding this part requires just a bit of background.
As it happens, while one can talk about the capabilities possessed by a
process, each process in Linux has three separate capability masks.  The
<b>permitted</b> set is all of the capabilities that the process is allowed
to have.  But capabilities cannot be used unless they are set in the
<b>effective</b> set, is a subset of the permitted set.
Finally, each process has an <b>inheritable</b> set, listing the
capabilities (again, a subset of the permitted set) which can be passed on
to any program run with <tt>exec()</tt>.  Processes can adjust the
effective and inheritable sets at any time (within the bounds of the
permitted set), but the permitted set cannot be expanded.
<p>

In a capability-based system, executable files also have a set of three
capability masks.  Those masks have the same names as the process masks,
and their function is almost the same.  The file's inherited mask, however,
will 
limit the capabilities which can be inherited from any other process.
David's patch set includes a patch (by Serge Hallyn) which adds support for
capability masks to the filesystem layer.
<p>

When a process runs a new executable, the masks are combined as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>P&prime;<sub>p</sub> &larr;
(P<sub>i</sub> &cap; F<sub>i</sub>) &cup;
(F<sub>p</sub> &cap; bnd)</li>
<p>
<li>P&prime;<sub>e</sub> &larr;
(P<sub>i</sub> &cap; P<sub>e</sub> &cap; F<sub>i</sub>) &cup;
(F<sub>p</sub> &cap; F<sub>e</sub> &cap; bnd)</li>
<p>
<li>P&prime;<sub>i</sub> &larr; P&prime;<sub>p</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>
These equations are taken directly from <a
href="http://www.madore.org/~david/linux/newcaps/">David's "new
capabilities" page</a>, which has much more detail on all of this work.
What they say, in English, is something like this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The permitted capabilities for the new executable
     (P&prime;<sub>p</sub>) are the intersection of the inheritable set from
     process before calling <tt>exec()</tt> (P<sub>i</sub>) and the
     file's inherited set (F<sub>i</sub>).  The permitted set from the file
     (F<sub>p</sub>) is then added in, but not before being limited by the
     system-wide <a href="http://lwn.net/1999/1202/kernel.php3">capability
     bounding set</a>.
<p>
<li> The effective capabilities (P&prime;<sub>e</sub>) will be the same as
     the inherited capabilities, except that capabilities which are not
     effect in the current process or in the file's effective set will be
     masked out.
<p>
<li> The inheritable capabilities (P&prime;<sub>i</sub>) will be the same
     as the permitted capabilities.
</ul>
<p>
For the most part, these rules match the usual understanding of how
capability-based systems are supposed to work.  Capabilities, in such a
system, are assigned to programs, not to users; the normal permissions bits
can then come into play to control which programs specific users can run.
<p>
David's patch differs from the usual idea of capability-based systems in
one important regard, however: how it handles programs with no capability
sets defined.  On most systems, that will be almost every executable file
there is.  By the rules, such programs should be treated as having an empty
inherited set, which, by the rules above, would cause them to be run with
no capabilities at all.  David's patch, instead, causes these programs to
be run with the same capabilities the process had before - though the
presence of things like setuid bits can obviously change that calculation.
This interpretation breaks the classic capability-based model, but it has
the advantage of actually working on current systems.
<p>
Ted T'so, however, <a href="/Articles/199007/">complains</a> that this
compromise fundamentally weakens the security of the capability-based
model.  He has suggested that the behavior be configurable, with each
filesystem having a flag describing how capabilities should be handled in
the absence of a set per-file masks.  A set of default capabilities for new
files could be part of this change as well.
<p>

The other complaint which has been heard is fairly predictable:
why, it is asked, should we bother with capabilities when SELinux can do
all of the same things and more?  In fact, SELinux does something vaguely
similar, but with a level of indirection; it attaches labels to files, then
associates capabilities with the labels through the policy mechanism.
Anybody who has ever gotten that cheery Fedora "your filesystem must be
relabeled, please wait for a very long time" boot message knows that
keeping files and labels properly synchronized is a difficult task.  There
is no real reason to believe that keeping capability masks in a correct
state would be any easier.  That fact alone may continue to limit the real
usage of capabilities well into the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Well, a capability-based system would have no trouble keeping anything in sync with the capability masks on files, because there *is* nothing to keep in sync. The relabelling operation consists (very roughly) of tracking down the xattrs on labelled files and bringing them in sync with what's defined in the SELinux config files: no analogous operation exists if xattrs are the only storage representation, just as you don't need to wait for ages while permissions are synched with anything when you boot :)<br>
<p>
(The interaction of all this with Samba and NFS-without-xattrs is interesting: the standard capability inheritance model is totally broken in that situation. Mind you it's quite rare to run binaries over NFS these days.)<br>

      <blockquote>Mind you it's quite rare to run binaries over NFS these days.</blockquote>
I don't agree with that opinion. A common use of NFS is to provide netwide home directories. If a user installs any program privately, or if she develops programs, executables will be run from this NFS share. And IMNSHO this scenario is not "quite rare".

      I'm not sure I agree with the premise that no Linux distribution has shipped with active capabilities support, or that current capabilities support is inherently unusable due to the lack of inheritance.<br>
<p>
For many years, I've used the highly-secure EngardeLinux distribution from Guardian Digital, which shipped with LIDS (<a href="http://www.lids.org">http://www.lids.org</a>) installed and enabled by default. Now, LIDS development is mostly bug-fixing at this point -- it's not pushing cutting edge features. However, for a manageable Mandatory Access Control system utilizing capabilities, it's quite nice. Like SELinux, it uses centralized ACL configuration rather than file attributes, which makes it a better fit for distributions than for package owners (See, e.g. AppArmor, as a solution that enables each package to ship its own ACLs).<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>

      <p>I've always wondered why the security conscious world hasn't paid more attention to using Linux capabilities.  People go to great lengths to change UID and re-exec things and create setuid helper programs and such to reduce the amount of code that has privilege, but Linux capabiities do the same thing (by design, that is) and get ignored.
<p>
I liked the idea so much for protecting my own systems that I made a few small fixes to Linux 2.4 years ago to make capabilities work, wrote the missing administration tools for them, and have used them extensively.  Hardly anything runs as superuser on my systems.
<p>
For the missing setuid function (attaching capabilities to files), I used an idea that was posted in a comment to an LWN article on the topic a few years ago:  Rather than mess with exec and filesystem code, I wrote a simple executable interpreter (those are modular in Linux; the ELF interpreter is one example).   Execing a privilege-raising program is two steps: user execs a setuid file which is in "capx" format, and that file sets proper capabilities then execs the regular non-setuid ELF file.
<p>
It will be nice to have a clean, working implementation in mainstream Linux, but I wonder if anyone will use it, since they haven't cared so far.  I'm the only person I've ever known to use capabilities.

      I suspect yes.  The problem in that scenario is that you still have to go to full priviledges first.  So while the attack vector is very small and unlikely, it's not non-existant.<br>
<p>
If we had fullsystem-based priviledge raises beyond just SUID/SGID, I suspect it would be taken up quite quickly by distros.<br>

Actually, the inheritance behavior in the 2.4 kernel worked fine for me.

The GPL'ed Martus Server software (available near the bottom of the <a href="https://tornado.he.net/cgi-bin/suid/~martus/download.cgi">Martus download page</a>) implements my custom security model based on Linux capabilities.  I wrote a <strong>caps</strong> command that root can execute to change the capabilities of other processes (it sets CAP_SETPCAP in the capability bounding set by poking /dev/mem, then forks and execs to acquire CAP_SETPCAP, then clears CAP_SETPCAP in the bounding set, then applies the user-specified capabilities to the user-specified processes).  I wrote a few paragraphs describing the semantics of the 2.4 kernel's capabilities, based on my experimentation.  My <strong>/etc/rc.d/init.d/martus</strong> startup script sets CAP_SETPCAP (plus a subset of the normal capabilities) in the inheritable set of the <strong>sshd</strong> listener and <strong>init,</strong> and then clears all capabilities in the bounding set (and in other processes running at startup time).  So, a human that logs in gets (a reduced set of) the normal capabilities, but the application-listeners have no capabilities.
<p>
I even use my <strong>caps</strong> command to give CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to a non-root <strong>java</strong>, so it can open a privileged port (after which I remove CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE).
<p>
But, all this was a lot of work.  I'll just use SELinux when I move the software to the 2.6 kernel.

      <blockquote>This patch uses some of those new bits from the outset for a set of "regular 
capabilities" which all processes are normally expected to have. These capabilities include the 
ability to use fork() or exec(), the ability to open files and to write to files, the ability to use ptrace
(), and the ability to increase privilege by running a setuid program.</blockquote>

<p>Woo! I'm glad to see someone do this. I've long thought this was the best 
way to take advantage of capabilities. I even wrote a crappy patch to OpenBSD long ago, which 
fortunately for the world never made it beyond my system.

<p>Many of the regular capabilities can easily be used to gain full root access. (Though I 
thought that about <tt>pcap</tt>, and omnipresent <tt>ssh</tt> 
has proven me wrong.) But locking down <tt>ptrace()</tt> might be a good way to prevent an 
exploited connection from messing with another one in forked servers. I think the only other way 
would be to bind as root, then <tt>setuid()</tt> to one of a pool of uids or something...I hope no 
one's doing 
that.

A pool of UIDs is not required, just doing setuid() after exec() will make the kernel think the process 
is in "setuid state" and won't allow other processes ptrace it.

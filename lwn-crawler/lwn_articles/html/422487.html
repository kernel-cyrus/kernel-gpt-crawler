<p>
Pages
of memory that are 
managed by the 
kernel are governed by access control flags that are somewhat analogous to
the permissions which are applied to files.  Those flags govern whether
the page can be written to and whether its contents can be executed.  Both
attributes are useful to restrict what can happen to those pages in the
presence of 
programming errors or security attacks.  A pair of patches that were
merged in the current merge window will further extend the usage of these
flags for the x86 architecture. 
</p>

<p>
The page access flags, unlike file permissions, are enforced by
the memory management hardware.  The flags of interest for these patches
are "write" and "execute", both of which imply "read" access, so they are
often specified as follows: RO+X (read-only and execute) or RW+NX (read-write
and no-execute).  By restricting the usage of these pages, the scope of
security flaws can be reduced because, for example, a buffer overflow in an
NX page will not be directly useful for code execution.

<p>
The memory that is used by the kernel to hold its read-only data (i.e. the
<tt>.rodata</tt> segment)
has been able to be marked read-only since 2.6.16 in early 2006, depending
on the 
setting of
<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA</tt>.  In 2.6.25, the kernel <tt>.rodata</tt>
segment was additionally marked NX (i.e. no-execute), but only for the
x86_64 architecture.  A <a href="/Articles/342266/">patch</a> that was
originally created for 2.6.30 (for both the 32 and 64-bit x86 architectures)
expanded the use of NX for all kernel data pages, including read-write
sections for initialized
data and BSS. 
</p>

<p>
That patch was created by  Siarhei Liakh and Xuxian Jiang but had fallen by
the wayside after causing some <a
href="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1011.1/00013.html">boot
crashes</a> on one of Ingo Molnar's test systems.  When Kees Cook brought
up the idea of doing better page access protection of the kernel's memory,
Molnar 
<a
href="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1011.1/01290.html">remembered</a>
that Matthieu Castet had "<q>dusted off those patches and submitted two
of them</q>", back in August.  After a few iterations, Molnar pulled
them into the -tip tree, and Linus Torvalds pulled that for the mainline in
the current
2.6.38 merge window.
</p>

<p>
The revised <a href="/Articles/422541/">patch</a> itself is fairly
straightforward. If <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA</tt> is set, various sections
of the kernel (<tt>.text</tt> and <tt>.rodata</tt>) are page aligned for
both their start and end addresses.  
The NX bit is set for all pages from the end of the <tt>.text</tt>
(i.e. code) section to the <tt>_end</tt> address that marks the end of the
kernel's data section. 
</p>

<p>
There were two other pieces of the puzzle addressed in the patch, the first
of which was presumably the cause of the boot crashes that Molnar
had with the earlier patch.  Some older systems that use PCI BIOS require
that some pages in the 640K-1M region be executable.  There are also some
ISA mappings that require read-write access to that region.  Rather than
try to work all of that out, and potentially run afoul of buggy hardware,
the patch just sets pages in that region to be RW+X on systems where PCI
BIOS is used.  The second 
change simply modifies <tt>free_init_pages()</tt> to turn on NX for any
pages that 
are freed that way, so that those pages have to be explicitly allowed to
store executable code when they are reused.
</p>

<p>
A related
<a href="/Articles/422540/">patch</a> adds read-only and no-execute flags to the pages used by
kernel modules.  It came from the same developers, and seems to have been
dropped from -tip along with the NX patch.  And, like the other patch, Castet pushed it the
last bit to finally get it included in the mainline.  
</p>

<p>
The patch splits the module_core and module_init regions into three parts: code,
read-only data, and read-write data.  Each of those parts is page aligned
and the page access permissions are set just before <tt>load_module()</tt>
returns.  For the code pieces, RO+X are set, while the
data parts get NX and either RO or RW depending on
the type of data.
These changes are all governed by the setting of
<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond setting the page access control flags at module load time, the
kernel must also reset those flags to RW+NX when the module is unloaded.
  In addition, the module_init region is freed after
initialization is completed and its pages need to be put back to RW+NX.
There is one further wrinkle: Ftrace needs to be able to modify the code
in modules to enable tracepoints, so the patch provides a means for all
module text pages to be set RW while Ftrace is making those changes, and
then to set them back to RO afterward.

<p>
Marking the kernel module pages as RO and/or NX is important not only because
it is consistent with how the rest of the kernel pages are handled, but
also because it makes other kernel protection efforts actually work for
modules.  For example, there has been an effort to declare structures of function
pointers as <tt>const</tt>, so that exploits cannot change the pointers for
their own nefarious purposes, but that only works if the <tt>.rodata</tt>
pages are actually marked RO. 

<p>
The main cost of these patches is some bits of wasted memory from page aligning
the various sections.  Since that cost is probably not significant for any but
the most resource-constrained embedded systems, it would make sense for
<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA</tt> and <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX</tt> to
be turned on for most distributions&mdash;or to default to "on", though
that is generally frowned upon by Torvalds and others.


<p>
The fact that these patches have been around for a while, but never quite
made the jump into the mainline is unfortunate.  There is no real person or
group that is currently shepherding core kernel security patches along,
though Cook 
and Dan Rosenberg have recently been <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/415603/">making an effort</a> to push these kinds
of changes. Cook's query helped resurrect both of
these patches; they might have languished far longer without that
interest.  

<p>
It is also worth noting that much or all of the protections embodied in
these patches have long been available in the grsecurity/PaX kernels.
While no wholesale import of the features from those kernels is ever going
to happen, piecemeal patches that implement "<q>sane</q>" (<a href="/Articles/313621/">at least in Torvalds's eyes</a>) features can be adopted.
That should lead to better kernel security, which is something that is
certainly worth 
shooting for.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The SMP alternatives are performed during boot up before setting of RO takes effect. As for tracing, there are two ways:<br>
<p>
1) (slower) method is to allocate a new page table entry that points to the same page but with write permission and make the modification via this new page table entrty.<br>
<p>
2) (ftrace function tracer use) just before calling stop machine, all pages are converted back to RW, then stop machine is called and all changes are made, when stop machine finishes, the pages are put back to RO.<br>

they're also performed whenever all but one CPUs are offlined (SMP-&gt;UP) or when the second CPU comes online later (UP-&gt;SMP). this can be achieved by explicit action for a CPU (via /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online) or when suspend/reboot/halt occurs.<br>

Don't their access rights anyway need to be changed whenever they're re-used, depending on what they will be re-used for?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Or is RW+NX use so much more likely that it makes sense to set only RO+X stuff explicitly when pages are taken into that kind of use?</font><br>
Basically yes: the module loader allocates memory through the vmalloc() memory allocator, which is used also in a lots of places in the kernel. (Most) other users of this allocator use it for data, so it has to return RW memory, and it is safe to use +NX for it. The permissions could be set when memory is allocated again, but given that module loading/unloading is also likely to be infrequent you can (and should) make it more expensive, to slowing down all vmalloc() allocations.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I mean, why it isn't RO+NX when not in use?</font><br>
Interesting question, but:<br>
1. Can you exploit more easily a system not doing that? My pretty long answer below is "under extreme circumstances, unlikely to happen in the real world, and (I think) never observed until now". However, maybe some world-class security expert knows of some obscure exception to this.<br>
<p>
If each page is either writable or executable, you can't execute code of your choosing.<br>
If you write to unused memory (which you could do through a buffer overflow overwriting a pointer), that can only affect the system if that memory is not initialized later before being used. That's a further bug needed, quite likely to cause you crashes without need of hostile attacks and therefore less likely to survive in a kernel release, and quite unlikely to allow you to execute arbitrary code (which is what you need). So you need 2 bugs, one of them is of a pretty unlikely kind, and you still can hardly do anything. If you're happy of remotely crashing the system, it's likely that you can do it via a plain buffer overflow.<br>
<p>
2. If you wanted to do this change, either you protect all unused pages, or it isn't worth it, and that has surely a performance cost: you'd need to flush the TLB to apply the permissions change, at each memory allocation. You can't even protect all unused memory ranges, as with any memory allocator you end up with partially unused pages.<br>
Moreover, I bet nobody could ever accept this slowdown for such tiny advantages; if you were ready to pay this price, then why not rather make all these problems impossible by running a kernel written in a memory-safe (i.e. garbage-collected) language, like Singularity? More pragmatically, move more drivers into userspace - there's already effort into this.<br>

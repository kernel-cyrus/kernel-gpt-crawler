<div class="ArticleText">
Your editor remembers a time when "the computer" was a single, large
machine shared among many users.  This large machine was, one might say,
not quite as powerful as the systems we work on - or carry around to play
music on - today, so sharing it between dozens (or more) people was bound
to lead to conflicts.  Accordingly, most timesharing systems in those days
implemented complex resource quota mechanisms to keep users in bounds.  When
these systems worked well, they let people get their work done while
minimizing violence in the hallways.
<p>

It is probably safe to say that almost all deployed Linux systems spend
most of their time serving a single user or task.  There is little need to
keep users from stepping on each others' toes within a single system;
instead, they can fight over the use of external resources like network
bandwidth.  So patches which implement 
such mechanisms (such as the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/145135/">class-based kernel resource
management system</a>) have generally not gotten very far.  The driving
need to fence users within a portion of a system's resources just has not
been there.
<p>

Virtualization and containers may change that situation, however.  The
purpose of these systems is to isolate users from each other.  But if one
container is able to use a disproportionate amount of some vital system
resource, the others will feel its presence.  The illusion of having a
machine to one's self loses some of its credibility if that machine, say, has no
memory available to it.  As these projects gather steam, they are
motivating another look at resource usage management structures.
<p>

CKRM, now known as <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/181857/">resource
groups</a>, may well make a resurgence.  In the mean time, however, another
approach has been proposed in the form of the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/197377/">resource beancounters</a> patch.
The beancounter developers appear to have tried to take a lighter-weight
approach, but this patch still ends up touching a number of places in the
kernel.
<p>

The core object in this mechanism is, yes, the "beancounter."  Each
beancounter in the system tracks the resource usage of a group of processes - presumably
all of the processes running within a specific container.  Beancounters
contain a reference count, a unique ID, and an array of resource values; for
each tracked resource, this array contains a pair of limits, current usage, historical
minimum and maximum use, and a count of how many times an attempt to
increase usage of that resource was denied.  Each process in the system
contains a pointer to its (probably shared) beancounter object.  There is
also a second beancounter, called <tt>fork_bc</tt>, which is used for any
child processes created with <tt>fork()</tt>.
<p>

A new system call, <tt>get_bcid()</tt>, returns the ID number for the
current process's beancounter object.  A suitably privileged user can call:
<p>
<pre>
    int set_bcid(bcid_t id);
</pre>
<p>
to change its current and fork IDs to a new value.  Privileged
processes can also change any process's limits with:
<p>
<pre>
    int set_bclimit(bcid_t id, unsigned long resource, unsigned long *limits);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>resource</tt> identifies which resource limit is being changed,
and <tt>limits</tt> points to an array of two values holding the "barrier"
and "limit" values.  The barrier value is intended to be a sort of soft
limit, where some allocations might fail, but others are allowed to
proceed.
<p>
In the posted patch, only one resource is tracked: kernel memory.  For this
resource, the "barrier" limit applies to most allocations; once the barrier
is hit, allocation attempts will fail.  The allocation of page tables and
related structures, however, can go all the way to the "limit" value.  So,
while a process may start to see operations failing as a result of
excessive kernel memory use, it should still be able to have its page
faults handled normally while it tries to recover.
<p>

The kernel allocates memory in many places, and not all of those should be
charged to the process that happens to be running at the time.  The
beancounter patch adds a couple of new GFP flags to make the difference
explicit.  In the default case, memory allocations are not charged to any
specific beancounter.  Whenever an allocation function is called with the
<tt>__GFP_BC</tt> flag set, however, the current beancounter will be
charged.  An additional flag (<tt>__GFP_BC_LIMIT</tt>) specifies that the
higher limit value is to be used.  There is also a <tt>SLAB_BC</tt> flag
which can cause all allocations from a given slab cache to be charged.
Finally, there is a new <tt>vmalloc_bc()</tt> function which performs the
appropriate accounting.
<p>

Needless to say, finding every allocation which should be tracked and
charged to a beancounter would be a large task.  The current patch does not
even try; instead, it marks enough specific allocations to catch some of
the larger uses of kernel memory and show how the whole system works.  That
may be as far as it gets; getting driver writers, for example, to think
about whether their memory allocations should be charged seems like an
uphill battle.
<p>

Whether this patch set will get any further than CKRM (sorry, "resource
groups") remains to be seen.  There are some concerns about how accounting
for shared resources are handled - does the process group which first
faults in the C library get charged for the whole thing, giving others a
free ride?  Then, many developers will continue to see no real need for this sort
of accounting structure.  The growing use of virtualization techniques may
just be the factor which pushes this kind of patch into the kernel,
however.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Wow.  They've reinvented another flavor of process groups. Kind of like the old AFS PAG, but it tracks resource allocations instead of tracking authentication tokens. And then there's the keyring based implementation of process authentication groups that OpenAFS is moving toward and that NFSv4+ (and any other externally hosted authenticated resource) is going to need. I'm sure there are others. How many different ways of grouping processes do we need, and does some of this code overlap?

      There is a small misunderstanding. Beancounters have nothing to do with tasks directly and don't do task groupping.<br>
Look, there are a lot of resources which can be shared: pages, IPCs, files etc. Task groupping doesn't help anyhow since the same file can belong to 2 different tasks in 2 different resource groups.<br>
So tasks if accounted are just the same kind of abstract objects just like any other are (files, sockets, ...).<br>
<p>
And beancounters do not track and do not have a list of the objects.<br>
Instead, beancounters do:<br>
- accounting<br>
- limiting<br>
- beancounters are referenced to _by_ all the charged objects (not otherwise) to make uncharging correct (objects freeing can be done in arbitrary context).<br>

<p>
The few times I've tried to resolve the kernel memory accounting problem, I've had to quit because <em>most</em> of the resource is shared.

<p>Also, kernel code usually can't tolerate having no memory available to it.  The only reason the kernel works at all today is that things are done to make it unlikely that there isn't a single page of memory available; but with local limits like this, it would happen a lot.

FYI: BC accounting of user memory takes into account _fractions_ of pages. i.e. if 2 users share the same glibc and map the same page into its address space, then both will be charged 1/2 of the page.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The few times I've tried to resolve the kernel memory accounting problem,</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I've had to quit because most of the resource is shared.</font><br>
First, BC accounts only that kernel memory which is user triggerable. i.e. allocated on demand. This is required to prevent DoS. And it is not quite clear how and to whom charge all the other memory allocations, so this looks reasonably enough. e.g. whom should we charge memory allocated by interrupts?<br>
Second, there can be different polices on how to account shared resources. Usually it is handled as "charge to the creator".<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Also, kernel code usually can't tolerate having no memory available to</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; it. The only reason the kernel works at all today is that things are</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; done to make it unlikely that there isn't a single page of memory </font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; available; but with local limits like this, it would happen a lot.</font><br>
This is not 100% true.<br>
Well, at least if we consider the objects which are allocated on user request. One of OpenVZ stress tests is to run 100 VPSs with random BC limits. These triggers different error paths in kernel and we submit patches to mainstream in case of problems. So this works quite stable and tested.<br>

      Hmmm, I've been using this system for many years now in Linux.  The product is Virtuozzo from SW Soft who recently put Open VZ out there for the kernel folks to work with.  By the way, it works exceedingly well.  And for a situation where you can use a common kernel virtualization (para-virtualization) it just beats the pants off VMWare and Xen.<br>

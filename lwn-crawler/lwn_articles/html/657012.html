Companies that run huge data centers have an obvious incentive to get the
most performance possible out of each of their vast number of machines.
Virtualization and live migration help by  allowing tasks to be moved
between machines 
so that each can be run at full utilization, but there is a problem: how do
cooperating jobs find each other as they are moved across the data center?
Numerous solutions to this problem exist; the 4.3 kernel will have another
one, in the form of a technology called identifier locator addressing, or
ILA.
<p>
ILA, which will work only with IPv6, is built on a simple idea:
each task in the data center is assigned a unique identifier that is not
tied to any specific location in the net.  That identifier is built into
that task's IPv6 network address; the networking subsystem then does the
necessary magic to route packets properly between them, changing the routing as
needed as the task moves between machines.
<p>
The details of how ILA works can be found in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-herbert-nvo3-ila-00">this draft
RFC</a>, written by Tom Herbert, who also happens to be the author of the
ILA patches merged into the mainline for 4.3.  In short, ILA splits the
128-bit IPv6 network address space into two 64-bit fields; one contains the
identifier, the other the locator.  The identifier is, as described above,
a unique number identifying the task in the center.  With 64 bits to play
with, ILA can identify enough tasks to work in even the biggest data center
â€” for the foreseeable future, at least.  The identifier is not tied in any
way to any specific physical machine in the data center.  The locator,
instead (stored in the upper 64 bits of the IPv6 address), uniquely
identifies a physical interface on the network; a packet 
with an ILA address can be routed across the network using just the locator
field.
<p>
A task wishing to communicate with another does not know that locator,
though; all it knows is the identifier of the task it needs to talk to.
This task will put a special "standard identifier representation" (SIR)
prefix into the locator field, while the destination task's identifier goes
into the lower 64 bits.  The resulting "SIR address," which does not
correspond to any actual system on the net, indicates to the networking
subsystem that the address uses ILA and that the true locator must be
filled in at transmission time.  In practice, this SIR address will
likely be obtained via a DNS lookup and need not be constructed by the task
at all, of course.

<p>

The task will then open a network connection to the SIR address for the
service it needs to contact.  The networking stack cannot route the SIR
address as-is, though, since that address doesn't correspond to any
specific target on the net.  Instead, it must find the real machine hosting
the task with the given identifier and replace the SIR prefix  with a
proper locator corresponding to that system.  It is thus almost like
performing an ARP lookup on 
the identifier portion of the address.  Once the real destination has been
placed into the locator field, the packet can be sent on its way.  The
receiving system will, prior to handing the packet to the application,
convert the ILA address back to a SIR address by putting
the SIR prefix back into the locator field.
<p>
The SIR address will be used for the duration of the connection; it will
continue to work even if the addressed task is migrated in the middle.
That naturally means that the identifier lookup and SIR-prefix replacement
must be done on each outgoing packet.
It's worth noting that SIR addresses can be used for both endpoints of a
connection, but it's not mandatory.
The end result of all this should be a low-overhead mechanism for
virtualization of 
network addresses within a data center.  There is no encapsulation or other
trickery required; it essentially comes down to a single
address-translation step.
<p>
There is one little catch, of course: the kernel must somehow keep up with
the proper locator value for each identifier of interest.  As documented in
<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/0b233dc7167884f95f08e796ac6a6767ae7d0d70">the
networking merge commit</a>, the table of translations can be maintained by
way of some extensions to the <tt>ip</tt> command.  In practice, of course,
nobody who needs a technology like ILA is going to mess around with
<tt>ip</tt> commands; there will, instead, be some sort of central
job-management system that maintains that mapping.  How mappings (and
changes) will be propagated through a data center is not addressed by the
code in the kernel; that's a task for higher-level software.  The good news
is that mappings are not expected to change all that often (task migration
is expensive, so it shouldn't be done more often than is strictly
necessary), so the identifier-to-locator mapping can be effectively cached
most of the time.
<p>
The ILA implementation in 4.3 appears to be a bit of a work in progress.
It works, but it suffers a 10% performance penalty with respect to routing
without ILA.  The source of the slowdown seems to be known, and Tom has
promised that it will be dealt with in a forthcoming patch set.  There are
also difficulties in the interaction with <a
href="http://people.netfilter.org/pablo/netdev0.1/papers/IPVLAN-The-beginning.pdf">IPvlan
[PDF]</a> that should also be fixed in the future.
Meanwhile, the core of the new feature is in the mainline and available for
those who would like to play with it.
<p>
Among other things, ILA is a sign
that IPv6 is finally coming into its own.  It was not that long ago that
IPv6 would not have been considered for performance-sensitive settings like
data centers; it is easy enough to use an isolated IPv4 network and avoid
the performance issues and application compatibility issues that came with
IPv6.  But most of those issues have been resolved, and the pressure to
move toward IPv6 continues to increase.  As technologies like ILA come
along and make use of the greatly expanded IPv6 address space, IPv6 may
increasingly come to look like the more fully featured alternative.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is a really awesome idea. Next step would be to give each (Docker) container a 64-bit identifier and you can use this to provide all the virtual networking you need to be able to migrate containers between hosts.<br>
<p>
Though it will take a little while to get this version of the kernel deployed wide enough to be able to rely on it...<br>

It's such an obvious use case the draft mentions containers only 5 times. ;-)<br>
<p>
Also mentions: virtual machines aren't the obvious use case.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I need to find some time and read all of it.<br>
<p>
It seems to me:<br>
- it's similar to DNS name which points to an IP-address. I wonder if it can point to multiple IP-addresses.<br>
<p>
- it's also similar to DNS because it looks like a central service can be used to answers queries about it.<br>
<p>
- it's not similar to using routing on every host.<br>
<p>
- it's more useful than DNS because you can keep connections open when migrating processes from one machine to an other.<br>
<p>
- assume it's not tied to layer 2 and works across layer 2 domains.<br>
<p>
But hey, I still need to read it properly. So maybe I'm wrong.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 8, 2007</br>
           </div>
Among the metadata maintained by most filesystems is the last file access
time, or "atime."  This time can be a useful value to have - it lets an
administrator (or a program) know when a file was last used.  There is a
strong downside to this feature, though: it forces a write to the disk
every time a file is accessed.  So read-only operations, which might have
been satisfied entirely from cache, turn into filesystem writes to keep the
atime value up to date.  
<p>
A recent discussion on write throttling turned to atime after Ingo Molnar
pointed out that atime was probably a bigger performance problem than just
about everything else.  He <a href="/Articles/244830/">went on to say</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Atime updates are by far the biggest IO performance deficiency that
	Linux has today. Getting rid of atime updates would give us more
	everyday Linux performance than all the pagecache speedups of the
	past 10 years, _combined_.
</div>
<p>
He also claimed that it was "<q>perhaps the most stupid Unix design idea
of all times</q>".
<p>

Such discussion leads quickly to the question of what should be done about
this old situation.  One step that any Linux user can take now is to mount
filesystems with the <tt>noatime</tt> option, which turns off the tracking
of access times.  For filesystem-intensive tasks, the performance reward
can be immediately apparent.  Unfortunately, turning off atime
unconditionally will occasionally break software.  Some mail tools will
compare modification and access times to determine whether there is unread
mail or not.  The <tt>tmpwatch</tt> utility and some backup tools also use
atime and can misbehave if atime is not correct.  For this reason,
distributors tend not to make <tt>noatime</tt> the default on installed
systems. 
<p>

Another approach was added in 2.6.20: the <tt>relatime</tt> mount option.  If
this flag is set, access times are only updated if they are (before the
update) earlier than the modification time.  This change allows utilities
to see if the current version of a file has been read, but still cuts down
significantly on atime updates.  This option is not heavily used, perhaps
because few people have heard of it and many distributions lack a version of
<tt>mount</tt> which is new enough to know about it.  Using
<tt>relatime</tt> can still confuse tools which want to ask questions like
"has this file been accessed in the last week?"  
<p>

To fix that problem, Linus <a href="/Articles/244831/">suggested</a> a
tweak to how <tt>relatime</tt> works: update it if the current value is
more than a certain time in the past - one day, for example.  Ingo
responded with <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/244384/">a patch</a>
implementing that behavior and adding a couple of new boot options:
<tt>relatime_interval</tt>, which specifies the update interval in seconds,
and <tt>default_relatime</tt>, which turns on the <tt>relatime</tt> option
in all filesystems by default.
<p>

Something resembling this version of the patch might go into 2.6.24.  It
was suggested that, whenever a file's inode is to be written to disk
anyway, the kernel might as well update atime as well.  Alan Cox objected
that this change might make the overall behavior less predictable, which
might not be desirable.  No new version of the patch with this feature has
been posted, so chances are it will not be in the version which gets merged
- if and when that happens.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Part of the reason that atime causes disk traffic is that if a file is read many times (each read satisfied from cache) an atime update will be generated for each time the file is read. So you get multiple disk writes to same the inodes over and over.<br>
<p>
Why not defer the inode updates, then you might get one set of disk writes either when the file system is unmounted or when it becomes idle or at scheduled intervals (eg every 1/2 hour). In practice many systems do not open large numbers of files, but repeatedly access a subset time and again. The usual exception to this is the backup program.<br>
<p>
From my point of view: if the system dies before it writes the atime out then not a lot is lost; maybe a spurious ''you have mail'' when I login again.<br>
<p>
Memory usage is the primary cost as the in-memory inode needs to be kept longer than it normally would be. This could be ameliorated by having a new strucut (device, inode#, atime) to store this info if we trash the in-memory inode.<br>

      I'm pretty sure the noatime incompatibility with mail programs shows up 
only when using a single-file mailbox format (usually <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox</a>).  Yet another reason to 
use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">maildir</a> instead.

Experimenting a bit, the unread flag is marked by files being in the new/ directory in maildir. So maildir seems that the common implementation wouldn't care about atime at all.<br>

<P>Solaris has a "defer atime" mount option that does the atime update
only when other disk I/O is scheduled, which gives a fairly fine-grained
update, and makes the behavior less prefictable, but <I>closer
to what happens when atime is turned on</I>.  This approach has
been in place for a number of years (five or six, at least) and
doesn't confuse programs or unsuspecting users.

      Everyone knows about noatime, but it seems almost nobody uses nodiratime.<br>
<p>
The thread this discussion was in notes that the kernel devs like Linus explicitly not only noatime, but also nodiratime.  I ASSume that noatime only affects files and that directories need nodiratime.<br>

      noatime implies nodiratime - it's a superset.  You can use nodiratime by itself to turn off the updates on directories only.  As you note, it does not seem to be widely used.

      <p>Are you sure about noatime implying nodiratime?</p>

<p>mount(8) states:<br /><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;noatime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not update inode access times on this file system[...]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nodiratime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.
</code></p>

<p>while mount(2) puts it this way:<br />
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MS_NOATIME<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this file system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;MS_NODIRATIME<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not update access times for directories on this file system.
</code></p>

<p>I wonder how to interpret mount(2)'s <em>(all types of) files</em> for noatime: Is a directory considered a file in this context?</p>

      Yep, I'm sure.  When in doubt, use the source.  From <tt>touch_atime()</tt> in <tt>fs/inode.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
void touch_atime(struct vfsmount *mnt, struct dentry *dentry)
{
        /* ... */
        if (inode-&gt;i_flags &amp; S_NOATIME)
                return;
        if (IS_NOATIME(inode))
                return;
        if ((inode-&gt;i_sb-&gt;s_flags &amp; MS_NODIRATIME) &amp;&amp; S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
                return;
</pre>
<p>
So if NOATIME is set, the NODIRATIME flag is never even checked.

      OK. I've been using noatime systematically for years. And then I read about a prominent kernel developer like Molnar using both noatime and nodiratime, making me worried: Have I been missing out on I/O-performance for years?<br>
<p>
- But your definite statement is comforting, thanks. I'll keep using just "noatime".<br>

      Actually, Andrew Morton actually corrected Ingo on this point:

noatime is a superset of nodiratime, btw.

I trust Andrew on this point.  :-)

      One other possibility is to keep atime updates in memory and only write them out to disk if the page was to be flushed to disk anyway. That would mean storing atimes in memory in a separate structure outside of the regular page.<br>
<p>
The additional memory requirements should be relatively small, but the extra time needed to perform atime lookup might not be.<br>
<p>
It would also mean that after a crash atimes will be wrong.<br>

      Interestingly, Microsoft seems to have looked at this issue in the past.  From MSDN:  <br>
<p>
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724290.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724290.aspx</a><br>
Not all file systems can record creation and last access time and not<br>
all file systems record them in the same manner. For example, on NT<br>
FAT, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write time has a<br>
resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day<br>
(really, the access date). On NTFS, access time has a resolution of 1<br>
hour.<br>

      The only program that I run that benefits from atime is Debian's "popcon", which records which packages are installed and which of those has been used recently.  This would work well with the "update atime when &gt; 1 day" approach suggested by Linus.<br>

On the surface, the kernel's internal timer mechanism would not appear to
have changed much in a long time; the core API looks quite similar to the
one present in the 1.0 release.  Underneath the API, naturally, quite a bit
of complexity has been added over the years.  The implementation of this
API looks to become even more complex — but faster — if and when <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221104145737.71236-1-anna-maria@linutronix.de/">this 
patch set</a> from Anna-Maria Behnsen finds its way into the mainline.
<p>
<h4>Premature optimization</h4>
<p>
For context, it is worth remembering that the kernel actually has two core APIs for the
management of internal timers.  <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/timers/hrtimers.html">High-resolution
timers</a> (hrtimers) are, as their name would suggest, used for
near-future events where precision is important; they are relatively
expensive and only used when necessary.  For everything else, there is the
subsystem just known as "kernel timers" (or, sometimes, "timer-wheel
timers"), centered around functions like <a 
href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/driver-api/basics.html?#c.add_timer"><tt>add_timer()</tt></a>.
Behnsen's patch set changes how these ordinary kernel timers work.
<p>
Arguably, most uses of kernel timers are the kernel ensuring that it will
respond properly if an expected event doesn't happen.  A driver may start
an I/O operation on a device confident in the knowledge that the device
will raise an interrupt when the operation completes, but it will still set
a timer so that, if the device goes out to lunch, the operation doesn't
just hang indefinitely.  Other parts of the kernel, such as networking, use
timers in similar ways.
<p>
There are a couple of interesting implications that arise from this usage
pattern.  One is that such timers need not expire at exactly their nominal
expiration time; if the kernel takes a little while to get around to
handling an expired timer, nothing bad happens.  That allows the kernel to
batch timer expirations and to defer them to avoid waking an otherwise idle
CPU.  The implication that is relevant here, though, is that kernel timers
rarely expire.  When things are operating normally, the expected events
will occur and the timer will either be canceled or reset to a new time
further in the future.  As a result, the timer subsystem should be
optimized for the creation and cancellation of timer events.  And, indeed,
much effort has gone into that sort of optimization, as can be seen in LWN
coverage from as far back as <a href="/Articles/84836/">2004</a> up to <a
href="/Articles/646950/">a significant reimplementation</a> of timers in
2015.
<p>
Behnsen has identified a place where further optimization can be performed,
though.  When a timer is set in current kernels, the timer subsystem spends
some CPU time trying to decide which CPU should handle the expiration of that timer.
The intent is to push that work to a CPU that is
already busy rather than waking an idle CPU just to expire a timer.  So the
timer subsystem scans through the system looking for a suitable CPU and
adds the timer to the appropriate queue.
<p>
There are a couple of problems with this algorithm, though.  One is that a
CPU that is busy now may no longer be busy when the timer expires.  So the
choice of a CPU to handle expiration, if made when the timer is set, is
really just a guess.  Perhaps worse, though, is that this work is being
done at the wrong time; since most timers never expire, any effort that is
put into picking the expiration CPU ahead of time is likely to be wasted,
even if the guess turns out to be a good one.  It would be far better to
not do any extra work when a timer is set, and have a CPU that is actually
busy at expiration time take care of it then — on the relatively rare
occasion when a timer actually expires.
<p>
The first part — not picking an expiration CPU at setting time — is easy to
implement; a timer is just put into the queue of the CPU that is setting it.
Having a suitable CPU actually handle expiration is harder, 
though.  A naive implementation might just create a simple queue of timers
that a CPU would check occasionally if it's running and able to handle
expirations.  That would create a great deal of locking contention and
cache-line bouncing, though, slowing things down even when there were no
timers to handle.  So something more complex is called for.
<p>
<h4>Choosing the expiration CPU</h4>
<p>
The scheme chosen is to organize the system's CPUs into a hierarchy that
resembles the hardware topology, but which is independent from it.  At the
lowest level, CPUs are assembled into groups of up to eight, with the constraint
that all eight must be contained within the same NUMA node.  The groups
are, themselves, organized into groups; this process continues until all
CPUs in the system have been arranged into a single tree.
<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/timer-exp.svg" alt="[CPU-group organization]"
width=300 class="photo" align="right" hspace=5>

Consider, for
example, a simple, four-CPU system organized into two NUMA nodes as shown
to the right.  The first two CPUs are organized into Group&nbsp;1; the
other two, since they are in a different NUMA node, go into a separate
group.  Those two groups, in turn, are placed together in Group&nbsp;3.  A
larger and more complex system might require more levels of group
hierarchy, but that gets awkward to show in a simple diagram.

<p>
The timer API allows timers to be pinned to specific CPUs; that does not
change in the reimplementation.  Each CPU will have to handle expiration
for its pinned timers, even if that means waking from an idle state.  Most
timers, though, can be executed anywhere in the system and are not pinned;
the handling of these "global" timers will be different from before.  A CPU
that is busy will continue to handle global timers that are in its specific
queue but, if that CPU goes idle, it will instead add its soonest-expiring
global timer to the queue associated with its group.
<p>
Normally, each CPU group will designate one of its members as the
"migrator".  That CPU, which cannot be idle, will occasionally check the
queue associated with its group for expiring global timers; if the CPU that
queued a timer there is still idle, then the migrator will pull it over and
handle the expiration instead, and the CPU that initially queued the timer can
remain idle.  So, for example, if CPU&nbsp;1 in the diagram above is idle,
it will have enqueued its earliest-expiring global timer in Group&nbsp;1;
if CPU&nbsp;2 is running (and is thus the migrator), it will handle that
timer when it expires.
<p>
If the migrator goes idle, then another CPU in the group has to be handed
the baton and become the new migrator; that is just a matter of finding the
next busy CPU in that group.  If all of the other CPUs are also idle,
instead, then the group ends up without a migrator.  In this case, the
group is marked as idle in the <i>next</i> higher group in the hierarchy,
and its first-expiring timer is queued at that next level.  So, if
CPU&nbsp;2 also goes idle, it will take the earliest-expiring event in
Group&nbsp;1 and put it into the queue at Group&nbsp;3.
<p>

The assignment of the migrator role happens in the higher-level groups as
well.  If a group contains other groups, one of those groups will be the
migrator for that level.  In the scenario described here, Group&nbsp;2 will
be the migrator for Group&nbsp;3.  The CPU running as the migrator within
Group&nbsp;2 (either CPU&nbsp;3 or CPU&nbsp;4) will thus have to handle
timer events for Group&nbsp;3 as well.  In a system with a lot of idle
CPUs, this migrator role can propagate all the way to the top of the
hierarchy, at which point one CPU may be responsible for handling all
expiring timers in the system.

<p>
If <i>that</i> CPU also goes idle, the system will be left without any
migrator CPU at all.  At that point, the last CPU standing will set a
hardware timer to wake it at the expiration time for the earliest expiring
timer.  That ensures that timer events don't get dropped even in the
absence of busy CPUs to handle them.
<p>
Implementing this machinery in the timer subsystem results in a patch set
adding nearly 2,000 lines of code to a core kernel subsystem.  The benefit
that comes from this work is said to be an approximately 25% reduction in the time
required to add and remove a timer.  Since timers can be set (and changed)
within performance-sensitive code, this improvement likely justifies
the added complexity.
<p>
A side benefit of this work is that it should enable the removal of the <a
href="/Articles/228143/">deferrable timers</a> mechanism.  Deferrable
timers are those for which expiration can be deferred without any ill
effect; a CPU that is going idle will not wake up solely to handle a
deferrable timer.  Turning deferrable timers into global timers will have
the same effect — they will no longer cause a sleeping CPU to wake — so
there is no longer a need to handle them separately.  The removal of
deferrable timers, which is, according to Behnsen, coming soon, will
counterbalance some of the complexity added by this work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Is there a big-little aspect in selecting the migrator? I imagine it's best left to one of the little processors most of the time, in part because those are (or should be) cheaper to put to sleep and wake up.<br>

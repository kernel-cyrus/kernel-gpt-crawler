           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 13, 2024</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd</a> abstraction is a Linux-specific
way of referring to processes that avoids the race conditions inherent in
Unix process ID numbers.  Since a pidfd is a file descriptor, it needs a
filesystem to implement the usual operations performed on files.  As the
use of pidfds has grown, they have stressed the limits of the simple
filesystem that was created for them.  Christian Brauner has <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240213-vfs-pidfd_fs-v1-0-f863f58cfce1@kernel.org/">created
a new filesystem for pidfds</a> that seems likely to debut in the 6.9
kernel, but it ran into a little bump along the way, demonstrating that
things you cannot see can still hurt you.
<p>
In this case, the pidfd filesystem is indeed invisible; it cannot be
mounted and accessed like most other filesystems.  A pidfd is created
with a system call like <a
href="/Articles/789023/"><tt>pidfd_open()</tt></a> or <a
href="/Articles/792628/"><tt>clone3()</tt></a>, so there is no need for a
visible filesystem.  (One <i>could</i> imagine such a filesystem as a way
of showing all of the existing processes in the system, but <tt>/proc</tt>
already exists for that purpose).  Since there was no need to implement
many of the usual filesystem operations, pidfds were implemented using <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/anon_inodes.c#L127"><tt>anon_inode_getfile()</tt></a>,
a helper that creates file descriptors for simple, virtual filesystems.
Over time, though, this filesystem has proved to be a bit too simple,
leading to Brauner's pidfdfs proposal as a replacement.
<p>
So what was the problem with the anonymous-inode approach?  Brauner
provides a list of capabilities added by pidfdfs in the changelog to <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240213-vfs-pidfd_fs-v1-2-f863f58cfce1@kernel.org/">this
patch</a>.  It allows system calls like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
to be used on a pidfd, for example, and that, in turn, allows for direct
comparison of two pidfds to see whether they refer to the same process.
While not implemented yet, pidfdfs will enable functionality like
automatically killing a process when the last pidfd referring to it is
closed.  The initial version of the series also used <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/open.c#L1074"><tt>dentry_open()</tt></a>
to set up the "file" behind the pidfd; that brought the opening of the
pidfd under the control of Linux security modules and made the user-space
file-notification system calls work with them as well.
<p>
The patch series subsequently had to evolve considerably, though.  Linus
Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wjr+K+x8bu2=gSK8SehNWnY3MGxdfO9L25tKJHTUK0x0w@mail.gmail.com/">was
not entirely happy</a> with how it had been implemented, even though much
of that implementation was borrowed from the existing namespace filesystem
in the kernel.  Some significant reworking followed, resulting in a cleaner
implementation that Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wgSjKuYHXd56nJNmcW3ECQR4=a5_14jQiUswuZje+XF_Q@mail.gmail.com/">described</a>
as "<q>quite nice</q>".
<p>
That was not the end of the story, though.  Nathan Chancellor <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240222190334.GA412503@dev-arch.thelio-3990X/">reported</a>
that, with pidfdfs in the kernel, many services on his system failed 
at boot time; Heiko Carstens <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240223101833.16153-A-hca@linux.ibm.com/">ran into
similar problems</a>.  It turns out that, while users may or may not
appreciate the robustness of race-free process management, they are,
without exception, unimpressed by a system that lacks functional
networking.  So Brauner had to go looking for an explanation.
<p>
It seems, though, that he <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240223-delfin-achtlos-e03fd4276a34@brauner/">already
knew where to look</a> when "<q>something fails for completely inexplicable
reasons</q>": the SELinux security module.  As noted above, one of the
advantages of the new filesystem is that it exposed pidfd operations to
security modules, which is something that the policy maintainers had
requested.  The downside is that it exposed those operations to security
modules, one of which promptly set about denying them.
<p>
There was, as Brauner later <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240223-schusselig-windschatten-a108c9034c5b@brauner/">described</a>,
a bit of a cascade of failures here.  SELinux started seeing events on a
new type of file descriptor that it had no policy for; following fairly
normal security practice, it responded by denying everything, causing
attempts to work with pidfds to fail.  The <tt>dbus-broker</tt> process, on
seeing these failures, decided to just throw up its virtual hands and let
the system collapse into a smoldering heap.  This is somewhat ironic given
that, as Brauner pointed out, that process has a PID-using fallback path
that it uses on kernels that do not support pidfds at all, but it didn't
use that path here.  So, to truly fix this problem, there needs to be both
an SELinux policy update and a D-Bus fix; patches for both  have already
been prepared and submitted.
<p>
Even then, though, there was the little problem that some systems may get a
new kernel before the above fixes arrive.  The same users who have proved
so strangely intolerant of broken networking are likely to also be slow to
accept the idea that networking will only come back once their user-space
code has been fixed and updated.  Beyond that, Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wg0D8g_97_pakX-tC2DnANE-=6ZNY5bz=-hP+uHYyh4=g@mail.gmail.com/">didn't
like the idea</a> that the internal filesystem change somehow caused the
resulting descriptors to behave differently in user space, and requested
that something better be done.
<p>
After a bit of discussion, Brauner <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240224-altgedienten-meerwasser-1fb9de8f4050@brauner/">found
a solution</a>.  Rather than call <tt>dentry_open()</tt>, the new
filesystem sets up the new file descriptor directly, using lower-level
operations, and without invoking the problematic security hook.  The people
in charge of security modules still want to be able to intervene in pidfd
creation, of course; that will be accommodated by adding a new security
hook for that case.  Once SELinux (or any other security module) is ready
to make decisions about pidfds, it can use the new hook; until then, things
will work as they did before.  Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=whvWr5j6DZqepuNx1-ChgNxM++h1OfOPfKaJrC-TeSaDg@mail.gmail.com/">liked
this approach</a>: "<q>This is how new features go in: they act like the
old ones, but have expanded capabilities that you can expose for people who
want to use them</q>".
<p>
With those changes, it would appear that the roadblocks to the addition of
pidfdfs have been overcome.  The code is in linux-next now, and will
probably find its way to the mainline for the 6.9 release.  Most users
will, if all goes according to plan, never notice that anything has
changed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

According to pidfd_open(2), opening /proc/pid *does* give you a pidfd, but it has a few minor restrictions compared to a properly-obtained pidfd (from pidfd_open(2) or clone(2)). I am uncertain of the reason for those restrictions, but it does look like there was a conscious decision to create two different kinds of pidfd. Maybe someone who actually knows what they're talking about can shed further light on this issue.<br>

IIRC the main difference is that you can only get the pidfd from /proc after the process has been created. This leaves (at least a little) time for the desired process to exit and the pid to recycled for another process.<br>
<p>
This race condition is one of the main things pidfds exist to fix, so it's better to get the fd immediately at process creation.<br>

A pid can only be recycled after the parent process called waitpid or related methods. Thus in a properly written application there should be no race when using the pid. <br>
<p>
However that does complicate the code especially when one writes a library that wants to start external process as arranging for waitpid call becomes problematic.<br>

It's extra-annoying because waitpid() only has a limited set of options for what you can wait for. You can't choose an arbitrary set of processes to wait on.<br>
<p>
It's also a problem that only the parent can do the wait. You can't pass ownership of the subprocess to another process this way.<br>

<p>
Technically, you can sorta kinda hand the ownership to another process by passing PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER to prctl(2), but there are so many caveats with this method that it's not even funny:<br>
<p>
* The destination process must be an ancestor of you.<br>
* You have to orphan the child process, which means you have to do a double-fork.<br>
* It is a global (process-wide) flag on the destination process, which makes it assume ownership of all orphaned processes under it, not just your particular process. If the destination does not periodically call wait, it will leak zombies until it dies.<br>
* It is really meant to be used by things like systemd. If you are not implementing something that resembles systemd, there are probably other pitfalls I'm unaware of.<br>
<p>
In short: This may be reasonable if you are trying to make an entirely self-contained self-managing all-singing all-dancing daemon that does all of its own bookkeeping, sessions, etc., but in practice you're probably better off configuring systemd to do those things for you instead, unless you're one of those sysvinit-or-death people.<br>

That only helps if it's the parent process that needs to reliably identify another process. That is not the case, and hasn't been for years.<br>

It's frustrating that all of these decisions around LSM hooks and the SELinux implementation were done without CC'ing the LSM or SELinux mailing lists.  We need to improve collaboration across Linux kernel subsystems, and adding the appropriate CCs to a discussion - even part way through the discussion - should be standard practice.<br>

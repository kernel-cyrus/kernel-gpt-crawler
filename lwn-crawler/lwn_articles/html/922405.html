           </div>
It was only a matter of time before somebody tried to bring BPF to the
kernel's CPU scheduler.  At the end of January, Tejun Heo posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-1-tj@kernel.org/">the second
revision of a 30-part patch series</a>, co-written with David Vernet, Josh
Don, and Barret Rhoden, that does just that.  There are clearly interesting
things that could be done by deferring scheduling decisions to a BPF
program, but it may take some work to sell this idea to the development
community as a whole.
<p>
The core idea behind BPF is that it allows programs to be loaded into the
kernel from user space at run time; using BPF for scheduling has the
potential to enable significantly different scheduling behavior than is
seen in Linux systems now.  The idea of "pluggable" schedulers is not new;
it came up in <a href="/Articles/109458/">this 2004 discussion</a> of yet
another doomed patch series from Con Kolivas, for example.  At that time,
the idea of pluggable schedulers was strongly rejected; only by focusing
energy on a single scheduler, it was argued, could the development
community find a way to satisfy all workloads without filling the kernel
with a confusion of special-purpose schedulers.
<p>
Of course, the idea that the kernel only has one CPU scheduler is not quite
accurate; there are actually several of them, including the realtime and
deadline schedulers, that applications can choose between.  But almost all
work on Linux systems runs under the default "completely fair scheduler",
which indeed does a credible job of managing a wide variety of workloads on
everything from embedded systems to supercomputers.  There is always a
desire for better performance, but there have been almost no requests for a
pluggable scheduler mechanism for years.
<p>
Why, then, is the BPF mechanism being proposed now?  In clear anticipation
of a long discussion, the cover letter for the patch series describes the
motivation behind this work at great length.  In short, the argument goes,
the ability to write scheduling policies in BPF greatly lowers the
difficulty of experimenting with new approaches to scheduling.  Both our
workloads and the systems they run on have become much more complex since
the completely fair scheduler was introduced; experimentation is needed to
develop scheduling algorithms that are suited to current systems.  The BPF
scheduling class allows that experimentation in a safe manner without even
needing to reboot the test machine.  BPF-written schedulers can also
improve performance for niche workloads that may not be worth supporting in
the mainline kernel and are much easier to deploy to a large fleet of
systems.

<p>
<h4>Scheduling with BPF</h4>
<p>
The patch set adds a new scheduling class, called <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>, that
can be selected with a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html"><tt>sched_setscheduler()</tt></a>
call like most others (selecting <tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt> is a bit more
complicated).  It is an unprivileged class, meaning that any process can
place itself into <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>.  <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> is placed between
the idle class (<tt>SCHED_IDLE</tt>) and the completely fair scheduler
(<tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt>) in the priority stack.  As a result, no
<tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> scheduler can take over the system in a way that would
prevent, for example, an ordinary shell session running as
<tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt> from running.  It also suggests that, on systems
where <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> is in use, the expectation is that the bulk of the
workload will be running in that class.
<p>
The BPF-written scheduler is global to the system as a whole; there is no
provision for different groups of processes to load their own schedulers.
If there is no BPF scheduler loaded, then any processes that have been put
into the <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> class will be run as if they were in
<tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt> instead.  Once a BPF scheduler is loaded, though, it
will take over the responsibility for all <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> tasks.  There
is also a magic function that a BPF scheduler can call
(<tt>scx_bpf_switch_all()</tt>) that will move <i>all</i> processes running
below realtime priority into <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>.
<p>
A BPF program implementing a scheduler will normally manage a set of
dispatch queues, each of which may contain runnable tasks that are waiting
for a CPU to execute on.  By default, there is one dispatch queue for every
CPU in the system, and one global queue.  When a CPU is ready to run a
new task, the scheduler will pull a task off of the relevant dispatch queue
and give it the CPU.  The BPF side of the scheduler is mostly implemented
as a set of callbacks to be invoked via <a href="/Articles/811631/">an
operations structure</a>, each of which informs the BPF code of an event or
a decision that needs to be made.  The list is long; the full set can be
found in <a
href="https://github.com/htejun/sched_ext/blob/sched_ext-v2/include/linux/sched/ext.h#L165"><tt>include/sched/ext.h</tt></a>
in the <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt> repository branch.
This list includes:
<P>
<blockquote>
<dl class="spacylist">
<dt><tt>prep_enable()</tt></dt>
<dt><tt>enable()</tt></dt>
<dd> The first callback informs the scheduler of a new task that is
     entering <tt>SCHED_EXT</tt>; the scheduler can use it to set up any
     associated data for that task.  <tt>prep_enable()</tt> is allowed to
     block and can be used for memory allocations.  <tt>enable()</tt>,
     which cannot block, actually enables scheduling for the new task.
</dd>
<dt><tt>select_cpu()</tt></dt>
<dd> Select a CPU for a task that is just waking up; it should return the
     number of the CPU to place the task on.  This decision can be
     revisited before the task actually runs, but it may be used by the
     scheduler to wake the selected CPU if it is currently idle.
</dd>
<dt><tt>enqueue()</tt></dt>
<dd> Enqueue a task into the scheduler for running.  Normally this callback
     will call <tt>scx_bpf_dispatch()</tt> to place the task into the
     chosen dispatch queue, from which it will eventually be run.  Among
     other things, that call provides the length of the time slice that
     should be given to the task once it runs.  If the slice is specified
     as <tt>SCX_SLICE_INF</tt>, the CPU will go into the <a
     href="/Articles/549580/">tickless mode</a> when this task runs.
<p>
     It's worth noting that <tt>enqueue()</tt> is not <i>required</i> to
     put the task into any dispatch queue; it could squirrel that task away
     somewhere for the time being if the task should not run immediately.
     The kernel keeps track, though, to ensure that no task gets forgotten;
     if a task languishes for too long (30&nbsp;seconds by default, though
     the timeout can be shortened), the BPF scheduler will eventually
     be unloaded.
</dd>
<dt><tt>dispatch()</tt></dt>
<dd> Called when a CPU's dispatch queue is empty; it should dispatch
     tasks into that queue to keep the CPU busy.  If the dispatch queue
     remains empty, the scheduler will try to grab tasks from the global
     queue instead.
</dd>
<dt><tt>update_idle()</tt></dt>
<dd> This callback informs the scheduler when a CPU is entering or leaving
     the idle state.
</dd>
<dt><tt>runnable()</tt></dt>
<dt><tt>running()</tt></dt>
<dt><tt>stopping()</tt></dt>
<dt><tt>quiescent()</tt></dt>
<dd> These all inform the scheduler about status changes for a task; they
     are called when, respectively, a task becomes runnable, starts running
     on a CPU, is taken off a CPU, or becomes no longer runnable.
</dd>
<dt><tt>cpu_acquire()</tt></dt>
<dt><tt>cpu_release()</tt></dt>
<dd> Inform the scheduler about the status of the CPUs in the system.  When
     a CPU becomes available for the BPF scheduler to manage, a callback to
     <tt>cpu_acquire()</tt> informs it of the fact.  The loss of a CPU
     (because, perhaps, a realtime scheduling class has claimed it) is
     notified with a call to <tt>cpu_release()</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are numerous other callbacks for the management of control groups,
CPU affinity,
core scheduling, and more.  There is also a set of functions that the
scheduler can call to affect scheduling decisions; for example,
<tt>scx_bpf_kick_cpu()</tt> can be used to preempt a task running on a
given CPU and call back into the scheduler to pick a new task to run there.
<p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>
The end result is a framework that allows the implementation of a wide
range of scheduling policies in BPF code.  To prove the point, the patch
series includes a number of sample schedulers.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-15-tj@kernel.org/">This
patch</a> contains a minimal "dummy" scheduler that uses the default for
all of the callbacks; it also has a basic scheduler that implements five
priority levels and shows how to stash tasks into BPF maps.  "<q>While not
very practical, this is useful as a simple example and will be used to
demonstrate different features</q>".
<p>
Beyond that, there is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-20-tj@kernel.org/">a
"central" scheduler</a> that dedicates one CPU to scheduling decisions,
leaving all others free to run the workload.  A <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-23-tj@kernel.org/">later
patch</a> adds tickless support to that scheduler and concludes:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	While scx_example_central itself is too barebone to be useful as a
	production scheduler, a more featureful central scheduler can be
	built using the same approach. Google's experience shows that such
	an approach can have significant benefits for certain applications
	such as VM hosting.
</blockquote>
<p>
As if that weren't enough, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-24-tj@kernel.org/"><tt>scx_example_pair</tt></a>
implements a form of <a href="/Articles/861251/">core scheduling</a> using
control groups.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-30-tj@kernel.org/"><tt>scx_example_userland</tt></a>
scheduler "<q>implements a fairly unsophisticated sorted-list vruntime
scheduler in userland to demonstrate how most scheduling decisions can be
delegated to userland</q>".  The series concludes with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230128001639.3510083-31-tj@kernel.org/">Atropos
scheduler</a>, which features a significant user-space component written in
Rust.  The cover letter describes one more, <a
href="https://github.com/htejun/sched_ext/commit/f2fcd3147fb6286e0a35fcbed33c3bac69546a96"><tt>scx_example_cgfifo</tt></a>,
which wasn't included because it depends on the still out-of-tree <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230131180016.3368305-1-davemarchevsky@fb.com/">BPF rbtree
patches</a>.  It "<q>provides FIFO policies for individual workloads, and a
flattened hierarchical vtree for cgroups</q>", and evidently provides
better performance than <tt>SCHED_NORMAL</tt> for an Apache web-serving
benchmark.
<p>
<h4>Prospects</h4>
<p>
This patch set is in its second posting and has, so far, not drawn a lot of
review comments; perhaps it is too big to bikeshed.  Scheduler maintainer
Peter Zijlstra responded to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221130082313.3241517-1-tj@kernel.org/">the first
version</a>, though, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y5b2btWFJeEfTyJg@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">saying</a>:
"<q>I hate all of this. Linus NAK'ed loadable schedulers a number of times
in the past and this is just that again -- with the extra downside of the
whole BPF thing on top</q>".  He then proceeded to review many of the
component patches, though, suggesting that he may not intend to reject this
work outright.
<p>
Even so, the BPF scheduler class will clearly be a large bite for the
core kernel community to swallow.  It adds over 10,000 lines of core code
and exposes many scheduling details that have, thus far, been kept deep
within the kernel.  It would be an acknowledgment that one general-purpose
scheduler cannot optimally serve all workloads; some may worry that it
would mark an end to work on the completely fair scheduler toward that goal
and an increase in fragmentation across Linux systems.  The BPF-scheduling
developers argue the opposite, that the ability to freely experiment with
scheduling models would, instead, accelerate improvements to the completely
fair scheduler.
<p>
How this will play out is hard to predict, other than to note that the BPF
juggernaut has, thus far, managed to overcome just about every objection
that it has encountered.  The days of locking up core-kernel functionality
within the kernel itself seem to be coming to an end.  It will be
interesting to see what new scheduling approaches will be enabled by this
subsystem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm starting to see the real value of this BPF thing. A stable API that doesn't require juggling rapidly bitrotting out-of-tree patchsets for hordes of demanding users, an idiot-proof sandbox for phone manufacturers to put their value-adds in, no more gatekeepers pulling the "rejected, CFS works fine on my $3000 workstation" for 20 years... maybe you *can* solve social problems through technological means.<br>
<p>
Or maybe Linux will proudly make no attempt to keep up with the ongoing tidal wave of mainstream x86/ARM core arrangements that don't fit neatly into a C array and we'll end up with a sequel to the Wasted Cores paper. Right now that looks more likely.<br>

I feel like the first half is half of what I've been feeling about some developments with Linux.<br>
<p>
We are starting to see more and more pluggable and microkernel (userspace) approaches inside the kernel. With drivers, schedulers, LSM I think to some degree even memory allocation (faultfd or whatever the name is).<br>
<p>
Which is great. People can experiment, we get better fault safety for drivers, and if upstream is too slow or (arguably) too much of a nuisance, vendors can still ship drivers.<br>
<p>
<p>
OTOH I really dislike what this enables as well. Vendors get to avoid the GPL. Intel already provides a closed source driver for webcams and touchscreens iirc. by means of having it run in userspace.<br>
<p>
It's a really double edged sword. While we might get more drivers faster/easier to backport, it also reduces the pressure on vendors to "play nice" and especially to provide open implementations of how to talk to their hardware.<br>

I'm not really sure what I feel about pluggable schedulers (it sounds like a good idea superficially, but I don't know the domain enough to emit judgement), but I can't really see why Zijlstra sees the BPF as a worsening over other proposals. IMO that's a net improvement if only because we don't need yet another unstable idiosyncratic API that negates any advantage of the approach in the first place. Even if the idea is bad, BPF sounds like the right way to implement it to me.<br>

Honestly: this line makes me think linux should try to take a stab at the whole M:N scheduling thing again (which AFAIK no implementations, on any OS/kernel, have been successful/performant thus far). With a (small) M:N syscall interface, you could have a scheduling user-space "process". That process should be a realtime scheduled, and then you get the full power of a plug-able scheduler AND the ability to write it in any language you have a runtime/compiler for.<br>

Google Fibers is an M:N in-process scheduling framework that has been used internally at Google for 10+ years, quite successfully. There have been several attempts to upstream the kernel side of it (UMCG, FUTEX_SWAP).<br>

Hmm, I think I'd call Google fibers 1:1, at least in the way most people would mean it. That is, it assigns every userspace thread to a dedicated kernel thread, from the first time the thread function runs, until that function returns.<br>
<p>
The magic seems all about having userspace code choose which threads are runnable at any given time -- ensuring that there's only ever 1 "runnable" thread per CPU the process is allowed to use. The most tricky part of that being the ability to cause a new thread to be made chosen to be runnable if another blocks in the kernel.<br>
<p>
By ensuring this, the kernel scheduler's decisions are made effectively trivial. ("N CPUs are available, and N threads are currently runnable? Ok I know what to do here!")<br>

I think AIX supports M:N scheduling, though I can't say anything about its performance:<br>

Looks like it's unsupported starting from 7.3 as well<br>

This feels like it circles back around to last week's discussion on stable BPF interfaces.<br>
<p>
If folks are given a "use bpf to implement your custom scheduler workload" they'll be super unhappy if they have to rewrite bits of it because the kernel internals changed.<br>

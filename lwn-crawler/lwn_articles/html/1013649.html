One of the many important tasks that the kernel's memory-management
subsystem must handle is keeping track of how pages of memory are mapped
into the address spaces of the processes running on the system.  As long as
mappings to a given page exist, that page must be kept in place.  As it
turns out, tracking these mappings is harder than it seems it should be,
and the move to folios within the memory-management subsystem is adding
some complexities of its own.  As a follow-up to <a
href="/Articles/974223/">the "mapcount madness" session</a> that he ran at
the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">2024 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF summit</a>, David Hildenbrand has posted <a
href="/ml/all/20250303163014.1128035-1-david@redhat.com">a patch series</a>
intended to improve the handling of mapping counts for folios — but exact
accounting remains elusive in some situations.
<p>

In theory, tracking mappings should be relatively straightforward: when a
mapping to a page is added, increment that page's mapping count to match.
The removal of a mapping should lead to an associated decrement of the
mapping count.  But huge pages and large folios complicate this scenario;
they have their own mapping counts that are, essentially, the sum of the
mapping counts for the pages they contain.  It is often important to know
whether a folio as a whole has mappings, so the separate count is useful,
but it brings some complexities.
<p>
For example, one question that the kernel often asks is: how many processes
have mapped a given page or folio?  There are a number of operations that
can be optimized if it is known that a mapping is <i>exclusive</i> — that
the page or folio is mapped by a single process.  The handling of
copy-on-write pages is also hard to execute correctly if the exclusivity of
a given mapping is not known; failures on this front have led to <a
href="/Articles/895439/">some unpleasant bugs</a> in the past.  For a
single page, the exclusivity question is easily enough answered: if the
mapping count is one, the mapping is exclusive, otherwise it is shared.
That rule no longer applies if mapping counts are maintained at the folio
level, though, since the folio-level count will almost never be just one.
<p>
The current scheme also has performance-related problems that folios
could maybe help to improve.  Mapping a traditional PMD-size huge page is
equivalent to mapping 512 base pages; currently, if the entire huge page is
mapped, the mapping count of each of its base pages must be incremented
accordingly.  Incrementing the mapping count on each of those base pages
takes time the kernel developers would rather not spend; it would be a lot
faster to only keep track of a single mapping count at the folio level.
This optimization can only make the exclusivity question even harder to
answer, though, especially in the presence of partially mapped folios
(where only some of its pages are mapped into an address space).
<p>
Thus, it is not surprising the kernel developers have spent years trying to
figure out how to properly manage the mapping counts as memory-management
complexity increases.
<p>
<h4>Make room!</h4>
<p>
To better track mapping counts at the folio level, Hildenbrand first needed
a bit more space in the <tt>folio</tt> structure for some additional
information.  <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.6/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L286"><tt>struct
folio</tt></a> is a bit of a complicated and confusing beast.  As a way of
facilitating the transition to folio use throughout the kernel, this
structure is overlaid on top of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.6/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L35"><tt>struct
page</tt></a>, which describes a single page.  But folios often need to
track more information than can be fit into the tightly packed
<tt>page</tt> structure; this is especially true for large folios that
contain many pages.
<p>
But, since a large folio does contain many pages — and physically
contiguous pages at that — there are some tricks that can be employed.
There is no real need to maintain a full <tt>page</tt> structure for every
page within a folio, since they are managed as a unit; indeed, eliminating
the management of all of those <tt>page</tt> structures is one of the
objectives of the folio transition.  But those <tt>page</tt> structures
exist, laid out contiguously in the system's memory map.  So a large folio
does not have just one <tt>page</tt> structure's worth of memory at its
disposal; it has the <tt>page</tt> structures for all of the component
pages.  The <tt>page</tt> structures for the "tail pages" — those after the
first one — can thus be carefully put to use holding this additional
information.
<p>
If one looks at the definition of <tt>struct folio</tt>, it quickly becomes
clear that it is larger than a single <tt>page</tt> structure.  After the
initial fields that overlay the <tt>page</tt> structure for the head page,
one will find this:
<p>
<pre>
    union {
	struct {
	    unsigned long _flags_1;
	    unsigned long _head_1;
	    atomic_t _large_mapcount;
	    atomic_t _entire_mapcount;
	    atomic_t _nr_pages_mapped;
	    atomic_t _pincount;
    #ifdef CONFIG_64BIT
	    unsigned int _folio_nr_pages;
    #endif
	/* private: the union with struct page is transitional */
	};
	    struct page __page_1;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This piece of the <tt>folio</tt> structure precisely overlays the
<tt>page</tt> structure of the first tail page, assuming such a page
exists.  It contains information intended to help maintain the mapping
count in current kernels, and other relevant fields.  There is also a
<tt>__page_2</tt> component (not shown) that mainly holds information used
by the hugetlbfs subsystem.  As a result, the <tt>folio</tt> structure is
actually the length of three <tt>page</tt> structures, though most of it is
only valid for large (at least four pages) folios.
<p>
As sprawling as this seems, it still lacks the space Hildenbrand needed to
better track mapping counts.  To be able to handle order-1 (two-page)
folios, he needed that space to fit within the page-1 union shown above.  So the
first six patches of the series are dedicated to shuffling fields around in
the <tt>folio</tt> structure, adding a <tt>__page_3</tt> union in the
process.  The <tt>__page_1</tt> union gains some complexity, but the core
of the work is in these new fields:
<p>
<pre>
    mm_id_mapcount_t _mm_id_mapcount[2];
    union {
	mm_id_t _mm_id[2];
	unsigned long _mm_ids;
    };
</pre>
<p>
They will be used to keep better track of the mapping for the folio to
which they belong.  Describing how that is done requires a bit more
background, though.
<p>
<h4>One, two, or many</h4>
<p>
So how does all of this work help to improve the tracking of the mapping
counts for large folios that may be shared between multiple processes and
which can be partially mapped in any one of them?  The starting point is the
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.6/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L803"><tt>mm_struct</tt>
structure</a> that represents a process's address space.  Any time a folio
is mapped, that mapping will belong to a specific process, and thus a
specific <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure.  So the question of whether a folio
is exclusively mapped comes down to whether all of its mappings belong to
the same <tt>mm_struct</tt>.  It is a simple matter of tracking which
<tt>mm_struct</tt> structures hold mappings to the folio.
<p>
Of course, there could be thousands of those structures containing such
mappings; consider that almost every process in the system will have the
C&nbsp;library mapped, for example.  Tracking all of those mappings without
consuming a lot of time and memory would not be an easy task.  But it is
not really important to track every mapping to something like the
C&nbsp;library; the purpose here is to stay on top of the folios that are
exclusively mapped, and thus don't have all those mappings.
<p>
The <tt>_mm_id</tt> array that was added to page&nbsp;1 of the
<tt>folio</tt> structure is intended to serve this purpose; it can track up
to two <tt>mm_struct</tt> structures that have mappings to the folio.  The
most straightforward way to do that would be to just store pointers to
those <tt>mm_struct</tt> structures, but space in the <tt>folio</tt>
structure is still at a premium.  So, instead, a shorter "mm ID" is
assigned to each <tt>mm_struct</tt>, using the kernel's <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/idr.html">ID allocator</a> subsystem.
<p>
When a folio is first created, both <tt>_mm_id</tt> entries are set to
<tt>MM_ID_DUMMY</tt>, indicating that they are unused.  When the time comes
to add a mapping, the kernel will search <tt>_mm_id</tt> for the
appropriate mm&nbsp;ID, then increment the associated
<tt>_mm_id_mapcount</tt> entry to record the new mapping(s).  So, for
example, if eight pages within a folio are mapped into the address space,
the count will be incremented by eight to match.  If the mm&nbsp;ID does
not have an entry in <tt>_mm_id</tt>, the kernel will look for an
<tt>MM_ID_DUMMY</tt> entry to use for this <tt>mm_struct</tt>, then start
tracking the mappings there.
<p>
The kernel is now maintaining multiple mapping counts for this folio.  The
<tt>_large_mapcount</tt> field of the <tt>folio</tt> structure continues to
count all of the mappings to the folio from any address space, as it does
in current kernels.  But there is also the <tt>_mm_id_mapcount</tt> count
for each <tt>mm_struct</tt> tracking the number of mappings associated with
that specific structure.  The question of whether the folio is mapped
exclusively is now easy to answer: if one of the <tt>_mm_id_mapcount</tt>
counters is equal to <tt>_large_mapcount</tt>, then all of the mappings
belong to the associated <tt>mm_struct</tt> and the kernel knows that the
mapping is exclusive.  Otherwise, the mapping is shared.
<p>
The ability to track two <tt>mm_struct</tt> structures handles the most
common case of short-term shared mappings — when a process calls <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
to create a new child process.  That new process will use the second
<tt>_mm_id</tt> slot for the mapping that is now shared between the parent
and the child.  If, as often happens, the child calls <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"><tt>execve()</tt></a>
to run a new program, the shared mapping will be torn down, the child's
<tt>_mm_id</tt> slot will be released, and the kernel will know that the
folio is, again, mapped exclusively.
<p>
There is just one tiny gap in this mechanism, though: what happens when a
third process comes along and maps the folio?  There will be no
<tt>_mm_id</tt> slot available for it, so its mapping(s) cannot be tracked.
Should this happen, the kernel will set a special bit in the <tt>folio</tt>
structure indicating that it no longer has a handle on where all the
mappings to the folio come from, and will treat it as being shared.  This
could result in the kernel mistakenly concluding that a folio is mapped
shared when it is mapped exclusively; the consequence will be worse
performance, but no lack of correctness.  If enough processes unmap the
folio, there could come a time when <tt>_large_mapcount</tt> again aligns
with one of the <tt>_mm_id_mapcount</tt> counts, and the kernel will once
again know that the folio is mapped exclusively.
<p>
<h4>Per-page mapcounts and more</h4>
<p>
The result of all this work is that the kernel has a better handle on
whether any given folio is mapped exclusively or shared, though it may
still occasionally conclude that a folio is shared when it is not.  But
that was not the only objective of this work; Hildenbrand also would like
to do away with the overhead of maintaining the per-page mapping counts in
large folios.  The final part of the patch series is an implementation of
that goal; at the end, the per-page counts are no longer used or maintained.
<p>
The most significant consequence of dropping the per-page mapping counts
appears to be making some of the memory-management statistics provided by
the kernel (the various resident-set sizes, for example) a bit fuzzier.
Hildenbrand suggests that this imprecision should not be a problem, but he
also acknowledges that it will take time to see what the implications
really are.  To avoid surprises during that time, there is a new
configuration parameter, <tt>CONFIG_NO_PAGE_MAPCOUNT</tt>, that controls
whether these changes are effective.  This work is considered experimental
enough that, at this point, Hildenbrand does not want to have it enabled by
default in production kernels.



<p>
There will be a desire to do that at some point, though; dropping the
per-page map counts can make a <tt>clone()</tt> call up to 20% faster for
some workloads, according to performance results included in the patch
cover letter.

<p>
Meanwhile, this work enables another optimization with regard to how some
transparent huge pages are used after a process forks.  In current kernels,
if the huge page (folio) is mapped at the base-page level ("PTE mapped"),
it will not be reused after the fork.  As the use of transparent huge
pages — and, especially, in multi-size huge pages that <i>must</i> be PTE
mapped — grows, reusing those huge pages will become increasingly
important.  Now, with the per-<tt>mm_struct</tt> mapping counts, the kernel
can tell when a process has exclusive access to the huge page and can
continue to use it as such.  This reuse yields significant improvements in
some benchmark results.
<p>
The use of large folios is expected to grow in the future; they are a more
efficient way to manage much of the memory that any given process uses.  So
it is important to optimize that case as much as possible.  Hildenbrand's
patch set makes some steps in that direction while addressing a thorny
problem that has resisted solution for years.  These changes are currently
in the linux-next repository, so there is a reasonable possibility that
they could land in the mainline during the 6.15 merge window.  If so, the
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2025 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit</a>, which will be concurrent
with that merge window, may be the last to feature a "mapcount madness"

No offense to any of the people putting hard work into making the Linux kernel faster but I am increasingly getting the impression that a lot of the systems end up full of these "clever tricks" that might make things a little bit faster but also a lot harder to understand and maintain, especially in a language like C where you can't really encapsulate the internals of data structures very well.<br>

Testing may happen in many ways (with type system being one blessed kind of static checks). Not all kinds of tests are stored in the source code, and not all kinds of tests have to be checked by a compiler/test runner.<br>
<p>
It's a well-known fact in theoretical CS community that type systems need to strike a balance between complexity and expressivity, or they either will be too hard to apply or will reject too many sound programs.<br>
<p>
Lots of code is straightforward, and type systems are helpful, as they cover the common scenarios.<br>
<p>
The desired behaviour in this tiny piece of code though is very complex, as it is shaped by many competing constraints, so expecting a type system that will be designed just right to allow checking these complicated invariants is futile. So testing has to take other forms: manually written tests, code reviews, load testing, fuzzing, custom static checks etc.<br>
<p>
If the correspondence "type system = static check" is not obvious, consider that "variable X is private in class Y" is the same as the static check "variable X inside a struct created by function Y::New can be accessed only by a function named Y::*".<br>

Obviously, easier it is to write static checks, easier it is to have many of them.<br>
<p>
I have never written any kind of static check for C in 30 years, it being too hard to handle, overlaid with preprocessor. Compared to that I have written dozens of application-specific static checks for Go in 5 years. The type systems of both languages are similarly expressive.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; The desired behaviour in this tiny piece of code though is very complex, as it is shaped by many competing constraints, so expecting a type system that will be designed just right to allow checking these complicated invariants is futile. So testing has to take other forms: manually written tests, code reviews, load testing, fuzzing, custom static checks etc.</span><br>
<p>
I'm also getting the impression that if you need a complex type system, you have usually broken Einstein's dictum "make it as simple as possible, but no simpler". Witness the comments about how Rust couldn't type check a common lock pattern, only for someone to ask "why are you doing it that way? It doesn't actually make sense".<br>
<p>
There's the old saw that computerising a broken system merely gives you even more broken system, just faster. Imposing a type system (and modifying the type system to suit) on an excessively complex broken system just gives you an even more complex broken system. You need to refactor the complexity away (and yes, I know that's a damn hard job), and then you'll end up with a much simpler system, and a simple type system.<br>
<p>
And that is clearly the case here. They are trying to refactor away a lot of obviously unnecessary complexity. The big problem is you need to get your head round the complex now before you can safely change it to a simpler future.<br>

The solution space for a given set of requirements is usually vast in our field, with many soltuions being comparably-optimal. So there indeed might be the solutions that are better on the "complexity" axis, and constraining the set of allowed solutions to "not more complex than this" helps to focus the search in this subspace.<br>
<p>
Hotever it is not proven that for any given problem any arbitrary set of constraints delivers a solution that is globally optimal, compared to solutions that are bound by other complexity limit, or being complexity-unbounded.<br>
<p>
Note that I'm not describing specific kinds of requirements: both system behaviour and properties important to the people producing the system may and do shape the solution.<br>

Yes.  Fortunately, adjusting the logic will be fairly simple at this point, as the core logic resides in two functions.<br>
<p>
For example, why not use a single MM slot instead of two? Well, because there are situations (esp. pageout, page migration), where our owner could suddenly change even when only two processes are involved, such as with short-lived fork. So I decided for a *slightly* more complicated approach (two slots, which didn't add that much complexity or runtime overhead after all), which makes the whole thing at least predictable in the common case.<br>
<p>
I suggest to take a look at the introduction of v2 to see "how good" this work was for me ;)<br>

Then there's the problem that "obviously unnecessary" .... is rarely obvious, and usually a sign that the problem is not properly understood.<br>

Heh, this is actually the simplified approach, and not really the fancy version with the real clever tricks I have in my back pocket :)<br>
<p>
The whole "making space in folios" nasty magic is just a temporary thing (primarily to make 32bit support fly!) until Willy manages to allocate "struct folio" separately, then this will just clean up very nicely.<br>
<p>
Note that this work is part of a series of optimizations and cleanups. The munmap() speedup is much more impressive/important than the fork() speedup mentioned in this article. These "a little bit faster" things accumulate. For example, munmap() in some cases was speed up by up to a factor of 4 with larger folios in some of my measurements ever since we started this whole mapcount rework.<br>
<p>
The hardest part is dealing with the legacy stuff and the legacy interfaces that are affected by the per-page mapcounts.<br>
<p>
The mapcount madness is not over yet: some future work (see the cover letter) will make it finally possible to cleanly map folios that are larger than a single PMD (e.g., 4MiB, 8 MiB ...).  Once that is in and the per-page mapcounts are gone for good, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.<br>

For the 'fuzzier' accounting, what sort of userland workloads is this likely to represent in, or 'shift' with this changes?<br>
<p>
I'm mostly idly wondering about potential impacts to OOMK selection in containerized workloads.<br>

I tried to carefully document the details in the relevant patches / documentation files.<br>
<p>
Most importantly, the RSS of a process won't be affected. Further, for most workloads (having many partially-mapped folios) nothing will change really. In the common case (mostly fully mapped large folios), nothing will change at all.<br>
<p>
The only things that can be affected in /proc/$PID/smaps *with large folios / THPs* will be:<br>
<p>
1) PSS:  Proportional Set Size (Pss / Pss_dirty)<br>
<p>
It's confusing; in contrast to the Rss, it's supposed to represent the "Real memory footprint" of a process in a better way, but there are already scenarios where it will be incorrect.<br>
<p>
As we no longer have the per-page mapcount information in large folios, we calculate it based on the per-folio average. So in extreme cases it could be higher or lower (again, only with partially mapped large folios).<br>
<p>
2) USS: Unique Set Size<br>
<p>
"If I kill this process now, how much memory will get freed up". The fuzzy accounting means that you might end up freeing more memory up (something indicates as shared/non-unique although it is exclusive/unique).<br>
<p>
For example, more memory might be indicated as Shared_Clean instead of Private_Clean; same with Shared_Dirty vs. Private_Dirty.<br>
<p>
<p>
Again, for partially-mapped folios the accounting of e.g., "AnonPages", "Mapped" in /proc/meminfo (and similar cgroup/per-node interfaces) can be higher. I am not 100% sure if that will really matter: because these folios *do consume that memory* even when partially mapped. The very last patch in the series documents that.<br>
<p>
Coming back to you question: these are exactly the things we have to learn and why I am being careful. Changes to PSS/USS etc. should not matter, because it's not going to be the common case. Regarding changes to /proc/meminfo, I really don't know yet.<br>

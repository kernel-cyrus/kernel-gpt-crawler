<h1>What's holding up 2.6.14: two difficult bugs</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 18, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Linus was set on releasing the 2.6.14 kernel on October&nbsp;17, when a
little issue came up.  Serge Belyshev <a
href="/Articles/156145/">discovered</a> that it is easy to cause the system
to stop opening files for user-space applications.  He posted a program
which, in essence, does the following:
<p>
<pre>
    while (1) {
        int fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);
	close(fd);
    }
</pre>
<p>
After some 50,000 iterations, the open fails with a "too many open files in
system" message.  This behavior can be problematic in more realistic
situations; it evidently can cause highly-parallel kernel builds to fail,
and it also exposes the system to local denial of service attacks.  So it
is worth tracking down.
<p>
The kernel places a limit on the number of files which are allowed to be
open simultaneously.  That limit is not normally expected to include files
which have been closed, however.  The problem, as it turns out, is a
virtual filesystem scalability patch which was merged in September.
That patch eliminates some locking around <tt>file</tt> structures in the
kernel, and, to that end, defers certain tasks (such as file cleanup) to
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/37889/">read-copy-update</a>
mechanism.  For this particular case, <tt>file</tt> 
structures corresponding to closed files are building up in the RCU
callback list, and RCU is not getting around to freeing them in time.
<p>

Initially, it was thought that the culprit was another patch which put a
limit on the processing of the RCU callback lists.  Those lists can get
quite long, and lengthy callback processing was causing latency problems
elsewhere in the kernel.  So a "batch size" of ten was imposed; after ten
callbacks have been processed, the RCU subsystem defers the rest until
later.  It seemed that this limit was causing the freeing of <tt>file</tt>
structures to languish.  Raising the batch limit to 10,000 seemed to
improve the situation, so Linus merged a patch to that effect.
<p>

But, in fact, the higher batch limit did not solve the problem for real.
RCU callbacks cannot be called immediately after being queued.  They must,
instead, wait until every processor on the system has scheduled at least
once.  This "quiescence" requirement is the kernel's way of ensuring that no
references to the freed structure remain; it's a key part of how RCU
works.  If a process chews through <tt>file</tt> structures quickly enough,
they will accumulate while the kernel waits for the grace period to run
out, and no changes to the batch limits will help.  The only way to be able
to process those callbacks - and free the associated structures - is to
force every processor to schedule.
<p>

A couple of patches have been posted in an attempt to deal with this
problem.  One of them simply changes the way <tt>file</tt> structures are
accounted for - they are removed from the count of open files when the RCU
callback is queued, rather than when it is executed.  This patch stops
programs from running into the maximum open file limit, but does nothing to
stop the growth of the RCU callback queues.  So the patch which got merged,
instead, is <a href="/Articles/156160/">this one from Eric Dumazet</a>,
which keeps track of the length of the callback list.  Should the list get
to be too long (where "too long" is wired at 10,000 entries), a reschedule
is forced so that the callbacks can be processed.  This patch appears to
have dealt with the problem well enough to allow 2.6.14 to come out, though
more refinement may be required afterward.
<p>

Unfortunately for those who are waiting for 2.6.14, another problem turned
up.  Some 64-bit architectures which 
lack I/O memory management units must be very careful in setting up DMA
areas.  A number of devices can only reliably deal with 32-bit DMA
addresses, so DMA areas must be allocated in the lower part of memory.  To
that end, the x86-64 and ia64 architectures use a mechanism called the
"software I/O translation buffer", or swiotlb.  It is simply a large chunk
of low memory, allocated at boot time, which is used as a bounce buffer for
DMA operations involving 64-bit-challenged devices.
<p>

It <a href="/Articles/156162/">was noted</a> that the 2.6.14-rc4 kernel can
allocate the swiotlb area in high memory, which defeats the entire
purpose.  This revelation led to a long discussion of how swiotlb memory
should be allocated.  It turns out that there is no easy way of finding the
low memory on the system.  Once upon a time, that memory would belong to
CPU&nbsp;0, but on <a href="/Articles/156163/">some contemporary NUMA
systems</a>, the low memory might be elsewhere.  So the real solution
appears to iterate through all CPUs on the system, try to allocate from
each of them, and test to see if the resulting memory is within the DMAable
range.  If not, the memory is freed and the next processor is tried.  A
couple of patches implementing this approach are circulating; none has been
merged as of this writing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sorry for my ignorance: can someone explain in few sentences<br>
what are highly-parallel kernel builds ? <br>

      Is going to crop up in arguments about "software engineering" WRT the kernel.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what part it will play, or what the right answer will be, but I know we'll hear about it in the trade press in the next 6 months, probably as a quote from some "analyst".<br>
<p>
We ought to give a little thought to capsulizing what the answer will be.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 1, 2015</br>
           </div>
Progress on the multi-year task of reworking the kernel's control group
("cgroup") mechanism might 
appear to have slowed down recently, but that work continues and, occasionally,
surfaces on the mailing lists.  Recently, cgroup maintainer Tejun Heo <a
href="/Articles/653457/">posted</a> a proposal for the CPU-scheduler
controller interface in the new cgroup subsystem; it changes a
number of control knobs, makes time units consistent across the interface,
and so on.  This proposal generated quite a bit of discussion, but it
wasn't the contents of the new interface that were controversial.  Instead,
it became clear that some users are not at all happy about a feature that
is absent from this interface â€” and which may have to be restored before
this work can go forward.
<p>
The new "unified hierarchy" cgroup interface was <a href="/Articles/571977/">a
topic of discussion</a> at the 2013 Kernel Summit.  At that gathering,
Tejun stated his intent to make cgroups handle membership at the process
level, but not below.  If a process is made up of multiple threads, all of
those threads will be placed into the same group as a unit.  That
is a change from the current cgroup implementation, which allows different
threads to be placed in different groups.  Eliminating that capability,
Tejun said, makes the implementation much more straightforward and, in any
case, most controllers only make sense at the process level anyway.
<p>
At the time, there were some expressions of concern from the gathered
developers, not all of whom were convinced that losing the ability to split
a process's threads across control groups would be acceptable.  No
definitive conclusion on the issue was reached at the time; further
discussion was deferred until the code itself made an appearance.  Two
years later, that code is out but the worries have not gone away; scheduler
developer Peter Zijlstra was 
quick to <a href="/Articles/656116/">raise the issue</a> again.
<p>
A few users of thread-level cgroup control surfaced in the ensuing
discussion; the most vocal of them was Paul Turner of
Google, who <a href="/Articles/656117/">asserted</a> that this ability is
an important part of how systems are managed there.  One use case mentioned was
the division of a job into work and support threads.  The threads doing the
"real work" should get the bulk of the available CPU time, but an
application will typically want to guarantee a minimum of time to the
support threads as well.  Putting the two types of threads into different
control groups allows this policy to be implemented in a fairly
straightforward way.
<p>
Tejun's response took a few different forms.  One was to question the
importance of this use case; he <a href="/Articles/656118/">described</a>
it as "<q>super duper fringe</q>" at one point.  He also suggested
that the problem could be solved using process priorities, but Paul <a
href="/Articles/656120/">clearly stated</a> that priorities are not a
suitable solution to the problem, while cgroups are.  It seems clear that a
number of users beyond Google  employ control groups in this manner now
and they would not be happy if this ability were to be left out of the new
cgroup interface.  If nothing else, leaving it out would tend to inhibit
movement away from the old interface which, in turn, would make that API's
eventual removal an even more distant prospect.
<p>
The other significant <a href="/Articles/656119/">point</a> argued by Tejun
is that the cgroup interface is not a good way for applications to manage
their environment.  It may work as a system-administration interface, he
said, but application developers should be given a more programmatic,
system-call-based interface.  Such an interface would be more easily used
by those developers, he said, and separating the administrative and
application interfaces would help to prevent conflicts between the
administrator and the application over thread-level
management. 
<p>
In <a href="/Articles/656121/">this message</a> Tejun briefly sketched out
the "resource group" API that he has in mind.  These groups could be
created and managed within an application with a new
<tt>set_resource()</tt> system call.  
<p>
Finally, Tejun argued that, rather than using cgroups for grouping of
threads, the kernel should just employ the
normal process hierarchy for that purpose; the <tt>set_resource()</tt> system
call follows that guideline.  Additionally, new threads could be created with
a special <tt>clone()</tt> flag that would cause them to be placed into a
new resource group.  The process hierarchy is
already understood by application developers, he said, and can be
manipulated with existing system calls.  If developers use that hierarchy 
to partition their applications, they will have better results and the
complexity of supporting thread-level cgroup membership can be avoided.
<p>
The API itself was not discussed much; the discussion was more about
identifying the problem than nailing down the details of its solution.
There appears to be some concern about moving away from the cgroup API for
thread-level management, but developers could probably be convinced on that
score if the new API looked good enough; the current API has few overt
admirers, after all.  There was some resistance to the idea of limiting
grouping to the process hierarchy, though.  It seems that a number of use cases
involve moving threads from one control group to another, depending on just
what a specific thread is doing at any given time.  A grouping mechanism
that was strictly based on the process hierarchy would not be able to move
processes in that way.
<p>
The end of the discussion came when <a href="/Articles/656122/">Ingo
Molnar</a> and <a href="/Articles/656123/">Peter</a> both indicated that
they would block further work on the CPU cgroup controller until the
problem of per-thread control had been resolved.  The issue, they said, is
fundamental to the design of the subsystem, and it is not reasonable to
expect that a solution can be retrofitted in after this code is merged.
Tejun has not, as of this writing, indicated how he intends to proceed,
whether it be by allowing per-thread control-group membership or through a
separate control API.  Either way, further progress in this area cannot be
expected until a solution to this particular problem is
presented and accepted by the relevant maintainers.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sort of capability is most useful for applications where the programmers didn't take into account that users/admins may want to do something like this.<br>
<p>
As a result, any solution that starts out with "change the source" is going to fail.<br>

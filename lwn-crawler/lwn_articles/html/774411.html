           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2018-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
<p>In the RDMA microconference of the  2018 <a 
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a> (LPC),
John Hubbard, Dan Williams, and Matthew Wilcox led a discussion on the
problems surrounding <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> (and friends) and the
interaction with DMA.  It is not the first time the topic has come up,
there was also a <a href="/Articles/753027/">discussion</a> about it at the
Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit back in April.  In
a nutshell, the problem is that multiple parts of the kernel think they
have responsibility for the same chunk of memory, but they do not
coordinate their activities; as might be guessed, mayhem can sometimes ensue.
</p>

<p>
Hubbard began by laying out the goals of the session.  The idea is to make
sure everyone knows about the problem; even though it has been discussed in
various mailing-list threads and such, everyone may not be up to speed on
it.  He was hoping to get a consensus on a long-term fix;  he has put out a
few RFCs, but the solutions have been a bit contentious.
</p>

<p>
It is not that difficult to crash the kernel using a common code pattern,
he said.  An application  pins pages in memory, which causes the kernel to use
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> or similar to map the user-space memory into the
kernel's address space.
It then sets up DMA for the pages.  Though it
was the <i>R</i>DMA microconference, the problem exists for all DMA operations
(for, say, a GPU or FPGA),
not just remotely over the network, Hubbard said.
The drivers will then mark the destination pages as dirty and release them
with <tt>put_page()</tt> (or <tt>release_pages()</tt>).
But if the pages are
backed by a non-RAM-based filesystem, things can go awry.  This pattern has
been "known" to be reasonable since 2005 or so, but it is actually broken.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/774494/">

align="left" alt="[John Hubbard &amp; Dan Williams]"
title="John Hubbard (l) &amp; Dan Williams (r)" width=300 height=200>
</a>

<p>
The underlying problem is that the page buffers can be stripped off while
the page is pinned and undergoing I/O; the writeback code believes it has
written the dirty data, thus the buffers are not needed, but then the
driver marks the pages dirty again when the I/O completes.  Once that
happens, writeback may come  
along (again) expecting that the page buffers are still there.  Essentially, the
filesystem is unaware that a page can be marked dirty outside of its
purview.  There are two subsystems that do not agree on which is the
maintainer of the dirty state.  All of that means that DMA to file-backed
memory is not truly supported by Linux today, he said.
</p>

<p>
Hubbard went into some more detail on the crash, which can be seen in his
<a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/126/attachments/136/168/LPC_2018_gup_dma.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a> that also reference a <a
href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mm/msg142700.html">lengthy
email</a> from Jan Kara about the problem.  Kara was listed as one of the
session leads, but he could not make it to LPC.
</p>

<p>
In answer to a question from an attendee, Hubbard said that the buffers are
being freed because reclaim thinks it is going to get further than it
does.  It cannot progress because <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> has taken a
reference to the pages.  Reclaim has already released the buffers, but 
then has to back out.  Williams added that if reclaim stays out of the way,
everything works just fine;  the problems occur when reclaim gets to the
pages before the driver does.
</p>

<p>
Mel Gorman said that filesystems fundamentally assume that
<tt>page_mkwrite()</tt> will be called before a page can be marked dirty.
So when reclaim comes along, the page may be dirty, but the filesystem
thinks it is safe to get rid of the buffers.  He noted that dirty is not
really a binary state.
</p>

<p>
Someone asked how big of a problem this is, does it occur every day, week,
or month?  Hubbard said it is reliably reproducible for him; he has advised
customers to avoid doing DMA to file-backed memory.  But it is rare enough
that people write this kind of code, test it successfully, and then it
fails when it is deployed in a more stressful scenario, an attendee said.
Another suggested that the less reproducible a bug is, the more important
it is to fix it.  Hubbard agreed, saying he remembered a bug that took a
month to reproduce, which meant it ended up taking him a year to fix it.
Wilcox added that it definitely needs fixing as more and more systems are
running into it.
</p>

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<p>
Hubbard then proposed that <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> "make a note" in the
page structure that effectively 
says "<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> was here".  One problem is that
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> is 
full—a perennial problem.  An idea that Wilcox had come up with is to use
the LRU next and previous pointers in <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> for flags
and a reference count to track 
this;  the pages would be removed from the LRU list while they are pinned,
Hubbard said.
</p>

<p>
The way Hubbard is proposing to do this is to replace all of the
affected <tt>put_page()</tt> and <tt>release_pages()</tt> calls with new
<tt>put_user_page*()</tt> calls that will call <tt>put_page()</tt> after
dealing with the tracking information and restoring the pages to the LRU
list.  His <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20181110085041.10071-1-jhubbard@nvidia.com/">RFC 
patch set</a> converts the InfiniBand driver, but there are around 100
other places that need to be converted.  Some of those will need a fair
amount of analysis to determine how to convert them, he said.
</p>

<p>
Williams cautioned that he is using the LRU pointers in DAX and that Jérôme 
Glisse is also using them in his heterogeneous memory management (HMM)
patches.   Wilcox admonished that he had freed up "a lot of space" in
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> for DAX and HMM; "there's going to be space for
both of you".    It is important to fix this, Hubbard said,
since nothing stops users from doing it, as they have since 2005;  "it just
doesn't work", Williams added.
</p>

<p>
After the first RFC was posted, Andrew Morton asked how Hubbard was
going to ensure that all of the conversions have been done.
There is a need to not only solve the problem, but to show that it has been
solved.  To that end, he wants to add an assertion into the code that will
trigger if <tt>put_user_pages()</tt> has not been called when it should
have been.  He needs a bit in <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt> to track
that, however.  Wilcox said that he had another bit Hubbard could use,
especially if it was only a temporary use while the conversion was in progress;
"I've been saving it for you John", Wilcox said with a grin.  Williams cautioned
that "the first bit is free"—to widespread laughter.
</p>

<p>
Part of what he is trying to accomplish in the session is to raise
awareness that this patch set is coming, Hubbard said.  The RFC is just six
patches that includes the InfiniBand conversion, which has been reviewed by
Infiniband developers.  But he wants to take some time to go into each
subsystem and make sure that he understands how it is using the memory.  For
now, there is a dummy <tt>put_user_page()</tt> that simply does a
<tt>put_page()</tt>.  
</p>

<p>
All of the work he had described so far just tracks the pages that have been pinned with
<tt>get_user_page()</tt>.  Once you have that information, you need to do
something with it.  Stopping the buffer removal is needed and can be done
by  holding off <tt>try_to_unmap()</tt>
for those pages.
But filesystem developers say that holding pages in that state is not a
good idea, so Kara and others have said that the kernel could 
still allow writeback, but do it with
bounce buffers that will be unaffected by whatever else is done with those
pages. 
</p>

<h4><tt>revoke()</tt></h4>

<p>
Williams said that he wanted to talk about APIs for <tt>revoke()</tt>,
which would help with these problems where an <tt>mmap()</tt> region is
shared and being used for DMA.  If
another process wants to truncate or punch a hole in the file in the region
where DMA is being done, "you are screwed", at least for DAX.
</p>

<p>
But, as he has in the past, Glisse pointed out that there are some things
that cannot be revoked.  It will only work on devices that support it.
Some drivers can stop the DMA, but others just pin the memory and have no way
to stop the DMA and unpin the memory.  Wilcox said that it is hardware dependent
and, even for NVMe, which has a command to cancel outstanding I/O, most
devices just do not implement it.  That memory cannot be reused until the
hardware says it won't DMA there anymore, he said.  Williams suggested
that the <tt>revoke()</tt> call should just wait for the device, but for some
devices that wait might be forever, an 
attendee said.
</p>

<p>
Everything that calls <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> needs to be audited, but
Williams was concerned that some drivers don't really know whether their
pages have come from <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> or not.  Hubbard said that
he had to pass some extra tracking information down in some of his
under-development conversions.  If he could permanently
free up a bit in the page structure to track whether these were pages
pinned with <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, Wilcox wondered, would that remove
the need to change all of the call sites, since <tt>put_page()</tt> could
simply do the right thing?
</p>

<p>
There was some thought that might work, but it didn't last long.  There
would be no way to distinguish other uses of <tt>put_page()</tt> from one
that should do that "right thing".  There would be a reference count, but
there is no way to know that any given <tt>put_page()</tt> is the one from
the driver that should clear the bit.  So the call sites in the drivers
still would need to change.  It would help tracking these kinds of pages so
that the extra information would not have to be passed down from upper
layers, however.
</p>

<p>
The performance numbers that accompanied the RFC patches were questioned by
an attendee.  While they showed little performance impact for the changes,
the numbers were 
orders of magnitude lower than what these kinds of devices should be able
to do.  The concern is that the numbers are so low that they shouldn't even
be compared to determine what impact, if any, the changes actually made.  As can be
seen in a <a 
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/942cb823-9b18-69e7-84aa-557a68f9d7e9@talpey.com/">thread</a> from
after LPC, there was a measurement problem; once it was resolved, though,
the impact still is minimal.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the subject of <tt>revoke()</tt>, Williams said that his goal
was to get rid of the distinction between short-term and long-term DMA.
That distinction was added so that DAX could simply fail any attempt to use its memory
for long-term DMA.  It is not just RDMA that does it; there are other
devices, such as video-offload devices, that also pin memory forever.  He
suggested that maybe file leases could provide a model for handling the
problem.  if another process does a file truncate operation, the lease
mechanism could provide a way to pull that memory away from the device.
</p>

<p>
Jason Gunthorpe suggested simply failing the truncation operation when the
memory is in use for DMA.  Wilcox said that he had been advocating that for
years, but that other kernel developers will not allow it.
</p>

<p>
The pages belong to the filesystem, Boaz Harrosh said, so the mistake is in
letting other parts of the kernel handle them in ways the filesystem cannot
see.   He suggested that DMA users take out a range lock for the part of
the file that is being used for DMA, but Williams said that they cannot
"rewrite the universe" to say that everyone must get a range lock.  That
will also have performance impacts that are unacceptable, Wilcox said.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that there are no easy solutions, but the planned path seemed
agreeable to most.  Wilcox pointed out that by removing the pages from the
LRU list in <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>, writeback would never find them, so
the crash cannot occur.  For 
DAX, things are not so rosy, but the RDMA developers seemed willing to try
to handle being told the memory they had pinned for DMA was going away, at
least in exceptional circumstances.  It certainly seems like a topic that
will come up again—possibly multiple times over the next few years.

That attendee was Tom Talpey of Microsoft, FWIW. That's relevant because of his subsequent contributions on the mailing list thread leading to the performance anomalies being understood (debug options are your friend unless you're doing performance measurements).<br>

How is the company he works for relevant to his contribution? Giving recognition to the person is fine, but rarely would you see the company being mentioned.<br>

Of course when it's mentioned it's suddenly microsoft, which looks very suspiciously like you were instructed to mention them as much as you can to try and change their image...<br>

<p>
Something which didn't seem to be understood by all attendees was that you don't even need fancy equipment like a GPU or FPGA.  This also happens with O_DIRECT; the page is pinned while under I/O, so if the VM decides to write it back at the same time we have it pinned, we hit this problem.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Jason Gunthorpe suggested simply failing the truncation operation when the memory is in use for DMA. Wilcox said that he had been advocating that for years, but that other kernel developers will not allow it.</font><br>
<p>
What about allowing the file to be truncated, but keeping the space reserved until the DMA is finished? It would be like deleting a file which a process still has open—worst case, the space doesn't get freed up until the next system reset.<br>

That isn't how filesystems work today. I must admit to having not asked the ext4 or XFS maintainers about this possibility, but I think I know their answer.<br>

This was one of the proposals the preceded dax_layout_busy_page(). I opted for a solution that could be done generically across filesystems. I believe we could revisit, but I don't see what it offers over page-waiting since we'll still need all the same busy-tracking. Doing it in terms of a "layout" management also follows the concept and intercept points for managing pnfs4 layouts.<br>

There are two problems with keeping blocks allocated:<br>
<p>
1) You need work in each filesystem to keep track of these blocks, properly free them in case of system crash so that they don't leak etc. So doable but non-trivial work and on-disk format change for each filesystem that wants to support this.<br>
<p>
2) These pinned but truncated blocks will be invisible to most tools. So sysadmin may have hard time seeing where his blocks are gone. Just remember the pain with open-and-unlinked files. People still get surprised by the behavior and ask "where has my space gone?".<br>

Understood, but filesystems *already* have to support keeping blocks allocated since open files can be unlinked. The same goes for the admin's view of free space. Why not use the same mechanism for blocks which are currently being DMA'd? The tooling issue could be addressed by providing a way for filesystems to report the number of pinned blocks waiting to be freed.<br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure that the on-disk format change, at least, isn't necessary. The filesystem can just mark the blocks as free on disk while keeping a separate record in RAM of nominally "free" blocks which shouldn't be reused quite yet. That also takes care of ensuring that the blocks don't leak without requiring any recovery code to run when the filesystem is mounted.<br>

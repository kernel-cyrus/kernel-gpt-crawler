<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 18, 2020</br>
           </div>
When Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whCKhxNyKn1Arut8xUDKTwp3fWcCj_jbL5dbzkUmo45gQ@mail.gmail.com/">released
the 5.10 kernel</a>, he noted that the 5.11 merge window would run up
against the holidays.  He indicated strongly that maintainers should send
him pull requests early as a result.  Maintainers appear to have listened;
over 10,000 non-merge changesets were pulled into the mainline in the first
three days of the 5.11 merge window.  Read on for a summary of the most
significant changes in that flood of patches.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for Intel's <a href="/Articles/786487/">software guard
     extensions</a> (SGX) finally made it into the kernel after 41
     revisions on the mailing lists.  Some information can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3fa97bf00126">this documentation
     commit</a>.
<li> In the ongoing effort to crack down on user-space access to x86
     model-specific registers (MSRs), writes to
     <tt>MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS</tt> are no longer allowed.  There is <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/about/">a
     document</a> being constructed with a list of tools that perform
     writes to MSRs, with the eventual goal of finding better solutions for
     all of them.
<li> The arm64 architecture can now expose tag bits on addresses (the
     uppermost bits that are not used as part of the virtual address) to
     signal handlers if the <tt>SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS</tt> option has been set
     with <a
     href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><tt>sigaction()</tt></a>.
     This provides access to, among other things, <a
     href="/Articles/834289/">memory type extension</a> keys in pointers.
<li> Support for Microblaze systems without a memory-management unit has
     been removed; it would seem that there are no longer any users of such
     systems.
<li> The MIPS architecture has gained support for coverage testing with
     gcov.      
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new <a href="/Articles/826313/">system-call interception
     mechanism</a>, based on <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>,
     that allows user space to trap and emulate system 
     calls.  The target use case is running Windows games, but other
     applications seem likely as well.
<li> The <a
     href="http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
     system call now provides <a 
     href="/Articles/819834/">the ability to disable handling of kernel-mode
     faults</a> as a security-enhancing measure.
<li> The BPF subsystem has gained support for task-local storage — data
     that lives with a given task.  The first user is the BPF Linux
     security module (formerly <a href="/Articles/808048/">KRSI</a>).
<li> The accounting of memory used by BPF programs has changed completely.
     There is now a control-group controller providing fine-grained
     management of memory use; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/97306be45fbe">this merge commit</a>
     for (some) information.
<li> The BTF mechanism, providing information about kernel types for BPF
     programs (and more), has been extended to kernel modules.
<li> The io_uring subsystem has gained support for the
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html"><tt>shutdown()</tt></a>,
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/renameat2.2.html"><tt>renameat2()</tt></a>,
     and <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unlinkat.2.html"><tt>unlinkat()</tt></a>
     system calls.
<li> Calls to <tt>io_uring_enter()</tt> can now specify a timeout value.
     Adding this feature requires changing the API of that
     system call; 
     this was done by adding a new flag (<tt>IORING_FEAT_EXT_ARG</tt>) to
     indicate the presence of the timeout argument.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The Btrfs filesystem has a couple of new mount options intended
     to help with the unwelcome task of rescuing data off a corrupted
     filesystem.  Using <tt>rescue=ignorebadroots</tt> will cause a mount
     to try to proceed with a corrupted extent root, while
     <tt>rescue=ignoredatacsums</tt> turns off data checksum verification.
<li> Re-exporting a filesystem mounted over NFS is now considered to be a
     supported operation.
<li> The <tt>close_range()</tt> system call has <a
     href="/Articles/837816/">gained a new <tt>CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC</tt>
     option</a>.  When that option is specified, the indicated file descriptors
     are marked close-on-exec rather than closed immediately.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Crypto</b>:

<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     Hirschmann Hellcreek TSN switches,
     Samsung S3FWRN82 UARTs, and
     OpenCompute TimeCard clocks.
<li> <b>Pin control and GPIO</b>:
     Qualcomm LPASS LPI, 8953, SC7280, and SDX55 pin controllers,
     Intel Lakefield, Elkhart Lake, and Alder Lake-S pin controllers, and
     Microsemi/Microchip serial GPIO controllers.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     NXP audio transceivers,
     Mediatek MT8192 audio interfaces,
     Nuvoton NAU8315 class-D amplifiers,
     Analog Devices ADAU1372 codecs, and
     Realtek RT715 SDCA codecs.
<li> It's also worth noting that there has been more than the usual number
     of obsolete drivers removed during this merge window.  Quite a bit of
     cleanup has been happening across the driver subsystem.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for the <a href="/Articles/840416/">auxiliary bus</a>, a
     virtual bus for multi-function devices, has been added.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The 802.1Q "connectivity fault management" mechanism is
     now supported.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6e2b243db4dc">this merge
     message</a> for (a bit) more information.
<li> Support for the WiMAX protocol has been moved to staging with the
     intent of removing it altogether in the near future.  It would appear
     that this support has not actually worked for some time, so the number
     of users is thought to be zero.
<li> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6951">RFC 6951</a> — UDP
     encapsulation of the SCTP protocol — is now supported.
<li> Zero-copy TCP receives have seen a number of performance improvements,
     making this feature worthwhile for much smaller payloads; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/43be3a3c65ff">this merge
     message</a> for more information.
<li> There is a pair of new <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls to facilitate the
     bridging of PPP channels; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/563b603bd65d">this commit</a> for
     some documentation.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
     system call has gained support for <a 
     href="/Articles/834785/">constant-action bitmaps</a>.  This is a
     mechanism allowing <tt>seccomp()</tt> to determine that specific
     system calls are always allowed or denied and short out much of the
     processing work for those calls.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The arm64 and  s390 architectures have <a
     href="/Articles/832121/">removed <tt>set_fs()</tt></a>.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/836503/">migration disable</a> functionality
     has been merged.  The realtime tree has had this capability for years,
     but there is increasing need for it in the mainline as well.
<li> One user of migration disable is the <a
     href="/Articles/836144/"><tt>kmap_local()</tt> API</a>, which has also
     been merged.
</ul>
<p>

By the normal schedule, the 5.11 merge window should close on
December&nbsp;27, but Torvalds has indicated that he might delay the 5.11-rc1
release if he falls behind on pull requests due to the holidays.  The pace
of merging thus far suggests, though, that nobody should count on the merge
window lasting any longer than usual.  As always, we'll post another
summary once the merge window closes, whenever that may be.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The accounting of memory used by BPF programs has changed completely. There is now a control-group controller providing fine-grained management of memory use; </font><br>

No new controller, that would be pretty bad (heavyweight and annoyingly user-visible). Instead, the allocations are made visible to the memory controller, so everything happens &quot;automagically&quot; thanks to existing infrastructure.<br>

As part of the Android + Graphics micro-conference at the <a
href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013/">2013 Linux Plumbers
Conference</a>, we'll be discussing
the <a href="/Articles/480055/">ION memory allocator</a> and how its
functionality might be upstreamed to the mainline
kernel. Since time will be limited, I
wanted to create some background documentation to try to provide context
to the issues we will discuss and try to resolve at the micro-conference.
<p>
<h4>ION overview</h4>
<p>
The main goal of Android's ION subsystem is to allow for allocating and
sharing of buffers between hardware devices and user space in order to
enable zero-copy memory sharing between devices.

This sounds simple enough, but in practice it's a difficult problem. On
system-on-chip (SoC) hardware, there are usually many different devices that have direct
memory access (DMA). These devices, however, may have different
capabilities and can view and access memory with different constraints.
For example, some devices may handle scatter-gather lists, while others
may be able to only access physically contiguous pages in memory. Some
devices may have access to all of memory, while others may only access a
smaller portion of memory. Finally, some devices might sit behind an
I/O memory management unit (IOMMU), which may require configuration to give
the device access to 
specific pages in memory.
<p>
If you have a buffer that you want to share with a device, and the
buffer isn't allocated in memory that the device can access, you have to
use bounce 
buffers to copy the contents of that memory over to a location where the
other devices can access 
it. This can be expensive and greatly hurt performance. So the ability to
allocate a buffer in a location accessible by all the devices
using the buffer is important.
<p>
Thus ION provides an interface that allows for centralized allocation of
different "types" of memory (or "heaps"). 
In current kernels without ION, if you're trying to share memory
between a DRM graphics device and a video4linux (V4L) camera, you
need to be sure to allocate the memory using the subsystem that manages
the most-constrained device. Thus, if the camera is the most constrained
device, you need to do your allocations via the V4L kernel interfaces,
while if the graphics is the most constrained device, you have to do the
allocations via the Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) interfaces.
ION instead provides one single centralized interface that allows
applications to allocate memory that satisfies the required constraints.
<p>
One thing that ION doesn't provide, though, is a method for determining what
type of memory satisfies the constraints of the relevant hardware.
This is instead a problem left to the device-specific user-space
implementations doing the allocation ("Gralloc," in the case of Android).
This hard-coded constraint solving isn't ideal, but there are not
any better mainline solutions for allocating buffers with GEM and
V4L. User space just has to know what is the most-constrained device. On
mostly static hardware devices, like phones and tablets, this information
is known ahead of time, but this limitation  makes ION less suitable for
upstream adoption in its current form.
<p>
To share these buffers, ION exports a file descriptor which is linked
to a specific buffer. These file descriptors can be then passed between
applications and to ION-enabled drivers. Initially these were ION-specific
file descriptors, but ION has since been reworked to utilize
<a href="/Articles/474819/">dma-buf</a> structures for sharing. One caveat is that while ION can export
dma-bufs it won't import dma-bufs exported from other drivers.
<p>
<h4>ION cache management</h4>
<p>
Another major role that ION plays as a central buffer allocator and
manager is handling cache maintenance for DMA. Since many devices
maintain their own memory
caches, it's important that, when serializing device and CPU access to shared
memory, those devices and CPUs flush their private caches before letting other devices
access the buffers. Providing a full background on caching would be out
of the scope of this article, so I'll instead point folks to <a 
href="/Articles/282250/">this LWN
article</a> if they are interested in learning more.

<p>
ION allows for buffer users to set a flag describing the needed cache
behavior on allocations. 
This allows those users to specify if mappings to the buffer should be cached
with ION doing the cache maintenance, if the buffers will be uncached but
use write-combining (see <a href="/Articles/440221/">this article</a> for details),
or if the buffers will be uncached and managed explicitly via ION's
synchronization <tt>ioctl()</tt>.
<p>
In the case where the buffers are cached and ION performs cache
maintenance, ION further tries to allow for optimizations by delaying
the creation of any mappings at <tt>mmap()</tt> time. Instead, it provides a fault handler
so pages are mapped in only when they are accessed.  This method allows ION to
keep track of the changed pages and only flush pages that were
actually touched.
<p>
Also, when ION allocates memory for uncached buffers, it is managing
physical pages which aren't mapped into kernel space yet. Since these
buffers may be used by DMA before they are mapped into kernel space, it is
not correct to flush them at mapping time; that could result in data
corruption. 
So these buffers have to be pre-flushed for DMA when they are allocated. So
another performance optimization ION provides is that it pre-flushes pools
of pages for DMA. On some systems, flushing memory for DMA on frequent
small buffer allocations is a major performance penalty. Thus ION uses a
page pool, which allows a large pool of uncached pages to be
pre-allocated and flushed all at once, then when smaller allocations are
made they just pick pages from the pool.
<p>
Unfortunately both of these optimizations are somewhat problematic from
an upstream perspective.
<p>
Delayed mapping creation is problematic because the DMA API uses either
scatter-gather 
lists or larger contiguous DMA areas; there isn't a generic
interface to flush a single page. Because of this, when ION tries to
flush only the pages that have been touched, it ends up using the
ARM-specific <tt>__dma_page_cpu_to_dev()</tt> function, as it was too costly to
iterate across the scatter-gather lists to find the faulted page. The
use of this interface makes ION only buildable on 32-bit ARM systems.
<p>
The pre-flushed page pools are also problematic: since these pools
of memory are allocated ahead of time, it's not necessarily clear which
device is going to be using them. Normally, when flushing pages for DMA,
one must specify the device which will access the memory next, so in the
case of a device behind an IOMMU, that IOMMU can be set up so the device can
access those pages. ION gets away with this again by using the 32-bit
ARM-specific <tt>__dma_page_cpu_to_dev()</tt> interface, which does not
take a device 
argument. Thus this further limits ION's ability to function in more
generic environments where IOMMUs are more common.
<p>
For Android's uses, this limitation isn't problematic. 32-bit ARM is its
main target, and, on Intel systems there is coherent memory and fewer
device-specific constraints, so ION isn't needed there. Further, for
Android's use cases, IOMMUs can be statically configured to specific heaps
(boot-time reserved carve-out memory, for example) so it's not necessary to
dynamically reconfigure the IOMMUs. But these limitations are problematic for
getting ION upstream. The problem is that without these optimizations
the performance penalty will be too high, so Android is unlikely to
make use of more upstream-friendly approaches that leave out these
optimizations.
<p>

<h4>Other ION details</h4>
<p>
Since ION is a centralized allocator, it has to be somewhat flexible in
order to handle all the various 
types of hardware. So ION allows
implementations to define their own heaps beyond the common heaps
provided by default. Also, since many devices can have quirky allocation
rules, such as allocating on specific DIMM banks, ION allows some of the
allocation flags to be defined by the heap implementation.
<p>
It also provides an <tt>ION_IOC_CUSTOM</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> multiplexer which  
allows ION implementations to implement their own buffer operations,
such as finer-grained cache management or special allocators. However,
the downside to this is that it makes the ION interface actually quite
hardware-specific — in some cases, specific devices require fairly large
changes to the ION core. As a result, user-space applications that use the
ION interface must be customized to use the specific ION implementation for
the hardware they are running on. Again, this isn't really a problem for
embedded devices where kernels and user space are delivered together, so
strict ABI consistency isn't required, but is an issue for merging
upstream.
<p>
This hardware- and implementation-specific nature of ION also brings into
question the viability of the centralized allocator approach ION uses.
In order to enable the various features of all the different
hardware, it basically has hardware-specific interfaces, forcing the
writing of 
hardware-specific user-space applications. This removes some of the conceptual
benefit of having a centralized allocator rather than using device
specific allocators. However, the Android developers have reasoned that,
by having a ION be a centralized memory manager, they can
reduce the amount of complex code each device driver has to implement
and allows for optimizations to be made once in the core, rather than
over and over to various drivers of differing quality.
<p>
To summarize the issues around ION:
<ul>
<li> It does not provide a method to discover device constraints.
<p>
<li> The interface exposes hardware-specific heap IDs to user space.
<p>
<li> The centralized interface isn't sufficiently generic for all devices, so
     it exposes an <tt>ioctl()</tt> multiplexer for device-specific options.
<p>
<li> ION only imports dma-bufs from itself.
<p>
<li> It doesn't properly use the DMA API, failing to specify a device when
     flushing caches for DMA.
<p>
<li> ION only builds on 32-bit ARM systems.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>ION compared to current upstream solutions</h4>
<p>
In some ways GEM is a similar memory allocation and sharing system. It
provides an API for allocating graphics buffers that can be used by an
application to communicate with graphics drivers. Additionally, GEM
provides a way for an application to pass an allocated buffer to another
process. To do this one uses the <tt>DRM_IOCTL_GEM_FLINK</tt> operation,
which provides a GEM-specific reference that is conceptually similar to a
file descriptor 
that can be passed to another process over a socket. One drawback with
this is that these GEM-specific "flink" references are just a global 32-bit
value, and thus can be guessed by applications which otherwise should not
have access to them. Another problem with GEM-allocated buffers is that
they are specific to the device they were allocated for. Thus, while GEM
buffers could be shared between applications, there is no way to share
GEM buffers between different devices.
<p>
With the advent of hybrid graphics implementations (usually discrete
NVIDIA GPUs combined with integrated Intel GPUs), the need for sharing
buffers between devices arose and dma-bufs and PRIME 
(a GEM-specific mechanism for sharing buffers between devices) were created.
<p>
For the most part, dma-bufs can be considered to be marshaling structures for
buffers. The dma-buf system doesn't provide any method for allocation,
but provides a generic structure that can be used to to share buffers
between a number of different devices and applications. The dma-buf
structures are shared to user space using a file descriptor, which avoids
the potential security issues with GEM flink IDs.
<p>
The DRM PRIME infrastructure allows drivers to share GEM buffers via
dma-bufs, which allows for things like having the Nouveau driver be able
to render directly into a buffer that the Intel driver will display to
the screen. In this way GEM and PRIME together provide functionality
similar to that of ION, allowing for the type of buffer sharing (both
utilizing dma-bufs) that ION enables on SoCs on more conventional
desktop machines. However PRIME does not handle any 
information about what kind of memory the device can access, it just
allows for GEM drivers to utilize dma-buf sharing, assuming all the devices
sharing the buffer can access it.
<p>
The V4L subsystem, which is used for cameras and video recorders, also has
integrated dma-buf functionality, allowing camera buffers to be
shared with graphics cards and other devices. It provides its own
allocation interfaces but, like GEM, these allocation interfaces only
make sure the buffer being allocated works with the device that the
driver manages, and are unaware of what constraints other drivers the
buffer might be shared with have.
<p>
So with the current upstream approach, in order to share buffers between
devices, user space must know which devices will share the buffer 
and which device has the most restrictive constraints; it must then allocate
the buffer using the API that most-constrained driver uses.
Again, much like in the ION case, user space has no
method available in order to determine which device is most-constrained.
<p>
The upstream issues can thus be summarized this way:
<ul>
<li> There is no existing solution for constraint-solving for sharing buffers
     between devices.
<p>
<li> There are different allocation APIs for different devices, so, once users
     determine the most constrained device, they have to then do allocation
     with the matching API for that device.
<p>
<li> The IOMMU and DMA API interfaces  do not currently allow for the DMA
     optimizations used in ION.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Possible solutions</h4>
<p>
Previously, when ION has been discussed in the community, there have
been a few potential approaches proposed. Here are the
ones I'm aware of.
<p>
One idea would be to try to just merge a centralized ION-like allocator
upstream, keeping a similar interface. To address the problematic
constraint discoverability issue, devices would export a opaque heap
cookie via sysfs and/or via an <tt>ioctl()</tt>, depending on the device's needs
(devices could have different requirements depending on device-specific
configuration). The meaning of the bits would not be defined to
user space, but could be ANDed together by a user-space application and passed to the
allocator, much as the heap mask is currently with ION. This provides a
way for user space to do the constraint solving but avoids the problem of
fixing heap types into the ABI; it also allows the kernel to define which
bits mean which heap for a given machine, making the interface
more flexible and extensible. This, however, is a more complicated
interface for user space to use, and many do not like the idea of exposing
the constraint information to user space, even in the form of an opaque cookie.
<p>
Another possible solution 
is to allow dma-buf exporters to not allocate the backing buffers
immediately. This would allow multiple drivers to attach to a dma-buf
before the allocation occurs. Then, when the buffer is first used,
the allocation is done; at that time, the allocator could scan the list of
attached drivers and be able to determine the constraints of the
attached devices and allocate memory accordingly. This would allow
user space to not have to deal with any constraint solving. 
<p>
While this
approach was planned for when dma-bufs were originally designed, much
needed infrastructure is still missing and no drivers yet use this
solution. The Android developers have raised the concern that this sort
of delayed allocation could cause non-deterministic latency in
application hot-paths, though, without an implementation, this has not
yet been quantified. Another downside is that this delayed
allocation isn't required of all dma-buf exporters, so it would only
work with drivers that actually implement this feature.
Since the possibility exists that not all of the drivers one would want to 
share a buffer with would support delayed allocation, applications would have to
somehow detect the functionality and make sure to allocate memory to be
shared using the dma-buf exporter that does support this delayed
allocation functionality. This approach also requires the exporter driver
allocators to each handle this constraint solving individually (though
common helper functions may be something that could be provided).
<p>
Another possible approach could be to prototype the dma-buf late-allocation
constraint solving using a generic dma-buf exporter. This in 
some ways would be ION-like in that it would be a centralized exporter,
but would not expose heap IDs to user space. Then the buffer would be
attached to the various hardware drivers, and, on the first use, the
exporter would determine the attached constraints and allocate the
buffer. This would provide a testing ground for the delayed-allocation
approach above while having some conceptual parallels to ION. The
downside to this approach would be that the centralized interface would
likely not be able to address the more intricate hardware-specific
allocation flags that possibly could be needed.
<p>
Finally, none of these proposals address the non-generic caching
optimizations ION uses, so those issues will have to be discussed further.
<p>
<h4>Conference Discussion</h4>
<p>
I suspect at the Linux Plumbers Android + Graphics mini-conference, we
won't find a magic or easy solution on how to get Android's ION
functionality upstream. But I hope that, by having key developers from
both the Android team and the upstream kernel community able to discuss
their needs and constraints and be able to listen to each other, we
might be able to get a sense of which subproblems have to be addressed
and what direction forward we might be able to take. To this end I've
created a few questions for folks to think about and discuss so we can
hopefully come up with answers for during the discussion:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Current upstream dma-buf sharing uses, such as PRIME, seem focused on
x86 use cases (such as two devices sharing buffers). Will these interfaces
really scale to ARM-style uses cases (many devices sharing buffers) in a
generic fashion? As non-centralized allocation requires exporters to
manage more logic and understand device constraints, and there seems to
be a potential that this approach will eventually be unmaintainable.
<p>
<li> ION's centralized allocation style is problematic in many cases, but
also provides significant performance gains. Is this too major of an
impasse or is there a way forward?
<p>
<li> What other potential solutions haven't yet been considered?
<p>
<li> If a centralized dma-buf allocation API is the way forward, what would
be the best approach (ie: heap-cookies, vs post-attach allocation)?
<p>
<li> Is there any way to implement some of the caching optimizations ION
uses in a way that is also more generically applicable? Possibly extending
IOMMU/DMA-API?
<p>
<li> Given Android's needs, what next steps could be done to converge on a
solution? How can we test to see if attach-time solving will be usable
for Android developers? What would it miss that ION still provides?
<p>
<li> How do Android developers plan to deal with IOMMUs and non-32-bit ARM
architecture issues?
</ul>

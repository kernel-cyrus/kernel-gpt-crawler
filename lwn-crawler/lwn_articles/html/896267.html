           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 26, 2022</br>
           </div>
The normal rule of kernel development is that the creation of user-space
regressions is not allowed; a patch that breaks a previously working
application must be either fixed or reverted.  There are exceptions,
though, including <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/36e2c7421f02">a
5.10 patch</a> that has been turning up regressions ever since.  The story
that emerges here shows what can happen when the goals of stability,
avoiding security problems, and code cleanup run into conflict.
<p>
The <tt>set_fs()</tt> function was added to the kernel early in its
history; it was not in the initial 0.01 release, but was added before the
0.10 release in late 1991.
Normally, kernel code that is intended to access user-space memory will
generate an error if it attempts to access kernel space instead; this
restriction prevents, for example, attempts by an attacker to access kernel
memory via system calls.  A call to
<tt>set_fs(KERNEL_DS)</tt> can be used to lift the restriction when the 
need arises; a common use case for <tt>set_fs()</tt> is to be able to
perform file I/O from within the kernel.  Calling <tt>set_fs(USER_DS)</tt>
puts the restriction back.
<p>
The problem with <tt>set_fs()</tt> is that it turns out to be easy to
forget the second <tt>set_fs()</tt> call to restore the protection of
kernel space, leading directly to the "total compromise" scenario that
kernel developers will normally take some pains to avoid.  Numerous such
bugs have been fixed over the years, but it had long been clear that the
real solution was to just get rid of <tt>set_fs()</tt> entirely and adopt
safer ways of accessing kernel memory when needed.
<p>
Developers (and Christoph Hellwig in particular) got more serious about
this objective in 2020 and <a href="/Articles/832121/">made a determined
push</a> to eliminate <tt>set_fs()</tt> entirely.  Much of this work went
into 5.10, though the final bits of the <tt>set_fs()</tt> infrastructure
were only removed in 5.18.  Back in 2020, though, one question that
provoked some discussion was what should be done about <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html"><tt>splice()</tt></a>.
<p>
The <tt>splice()</tt> system call will connect an open file descriptor to a
pipe, then move data between the two for as long as the data stream lasts.
This movement happens entirely within the kernel, potentially eliminating
the need for large numbers of system calls; in some settings, it can
provide a significant performance improvement.  By its nature,
<tt>splice()</tt> often has to move data to and from buffers that are in
kernel space; to make that possible, it used <tt>set_fs()</tt>.
<p>
Hellwig duly came up with a new implementation that would keep
<tt>splice()</tt> working in the absence of <tt>set_fs()</tt>, but Linus
Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wit9enePELG=-HnLsr0nY5bucFNjqAqWoFTuYDGR1P4KA@mail.gmail.com/">rejected
it</a>, saying that he didn't like the "<q>complexity and
messiness</q>" of the implementation.  But he also made it clear that he
didn't feel the need to guarantee that <tt>splice()</tt> would keep working
at all; he felt that making <tt>splice()</tt> work by default on most file
types led to a number of security issues.  Later in 2020, for example, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-%3DwiXQVE_jGN0ajk%2BKm925WSbCL16mAZ-UXNkp%2Bnkc1nuQw%40mail.gmail.com/">said</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I'd rather limit splice (and kernel_read too, for that matter) as
	much as possible. It was a mistake originally to allow it
	everywhere, and it's come back to bite us.
<p>
	So I'd rather have people notice these odd corner cases and get
	them fixed one by one than just say "anything goes".
</blockquote>
<p>
So the patches that went into 5.10 ended up breaking <tt>splice()</tt> for
any file 
type that did not have explicit support for the new way of doing things;
the idea was that the important cases would be noticed and fixed over time.
That has indeed happened; if one looks for patches committed as explicit
fixes to the disabling of <tt>splice()</tt> support, one finds fixes for
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/06a17bbe1d47">the AFS filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cf03f316ad20">the 9p filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c1048828c3db">the orangefs filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/14e3e989f6a5"><tt>/proc/mountinfo</tt></a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/dd78b0c483e3">the TTY subsystem</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f2d6c2708bd8">kernfs</a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f8ad8187c3b5"><tt>sendfile()</tt></a>,
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a35d8f016e0b">the nilfs2
filesystem</a>, and
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/42984af09afc">the JFFS2 filesystem</a>.
<p>
Most recently, Jens Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220519193133.194138-1-axboe@kernel.dk/">reported</a>
that <tt>splice()</tt> no longer worked on <tt>/dev/random</tt> or
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>; he 
included a patch to fix the problem as well.  These patches were later <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220520094459.116240-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/">reworked</a>
by random-number-generator maintainer Jason Donenfeld and were applied to
the mainline during the 5.19 merge window.

Along the way, Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Yoey+FOYO69lS5qP@zx2c4.com/">observed</a> that the
necessary changes resulted in a performance regression of about 3% when
reading from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.  That led him to ask whether the fix
was something that was needed at all; after some discussion, Axboe <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/72344aad-b5ad-b317-d36d-385cb16d5204@kernel.dk/">gave
him the lecture</a> on regressions:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 If you have an application that is written using eg splice from
	 /dev/urandom, then it should indeed be safe to expect that it will
	 indeed continue working. If we have one core tenet in the kernel
	 it's that you should ALWAYS be able to upgrade your kernel and not
	 have any breakage in terms of userspace ABI. Obviously that can
	 happen sometimes, but I think this one is exactly the poster child
	 of breakage that should NOT happen. We took away a feature that
	 someone depended on.
</blockquote>
<p>
That is the sort of breakage that did indeed happen but, in this case, a
change was made knowing that this kind of problem would result.  Hellwig
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220520060244.GA16503@lst.de/">said</a> in
response to Axboe's patch set that "<q>compared to my initial fears the
fallout actually isn't 
that bad</q>", but a perusal of the above list of fixes might lead one
to a different conclusion.
<p>
The removal of <tt>set_fs()</tt> is, in many ways, a model for what the
kernel development process can do.  A fundamental piece of low-level
structure that had been deeply wired into the kernel since the beginning
was replaced with a much safer alternative without breaking the project's
pace of a stable release every nine or ten weeks.  The steady stream of
regressions resulting from this change, though, is not what the project
sets out to do — and it seems 
certain that this particular gift has not yet stopped giving.
<p>
The decision to take this path was driven by a fear of security problems,
based on the past history of the <tt>splice()</tt> system call.  If those
fears are still justified (and they might well be; consider, for example,
that <tt>splice()</tt> 
was a part of the <a href="https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/">"Dirty Pipe"
vulnerability</a> reported earlier this year), then refusing to make all
existing <tt>splice()</tt> implementations just work without
<tt>set_fs()</tt> may have prevented far worse regressions than the ones we
have seen.  Having to fix a filesystem is annoying; having to endure yet
another security drill for a branded vulnerability with a silly
name is rather more so.
<p>
There is no way of knowing whether that is how things would have gone in
this case.  But it is
true that this type of episode makes the kernel's "no regressions" rule
look a bit more like just a guideline.  It does not take too many of those
to create breakage to the project's reputation that is hard to splice back together.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The ensuing performance discussion is somewhat interesting. Currently it&#x27;s taking place across a few threads. My tracking of it is:<br>
<p>
<p>
- I noticed the slow down here:<br>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yoey+FOYO69lS5qP@zx2c4.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yoey+FOYO69lS5qP@zx2c4.com/</a><br>
- Jens confirmed it&#x27;s around 3%:<br>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/0a6ed6b9-0917-0d83-5c45-70ff58fad429@kernel.dk/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/0a6ed6b9-0917-0d83-5c45-70ff...</a><br>
- Relatedly, I had proposed doing the same thing to /dev/zero: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220520135030.166831-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220520135030.166831-1-Jaso...</a><br>
- Jens liked the idea, but Al pointed out the<br>
performance issues, and later started figuring out why:<br>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yokmu7bQpg70Bp8R@zeniv-ca.linux.org.uk/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yokmu7bQpg70Bp8R@zeniv-ca.li...</a><br>
- Al references resurrecting a particularly relevent older thread on<br>
fsdevel:<br>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/Yokl+uHTVWFxoQGn@zeniv-ca.linux.org.uk/">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/Yokl+uHTVWFxoQGn@ze...</a><br>
- This thread is now a many messages deep. That&#x27;s where things are at now.<br>
- Looks like Al&#x27;s got some patches he&#x27;s playing with in<br>
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/log/?h=new.iov_iter">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs....</a><br>

Hopefully those close the performance gap and then all drivers get faster.<br>

splice has to keep working; does it have to keep working *fast*? Could it become a wrapper around sendfile-like semantics, and then just have specific cases where it can go faster?<br>

I think that depends on the use case. When fd_in is a pipe, splice should be quite fast, because the man page says it just copies pointers to individual pages. If you use a naive sendfile-like implementation, suddenly you&#x27;re making real copies. Or at least, that&#x27;s what I was able to figure out from the man pages, anyway.<br>
<p>
Side note: Why are there so many syscalls that do almost, but not quite, entirely the same thing in this space? We&#x27;ve also got copy_file_range(2), which seems to be the same as splice(2) but both fds must be normal files. And then there&#x27;s vmsplice(2), which appears to be exactly the same as read(2)/write(2), but with an overly-complicated API, unless you pass SPLICE_F_GIFT, which looks to be the &quot;I&#x27;m doing something ridiculous, don&#x27;t judge me&quot; flag. And I imagine there&#x27;s also some io_uring equivalent to this madness, too. Why is there not a simple, all-purpose &quot;move data from here to here and don&#x27;t bother me about the details, just do whatever&#x27;s fastest or most reasonable&quot; syscall?<br>
<p>
* splice isn&#x27;t it, because splice requires one of the fds to be a pipe.<br>
* copy_file_range isn&#x27;t it, because it requires *both* of the fds to be normal files.<br>
* sendfile isn&#x27;t it, because it&#x27;s missing an offset argument for the output file, and the input file must not be a socket.<br>
* io_uring isn&#x27;t it, because it&#x27;s like five syscalls and a userspace buffer, not one fire-and-forget syscall.<br>

vmsplice() is for sending the same data multiple times, I believe? E.g., pre-canned HTTP headers or small responses. vmsplice() once to get it from userspace into the kernel, then you can splice multiple times with copy.<br>

That still doesn&#x27;t explain why you need the silly GIFT flag. Why can&#x27;t the kernel just mark the offending pages as COW, like fork(2) does? You could do that without a special flag, because it should be transparent to userspace. Indeed, you can do that even for write(2), if you really want to.<br>

I believe the gift flag is seen as a mistake in retrospect.<br>
<p>
FreeBSD has CoW on send(), I believe, but of course that means you need to go through a rather expensive page fault when/if the data changes.<br>

      <p>This was exactly Linus' original reasoning wrt vmsplice:</p>

NO!

That's a huge mistake, and anybody that does it that way (FreeBSD) is totally incompetent.

That cost is _bigger_ than the cost of just copying the page in the first place.

<p>See also <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/19/237">Linus' justifications of splice and tee</a> earlier in that thread. vmsplice is also briefly mentioned, and it's implicit from the context that much of the net value of vmsplice comes from combining with tee, as you mentioned earlier.</p>

&quot;But it is true that this type of episode makes the kernel&#x27;s &quot;no regressions&quot; rule look a bit more like just a guideline.&quot;<br>
<p>
A bit like the Constitution for the UKoGBnNI - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_...</a> - &quot;Unlike in most countries, no attempt has been made to codify such arrangements into a single document.&quot; <br>
<p>
... and yet somehow we struggle along. <br>
<p>
It might look a bit daft to conflate the Linux kernel&#x27;s governance with the UK&#x27;s legal system but I think it is quite instructional.  One of our cherished principles is the idea that you should be able to &quot;quietly enjoy&quot; your property - I can&#x27;t remember the exact term.  I think a coal mine making a racket caused the formative judgment.<br>
<p>
So, the no regressions thing can be seen in similar terms:  Don&#x27;t break people&#x27;s code.<br>
<p>
However we have to be practical and sometimes stuff has to change.<br>

Is this something that is a problem only because RAII is not used (and couldn&#x27;t you _really_ get something like that working for the kernel), or do I misunderstand the original problem?<br>
<p>
It seems like a silly limitation to me; as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s 100% knowable at the time of the initial set_fs() call that you want to reset it exactly when the current function (or block) exits. It&#x27;s not even something that would require producing code that is slower than the correct C code.<br>

That&#x27;s not the problem.<br>
<p>
The problem is twofold. One is that while set_fs() is active, various security measures (like SMEP and SMAP) are defeated. The other is that (on some architectures and eg on a 4GB/4GB split x86-32), you may not actually be able to access userspace because accessing userspace actually accesses kernel space. On x86-64, you can tell from the high bits of the pointer whether it&#x27;s userspace or kernel space, but that&#x27;s not true eg on SPARC or PARISC.<br>

Are you sure?<br>
afaik, set_fs() has nothing to do with SM*P, it was abused wrt access_ok() - copy_*_user().<br>

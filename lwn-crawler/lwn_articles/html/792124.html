The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
system call allows user space to load a BPF program into the kernel for
execution, manipulate BPF maps, and carry out a number of other BPF-related
functions.  BPF programs are verified and sandboxed, but they are still 
running in a privileged context and, depending on the type of program
loaded, are capable of creating various types of mayhem.  As a result, most
BPF operations, including the
loading of almost all types of BPF program, are restricted to processes with
the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability — those running as root, as a general
rule.  BPF programs are useful in many contexts, though, so there has long been
interest in making access to <tt>bpf()</tt> more 
widely available.  One step in that direction has been <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190625182303.874270-1-songliubraving@fb.com/">posted</a>
by Song Liu; it works by adding a novel security-policy mechanism to the
kernel.
<p>
This approach is easy enough to describe.  A new special device,
<tt>/dev/bpf</tt> is added, with the core idea that any process that has
the permission to open this file will be allowed "<q>to access most of
sys_bpf() features</q>" — though what comprises "most" is never really
spelled out.  A non-root process that wants to perform a BPF operation,
such as creating a map or loading a program, will start by opening this
file.  It then must perform an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call
(<tt>BPF_DEV_IOCTL_GET_PERM</tt>) to actually enable its ability to call
<tt>bpf()</tt>.  That ability can be turned off again with the
<tt>BPF_DEV_IOCTL_PUT_PERM</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command.
<p>
Internally to the kernel, this mechanism works by adding a new field
(<tt>bpf_flags</tt>) to the <tt>task_struct</tt> structure.  When BPF
access is enabled, a bit is set in that field.  If this patch goes forward,
that detail is likely to change since, as Daniel Borkmann <a
href="/ml/netdev/9bc166ca-1ef0-ee1e-6306-6850d4008174@iogearbox.net/">pointed
out</a>, adding an <tt>unsigned long</tt> to that structure for a single
bit of information is unlikely to be popular; some other location for that
bit will be found.
<p>
The next step is the addition of little function to determine whether the
current process is capable of performing BPF operations:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline bool bpf_capable(int cap)
    {
	return test_bit(TASK_BPF_FLAG_PERMITTED, &amp;current-&gt;bpf_flags) ||
	    capable(cap);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Calls to <tt>bpf_capable()</tt> then replace the various
<tt>capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</tt> (or sometimes <tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt>) calls
that currently protect access to BPF functionality.  While the cover letter
says that access is provided to "most of" the available BPF
features, the patch appears to change every <tt>capable()</tt> call in the
<tt>kernel/bpf</tt> directory.
<p>
The end result of all this work is that a system administrator could, for
example, create a new group called <tt>bpf</tt>; that group would be the
group owner of the <tt>/dev/bpf</tt> file.  The permissions on
<tt>/dev/bpf</tt> would be set to allow group read access (write access is
not required to make the <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls); thereafter, any process
with membership in the <tt>bpf</tt> group would be able to use the
<tt>bpf()</tt> system call.
<p>
It's worth noting that most interesting things that can be done with BPF
involve subsystems beyond the BPF virtual machine itself.  Attaching a BPF
program to a tracepoint requires the cooperation of the tracing code, for
example, and using BPF programs in networking necessarily involves the
networking subsystem.  There are usually permission checks in those
subsystems as well; tracepoint access requires the ability to call <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html"><tt>perf_event_open()</tt></a>,
for example, which may be restricted depending on the system's
configuration.  This patch does not change those checks, with one
exception: the restrictions on what can be done with BPF socket-filter
programs are removed if the BPF capability has been turned on.
<p>
In summary, what this patch is doing is creating a new capability bit that
exists outside of the normal Linux capability mechanism, and which can be
turned on or off by any process with read access to <tt>/dev/bpf</tt>.
This new capability is recognized within the BPF subsystem, and in one
place in the networking code; it seems highly likely that its use could
expand to other parts of the kernel as well.  This is a bit of a twist on
the usual kernel security model.
<p>
There are reasons why one might not want to just add another capability bit
instead
(<tt>CAP_SYS_BPF</tt>, say).  Existing capability-aware programs would not
know what the new bit means and may well mishandle it, for example.  But it is
not clear that creating what is essentially a capability bit in a separate
guise improves on that situation.
<p>
It seems likely that, at some point, somebody will want to be able to
enable BPF functionality with finer-grained control.  The good news is that
the low-level machinery to do that is already there in the form of a set of
Linux security module (LSM) hooks.  Given the increasing use of LSMs to
give administrators control over security policies in the kernel, it's
perhaps surprising that an LSM-based approach was apparently not considered
for this case.  That could perhaps change as this patch set moves beyond
the BPF community and is reviewed more widely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What happens if two threads of a process both do `GET_PERMS` and have their `PUT_PERMS` interleaved? Is the bit per-open("/dev/bpf")? Does the second GET fail? Or does the thread doing BPF work after the other thread does its PUT end up out-of-luck?<br>

And is the BPF permission state inherited across fork? Do sandboxes all need to explicitly disable that state now? How does this state interact with setuid?<br>
<p>
Frankly, adding a new kind of per-process or per-task state for this seems like a really bad idea when there are existing models that could work. If new CAP_SYS capabilities are deprecated (which seems like something that should perhaps be addressed directly), create a new bpf() syscall (or ioctl) that requires an open /dev/bpf fd as an argument. That would answer all the above questions, existing code would be secure, and reified capabilities are just better than ambient state.<br>

<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In that case this is going to be very hard if not impossible to use from languages that don't allow controlling threads, aka Go. I'm sure there are other examples as well.</font><br>
<p>
So Go is creating pressure for the kernel to make state per-process instead of per-thread. That is a very significant divergence from the "everything is a task" ethos that guided Linux for a long time and which encouraged making state per-thread.<br>
<p>
But making state per-process was, and still is, quite dangerous, for the obvious reason that one thread can then unpredictably affect the operation of other threads. Not a big problem for small monolithic applications entirely managed by a small team, but a significant problem for large complex applications importing code from many teams. Even for sufficiently large Go projects this would be a problem, in which case the only safe way to use the per-process API would be to use it during startup while there is only one thread. And if you do that, you might as well have made the state per-thread and inheritable. And if you do that, then platforms that let you use OS threads directly can use the feature safely in multithreaded code. So why not make it per-thread?<br>

Indeed. If the descriptor is a capability, it seems that it should be used as such.<br>
<p>
Also, some of those capable() calls control the ability to convert pointers to integers. Those should not be changed.<br>

I like the approach you proposed in Portland; any plans to pursue that for this case?<br>

I emailed about that on the patch thread.<br>
<p>
I think it’s the wrong approach here. People are obviously willing to slightly modify their program for this new unprivileged mode — the ioctl requires it.  Given that, I think the right solution is to be fully explicit: just pass the fd into the bpf() syscall.<br>

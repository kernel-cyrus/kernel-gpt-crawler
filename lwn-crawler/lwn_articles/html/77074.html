<h1>The return of write barriers</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
One of the tasks on the 2.5 "to do" list was the implementation of proper
write barriers in the block I/O subsystem.  Any code which attempts to
implement true transactional behavior on disk-based files needs this
capability.  Without it, systems like journaling filesystems and database
managers lack the control they need over the order in which data is written
to disk.  Mis-ordered writes can lead to data corruption and other
unfortunate things.
<p>
The 2.6 block I/O subsystem was designed with barrier support as a core
feature.  But, at this point, most low-level block drivers do not actually
implement barriers, and the filesystems do not use them.  Patches to fill
in some of the gaps have been around for a while (LWN looked at barriers <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/54070/">last October</a>), but have not yet
been merged.
<p>
There has been a new surge of interest in proper barrier support, perhaps
as a result of applications vendors starting to take a hard look at the 2.6
kernel.  Now Jens Axboe and Chris Mason have put together <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/76540/">a new barrier support patch</a> which
gets Linux closer to being able to provide real disk I/O guarantees.  With
this patch, write barriers work, but only on IDE drives (not SCSI or serial
ATA), and only with the reiserfs and ext3 filesystems.  Even then, things
are qualified: "<q>ext3 works but only if things don't go wrong.</q>"
<p>
In other words, barrier support will be staying on the "to do" list for a
little while longer yet.  But the work is being done, and 2.6 should be
able to implement real barriers before it is all over.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      As a user whose entire system is reiserfs based, I've been watching current 2.6 kernel <br>delopments with interest.  Until 2.6.5 rcs, most of the journalling fixes seemed to be ext3 <br>only.  Now, reiserfs seems to be getting some attention as well.  It DOES seem to be <br>paying off, as current 2.6.5-rc2 seems more stable, at least here on my dual Opteron, <br>than anything to this point has been, either 2.4 or 2.6 kernel based (well, minus the last <br>couple 2.4s, as I've switched to 2.6 entirely, now). <br> <br>Duncan <br>

      The ReiserFS instabilities only apply to AMD64, I believe.  If you are running x86,  <br>you should be OK.  I'm not sure about other 64-bit archs.  <br>  <br>AMD64, and I suppose now i86e (Intel's version), are still bleeding edge in a  <br>number of areas, most of them due to &quot;borrowed&quot; x86 code that isn't 64-bit clean --  <br>assumptions about the size of memory pointers being the same as standard 32-bit  <br>integers, etc.  Thus, to some extent, anybody on the platform should be used to  <br>working around various issues already.  As well, kernel 2.4 is semi-depreciated for  <br>AMD64, so those on the platform should really be switching to 2.6 anyway, as  <br>that's where any real work on the platform is taking place.  <br>  <br>Another factor is that of devfs, if you use that.  2.4 devfs support for AMD64 is, I  <br>am told, entirely blacklisted, now, and not even an an option, on newer 2.4 kernels.   <br>The status of devfs in 2.6 is officially depreciated overall, but Andrew Morton has  <br>said it will continue to be supported thru 2.6, anyway, so official withdrawal isn't  <br>going to be until 2.7 devel kernel at least.  Still, despite the fact that it's a  <br>Mandrake (and Gentoo) default, I'm not using devfs any more here (on Mandrake,  <br>and hopefully gentoo, soon), entirely 2.6 kernels tho I may be running at this point.   <br>For now, I'm running a static /dev, but  Gentoo udev is said to be ready to mount  <br>over /dev now (unless you have devices not yet ported to sysfs, and then there are  <br>workarounds), and Mdk will likely go that route at some point, particularly as they  <br>have an AMD64 port to worry about as well, altho they will I expect stick to devfs  <br>for some time and backport patches as required to the 2.4.23 or whatever last 2.4  <br>kernel that had it for AMD64, so folks can continue to choose 2.4 or 2.6 kernels and  <br>still continue to use supermount and the traditional Mdk devfs based distrib.  <br>  <br>The most tracable problem re 2.6 and ReiserFS (again, on AMD64) has been  <br>repeatable kernel lockups when copying a file from a ReiserFS partition to an  <br>Ext2/3 partition, according to the notes at amd64.gentoo.org.  Apparently, it's fairly  <br>common for Gentoo users to install Reiserfs on most of their system but put ext2  <br>on /boot, which isn't mounted by default, on gentoo, and I suppose their thinking is  <br>doesn't need the journalling.  They recommend using the -notail option when  <br>mounting a reiserfs /boot, tho I don't know why, unless grub, their boot manager of  <br>choice requires it.  That hasn't been required by LILO for a good two years at  <br>least, now, and notail of course negates one of the biggest advantages of reiserfs,  <br>efficient storage of small files.  <br>  <br>Anyway, my system is 100% reiserfs, so that shouldn't bother me, but I *HAVE*  <br>had instability issues.  Part of that I think is alsa driver related, for the on-board  <br>AMD8111 (using i810 alsa driver) sound.  Again, apparently some of it hasn't been  <br>64-bit clean.. either that or there are SMP issues or it's a combination of both.   <br>However, while that accounts for over 50% of my problem, the system has  <br>occasionally frozen for no apparent reason when sound was NOT involved  <br>(without X running therefore no environmental sound effects to trigger it, and with  <br>no sound playing at the console).  I had until recently attributed it to other apps  <br>and general 64-bit unclean code traces still around, or to SMP, but after I began  <br>seeing the reiserfs connected stuff, I began to suspect that whatever the problem  <br>is/was, copying from reiserfs to ext2/3 is only the most repeatable trigger for a bug  <br>in reiserfs that other things occasionally ALSO trigger (again, at least on this SMP  <br>AMD64 system).  <br>  <br>I do know that the latest 2.6.5-rc2 (and rc1, which I missed) kernel has changelog  <br>entries for BOTH the i810 alsa drivers AND reiserfs, and that my system has  <br>seemed MUCH more stable since I installed it.  However, part of that may be due  <br>to upgrading some other Mandrake packages, including XMMS, from  <br>AMD64-Cooker (which I keep updated to), and the fact that the XMMS MP3 plugin  <br>isn't working at all right now due again to 32/64-bit issues, meaning I haven't been  <br>hitting the MP3s as hard as I normally do.  I still have to get that resolved..  <br>  <br>Still, the kernel DOES seem SOMEWHAT more stable, in any case, since I've been  <br>trying to bootstrap gentoo (probably the reason I haven't gotten the Mdk XMMS  <br>thing worked around) and where I was once having kernel lockups (with 2.6.4,  <br>again, on 100% ReiserFS, on SMP AMD64) half-way thru, now I'm getting simple  <br>process segfaults that don't kill the kernel.  The last couple of times I've tried it has  <br>segfaulted in exactly the same spot, and I think it is due to one of the earlier  <br>crashes leaving a garbage file.  (You probably know by now what the difference  <br>between metadata and data journalling is, and that reiserfs journals metadata, not  <br>data, guaranteeing a consistent file system, but not necessarily that files open at  <br>the time of a crash will not contain garbage data..  To guarantee the data file itself,  <br>you need ext3 set to data journalling, slow but as close to 100% reliable as it gets,  <br>and even then, there are times it may not be 100%, due to actual drive hardware  <br>caching and the like.)  Thus, next I am planning to wipe the partitions I was  <br>installing to and start over.  However, the point is that I'm no longer getting the  <br>kernel lockups that were preventing the bootstrap compile b4, so the system is  <br>obviously more stable with 2.6.5-rc2 than it was with 2.6.4.  <br>  <br>Anyway, 2.6 on x86 should be comparatively stable, reiserfs or not.  It's x86_64  <br>that's not, but that's true for the platform in entirety, not just the kernel on it.  <br>  <br>..  <br>  <br>As for the other exchange on mono, yes, I did, but I didn't really have a lot more to  <br>go on than gut feelings re MS, it's source.  Having expressed those, and seeing I  <br>was obviously talking to someone who knew more about the subject than I did, but  <br>it didn't change my gut feeling and there are other alternatives, I had little more to  <br>say..  However, I still remain interested, and events and other stuff I have read of  <br>late has me a bit more optimistic than I was, tho *I* still wouldn't be putting *MY*  <br>eggs in that basket, but I'm not quite so worried about others doing so, if they <br>judge the risk worth it for them.  Like I said, tho, I'm still interested, and sending <br>you a private e-mail..  <br>  <br>I am a bit surprised.. and encouraged, I guess, that you aren't all SuSE and Red <br>Carpet, now, but are still doing Gentoo and Fedora..  That's a good sign regarding <br>Novell and recent developments (having just read the Groklaw writeup on <br>Brainshare today.. that LWN pointed at).

      I'm glad to say my experience with ReiserFS on x86-64 has been flawless so far and I hope that I don't encounter any of the problems you're having. &nbsp;I've run a series of 2.6 kernels with experimental libata versions patched in to support a Silicon Image 3114 SATA RAID contoller, a setup that should have been bleeding edge that's instead been rock stable for me for months. &nbsp;The SiL3114 has only been in use for part of that time, but no problems there either. &nbsp;I'm running SuSE 9.0 for x86-64 and now that they've released a patch CD with kernels supporting my controller I'm running their 2.4 series. &nbsp;Two caveats are that my system rarely runs under heavy load for long sustained periods (though "make -j" on a kernel compile was fun), ALSA is running but unused and I did see what appeared to be a very slow kernel memory leak (yikes) with 2.6 and the very first libata + experimentall SiL3114 support patch combination. &nbsp;Nothing since though and never a hang or crash.

      Are you running SMP?  I think it might be SMP related as well, and I'm almost <br>sure PART of the problem was i810 ALSA support, when actively playing. <br> <br>I DO know 2.6.5-rc2 has been FAR more stable, tho not perfect.  I've been <br>attempting to install Gentoo from a stage-1 compile and not having much luck, but <br>I'm finally getting somewhere now that I have 2.6.5-rc2 installed.  As I mentioned, <br>it seems to kernel-freeze MUCH less, now, than with 2.6.4 and earlier (incl. the 2.4 <br>kernels I was on originally).   (The problem with the Gentoo install now is that I'm <br>trying to do it a bit more customized than their handbook has instructions for.  &lt;g&gt;  <br>However, I'm progressing, and I was compiling kernels back b4 I'd fully switched <br>from MSWormOS, while I was still booting back to it to do mail as I hadn't even <br>gotten a Linux mail client set up yet.. So, yes, I'm accustomed to doing it the hard <br>way right off -- but ending up knowing FAR more about the system for it.  &lt;g&gt;  <br>Anyway, I just found a combination of kernel-sources, glibc, kernel-headers, and <br>nptl, that seem to work, and am rebuilding glibc as I write..  The nptl is the not <br>directly documented in the manual part of THIS bootstrap... &lt;g&gt;) <br> <br>Duncan

<a href="https://lwn.net/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2016-Embedded_Linux_Conference">ELC</a>
</div>
<p>At the
2016 <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference">Embedded
Linux Conference</a> in San Diego, Arnd Bergmann presented a <a href="http://openiotelc2016.sched.org/event/6DAc">session</a>
on what he called a "lighter topic," his recent efforts to catch and
fix kernel bugs through static tests.  Primarily, his method involved
automating a large number of builds, first to catch compilation errors
that caused build failures, then to catch compiler warning
messages. He has done these builds for years, progressively fixing the
errors and then the
warnings for a range of kernel configurations.

<p>There are two motives for this particular side project, he said: to
help automate the testing of the many pull requests seen in the
arm-soc tree (for which the sheer number of SoCs presents a logistical
challenge), and to put significant code-refactoring work to the test.
Previously, he explained, he had attempted to review every pull
request in arm-soc and fix every regression, but that quickly proved too
time-consuming to be done manually.  Testing each patch automatically
first reduced the time required.  As
for refactoring, he noted that he was a veteran of the big kernel lock
removal days and was now helping out with the effort to implement
year-2038 compliance.  In both cases, the refactoring touched hundreds
of separate drivers, which can mean a glut of regressions.

<p>Broadly speaking, he said, there are two approaches to testing
scores of builds.  One can either record all known warnings and send
an email whenever a new warning appears, or one can try to eliminate
all known warnings.  Bergmann has opted for the second approach,
running a near-constant stream of kernel builds, and creating a
patch for every compiler warning he sees.  At present, he reported,
there are about 500 such patches, most of them tiny.  He is currently
automating builds with a script he wrote that creates a random kernel
configuration and attempts a build.  He is averaging 50 builds a day,
almost all for 32-bit ARM, with occasional forays into 64-bit ARM and,
rarely, other architectures.

<p>Getting to this current state has taken some time.  In
2011, he began by fixing all of the failures produced by running <tt>make&nbsp;defconfig</tt> (that is, "default
configuration") and <tt>make&nbsp;allmodconfig</tt> (that is, configuring as many symbols
to "module" as possible) builds in the arm-soc tree.  By 2012, those
failures were eliminated, so he set out to eliminate all compiler
warnings

produced by <tt>defconfig</tt> builds.  By 2013, those warnings had been
eliminated, and he began running his build tests with
<tt>make&nbsp;randconfig</tt>&mdash;which creates a randomized kernel
configuration.  In 2013, he had eliminated all <tt>randconfig</tt>
failures, and turned to eliminating the <tt>allmodconfig</tt>
warnings.  He began chipping away at <tt>randconfig</tt> warnings in
mid-2014.  Although that process is not yet complete, he has also
begun to run build tests using the Clang compiler instead of GCC,
which, as one would expect, generates entirely different errors and
warnings.

<p>The most common bugs he discovers with <tt>randconfig</tt> builds
are missing dependency statements, he said, which cause necessary parts of
the kernel to not get built.  In particular, he cited 
missing Netfilter dependencies and ALSA codec dependencies as common, although he
also noted that x86 developers seem to forget that, at least on ARM,
I2C can be configured as a module and thus needs to be listed as a
dependency if it is needed.  The ALSA problems suggest that we
need a better way to express codec dependencies, he said, although
he conceded that kernel configurations are confusing in plenty of
ways.  For example, he showed this patch he had written:

<pre>
    --- a/net/openvswitch/Kconfig
    +++ b/net/openvswitch/Kconfig
    @@ -7,7 +7,9 @@ config OPENVSWITCH
      depends on INET
      depends on !NF_CONNTRACK || \
           (NF_CONNTRACK &amp;&amp; ((!NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 || NF_DEFRAG_IPV6) &amp;&amp; \
    -               (!NF_NAT || NF_NAT)))
    +               (!NF_NAT || NF_NAT) &amp;&amp; \
    +               (!NF_NAT_IPV4 || NF_NAT_IPV4) &amp;&amp; \
    +               (!NF_NAT_IPV6 || NF_NAT_IPV6)))
      select LIBCRC32C
      select MPLS
      select NET_MPLS_GSO
</pre>

<p>and asked "what does it even mean for it to depend on
<tt>NF_NAT</tt> or <em>not</em> <tt>NF_NAT</tt>?"  The answer, he
said, is that the test is being used to set an "is it a module or not"
dependency for later usage, but it is hardly surprising that such
syntax leads to bugs.

<p>After "modules, modules, and more modules," Bergmann said, the next
most common class of bugs he catches is uninitialized variables.  He
noted that Rusty Russell has <a
href="http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=232">written</a> about how
uninitialized variables are useful for error catching, but argued that
they cause plenty of other errors.  He showed a few examples, noting
that often the flow of the code may mean that a reference to an
uninitialized variable can never be reached, but he writes patches
anyway to eliminate the warning.  He also pointed out Steven Rostedt's <a
href="/Articles/308586/">patch to override <tt>if</tt></a> (for
tracing purposes), saying it totally confused GCC, but that it helps
to uncover quite a few bugs.

<p>Next, Bergmann discussed some of the other code-checking tools
available for kernel development, like <tt>scripts/checkpatch.pl</tt>
and <a href="http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/chrisl/sparse.git">Sparse</a>.  Checkpatch looks for basic coding-style issues, he said,
so while it is beneficial for submitting patches, it is not
particularly valuable to run against existing code.

<p>Sparse, however, makes use of annotations in the kernel source,
therefore it can catch problems that GCC, with its lack of
"domain-specific knowledge," simply cannot.  Its big drawback is that
it generates a lot of false positives.  From the audience, Darren Hart
noted that he uses Sparse regularly, but finds it problematic because
it runs on complete files, rather than on patches alone.  Therefore it
tends to generate a lot of warnings that, upon inspection, were
present in the original file and not the patch.   Mauro Carvalho Chehab replied that some subsystem maintainers made an effort to
remove all Sparse warnings in order to eliminate that particular
problem, though far from all.

<p>Bergmann also said he makes use of some extra GCC warnings to catch
additional bugs.  Kernel builds can employ a sort of "graduated"
warning level thanks to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a6de553da01c2c110c647fbd1c5bad29f5a82487">work</a>
by Michael Marek: the <tt>W=12</tt> switch includes all warnings from
<tt>W=1</tt> and <tt>W=2</tt>; <tt>W=123</tt> adds the <tt>W=3</tt>
warnings as well.  Using <tt>make&nbsp;W=1</tt> is generally useful, he
said, with <tt>W=12</tt> adding little of value in a lot more noise, and <tt>W=123</tt> being
clear overkill, mostly due to an "explosion" of false positives.  In the
arm-soc tree, for instance, <tt>W=1</tt> generates 631 instances of the
most common warning, <tt>W=12</tt> tops out at 94,235 for its top
offender, and <tt>W=123</tt> generates 782,719.  The
additional warnings of greatest interest to Bergmann include missing
headers and missing prototypes.  Bergmann also noted that he has
recently run build tests with GCC&nbsp;6, with promising
results among the <a
href="https://gnu.wildebeest.org/blog/mjw/2016/02/15/looking-forward-to-gcc6-many-new-warnings/">new warnings</a>&mdash;so far, he has written 32
patches based on GCC&nbsp;6 warnings.  Most have already been applied.

<p>Bergmann touched briefly on his experiments looking for build errors
and warnings with Clang.  That effort requires support from the
<a href="http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/index.php/Main_Page">LLVMLinux</a> project, of course, and at the moment the patch set
necessary to even compile the kernel with Clang is broken for
mainline.  But, since January (when he started his experiments), he
has found "tons of new warnings."  He eliminated the build errors
found with Clang on  <tt>randconfig</tt> builds, but has not yet
tackled writing patches for the warnings.  Clang also has a built-in
static analyzer, he noted, which can produce rather nice-looking
output and for which you can write your own checks, but he has not yet
had the time to work with it.

<p>Moving a bit further afield, he mentioned the proprietary Coverity
scanning tool, for which Dave Jones has done "some amazing work" to
record and annotate the known findings (which is necessary because
Coverity requires manual categorization of the bugs it finds).  The downside from Bergmann's
perspective, though, is that Coverity is x86-only.  He also pointed
the audience to Julia Lawall's <a
href="http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/">Coccinelle</a>, which can do
sophisticated pattern matching.  He has worked with it for his own
static checking, he said, though he has found it "really slow."
Consequently, it is not a tool he would use in his own work, though he
admitted he may be doing something wrong.

<p>Another tool Bergmann does not use regularly, but that he cited for
its "surprisingly good" warnings, is Dan Carpenter's <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/w/smatch.git">Smatch</a>.  Carpenter has used
it to catch thousands of bugs, he said, and pointed audience members
to Carpenter's recent <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linuxkernel/entry/smatch_static_analysis_tool_overview">blog
post</a> for further information.  Next, Bergmann highlighted the
convenience of the <a href="/Articles/514278/">0day build bot</a> maintained by Fengguang Wu; in
addition to monitoring public Git trees, it recently started testing
patch submissions and generating patches.  And, finally, he noted the
<a href="http://kernelci.org/">kernelci.org</a> build-and-boot testing infrastructure.  The most
interesting part of the project for Bergmann is that the service is
ARM-centric and the build farm includes a wide variety of machines.

<p>By that point in the session, time had run out, so there was not
much opportunity for the audience to ask questions.
Nevertheless, it was surely an informative look at how static code
checking benefits the arm-soc tree, where the ever-expanding list of
supported hardware makes for a daunting maintainer workload.
Furthermore, as Bergmann pointed out more than once, there are
benefits to squashing warnings in addition to compilation errors,
regardless of what code one is testing.

<p>
The <a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/">Squashfs compressed
filesystem</a> is 
used in everything from Live CDs to embedded devices.  Many or most
distributions ship it in such situations, but squashfs has been
maintained outside of the mainline kernel for years.  That appears to be changing as
it was recently <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/305058/">submitted for inclusion in the mainline</a> by Phillip Lougher.  The reaction has
been generally favorable, with Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/305128/">requesting that Lougher move it forward</a>:
"<q>Please prepare a tree for linux-next 
inclusion and unless serious problems are pointed out I'd suggest
shooting for a 2.6.29 merge.</q>"
  So it seems like a good time to take a look at some of the
features and capabilities of Squashfs.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea behind Squashfs is to generate a compressed image of a
filesystem or directory hierarchy that can be mounted as a read-only
filesystem.  This can be done to archive a set of directories or to store
them on a smaller capacity device than would normally be required.  The
latter is used by both Live CDs and embedded devices to squeeze more into
less. 
</p>

<p>
It has been nearly four years since Squashfs was last submitted to linux-kernel.
Since that time, it has been almost completely rewritten based on
comments from that attempt.  In addition, it has gone through two filesystem
layout revisions in part to allow for 64-bit sizes for files and
filesystems.  Another major change is to make the filesystem little-endian,
so that it can be read on any architecture, regardless of endian-ness.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>mksquashfs</tt> utility is used to create the image, which can then
be mounted either via loopback (from a file) or from a regular block device.
One of the features added since the original attempt to mainline
Squashfs&mdash;to address complaints made at that time&mdash;is the ability
to export a Squashfs filesystem via NFS. 
</p>

<p>
Squashfs uses gzip compression on filesystem data and metadata, achieving
sizes roughly one-third that of an ext3 filesystem with the same data.  The
<a
href="http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/SquashFsComparisons">performance</a>
is quite good as well, even when compared with the simpler cramfs&mdash;a
compressed read-only filesystem already available with the kernel.
According to Lougher, these performance numbers were gathered a number of
years ago, with older versions of the code; newer numbers should be even
better.
</p>

<p>
Previously, some kernel developers were resistant to adding another
compressed filesystem to the kernel, so Lougher outlines a number of
reasons that Squashfs is superior to cramfs.  Certainly support for larger
files and filesystems is compelling, but the fact that cramfs is orphaned
and unmaintained will likely also play a role.  In addition, Squashfs
supports many more "normal" Linux filesystem features like real inode
numbers, hard links, and exportability.
</p>

<p>
Morton had a laundry list of overall suggestions for making Squashfs better
in the email referenced above, but documentation is certainly one of the
areas that is somewhat lacking.  In particular, Squashfs maintains its own
cache, which puzzles Morton:
<div class="BigQuote">
Why not just decompress these blocks into pagecache
  and let the VFS handle the caching??
<p>
  The real bug here is that this rather obvious question wasn't
  answered anywhere in the patch submission (afaict). How to fix that?
<p>
  Methinks we need a squashfs.txt which covers these things.
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons that Squashfs doesn't use the page cache is that it
allows for multiple block sizes, from 4K up to 1M, with a default of 128K.
Better compression ratios can be achieved with a larger block size, but that
doesn't work well with the page cache as J&ouml;rn Engel 
<a href="/Articles/305133/">notes</a>: "<q>One of the problems seems to
be that your blocksize 
can exceed page size and there really isn't any infrastructure to deal
with such cases yet.</q>"
<p>
</p>

<p>
Lougher has moved the code into a <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/pkl/squashfs-2.6.git;a=summary">git
repository</a>, presumably in preparation to get it into linux-next.  He
notes that the <a href="http://celinuxforum.org/">CE Linux Forum</a> has
been instrumental in providing funding over the last four months to allow
him to work on getting Squashfs into the mainline.  With the additional
testing that will come from being included in linux-next, it seems quite
possible we could see Squashfs in 2.6.29.

Squashfs can also make use of lzma compression which achieves an amazing level of compression (depending upon the data, of course).  I believe that capability exists in 3rd party patches and is not part of the current, official SquashFS.  OpenWRT uses this for their router firmware images, and what they are able to pack into a few MB is nearly unbelievable.<br>

But AFAIK that depends on how the data was compressed, which parameters was used. You CAN do LZMA compression with extreme parameters which will only slightly improve compression but will take 100x the time and/or RAM usage for both encoding and decoding. Just use sane parameters when compressing the kernel and everything will be fine...<br>

But can you guarantee a maximum memory usage for decompressing?  With gzip you can allocate a 32kbyte window and a little bit of housekeeping and you're guaranteed to decompress any valid stream.  No dynamic memory allocation is needed.  Can LZMA say the same?<br>

If you're doing the compressing, you ought to be able to guarantee a memory limit for decompression. Just try decompressing while you still have the original around, and tweak the compression parameters if you run out of memory. That's how MPEG encoders work - consumer products that do mpeg stream decompression have a defined amount of memory (2Mbits, if I remember correctly).<br>
<p>
Admittedly that might be considered an expensive solution, but it proves that a solution exists.<br>

According to Wikipedia, "LZMA is effectively deflate (zlib, gzip, zip) with a larger dictionary size, 32MB instead of 32kB".<br>
<p>
It also say: "the amount of RAM required during decompression is principally determined by the size of the sliding window used during compression. Small code size and relatively low memory overhead, particularly with smaller dictionary lengths, make the LZMA decompression algorithm well-suited to embedded applications."<br>

I was going to post about LZMA support also. AFAIK the only reason it's not part of the official SquashFS is to make the LKML beards less resistant to including it in mainline. Too bad, because it makes quite a big difference  in read-performance on slow media such as CDs, NBD and USB sticks, and space on storage-starved embedded devices.<br>

      <p>Squashfs with LZMA support includes all this code in filesystem itself 
and that's "just wrong(tm)". It must be available for other pieces of 
kernel as well. I suppose squashfs developers can do this - but that's move 
patch from "yet-another-filesystem-patch" (easy to get approval and 
integrate) to "yet-another-patch-with-changes-to-core-API" (much harder to 
process). So the split is right. I sure hope developers will not stop at 
just adding squashfs but will proceed with LZMA support as well, but... 
later.</p>

Wow, at last this is happening! I've always wondered why didn't they do that. I've used squashfs numerous times in numerous projects, and never understood how such a popular filesystem can stay out of tree for such a long time. At last, this is changing.<br>
<p>
Btw, I'd vote for LZMA in squashfs as well. Used it, liked it.<br>

      <blockquote>
Another major change is to make the filesystem little-endian, so that it can be read on any architecture, regardless of endian-ness.

<p>
I'll bite.  What's the connection between being little-endian and being readable on all endianness machines?

I believe this is in contrast to always using the endianness of the machine you're on.  You could alternatively store the endianness in the FS itself, but if you just assume the endianness of the machine you're running on then you won't be able to read a given squashfs filesystem on both little- and big-endian machines.<br>

<p>
This is correct I believe.  mksquashfs would make it for the endian-ness of the machine it was run on (it also had options to make it for the other endian-ness for cross-fs-creation).  A kernel could only read a squashfs made for its endian-ness.  So, the fact that it is now little-endian is somewhat immaterial, it is that the endian-ness is fixed that matters.<br>

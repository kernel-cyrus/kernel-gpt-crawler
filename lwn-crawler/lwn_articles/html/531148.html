<p>
A section is an area in an object file that contains information which is useful
for linking: the program's code and data,
relocation information, and more.
It turns out that the Linux kernel has some additional types of sections, called
"special sections", that are used to implement various kernel
features. Special sections
aren't well known, so it is worth shedding some light on the topic.

<h4> Segments and sections </h4>

<p>  
Although Linux supports several binary file formats, ELF (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">Executable and
Linking Format</a>) is the preferred format since it is flexible and extensible
by design, and it is not bound to any particular processor or architecture.
ELF binary files consist of an ELF header followed by a few
segments. Each segment, in turn, includes one or more sections. The
length of each segment and of each section is specified in the
ELF header. Most segments, and thus most sections, have an
initial address which is also specified in the ELF header. 
In addition, each segment has its own access rights.
</p>

<p>
The linker merges together all sections of the same type included in the input
object files into a single section and assigns an initial address to it. For
instance, the <tt>.text</tt> sections of all object files are merged together
into a single <tt>.text</tt> section, which by default contains all of the
code in the 
program. 
Some of the segments defined in an ELF binary file are used by the GNU
loader to assign memory regions with specific access rights to the process.
</p>

<p>
Executable files include four canonical sections called, by convention,
<tt>.text</tt>, <tt>.data</tt>, <tt>.rodata</tt>, and <tt>.bss</tt>. The
<tt>.text</tt> section contains executable code and is packed into a segment
which has the read and execute access rights. The <tt>.data</tt> and
<tt>.bss</tt> sections  contain initialized and uninitialized data
respectively, and are packed into a segment which has the read and write access
rights. 

<p>
Linux loads the <tt>.text</tt> section into memory only once, no matter how many
times an application is loaded. This reduces memory usage and launch time and is
safe because the code doesn't change. For that reason, the
<tt>.rodata</tt> section, which contains read-only initialized data, is
packed into the 
same segment that contains the <tt>.text</tt> section.
The <tt>.data</tt> section contains information that could
be changed during application execution, so this section must be copied for
every instance.
</p>

<p>
The "<tt>readelf&nbsp;-S</tt>"
command lists the sections included in an executable file, while the 
"<tt>readelf&nbsp;-l</tt>" command lists the segments included in an
executable file. 

<h4> Defining a section </h4>

<p>
Where are the sections declared? If you look at a standard C program you won't
find any reference to a section. However, if you look at the assembly version of
the C program you will find several assembly directives that define the beginning of a
section. 

More precisely, the "<tt>.text</tt>", "<tt>.data</tt>", and
"<tt>.section rodata</tt>" directives identify the beginning of the the three canonical
sections mentioned previously, while the "<tt>.comm </tt>" directive defines an area
of uninitialized data.
</p>

<p>
The GNU C compiler translates a source file into the equivalent assembly
language file.
The next step is carried out by the GNU assembler, which produces an object
file. 
This file is an <em>ELF relocatable</em> file which contains only sections
(segments which have absolute addresses cannot be defined in a relocatable
file). Sections are now filled, with the exception of the
<tt>.bss</tt> section, which just has a length associated with it.
</p>

<p>

The assembler scans the assembly lines, translates them into binary code, and
inserts the binary code into sections. Each section has
its own offset which tells the assembler where to insert the next byte. The
assembler acts on one section at a time, which is  called the <em>current
section</em>. 
 In some cases,
for instance to allocate space to uninitialized global variables, the assembler
does not add bytes in the current section, it just increments its offset.
</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p> 
Each assembly language program is assembled separately; the assembler assumes
thus that the starting address of an object program is always 0.
The GNU linker receives as input a group of these object files and combines
them into 
a single executable file. This kind of linkage is called <em>static linkage</em>
because it is performed before running the program.
</p>

<p>
The linker relies on a linker script to decide which address to assign
to each section of the executable file.  To get the default script of your
system, you can issue the command:
<pre>
    ld --verbose  
</pre>
</p>

<h4> Special sections </h4>

<p> 
If you compare the sections present in a simple executable file, say one
associated with <tt>helloworld.c</tt>, with those present in the Linux
kernel executable, you will notice that Linux relies on many <em>special sections</em>
not present in conventional executable files. The number of such sections
depends on the hardware platform. On an x86_64 system over 30
special sections are defined, while on an ARM system there are about ten.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <tt>readelf</tt> command to extract data from the ELF
header of <tt>vmlinux</tt>, which is the kernel executable. When issuing this command on an x86_64 box
you get something like:
<pre>
    Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
    Entry point 0x1000000
    There are 6 program headers, starting at offset 64

<h4> Defining a Linux special section </h4>

<p>
Special sections are defined in the <em>Linux linker script</em>, which is
a linker 
script distinct from the default linker script mentioned above. The
corresponding source file is
stored in the 
<tt>kernel/vmlinux.ld.S</tt> in the architecture-specific subtree. This file uses a set of
macros defined in the <tt>linux/include/asm_generic/vmlinux.lds.h</tt> header
file.  
</p>

<p> 
The linker script for the ARM hardware platform contains an easy-to-follow
definition of a special section: 
<pre>
    . = ALIGN(4);
    __start___ex_table = .;
    *(__ex_table)
    __stop___ex_table = .;
</pre>
The <tt>__ex_table</tt> special section is aligned to a multiple of four bytes.
Furthermore, the linker creates a pair of identifiers, namely
<tt>__start___ex_table</tt> and <tt>__stop___ex_table</tt>, and sets their
addresses to the beginning and the end of <tt>__ex_table</tt>. Linux
functions can use these identifiers to iterate through the bytes of
<tt>__ex_table</tt>. Those identifiers must be declared as <tt>extern</tt>
because they 
are defined in the linker script.
</p>

<p>
Defining and using special sections can thus be summarized as
follows:
<ul>

<li> Define the special section "<tt>.special</tt>" in the Linux linker
script together with the pair of identifiers that delimit it.
<p>
<li> Insert the <tt>.section .special</tt> assembly
directive into the Linux code to specify that all bytes up to the next
<tt>.section</tt> 
assembly directive must be inserted in <tt>.special</tt>.
<p>
<li> Use the pair of identifiers to act on those bytes in the kernel.
</ul>

<p>
This technique seems to apply to assembly code only. Luckily, the GNU C compiler
offers the non-standard <tt>attribute</tt> construct to create special sections.
The
<pre>
    __attribute__((__section__(".init.data")))
</pre>
declaration, for instance, tells the compiler that the code following that
declaration must be inserted into the <tt>.init.data</tt> section.
To make the code more readable, suitable macros are defined. The
<tt>__initdata</tt> macro, for instance, is defined as:
<pre>
    #define __initdata __attribute__((__section__(".init.data")))
</pre>
</p>



<h4> Some examples </h4>

<p>
As seen in the previous <tt>readelf</tt> listing, all special
sections appearing in the Linux kernel end up packed in one of the segments
defined in the <tt>vmlinux</tt> ELF header. Each special section fulfills a
particular purpose.

The following list groups some of the Linux special sections according to the
type of information stored in them. Whenever applicable, the name of the macro
used in the Linux code to refer to the section is mentioned instead of the
special section's name.
</p>

<p>

<ul>
 

<li> Binary code 
<p> 

Functions invoked only during the initialization of Linux are declared as
<tt>__init</tt> and placed in the <tt>.init.text</tt> section. Once the system
is initialized, Linux uses the section delimiters to release the
page frames allocated to that section. 

<p> 

Functions declared as <tt>__sched</tt> are inserted into the
<tt>.sched.text</tt> special section so that they will be skipped by the
<tt>get_wchan()</tt> function, which is invoked when reading the
<tt>/proc/PID/wchan</tt> file. This 
file contains the name of the function, if any, on which process <tt>PID</tt> is
blocked (see <a href="http://weichong78.blogspot.it/2006/10/wchan-waiting-channel.html">WCHAN
the waiting channel </a> for further details). 

The section delimiters bracket the sequence of addresses to be skipped. The
<tt>down_read()</tt> function, for instance, is declared as <tt>__sched</tt>
because it gives no helpful information on the event that is blocking the
process.
</p>

<li> Initialized data 
<p> 

Global variables used only during the initialization of Linux are declared as
<tt>__initdata</tt> and placed in  the <tt>.init.data</tt> section. Once the
system is initialized, Linux uses the section delimiters to release the page
frames allocated to the section. 

</p>

<p>

The <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> macro makes the identifier passed as parameter
accessible to kernel modules. The identifier's string constant
is stored in the <tt>__ksymtab_strings</tt> section.

<li> Function pointers  

<p> 
To invoke an <tt>__init</tt> function during the initialization phase, Linux
offers an extensive set of macros (defined in <tt>&lt;linux/init.h&gt;</tt>);
<tt>module_init()</tt> is a well-known example.
Each of these macros puts a function pointer passed
as its parameter in a  <tt>.initcall<i>i</i>.init</tt> section (<tt>__init</tt>
functions are grouped in several classes). 
During system initialization, Linux uses the section delimiters to
successively invoke all of the functions pointed to.
</p>


<li> Pairs of instruction pointers   

<p> 

The <tt>_ASM_EXTABLE(addr1, addr2)</tt> macro allows the page fault exception
handler to determine whether an exception was caused by a kernel instruction at
address  <tt>addr1</tt>  while trying to read or write a byte into a process
address space. If so, the kernel jumps to <tt>addr2</tt> that contains the
<em>fixup code</em>, otherwise a kernel oops occurs. The delimiters of the
<tt>__ex_table</tt> special section (see the previous linker script example) set the
range of critical kernel instructions that transfer bytes from or to user
space. 

</p>


<li> Pairs of addresses   
<p> 

The <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> macro mentioned earlier also inserts in the
<tt>ksymtab</tt> (or <tt>ksymtab_gpl</tt>) special section a pair of
addresses:  the identifier's address and the address of the corresponding
string constant in <tt>ksymtab</tt> (or <tt>ksymtab_gpl</tt>). When linking a
module, the special sections filled by <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> allow the
kernel to do a binary search to determine whether an identifier declared as
<tt>extern</tt> by the module belongs to the set of exported symbols.


</p>

<li> Relative addresses 
<p> 

On SMP systems, the <tt>DEFINE_PER_CPU(type, varname)</tt> macro inserts the
<tt>varname</tt> uninitialized global variable of <tt>type</tt> in the
<tt>.data..percpu</tt> special section. Variables stored in that
section are called <em>per-CPU variables</em>. Since <tt>.data..percpu</tt> is
stored in a segment whose initial address is set to 0, the addresses of
per-CPU variables are relative addresses. 
During system initialization, Linux allocates a memory area
large enough to store the <tt>NR_CPUS</tt> groups of per-CPU variables.  The
section delimiters are used to determine the size of the group.
</p>

<li> Structures

<p>

The kernel's <a href="/Articles/164121/">SMP alternatives</a> mechanism
allows a single kernel to be built optimally for multiple versions of a
given processor architecture.  Through the magic of boot-time code
patching, advanced instructions can be exploited if, and only if, the
system's processor is able to execute those instructions.  This mechanism
is controlled with the <tt>alternative()</tt> macro:
<p>
<pre>
    alternative(oldinstr, newinstr, feature);
</pre>
<p>
This macro first stores <tt>oldinstr</tt> in the <tt>.text</tt> regular section.
 It then stores in the <tt>.altinstructions</tt> special
section a structure that includes the following fields: the address of the
<tt>oldinstr</tt>, the address of the  <tt>newinstr</tt>, the <tt>feature</tt>
flags, the length of the <tt>oldinstr</tt>, and the length of the
<tt>newinstr</tt>. It stores <tt>newinstr</tt> in a <tt>.altinstr_replacement</tt> special section. Early in the boot process, every alternative instruction
which is supported by the running processor is patched directly
into the loaded kernel image; it will be filled with no-op
instructions if need be.

</ul>

Additional special sections, besides <tt>__ksymtab</tt> and
<tt>__ksymtab_strings</tt>,  are introduced to handle modules. Kernel objects of
the form <tt>*.ko</tt> have an ELF relocatable format and the ELF
header of such files defines a pair of special sections called <tt>.modinfo</tt> and
<tt>.gnu.linkonce.this_module</tt>. Unlike the special sections of the
static kernel, these two sections are "address-less" because kernel objects do
not contain segments.

</p>

<p>
The <tt>.modinfo</tt> section is used by the
<tt>modinfo</tt> command to show information about the kernel module. The
data stored in the section is not loaded in the kernel address space.
The <tt>.gnu.linkonce.this_module</tt> special section includes a
<tt>module</tt> structure which contains, among other fields, the module's
name.  When inserting a module, the <tt>init_module()</tt> system call reads the
<tt>module</tt> structure from this special section into an area of dynamic
memory.


<h4> Conclusion </h4>

<p>
Although special sections can be defined in application programs too, there is
no doubt that kernel developers have been quite creative in exploiting them. In
fact, the examples listed above are by no means exhaustive and new special
sections keep popping up in recent kernel releases.  Without special
sections, implementing some kernel features like those above would be
rather difficult.

The title is arguably wrong, though: it should be titled 'Special sections in Linux kernel binaries', since it only relates to binaries *of* the Linux kernel, not (as I at first thought) to userspace binaries that run *on* Linux.<br>
<p>
(Also, the alternatives mechanism isn't just for boot time anymore: it can run at any time. CPU hotplugging needs this when transitioning from a one-CPU system to a system with more CPUs, but it's useful elsewhere as well.)<br>

It'd need to say "GNU/Linux" for that.<br>

No, this is in fact a valid use of Stallman's terminology, since the binaries being referred to are explicitly *Linux* binaries, that is to say, binaries of the Linux kernel itself. GNU/Linux binaries were what I at first thought the article was about, but the article has little to do with non-Linux-kernel stuff (other than things that also pertain to all ELF objects).<br>

I am sorry to bother, I would like to know how  the alternatives mechanism works. Do you have more detailed information? Or can you introduce it?<br>
I question that the alternatives mechanism means when the old instruction is accessed, then the corresponding new instruction position is executed by  the alternatives mechanism, or the old instructions has been covered by the new instructions? Thank you by the way.<br>
<p>
（很抱歉打扰了，我想请问一下替代机制是怎么工作的？我很好奇，它是在执行到旧指令的时候再去跳转到新指令的位置处去执行呢，还是系统将新指令拷贝到了旧指令的位置处，覆盖掉了旧指令这样的？谢谢！）<br>

I've used this in "iw" (<a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw</a>), but it turns out that it is problematic on Android, so one does well to not use such a thing in userspace.<br>

So because Android's dynamic linker/loader isn't perfect, it's best to restrain using a feature in your software ?<br>

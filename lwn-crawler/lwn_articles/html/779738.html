<h1>Per-vector software-interrupt masking</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">

           </div>
Software interrupts (or "softirqs") are one of the oldest
deferred-execution mechanisms in the kernel, and that age shows at times.
Some developers have been occasionally heard to mutter about removing them, but
softirqs are too deeply embedded into how the kernel works to be easily ripped
out; most developers just leave them alone.  So the recent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190212171423.8308-1-frederic@kernel.org/">per-vector
softirq masking patch set</a> from Frederic Weisbecker is noteworthy as an
exception to that rule.  Weisbecker is not getting rid of softirqs, but he
is trying to reduce their impact and improve their latency.
<p>
Hardware interrupts are the means by which the hardware can gain a CPU's
attention to signal the completion of an I/O operation or some other
situation of interest.  When an interrupt is raised, the currently running
code is (usually) preempted and an interrupt handler within the kernel is
executed.  A cardinal rule for interrupt handlers is that they must execute
quickly, since they interfere with the other work the CPU is meant to be
doing.  That usually implies that an interrupt handler will do little more
than acknowledge the interrupt to the hardware and set aside enough
information to allow the real processing work to be done in a
lower-priority mode.
<p>
The kernel offers a number of deferred-execution mechanisms through which
that work can eventually be done.   In current kernels, the most commonly
used of those is workqueues, which can be used to queue a function call to
be run in kernel-thread context at some later time.  Another is tasklets,
which execute at a higher priority than workqueues; adding new tasklet
users tends to be mildly discouraged for reasons we'll get to.  Other
kernel subsystems might use timers or dedicated kernel threads to get their
deferred work done.

<h4>Softirqs</h4>
<p>

Then, there are softirqs which, as their name would suggest, are a software
construct; they are patterned after hardware interrupts, but hardware
interrupts are enabled while software interrupts execute.  Softirqs have
assigned numbers ("vectors"); "raising" a particular softirq will cause the
handler function for the indicated vector to be called at a convenient time
in the near future.  That "convenient time" is usually either at the end of
hardware-interrupt processing or when a processor that has disabled softirq
processing re-enables it.  Softirqs thus run outside of the CPU scheduler as a
relatively high-priority activity.
<p>
In the 5.0-rc kernel, there are ten softirq vectors defined:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>HI_SOFTIRQ</tt> and <tt>TASKLET_SOFTIRQ</tt> are both for the
     execution of tasklets; this is part of why tasklets are discouraged.
     High-priority tasklets are run ahead of any other softirqs, while
     normal-priority tasklets are run in the middle of the pack.
<li> <tt>TIMER_SOFTIRQ</tt> is for the handling of timer events.
     <tt>HRTIMER_SOFTIRQ</tt> is also defined; it was once used for
     high-resolution timers, but that has not been the case since <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c6eb3f70d448">this change</a> was
     made for the 4.2 release.
<li> <tt>NET_TX_SOFTIRQ</tt> and <tt>NET_RX_SOFTIRQ</tt> are used for
     network transmit and receive processing, respectively.
<li> <tt>BLOCK_SOFTIRQ</tt> handles block I/O completion events; this
     functionality was <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ff856bad67cb">moved to softirq</a>
     mode for the 2.6.16 kernel in 2006.
<li> <tt>IRQ_POLL_SOFTIRQ</tt> is used by the <a
     href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0-rc6/source/lib/irq_poll.c">irq_poll
     mechanism</a>, which was <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/511cbce2ff">generalized</a> from the
     block interrupt-polling mechanism for the 4.5 release in 2015.  Its
     predecessor, <tt>BLOCK_IOPOLL_SOFTIRQ</tt> was <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5e605b64a183">added</a> for the
     2.6.32 release in 2009; no softirq vectors have been added since
     then. 
<li> <tt>SCHED_SOFTIRQ</tt> is used by the scheduler to perform
     load-balancing and other scheduling tasks.
<li> <tt>RCU_SOFTIRQ</tt> performs read-copy-update processing.  There was
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a26ac2455ffcf3">an attempt</a>
     made by the late Shaohua Li in 2011 to move this processing to a
     kernel thread, but performance regressions forced that change to be
     reverted shortly thereafter.
</ul>
<p>
Thomas Gleixner once <a href="/Articles/518993/">summarized</a> the
software-interrupt mechanism as "<q>a conglomerate of mostly unrelated
jobs, which run in the context of a randomly chosen victim w/o the ability
to put any control on them</q>".
For historical reasons that long predate Linux, software interrupts also
sometimes go by the name "bottom halves" — they are the half of interrupt
processing that is done outside of hardware interrupt mode.  For this
reason, one will often see the term "BH" used to refer to software
interrupts.
<p>
Since software interrupts execute at a high priority, they can create high
levels of latency in the system if they are not carefully managed.  As
little work as possible is done in softirq mode, but certain kinds of
system workloads (high network traffic, for example) can still cause softirq
processing to adversely impact the system as a whole.  The kernel will
actually kick softirq handling out to a set of <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> kernel
threads if it starts taking too much time, but there can be performance
costs even if the total CPU time used by softirq processing is relatively
low.
<p>
<h4>Softirq concurrency</h4>
<p>
Part of the problem, especially for latency-sensitive workloads, results
from the fact that softirqs are another source of concurrency in the system
that must be controlled.  Any work that might try to access data
concurrently with a softirq handler must use some sort of mutual exclusion
mechanism and, since softirqs are essentially interrupts, special care must
be taken to avoid deadlocks.  If, for example, a kernel function acquires a
spinlock, but is then interrupted by a softirq that tries to take the same
lock, that softirq handler will wait forever — the sort of situation that
latency-sensitive users tend to get especially irritable over.
<p>
To avoid such problems, the kernel provides a number of ways to prevent
softirq handlers from running for a period of time.  For example, a call to
<tt>spin_lock_bh()</tt> will acquire the indicated spinlock and also
disable softirq processing for as long as the lock is held, preventing the
deadlock scenario described above.  Any subsystem that uses software
interrupts must take care to ensure that they are disabled in places where
unwanted concurrency could occur.
<p>
Linux software interrupts have an interesting problem — interesting because
it is seemingly obvious but has been there since the beginning.  The
softirq vectors described above are all independent of each other, and
their handlers are unlikely to interfere with each other.  Network transmit
processing should not be bothered if the block softirq handler runs
concurrently, for example.  So code that must protect against concurrent
access from a 
softirq handler need only disable the one handler that it might race with,
but functions like <tt>spin_lock_bh()</tt> disable <i>all</i> softirq
handling.  That can cause unrelated handlers to be delayed needlessly, once
again leading to bad temper in the low-latency camp.
<p>
<h4>Per-vector masking</h4>
<p>
Weisbecker's answer to this is to allow individual softirq vectors to be
disabled while the others remain enabled.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1539213137-13953-1-git-send-email-frederic@kernel.org/">first
attempt</a>, posted in October 2018, changed the prototypes of functions
like <tt>spin_lock_bh()</tt>, <tt>local_bh_disable()</tt>, and
<tt>rcu_read_lock_bh()</tt> to contain a mask of the vectors to disable.
There was just one little problem: there are a lot of callers to those
functions in the kernel.  So the bottom line for that patch set was:
<p>
<pre>
    945 files changed, 13857 insertions(+), 9767 deletions(-)
</pre>
<p>
The kernel community has gotten good at merging large, invasive patch sets,
but that one still pushed the limits a bit.  That is especially true given
that almost all call sites still disabled all vectors; doing anything else
requires careful auditing of every change.  The second time around,
Weisbecker decided to take an easier approach and define new functions,
leaving the old ones unchanged.  So this patch set introduces functions
like:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int spin_lock_bh_mask(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned int mask);
    unsigned int local_bh_disable_mask(unsigned int mask);
    /* ... */
</pre>
<p>
After the call, only the softirq vectors indicated by the given
<tt>mask</tt> will have been disabled; the rest can still be run if they
were enabled before the call.
The return value of these functions is the previous set of masked softirqs;
it is needed when renabling softirqs to their previous state.
<p>
This patch set is rather less intrusive:
<p>
<pre>
    36 files changed, 690 insertions(+), 281 deletions(-)
</pre>
<p>
That is true even though it goes beyond the core changes to, for example,
add support to the lockdep locking checker to ensure that the use of the
vector masks is consistent.  One thing that has not yet been done is to
allow one softirq handler to preempt another; that's on the list for future
work.
<p>
No performance numbers have been provided, so it is not possible to know
for sure that this work has achieved its goal of providing better latencies
for specific softirq handlers.  Still, networking maintainer David Miller
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190212.102912.1498886718723769885.davem@davemloft.net/">indicated
his approval</a>, saying: "<q>I really like this stuff, nice
work</q>".  Linus Torvalds had some low-level comments that will need to be
addressed in the next iteration of the patch set.  Some other important
reviewers have yet to weigh in, so it would be too soon to say that this
work is nearly ready.  But, in the absence of a complete removal of
softirqs, there is clear value in not disabling them needlessly, so this
change seems likely to vector itself into the mainline sooner or later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That wouldn't be easy to do. It could easily miss out some subtleties, callback mazes, things hidden behind macros. Careful reviews plus some help from runtime analysis with lockdep seem to me the most reliable approach. But you have a point: we may not be able to test all the code we need to convert. The coverage is huge.<br>

"Bottom half" is an old term, and it had nothing to do with high-priority vs. low-priority interrupts.  Top half of (kernel/driver/networking/etc.) consists of the process-synchronous parts; bottom half is everything async.<br>
<p>
Hardware interrupts certainly belong in the latter.  So do software interrupts.  If anything, top half is *easier* to interrupt or preempt; the opposite of high-priority hwints.<br>
<p>
Linux originally had all bottom-half work done in hardware interrupt handlers.  Mechanism for doing bottom-half stuff outside of those had been added circa 0.98, when the first networking patchset went in.  Got labelled as "bh", without clear opposition to IRQ handlers...  Eventually, they've got renamed^Wreplaced with somewhat less sucky analogue called softirq.<br>
<p>
You'd probably have to ask Linus to find out what was the rationale for naming conventions, but I suspect that it was something along the lines of "mechanism for doing bottom-half stuff outside of hardware interrupts - those we already have a term for"...<br>

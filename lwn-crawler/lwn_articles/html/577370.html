           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 18, 2013</br>
           </div>
A "wait queue" in the Linux kernel is a data structure to manage threads
that are waiting for some condition to become true; they are the normal
means by which threads block (or "sleep") in kernel space.  Over the years, the
wait queue mechanism has evolved into a fairly elaborate and complicated
kernel subsystem.  Now, however, there is a move afoot to simplify that
code, using a wait queue variant developed for the realtime tree; the
result could be a fair amount of code churn in the kernel.
<p>
A look at <a href="/Articles/577374/"><tt>&lt;linux/wait.h&gt;</tt> from
the 2.0 kernel</a> reveals a simple data structure: a basic linked list of
waiting threads.  A <tt>wake_up()</tt> call on a wait queue would walk the
list, putting each thread into the runnable state; there was not a whole
more to it than that.  Then, in 1999, the infamous <a
href="http://www.mindcraft.com/whitepapers/first-nts4rhlinux.html">Mindcraft
study</a> pointed 
out some performance deficiencies in Linux; one of those was the
"thundering herd" problem where multiple processes would be awakened and
contend for a resource that only one of them could obtain.  As a result,
the "exclusive wait" functionality — where only the first of possibly many
waiting threads would wake — was added.  Then a callback mechanism was
added in the 2.5 series so that the new asynchronous I/O facility could
step in when things would otherwise block.  And so on.
<p>
The end result is a data structure that is far larger and  more complex
than it was in the 2.0 days.  It is the callback feature that was most
problematic for the realtime tree, though; since those callbacks can sleep,
they prevent the use of "raw" spinlocks to protect the wait queues
themselves.  To work around this problem, Thomas Gleixner created a new
"simple wait queue" mechanism that would dispense with most of the added
functionality and, thus, be suitable for use in the realtime kernel.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/572740/">2013 Realtime Linux Workshop</a> identified
this code as a candidate for a relatively easy move into the mainline.  In
response, Paul Gortmaker has extracted the simple wait queue facility and
<a href="/Articles/576773/">posted the resulting patch series</a> for
review.
<p>
The code looks a lot like a return to the 2.0 kernel; much of the
functionality that wait queues have gained in the meantime has been
stripped away, leaving a familiar-looking linked list of waiting threads.
There is 
no exclusive wakeup feature, no callback feature, and not much of anything
else.  What there <i>is</i>, though, is a wait queue mechanism that is
sufficient for the needs of most wait queue users (of which there are many)
in the kernel.
<p>
The API is similar to that of existing wait queues.  Wait queue entries and
wait queue heads are defined with:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/swait.h&gt;

    DEFINE_SWAITER(name);
    DEFINE_SWAIT_HEAD(name);
</pre>
<p>

The low-level API, which requires a direct call to <tt>schedule()</tt>
to put the calling thread to sleep, looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    void swait_prepare(struct swait_queue_head *head, struct swaiter *w, int state);
    void swait_finish(struct swait_queue_head *head, struct swaiter *w);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>swait_prepare()</tt> call is used to add the process to the given
wait queue <tt>head</tt> and put it into the appropriate sleeping
<tt>state</tt>.  After performing any necessary checks and calling
<tt>schedule()</tt>, the newly woken thread will call
<tt>swait_finish()</tt> to remove itself from the queue and clean up.
<p>
The current wait queue implementation has an extensive set of macros to
simplify the 
task of waiting for a condition; there is a similar, but much smaller set
for simple wait queues: 
<p>
<pre>
    void swait_event(queue, condition);
    int swait_event_interruptible(queue, condition);
    void swait_event_timeout(queue, condition, timeout);
    int swait_event_interruptible_timeout(queue, condition, timeout);
</pre>
<p>
Most of the other versions of <tt>wait_event()</tt>, including 
the <a href="/Articles/288056/">"killable" variants</a>, are not
provided.  It is amusing to look at a list of <tt>wait_event()</tt> macros
that lack equivalents in the new API, just to see how this interface has
grown over the years:
<p>
<pre>
    wait_event_cmd(wq, condition, cmd1, cmd2);
    wait_event_hrtimeout(wq, condition, timeout);
    wait_event_killable(wq, condition);
    wait_event_lock_irq_cmd(wq, condition, lock, cmd);
    wait_event_lock_irq(wq, condition, lock);
    wait_event_interruptible_hrtimeout(wq, condition, timeout);
    wait_event_interruptible_exclusive(wq, condition);
    wait_event_interruptible_locked(wq, condition);
    wait_event_interruptible_locked_irq(wq, condition);
    wait_event_interruptible_exclusive_locked(wq, condition);
    wait_event_interruptible_exclusive_locked_irq(wq, condition);
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_cmd(wq, condition, lock, cmd);
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq(wq, condition, lock);
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout(wq, condition, lock, timeout);
</pre>
<p>
There is little impediment to adding "simple" versions of most of the above
macros should the need arise; it will be interesting to see how many of
them show up in the coming years.
Needless to say, there is also nothing like <a href="/Articles/68118/">the
archaic <tt>sleep_on()</tt> 
interface</a>; it is safe to say nobody will try to add a version of that.

<p>
Paul's posting notes that adding the simple wait queues makes the kernel
smaller, even when they are only used in a couple of places.  Given the
size reduction and the relative simplicity of the interface, it is
unsurprising that there has been no opposition to adding this code so far.
The only real question is how that addition is to be done.  Christoph
Hellwig <a href="/Articles/577386/">suggested</a> that the simple wait
queues could simply replace the current implementation, with the few places
needing the fancier functionality being changed to use the older code under
a new name.  Paul, though, <a href="/Articles/577387/">worried</a> that
such a wholesale change would create a flag day with problems being
associated with the wait queue change in mysterious ways.
<p>

Nobody wants that kind of situation, so it seems more likely that simple
wait queues will retain their "swait" naming scheme.  The kernel
<i>might</i> see a wholesale naming change for the existing wait queues to
make it clear that there is now a choice to be made, though.  Thus, we may
see a large patch changing <tt>wait_event()</tt> to
<tt>cwait_event()</tt>, and so on, without changing functionality; after
that, individual call sites could be changed to simple wait queues at
leisure.  The result would be a fair amount of code churn, but that churn
should leave a smaller and simpler kernel in its wake.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Does anyone know if this API would be able to support lockdep annotations?<br>
<p>
The current waitqueues make that impossible, but unfortunately deadlocks are possible. The swait code doesn't contain any such annotations right now, but I think it would be very useful.<br>
<p>
With swait_prepare()/_finish(), it seems adding lockdep annotations might actually be possible?<br>

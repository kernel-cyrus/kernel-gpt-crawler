           </div>
The kernel's lowest-level primitives can be called thousands of times (or
more) every second, so, as one might expect, they have been ruthlessly
optimized over the years.  To do otherwise would be to sacrifice some of
the system's performance needlessly.  But, as it happens, hard-won
performance can slip away over the years as the code is changed and gains
new features.  Often, such performance loss goes unnoticed until a
developer decides to take a closer look at a specific kernel subsystem.
That would appear to have just happened with regard to how the kernel
handles preemption.
<p>
<h4>User-space access and voluntary preemption</h4>
<p>
In this case, things got started when Andi Kleen decided to make the
user-space data access routines — <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> and friends —
go a little faster.  As he explained in <a href="/Articles/562936/">the
resulting patch set</a>, those functions were once precisely tuned
for performance on x86 systems.  But then they were augmented with calls to
functions like <tt>might_sleep()</tt> and <tt>might_fault()</tt>.  These
functions initially served in a debugging role; they scream loudly if they are
called in a situation where sleeping or page faults are not welcome.  Since
these checks are for debugging, they can be turned off in a production kernel,
so the addition of these calls should not affect performance in situations
where performance really matters.
<p>
But, then, in 2004, core kernel developers started to take latency issues a
bit more seriously, and that led to an interest in preempting execution of
kernel code if a higher-priority process needed the CPU.  The problem was
that, at that time,  it was not exactly clear when it would be safe to preempt
a thread in kernel space.  But, as Ingo Molnar and Arjan van de Ven
noticed, calls to <tt>might_sleep()</tt> were, by definition,
placed in locations where the code was prepared to sleep.  So a
<tt>might_sleep()</tt> call had to be a safe place to preempt a thread
running in kernel mode.  The result was the <a
href="/Articles/93604/">voluntary preemption patch set</a>, adding a
limited preemption mode that is still in use today.
<p>
The problem, as Andi saw it, is that this change turned
<tt>might_sleep()</tt> and <tt>might_fault()</tt> into a part of the
scheduler; it is no longer 
compiled out of a kernel if voluntary preemption is enabled.  That, in
turn, has slowed down user-space access functions by (on his system) about
2.5µs for each call.  His patch set does a few things to try to make the
situation better.  Some functions (<tt>should_resched()</tt>, which is
called from <tt>might_sleep()</tt>, for example) are
marked <tt>__always_inline</tt> to remove the function calling overhead.
A new <tt>might_fault_debug_only()</tt> function goes back to the original
intent of <tt>might_fault()</tt>; it disappears entirely when it is not
needed.  And so on.
<p>
Linus had no real objection to these patches, but they clearly raised a
couple of questions in his mind.  One of his first comments was <a
href="/Articles/563187/">a suggestion</a> that, rather than optimizing the
<tt>might_fault()</tt> call in functions like <tt>copy_from_user()</tt>, it
would be better to omit the check altogether.  Voluntary preemption points are
normally used to switch between kernel threads when an expensive operation
is being performed.  If a user-space access succeeds without faulting, it
is not expensive at all; it is really just another memory fetch.  If,
instead, it causes a page fault, there will already be opportunities for
preemption.  So, Linus reasoned, there is little point in slowing down
user-space accesses with additional preemption checks.
<p>
<h4>The problem with full preemption</h4>
<p>

To this point, the discussion was mostly concerned about voluntary
preemption, where a thread running in the kernel can lose access to the
processor, but only at specific spots.  But the kernel also supports "full
preemption," which allows preemption almost anywhere that preemption has
not been explicitly disabled.  
In the early days of kernel preemption, many users shied away
from the full preemption option, fearing subtle bugs.  They may have been
right at the time, but, in the intervening years, the fully preemptible
kernel has become much more solid.  Years of experience, helped by tools
like the locking validator, can work wonders that way.  So there is little
reason to be afraid to enable full preemption at this point.
<p>
With that history presumably in mind, H. Peter Anvin entered the
conversation with <a href="/Articles/563188/">a question</a>: should
voluntary preemption be phased out entirely in favor of full kernel
preemption?

It turns out that there <i>is</i> still one reason to avoid turning on full
preemption: as Mike Galbraith <a
href="/Articles/563189/">put it</a>, "<q>PREEMPT munches
throughput</q>".  Complaints about the cost of full preemption have been
scarce over the years, but, evidently, it does hurt in some cases.  As long
as there is a performance penalty to the use of full preemption, it is
going to be hard to convince throughput-oriented users to switch to it.
<p>
There would not seem to be any fundamental reason why full preemption
should adversely affect throughput.  If the rate of preemption were high, there
could be some associated cache effects, but preemption should be a
relatively rare event in 
a throughput-sensitive system.  That suggests that something else is going
on.  A clue about that "something else" can be found in Linus's <a
href="/Articles/563190/">observation</a> that the testing of 
the preemption count — which happens far more often in a fully preemptible
kernel — is causing the compiler to generate slower code.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The thing is, even if that is almost never taken, just the fact
	that there is a conditional function call very often makes code
	generation *much* worse. A function that is a leaf function with no
	stack frame with no preemption often turns into a non-leaf function
	with stack frames when you enable preemption, just because it had a
	RCU read region which disabled preemption.
</div>
<p>
So configuring full preemption into the kernel can make
performance-sensitive code slower.  Users who are concerned about latency may
well be willing to make that tradeoff, but those who want throughput will
not be so agreeable.  The
good news is that it might be possible to do something about this problem
and keep both camps happy.
<p>
<h4>Optimizing full preemption</h4>
<p>
The root of the problem is accesses to the variable known as the
"preemption count," which can be found in the 
<tt>thread_info</tt> structure, which, in turn
lives at the bottom of the kernel stack.  It is not just a counter, though;
instead it is a 32-bit quantity that has been divided up into several
subfields:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The actual preemption count, indicating how many times kernel code has
     disabled preemption.  This counter allows calls like
     <tt>preempt_disable()</tt> to be nested and still do the right thing
     (eight bits).
<p>
<li> The software interrupt count, indicating how many nested software
     interrupts are being handled at the moment (eight bits).
<p>
<li> The hardware interrupt count (ten bits on most architectures).
<p>
<li> The <tt>PREEMPT_ACTIVE</tt> bit indicating that the current thread
     is being (or just has been) preempted.
</ul>
<p>
This may seem like a complicated combination of fields, but it has one
useful feature: the preemptability of the currently-running thread can be
tested by comparing the entire preemption count against zero.  If any of
the counters has been incremented (or the <tt>PREEMPT_ACTIVE</tt> bit set),
preemption will be disabled. 
<p>
It seems that the cost of testing this count might be reduced significantly
with some tricky assembly language work; that is being hashed out as of
this writing.  But there's another aspect of the preemption count that
turns out to be costly: its placement in the <tt>thread_info</tt>
structure.  The location of that structure must be derived from the kernel
stack pointer, making the whole test significantly more expensive.
<p>
The important realization here is that there is (almost) nothing about the
preemption count that is specific to any given thread.  It will be zero for
every non-executing thread; and no executing thread will be preempted if
the count is nonzero.  It is, in truth, more of an attribute of the CPU
than of the running process.  And that suggests that it would be naturally
stored as a per-CPU variable.  Peter Zijlstra has posted <a
href="/Articles/563088/">a patch</a> that changes things in just that way.
The patch turned out to be relatively straightforward; the only twist is
that the <tt>PREEMPT_ACTIVE</tt> flag, being a true per-thread attribute,
must be saved in the <tt>thread_info</tt> structure when preemption occurs.
<p>
Peter's first patch didn't quite solve the entire problem, though: there is
still the matter of the <tt>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</tt> flag that is set in the
<tt>thread_info</tt> structure when kernel code (possibly running in an
interrupt handler or on another CPU) determines that the currently-running
task should be preempted.  That flag must be tested whenever the preemption
count returns to zero, and in a number of other situations as well; as long
as that test must be done, there will still be a cost to enabling full
preemption.
<p>
Naturally enough, Linus has <a href="/Articles/563195/">a solution to this
problem</a> in mind as well.  The "need rescheduling" flag would move to
the per-CPU preemption count as well, probably in the uppermost bit.  That
raises an interesting problem, though.  The preemption count, as a per-CPU
variable, can be manipulated without locks or the use of expensive atomic
operations.  This new flag, though, could well be set by another CPU
entirely; putting it into the preemption count would thus wreck that
count's per-CPU 
nature.  But Linus has a scheme for dancing around this problem.  The "need
rescheduling" flag would only be changed using atomic operations, 
but the remainder of the preemption count
would be updated locklessly as before.  
<p>
Mixing atomic and non-atomic operations is normally a way to generate
headaches for everybody involved.  In this case, though, things might just
work out.  The use of atomic operations for the "need rescheduling" bit
means that any CPU can set that bit without corrupting the counters.  On
the other hand, when a CPU changes its preemption count, there is a small
chance that it will race with another CPU that is trying to set the "need
rescheduling" flag, causing that flag to be lost.
That, in turn, means that the currently executing thread will
not be preempted when it should be.  That result is unfortunate, in that it
will increase latency for the higher-priority task that is trying to run,
but it will not generate incorrect results.  It is a minor bit of
sloppiness that the kernel can get away with if the performance benefits
are large enough.
<p>
In this case, though, there appears to be a better solution to the problem.
Peter came back with <a href="/Articles/563259/">an alternative
approach</a> that keeps the <tt>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</tt> flag in the
<tt>thread_info</tt> structure, but also adds a copy of that flag in the
preemption count.  In current kernels, when the kernel sets
<tt>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</tt>, it also
signals an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) to inform the relevant CPU that
preemption is required.  Peter's patch makes the IPI handler copy the flag
from the <tt>thread_info</tt> structure to the per-CPU
preemption count; since that copy is done by the processor that owns
the count variable,  the per-CPU nature of that count is preserved and the
race conditions go away.  As of this writing, that approach seems like the
best of all worlds — fast testing of the "need rescheduling" flag without
race conditions.
<p>
Needless to say, this kind of low-level tweaking needs to be done carefully
and well benchmarked.  It could be that, once all the details are taken
care of, the performance gained does not justify the trickiness and
complexity of the changes.  So this work is almost certainly not 3.12
material.  But, if it works out, it may be that much of the throughput cost
associated with enabling full preemption will go away, with the eventual
result that the voluntary preemption mode could be phased out.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Indeed this article is a great summary of a complex subject - complex at least to me.  I see that the money I invested in the subscription is very hard at work.  :-)<br>

If throughput is that much more important than preemption, wouldn't "No Preemption" be a better choice for you anyway?<br>

<a href="/Articles/604609/">Control groups</a>
</div>
<p>While it may not be the most controversial feature ever added to
Linux, there is little difficulty in finding mailing lists or Internet forums
containing heated arguments about the merits of control groups — or
even downright denials that the feature has any merit at all.  Being bereft of
a personal agenda on the matter or any deep understanding of the
issues, I find it very hard to choose a side in these debates, which
seriously lessens the enjoyment I can receive from them.  As
synthesizing a deep understanding is, I find, much more noble than
synthesizing a personal agenda, and as having a discerning audience is
an excellent motivation for thorough research, these articles are
intended to help me and, hopefully, other readers to develop the deep
understanding necessary to truly enjoy an informed debate on Linux
control groups, which are also known as "cgroups".</p>

<p>
To gain this understanding we will need both a broad perspective and some
detailed analysis.  The first two articles in this series will try to provide
some perspective by first exploring the history of Unix to see what
questions it raises about process groups, and then looking at
hierarchies, both within and without the Unix family, to give us some
yardsticks to measure the hierarchical aspects of cgroups. 

<p>
Subsequent articles will then delve into the nitty gritty details of cgroups
and its various control subsystems and attempt to relate what we find to the
questions and metrics the broader perspective gave us.

<h4>Sixth Edition Unix</h4>

<p>
Unix has some history with process groupings and, more significantly, some
evolution.  Observing this change can help us to see important details.
While it would be nice to start at the very beginning, a more practical
starting point is the Sixth Edition of Unix, known hereafter as "V6 Unix".

<p>V6 Unix dates from
the mid-1970s and was the first edition to get much exposure outside
of Bell Labs.  It supports two different groupings of processes,
though to justify that we should first clarify what we mean by "a
grouping of processes".</p>

<p>As in number theory, not every set is a group.  The set of processes
with a prime identifying number, for example, is certainly a set.
However there is no mechanism in Unix (then or now) to distinguish these
processes in any way from those with composite ID numbers. 
The remaining set of processes, with neither a prime nor a
  composite ID number, does have a distinctive behavior. As it contains only
  PID 1, though, it is hardly worth considering as a group.

<p>A number-theoretic group includes an operation that operates on
members of the group with particular rules for what an "operation"
is.  For process groups, we will accept a much more vague concept and a
different role for an "operation", but still there must be some
operation within Unix which can affect, or be affected by, a
particular process group.</p>

<p>A less facetious set than the "prime PID" set would be the set of
processes owned by a given user ID (or "UID").  We won't consider this
to be a group in V6 Unix because while there are operations
(e.g. <code>kill</code>) that will affect processes in one group differently
from processes in another group, there is no way to interact with the
group as a whole.</p>

<p>The first set that really forms a meaningful group is the set of
children of some given process.  The only operation in V6 Unix which
recognizes this group is the <code>wait()</code> system call and it can only detect
if the group is empty or not empty.  If <code>wait()</code> returns with error <code>ECHILD</code>,
then the group is empty.  If it returns without an error, or doesn't
return, then the set wasn't empty when the call was made (though it
might be empty when the call completes).</p>

<p>The same operation could be interpreted as applying to the set of
descendants of the given process — that is, the children and any
children of those children, etc.  <code>ECHILD</code> is returned if and only if
this set is empty too.  This group has a significantly different
behavior, though.  In the group of children, a process cannot escape the
group except by exiting.  In the group of descendants, a process <em>can</em>
escape, if it is not an immediate child, when any ancestor of it
exits.</p>

<p>Whether the ability to escape is a valuable property of groups or not
depends, somewhat, on use-cases and expectations.  In V6 Unix, the
descendants of PID&nbsp;1 (that set with a unity ID number) cannot escape
but descendants of any other process can.  This remained the case
for variants of Unix and into Linux until Linux 3.4, when the <code>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</code> option for
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><code>prctl()</code></a> was added.  This allows a process to declare its
group of descendant processes as closed so processes cannot escape.
If any descendant dies, then all its children are inherited by the
process which set this option.</p>

<p>The other, possibly more interesting, process grouping present in V6 Unix
is determined by the <code>p_ttyp</code> field in the process structure
(defined in <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/sys/proc.h"><tt>proc.h</tt></a>), which is described as the "controlling tty".  Whenever a
process opens a "tty" device (see <tt>dhopen()</tt> in <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/sys/dmr/dh.c"><tt>dh.c</tt></a>), which would be a serial data connection
to a teletype or similar terminal, then if this field is not already
set, it will be set to point to the newly opened device.  The field is also
inherited over a <code>fork()</code> or <code>exec()</code>, so once a process gained a
controlling tty, that would continue to apply to the process and all
of its future descendants.</p>

<p>One effect of <code>p_ttyp</code> is that any I/O to <code>/dev/tty</code> will go to the
controlling tty, but this doesn't really qualify as a "group"
operation, as it affects individual processes separately.  The "group"
operations for controlling ttys involve the delivery of signals (see
<tt>signal()</tt> in <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/sys/ken/sig.c"><tt>sig.c</tt></a>).  If
a <code>DEL</code> or <code>FS</code> (<code>control-\</code>) character is typed on a tty, then
the signal <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>SIGQIT</code> is sent to all processes in the group
that have that tty as their controlling tty.  Similarly if a
disconnect event is detected (like a modem hanging up), a <code>SIGHUP</code>
is sent to the same group of processes. Signals can also be sent with the <code>kill()</code> system call.  An attempt to
send a signal to PID&nbsp;0 will send it to every process with the same
controlling tty as the sending process.</p>

<p>It is quite reasonable to think of this grouping as a prototype of
cgroups.  It is clearly about the grouping of processes and
clearly about controlling those processes &mdash; though only through
sending a signal.
These groups are created automatically, based on behavior, and are
permanent &mdash; once in a group, the process cannot escape.  It
appears that they were not perfect, though.  The next edition brought
changes.</p>

<h4>Seventh Edition Unix</h4>

<p>While V6 Unix supported process groups, it did not use that
terminology.  V7 Unix did, and had a richer concept of <em>group</em>.  
   The <tt>p_ttyp</tt> field still exists, though its role was restricted to managing
   <tt>/dev/tty</tt> access. It was renamed to <tt>u_ttyp</tt> and moved to
   <tt>struct user</tt> (<a
   href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/sys/h/user.h"><tt>user.h</tt></a>) — a structure that could be swapped out to disk with the rest of
   the process.  <tt>struct proc</tt> (<a
   href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/sys/h/proc.h"><tt>proc.h</tt></a>)
   instead had a new <tt>p_pgrp</tt> field to
   manage process groups.  It was set on the first <tt>open()</tt> of a tty
   and used for delivering <code>SIGINT</code>, 
<code>SIGQUIT</code> (which has now gained a 'U'), and <code>SIGHUP</code>, and for
delivering signals sent to PID&nbsp;0.  But V7 also brought more
flexibility.</p>

<p>The key change was that process groups now had an independent identity
and an independent name — independent of the tty, at least.  When a
process without a controlling tty first opened a tty, a new process
group would be created with an ID number matching the process ID number
of that process.  Though the ID was copied, it really was a new ID
for a new object. The group can continue to exist even if the original
process exits.  Any 
   remaining children will keep the group active and prevent the ID number
   from being reused, either as a process-group ID or as a process ID.</p>

<p>One consequence of this is that if you log off a tty and log back
on again, you get a new process group, and the <code>t_pgrp</code> field in
the <code>struct tty</code> structure will be changed.  Unlike the situation in
V6 Unix, a signal sent to a process group will never go to a process
from a previous login on the same tty.</p>

<p>Another consequence is that process groups could be used for more than
just ttys.  Seventh Edition Unix had a "multiplexor driver"
(<code>mpxchan</code> in <a
href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/sys/dev/mx1.c"><tt>mx1.c</tt></a>
and <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/sys/dev/mx2.c"><tt>mx2.c</tt></a>) which, though short-lived, still leaves a legacy in the
current <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html"><code>stat()</code></a> manual page:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
<pre>
3000   S_IFMPC         030000   multiplexed character special (V7)
[...]
7000   S_IFMPB         070000   multiplexed block special (V7)
</pre>
</div>

<p>The multiplexor worked a little bit like a socket interface and
allowed different processes to connect to each other.  An interface
was available to form a separate process group for several
interconnecting processes, so the master could send a signal to all
other members of the group.</p>

<p>V7 Unix process groups were still closed, with processes generally
unable to leave them. <code>mpxchan</code> does appear to allow a process to
leave its original process group to join a group for a multiplexed
channel, but it isn't clear that this was an intended consequence.</p>

<h4>Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution</h4>

<p>It is a bit of a large jump from V7 to 4BSD, having at least Unix 32v
and 3BSD in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history-simple.svg">the meantime</a>. But this is, to some extent, a personal
journey and 4.3BSD was the next release that I used.</p>

<p>In 4BSD, we find that a lot has happened with process groups.  In
4.3BSD, the set of processes with the same UID has become a group, in
that a signal can be sent to all processes  in that set (see
<tt>kill()</tt> in <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/kern_sig.c"><tt>kern_sig.c</tt></a>).
Sending a signal to a PID of -1 will deliver it to all processes
with the same UID as the sending process (though, if sent from a privileged
process, the signal will be sent to every process regardless of UID).
More significant is that by 4.4BSD there was now a limited
hierarchical structure to process groups.</p>

<p>One of the many innovations in the Berkeley versions of Unix was
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control_%28Unix%29">job control</a>".  A "job" here refers to one or more processes working
together on a particular task.  Unix already had the ability to put
some jobs in the "background", but it was implemented in a fairly <em>ad
hoc</em> manner.  Such processes would be told to ignore any signals from
the user (<code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGQUIT</code> would both be set to
<tt>SIG_IGN</tt> before starting the process) and the shell would simply
not wait 
for those processes to finish.  This mostly worked well, but once a
job was in the background, it had to stay there.  Also, if such a
process wrote to the terminal, its output could get mingled with
output from foreground processes, resulting in a mess.</p>

<p>With BSD "job control", each job is placed into its own process group
and the shell can tell the terminal to change its idea of which is
the current foreground job (and so would receive signals and input
and could generate output), and which jobs are in the background so they
should be isolated.</p>

<p>The pre-existing concept that process groups were essentially per-login
was still important, if only to provide a degree of compatibility with
"System V" Unix, a separate path of development from AT&amp;T.  In 4.4BSD,
these per-login process groups were re-introduced as "sessions".  Each
process (<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/proc.h"><tt>proc.h</tt></a>) was (potentially) a member of a process group.  Each
process group was a member of a session.  Each terminal (<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/tty.h"><tt>tty.h</tt></a>) had a
foreground process group, <code>t_pgrp</code>, and a controlling session,
<code>t_session</code>.</p>

<p>Sessions were, and are, much like the V7 Unix process groups, though
there are differences.  One is that it is not possible to send a
signal to all processes in a given session: that functionality only
works for process groups, which are now per-job.  Another is that a
process can leave its session and create a new one by simply calling
the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html
"><code>setsid()</code></a> system call.</p>

<p>Either of these are sufficient to frustrate the task of killing all
processes at logout — as local policy required in student labs a long
time ago in a career far away.  A frustration which was, at the time,
unfixable due to a dependence on closed-source kernels.</p>

<p>On a modern, windowed desktop, these sessions and process groups are
still present, but don't mean quite what they once meant.  It is
fairly easy to see how session IDs and process-group IDs are assigned
by displaying the <code>sess</code> and <code>pgrp</code> fields with <code>ps</code>, as follows:</p>

<pre>
    ps -axgo comm,sess,pgrp
</pre>

<p>There is no longer a well defined process grouping for a login session.
Instead, each terminal window gets its own session, as do various other
applications if they were written to request one.  Each job started
from the shell prompt still gets its own process group, but there is
much less need to start and stop these jobs — rather than suspending
the currently running job in one terminal window, it is just as easy
to pop up another window and run some new command there.</p>

<p>To properly represent the groupings of processes relevant for a modern
desktop, we really need a deeper hierarchy.  One level would represent
the login sessions, one would represent the applications running in
those sessions, and one could be used for jobs within an application.
The sessions and process groups that Linux inherits from 4.4BSD can
give us only two of those levels.  Maybe we can look to cgroups
for the third.</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>

<p>Reflecting on these changes and experiences with process groups, there
are a number of issues that may be worth considering when trying to
form an opinion on the more modern form of cgroups:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">
<li>
Names for groups: In V6 Unix the only name was that of the associated
   resource: a tty.  This changed to be an ID number in the same namespace
   as process ID numbers.  In retrospect this sharing of namespaces might
   seem a little clumsy, though it was clearly 
   convenient.  As the kernel was solely responsible for allocating
   names (another noteworthy feature), any clumsiness remained safely
   inside that kernel.</p>
</li>

<li>
Overlapping uses.  The same mechanism was originally used to guide
   both the delivery of signals and the processing of I/O to
   <code>/dev/tty</code>. These were quickly separated since they are clearly
   related, but are not identical.</p>
</li>

<li>
Should a process be able to escape its containing group?  We have
   seen a progression in the answer to this, from "no" to "yes".
   Having the flexibility can be useful in some cases, but having
   control can be useful in others.  Being able to enter a different
   job under the same session is easy to defend.  Being able to create
   a new session is not so obviously useful for an unprivileged process.</p>
</li>

<li>
What role does a hierarchy play?  Process groups have only gained even a
   limited hierarchy toward the end of their development.  Is this important?
     How can it be used?
</ul>

<p>
That last point, hierarchy, certainly is important.  A lot of the recent changes
in cgroups, and a significant part of the disagreements, relate to
hierarchy.  While the history of process groups has given us a glimpse of
hierarchy it is not enough to develop any real understanding.  For that we
will need to look elsewhere. 
In the next installment we will examine a few different "elsewheres" to
develop a perspective on hierarchy that we will then take to the inner
details of cgroups to see if the former can help us to better understand
the latter.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Given the move to replace built-in VTs with userspace functionality, I wonder how much of an overhaul it would take to replace built-in TTYs as well?  A TTY effectively seems like a pipe with an associated standard control channel (for things like "stop echoing").  The control channel could be emulated in userspace with a CUSE-based compatibility layer.  The "controlling TTY" concept could be replaced by cgroup-based job control, handled by the shell or the process providing the equivalent of a VT.<br>

You can build a kernel without VTs and use "screen" for multiplexing if you want to.<br>

Only if you use the built-in PTY driver, which is part of the TTY system.  I'm suggesting moving the complex and fragile TTY layer out of the kernel into userspace.<br>

And how would that make the tty layer less fragile ?<br>
How would serial port be handled ? How would the serial driver be accessed from the cuse driver ?<br>

It wouldn't necessarily make the TTY layer less fragile (although as a userspace framework it'd be easier to test and keep stable).  It would, however, help make the kernel less fragile.  TTY is one of the touchiest bits of the kernel, where what looks like a minor cleanup can break behavior that a 15-year-old version of emacs depends on.<br>
<p>
The kernel could provide raw-mode-only serial ports (a pure bytestream only), and allow the userspace TTY framework to provide any additional "cooked" functionality of ttyS* or ttyUSB* on top of that, analogous to how the kernel would not need need to provide tty[1-9]*.<br>

      There are two sensible ways to operate ps, BSD-style:
<pre>ps axo 'comm,sess,pgrp'
# g flag is obsolete</pre>
or POSIX-style:
<pre>
ps -eo 'comm,sess,pgrp'
</pre>
But <code>ps -axgo 'comm,sess,pgrp'</code> is nonsense, and ps has been warning about this for years.

      They haven't, <code>ps -aux</code> is somewhat common yet it breaks when there's a user named x.

Fabulous article: brings back memories of my first reading of Stevens's APUE: the intertwingled chapters on job control, signals and pgrps were memorable, in a terrifying way. I remember wishing it were possible to throw all this insane overcomplexity overboard and implement *one* mechanism to do all this.<br>

Alas, back-compatibility being what it is, we are lumbered with this legacy horror show forever.<br>

The article says "In V6 Unix, the descendants of PID 1 (that set with a unity ID number) cannot escape but descendants of any other process can." But isn't every process a descendant of PID 1, in which case no process can ever escape? What am I missing here?<br>

It just means, that because processes other than pid 1, may exit, their forked children can escape, so a wait for children won't see them.<br>
<p>
Say pid 20, forks many children, one pid 30 which starts a daemon pid 31, then pid 30 exits.  Now the daemon has "escaped" the "children of process 30" group.. aren't inherited by 20, but when they exit can only be reaped by pid 1.<br>
<p>
Funnily enough, I used Version 6 UNIX on a PDP11 and I do remember being confused once by signals delivered on my terminal, shortly after logging in on one occasion.  Having received the explanation, I was doing a ps, for a while &amp; choosing the "cool" seats, rather than deal with a repetition.<br>

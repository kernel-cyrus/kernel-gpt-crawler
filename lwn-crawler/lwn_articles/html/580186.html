<h1>Standardizing virtio</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 15, 2014</br>
           <hr>
<a
href="https://lwn.net/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2014-linux.conf.au">linux.conf.au 2014</a>
</div>
The Linux kernel has seen the development of a wide range of APIs over the
years, but few of those have been further developed into an official
standard blessed by a recognized standards body.  The <a
href="http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a> 
mechanism, which facilitates the implementation of 
virtual devices in guest systems running under hypervisors like KVM, may
soon be an exception.  Rusty Russell 
is the chief developer behind that effort; he started his <a
href="http://linux.conf.au/">2014 linux.conf.au</a> talk by noting that it
is still true that one can't fill a lecture hall by talking about
standards; indeed, there were one or two empty seats in the room to back up
that claim.
<p>
<h4>"What are the IP issues?"</h4>
<p>
I/O to virtual devices, Rusty said, differs from real device I/O in a few
significant ways.  With bare-metal devices, access to device registers
tends to be quite fast, but I/O register access for virtual devices, which
must be mediated by the hypervisor, is rather slower.  On the other
hand, access to memory from virtual devices is direct and fast, while real
devices require an expensive DMA setup operation.  These differences drive
people to create paravirtualized drivers (drivers that are aware that they are
dealing with virtualized devices) in order to get the best
performance.  Creating a special class of devices for virtualized guests is
horrible, he said, but if you're going to do 
something that's really horrible, you should try to do it well.

Virtio is thus an attempt to do paravirtualized I/O well.  
<p>
A fair amount has happened since 
virtio got its start with the first implementation in the Linux kernel in
2007.  By 2009, a draft specification existed and, in a development that
took Rusty by surprise, Virtualbox 3.1 shipped with virtio-net support.  By
2011, Linux had support for the virtio memory-mapped I/O bus.  In 2012, the
Galaxy Nexus handset used virtio to offload multimedia tasks to hardware

accelerators; this development, Rusty said, was "cool and random."
Adoption is picking up in a number of areas; by later this year, FreeBSD
should have support in its <a
href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/action/show/bhyve?action=show&redirect=BHyVe">BHyVe</a>
hypervisor.

<p>
In 2012, ARM Ltd. decided that it wanted to use virtio in the
implementation of its 
<a href="http://www.arm.com/products/tools/models/fast-models/">Fast
Models</a> system.  So they contacted Rusty, asking what the
"intellectual property issues" were around the virtio specification.  He
answered that it was all just a blog posting, and that they could do with
it as they would; this was evidently not an answer that made ARM's lawyers
happy; they contacted lawyers within IBM and the question eventually
reached him from the other side.
<p>
There is, Rusty said, a process for publishing a white paper from within
IBM.  He's not quite sure what that process is, but it was made it clear
to him "in a series of long meetings" that it cannot be described as "post
the specification on your blog, promote it for years, then wait for
somebody to ask about the IP issues."  IBM's internal processes, it seems,
work a bit differently than that.
<p>

This episode suggested that it was time to put together a proper standard
for virtio.  At this point, the barriers to adoption of virtio were not
technical; instead, they were legal and political.  Having a published
standard will encourage adoption for larger enterprises which, in turn,
will make it harder for other projects to go off and do their own thing.
Going through the standardization process also presents an opportunity to fix up a
number of small issues that have come up over time.  The end goal of the 
process is to try  to create a straightforward, efficient, and
extensible standard.
<p>
"Straightforward" implies that, to the greatest extent possible, devices
should use existing bus interfaces.  Virtio devices see something
that looks like a standard PCI bus, for example; there is to be no
"boutique hypervisor bus" for drivers to deal with.  "Efficient" means that
batching of operations is both possible and encouraged; interrupt
suppression is supported, as is notification suppression on the device
side.  "Extensible" is handled with feature bits on both the device and
driver sides with a negotiation phase at device setup time; this mechanism,
Rusty said, has worked well so far.  And the standard defines a common ring
buffer and descriptor mechanism (a "virtqueue") that is used by all
devices; the same devices can work transparently over different transports.


<h4>Changes for virtio 1.0</h4>
<p>
Another way of putting it was that the standardization effort was
undertaken with the goals of keeping the good 
parts of virtio, discarding the bad parts, and making the ugly parts
optional.  The first step in that direction was to recast the specification
into RFC-style language.  Rather than suggesting that a driver "should
check" that a given feature is supported before trying to use it, the
standard says that drivers "MUST check."  And so on.
<p>
One of the first thing authors of virtio drivers will notice is the
addition of a new feature bit called <tt>VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1</tt>.  It is,
he said, the first mandatory feature bit in the standard; it indicates that
the driver implements version 1.0 and does not require legacy support.  A
couple of other feature bits (<tt>F_ANY_LAYOUT</tt> and
<tt>F_NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY</tt>) have been removed.  The former was the "I
actually read the damn standard" bit, Rusty said, while the latter
indicated the presence of a bug workaround that was never used, since simply
fixing the bug turned out to be a better course of action.
<p>
The in-memory virtqueue layout has been made more flexible; the original
version could require large, physically contiguous allocations that may
fail on a system with fragmented memory, while version 1.0 splits
that allocation up.  Virtqueue size can also be negotiated by drivers now.
A complex interaction between "multipart descriptors" (arrays of memory
descriptors stored outside of the main ring) and the "next" bit (used to
create 
multipart descriptors within the main ring) has simply been removed; nobody was
using it anyway, Rusty said.
<p>
The status byte provided by drivers was subject to race conditions, since
there was no way to know when the driver had finished accepting (or
rejecting) proposed features.  There is now a <tt>FEATURES_OK</tt> bit to
mark the end of the negotiation process; clearing this bit is also a way of
indicating that negotiation has failed.  There is a new atomicity counter
associated with the optional device-specific configuration area; by
checking the counter before and after reading a field in this area, code
can notice if something changes and retry accordingly.
<p>
There have been relatively few changes to virtio-net; the biggest is the
removal of <strike>support</strike> the <tt>VIRTIO_NET_F_GSO</tt> bit for
generic segmentation offloading (GSO).  Supporting 
GSO was complicated, eventually requiring a few separate feature bits, 
and the overall feature bit was never used.  The virtio-block
driver has seen the removal of a number of feature bits; the "barrier"
feature was unused, while "flush" is now compulsory.  More complicated
drivers that used to be implemented with virtio-block, Rusty said, 
should now use virtio-scsi instead.
<p>
The virtio-balloon driver has a number of problems, including its own
approach to endianness issues.  It uses unaligned fields for the stats
virtqueue, and has a "compulsory optional" feature bit to tell the
hypervisor that pages are being pulled out of the balloon.  Rather than try
to fix these problems, the standard committee chose to simply remove
virtio-balloon from the standard altogether.
<p>
Endianness has, Rusty said, been a problem for virtio in general.  The
initial specification said that byte ordering would be whatever the guest
expected; the idea is simple, but it turned out not to be straightforward
to implement.  The balloon driver got it completely wrong, but it was not
the only driver with problems.  So, with version 1.0 of the specification,
the ordering is simply set to be little-endian.  This change will create
some difficulties for people working on s390; Rusty thanked them for
"taking the bullet" to enable this simplification of the standard.
<p>
The process of creating and publishing the virtio standard is being run
through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>, (Organization for
the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).  Rusty said that he
put some time into picking the right organization, looking for one that was
interested in the creation of useful standards without a lot of unnecessary
hoops to jump through.  He was warned during the selection process that
some standards groups exist primarily to slow things down, which wasn't
what he was after.  Thus far, development of the standard through OASIS has
been going well.
<p>
The first draft of the standard was released on December 24; Rusty allowed
as to how some members of the audience might not have noticed it at the
time.  The second draft is to be expected "in a few months."  The work can
all be found on <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/virtio">the
OASIS virtio committee page</a>; comments are welcome.  The whole process,
Rusty said, has taken rather longer than he had hoped and has not always
been fun, 
but the result, with luck, will be a standard for paravirtualized devices
that will be widely adopted.

Well, I have one. :)<br>
<p>
Support for generic segmentation offloading (GSO) was not removed.  The feature _bit_ was never used, as it's replaced by 4 more specific bits for different aspects of GSO, but GSO is definitely being used together with virtio.  You say it quite clearly in the talk around minute 28.<br>

<p>Care to elaborate? From 0.9.5 I thought that setting (ACK | DRIVER | DRIVER_OK) completes feature negotiation. (Section 2.2.1 step 6.)</p>

<p>Or is it about the ordering between setting feature bits and reading config space <em>during</em> feature negotiation?</p>

Apparently a generalisation of Tanenbaums famous observation about standards is that the nice thing about standards bodies is that there's so many to choose from.<br>

Rusty's point that correct choice of standards body makes a huge difference is spot on. I could back this with some person anecdotes, but this is a public forum and I've no desire to put offside groups I need to deal with in the future. OASIS is a good choice: software is their core business, but more importantly OASIS are in it for the right reasons and everything else they do flows from that.<br>
<p>
One trap is the some groups make it relatively simple to create a standard, but then you lose control of the maintenance to the standards organisation. Which means the maintenance never happens. So it's worthwhile whilst creating the standard to do the groupwork to establish the procedures within the standards organisation for maintenance (which might be as simple as specifying an initial period for the meeting of a maintenance development committee made up of industry participants which have implemented the standard).<br>
<p>
Since this isn't an exchange format there's not much value in pushing the result to the ISO PAS or JTC1 Fast Track. The point of doing that would be that the typical language of tenders specifies a precedence of standards in which international standards trump industry consortia standards. That's unlikely to matter for virtio but can be vitally important for exchange formats (a lot of the reason the the OSI protocols got any traction was the lack of "international standard" designation for the IETF protocols).<br>

<h1>A firewall for device drivers</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 13, 2021</br>
           </div>
Device drivers, along with the hardware they control, have long been
considered to be a trusted part of the system.  This faith has been under
assault for some time, though, and it fails entirely in some situations,
including virtual machines that do not trust the host system they are
running under.  The recently covered <a
href="/Articles/865216/">virtio-hardening work</a> is one response to this
situation, but that only addresses a small portion of the drivers built
into a typical kernel.  What is to be done about the rest?  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210804174322.2898409-1-sathyanarayanan.kuppuswamy@linux.intel.com/">driver-filter
patch</a> from Kuppuswamy Sathyanarayanan demonstrates one possible
approach: disable them altogether.
<p>
Virtual machines typically have direct access to little or no physical
hardware; instead, they interact with the world by way of emulated devices
provided by the host.  That puts the host in a position of power, since it
is in total control over how those virtual devices work.  If a driver has
not been written with the idea that the devices it manages could be
hostile, chances are good that said driver can be exploited to compromise
the guest and exfiltrate data — even when the guest is running with
encrypted memory that is normally inaccessible to the host.
<p>
The virtio work hardens a handful of virtio drivers to prevent them from misbehaving if
the host decides to not play by the rules.  Getting there was a lot of work
(which still has not reached the point of being merged), and there is a
decidedly non-zero chance that vulnerabilities remain.  Even if the virtio
work is perfect, though, the kernel contains thousands of other drivers,
most of which have not received anything close to the same amount of
attention; few of them can be expected to be sufficiently
robust to stand up to a malicious device.  If the host can convince a guest
to load the driver for such a device, the security game may well be over.
<p>
One possible solution to this problem is to methodically go through and
harden all those thousands of until-now neglected drivers.  The result
would surely be a better kernel, but holding one's breath for this outcome
would be ill-advised.  Even if the developer effort for such a project can
be found, there is a lot of code that would have to be tested
with a large array of devices, a significant number of which stopped being
widely available many years ago.  Any realistic plan must accept that many
drivers will never be hardened in this way.

</blockquote>
<p>
The alternative is to simply make those drivers unavailable; a driver that
cannot run at all is unlikely to compromise the system.  Most virtual
machines only need a handful of drivers; the rest are just dangerous dead
weight.  The obvious thing to do is to build a kernel with only the needed
drivers, yielding a result that is not only safer, it will also be much
smaller.  The problem with this idea is that distributors hate the idea of
shipping multiple kernels with different configurations.  Each one adds to
the build, test, and support loads, and it only takes a few configuration options
to create a large array of kernel images.  Distributors are thus highly
motivated to ship a single kernel image if possible.
<p>
This is where Sathyanarayanan's patch set comes in; it provides a way for
the system administrator to control which drivers are allowed to run.  It
adds two new command-line options — <tt>filter_allow_drivers</tt> and
<tt>filter_deny_drivers</tt> — for that purpose; specific drivers can be added
to either list using a "<tt>bus:driver</tt>" notation.  The string
"<tt>ALL</tt>" matches anything.  So, for example, booting a system with:
<p>
<pre>
    filter_allow_drivers=ALL:ALL
</pre>
<p>
will allow all drivers to run — the default situation.  The allow list is
applied first and overrides the deny list, so a configuration
like this:
<p>
<pre>
    filter_allow_drivers=pci:e1000 filter_deny_drivers=ALL:ALL
</pre>
<p>
will allow the e1000 network adapter driver to run, but will block
everything else.  There is also a new driver attribute in sysfs (called
<tt>allowed</tt>) that can be used to change a driver's status at run time.
<p>
Driver subsystem maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YQrqhYEL64CSLRTy@kroah.com/">was not impressed</a>
with this submission; he suggested either building a special kernel image
or using the existing mechanisms to block unwanted device drivers instead.  These
could include denying them in the system's <tt>modprobe</tt> configuration
or using the knobs in sysfs to unbind drivers from their devices.  As Andi
Kleen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f2b1d564-8174-f8e9-9fee-12e938c6d846@linux.intel.com/">explained</a>,
though, these mechanisms do not quite satisfy the requirements.
Configuring <tt>modprobe</tt> does not help with built-in drivers and, in
any case, the intent is to prevent untrusted drivers from running at all.
By the time user space can manually unbind a driver, it has already set
itself up in the kernel and may already be trying to drive a malicious
device. 
<p>
Another way of looking at the situation, Kleen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/e96bc698-89ca-3c67-d0ba-adecc50e8a53@linux.intel.com/">added</a>,
is to see a guest running on a potentially hostile host as being like a
server on the Internet.  The server almost certainly runs a firewall to
restrict access to ports that are known (or at least hoped) to be safe; the
driver filter is the equivalent of the firewall for the guest.  That
simplifies the hardening problem to the point that it might be feasible.
<p>
Whether these arguments will convince Kroah-Hartman remains to be seen; the
conversation went quiet without reaching any sort of definitive
conclusion.  The problem that is driving this work seems real, though; if
the current solution does not make the cut, we are likely to see other
attempts to do something similar in the future.  Devices have gone from
hiding behind the kernel to being a part of the kernel's attack surface;
security-focused developers will naturally want to reduce that surface as
much as possible.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This seems awkward to handle via a full list on the kernel command line. I wonder if this could use the existing driver signing infrastructure with a slight extension: Have two (or more) different signatures on each module, with different keys, and on the command-line pass which key &quot;slot&quot; to use to verify modules. That effectively allows selecting among &quot;module sets&quot; determined at compile time.<br>

That has a similar problem as building different kernel versions. If on a VM I administer, what if I need to enable one extra driver? I might be using PCI pass through, for example. I&#x27;d have to either switch to the unrestricted set, decreasing security of the VM, or build a new kernel with a third set of signatures. <br>

We could just abandon the concept of modular kernels, but then we&#x27;re back to 1995...  It&#x27;s secure.  The kernel will have an exactly known set of drivers, but a LOT of modern admins will NOT know how to recompile the kernel to change that set.<br>

This sounds like a solution in search of a problem<br>
<p>
I believe all mainstream distros let you select which drivers should go in the initrd (pretty sure most even have tooling to find a reduced, if not minimal set). As long drivers are built as modules, you can just not include banned drivers in the initrd, and stick modprobe blacklists.<br>
<p>
The only situation that doesn&#x27;t cover is built-in modules (which should both be rare, and usually/always nonsensical to blacklist).<br>
<p>
Of course this doesn&#x27;t include a solution to bootstrap it, but neither does the proposed solution.<br>

<p>
Unfortunately the VM itself can change the blacklists, and obtain the modules from somewhere and insmod them.  When your goal is to ensure someone who has taken over the VM can&#x27;t escape from it, that&#x27;s not a solution.<br>
<p>
However, a simple sysfs &quot;blown fuse flag&quot; (ie, one you can not change back) that turns off module loading would work.  You just run set it in the initrd, after it&#x27;s loaded all the modules.  There already is a corresponding capability.<br>

I thought this article was going to be about hardware level firewalls, so I had prepared a comment about PCIe message signalled interrupts and the requirement to write directly to the interrupt controller from an external device... having RTFA, I see I’ll need to wait for another time to see how hardware firewalls are done. I can definitely see how a rough bus master or interrupt source could wreak havoc on a system.<br>

Back in the old days, I used to compile static kernels that had only the exact device drivers I wanted, on the theory that module loading was not secure. <br>
<p>
I remain convinced that this is the case, and that static kernels would be safer, completely removing a giant attack space.  <br>
<p>
This was a long time ago, so I could be misremembering, but I believe I was forced to stop doing this because the kernel stopped supporting static compilation; it was loadable modules or nothing.   <br>

That would mean CONFIG_MODULES (or its equivalent) was broken. I would be surprised if it still is.<br>

I used to do this also. Usually once you get a config that builds a kernel that boots your system you use it for the base of new kernels’ config, so the work is mostly one time (this as they mess with new config options etc. you might have to edit it a little, but not so frightful as the first one. <br>

I used to do it as well, spending large amounts of time and attention. I think this is exactly the problem and the reason people (including me) prefer not to have do it anymore.<br>

ISTR Linux has a localmodconfig make target that could be used for this; build a full kernel, boot it on the hardware you want, note the loaded modules, and using localmodconfig build a kernel config with those modules and then turn CONFIG_* with =m into =y and build the result.<br>

I still run a (almost) only static kernel. I think you&#x27;re misremembering when kernels grew too big to fit in the space available for 32-bit. So a lot of stuff had to be compiled as modules to prevent there be loads of unused code that stopped the kernel from loading.<br>
<p>
You&#x27;d need to do a bit of work, but not that much - gentoo users do it all the time :-) Just download the distro source kernel, do a lsmod to see what modules are loaded, then alter the config so those modules are compiled in. Leave out the &quot;make modules&quot; and &quot;make modules_install&quot; steps, and you should have a module-free kernel.<br>
<p>
If you learn there are modules you missed, you can go down one of two routes. Either make a note of them to compile them into your kernel, or manually install them into /lib/modules or wherever they go.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

There are even nifty options like &quot;make localmodconfig&quot; which gives you an excellent starting point for selecting which modules you need.<br>
<p>
Of course that only copies the currently loaded modules, but the thoery is if you currently running system supports most (or even all) the functionality you need, then those are a good base.<br>

The problem I&#x27;ve had with not having modules is with built-in wifi drivers detecting hardware before the root partition with the firmware is mounted, and not retrying later. Since everybody builds the drivers as modules, the assumption is that the firmware will be available as soon as the driver code is available. I could work around it (unbind and rebind the device once userspace is ready), but I don&#x27;t really want to use an arrangement that clearly nobody else is testing.<br>

While I have never gotten it to consistently work for GPUs (in theory there is a dependencies list you could jump through... I&#x27;ve never management to find it), for well written Wifi drivers, you should be able to unbind them (via sysfs), and then rebind them. Which should result in a new firmware request.<br>
<p>
I believe buildin modules can also pull firmware from the initrd (since firmware loading has been move into the kernel, for reasons).<br>

Could we instead tag each driver as &quot;hardened&quot;. Then in virtualized (and other) environments we set a flag to allow only hardened drivers, built-in or not. Plus of course some whitelist, which should be hopefully smaller. At least the effort to review and harden drivers can be shared by community instead of each admin doing it separately.<br>
Maybe the hardening flag could be a bit mask to tell what kind of hardenings have been done on it. Aka input validation, iommu support etc<br>

TCP is a patient protocol; if a remote peer stops responding, it will wait
a long time (measured in minutes, by default) in the hope that connectivity
will eventually return. 
Sometimes, however, that wait is undesirable; that is especially true
when it is known that the connection will not be
coming back, but that the establishment of a replacement connection may
succeed.  As it happens, mobile networking often presents such situations.
The <a href="/Articles/664839/"><tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt> patch set</a> from
Lorenzo Colitti is an attempt to improve the user experience in such
situations.  It fills a clear need, but has run into some opposition
anyway; it also shows that the rift between the Android and kernel projects
has not yet been entirely closed.
<p>
Imagine, for a moment, a user streaming $SPORTING_EVENT on a phone
handset over a WiFi connection.  Said user walks out the door, away from
the WiFi network's coverage; that will cause the stream to freeze, probably
at the beginning of the bit of action that decides the entire game.  The WiFi
connection is gone and is not coming back, but the streaming application
does not know that, so it will wait a long time, in vain, for data to show
up on its network socket.  After several minutes, the connection will time
out.  The application will then realize that it has been disconnected and
will try to reconnect; that new connection, going over the phone's
broadband interface, will succeed.  Streaming recommences, and our poor
user gets to watch the post-game
sportscasters talking about the one-of-a-kind play that happened while the
stream was frozen.  The resulting handset-destroying rage could have been
avoided if the application had not waited for the network timeout to occur.
<p>
There are other scenarios that can create similar problems; placing a
system onto a virtual private network (VPN) is another example.  When this
kind of network change occurs, things would work better if applications knew
immediately that their
open connection was never going to produce another packet.  There are
a number of ways this information could be conveyed, but one of the more
straightforward ways would be to simply close the socket, returning an
error to the application.  That is what the <tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt> patch set
makes possible.
<p>
In particular, it adds a <tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt> to the netlink-based "socket
diag" mechanism, first <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/eaaa31392690c7609f7afeec5ba38a79d009842d">added
to the kernel</a> in the 3.10 development cycle.  A suitably privileged
process (<tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt> is required) can use this operation to
close an arbitrary socket owned by another process; that process will see
an <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt> error.  As it happens, that error is the same that is
returned when a socket times out, but the pain of actually waiting for the
timeout has been taken away.  Any application that is prepared for such
errors (and applications running in mobile environments, at least, should
be) should recover and reconnect with no changes required.
<p>
As it happens, the Android kernel has had this capability since 2008,
though in a different form: Android currently supports an <tt>ioctl()</tt>
command called <tt>SIOCKILLADDR</tt>.  This patch set is an attempt to move
this capability upstream, cleaning it up a bit along the way.  The fact
that this feature has been shipped with Android suggests that there is a
real need for it, but a number of concerns were raised anyway.
<p>
Tom Herbert <a href="/Articles/666234/">worried</a> that this facility
could be used by an administrator to close sockets for any reason and that
the affected application would have no way to know that this had happened.
He suggested that the error code returned could be changed to
<tt>ENETRESET</tt>, so that an explicit action to close a socket would not
be presented as if it were a passive timeout.  A <a
href="/Articles/666592/">later version of the patch set</a> changes the
return code to <tt>ECONNABORTED</tt>, which was chosen to be compatible
with what BSD systems do.
<p>
Hannes Frederic Sowa <a href="/Articles/666236/">suggested</a> that, in
some cases, quickly closing a socket in this manner could cause old data to be
delivered to the wrong socket.  Networking maintainer David Miller <a
href="/Articles/666238/">agreed</a> with that concern, and suggested an
alternative: the closing of sockets could be handled by the operation that
disconnects them from the network in the first place.  So, for example, the
removal of a route associated with a disappeared network could cause any
sockets bound to that network to be closed.  David made it clear that he
wants to have the kernel, rather than user space, in charge of deciding
which sockets should be closed.
<p>
The problem with that approach, <a href="/Articles/666240/">according to
Lorenzo</a>, is that the kernel doesn't always have a way to know which
sockets have been affected by a networking change.  The VPN case, in
particular, can muddy the waters considerably.  Beyond that, it was pointed
out that user space can also force sockets to be closed by killing
applications directly or installing special firewall rules.  The new
operation just makes this kind of action easier to carry out.  Lorenzo did,
however, change the patch to send a reset (set the RST bit) to the peer
when a socket is closed as a way of reducing the chances of protocol
confusion. 
<p>
Eric Dumazet <a href="/Articles/666243/">came in</a> with a request that
the change be merged.  He noted that: "<q>Every time I make a change in
linux TCP stack, this code breaks, and this a real pain because Android
changes need to be carried over to vendors.</q>"  Getting the
<tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt> patch merged would spare him the phone calls and
allow him to get more work done on the rest of the networking code.  He
also noted that the commonly suggested alternative of having applications
do their own keep-alive processing is not really viable in the mobile
environment for a couple of reasons.
<p>
Finally, Eric pointed out that TCP is competing with the <a
href="/Articles/558826/">QUIC protocol</a> in the mobile
space.  QUIC is based on UDP and can react quickly to changes in the
networking environment; without a similar ability to react, he said, TCP is
not competitive.
<p>
David then <a href="/Articles/666244/">complained</a> that the Android
developers still do not really care about the upstream kernel — a complaint
that your editor still occasionally hears over beer at conferences.  The
fact that Android has been carrying this patch for something like seven
years does not, in his mind, constitute a reason to merge it quickly into
the mainline.  Indeed, he said, Android's developers should be prepared to
wait for a while as the patch's merits are considered:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You have been considering this non-stop for whatever time you have
	been working on this, everyone else is now considering and thinking
	about this for the first time right now.

	Therefore you must be understanding and patient.  Just like I've
	been patiently waiting for my Nexus 6 to be updated to something
	newer than 2+ year old kernel technology.
</div>
<p>

Lorenzo <a href="/Articles/666245/">responded</a> that he would like to see
things change in this area, with more Android code going upstream.  The
posting of the <tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt> patch set was a part of the effort to
bring that about.  Almost everything that the Android networking group has
done in the last two years has been sent upstream, he said.
<p>
As was recently <a href="/Articles/662147/">discussed</a> at the 2015
Kernel Summit, Android-based devices run a lot of out-of-tree code;
indeed, they may be running more out-of-tree code than upstream code.  The
portion of that code contained within the Android project's repositories is
relatively low, though, and there does appear to have been an effort to
reduce it in recent years.  But it's clear that some resentment remains in
the kernel development community.  In the end, though, that resentment is
unlikely to prevent the merging of needed functionality.  By the time it
gets upstream, this feature may or may not look like
<tt>SOCK_DESTROY</tt>, but it can be expected to do something similar.
Mobile devices are not going away and the kernel community, in the end,
wants to support them as well as possible.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Windows has another issue - if a network interface goes down then all the connections for this interface go down as well and you can't override it.<br>

This is extremely annoying if you want, for example, to switch from wired to wireless connection (and your router is set up to assign the same IP to both).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The problem with that approach, according to Lorenzo, is that the kernel doesn't always have a way to know which sockets have been affected by a networking change.</font><br>
<p>
Since TCP is bound to a source IP address that would have to be pretty rare.<br>
<p>
To me the issue is even if the kernel does know the interface the TCP connection runs over has gone down, at least for me it's nice if it doesn't destroy it immediately.  Having your ssh connection stay up when there is a glitch in connectivity can be a real bonus, to the extent that I turn off keep-alives to ensure ssh doesn't notice.  So changing kernel behaviour to unconditionally kill all TCP connections doesn't sound wonderful.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, having a user space application that allows me to kill some sockets matching some criteria (IP address, interface or whatever) would be nice.  Providing the functionality effectively pushes the policy into userspace, which is surely where it belongs.<br>

Dug Song's <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">dsniff package of tools</a> contains a nifty little app called "tcpkill" which can do this (the criteria specified via tcpdump-style BPF rules)...  It just forges RSTs, so a nicer method like this would still be useful, but I just wanted to mention this tool, because it can sometimes be useful...

kcpkill works only if there is some traffic to be captured (and if so, you have to wait for such traffic to appear)<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 20, 2018</br>
           </div>
The furor over the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities has calmed a bit —
for now, at least — but that does not mean that developers have stopped
worrying about them.  Spectre variant&nbsp;1 (the bounds-check bypass
vulnerability) has been of particular concern because, while the kernel is
thought to contain numerous vulnerable spots, nobody really knows how to
find them all.  As a result, the defenses that have been developed for
variant&nbsp;1 have only been deployed in a few places.  Recently, though,
Dan Carpenter has <a href="/Articles/752409/">enhanced</a> the <a
href="/Articles/691882/">smatch</a> tool to enable it to find possibly
vulnerable code in the kernel.
<p>
Spectre variant 1 is the result of the processor incorrectly predicting the
results of a bounds check; it then speculatively executes code with a
parameter (such as an array index) that falls outside of its allowed
range.  This problem can be <a href="/Articles/746551/">mitigated</a> by
disabling speculative execution in 
situations where an array index is under the control of a potential
attacker.  In the kernel, that is done by replacing code like:
<p>
<pre>
    value = array[index];
</pre>
<p>
with:
<p>
<pre>
    index = array_index_nospec(index, ARRAY_SIZE);
    value = array[index];
</pre>
<p>
That's the easy part; the hard part is finding the places in the kernel
where the <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> macro should be used.  Until now,
the only tool available has been the proprietary Coverity checker, which is
not accessible to everybody and produces a fair number of false positives.
As a result, there are only a handful of <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt>
calls in current kernels.
<p>
Carpenter's addition to smatch changes that situation by providing a free
tool that can search for potential Spectre variant-1 vulnerabilities.  The
algorithm is simple enough in concept:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	What the test does is it looks at array accesses where the user
	controls the offset.  It asks "is this a read?" and have we used
	the array_index_nospec() macro?  If the answers are yes, and no
	respectively then print a warning.
</div>
<p>
This test returns a list of about 800 places where
<tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> should be used.  Carpenter assumes that a
large percentage of these are false positives, and has asked for
suggestions on how the test could be made more accurate.  Instead of
offering suggestions, though, both <a href="/Articles/752410/">Thomas
Gleixner</a> and <a href="/Articles/752411/">Peter Zijlstra</a> confirmed
that a number of the reports were accurate; Zijlstra said "<q>I fear
that many are actually things we want to fix</q>".  He followed up with
<a href="/Articles/752412/">a patch series</a> fixing seven of them —
nearly doubling the number of <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> calls in the
kernel.
<p>
Once the low-hanging fruit has been tackled, there probably will be a focus
on improving the tests in smatch to filter out the inevitable false
positives and to be sure that vulnerable sites are not slipping through.
But, now that there is a free tool to do this checking, progress in this
area can be expected to accelerate.  Perhaps it will be possible to find —
and fix — many of the existing Spectre vulnerabilities before the attackers
get there.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Is this something new or did I live my life without nowing it is there? :)<br><br>

<p>
I wonder why we think there will inevitably be false positives.  That would only be the case if we humans understood the problem better than smatch.<br>
I suspect that for the vast majority of developer, the description given in red in the article is very close to all we really know - and smatch already knows exactly that.<br>
Even then, it may be a lot closer to "accepting" that it is correct rather than "understanding" that it is.  This really is something outside our experience.  I went to look at a couple of nfsd examples and thought "no, that code is fine"... then I realized that I was missing the whole point and in reality they are quite possibly susceptible to spectre.<br>
<p>
I think it is entirely possible that smatch will achieve a much lower error rate than developers would - certainly than I would.<br>

The difficulty likely comes mostly from the first bit:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; What the test does is it looks at array accesses **where the user controls the offset**.</font><br>
<p>
Knowing if the user can control the offset may be rather hard to know so easily. <br>
<p>
(Disclaimer, I have never used smatch and it has been years now since I even compiled a custom kernel, and my knowledge of static analysis tools is certainly not up to speed either. All to say, I could be completely wrong and smatch knows perfectly if something is user controlled. Or not. don't ask me!)<br>

I am the author of Smatch.<br>
<p>
Smatch tries to track "the user can set this variable to 0,20-30.".  It's pretty important information so I've put a lot of effort into that.<br>
<p>
Sometimes it's tricky when you are dealing with function pointers.  Sometimes you function pointers like -&gt;set_foo() and the caller always passes user data.  That's pretty straight forward.<br>
<p>
But maybe the caller looks like  "if (user_var &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; user_var &lt;= dev-&gt;max) dev-&gt;set_foo(user_var);"  Then that's trickier and I just record that "user_var" has been capped.  This isn't very granular and I have a few ideas about how to improve it.<br>
<p>
But then there are things like timer functions where the data and function are closely tied.  If there is one timer function that takes user data, the default behavior in Smatch would be to mark every timer function as taking user data.   What I do there is use a script to tweak the cross function database to remove that.  <a href="http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/HEAD:/smatch_data/db/fixup_kernel.sh">http://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/HEAD:/smatch_data/db/fi...</a>  The kernel is small enough that you can often manually hack around false positives.<br>

      <p>I'm a big fan of having testing tools that would allow us to get errors sooner. Yet, my first impressions with regards to this new feature is that such warnings should be taken very carefully.

[PATCH 01/11] media: tm6000: fix potential Spectre variant 1</a>
<p/><p>
Basically, it tries to "fix" prediction of reading the content of a this static table (with is not modified by the Kernel):
<p/>
<pre>
static struct tm6000_fmt format[] = {
	{
		.name     = "4:2:2, packed, YVY2",
		.fourcc   = V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUYV,
		.depth    = 16,
	}, {
		.name     = "4:2:2, packed, UYVY",
		.fourcc   = V4L2_PIX_FMT_UYVY,
		.depth    = 16,
	}, {
		.name     = "A/V + VBI mux packet",
		.fourcc   = V4L2_PIX_FMT_TM6000,
		.depth    = 16,
	}
};
</pre>
<p>
E. g. all that a "spectre" branch prediction hacking tool would be doing is to guess that someting like: <pre>$ v4l2-ctl --list-formats</pre> would be returning:
<p/>
<pre>
$ v4l2-ctl --list-formats
ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
	Index       : 0
	Type        : Video Capture
	Pixel Format: 'YUYV'
	Name        : YUYV 4:2:2

	Index       : 1
	Type        : Video Capture
	Pixel Format: 'UYVY'
	Name        : UYVY 4:2:2

	Index       : 2
	Type        : Video Capture
	Pixel Format: 'TM60'
	Name        : A/V + VBI Mux Packet
</pre>
<p>
With is quite obvious by just looking at the code (with it would be required anyway to write such spectre-exploitation tool).
<p/><p>
And just knowing that the tm6000 was loaded and was bound to a hardware is enough to get exactly the same data, without needing to do some complex code to exploit Spectre. In other words, just  a <code>cat /proc/modules</code> is usually a good hint.
<p/><p>
The thing is: I can't foresee <b>any</b> way where the above could actually be exploited by some hacker. The same applies to several other similar "fixes" that, without a real threat scenario, seems just a false positive.
<p/><p>
My point is: just blindly test the Kernel without a real threat scenario and start flooding the Kernel with patches that will just add extra latency to syscalls seems just plain wrong on my eyes.

      I may misunderstand what Spectre is capable of, but isn't the concern that normal bounds-checking in the original code is irrelevant?  So Spectre could be used to read anything sufficiently near to that table in kernel memory space.  You may be correct that nothing interesting is near the table, but the table contents per se are not the concern.

Specifically at tm6000-core, the only static vars there are the ones that either contain structs with const data or modprobe parameters (and the table itself). Granted, it could try to read memory elsewhere, but, as far as I understand, "elsewhere" is actually limited to L1 cache size, with, in practice, should very likely be restricted to what's there at tm6000 module.<br>

I don't see why that would be the case. An attacker could set e.g. f-&gt;index = 0x80000000. The CPU may (incorrectly) speculatively predict the bounds check will pass, then speculatively read format[f-&gt;index].name (which is about 32GB after 'format'), then speculatively execute the strlcpy and read characters from that name string. Any read can leak information about the address that was accessed (via its effect on the caches), and in this case the address is the value at an attacker-controlled location in a ~64GB region after 'format', so the attacker could use it to leak the contents of potentially sensitive memory.<br>

According to <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832</a> , a main memory access is 20 times as slow as a mispredicted branch, 100 ns versus 5 ns. I can imagine designs that would do speculative main memory accesses, but even before Spectre, the cost of loading something that won't be used into a cache (and ejecting what's actually going to be used) and clogging the memory bus to turn a 100 ns load into a 95 ns load seems unproductive.<br>

The benefit can be much bigger than that. E.g. in code like "struct { int n; bool last; char pad[56]; } *p; while (!p-&gt;last) { sum += p-&gt;n; ++p; }", if you did all the loads and branches sequentially based on their dependencies, it would take ~100ns per iteration (since you can't start the next load of p until you've checked the result of the the previous load). But if you predict the branches then you can queue up dozens of (speculative) loads at once, and complete dozens of iterations per 100ns (limited only by memory bandwidth and queue sizes), which is a massive improvement. That extra parallelism is worth a tiny reduction in cache efficiency.<br>
<p>
(In practice you'd need slightly more complicated code to avoid simply being optimised by the cache prefetcher etc, but presumably that kind of code comes up enough in benchmarks and/or real applications to be a worthwhile optimisation, given that Intel has been doing it for two decades.)<br>

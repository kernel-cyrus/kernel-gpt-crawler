<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2013-Linux_Security_Summit">Linux Security Summit</a>
</div>
<p>
The 2013 <a
href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Security_Summit_2013">Linux
Security Summit</a> (LSS) had many different talks over its first day.  It
started with Ted Ts'o's <a href="/Articles/567977/">keynote</a>, then had
several "refereed" talks (two of which were covered
here: <a href="/Articles/568943/">Embedded integrity</a> and <a href="/Articles/569635/">Kernel ASLR</a>).  The day ended with a selection of short topics, which were mostly
updates on 
various security subsystems (SELinux, Smack, and Integrity).
Unfortunately, there isn't enough time to write all of them up, but we will
complete our LSS coverage with reports from two kernel-related talks.
</p>

<h4>LSM composition</h4>

<p>
Composing (or stacking) Linux Security Modules (LSMs) has been a perpetual
topic in kernel security circles.  We have looked at the problem and
solutions many times over the years (most recently <a
href="/Articles/563178/">in August</a>).  Casey Schaufler has been working
on a solution to the problem over the last few years.  He presented the
problem and his solution to the assembled security developers looking for
guidance on where to go from here.
</p>

<p>
The problem in a nutshell is that there can be only one LSM active on any
given boot of the kernel.  But there are multiple use cases for having more
than one active.  Many think that certain combinations (e.g. SELinux and
Smack) do not make sense, but there are reports of people who want to be
able to combine arbitrary LSMs.  In addition, only allowing a single LSM
restricts systems with multiple containers to only using one
security model, when it might be desirable to support all of them for use
in different containers.
</p>

<p>
There is also the problem of special-purpose LSMs.  Whenever someone brings
up an idea for a new way to tighten security in the kernel core, they are
almost inevitably pointed in the direction of the LSM API.  But, since many
distributions already ship with the single LSM slot filled, those smaller
LSMs are unlikely to be used.  Yama started off as a special-purpose LSM,
but it was eventually manually—unconditionally—stacked so that it could
coexist.  That was 
meant as a temporary change until stacking was added to the kernel, but
without a stacking solution, its temporary nature is somewhat in question.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler's proposal still follows the broad outlines we <a
href="/Articles/518345/">described</a> a year ago.  It has added the
ability to stack any and all of the existing LSMs, which was not working
at that point.  It has also added a user-space interface that has separate
directories for each LSM under <tt>/proc/PID/attr</tt>.  It now tries to
deal with labeled networking by restricting the different mechanisms
(NetLabel, XFRM, and secmark) each to a single LSM per boot.  The first LSM
that asks for a given network labeling scheme "gets it". The details
are available in Schaufler's <a 
href="http://selinuxproject.org/~jmorris/lss2013_slides/casey_Glass2013.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a> as well as the <a href="/Articles/560802/">patches</a>. 
But the point of his talk was mostly to get feedback and ideas on whether
it was an idea worth moving forward with.
</p>

<p>
Some were not particularly happy with the user-space interface and/or the
networking changes, believing that they added too much complexity.  Others
seemed skeptical that stacking was ever a sensible thing to do.  But
several folks spoke up from the 
audience about how they currently use multiple LSMs and have to carry
out-of-tree patches to make it all work.  In addition, the standard stacking
arguments were restated.  There <i>is</i> a clear demand for the
feature—whether that is enough to overcome the objections remains to be seen.
</p>

<p>
In a post-presentation discussion, Paul Moore and Schaufler explored the
possibility of pushing forward the stacking core, while leaving some of the
"messier" pieces (like the user-space interface and labeled networking
handling) as later additions.  Most or all of the stated use cases would be
fully 
served by a "simplified stacking" solution.  The other pieces could
continue to be worked on, or possibly dropped if there were no real users
for them.  That sounded like the approach that will be tried next, but, so
far, patches have not yet appeared.

<h4>Core kernel anti-patterns</h4>

<p>
There are lots of known "anti-patterns" for kernel code, like busy waiting
or hardcoding values, but <i>security</i> anti-patterns are not as
well-known, Kees Cook said at the beginning of his talk.  He and others
have been spending some time trying to find "obvious" bugs in the kernel, some
of which fall into the anti-pattern category.  His talk was meant to
document some of them to hopefully avoid them in the future.
</p>

<p>
It is frustrating that he can so easily find security holes in the kernel,
he said.  In addition, Dan Carpenter has been using <a
href="http://smatch.sourceforge.net/">smatch</a> to find more examples of
these anti-patterns once someone has found the first instance.  Cook
suggested that perhaps <tt>checkpatch.pl</tt> could be extended to catch
some of this bad code long before it ever reached the kernel.  He also
suggested that kernel developers just go look for other examples of
"something ugly" when they find such bugs—surprisingly often they will find
many more instances.
</p>

<p>
Format strings are one source of these errors.  For example:
<pre>
    printk(buffer);
</pre>
If the user can influence what goes into the buffer, they can put format
specifiers into it, which can cause havoc.  Fixing the problem is as easy as:
<pre>
    printk("%s", buffer);
</pre>
GCC can be used to help find these kinds of problems, using the
<tt>format</tt> and <tt>format-security</tt> warning/error flags, but it
is, unfortunately, "dumb" about <tt>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</tt>, so it will
complain even for static buffers that are not exploitable.
</p>

<p>
A related problem is the addition of the "<tt>%n</tt>" format specifier,
which writes the number of characters written to an address that is passed
as an argument on the stack.
It was not added to the kernel until 2009 and is only used for padding
calculations in procfs output.  But it is the format specifier of choice
for those performing format string attacks.  He would like to see support
for that specifier removed entirely: "I don't care about prettiness if it
leaves <tt>%n</tt> as an attack vector."
</p>

<p>
String manipulation is another area with lots of low-hanging fruit.  He
noted that <tt>strncpy()</tt> is generally a safer call than some others
(e.g. <tt>strcpy()</tt>),
but you have to check the length of the destination, not the source.
<pre>
    strncpy(dest, src, strlen(src));
</pre>
can sometimes be found and it will leave the <tt>dest</tt> string without a
NULL termination.  He suggested that for purposely leaving the
destination unterminated, one should use <tt>memcpy()</tt> to make it clear.
</p>

<p>
Another problem that is fairly easy to find is unchecked
<tt>copy_*_user()</tt> calls.  The
return from those is the number of bytes not copied, which typically
indicates some 
kind of error.  So calling those routines without checking the return value can
lead to security holes.  Various graphics drivers are currently guilty, he said.
</p>

<p>
Reading from the same user-space location twice can lead to a race
condition where the value changes between the two reads.  It is a hard race
to win, but still a problem.  This often happens when the first part of a
structure being read from user space is the length of the
data.  The length is read in, the structure is allocated, then the whole
thing (length and all) is read into the new structure.  If the length
changes between the reads, it can lead to problems.  He has found this
anti-pattern in 
both the kernel and U-Boot.
</p>

<p>
A problem similar to the double-read occurs in drivers for unusual
devices.  USB human interface devices (HID) have a complex way of describing
the data being delivered.  In a week's time, he found 12 CVEs in that
code using malicious hardware.  He verified each using a <a
href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2012/07/emulating-usb-devices-with-python.html">Facedancer</a>
a software-defined USB device, which allows him to write a Python script that
acts like a USB device.  In the future, he plans to look for problems in
the mass storage and webcam USB drivers.
</p>

<p>
Cook said these kinds of bugs are an indication that the "many eyes" theory
is failing in some areas.  He knows this because he keeps finding the same
kinds of bugs whenever he has time to look.  There are tools that could
help, including stronger GCC default flags and using the GCC plugins from
the PaX project.  Coccinelle and smatch are also useful.  It is important
that we get more proactive, he said, and keep these anti-patterns from ever
getting into the kernel to begin with.

They want their programming languages back.<br>
<p>
Seriously, does anybody else think it's pathetic that we still have to deal with format string vulnerabilities and buffer overflows? It's time that the kernel community acknowledges the fact that ordinary programmers (i. e. other than gurus like djb) can't write secure code in C. Rust will probably be a viable candidate for parts of the kernel code once it reached its 1.0 release. Not to mention that probably most of the code would be way shorter and cleaner in Rust due to superior abstraction facilities.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Rust is probably not even in the first hundred 'new secure languages that the kernel should be re-written in to solve all the evils of the world'</font><br>
I never claimed that any language will solve all evils of the world, or that the kernel should be rewritten. But a programming language *can* solve silly things like buffer overflows (well, most of them) or format string vulnerabilities.<br>
And let's not mention the fact that you didn't name even *one* argument why Rust wouldn't be a viable competitor. Especially when considering that I was talking about Rust 1.0 that isn't even released yet...<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If you think that writing a kernel in a different language is the right thing to do, go write it, and if you are correct and it is superior, you will displace Linux</font><br>
So you're essentially saying that the success of a kernel is determined solely by the programming language it's implemented in? Because otherwise your point doesn't make any sense at all.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Linus has said many times that he expects that eventually there will be some other kernel written that will replace Linux.</font><br>
I don't think Linus is right about that. Linux is "too big to fail" by now, it's not going to be replaced. The best that one could hope for is an incremental solution to the C problem by allowing, say, some new drivers for non-critical hardware to be written in another language, and then gradually expand from there.<br>

The only ambiguity here is what "it" refers to. It could be either the newly written kernel or the Rust programming language. However, with the phrase "if you are correct" he clearly refers to some statement I made earlier, and I never said anything about some hypothetical new kernel, so he must be talking about the Rust language. So I'm sorry, but what he was saying just rubbish; he probably meant something else but it's hard to tell...<br>

The whole point of using a memory-safe language like Rust in the kernel is *not* having to bother with a Microkernel architecture.<br>

Another anti-patterns which seems to have changed behaviour with newer GCC, at least on ARM:<br>
<p>
void fct (const char *str)<br>
{<br>
    char *ptr = strchr (str, ':');<br>
    if (ptr != 0)  *ptr = '\0';<br>
    ... do something with str which is declared const ...<br>

Well, I don't see how this was guaranteed to work anyways. If `str` points to ro memory, you're hosed anyways. The C standard should fix these const -&gt; non const issues at some point (as C++11/C++14 is finally doing). Is there a `strlchr` function floating around somewhere?<br>

<p>What you mean by that? Even C++98 requires std::strchr() and similar functions to be overloaded so that the return type matches the pointer argument type. I don't know how that could be achieved in C.</p>

Well, the ideal fix's first step is "acquire time machine", but other than that, there's not much to be done other than something like a flag day (which I don't see happening any time soon), or adding overloading to C (somehow…), or CDR (C Done "Right") (which would never take off due to the incompatibilities).<br>
<p>
If you're replying to the C++ side of things, it's most in reference to the fact that lots of container methods are now accepting const_iterator instead of iterator (such as erase() and insert()) so that you don't have to "infect" non-const-ness around to other places (or const_cast).<br>

      <p>Embedded C++ is very strange creature because it removes one of the most important advantages of C++: namespaces. Thing like a namespace is more-or-less required to manage large programs and Embedded C++ forced the same fourty years old substitute (prefixes and/or suffixes).</p>

<p>Frankly I don't see a point. It's not really compatible with C++, but it's not compatible with C either. It includes not usable rounded-up set features but bunch of easily implementable features instead. In short: it's something designed to brag about, not something designed with real work in mind. <b>Very</b> similar to LSB: both in idea and in implementation. Only LSB has slowly started to acquire useful features recently, while EC++ just died.</p>

Embedded C++ is a pathetic idiocy that remove tons of useful functionality without any reason and doesn't solve any of the real problems that C and C++ have.

I think it's more referencing the fact that there *are* lots of eyeballs on the code and there are *still* plenty of problems. That he can go in and find problems left and right isn't good even if he is fixing them; there's only so much time in a day.<br>

The mathematical "enough" is a very, very abstract thing. "For a sufficiently large N" works for math, but it does not work for the real world.<br>
<p>
"Given enough effort we can solve world hunger, ensure world peace and prosperity for all".<br>
<p>
So, yeah, that doesn't prove anything, methinks.<br>

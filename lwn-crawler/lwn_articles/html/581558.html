<a href="/Articles/576276/">LWN's guide to Btrfs</a>
</div>
At this point, LWN's series on the Btrfs filesystem has covered most of the
aspects of working with this next-generation filesystem.  This article, the
final installment in the series, will deal with a few loose ends that did
not fit into the previous articles; in particular, we'll look at the
send/receive functionality and a subset of the available <tt>ioctl()</tt>
commands that are specific to Btrfs.  In both cases, functionality is
exposed that is not available in most other Linux filesystems.
<p>
<h4>Send and receive</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/579009/">subvolumes and snapshots article</a>
described a rudimentary scheme for making incremental backups to a Btrfs
filesystem.  It was simple enough:
use <tt>rsync</tt> to make the backup filesystem look like the original,
then take a snapshot of the backup to preserve the state of affairs at that
particular time.  This approach is relatively efficient; <tt>rsync</tt>
will only copy changes to the filesystem (passing over unchanged files),
and each snapshot will preserve those changes without copying unchanged
data on the backup volume.  In this way, quite a bit of filesystem history
can be kept in a readily accessible form.
<p>
There is another way to do incremental backups, though,
if both the original and backup filesystems are Btrfs filesystems.  In that
case, the Btrfs send/receive mechanism can be used to optimize the process.

One starts by taking a snapshot of the original filesystem:
<p>
<pre>
    btrfs subvolume snapshot -r <i>source-subvolume</i> <i>snapshot-name</i>
</pre>
<p>
The <i><tt>snapshot-name</tt></i> should probably include a timestamp,
since the whole mechanism depends on the existence of regular snapshots at
each incremental backup time.  The initial snapshot is then copied to the
backup drive with a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    cd <i>backup-filesystem</i>
    btrfs send <i>path-to-snapshot</i> | btrfs receive .
</pre>
<p>
This operation, which will copy the entire snapshot, can take quite a
while, especially if the source filesystem 
is large.  It is, indeed, significantly slower than just populating the
destination filesystem with <tt>rsync</tt> or a pair of <tt>tar</tt>
commands.  It <i>might</i> work to use one of the latter methods to
populate the backup filesystem initially, but using the send/receive chain
ensures that things are set up the way those commands expect them to be.
<p>
Note that if the source snapshot is not read-only, <tt>btrfs send</tt> will
refuse to work with it.  There appears to be no <tt>btrfs</tt> command to
set the read-only flag on an existing snapshot that was created as
writable, but it is, of course, a simple matter to create a new read-only
snapshot of an existing read/write snapshot, should the need arise.
<p>
Once the initial copy of the filesystem is in place, incremental backups
can be done by taking a new snapshot on the source filesystem, then running
a command like: 
<p>
<pre>
    cd <i>backup-filesystem</i>
    btrfs send -p <i>path-to-previous-snapshot</i> <i>path-to-new-snapshot</i> | btrfs receive .
</pre>
<p>
With the <tt>-p</tt> flag, <tt>btrfs send</tt> will only send files (or
portions thereof) that have changed since the
<tt><i>previous-snapshot</i></tt> was taken; note that the previous
snapshot needs to exist on the backup filesystem as well.  Unlike the initial copy,
an incremental <tt>send</tt> operation is quite fast â€” much faster than
using a command like <tt>rsync</tt> to find and send changed files.  It can
thus be used as a low-impact incremental backup mechanism, possibly running
many times each day.
<p>
Full use of this feature, naturally, is likely to require some scripting
work.  For example, it may not be desirable to keep every snapshot on the
original filesystem, especially if space is tight there.  But it is
necessary to keep each snapshot long enough to use it for the next
incremental <tt>send</tt> operation; using the starting snapshot would
result in the unnecessary copying of a lot of data.  Over time, one
assumes, reasonably user-friendly tools will be developed to automate these
tasks. 
<p>
<h4>Btrfs ioctl() commands</h4>
<p>
Like most of the relatively complex Linux filesystems, Btrfs supports a
number of filesystem-specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands.
These commands are, as a rule, entirely undocumented; one must go to the
(nearly comment-free) source to discover them and understand what they do.
This article will not take the place of a proper document, but it will try
to point out a few of the more interesting commands.
<p>
Most of the Btrfs-specific commands carry out operations that are available
via the <tt>btrfs</tt> command-line tool.  Thus, there are commands for the
management of subvolumes and snapshots, devices, etc.  For the most part,
the <tt>btrfs</tt> tool is the best way to access this type of
functionality, so those commands will not be covered here.  It is amusing
to note that several of these commands already come in multiple versions;
the first version lacked a field (usually flags to modify the operation)
that was added in the second version.
<p>
The structures and constants for all Btrfs <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands should
be found in <tt>&lt;linux/btrfs.h&gt;</tt>; some distributions may require
the installation of a development package to get that header.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Cloning files</b>.
The Btrfs copy-on-write (COW) mechanism can be used to make copies of files
that share the underlying storage, but which still behave like separate
files.  A file that has been "cloned" in this way behaves like a hard link
as long as neither the original file nor the copy is modified; once a change is made, the COW
mechanism copies the modified blocks, causing the two files to diverge.
Cloning an entire file is a simple matter of calling:
<p>
<pre>
    status = ioctl(dest, BTRFS_IOC_CLONE, src);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>dest</tt> and <tt>src</tt> are open file descriptors indicating
the two files to operate on; <tt>dest</tt> must be opened for write
access.  Both files must be in the same Btrfs filesystem.  
<p>
To clone a
portion of a file's contents, one starts with one of these structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct btrfs_ioctl_clone_range_args {
  	__s64 src_fd;
  	__u64 src_offset, src_length;
  	__u64 dest_offset;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The structure is then passed as the argument to the
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command:
<p>
<pre>
    status = ioctl(dest, BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE, &amp;args);
</pre>
<p>
As with
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_CLONE</tt>, the destination file descriptor is passed as the
first parameter to <tt>ioctl()</tt>.  
<p>
Note that the clone functionality is
also available in reasonably modern Linux systems using the
<tt>--reflink</tt> option to the <tt>cp</tt> command.
<p>
<li> <b>Explicit flushing</b>.
As with any other filesystem, Btrfs will flush dirty data to permanent
storage in response to the <tt>fsync()</tt> or <tt>fdatasync()</tt> system
calls.  It is also possible to start a synchronization operation explicitly
with:
<p>
<pre>
    u64 transid;

    status = ioctl(fd, BTRFS_IOC_START_SYNC, &amp;transid);
</pre>
<p>
This call will start flushing data on the filesystem containing
<tt>fd</tt>, but will not wait for that operation to complete.  The
optional <tt>transid</tt> argument will be set to an internal transaction
ID corresponding to the requested flush operation.  Should the need arise
to wait until the flush is complete, that can be done with:
<p>
<pre>
    status = ioctl(fd, BTRFS_IOC_WAIT_SYNC, &amp;transid);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>transid</tt> should be the value returned from the
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_START_SYNC</tt> call.  If <tt>transid</tt> is a null pointer,
the call will block until the current transaction, whatever it is,
completes.
<p>
<li> <b>Transaction control</b>.
The flush operations can be used by an application that wants to ensure
that one transaction completes before starting something new.  Programmers
who want to live dangerously, though, can use the
<tt>BTRFS_IOC_TRANS_START</tt> and <tt>BTRFS_IOC_TRANS_END</tt> commands
(which take no arguments) to explicitly begin and end transactions within
the filesystem.  All filesystem operations made between the two calls will
become visible to other processes in an atomic manner; partially completed
transactions will not be seen.
<p>
The transaction feature seems useful, but one should heed well this comment
from <tt>fs/btrfs/ioctl.c</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    /*
     * there are many ways the trans_start and trans_end ioctls can lead
     * to deadlocks.  They should only be used by applications that
     * basically own the machine, and have a very in depth understanding
     * of all the possible deadlocks and enospc problems.
     */
</pre>
<p>
Most application developers, one might imagine, lack this "very in depth
understanding" of how things can go wrong within Btrfs.  Additionally,
there seems to be no way to abort a transaction; so, for example, if an
application crashes in the middle of a transaction, the transaction will be
ended by the kernel and the work done up to the
crash will become visible in the filesystem.  So, for most developers
considering using this functionality, the right answer at this point is
almost certainly "don't do that."  Anybody who wants to try anyway will
need the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability to do so.
</ul>
<p>
There are quite a few more <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands supported by Btrfs,
but, as mentioned above, most of them are probably more conveniently
accessed by way of the <tt>btrfs</tt> tool.  For the curious, the available
commands can be found at the bottom of <tt>fs/btrfs/ioctl.c</tt> in the
kernel source tree.
<p>
<h4>Series conclusion</h4>
<p>
At this point, LWN's series on the Btrfs filesystem concludes.  The major
functionality offered by this filesystem, including device management,
subvolumes, snapshots, send/receive and more, has been covered in the five
articles that make up this set.  While several developers have ideas for
other interesting features to add to the filesystem,
chances are that most of that feature work will not go into the mainline
kernel anytime soon; the focus, at this point, is on the creation of a
stable and 
high-performance filesystem.
<p>
There are few knowledgeable developers who would claim that Btrfs is fully
ready for production work at this time, so that stabilization and
performance work is likely to go on for a while.  That said, increasing
numbers of users are putting Btrfs to work on at least a trial basis, and
things are getting more solid.  Predictions of this type are always hard to
make successfully, but it seems that, within a year or two, Btrfs will be
accepted as a production-quality filesystem for an increasingly wide range
of use cases.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I saw "transactions" and thought "yay! finally filesystem level transactions", until I read on and found that "abort" is not available, which kind of defeats the whole purpose.<br>
<p>
True filesystem transactions would solve lots of race conditions:<br>
<p>
Want a temporary file no-one else can see? Start a transaction, use your temporary file, then when you're done abort the transaction. Completely secure.<br>
<p>
Replace a file atomically? Wrap the delete and rename in a transaction. No longer does the kernel need to guess what you want the filesystem to look like if there's a crash.<br>
<p>
Package installations can become atomic.<br>
<p>
I hope someday this world can come to pass.<br>

I've written a utility as a user-friendly way to use btrfs send and receive for backups or other synchronization, and I'd love to get feedback on it.<br>
<p>
As of this release, buttersink will synchronize a set of read-only snapshots in a btrfs filesystem to an Amazon S3 bucket, and vice-versa.  It<br>
intelligently picks parent snapshots to "diff" from, so that a minimal amount of data needs to be sent over the wire and stored in the backend.<br>
<p>
It's both on GitHub (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/AmesCornish/buttersink">https://github.com/AmesCornish/buttersink</a>) and PyPi (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buttersink/">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buttersink/</a>).<br>

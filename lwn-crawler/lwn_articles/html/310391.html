It has been just over four years, now, since <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/106010/">the realtime discussion got
serious</a> and the realtime preemption patch set got its start.  During
that time, your editor has heard many predictions for when the bulk of the
realtime work would be merged; generally, the guess has been "within about
a year."  While a lot of realtime work <i>has</i> been merged, some of the
core components of the realtime tree remain outside of the mainline.
Beyond that, the realtime developers have been relatively quiet over the
last year - at least on the realtime front.  Having taken on some little
side tasks - unifying the x86 architecture and maintaining it going
forward, for example 
- some of those developers have been just a little bit distracted recently.
<p>

The realtime patch set has not gone away, though.  If nothing else, the
fact that a number of distributors are shipping this code is enough to
ensure continued interest in its development.  So your editor noted with
interest the recent <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/310368/">announcement
of a new -rt tree</a> with an updated set of realtime patches.  This tree
will be of interest for anybody wanting to look at the realtime work in the
context of the 2.6.28 kernel or beyond.
<p>

One of the core technologies in the realtime tree is a change to how
spinlocks work.  Spinlocks in the mainline will busy-wait until the
required lock becomes available; they thus occupy the processor to no
useful end when acquiring a contended lock.  Holding a spinlock will also
prevent a thread from being preempted.  This behavior is generally best for
system throughput; it also makes it easier to write correct code.  But
anything which prevents a CPU from immediately servicing the
highest-priority process runs counter to the chief design goal of a
realtime operating system: providing deterministic response times in all
situations.  So, for the realtime patches, classic spinlocks had to go.
<p>

The solution was to turn most spinlocks into a form of mutex with priority
inheritance.  A process which attempts to acquire a contended "spinlock"
will no longer spin; instead, it goes to sleep and waits for the lock to
become free, making the processor available to another thread.  Code which
holds one of these non-spinlocks is no longer immune to preemption; a
higher-priority thread can always push it out of the way.  By changing
spinlocks in this way, the realtime hackers were able to eliminate one of
the largest sources of latency in the mainline kernel.
Much of that work found its way into the mainline some time ago in the form
of the mutex API, but spinlocks themselves have not been changed in the
mainline.  
<p>

To minimize the pain of maintaining the realtime patches, the
developers simply redefined the <tt>spinlock_t</tt> type to be the new
mutex type instead.  Except that, as it turns out, some spinlocks in
low-level parts of the kernel really do need to be spinlocks still.  So
those were switched to a new <tt>raw_spinlock_t</tt> type - but without
changing the various <tt>spin_lock()</tt> calls.  Instead, some truly
frightening macro trickery was introduced to cause the spinlock API to do
the right thing when passed either of two entirely different mutual
exclusion primitives.  This bit of macro magic was always going to be an
impediment to mainline inclusion, so the realtime developers never really
expected to merge the lock code in that form.
<p>
The new realtime tree now shows how the realtime developers think this work
might get into the mainline.  It involves a more explicit separation of the
two types of "spinlocks" - and a lot of code churn.  In the realtime tree,
most locks of type <tt>spinlock_t</tt> are changed to a new <tt>lock_t</tt>
type.  There is a new set of operations for this type:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/lock.h&gt;

    lock_t lock;

    acquire_lock(&amp;lock);
    release_lock(&amp;lock);
</pre>
<p>

For a normal, non-realtime kernel build, <tt>lock_t</tt> will be the same
as <tt>spinlock_t</tt>, and things will work as they always have.  On
realtime kernels, instead, <tt>lock_t</tt> will be a mutex type.  The other
variants of the spinlock API will be represented in the new API (there is
an <tt>acquire_lock_irqsave()</tt>, for example), but none of them will
actually disable interrupts in a realtime kernel.  Meanwhile,
<tt>spinlock_t</tt> will remain a true spinlock type.
<p>
This change gets rid of the tricky macros, but at the cost of changing the
declarations of and operations on almost all spinlocks in the kernel.  That
is a lot of code changes: a quick grep turns up over 20,000
<tt>spin_lock*()</tt> calls in the upcoming 2.6.28 kernel.  That will make
for some pain if and when this change is merged.  But in the mean time, it
can only make for a <i>lot</i> of pain for the people who have to maintain
this patch out of tree.  To make their lives a little easier, the realtime
developers have created a couple of scripts to do the bulk of the work.
First, all spinlocks in a pristine kernel are converted to <tt>lock_t</tt>,
then the few locks which truly must be spinlocks are switched back.  This
work is kept in a separate branch which is regenerated when needed; in this
way, the realtime developers avoid the need to do nasty merges to keep up
with current kernels.
<p>

Your editor has heard talk of another locking change which does not, yet,
appear in this tree.  One problem with the realtime patch set is that it
requires distributors to create yet another kernel build - something they
hate doing - if they want to
support realtime operation.  
In an effort to make life easier for distributors, the
realtime developers are working on a scheme whereby a kernel would
determine at run time whether it should be running in a realtime mode.  If
so, spinlocks will be changed to sleeping locks by patching the kernel
binary as it boots.  Kernels built this way will be able to run efficiently
in either mode.
<p>

The branches of the realtime tree provide a quick guide to the other parts
of the realtime work which remain outside of the mainline.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/302043/">threaded interrupt handler</a> code
is one example; that change could be proposed (again) for merging in the
near future.  The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/243920/">priority
workqueue</a> mechanism sits in another branch, as do patches aimed at Java
support, filesystem changes, memory management changes, and more.  Then,
there's a branch for stuff which will never be merged; for example, there
is <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-rt.git;a=commitdiff;h=54db6a0c8b2cc7b07ad46cb6b533484b913306f6;hp=721d5dfe7e516954c501d5e9d0dfab379cf4241a">this
patch</a> which gives Java programs direct access to physical memory - not
something which strikes most kernel developers as a good idea.  All told,
there is a great deal of work sitting in the realtime patch set; this work
is finally being organized into a proper git tree.
<p>

The "upstream first" policy says that vendors should merge their code
upstream before shipping it to customers.  The 2.6.x development model is
built on the idea that no change is too fundamental to be accepted into a
regular, 3-month development cycle.  The realtime patches would appear to be
an exception to both rules.  It has taken over four years to get to a point
where some of the fundamental realtime technologies are close to ready for the mainline,
but distributors have been shipping it for at least three of those years.
It has, in other words, been one of the biggest forks of the Linux kernel,
ever.  The plan has always been to join this fork back with the mainline,
though; perhaps, finally, that goal is getting closer.  With luck, it will
happen within about a year.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>The header that is used is still <i>spinlock.h</i>. The <i>lock.h</i> is included by spinlock.h. Currently, if you include <i>lock.h</i> directly, you will get a compile time error.

<p>
This may change in the future when we actually start pushing it towards mainline. But as it stands, <i>spinlock.h</i> should still be used.

Can somebody explain how threaded interrupt handlers differ from simply using a work queue? I also looked at <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/302043/">http://lwn.net/Articles/302043/</a> but I am no closer to an answer.<br>
<p>
In my understanding "threaded interrupt handlers" are simply minimal top halves who wake up a dedicated thread to do teh work of the bottom half (without the usual restrictions). Can't that already be done on a case by case basis in the mainline without a new API?<br>

Yes it can be done today with the current code, but that will put a heck of a lot of code in each driver that wants to do it. It would need to create its own thread and have its top half only disable the device, and wake up that thread. Then this thread would be in a loop waiting to service the interrupt.<br>
<p>
Then each driver would probably do this in its own little way. Having an new API for something that would have lots of users and prevent code duplication is a good thing. But that is just for the threaded interrupt per devices.<br>
<p>
The RT tree does a big ax approach. All device handlers become threads without the device even knowing that it is happening. In this case, the threads are at the IRQ layer. That is, if you have two devices sharing the same IRQ, they will also share the same thread.  This allows the RT tree to preempt any device interrupt handler when it needs to. And with this change, most spin locks can simply be a mutex. That is the reason for the new lock API.<br>

Thanks!<br>
<p>
I have a further question about shared IRQs in the RT tree. When saying that devices sharing an IRQ also share a thread, do you mean only the top halves, or all of the processing?<br>
<p>
If it is the latter, isn't that a serious limitation? After all tasklets from devices sharing an IRQ can run simultaneously on different CPUs.<br>

Only the top half is shared. The soft irqs and tasklets also run as a thread, but there is a softirq thread for each softirq and per CPU. That is, if you have 8 CPUS, you will see 8 sirq-netrx threads, one per ever CPU.<br>
<p>
Each softirq has its own thread. This lets you prioritize the softirqs as well, where you can not do that with vanilla linux. You can raise the network softirqs over the other softirqs.<br>

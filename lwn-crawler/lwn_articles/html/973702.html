<h1>An update and future plans for DAMON</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 17, 2024</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/mm/damon/index.html">DAMON</a>
subsystem was the subject of the first session in the memory-management
track at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  DAMON
maintainer SeongJae Park introduced the data-access monitoring
framework, which can generate snapshots of how memory is accessed, enabling
the detection of hot and cold regions of memory in both the virtual and
physical address spaces.  The session covered recent changes and future
plans for this tool.
<p>
While DAMON can acquire memory-usage information, DAMOS extends DAMON by
enabling the specification of policies to take action on that information.
It can, for example, be instructed to force out any page of memory that has
not been accessed in the last five seconds.  Recent work on DAMOS includes
the addition of a quota feature to control how aggressively it works; it
can be used to limit the amount of memory processed in a given time period.
There is also a new filter mechanism to better focus its efforts; for
example, DAMOS can be directed at specific NUMA nodes, or to only work on
file-backed pages.
<p>

DAMOS is seeing increased use, Park said.  A number of products are using
it now for proactive reclaim, and there is interest in using it for <a
href="/Articles/894598/">Compute Express Link (CXL)</a> 
memory management.  DAMOS has also been picked up by researchers, leading
to some 20 citations in the literature.
<p>
At <a href="/Articles/931769/">a 2023 LSFMM+BPF session</a>, Park was told
that better documentation for DAMON would be appreciated; that
documentation has since been written and merged.  That session also
concluded that keeping the DAMON user-space tools in the kernel tree would
not be a good idea.  Part of the motivation for raising that idea had been
to generate better test coverage.  Park is now working on adding that to
kselftest instead.

<p>
Another improvement is pseudo moving-sum-based fast snapshots.  By default,
DAMON produces snapshots over a period of 100ms.  In 6.7, it gained the
ability to create "reasonable snapshots" over shorter sampling intervals,
5ms by default.  That is useful when the user wants to aggregate data over
longer intervals, but would like to be able to get shorter-term data as
well.
<p>
There are some new filter types.  Aggregation can now be filtered on
address ranges, and narrowed to NUMA nodes, memory zones, or virtual-memory
areas.  DAMON can also filter on the "page is young" flag, which can be
used to double-check the status of a page before acting on it.  The biggest
change, though, is "aim-ordering, feedback-driven, aggressive auto-tuning".
It allows the DAMOS quota to be automatically adjusted with a feedback
loop.  The user can provide the quota value, based on a parameter such as
workload latency, or the kernel can drive it using existing system metrics,
such as targeting a given <a href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall</a>
rate.
<p>
<h4>What's next</h4>
<p>
Looking to the future, the first objective is control of tiered-memory
management with automatic tuning; this is an area that is being explored
now.  The initial objective will be two-tier promotion and demotion; some
patches are available now.  The algorithm, roughly, is proposed to
eventually work like this:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> If a node has a lower (slower) node available to it, then demote
     cold pages to that lower node, keeping the amount of free memory above
     a minimum threshold.
<li> If the node has an upper (faster) node, then push hot pages up to
     the upper node, trying to keep the utilization rate on that node high.
</ul>
<p>
The objective here is to maximize the utilization of memory on the faster
nodes, while keeping pages that are accessed less frequently in slower
memory.  The algorithm aims for a slow but continuous movement of pages
between nodes, and will be extendable to systems with more memory tiers.
<p>
Another objective is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240512193657.79298-1-sj@kernel.org/">"access/contiguity-aware
memory auto scaling"</a> or ACMA.  The model here is that the user will
specify the minimum and maximum memory requirements for their workload; a
service provider will then run the workload somewhere, aiming for both good
performance and low cost.  Optimizing this scenario in current kernels
requires the orchestration by the provider of four kernel features:
memory overcommit, reporting more reclaimable pages with DAMON,
periodic compaction, and memory hotplug to set hard limits and to minimize
the <tt>page</tt> structure overhead.
<p>
Systems using these techniques have been working well in real-world
deployments for years, Park said.  But, he added, it is also a rather
complex solution.  Relying on memory hotplug is both slow and prone to
failure — there are many ways to block the hot-removal of memory.
System-level memory compaction is wasteful, especially in the absence of
access information.  Users can access pages at any time, thwarting the
system's efforts to better organize memory.  As a result, non-collaborative
control of guests is difficult or impossible.
<p>
Park proposed an alternative for allocation of memory to guests based on
two core actions.  <tt>damos_alloc</tt> will allocate a memory region
with a minimum level of contiguity, then inform the user about that
allocation; <tt>damos_free</tt>  returns memory to the system, also
maintaining minimum levels of contiguity.  These actions are driven by the
system's current pressure-stall level.  Memory is allocated to keep the
stall level below an acceptable maximum, while freeing happens to keep that
level above a minimum threshold.  Since notifications are provided for
memory changes, collaborative guests can react accordingly; ballooning can
be used to control non-collaborative guests.
<p>
The objective is to limit the complexity involved in making such a system
work; there are just three parameters to adjust.  Since ACMA scales memory
in 2MB chunks, it maintains the contiguity of memory on the host, even
under high memory pressure.  This system could also be extended to support
the <a href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous memory allocator</a> or for
power management by powering down memory banks when they are not needed.
<p>
Michal Hocko pointed out that the kernel should be providing mechanisms
rather than policy, and asked how user space would control this feature.
Park answered that control is currently managed through the DAMON sysfs
interface, but the plan is to create simpler modules with fewer knobs to
adjust.  Hocko said that he was concerned about creating long-term API
issues; developers are still trying to figure out what the best interfaces
should be for the control of memory tiering, and it is important to be
careful about which interfaces we commit to.  "Sysfs is terrible", he continued;
it allows the addition of too many interfaces without sufficient review.
There needs to be more consideration of the API before this work can be
merged.
<p>
Dan Williams asked whether there was a path to migrate DAMON-based features
to more formal kernel interfaces.  DAMON is a good way to do "science
experiments", he said, but perhaps there should be a promotion path into
the core kernel for the experiments that succeed.  David Hildenbrand
expressed worries about interference with the core memory-management code,
and said that it was important that DAMON doesn't start taking on too much
work.  As the session ran out of time, Park said that he is trying to keep
DAMON simple and to avoid that kind of interference.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 4, 2016</br>
           </div>
The kernel's random-number generator (RNG) has seen <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#Random_numbers">a great deal of 
attention</a> over the years; that is appropriate, given that its proper
functioning is vital to the security of the system as a whole.  During that
time, it has acquitted itself well.  That said, there are some concerns
about the RNG going forward that have led to various patches aimed at
improving both randomness and performance.  Now there are two patch sets
that significantly change the RNG's operation to consider.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/685468/">The first of these</a> comes from Stephan
Müller, who has two independent sets of concerns that he is trying to
address:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The randomness (entropy) in the RNG, in the end, comes from sources of
     physical entropy in the outside world.  In practice, that means the
     timing of disk-drive operations, human-input events, and interrupts in
     general.  But the solid-state drives deployed in current systems are
     far more predictable than rotating drives, many systems are deployed
     in settings where there are no human-input events at all, and, in any
     case, the entropy gained from those events duplicates the entropy from
     interrupts in general.  The end result, Stephan fears, is that the
     current RNG is unable to pick up enough entropy to be truly random,
     especially early in the bootstrap process.
<p>
<li> The RNG has shown some scalability problems on large NUMA systems,
     especially when faced with workloads that consume large amounts of
     random data from the kernel.  There have been <a
     href="/Articles/660452/">various attempts</a> to improve RNG
     scalability over the last year, but none have been merged to this
     point.
</ul>
<p>
Stephan tries to address both problems by throwing out much of the current
RNG and replacing it with "a new approach"; see <a
href="http://www.chronox.de/lrng/doc/lrng.xhtml">this page</a> for a highly
detailed explanation of the goals and implementation of this patch set.  It
starts by trying 
to increase the amount of useful entropy that can be obtained from the
environment, and from interrupt timing in particular.  The current RNG
assumes that the timing of a specific interrupt carries little entropy —
less than one bit.  Stephan's patch, instead, accounts a full bit of
entropy from each interrupt.  Thus, in a sense, this is an accounting
change: there is no more entropy flowing into the system than before, but
it is being recognized at a higher rate, allowing early-boot users of
random data to proceed.
<p>
Other sources of entropy are used as well when they are available; these
include a hardware RNG attached to the system or built into the CPU itself
(though little entropy is credited for the latter source).  Earlier
versions of the patch used the <a href="/Articles/642166/">CPU jitter
RNG</a> (also implemented by Stephan) as another source of entropy, but that was
removed at the <a href="/Articles/686048/">request</a> of RNG maintainer
Ted Ts'o, who is not convinced that differences in execution time are a
trustworthy source of entropy.
<p>
The hope is that interrupt timings, when added to whatever other sources of
entropy are available, will be sufficient to quickly fill the entropy pool
and allow the generation of truly random numbers.  As with current systems,
data read from <tt>/dev/random</tt> will remove entropy directly from that
pool and will not complete until sufficient entropy accumulates there to
satisfy the request.  The actual random numbers are generated by running
data from the entropy pool through the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A">SP800-90A</a>
deterministic random bit generator (DRBG).
<p>
For <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>, another SP800-90A DRBG is fed from the primary DRBG
described above and used to generate pseudo-random data.  Every so often
(ten minutes at the outset), this secondary generator is reseeded from the
primary.  On NUMA systems, there is one secondary generator for each node,
keeping the random-data generation node-local and increasing scalability.
<p>
There has been a certain amount of discussion of Stephan's proposal, which
is now in its third iteration, but Ted has said little 
beyond questioning the use of the CPU jitter technique.  Or, at
least, that was true until May&nbsp;2, when he posted <a
href="/Articles/685737/">a new RNG of his own</a>.  Ted's work takes some
clear inspiration from Stephan's patches (and from Andi Kleen's scalability
work from last year) but it is, nonetheless, a different approach.
<p>
Ted's patch, too, gets rid of the separate entropy pool for
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>; this time, though, it is replaced by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant">ChaCha20 stream
cipher</a> seeded from the random pool.  ChaCha20 is deemed to be secure
and, it is thought, will perform better than SP800-9A.  There is one
ChaCha20 instance for each NUMA node, again, hopefully, helping to improve
the scalability of the RNG (though Ted <a href="/Articles/686050/">makes it
clear</a> that he sees this effort as being beyond the call of duty).
There is no longer any attempt to track the amount of entropy stored in the
(no-longer-existing) <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> pool, but each ChaCha20 instance
is reseeded every five minutes.
<p>
When the system is booting, the new RNG will credit each interrupt's timing
data with one bit of entropy, as does Stephan's RNG.  Once the RNG is
initialized with sufficient entropy, though, the RNG switches to the
current system, which accounts far less entropy for each interrupt.  This
policy reflects Ted's unease with assuming that there is much entropy in
interrupt timings; the timing of interrupts might be more predictable than
one might think, especially on virtualized systems with no direct
connection to real hardware.
<p>
Stephan's <a href="/Articles/686052/">response</a> to this posting has been
gracious: "<q>In general, I have no concerns with this approach
either. And thank you that some of my concerns are addressed.</q>"
That, along with the fact that Ted is the ultimate decision-maker in this
case, suggests that his patch set is the one that is more likely to make it
into the mainline; it probably will not come down to flipping a coin.  It
would be most surprising to see that merging happen for 4.7 
— something as sensitive as the RNG needs some review and testing time —
but it could happen not too long thereafter.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

So /dev/random and /dev/urandom will be the same, like it is in *BSDs and Mac OS X? And /dev/random will not have entropy estimation anymore? This seems to be much more similar that is used in other systems, and AFAIK seems to be as secure (with the nice benefit of not having "black magic" in the kernel RNG).<br>

A I understand it, urandom will never block, it will just give you the best randomness it can.<br>
<p>
remember that even if the official estimate of the entropy in the pool is 1 bit, the pool has had a lot of odds and ends stuffed into it. The official estimate is deliberately low, so by the time userspace is invoked, there going to be enough data there to initialize the stream cipher. The only question is how pure it is.<br>

Phew. I was panicking for a moment at the loss of entropy estimation, but in fact there is still something in there: more particularly, writing is still pollable, so things like ekey-egd-linux which rely on being woken up when more randomness is needed, but don't want to be spraying it into an idle system constantly, will still work.<br>

Entropy estimation is still used for the input pool and the /dev/random pool.<br>
<p>
The entropy estimation was being done for the non-blocking (/dev/urandom) pool before, but we weren't really doing anything with it, and in particular we were rate-limiting the amount we would draw down from the input pool if the non-blocking pool was getting aggressively drained.  (And if you are running the Chrome browser, it was getting drained extremely aggressively because the Chrome browser was using /dev/urandom for everything, including session keys for https connections --- it wasn't using its own per-process CRNG.)   So the entropy accounting for /dev/urandom was largely pointless which is why effectively we have been gradually transitioning /dev/urandom into something which is more and more a CRNG.   The most recent patch is just the final step in a gradual evolution.<br>

That seems completely sensible. Using /dev/urandom for everything is usually silly because it's fairly slow, but for something with a focus on paranoia and heavy network-exposure like Chrome, you can see why they did it (it's not as if /dev/urandom is going to be anything like as slow as doing anything with the network, and if the kernel's RNG is broken, Chrome is screwed anyway, so this reduces their vulnerability surface at no performance or reliability cost). It's a bit of a shame on code-complexity grounds that blocking and nonblocking RNGs need such different codebases, but it does make sense: they have very different use cases, or should do if you're using them for the right things.<br>

Why is it silly?<br>
<p>
/dev/urandom works and is easy to use. It's also secure - you can't easily dump its state by attaching to a process with ptrace or gleam it from core dumps.<br>

That's not a particularly compelling argument, since if you can grab state from the browser, there are way more catastrophic secrets that can be leaked besides the RNG state --- for example, long-lived OAUTH tokens....<br>

If a process is being ptraced, /dev/urandom adds little security wrt that process: the process's entire operation is being spied on, so the ability to predict *future* RNG outputs is not often important next to the ability to see precisely what output the process is actually using.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; When the system is booting, the new RNG will credit each interrupt's timing data with one bit of entropy, as does Stephan's RNG. Once the RNG is initialized with sufficient entropy, though, the RNG switches to the current system, which accounts far less entropy for each interrupt.</font><br>

Is there any evidence for the amounts credited?<br>

My immediate impression is to expect interrupts during boot to be *less* random rather than more,<br>

Most likely, yes. But the system is likely to be more (unless it has a Hardware-RNG) entropy-starved on boot than during normal operation.<br>

But boot is also when the system is more likely to generate keys automatically than any other time, no, where low-quality entropy being used to seed CPRNGs could have long-term security-impacting bad effects?<br>

Exactly.<br>
<p>
If 1 bit / interrupt is a good enough estimate for boot-time entropy, it ought to be good enough for later.<br>
If it is not, then we should not pretend to have enough entropy when we do not.<br>

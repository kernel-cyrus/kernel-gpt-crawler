<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 31, 2024</br>
           </div>
The "pidfdfs" virtual filesystem was added to the 6.9 kernel release as a
way to export better information about running processes to user space.  It
replaced a previous implementation in a way that was, on its surface, fully
compatible while adding a number of new capabilities.  This transition,
which was intended to be entirely invisible to existing applications,
already <a href="/Articles/963749/">ran into trouble</a> in March, when a
misunderstanding with SELinux caused systems with pidfdfs to fail to boot
properly.  That problem was quickly fixed, but it turns out that there was
one more surprise in store, showing just how hard ABI compatibility can be
at times.
<p>
A pidfd is a file descriptor that identifies a running process.  Within the
kernel, it must have all of the data structures that normally go along with
file descriptors so that kernel subsystems know what to do with it.  The
kernel has, since the 2.6.22 release in 2007, had a small helper mechanism
providing anonymous inodes to back up file descriptors on virtual
filesystems that do not have a real file behind them.  When the <a
href="/Articles/773459/">pidfd abstraction</a> was added to the 5.1 kernel,
it was naturally implemented using anonymous inodes, and all worked as
intended.
<p>
Eventually, though, the limitations of this implementation began to make
themselves felt.  In response, Christian Brauner reworked the
implementation away from anonymous inodes, creating the separate pidfdfs
filesystem.  The new filesystem supported the use of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
on a pidfd; that, in turn, made real inode numbers available to user space
that could be used to compare two pidfds for equality.  Added functionality
(such as killing a process when the last pidfd referring to it is closed)
became possible.  The new implementation also gave security modules a say
in pidfd operations; this was the source of the first set of problems but,
in the longer term, will help administrators with the control of their
system.
<p>
Once the security-module problem was worked out, it seemed like the pidfdfs
problems had been taken care of.  But then, Jiri Slaby <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/210098f9-1e71-48c9-be08-7e8074ec33c1@kernel.org">reported</a>
that kernels with pidfdfs broke both the <a
href="https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux">util-linux</a> test suite
and the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsof.8.html"><tt>lsof</tt></a>
utility.  Brauner <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240515-anklopfen-ausgleichen-0d7c220b16f4@brauner">answered</a>
that the util-linux problem had been fixed upstream, but that <tt>lsof</tt>
was a surprise.

It turns out that there were two problems in need of solving, one rather
more predictable than the other.
<p>
In pre-6.9 systems, "<tt>ls&nbsp;-l</tt>"
or <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lstat.2.html"><tt>lstat()</tt></a>
would show a pidfd as a symbolic link to the string
"<tt>anon_inode:[pidfd]</tt>".  As of 6.9, instead, the result would be
"<tt>pidfd:[<i>inode</i>]</tt>", showing the inode number assigned to the
pidfd.  Since <tt>lsof</tt> was looking for the pre-6.9 version of the
string, it failed to recognize or do the right thing with pidfds.
<p>
But, it turns out, there is more.  When the anonymous-inode code was added,
the author never bothered (or simply forgot) to set the file-type field in
each inode as it was created.  As a result, system calls like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html"><tt>stat()</tt></a>
will report the file type as zero, which is not actually a defined file
type.  That would cause command-line tools like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stat.1.html"><tt>stat</tt></a>
to describe the result as type as "<q>weird file</q>", which was
objectively true.  This little quirk never created trouble for any tools
that actually worked with files backed by anonymous inodes, so it never was
fixed.
<p>
It was noticed, though.
Somebody working on <tt>lsof</tt> cleverly realized that a file
type of zero was a convenient way to recognize anonymous-inode files.  So
<tt>lsof</tt> acquired a test for that condition, taking advantage of an
ABI quirk that was never intended, much less documented.  Once a
<tt>stat()</tt> call on a pidfd started returning a proper file type,
<tt>lsof</tt> no longer recognized the file and got hopelessly confused.
Linus Torvalds <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=whMVsvYD4-OZx20ZR6zkOPoeMckxETxtqeJP2AAhd=Lcg@mail.gmail.com">was
unimpressed</a> when all of this became clear:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	What a crock. That's horrible, and we apparently never noticed how
	broken anon_inodes were because nobody really cared. But then lsof
	seems to have done the *opposite* and just said (for unfathomable
	reasons) "this can't be a normal regular file".
</blockquote>
<p>
That said, he also allowed that "<q>we probably just have to live in the
bed we made</q>"; breaking <tt>lsof</tt> was a user-space regression in
need of fixing.
<p>
Brauner put together a patch that was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/db3d841ac9ed">merged</a> prior to the
6.10-rc1 release; it has not yet found its way into the 6.9 stable updates.
The patch restored the older output format for pidfds and caused the
file-type field to be explicitly masked to zero, restoring the previous
behavior.  With that fix, <tt>lsof</tt> works again, and people are mostly
happy.
<p>
When he <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20240521-girlanden-zehnfach-1bff7eb9218c@brauner">sent
the patch</a>, though, Brauner said that he "<q>would like to try to move
away from the current insanity</q>" in the near future.  He hopes that
<tt>lsof</tt> will be fixed to be able to handle the newer output format,
and that it will be possible to remove this compatibility hack.  Torvalds
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wgt2W6jmfCc9FPB+WC09Cqo4YTmwyAeCQq6Mxkx3EjACQ@mail.gmail.com">seems
willing to try</a>, but he pointed out that some users (and their
distributions) can be quite slow to update their user-space tools, so it
may be a long time before this change is no longer needed.
<p>
In summary: <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's law</a> has shown
its applicability yet again.  Leaving zero in the type field was never
meant to be a part of the ABI for anonymous inodes; it is just a bug, an
artifact of a job that was not completely done.  But, since that behavior
was visible, code came to depend on it, and the bug can no longer be fixed.
This episode is another hint that kernel interfaces could benefit from a
higher level of scrutiny than they typically get before showing up in a
released kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It would probably have helped if the lsof author in question would have *asked* whether the zeroed file type is intentional.<br>

If they had, presumably the stat() bug would have been fixed five years ago.<br>

That invention is, I believe, called "Design Documentation". Two things the linux development process seems woefully short of.<br>
<p>
And one of the things that Lennart regularly gets slagged off for - most things he's involved with have a well thought out design before any code gets cut.<br>

Design docs are great but they don't help you spot missed details like "didn't mean to set file type to zero".<br>
<p>
The only real thing that helps here is more systematic tests. Write down all the invariants you can possibly think of, including "file type must be valid". Create a test harness that creates all possible types of files in all the different filesystems. Test the cross product before every kernel release, at least.<br>
<p>
You can still forget to add a test for some invariant that later turns out to be important. Mutation testing and test coverage help with that. You can never completely solve this but certainly you can do a lot better than the kernel is currently doing. The good news is that this kind of testing work parallelizes well (although fixing the bugs you find doesn't).<br>

<p>
Good design docs do.<br>
<p>
I bang on about truth tables, but if your design doc says "this is the set of possible filetypes, this is the set of valid filetypes, this is the set of invalid filetypes", it *should* stand out like a sore thumb if you fail to define file type 0. A good design doc should at least enumerate all logical possibilities - even if as I bang on it just says "I haven't covered this area". That way you know if your (re)definition is going to step on someone else's toes :-)<br>

But presumably in this case the design doc would say "0 is not a valid file type". Which might have helped userspace avoid assuming it was intentional, but doesn't help the kernel side -- the problem here AIUI wasn't that the design was unclear, it was a straightforward code bug where it didn't follow the intended design.<br>

Yes (a) it would have told userspace it was breaking the rules, but ...<br>
<p>
Why didn't the kernel follow the design? Because there was no design to follow? So it wasn't actually a bug because nobody thought things through?<br>
<p>
The mere existence of a thought-through design massively reduces the chances of things like this being missed.<br>
<p>
Not really the same (but it is) in lilypond they had a function that created a rehearsal mark - could be a letter or a number - and put it in a wrapper - could be none, circle or box. There was a random mix of possibilities, and I was forever tripping over stuff I couldn't do. So I proposed something as stupid as "why not do a cross-product of all available marks in all available wrappers?". Some kind soul did, and there's never been a problem since.<br>
<p>
Sadly, it's been my *regular* experience that that sort of lack of thought is the *norm*. And it would pre-empt SOOOO many problems.<br>

I think the kernel didn't follow the design because this detail of it (which is probably mandated by posix) interacts unfortunately with the C language, which lets you forget to initialize a struct field and get zero, and won't insist that you fill it with a valid value for the type, because everything's just an integer.<br>

But there was a spec -- it's posix, which says anything you stat should have a filetype and defines what they are. Having a spec that says "this field must be valid" manifestly didn't avoid the bug.<br>

I think it's in large part because the spec (POSIX) is so out of touch with the reality (what Linux actually implements) that POSIX compliance is a distant second thought at best (and is entirely ignored and left to the userspace, i.e. libc, at worst).<br>
<p>
In either case, POSIX does not really seem to inform either development or validation of Linux syscalls. It is not a design document for Linux.<br>

SUS demands that st_mode shall have a meaningful value for defined file types which are block devices, character devices, FIFOs, regular files, symlinks and sockets. It doesn't define numerical values for such meaningful file type information, only macros. <br>

"design docs" have many permutations. Specifically, I would like to see every kernel API be rejected as a patch unless the patch includes *detailed* documentation, in whatever form the kernel is using for man pages now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the manpages project is an after-the-fact catch up process.<br>
<p>
If  there were standard doc formats for file systems, so that `man pidfdfs` had to return a man page with information such as file type, whether it supports symlinks, what their string format is, etc, etc it would help a lot in reviewing code, and help in reminding authors of the full range of things they need to be considering.<br>
<p>
As is, a lot of "code review" has only code patches and email threads. Reviewing code that doesn't have a description of what its supposed to do, and why, is a bit hard. Its also hard for potential consumers of the new APIs. If man pages are provided, many more people can look at the new API being proposed and give feedback before the API becomes and immutable ABI. As is, reviewers have to be familiar enough with kernel code to read the implementation, AND at the same time be a potential user. That's cutting lots of valuable possible review out.<br>
<p>
As I recall early Linux, we didn't need docs so much, because much of early Linux wasn't novel. It was supposed to work like other unix-ish systems did, so when reviewing code, that's what we had to look for; does this work the same, does it work with already existing userspace BSD or GNU tools. As we have more and more system that are Linux specific, I don't think we've caught up to requiring docs for code submissions.<br>

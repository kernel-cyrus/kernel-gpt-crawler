<p>
Hardening the kernel to make attackers' jobs harder was the topic of a
wide-ranging discussion at the Linux Security Summit (LSS) held on
September&nbsp;8, 2011.
Reducing the attack surface of the kernel, protecting it from user-space
attacks,  and finding ways to mitigate
entire classes of exploitable bugs were all on the table.  As might be
expected, the biggest barrier to getting these hardening patches accepted into
the mainline is often performance concerns.  While no firm
conclusions were drawn, many ideas were discussed, some of which may
eventually find their way into the mainline.

</p>

<h4>Attack surface</h4>

<p>
The discussion began with an effort to quantify the "<q>exposed
surface</q>" of the kernel as roundtable leader Will Drewry of Google's
Chrome OS team put it.  He
and the other roundtable leader, Kees Cook of the Ubuntu security team, put
together their own list, but also asked those present to add to it. Obvious
attack surfaces like the system call interface, <tt>/proc</tt> and sysfs
files, the networking stack, and device drivers were mentioned, but also
less obvious things like filesystem parsing, auto-loaded kernel modules,
device scanning, CPU or other hardware bugs, side-channel timing attacks,
and so on. 
</p>

<p>
Enumerating the attack surface "<q>helps define what to pay attention
to</q>", Cook said.  The intent of many of the kernel hardening patches
is to try "<q>to kill off a whole class of problems, rather than
shooting individual bugs</q>", he said.  The latter is where most of the
current kernel security effort goes, he said.  Drewry added that the intent
is to figure out what can be done now to reduce those attack surfaces.
Many of the attack surfaces are still present even in a system that runs a
mandatory access control (MAC) system like SELinux, Cook said, because the
system call interface is still available to be used (and abused).  That is
one of the problems with looking to the LSM interface to provide
confinement, he added.
</p>

<p>
Casey Schaufler also pointed out that there is often special-purpose
hardware in Linux systems&mdash;in years past it was graphics hardware, but
these 
days tends to be video hardware&mdash;that is allowed to be directly
accessed from user 
space. That opens up a number of potential security problems, he said, but
that won't stop it from happening.  The capabilities provided by allowing
direct access to these devices are "<q>so compelling that security
concerns are secondary</q>". 
</p>

<p>
But there are kernel installations that are more security-sensitive, Cook
said, that could benefit from restricting some features even at the cost of
performance. If a particular hardening feature has no real cost, it could
be put into the kernel without providing a configuration option to disable
it.  Others, that do have a cost, could be optional and distributions or
users could enable them based on their needs.
</p>

<h4>API/ABI restrictions</h4>

<p>
The "<q>biggest single exposure</q>" in Linux systems is applications
that run as root, Schaufler said, like the X server.  Because the kernel is
one "<q>gigantic privileged application</q>" it can't be protected
against other privileged applications like X, Cook said.  But,
applications could have the ABI available to them reduced, Drewry said,
which would reduce the damage they could do if they are compromised.
</p>

<p>
The only existing "<q>API management</q>" tool in the kernel (besides
the LSM interface) is <a href="/Articles/332974/">seccomp</a>, but it is
too restrictive to be useful for many applications, Drewry said.  Since
seccomp only allows four system calls (<tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>exit()</tt>, and
<tt>sigreturn()</tt>), it is too limited for many possible reduced-ABI
applications. The Chrome/Chromium browser team would like to be able to
reduce the system calls that its rendering processes can make. Seccomp
is too limited for Chromium's needs, so they have implemented a more
complicated <a 
href="/Articles/347547/">solution</a>, with a "trusted" assembly language
thread that mediates system calls. System call restrictions could also be
enforced using <tt>ptrace()</tt>, Drewry said, but there is an
"<q>intense amount of overhead</q>".
</p>

<p>
What Drewry is looking for is some kind of <a
href="/Articles/441232/">expanded seccomp</a> where a subset of system
calls would be allowed. So far, his patches to implement that have been
shot down from various directions, but there is hope that there may be some
kind of resolution at the upcoming Kernel Summit.
</p>

<p>
Some of the attendees were skeptical of an expanded seccomp approach.
Schaufler pointed out that there is already a mechanism in the kernel
(capabilities) for
reducing the impact of vulnerabilities, but "<q>no one
uses it</q>".  Cook was not convinced that the granularity of
capabilities was really all that useful because the number of <a href="/Articles/421671/">capability
bits that are equivalent to root</a> is so large.
</p>

<p>
As Drewry cast about for a way to limit system calls, there was discussion
of possibly augmenting the LSM interface.  As Cook pointed out, the current
interface does not mediate all system calls, so it can't be used for
Drewry's use case as it stands.  James Morris noted that LSM is intended to
be an access control framework and not anything more than that.  In the
end, Drewry doesn't particularly care how to get there, he is just looking
for a way for "<q>reducing what I expose to untrusted
applications</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler also pointed out that reducing the ABI available to an
application doesn't help "<q>if the ABI is completely well-defined and
if it is consistent with the security policy</q>" of the
system. "<q>That's a lot of 'if's</q>", Drewry responded, to
general agreement, that neither of the two conditions are met
on Linux systems. Because the system call interface is not well-defined,
nor necessarily consistent with the system security policy, reducing the
exposure of parts of that interface can help.  Schaufler cautioned that the
<i>ad hoc</i> documentation makes it hard to decide where the bugs actually
are: "<q>If the code is the documentation, it is impossible to have a
bug</q>". 
</p>

<p>
There were questions about whether seccomp filtering (in whatever form) would
actually be used by applications.  Cook noted that, in addition to Chromium,
several other projects popped up on linux-kernel to express interest in the
feature, including QEMU, vsftpd, and others.  One attendee also
hypothesized a DNS server that was limited to <tt>recvmsg()</tt>,
<tt>sendmsg()</tt>, and <tt>write()</tt> (to a log file) as another
possible use-case.
</p>

<p>
There were also concerns that seccomp filters would spread security policy
throughout the system, but others saw that as a feature.  Unlike MAC
policy, which tends to be imposed from the outside, seccomp filter policy would
embody "<q>the programmer's idea of what it should be able to
do</q>", as Cook put it.  While the system call granularity may not be
exactly right, it is the place where user space enters the kernel, so
mediating at that point makes some sense.
</p>

<p>
Attendees theorized that if a flexible seccomp filter facility was
available, multiple applications would take advantage of it.  Smalley was a
bit skeptical that it would be straightforward for most applications to use
the facility because it might require a major rework of the program.  He
pointed to the privilege separation efforts that went on in OpenSSH as an
example.  That required "<q>significant refactoring</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
Drewry said that the Chromium team's plan is to move the browser to
whatever solution becomes available to better contain the renderers.  Right
now, that is the "trusted thread" sandbox, but if there are other
facilities available, Chromium will use them.  That could be some kind of
SELinux containment, seccomp filtering, or something else entirely.  In the
future, the team would also like to confine renderers based on where the
data comes from, he said, so that all renderers running for a given site
were protected from each other as well.
</p>

<h4>PaX and grsecurity</h4>

<p>
The roundtable wrapped up with some discussion of bringing more of the <a
href="http://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity and PaX</a> hardening patches into
the mainline.  Those patches tend to be fairly intrusive and have
performance implications that make them undesirable to many kernel hackers,
but they do provide protections that some would find valuable.  According
to Cook, there are many pieces of grsecurity and PaX that could make their
way into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Simple things, like <tt>const</tt>ifying function pointers, are essentially
free and should be mainlined immediately: "<q>It's a shame that hasn't
been done long ago</q>", one attendee said.  Others that have more
impact are trickier.  Making them optional is one possibility, but even
that has a cost that maintainers are likely to push back against.  Adding
another path through core kernel code can be a maintenance headache, and
those may be difficult to get into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
Andre Hedrick mentioned that he has been pulling apart the grsecurity/PaX
patches to try to make them more palatable.  For one thing, grsecurity
depends on a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism that isn't present
in the mainline (and isn't implemented as an LSM, so it isn't likely to
ever be, at least in that form).  Hedrick is trying to remove that
dependency from the grsecurity 
features of interest, like better address-space layout randomization (ASLR)
and a fully relocatable kernel, both of which can thwart various kinds of
attacks. 
</p>

<p>
One goal would be to find the grsecurity/PaX changes that have minimal
impact and to get those into the mainline as non-optional protections.
Turning RBAC into an LSM might be another useful exercise.  grsecurity
developer Brad Spengler provided a "<q>long list</q>" of features
that could make their way into the kernel at last year's LSS, Cook said.
That list would make a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
Cook also noted several other efforts aimed at hardening the kernel.  Those
include the <a href="/Articles/451405/">work</a> that Openwall hacker
Vasiliy Kulikov has been doing, much of which is being discussed on the <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/">kernel-hardening
mailing list</a>.  Also, the Ubuntu security team has been working on <a
href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening">a kernel
hardening project</a> of its own. There is no lack of ideas out there, and a clear need to
make the kernel more resistant to attacks.  Based on the discussion, and
the various ongoing efforts, we are likely to see more and more hardening
patches aimed at the mainline over the next few years.

Great article.<br>
I was wondering the GRSecurity/PAX stuff has been around for ages. What are the reasons some of the good parts didn't end up in the kernel? Are the devs(on both sides) hard to work with? Did it take kernel.org and linux.com to go down to open maintainers eyes for security? Did everybody think complex stuff like SELinux would be the sufficient?<br>

Is the sun hot?

The kernel developers do not get on very well with pseudonymous developers who believe they already know everything and whose response to any criticisms or suggestions at all is imputations of malice. Actually, the latter is sufficient: see the kernel list's stellar record of cooperation with Joerg Schilling. (Or, for that matter, anyone at all's record of cooperation with Joerg Schilling.)

Might be worth mentioning that FreeBSD already provides an "extended seccomp"; it's called Capsicum.  In a talk (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raNx9L4VH2k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raNx9L4VH2k</a>) there is a nice table comparing the number of lines of code that it took to properly sandobox Chromium using different mechanisms - with Linux and seccomp, it was 11300 lines of code and it was still incomplete; with FreeBSD and Capsicum, it was 100 lines.<br>

      A capability-based model like Capsicum's would indeed be very nice to have for Linux, for many reasons:
<ul>
<li>It would give a much more useful environment than a stark read()/write()/_exit() isolation cell
<li>It is based on sound reasoning that is easy to understand (principle of least authority, zero ambient authority)
<li>It would force a healthy review of all the different namespaces in Linux, making us ask ourselves "is this really needed?", and useful ways of converting them into honest file descriptors
<li>Properly done, it would practically give process containers for free
<li>The Capsicum project itself has demonstrated feasibility and we roughly know what to expect from their experience, both in terms of implementation and use
</ul>
Last time I looked, Capsicum hadn't really addressed resource limitations; this might be necessary in the long run, but is probably not stricly necessary for a first useful attempt.

This looks nice as a propaganda which is typical for bsd fanboys. I'd like to know how many lines of code freebsd needs to implement SELinux? Entire Linux kernel?<br>

Not sure why would anyone want to reimplement those, but regarding SELinux - FreeBSD already implements several Mandatory Access Control policies.  Differently from Linux, they are stackable.  This framework is also used by several commercial operating systems, including MacOS X.<br>

Thanks for the very interesting write up.  However I'm confused by the conversation at several points and I'm not sure if I'm being dense, something was lost in the writeup, or if the participants were saying confusing things and sometimes talking past each other :)<br>
<p>
<p>
1) "Because the kernel is one "gigantic privileged application" it can't be protected against other privileged applications like X, Cook said."<br>
<p>
Umm... would this be any better if the kernel were not privileged?  It seems like the problem is that X is a gigantic privileged application and/or that the kernel requires it to be privileged at all.  Or is there a point I'm missing?<br>
<p>
<p>
2) 'Some of the attendees were skeptical of an expanded seccomp approach. Schaufler pointed out that there is already a mechanism in the kernel (capabilities) for reducing the impact of vulnerabilities, but "no one uses it". Cook was not convinced that the granularity of capabilities was really all that useful because the number of capability bits that are equivalent to root is so large.'<br>
<p>
Well yes, capabilities exist, but they don't really work.  The reason Cook gave is true, but misses the much larger failure: they only remove capabilities that are normally exclusive to root.  Hopefully people aren't making Chrome setuid root.<br>
<p>
<p>
3) "If the code is the documentation, it is impossible to have a bug"<br>
<p>
Documentation is good, and important if you want people to code to your intent and not the implementation.  However the statement isn't completely fair.  Things like stack-smashes, double-frees, and dereferencing of bad pointers would be widely recognized as bugs even for code that doesn't have documentation to say it doesn't crash your system :)<br>
<p>
<p>
4) "In the future, the team would also like to confine renderers based on where the data comes from, he said, so that all renderers running for a given site were protected from each other as well."<br>
<p>
Is there something preventing this now?  There's something strange about the sentence: I would almost think that it should be s/a given site/different sites/, but I think that already happens.  Wouldn't renderers for the same site would seem to have data coming from the same place at least as much as renderers for different sites would?<br>

<p>
That sentence would make sense if one displayed site embedded something from a different security domain ( e.g. example.com embeds from google.com while you are authenticated by a cookie with google.com ; a whole site by iframe or an picture by img src ). The data comes from different domains and is displayed in one site but still needs to be protected from each other.<br>

<p>
And even for root operations they seem to have too little granularity.<br>
<p>
Ptrace capability is a good (worst?) example of this.  You need it to read things like process maps &amp; smaps files which many (resource usage measurement) tools need, but that capability allows also attaching, inspecting and changing other users process internals, not just inspect how many mappings they have and how much memory those mappings use.  Also, instead of denying access to maps &amp; smaps /proc files, lacking ptrace capability means that you get wrong (empty) content for those files...<br>

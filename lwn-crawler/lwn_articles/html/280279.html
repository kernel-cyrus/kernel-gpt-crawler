<p>
Linux capabilities have had a long and somewhat tortuous journey as part of
the Linux kernel.  Slowly&mdash;and very carefully&mdash;functionality is
being added to this security feature to get it to a point where it is a
viable alternative to the all-or-nothing <tt>setuid(0)</tt> model.  A
recently merged <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3898b1b4ebff8dcfbcf1807e0661585e06c9a91c">patch</a>
adds a per-process securebits feature that will allow capabilities-based
daemons or subsystems to coexist with existing <tt>setuid</tt> utilities.
</p>

<p>
Linux capabilities break up the privileged tasks
normally associated with root (i.e. uid 0) into finer-grained abilities
which can be individually granted or revoked for specific processes.  The
idea is to change the standard Unix model that root has all special
privileges while all other users have none.  
The terminology is always a bit contentious, though, as Linux capabilities are
derived from a POSIX proposal that was never adopted, but shares the name
"capabilities" with an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">entirely
different approach</a>; this article is only concerned with capabilities of
the Linux variety.
</p>

<p>
There has long been interest in creating a Linux system that did not rely upon
a single root account.  Capabilities are seen as the way to
get there, but they have suffered from a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.
With the recent work to add <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/211883/">file-based
capabilities</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/256519/">restore
<tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> to its original meaning</a>, a true
capabilities-based system is becoming possible.  In the patch, which has
been merged for 2.6.26, Andrew Morgan describes the new functionality:
<div class="BigQuote">
The feature added by this patch can be leveraged to suppress the privilege
associated with (set)uid-0.  This suppression requires CAP_SETPCAP to
initiate, and only immediately affects the 'current' process (it is inherited
through fork()/exec()).  This reimplementation differs significantly from the
historical support for securebits which was system-wide, unwieldy and which
has ultimately withered to a dead relic in the source of the modern kernel.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The patch removes the global securebits variable, replacing it with an
entry in <tt>struct task_struct</tt>, that can be manipulated by a process,
but only for itself&mdash;and any children.  Morgan envisions hybrid
systems that have 
some utilities using capabilities to get their privileges along with some
<tt>setuid(0)</tt> utilities.  In that scenario, a capabilities-based
utility or daemon may wish to limit what its children can do, even if they execute a
<tt>setuid(0)</tt> binary.  As part of the evolution, process trees can be
created that cannot get root privileges.
</p>

<p>
Processes which have the <tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> capability can change their securebits setting
via the <tt>prctl()</tt> system call.  There are three separate bits that
govern the interaction of capabilities and <tt>setuid</tt>:
<ul>
<li><tt>SECURE_NOROOT</tt> &ndash; enabling this gives no special privileges to uid
0</li>
<li><tt>SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</tt> &ndash; setting this bit disables capability
fixes when transitioning from or to uid 0 via <tt>setuid</tt>.  This might be
done for compatibility with older programs that use <tt>setuid</tt> to
reduce their privileges.</li>
<li><tt>SECURE_KEEP_CAPS</tt> &ndash; when set, a process can retain its
capabilities even when transitioning to a normal (not uid 0) user.  This
bit is cleared by <tt>exec()</tt>.</li>
</ul>
Each of these bits also has a companion <tt>*_LOCKED</tt> bit that, if set,
will not 
allow any user program to alter the corresponding setting. 
As Morgan notes in the patch, a program that can set its capabilities (has
<tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt>) can drop all privileges for itself and any child
process by doing:
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS, 0x2f);
</pre>
This is the equivalent of setting <tt>SECURE_NOROOT</tt>, <tt>SECURE_NO_ROOT_LOCKED</tt>,
<tt>SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</tt>, <tt>SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED</tt>, and
<tt>SECURE_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
The memory of the sendmail-capabilities bug from 2000 makes some
a bit queasy&mdash;or worse&mdash;about any patches that involve
capabilities and <tt>setuid</tt>.  Andrew
Morton <a href="/Articles/280386/">asks</a>: "<q>what was the bug which
caused us to cripple capability inheritance back in the days of yore? (Some
sendmail thing?)</q>" 
That bug was caused because unprivileged users could take away the
<tt>CAP_SETUID</tt> capability from <tt>setuid</tt> binaries like
sendmail.  When sendmail then used <tt>setuid</tt> to drop its privileges,
it failed, but sendmail did not check, so it was still running with full
privilege.  This could be leveraged by a user to gain root privileges. It
was a disconnect between capabilities and 
the longstanding behavior of Unix-like systems when dropping privileges.
</p>

<p>
Morgan has written a
<a
href="http://userweb.kernel.org/~morgan/sendmail-capabilities-war-story.html">detailed
description of the sendmail-capabilities bug</a> in response to Morton's
questions.  He makes it clear that he wants to move toward full capability
support without breaking existing code:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'm basically interested in evolving the capability implementation
back to the POSIX.1e model and making it whole - but most certainly
*without crippling legacy superuser support in the process* .
<p>
As folk get more comfortable with this full capability model. I
believe we can delete more cruft from the main kernel, but even that
clean up will leave a fully functional legacy model in place. I feel
it should be for something like init, or one of its children to be
able to run subsystems in capability-only or legacy modes.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Morton seemed satisfied that his concerns had been addressed, but still
<a href="/Articles/280388/">wonders about the future for capabilities</a>: "<q>So how do we ever get to the stage where we can recommend that distributors
turn these things on, and have them agree with us?</q>"  This was <a
href="/Articles/280389/">echoed by Ismail D&ouml;nmez</a>, who was looking
for concrete examples of how to use the per-process securebits feature.
Morgan provides a pointer to some examples along with his belief that
sometime soon the capabilities developers will become confident enough to
recommend turning off the "experimental" flag for the
<tt>SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES</tt> kernel configuration.  That flag
governs both the file-based capabilities as well as the per-process
securebits.  In addition, Morgan <a href="/Articles/280390/">says</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
More importantly I'm hopeful that in that time we'll have accumulated
enough documentation and user-space experience and examples to convince
others that this is, indeed, a viable feature to support in mainstream
distributions.
</div>
</p>

<p>
A <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-posixcap.html">developerWorks
article on file-based capabilities</a> by Serge Hallyn and a <a
href="http://www.friedhoff.org/posixfilecaps.html">web page on POSIX
capabilities</a> by Chris Friedhoff were both mentioned in the thread as
good references for the work being done to actually <i>use</i> capabilities
in systems.  Those pre-date the securebits work, so D&ouml;nmez was looking
for use-cases for the new feature.  Morgan replied that containers were
one, deferring to Hallyn who <a href="/Articles/280410/">has some ideas on
using securebits</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
We tend to talk about 'system containers' versus 'application
containers'. A system container would be like a vserver or openvz
instance, something which looks like a separate machine. I was
going to say I don't imagine per-process securebits being useful
there, but actually since a system container doesn't need to do any
hardware setup it actually might be a much easier start for a full
SECURE_NOROOT distro than a real machine. Heck, on a real machine init
and a few legacy [daemons] could run in the init namespace, while users
log in and apache etc run in a SECURE_NOROOT container.
<p>
But I especially like the thought of for instance postfix running in a
carefully crafted application container (with its own virtual network
card and limited file tree and no visibility of other processes) with
SECURE_NOROOT on.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Capabilities are an interesting, but complicated, security feature.  For
most of the ten years they have been part of the Linux kernel, they have
either been broken, ignored, or both.  With the latest work being done by
Hallyn, Morgan, and others, capabilities are finally becoming a fully-working
alternative to things like SELinux.  It will be interesting to see if
more user utilities will become capability-aware and whether distributions
start using capabilities.  Some day, root may just fade away.

I'd love to be able to create a process that had root's ability to READ all files, but lacked
root's ability to WRITE all files.  This would eliminate the need to run remote backup jobs as
root, which has always worried me.

I'm not sure if there is an other way already, but having a process just bind a port below
1024 without being root while doing so would be really nice as well.

</blockquote>
<p>
That's been there since the earliest days of capabilities.  It is the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability.  Whenever I have a program that wants superuser privilege just so it can bind a reserved port, I invoke it from a program "capexec", which sets NET_BIND_SERVICE capability only, sets the proper uid and gid, and execs the untrusted program.  (The process is superuser when it invokes capexec).
<p>
Sometimes I have to modify the untrusted program because it contains a bogus check for uid zero.
<p>
But an even better way to deal with this is not to give any privilege to the untrusted program at all -- just pass it a file descriptor for a socket already bound to the reserved port.  For that, I use "socketexec" before "capexec".  Socketexec creates the socket and execs capexec.  Capexec drops <em>all</em> privileges and execs the untrusted program.  I usually have to modify the program to be able to take an already bound socket.  Some programs have to bind multiple times in their life and this won't work.

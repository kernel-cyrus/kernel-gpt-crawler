           </div>
Among the many changes merged for 5.13 can be found performance
improvements throughout the kernel.  This work does not always stand out
the way that new features do, but it is vitally important for the future of
the kernel overall.  In the memory-management area, a couple of
long-running patch sets have finally made it into the mainline; these
provide a bulk page-allocation interface and
huge-page mappings in the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> area.
Both of these changes should make things faster, at least for some
workloads. 
<p>
<h4>Batch page allocation</h4>
<p>
The kernel's memory-allocation functions have long been optimized for
performance and scalability, but there are situations where that work still
has not achieved the desired results.  One of those is high-speed
networking.  Back in 2016, networking developer Jesper Dangaard Brouer <a
href="/Articles/684616/">described the challenges</a> that come with the
fastest network links; when the system is processing tens of millions of
packets per second, the time available to deal with any given packet is
highly constrained.  The kernel may only have a few hundred CPU cycles
available to process each packet, and obtaining a page from the memory
allocator may, by itself, require more than that.  Using the entire
CPU-time budget to allocate memory is not the way to get the best network
performance. 
<p>
At the time, Brouer asked for an API that would allow numerous pages to be
allocated with a single call, hopefully with a much lower per-page cost.
The networking code could then grab a pile 
of memory, and quickly hand out pages as needed.  Nobody objected to the
request at the time; it is well understood that batching operations can
increase throughput in situations like this.  But it took some time for
that interface to come around.
<p>
Mel Gorman took on that task and put together a patch series, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210325114228.27719-1-mgorman@techsingularity.net/">the
sixth version of which</a> was posted and taken into the -mm tree in
March.  It adds two new interfaces for the allocation of single ("order-0")
pages, starting with:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long alloc_pages_bulk(gfp_t gfp, unsigned long nr_pages,
    				   struct list_head *list);
</pre>
<p>
The allocation flags to use are stored in <tt>gfp</tt>, <tt>nr_pages</tt>
is the number of pages the caller would like to allocate, and <tt>list</tt>
is a list onto which the allocated pages are to be put.  The return value
will be the number of pages actually allocated, which could be less than
<tt>nr_pages</tt> for any of a number of reasons.  The <tt>page</tt>
structures for the allocated pages are assembled into a list (using the
<tt>lru</tt> entry) and attached to the provided <tt>list</tt>.
<p>
Returning the pages in a linked list may seem a little strange, especially
since "linked lists" and "scalability" tend not to go together well.
The advantage of this approach is that it does not require allocating any
memory to track the allocated pages.  Since the list is unlikely to be
traversed (there is never a need to walk through the list as a whole), the
scalability issues do not apply here.  Still, this interface 
may seem awkward to some.  For those who would rather supply an array to be
filled with pointers, a different interface is available:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned long alloc_pages_bulk_array(gfp_t gfp, unsigned long nr_pages,
    					 struct page **page_array);
</pre>
<p>
This function will store pointers to the <tt>page</tt> structures for the
allocated pages into <tt>page_array</tt>, which should really be at least
<tt>nr_pages</tt> elements long or unpleasant side effects may appear.
Interestingly, pages will only be allocated for NULL entries in
<tt>page_array</tt>, so <tt>alloc_pages_bulk_array()</tt> can be used to
refill a partially emptied array of pages.  This array, thus, must be
zeroed before the first call to <tt>alloc_pages_bulk_array()</tt>.
<p>
For users needing more control, the function under the hood that does the
work of both <tt>alloc_pages_bulk()</tt> and
<tt>alloc_pages_bulk_array()</tt> is:
<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int __alloc_pages_bulk(gfp_t gfp, int preferred_nid,
				    nodemask_t *nodemask, int nr_pages,
				    struct list_head *page_list,
				    struct page **page_array);
</pre>
<p>
The additional parameters control the location of the allocated pages on a
NUMA system; <tt>preferred_nid</tt> is the node to be used if possible,
while <tt>nodemask</tt>, if present, indicates the allowable set of nodes.
Exactly one of <tt>page_list</tt> and <tt>page_array</tt> should be
non-NULL and will be used to return the allocated pages.  If both are
supplied, <tt>page_array</tt> will be used and <tt>page_list</tt> will be
ignored.
<p>
Benchmarks included with the patch set show a nearly 13% speed increase for
the high-speed networking case, and something closer to 500% for a Sun RPC
test case.  Gorman noted, though, that: "<q>Both potential users in this
series are corner cases (NFS and high-speed networks) so it is unlikely
that most users will see any benefit in the short term.</q>"  The <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f6e70aab9dfe">Sun RPC</a> and <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/be5dba25b4b2">networking</a> uses have
gone directly into 5.13; others are likely to follow.
<p>
<a name="vmalloc"></a>
<h4>Huge-page vmalloc()</h4>
<p>
Most kernel memory-allocation functions return pointers to either pages or
addresses in the kernel's 
address map; either way, the addresses correspond to the physical address
of the memory that has been allocated.  That works well for small
allocations (one page or below), but physical memory allocations become
harder to satisfy as the size of the
allocation increases due to the fragmentation of memory over time.
For this reason, much
work has been done over the years to avoid the need for multi-page
allocations whenever possible.
<p>
Sometimes, though, only a large, contiguous region will do; the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> interface exists to serve that need.  The pages
allocated by <tt>vmalloc()</tt> will (probably) be scattered around
physical memory, but they will be made virtually contiguous by mapping them
into a special part of the kernel's address space.  Traditionally,
excessive use of <tt>vmalloc()</tt> was discouraged due to the costs of
setting up the mappings and the small size of the dedicated address space
on 32-bit systems.  The address-space limitation is not a problem on 64-bit
systems, though, and use of <tt>vmalloc()</tt> has been growing over time.
<p>
Addresses in the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> range are slower to use than addresses
in the kernel's direct mapping, though, because the latter are mapped using
huge pages whenever possible.  That reduces pressure on the CPU's
translation lookaside buffer (TLB), which is used to avoid resolving
virtual addresses through the page tables.  Mappings in the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> range use small ("base") pages, which are harder on the
TLB.
<p>
As of 5.13, though, <tt>vmalloc()</tt> can use huge pages for suitably
large allocations thanks to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/121e6f3258fe">this patch</a> from
Nicholas Piggin.  For <tt>vmalloc()</tt> allocations that are larger than
the smallest huge-page size, an attempt will be made to use huge pages
rather than base pages.  That can improve performance significantly for
some kernel data structures, as Piggin <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1616036421.amjz2efujj.astroid@bobo.none/">described</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Several of the most [used] structures in the kernel (e.g., vfs and
	network hash tables) are allocated with vmalloc on NUMA machines,
	in order to distribute access bandwidth over the machine. Mapping
	these with larger pages can improve TLB usage significantly, for
	example this reduces TLB misses by nearly 30x on a `git diff`
	workload on a 2-node POWER9 (59,800 -&gt; 2,100) and reduces CPU
	cycles by 0.54%, due to vfs hashes being allocated with 2MB pages.
</blockquote>
<p>
There are some potential disadvantages, including wasting larger amounts of
memory due to internal fragmentation; a 3MB allocation may be placed into
two 2MB huge pages, for example, leaving 1MB of unused memory at the end.
It is also possible that the distribution of memory across NUMA systems may
be less balanced when larger pages are used.  Some <tt>vmalloc()</tt>
callers may be unprepared for huge-page allocations, so they are not done
everywhere; in particular, the module loader, which uses <tt>vmalloc()</tt>
and could probably benefit from huge pages, does not currently use them.
<p>
Still, the advantages of using huge pages for <tt>vmalloc()</tt> would
appear to outweigh the disadvantages, at least in the testing that has been
done so far.  There is a new command-line parameter,
<tt>nohugevmalloc=</tt>, which can be used to disable this behavior if need
be.  
<p>
Most users are unlikely to notice any amazing speed improvements resulting
from these changes.  But they are an important part of the ongoing effort
to optimize the kernel's behavior wherever possible; a long list of changes
like this is the reason why Linux performs as well as it does.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmmm If I&#x27;&#x27;m not getting that backwards, shouldn&#x27;t it be only for &quot;NULL&quot; entries? (that way valid pointers aren&#x27;t lost)? That would seem to be consistent with the subsequent sentence that says the array needs to be zeroed.<br>

I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s supposed to be treated some what like a stack (you grab the next one in the list when ever you need a page).<br>

The &quot;list is unlikely to be traversed&quot; means that nobody is likely to need random access to list elements (just the first item on it).<br>

If I understand correctly, the list is embedded into struct page itself (one of its many packed fields). It means that if you want to do anything with the page you will need to load it into a cache line anyway, so there is (almost) no additional overhead.<br>
<p>
A similar idea is often used in userspace (and also in the kernel, I guess) which is a &quot;free list&quot;. You embed a list in the things you want to keep track of so that you can easily handle &quot;allocate a thing&quot; request by just returning a pointer to head (while you update the pointer using the embedded &quot;next&quot; pointer in the thing you just returned). This &quot;embedded list&quot; might be temporary - once you return the thing you can get rid of the list pointer, so you can easily handle same-sized memory chunks (at least sizeof(void*) long) without any overhead. And once you put the thing back on the list you reinstate the pointer and put it at the head.<br>
<p>
The only issue is when you need, say, 10 pages at the same time. The CPU will need to traverse a linked-list and load each struct page one after another. For the array variant, the CPU will still need to load each struct page but it can do so in parallel. However, I believe the use case here is to just ask for one page at a time. Heck, you can even try to prefetch the next struct page if you want to (though that is CPU-dependent).<br>

So this is only for order-0 pages?<br>
<p>
What happens if someone is trying to do 100 Gbps networking with jumbo packets of 9,000 bytes? Each packet would need an order-2 allocation of 4 pages.<br>
<p>
It is more likely the card is doing RDMA and not letting the kernel see packets at all. But if it was...<br>

Yes, it&#x27;s only for order-0 pages. Network cards have scatter-gather capabilities and will happily DMA a 9000 byte packet into three discontinuous pages.<br>
<p>
Networking people often try to do line rate with 64 byte packets. This is hard, hence the requests to the MM people to find ways to get memory more quickly.<br>

What do you mean? Double-underscore is a common convention within the kernel to denote a variant of a function that is generally not for common use.<br>

Probably referring to this:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/identifier#Reserved_identifiers">https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/identifier#Reser...</a><br>
<p>
The following identifiers are reserved and may not be declared in a program (doing so invokes undefined behavior): <br>
<p>
3) All identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter or by another underscore (these reserved identifiers allow the library to use numerous behind-the-scenes non-external macros and functions)<br>
<p>
---<br>
<p>
The kernel has been violating this rule for a long time.  It is more important in userspace though to avoid clashes with glibc internals.  I recall there was once a programming guide years ago (by Rusty Russell IIRC) that suggested using the kernel&#x27;s double-underscore convention in userspace, but it had to be updated once someone pointed out the above rule.  If there has been a recent push to get the kernel to follow the rule, I am not aware of it.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The kernel has been violating this rule for a long time</font><br>
<p>
IIRC the kernel interpretation has been that the underscore prefix is reserved _for the runtime implementation_ and compared to the average comfy userspace, the kernel _is_ the implementation rather than a hosted environment.<br>
<p>
Plus as mentioned above, they should be mostly local helpers, and it&#x27;s probably good to feel a bit dirty using an exported __symbol :)<br>

<p>
Why can the networking code hand out pages from a pile more quickly than system memory allocator code?

Because the pages are DMA-mapped to a specific PCI device. With an IOMMU, this can be an expensive operation.<br>

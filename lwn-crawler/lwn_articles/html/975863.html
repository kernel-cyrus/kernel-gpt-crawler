<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
The saga of the <tt>i_version</tt> field for inodes, which tracks the
occurrence of changes
to the data or metadata of a file, continued in a discussion at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  In a session led by
Jeff Layton, who has been doing a lot the work on <a
href="/Articles/905931/">changing the semantics and functioning of
<tt>i_version</tt></a> over the years, he updated attendees on the status of the <a
href="/Articles/946394/">effort</a> since a <a
href="/Articles/937247/">session at last year's summit</a>.  His summary
was that things are
"pretty much where we started last year", but the discussion this time
pointed to some possible ways forward.
</p>

<h4>Granularity</h4>

<p>
The problem is that the granularity of the timestamps used by Linux
(generally 1-10ms) is not sufficient to actually record all of the changes
that can happen to a file.  Multiple writes, for example, could all happen
within the same change time (ctime) value.  This becomes a problem for
NFSv2 and NFSv3
clients, which effectively use the ctime value to decide when to invalidate
their cached information; two different versions of a file with the same
ctime makes for a mess.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/976353/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/lsfmb-layton-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
width=204 height=280 alt="[Jeff Layton]" title="Jeff Layton">
</a>

<p>
NFSv4 added a "change attribute", which is a 64-bit value that is
guaranteed to change any time that the ctime would change (effectively), he
said; it 
does not get updated when the access time (atime) changes, because the
caches should not be invalidated when files are read.  NFSv4.2 added the
ability for the server to indicate what kind of change-attribute
information it is providing, which may allow clients to make better
caching decisions.  For example, if it is reported as monotonically
increasing, clients can ignore updates with lower values; only change
attributes that are higher than the value in the cache are valid at that point.
</p>

<p>
Most Linux filesystems track the change-attribute information as the
<tt>i_version</tt> of the file's inode.  But different filesystems handle
the attribute somewhat differently.  In particular, XFS has its own
attribute that does not follow the same semantics as the others—it
is incremented for atime updates.  So, if atime updates are turned on, the
client caches are invalidated incorrectly; even the <a
href="/Articles/244829/">relative-atime option</a> can cause some incorrect
cache invalidations.
</p>

<p>
In the past, XFS developers have been reluctant to add space in the on-disk
inode for a change attribute that works in the expected way.  He spoke with
Darrick Wong earlier in the day, though, and got the sense that perhaps
that reluctance might be diminishing.  Bcachefs still needs to implement
support for the attribute, but the space for it in the inode has been
reserved, Layton said.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that, on a write, the attribute value is typically
incremented (and the timestamps are updated) before copying the data to the
page cache.  A read that comes in between the updates and the copy will
associate the wrong state of the file with the data that is read.  That
problem can then persist for a long time in the client—until the file is
updated again.
</p>

<p>
Moving the updates after the copy still leaves a window for incorrect
information on the client, but it should resolve itself quickly.  Kent
Overstreet asked if the race condition can truly be eliminated.  Layton
said that moving the updates helps, but does not get rid of the race;
clients may have the new data associated with the old attribute value, but
they should get the new attribute value soon and invalidate their cache.
</p>

<p>
The change attributes are not stored on disk immediately, so server crashes
can lead to problems where different file states end up with the same
attribute values.  Amir Goldstein mentioned some patches he is working on
that will use <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable RCU</a> to protect the write operation, so that values can be
updated in memory, but will not be written to disk until the full operation
has completed.  Layton said that he would look to see if the patch set
could be used to help with this problem.
</p>

<p>
The crash-loss problem can be remedied by using the ctime value combined with the
change attribute, which means there can only be a problem if there is a
crash and a clock rollback on the server, "which is all pretty
unlikely". One thing that makes it hard to test these kinds of problems is
that the change attribute is not accessible from user space, so he would
like to expose it in some fashion.
</p>

<h4>Multi-grain</h4>

<p>
Last year, Dave Chinner had an idea for <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230424151104.175456-1-jlayton@kernel.org/">multi-grain timestamps</a> that was
implemented and, briefly, merged. It turned out that there was a problem where an
operation with a fine-grained timestamp and another with a coarse-grained
one could be seen as happening in the wrong order, Layton said.  That
breaks "some little-known tools like make and rsync", so the change was
backed out.  He thinks the problem could be fixed by using the fine-grained
timestamp as the floor for coarse-grained updates from that point on, but he got the impression
that Linus Torvalds and Christian Brauner were tired of him pushing it.  It
could be resurrected; Brauner pointed out that his objections were only
meant to apply to the merge window that was active at the time, so Layton
may pick that work back up.
</p>

<p>
Another alternative would be to use some "extra" low bits in the ctime field
for a counter that could be bumped every time there is more than one operation
in a single timer tick.  The timestamps could be shifted appropriately when they
were reported to user space and used in full as change attributes.
That would require changing all filesystems, though, so
that there were not different granularities of timestamps being reported on
a given system, Layton said.
</p>

<p>
He then went through the order of operations for updating timestamps and
<tt>i_version</tt>.  There is no locking done for queries of
<tt>i_version</tt>; that means that as soon as the value is updated, which
is currently done before the copy to the page cache, it can be read.
Normally, ctime is updated at the same time as <tt>i_version</tt>, before
the write operation; for directories, though, those updates are done after
the operation because there is a lock being held.
</p>

<p>
In truth, <tt>i_version</tt> is only updated if it has been queried since
the last time it was changed, so the increment is often a no-op.  One way to handle
the race problems, then, might be to increment the value both before and after the
operation; the second of those would be a no-op nearly all of the time, so
the cost should be minimal.  He
may experiment with that some.
</p>

<p>
Crash resilience is something that he has not yet done sufficient
research on, though it has been identified as a potential problem area, he
said.  He and Jan Kara had an idea for a crash counter that could be
tracked by user space; nfsd has a daemon that already tracks some client
information where this could be added.  It is kind of a "blue sky" idea
that would require quite a bit of work, but it would remove the problem of
multiple file states with the same change attribute after a crash.  That,
in turn, would allow the kernel NFS server to report that its change
attribute is monotonically increasing, which is advantageous for NFS
clients. 
</p>

<p>
He would like to expose the change attribute via <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
so that user-space programs, such as <a
href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha">NFS-Ganesha</a>, could
access the value.  It will be important to ensure that only filesystems
that implement the change attribute with the usual semantics expose it that
way, however.
That would also allow a feature he has thought about for a long time: a
"gated write".  The idea would be to fetch the change attribute, then make
some changes to the file in memory, and write the file, but
only if the change attribute was the same.  That would allow synchronizing
writes from  multiple
threads on the same machine, or writes to a network filesystem from multiple machines, without file
locking. 
</p>

<p>
When he asked Layton to lead the session, Goldstein had asked for a
"roadmap" to be presented, but Layton said it was 
"more like a wish list".  He wants to add support for the change attribute to
bcachefs and to figure out what to do for XFS in that regard.  He also
wants to move the <tt>i_version</tt> update (and maybe timestamp updates)
to after the page-cache copy, or do the double bump that he described.
Finally, he wants to figure out what to do about crash resilience.
</p>

<p>
Brauner asked about an idea for shrinking inodes by changing the storage of
the timestamps.  Layton said that came from Torvalds, who pointed out that
consecutive <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.3/source/include/linux/time64.h#L13"><tt>struct&nbsp;timespec64</tt></a>
entries for ctime, mtime, and atime leave alignment gaps.  Switching to
separate entries for the seconds and nanoseconds, as he did in a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240517-amtime-v1-1-7b804ca4be8f@kernel.org/">patch</a>
posted shortly after the summit, saves eight bytes.  There are plans for
how to use some of that savings, he said.
</p>

<p>
There was some final discussion on the roadmap/wish list, with Ted Ts'o
noting that there are no real dependencies between the items, so they could
all be worked on in parallel.  Wong said that there is actually plenty of
room in the XFS inode for a few more counters, but he needed clarification
on when the change attribute needed to be updated.  It seems like the NFSv4
semantics can be supported in a fairly straightforward fashion, so that
piece of puzzle may already be falling into place.

So... he wants etags for filesystems, along with an if-match condition on write.  Seems sane.<br>

Absolutely. It's essentially a cmpxchg primitive for files.<br>
<p>
Ceph supports what they call "assertions" in their object store protocol, so you can do something very similar there by just asserting that the version of the object hasn't changed before doing a write operation. I was able to use that to build a parallel, clustered NFS server on top of cephfs and nfs-ganesha, using a ceph object as a shared database between the nodes. This was _much_ simpler than trying to do something like that with file locking:<br>

Adding a similar interface or capability via syscalls, or io_uring or whatever would be really cool, and not even that hard to do.<br>
<p>
Of course, we all first have to settle on semantics for the STATX_CHANGE_COOKIE across multiple filesystems, which has historically been the hard part.<br>

Also, it's good enough for race-free close-to-open semantics, if the change attribute increment that follows the write also precedes the close or unlock.<br>

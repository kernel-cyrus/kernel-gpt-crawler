<p>
When last we <a href="/Articles/783973/">looked in</a> on the progress of
the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com">WireGuard VPN tunnel</a> toward the
mainline kernel, it seemed like the main sticking point had been overcome.  The <a
href="/Articles/770750/">Zinc cryptography API</a> used by WireGuard was
generally seen as a duplication of effort with the existing kernel
cryptographic algorithms, so an effort to rework Zinc to use that existing
code seemed destined to route around that problem and bring WireGuard to
the mainline.  In the six months since then, though, things have gone
fairly quiet in WireGuard-land; that all changed based on a conversation at
the recent <a href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2019/">Kernel Recipes</a>
conference in Paris.
</p>

<p>
WireGuard developer Jason A. Donenfeld posted a <a
href="/ml/netdev/CAHmME9pmfZAp5zd9BDLFc2fWUhtzZcjYZc2atTPTyNFFmEdHLg@mail.gmail.com/">message</a>
from the conference describing a conversation he had there that included
kernel networking maintainer David Miller.  In the message, Donenfeld
announced that WireGuard would be ported to use the existing crypto API in
the interests of getting it upstream—based on Miller's advice.  Donenfeld
said that he was generally opposed to the idea for a few reasons, but now
thinks it would make sense to go that route "<q>and afterwards work
evolutionarily to get Zinc into Linux 
piecemeal</q>".  He outlined his concerns about the kernel crypto API:
<div class="BigQuote">
I've long resisted the idea of porting to the existing crypto API,
because I think there are serious problems with it, in terms of
primitives, API, performance, and overall safety. I didn't want to
ship WireGuard in a form that I thought was sub-optimal from a
security perspective, since WireGuard is a security-focused project.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In the message, though, he apparently overstated Miller's opinions somewhat.  Miller
<a
href="/ml/netdev/20190925.113928.2046484827308019751.davem@davemloft.net/">complained</a>
that he was being misquoted and was concerned about
Donenfeld's announcement:
<div class="BigQuote">
I didn't say "must" anything, I suggested this as a more [smooth]
and efficient way forward.
<p>
I'm also a bit disappointed that you felt the need to so quickly
make such an explosive posting to the mailing list when we've
just spoken about this amongst ourselves only 20 minutes ago.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/netdev/CAHmME9qK2RWPLWWZGcmtVEHz+vUaVRBNtjv3GutkzWccdogF0w@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that "explosiveness" was not his intent, but that informing the project and
others interested in it was what he was aiming for.    It turns out that
Ard Biesheuvel, who has been critical of the approach tying WireGuard to
Zinc along the way, has been working
on  a patch series to "<q>incorporate WireGuard into the kernel
without relying on a wholesale replacement of the existing crypto
stack</q>".  He <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/20190925161255.1871-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org/">posted</a>
the series to the linux-crypto mailing list—seemingly 
in response to Donenfeld's announcement.
</p>

<p>
Donenfeld's <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAHmME9oDhnv7aX77oEERof0TGihk4mDe9B_A3AntaTTVsg9aoA@mail.gmail.com/">reply</a>
was positive overall, but there were still some fairly strong criticisms of  the
approach.  To start with, he is concerned with the 
performance of using indirect function calls as part of the handshake
process:
<div class="BigQuote">
In this case, the relevance is that the handshake in WireGuard is
extremely performance sensitive, in order to fend off DoS. One of the
big design gambits in WireGuard is – can we make it 1-RTT [round-trip time] to reduce
the complexity of the state machine, but keep the crypto efficient
enough that this is still safe to do from a DoS perspective. The
protocol succeeds at this goal, but in many ways, just by a hair when
at scale, and so I’m really quite loathe to decrease handshake
performance.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He is also unhappy with the use of the asynchronous-oriented parts of the
crypto API, which was a complaint <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAHk-=wjYsbxSiV_XKWV3BwGvau_hUvQiQHLOoc7vLUZt0Wqzfw@mail.gmail.com/">first
raised</a> by Linus Torvalds.  Both Torvalds and Donenfeld think that
avoiding the asynchronous interface is best, at least for the initial
merge.  Donenfeld said:
<div class="BigQuote">
I’d recommend leaving this synchronous as it exists now, as Linus
suggested, and we can revisit that later down the road. There are a
number of improvements to the async API we could make down the line
that could make this viable in WireGuard.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But he definitely wanted to make it clear that he would like to work with Biesheuvel on
getting something ready for the mainline:
<div class="BigQuote">
And for the avoidance of doubt, or in case any of the above message
belied something different, I really am happy and relieved to have an
opportunity to work on this _with you_, and I am much more open than
before to compromise and finding practical solutions to the past
political issues.
</div>
</p>

<p>
For his part, Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAKv+Gu-RLRhwDahgvfvr2J9R+3GPM6vh4mjO73VcekusdzbuMA@mail.gmail.com/">seems
pleased</a> to get things moving along again.  He believes that the crypto
API as a whole could benefit from moving away from the dynamic dispatch
approach:
<div class="BigQuote">
This is one of the issues in the 'fix it for everyone else as well'
category. If we can improve the crypto API to be less susceptible to
these issues (e.g., using static calls), everybody benefits. I'd be
happy to collaborate on that.
</div>
</p>

<p>
"Static calls" are a <a href="/Articles/767707/">technique</a> that turns
indirect function calls into fixed jump instructions, which has performance
and other benefits.  Peter Zijlstra recently <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191007082708.01393931.1@infradead.org/">posted</a>
a <tt>static_call()</tt> patch set, which may be getting closer to being merged.
</p>

<p>
Biesheuvel was a bit surprised that the handshake timing is so sensitive.  He
suggested that it was simply a performance issue, rather than a security
problem. "<q>But the security of any VPN protocol worth its salt should not hinge
on the performance delta between the reference C code and a version
that was optimized for a particular CPU.</q>"  Donenfeld, however, is <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAHmME9rKFUvsQ6hhsKjxxVSnyNQsTaqBKGABoHibCiCBmfxCOA@mail.gmail.com/">adamant</a>
that the fast primitives are required in order to avoid denial-of-service
security problems.  Since there are other reasons that
algorithmic flexibility is needed for WireGuard (though without the
indirect function call overhead), the problem needs to be solved anyway,
he said.
</p>

<p>
Based on the feedback on that first approach, Biesheuvel came back with <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/20190929173850.26055-1-ard.biesheuvel%40linaro.org/">another
RFC patch set</a>.  It reworked the use of the crypto API so that
Torvalds's and Donenfeld's concerns about the using asynchronous interfaces
were addressed:
<div class="BigQuote">
Linus has made it abundantly clear that using the abstract AEAD interface
is not acceptable for instantiating a transformation that is known at compile
time, so I will abandon that approach for the time being. If anyone turns up
with appropriate h/w to run WireGuard in async mode, we might revisit this,
but for sync s/w algorithms, a concrete library interface is clearly
preferred.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There were few comments on those patches, so Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/20191002141713.31189-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org/">followed
up</a> with a v2 of that approach.  This time, Donenfeld had some concerns
about some 
of the architecture-specific optimized implementations of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant">ChaCha20
cipher</a>,
particularly with regard to changes made from the Zinc versions.
Those were largely hashed out in the thread, but a bigger question
surrounded Biesheuvel's switch away from potentially using static calls.
In the patch cover letter, he said:
<div class="BigQuote">
As it turns out, we don't actually need static calls for this.
Instead, we can simply permit weak symbol references to go unresolved
between modules (as we already do in the kernel itself, due to the
fact that ELF permits it), and have the accelerated code live in
separate modules that may not be loadable on certain systems, or be
blacklisted by the user.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/BE18E4E0-D4CC-40B9-96E1-C44D25B879D9@amacapital.net/">wondered</a>
about that mechanism; he pointed out that the symbol resolution was
module-loading-order dependent, which might lead to unexpected results:
<div class="BigQuote">
Won't this have the counterintuitive property that, if you load the modules
in the opposite order, 
the reference won't be re-resolved and performance will silently regress?
<p>
I think it might be better to allow two different modules to export the
same symbol but only allow 
one of them to be loaded. Or use static calls.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAKv+Gu8u8Oco==YRPSa4mq_eZyUcB_Apj-k_vo=7WvTwCp8k+A@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
that module-loading order should not affect which implementation gets
chosen, the fact that static calls are not yet available, and might not be
the right approach even if they were, means that he is proceeding without
them:
<div class="BigQuote">
I have disregarded static calls and weak references for the time
being, and I will proceed with an implementation that uses neither.
The downside of this is that, e.g., we are forced to load the NEON
module on non-NEON capable hardware without calling any of its code,
but this is basically the Zinc situation only with the NEON and the
generic code living in different modules.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That led to the most recent <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/20191007164610.6881-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org/">patch
posting</a> as of this writing.  It has some tweaks here and there and
removes the weak-references-based implementation. As he put it in the
changelog: "<q>Defer using weak references or static calls until the
dust around this has 
settled</q>".  There are some of the expected, minor-sounding comments
on the patches, but overall the sense is that this work is close to being
ready for merging.  The next step is presumably to post it to the
linux-kernel mailing list and, if it passes muster there, get it into
linux-next by way of the crypto 
subsystem tree.  Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/linux-crypto/CAHmME9r9o9EmDoYVV=bGs9Yici900aE2YLN8z-RahSvnP0+mRg@mail.gmail.com/">seemed
satisfied</a> that it is close to being merge-ready, to the point that he
listed things that were deferred from the original Zinc library that
might be taken up again after the merge.  He also
suggested that WireGuard itself would be up next:
<div class="BigQuote">
WireGuard - things are quasi-ready, so when the time comes, I look
forward to submitting that to Dave's net tree as a single boring
[PATCH 1/1].
</div>
</p>

<p>
It would seem that there are no real barriers to the inclusion of this
crypto code, at least so far, and the WireGuard code itself has never really been
controversial—quite the reverse in fact.  One would guess that
"boring" patch posting will still require review and, quite possibly,
revision, but the biggest hurdle has always been the crypto code.  With
luck, that has been cleared at this point—though it also kind of looked
that way back in March.  Mainline WireGuard seems quite plausible for the 5.6
or 5.7 kernel; many are looking forward to that day.

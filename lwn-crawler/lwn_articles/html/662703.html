The process freezer (or just "freezer") holds processes in a suspended
state; it is used, for example, when suspending or hibernating the system.
Jiri Kosina started his 2015 Kernel Summit session by noting that he had
thought he could use the freezer for live patching as well.  But, in the
process of making that work, he found out that the semantics of the freezer
are not particularly well defined; there is no definition of what it means
for a process to be "frozen."  As a result, the implementation of frozen
behavior varies and, in the case of a number of kernel threads
("kthreads"), things are broken entirely.
<p>
The original purpose of the freezer was to get processes out of the way so
that the system could be suspended and to ensure that no unwanted I/O
activity causes filesystem corruption.  The freezer also prevents user
space from taking kernel locks.  Kernel threads, being processes, also are

subject to freezing unless they have the special <tt>PF_NOFREEZE</tt> flag
set.  A freezable kthread that fails to freeze when requested can block the
system from suspending or hibernating.
<p>
One of the first things Jiri noticed was that kthreads will call
<tt>try_to_freeze()</tt> (an indication that this would be a good time to
freeze the thread if needed) without having first called
<tt>set_freezable()</tt> (which clears the <tt>PF_NOFREEZE</tt> flag).
Such threads can never be frozen, so the <tt>try_to_freeze()</tt> call will
always fail.  That suggested to him that the freezer for kthreads is
overused and unneeded.  Some kthreads (those that participate in the I/O
needed to suspend or hibernate the system) cannot be frozen anyway.  For
the rest, the important part is to get them to the point where they
schedule, and that is happening anyway without <tt>try_to_freeze()</tt>.
<p>
Jiri said that the arguments for freezing kernel threads do not hold much
water when examined.  There are some fears that a kthread could hold a lock
and deadlock the hibernation process; if that were true, he said, it would
deadlock the system anyway.  The other reason to freeze kthreads is to
prevent them from initiating I/O, but it is, in fact, important for kthread
I/O to succeed while the system is changing state.  So, rather than
worrying about freezing kthreads, Jiri suggested, why not just
restrict the freezer to user-space processes?  It is unclear why the
freezer even exists for kthreads; it appears to serve no purpose and is
easy to get wrong.
<p>
An alternative idea, Jiri said, would be to annotate I/O that is needed for
the suspend or hibernate process to complete.  Only specially marked
requests would be allowed through; the rest would be blocked until the
system is resumed.  But, he said, this approach seems complex, fragile, and
just as error-prone as what's there now.
<p>
The best solution, he said, might be to get rid of the kthread freezer entirely.
Its main reason for existing is to ensure that filesystems do not get
corrupted when the system suspends and resumes (or fails to resume).  That
could be just as easily accomplished by freezing the filesystems
instead.  The virtual filesystem layer already has support for freezing
filesystems, and the freeze operation ensures that the filesystems are
consistent on disk.  Freezing filesystems would also have the advantage of
preventing bootloaders from trying to replay the journal — something that
overly clever bootloaders evidently do — because there would be no journal
to replay.
<p>
There was a quick consensus in the room that abolishing the freezer looked
like the right way to go.  Thus, chances are, we'll see patches toward that
goal in a future development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Patterns of code that repeat throughout the kernel are often a sign that a
helper function may be appropriate.  That is doubly true if those repeated
patterns include repeated errors or other suboptimal techniques.  The case
of <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> would appear to be just one of those cases; it is
the subject of
<a href="/Articles/711452/">a recent patch set</a>
from Michal Hocko that significantly cleans up a common memory-allocation
pattern in the kernel.
<p>
The kernel offers two fundamental mechanisms for allocating memory, both of
which are, in turn, built on top of the kernel's page allocator.  One of
them, the slab allocator, will obtain physically contiguous memory in the
kernel's own address space; this allocator is typically accessed via
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>, though there are a number of other entry points as
well.  The alternative to the slab allocator is <tt>vmalloc()</tt>, which
will return memory in a 
separate address space; that memory will be virtually contiguous but may be
physically scattered.
<p>
As a general rule, slab allocations are preferred for all but the largest
of allocations.  In the absence of memory pressure, the slab allocator will
be faster, since it does not need to make address-space changes.
The slab allocator
works best with allocations that are less than one physical page (usually
4KB) in size, though.  When memory gets fragmented, groups of physically
contiguous pages can get hard to find, and system performance can suffer as
the allocator struggles to create such groups.
<p>
Allocations with
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> do not need physically contiguous pages and are
thus much more likely to succeed when memory is tight.  But excessive use
of <tt>vmalloc()</tt> is discouraged due to the extra overhead involved;
each allocation done with <tt>vmalloc()</tt> requires page-table changes
and a translation lookaside buffer invalidation.  <tt>vmalloc()</tt> can
only allocate entire pages, so it is not suitable for small requests.
The address range available for <tt>vmalloc()</tt> allocations is also
limited on 32-bit systems, which has historically been another disincentive
to use this interface; that limitation is not present on 64-bit systems,
though. 
<p>
There are a number of places in the kernel where a large allocation
must be physically 
contiguous, but there are probably even more where that doesn't matter.  In
the latter case, the code doesn't have a reason to care which allocation
method was used to obtain its memory, as long as the memory is available.
For this sort of indifferent code, it can make sense to try an allocation
first with the slab allocator, then fall back to <tt>vmalloc()</tt> should
that attempt fail.  And, indeed, the kernel is full of code fragments that
do exactly that.
<p>
However, as Hocko points out in the introduction to the <tt>kvmalloc()</tt>
patch set, some of those fragments are "<q>really creative</q>" and
many of them do not work as intended.  For example, consider the following
simple attempt at a fallback:
<p>
<pre>
    memory = kmalloc(allocation_size, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!memory)
        memory = vmalloc(allocation_size);
</pre>
<p>
The problem here is that, for relatively small allocations (eight pages or
less), 
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> <a href="/Articles/627419/">will retry indefinitely</a>
rather than return failure.  In such cases, the fallback path using
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> will never be executed.  Perhaps worse, the above
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> call will go far out of its way in its attempts to satisfy
the request.  That could, for example, involve unchaining the dreaded
out-of-memory killer to wreak havoc among unsuspecting processes.  There
are times when such drastic actions are needed, but memory-allocation code
that has an 
explicit fallback path does not generally comprise one of those times.
<p>
What is needed, of course, is a simple helper that implements an allocation
using this fallback technique while taking care to minimize the amount of
unnecessary collateral damage.  To that end, Hocko's patch set introduces a
few new functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void *kvmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags);
    void *kvzalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags);
    void *kvmalloc_node(size_t size, gfp_t flags, int node);
    void *kvzalloc_node(size_t size, gfp_t flags, int node);
</pre>
<p>
As one might expect, <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> attempts to allocate <tt>size</tt>
bytes from the slab allocator; it makes a point of using the
<tt>__GFP_NOWARN</tt> and 
<tt>__GFP_NORETRY</tt> flags to minimize the cost (and avoid out-of-memory
killer invocations) when the memory is not
immediately available.  If the attempt fails, <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> will fall
back to <tt>vmalloc()</tt> to perform the allocation.
The <tt>kvzalloc()</tt> variant will zero the memory before
returning it.  The <tt>_node</tt> versions request that the memory be
allocated local to the given NUMA <tt>node</tt>.  As with any other
allocation function, these functions can still fail.
<p>
Note that it doesn't generally make sense to use any of these functions
with allocation requests that are smaller than a single page.  Memory from
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> is not available in sub-page granularity, so the
fallback to <tt>vmalloc()</tt> will not be done in such cases.  They also
will not work as desired if called from atomic context, since
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> cannot be used then.
<p>
It is interesting to note that this is not the first attempt to add
<tt>kvmalloc()</tt> to the kernel; <a href="/Articles/386535/">a
version</a> was posted by Changli Gao in 2010.  That version did not take
the same level of care to avoid unfortunate side effects, though, and was
never merged.  Hocko's patch set, which also converts a large number of
open-coded fallback implementations to the new functions, seems more likely
to find its way into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

An interesting fuzzing technique would be to tweak these new functions to randomly call either kmalloc() or vmalloc().  The calling code shouldn't care which kind of memory it gets, but there may be bugs which don't get tickled in normal operation when kmalloc() almost always succeeds.<br>

One thing I don't understand is why not use just vmalloc() when there is no requirement for allocated memory to be physically contiguous? Why do one need to bother with trying kmalloc() first? Is there any benefits in this?<br>

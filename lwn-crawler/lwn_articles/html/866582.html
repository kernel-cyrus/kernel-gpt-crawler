           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 20, 2021</br>
           </div>
Unix-like systems — and their users — tend to expect all filesystems to
behave in the same way.  But those users are also often interested in fancy
new filesystems offering features that were never envisioned by the
developers of the Unix filesystem model; that has led to a number of
interesting incompatibilities over time.  Btrfs is certainly one of those
filesystems; it provides a long list of features that are found in few
other systems, and some of those features interact poorly with the
traditional view of how filesystems work.  Recently, Neil Brown has been
trying to resolve a specific source of confusion relating to how Btrfs
handles inode numbers.
<p>
One of the key Btrfs features is <a
href="/Articles/579009/">subvolumes</a>, which are essentially 
independent filesystems maintained within a single storage volume.
Snapshots are one commonly used form of subvolume; they allow the storage
of copies of the state of another subvolume at a given point in time, with
the underlying data shared to the extent that it has not been changed since
each snapshot was taken.  There are other applications for subvolumes as
well, and they tend to be heavily used; Btrfs filesystems can contain
thousands of subvolumes.
<p>
Btrfs subvolumes bring some interesting quirks with them.
They can be mounted independently, as if they
were separate filesystems, but they also appear as a part of the filesystem
hierarchy as seen from the root.  So one <i>can</i> mount subvolumes, but a
subvolume can be accessed without being mounted if a higher-level directory
<i>is</i> mounted.  Imagine, for example, that <tt>/dev/sda1</tt> contains
a Btrfs filesystem that has been mounted on <tt>/butter</tt>.  One could
create a pair of subvolumes with commands like:
<p>
<pre>
    # cd /butter
    # btrfs subvolume create subv1
    # btrfs subvolume create subv2
</pre>
<p>
The root of <tt>/butter</tt> will now appear to contain two directories
(<tt>subv1</tt> and <tt>subv2</tt>):
<p>
<pre>
    # tree /butter
    /butter
    ├── subv1
    └── subv2

    2 directories, 0 files
</pre>
<p>

They behave like directories most of
the time but, since they are actually subvolumes, there are some
differences; one cannot rename a file from one to the other, for example.
A suitably privileged user can now mount either <tt>subv1</tt> or
<tt>subv2</tt> (or both) as independent filesystems.  But, as long as
<tt>/butter</tt> remains mounted, <i>both</i> subvolumes are visible as if
they were part of the same filesystem.  There are some interesting
consequences from this behavior, as will be seen.
<p>

 Btrfs uses a subvolume ID number internally to identify
subvolumes, but there is no way to make that number directly visible to
user space.  Instead, the filesystem allocates a separate device number
(the usual major/minor pair) for each
subvolume;  that number can be seen with a system call like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lstat.2.html"><tt>stat()</tt></a>.
If the subvolumes are not explicitly mounted, though, numbers do not show
up in files like 
<tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt>, leading to inconsistent views of how the
filesystem is put together.  [<b>Update</b>: as Brown pointed out to us
privately, the numbers do not show up there even if the subvolumes
<i>are</i> explicitly mounted.]
A call to <tt>stat()</tt> on a file within a
subvolume will return a device number that does not exist in files like
<tt>mountinfo</tt>, a situation that occasionally confuses unaware
applications.
<p>
It gets worse.  Since Btrfs has a unique internal ID for each subvolume, it
feels no particular need to keep inode numbers unique across those
subvolumes.  As a result, a process walking a Btrfs filesystem from the
root may well encounter multiple files with the same inode number.  Tools
like <tt>find</tt> use inode numbers as a way of tracking which files they
have already seen and detecting filesystem loops.  For a locally mounted
Btrfs filesystem, things mostly work as expected because, even though two
files on different subvolumes may have the same inode number, they will
have different device numbers and are thus distinct.
<p>

The kernel's NFS daemon, though, has a harder time of
things.  It cannot present all of those artificial device numbers to NFS
clients, because that would require all of the subvolumes — again, possibly
thousands of them — to show up as
separate mounts on the client.  So a Btrfs filesystem exported via NFS
shows the same device number (the device number of the root) on
all subvolumes.  That works most of the
time, but it can make it impossible to use a tool like <tt>find</tt> on an
NFS-mounted Btrfs filesystem with subvolumes.  The single device number
makes it impossible to distinguish files with the same inode number on
different subvolumes, causing <tt>find</tt> to abort with a message about
filesystem loops.  This leads to occasional <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/20210310074620.GA2158@tik.uni-stuttgart.de/">complaints</a>
from users and a desire to somehow improve the situation.
<p>
These problems are not new; they have been known and understood for years.
The level of complaints seems to be rising, though, perhaps as a
consequence of increased use of Btrfs in production situations.  In theory,
the way to solve these problems is understood as well — though not all
developers have the same understanding, as Neil Brown found out when he
took on the task of fixing Btrfs filesystems exported via NFS.  The <a
href="/Articles/866709/">second 
and last article in this series</a>, published on August&nbsp;23, explores
various attempted solutions to this problem and why it turns out to be so
hard to fix.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sometimes shows up inside docker containers. rename(2) will return an error if the source and destination folders happen to be on a different layer, which may be less than transparent to users unfamiliar with the specifics of docker&#x27;s default storage driver.<br>
<p>
This situation is made more confusing by the fact that some tools (like mv) handle this transparently (by recursive copy), while other tools appear to mysteriously work for some destination folders and fail for others.<br>

This problem of how to expose subvolumes over a network file system is probably easier for SMB3 (e.g. Samba or ksmbd) to deal with because when you have a subvolume you can redirect the client transparently back to the subvolume with a DFS referral.<br>

Well we (Samba) do have problems with inode duplication. However, because we do all access via a user-pluggable VFS API we have modules like vfs_fileid:<br>

So the problem is that NFS doesn’t support nested mountpoints - and btrfs makes them more common? Or that those mountpoints don’t appear in the list of mounts and this confuses the NFS server?<br>

AIUI what is being described is that:<br>
<p>
* Btrfs subvols _can_ be mounted independently of their &quot;parent&quot;, but do not show up as distinct mounted filesystems unless you do that<br>
* They don&#x27;t promise unique inode numbers between them, so this would break far more things, except dev_id is unique, so most things notice that<br>
* Mounting over NFS doesn&#x27;t expose the dev_id being unique any more, resulting in fire<br>
<p>
I look forward to seeing what expectations various solutions break, as I&#x27;d probably default to wanting the subvols to have to be explicit mounts, but if someone was relying on not needing crossmnt or similar, they might be surprised one day...<br>

I disagree with the assertion (commonly held) that btrfs subvols are &quot;essentially independent filesystems&quot;.<br>
 - they cannot be independently synced with syncfs()<br>
 - statfs() does not provide different information for different subvols  (except the f_fsid) - so they are identical in &quot;df&quot;.<br>
 - they do NOT appear in /proc/mounts.  The entries that appear in /proc/mounts are no different to bind-mounts for some arbitrary directory within the filesystem<br>
  <br>
btrfs &quot;subvolumes&quot; are much more like project-quota trees as found in xfs, ext4, and f2fs, which also prevent renames from one tree to another and so are, in some sense, independent subtrees.<br>
The particular value-add of btrfs &quot;subvolumes&quot; is that you can effectively create a reflink to one.<br>

Sounds to me as if btrfs is pretty much unusable in any place where correctness matters (so 99% of use cases in practice) without giving it another 20 years for each and every tool to work around its idiosyncrasies.<br>
<p>
The question is then, what does btrfs bring to the table that makes it useful enough for everyone to invest that much effort into it?<br>

As comments above indicate, this is also a problem with the various union file systems.  Are they also unusable in production?<br>

You can of course wait for another 20 years before using btrfs.<br>
Meanwhile we continue to enjoy btrfs detecting and fixing otherwise silent data corruption via its checksums, live migrations, almost instant snapshots locally and very fast offsite backups via send/receive and keep wondering what those correctness problems could be that keep you from doing the same.<br>

There&#x27;s no generic VFS (or NFS) way to do it, but there is an ioctl that returns the subvol ID number of an open fd on btrfs (INO_LOOKUP on the constant subvol root inode number).<br>

      Well, I mount it on <code>/toast</code> and make sure it contains files <code>marmalade</code> and <code>melted-cheese</code>...

      You bet. And copying <code>peanut-butter</code> prior to the other two makes it even nicer...

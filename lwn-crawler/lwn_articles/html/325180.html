<p>
An in-kernel tracing infrastructure for user-space code, utrace, has long
been in a kind of pending state; it has shipped in every Fedora kernel
since Fedora Core 6, and has done some time in the -mm tree, but it has
never gotten into the mainline.  That may now be changing, given a recent
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324753/">push for inclusion</a> of the
core utrace code.  There are some lingering questions about including
utrace, at least for 2.6.30, because the patchset doesn't add any
in-kernel user of the interface.
</p>

<p>
Utrace grew out of Roland McGrath's work on maintaining the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> system call.  That call is used by user-space programs
to do things like trace system calls using <tt>strace</tt>, but it is also
used in less obvious ways&mdash;to implement user-mode-linux (UML) for
example.  While <tt>ptrace()</tt> has generally sufficed,
it is, by all accounts, a rather ugly and flawed interface both for kernel
hackers to maintain and for developers to use.  McGrath <a
href="/Articles/325247/">described the genesis of utrace</a> in a recent
linux-kernel post:
<div class="BigQuote">
I hatched the essential design of utrace when I'd recently spent a whole
lot of time fixing the innards of ptrace and a whole lot of time helping
userland implementors of debuggers and the like figure out how to work
with ptrace (and hearing their complaints about it).  At the same time,
the group I'm in (still) was contemplating both the implementation
issues of a generic debugger, how to make it tractable to work up to far
smarter debuggers, and also the design of what became systemtap.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Basically, utrace implements a framework for controlling user-space tasks.
It provides an interface that can be used by various tracing "engines",
implemented 
as loadable kernel modules, that wish to be notified of events that occur
on threads 
of interest.  As might be expected, engines register callback functions for
specific events, then attach to whichever thread they wish to trace.
</p>
<p>
The
callbacks are made from "safe" places in the kernel, which allows the
functions great leeway in the kinds of processing they can do.
No locks are held when the callbacks are made, so they can block for a short
time (in calls like 
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>), but they shouldn't block for long periods.  Doing so,
risks making the <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal from working properly. If the
callback needs to wait for I/O or block on some other long-running
activity, it should stop the execution of the thread and return, then
resume the thread when the operation completes.
</p>

<p>
There are various events that can be watched via utrace: system call entry
and exit, <tt>fork()</tt>, signals being sent to the task, etc.
Single-stepping through a task being traced can also be handled via
utrace.  One of the benefits that utrace provides, which <tt>ptrace()</tt>
lacks, is the ability to have multiple engines tracing the same task.
Utrace is well documented in <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/roland/utrace/DocBook/">DocBook manual</a>
included with the patch.
</p>

<p>
LWN first <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224772/">looked at utrace</a>
just over two years ago, but, since then, it has largely disappeared from
view.  Reimplementing <tt>ptrace()</tt> using utrace is 
certainly one of the goals, but the current patches do not do that.  But,
there is a fundamental disagreement between McGrath and other kernel
hackers about whether utrace can be merged without it.  The problem is that
there is no in-tree user of the new interface, and, as Ted Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/325267/">put it</a>, "<q>we need
to have a user for the kernel interface along with the new kernel
interface</q>". 
</p>

<p>
The proposed utrace patchset consists of a small patch to clean up some of
the tracehook functionality, a large 4000 line patch that implements the
utrace core, and another patch that adds an ftrace tracer that is based on
utrace event handling. The latter, implemented by SystemTap
developer Frank Eigler, would provide an in-tree user of the new utrace
code, but received a rather <a href="/Articles/325259/">chilly response</a>
from Ingo Molnar: "<q>[...] without the
ftrace plugin the  
whole utrace machinery is just something that provides a _ton_ of 
hooks to something entirely external: SystemTap mainly.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Therein lies one of the main concerns expressed about utrace.  The
utrace-ftrace interface is not seen as a real user of utrace, more of a
"<q>big distraction</q>", as Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/325268/">called it</a>.  The worry is that adding utrace
just makes it easier to keep SystemTap out of the mainline.  While the
kernel hackers have some serious reservations about the specifics of the
SystemTap implementation, they would like to see it head towards the
mainline.  The fear is that by merging things like utrace, it may enable
SystemTap to stay out of the mainline that much longer.  Molnar posted his <a
href="/Articles/325294/">take</a> on the issue, concluding:
<div class="BigQuote">
Putting utrace upstream now will just make it more 
convenient to have SystemTap as a separate entity - without any of 
the benefits. Do we want to do that? Maybe, but we could do better i 
think.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In addition, Molnar is not pleased that the utrace changes haven't been
reviewed by the ftrace developers and were submitted just as the merge
window for 2.6.30 is about to open.  He believes that McGrath, Eigler, and
the other utrace developers should be working with the ftrace team:
<div class="BigQuote">
kernel/utrace.c should probably be introduced as 
kernel/trace/utrace.c not kernel/utrace.c. It also overlaps pending 
work in the tracing tree and cooperation would be nice and desired.
<p>
The ftrace/utrace plugin is the only real connection utrace has to 
the mainline kernel, so proper review by the tracing folks and 
cooperation with the tracing folks is very much needed for the whole 
thing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But McGrath sees things rather differently.  From his perspective, utrace
has enough usefulness in its own right&mdash;not primarily as just a piece
of SystemTap&mdash;to be considered for the mainline.  Several different
uses for utrace, in addition to the <tt>ptrace()</tt> cleanup, were
mentioned in the thread: <a href="/Articles/325295/">kmview</a>, a kernel
module for virtualization; uprobes for DTrace-style user-space probing;
changing UML to use utrace directly, rather than <tt>ptrace()</tt>; and
more.  Eigler also <a href="/Articles/325296/">defended</a> utrace as a
standalone feature:
<div class="BigQuote">
utrace is a better way to perform user thread management than what is
there now, and the utrace-ftrace widget shows how to *hook* thread
events such as syscalls in a lighter weight / more managed way than
the first one proposed. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Molnar would like to see the "rewrite-ptrace-via-utrace" patch included
before merging utrace.  That would give the facility a solid in-kernel
user, which could be used by other kernel developers to test and debug
utrace.  But, McGrath is not yet <a href="/Articles/325297/">ready to
submit that code</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
The utrace-ptrace code there today is really not
very nice to look at, and it's not ready for prime time.  As has been
mentioned, it is a "pure clean-up exercise".  As such, it's not the top
priority.  It also didn't seem to me like much of an argument for merging
utrace: "Look, more code and now it still does the same thing!"
</div>
</p>

<p>
In some ways, the association with SystemTap is unfairly coloring the
reaction to utrace.  Molnar posted an excellent <a
href="/Articles/325298/">summary</a> of the issues that stop him (and other
kernel hackers) from using SystemTap&mdash;along with some possible
solutions&mdash;but utrace and SystemTap aren't equivalent.  It may not
make sense to merge utrace without a serious in-kernel user of the
interface, but most of the rest of the arguments have been about SystemTap,
not utrace.  As McGrath <a href="/Articles/325300/">puts it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
This ptrace work really buys nothing with immediate pay-off at all.  It's a
real shame if its lack keeps people from actually looking at utrace itself.
(This has been a long conversation so far with zero discussion of the code.)
A collaboration with focus on what new things can be built, rather than on
reasons not to let the foundations be poured, would be a lovely thing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It remains to be seen whether utrace will make its way into 2.6.30 or not.
Linus Torvalds was <a href="/Articles/325302/">unimpressed</a> with
utrace dominating Fedora kerneloops.org reports, as <a
href="/Articles/325309/">relayed</a> by Molnar&mdash;though the bug that
caused those problems has been long fixed.  McGrath sees value in
merging utrace before the <tt>ptrace()</tt> rewrite is ready, while other
kernel developers do not.  If utrace misses this merge window, it would
seem likely that it will return for 2.6.31, along with the rewrite; at that
point merging would seem quite likely.

<p>
The ftrace plugin posted in the series is exactly such a proposed in-tree user.  If that does not count somehow, then what justification exists for the many tracepoints/events/hooks for which there exist "only" analogous ftrace consumers in-tree?

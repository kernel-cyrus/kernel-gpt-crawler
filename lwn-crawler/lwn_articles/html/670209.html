The kernel development community is organized as a hierarchy, with
developers submitting patches to maintainers who will, in turn, commit
those patches 
to a repository and push them upstream to higher-level maintainers.  This
hierarchy logically looks a lot like the directory hierarchy of the kernel
source itself; most maintainers look after one or more subtrees of the
kernel source tree.  But does that model really describe how patches make
it into the mainline?  The kernel's git repository, with the aid of some
scripting, holds an answer to that question.
<p>
With one exception, the process of pulling patches from one repository to
another leaves a sign in the form of a merge commit.  Those merge commits
stay with their associated patches as they are pulled into subsequent
repositories, eventually leaving clues to the
pull history in the mainline repository.  By working through the history
and finding the merge that pulled in each patch, one can work out one
plausible path by which each patch got to the mainline.  The process takes
a while to run and tends to make one's laptop warm up, but it produces
interesting results in the end.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/670213/"><img

alt="[Patch's progress plot]" hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right" border=0></a> 

(A note for the curious: the one exception mentioned above is
"fast-forward" merges, where the destination repository has not changed
since the source repository diverged from it.  Some projects fear merge
commits and insist that all merges be fast-forward merges, but that policy
causes the loss of some useful information.  In any case, a no-merges
policy would be difficult to scale to a project the size of the kernel.
Fast-forward merges are rare in the kernel community, and almost
never happen for merges into the mainline.)
<p>

The result of running this analysis is the plot shown to the right; click
on the image to see the plot in its full, 2.1MB glory.
<p>
An aphorism occasionally heard among kernel developers is "design in
layers, implement flat."  It reflects the learned wisdom that layering is a
useful design and abstraction tool, but excessive layering in
implementations tends to lead to
overhead and poor performance.  This plot suggests that the kernel
development community itself grew as if it were designed with this same
heuristic in 
mind.  The kernel source tree is a multi-layer hierarchy, and the
maintainers are theoretically organized in the same way, but, in the end,
almost every maintainer pushes patches directly to Linus and, thus,
directly into the mainline repository.  Most of the time, there are no
intermediaries between subsystem maintainers and Linus.
<p>
Why are things organized that way?  One reason is clearly to minimize the
latency built into the system; once changes are committed by a maintainer,
they can get to the mainline quickly if need be.  This organization breaks
pull requests into (mostly) manageable pieces that Linus can look over
directly, allowing him to maintain some idea of what is happening in all
parts of the kernel.  And, importantly, it reflects the fact that Linus
feels he can trust a fairly large number of maintainers to not sneak
questionable changes into a pull request.  He relies heavily on subsystem
maintainers to properly review changes from developers, but he does not
need higher-level maintainers to review the work the subsystem maintainers
are doing.
<p>
Clearly, such a system will only work if that trust is maintained.  Equally
important is the ability for Linus to be able to manage pull requests from
that many maintainers.  Those who have been watching the kernel community
for a long time will remember the frightening process-scalability crises
that occurred regularly prior to the introduction of BitKeeper (and the
subsequent switch to Git).  Over five years ago, when kernel development
cycles still ran under 10,000 changes and involved a maximum of 1,200
developers, we <a href="/Articles/393694/">asked whether Linus was reaching
a scalability limit</a>.  At the beginning of 2015, cycles run more
quickly, bring in 13,000 changes, and will soon involve 1,600 developers,
and there are no real signs of strain.
<p>
It is good to know, though, that the process would easily accommodate
spreading out the top-level responsibility if need be â€” should Linus get
overwhelmed or simply step aside in favor of somebody else.  He has
advocated in favor of maintainer groups for subsystems; at some point,
perhaps we'll have a maintainer group for the top-level repository as well.
<p>
The two trees that feed the most patches to the mainline are interesting in
that they show two different maintainer styles.  The most active tree in
4.4 was, as it often is, the staging tree, run by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
2,454 changes went through the staging tree in this cycle, but <strike>not
a single 
one</strike> only 122 of them were merged from another repository; 
Greg applied each of the other 2,332 patches
himself.  That's 35 patches applied each day over the course of the
entire 70-day development cycle.  Like many subsystem maintainers, Greg
<a href="http://markmail.org/message/r4ocl7nrwfzxab4h">would rather see</a>
patches posted to (and applied from) public mailing lists 
rather than coming directly from other repositories.
<p>
The other tree at the top consists of David Miller's networking trees ("net" and
"net-next") which, together, sent 2,276 patches into the mainline.  The
networking developers use the deepest hierarchy of any kernel subsystem,
with a large percentage of the patches moving into David's tree from some
other subsystem tree.  The style of this group is also to use separate
repositories for development ("net-next," for example) and for fixes
("net"), while other subsystems tend to put more things into the same
repository, using branches to organize them.  Thus, for example, the "tip"
repository (with x86 and 
core-kernel work) and the arm-soc repository (numerous ARM-architecture
topics) each generated numerous large pull requests during this development
cycle, but each shows as a single tree in this plot.  One could separate
these streams by looking at the name of the branches pulled from, at the
risk of adding a fair amount of noise to the plot.
<p>
Attentive readers may have wondered at the use of the term "one plausible
path" in the description of the algorithm at the top of this article.

alt="[treeplot snippet]" hspace=5 vspace=3 align="right">

Consider the small piece of the plot shown to the right; it shows
a single commit flowing from Mark
Brown's "regmap" repository toward net-next.  That flow represents <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/61d0372028d98046176a8a36e40b78b5bbac5512">this
merge commit</a>, wherein David pulled <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/77792b11409c9270d98e604b4314b85ce886ac7d">a
single change</a> from the regmap repository.  When Linus pulled net-next, he
will have gotten that change with the rest.  But that same commit was also a
part of <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/5062ecdb662bf3aed6dc975019c53ffcd3b01d1c">this
merge by Linus</a> which brought the rest of the regmap work directly into the
mainline repository.  At this point, the repository history shows that fix
as having come via the latter merge, but the former merge remains in the
history as well.  More complicated patterns can be found, especially when
developers perform "back merges" of a higher-level tree into their own
repositories.  Such merges are discouraged unless there is a good reason,
partly because they tend to obscure the commit history.
<p>
Doubtless there are other interesting things to be learned by watching how
changes make their way through the kernel development community and its
repositories.  For those who are interested in looking further, the tools
used to create this plot can be found in the gitdm repository:
git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git.

error; see the comments for details.]

Same for Dave's drm tree. Tons of subtrees feed into that. Some of them occasionally feed directly to Linus (when Dave is on vacation essentially), and that's where at least drm-intel seems to be connected to. But the vast majority of patches go in indirectly.<br>

      So this is downright mysterious.  I reran the analysis and got the correct plot; no code changes were involved.  Somehow I must have generated a plot from an older run and was in too much of a hurry to notice how wrong it was.  That was inexcusably sloppy, and I must apologize.
<p>
The plots have been updated, and there has been a minor tweak to the text as well.  The points made in the article still hold, though the structure isn't quite as flat as it appeared before.

It's indeed still really flat with at most 2 levels (some trees seem misplaced due to a topic branch merging into another subsystem, but really should be one level above, e.g. tip or net-next vs. net-fixes). But somewhere above a few hundred commits subsystem trees seem to prefer splitting into a two-level hierarchy or group maintainership, since one person alone stops scaling well enough. Interestinly Linus himself merges just shy of 300 pull requests each release on average (if my cmdline is done right) for the past few releases, kinda confirming that a single maintainer can easily scale to that many patches/merges/pull requests per release. There's almost no trees with more than 500 patches, so I expect that the current approach with 2 levels for busy subsystems should work well enough even for 100k (still much less than 500^2) commits per release. It will be an interesting time when/if the community breaks past that barrier ...<br>

Yeah the updated graph looks a lot more accurate. And it shows that of the big subsystems (staging, net, drm, arm-soc, tip, usb, ...) really staging is the exception, and all other huge trees/subsystems work with a 2-level hierarchy of some form.<br>

Trivial issue: looks like some repos were used with both http:// and https://, and those show up as separate entries (e.g., http(s)://github.com/Broadcom/stblinux). I also see that some github addresses are listed with and without the http(s):// protocol prefix (e.g., (http://)github.com/anholt/linux). This skews the picture a bit.<br>

I also notice that the colons in the protocol specifier are converted to slashes. So we have http/// instead of http://.<br>

      Yeah, that was one I meant to deal with but somehow didn't...I'd forgotten that people still use http with git.  Tweaked and updated, thanks.

I think this is going to have a certain amount of survivor bias. In the same way that open investment funds are likely to have done better than the average investment fund last year (as poorly performing ones will close and new ones open)... as I understand this analysis it shows the path of "successful" patches... and won't show patches that a node in the hierarchy refused to pull (where a separate patch set was created back at a leaf and that commit made it to main line).<br>
<p>
It's still very interesting (and I'm no kernel developer and I may have mis understood).<br>

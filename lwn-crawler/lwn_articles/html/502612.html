           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 19, 2012</br>
           </div>
Some kernel behavior is determined by standards like POSIX; others are
simply a function of what the kernel developers implemented.  The latter
type of behavior can, in theory, be changed if there is a good reason to do
so, but there is always a risk of breaking an application that depended on
the previous behavior.  Even worse, this kind of problem can be impossible
to find during development and, indeed, may lurk until long after the new
code has been deployed.  A system call patch currently under consideration
shows how hard it can be to know when a change is truly safe.
<p>
The <tt>msync()</tt> system call exists to request that a file-backed
memory region created with <tt>mmap()</tt> be written back to persistent
storage.  Once upon a time, <tt>msync()</tt> was the only way to guarantee
that modified pages would be saved to disk in any reasonable period of time;
the kernel could not always detect 
on its own that they had been changed by the application.  That problem has
long since been dealt with, but <tt>msync()</tt> is still a good way to
inform the kernel that now would be a good time to flush modified pages to
disk. 
<p>
Paolo Bonzini recently posted <a href="/Articles/502616/">a small patch
set</a> making a couple of changes to <tt>msync()</tt>.  The actual API
does not change at all, but how the system call implements the API changes
in subtle and interesting ways.
<p>
There are a few options to <tt>msync()</tt>, one of which
(<tt>MS_ASYNC</tt>) asks that the writeback of modified pages be
"scheduled," but not necessarily completed immediately.  It is meant to be
a non-blocking system call that sets the necessary actions in motion, but
does not wait for them to complete.  Current kernels will write back dirty
pages as part of the normal writeback process; the system behaves, in other
words, as if <tt>msync(MS_ASYNC)</tt> were being called on a regular basis
on every mapping.  Writeback of dirty pages is already scheduled as soon as
the page is dirtied.
Given that, there's not much work for an explicit
<tt>MS_ASYNC</tt> call from user space to do, and, indeed, the kernel
essentially ignores such calls.
<p>
Paolo's patch causes the kernel to immediately start I/O on modified pages
in response to <tt>MS_ASYNC</tt> calls.  The result is to get those pages
to persistent storage a bit more quickly than would otherwise happen, but
still avoid blocking the calling process.  The change seems reasonable,
but Andrew Morton <a
href="/Articles/502618/">worried</a> that this behavioral change might be a
problem for some users:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Means that people will find that their msync(MS_ASYNC) call will
	newly start IO.  This may well be undesirable for some.  Also, it
	hardwires into the kernel behaviour which userspace itself could
	have initiated, with sync_file_range().  ie: reduced flexibility.
</div>
<p>
Most users are unlikely to notice the change at all.  But it's entirely
possible that somebody out there has a precisely-tuned system that will
choke if the underlying I/O behavior changes.  Users complain about exactly
this kind of change at times, but usually when the change shows up in a new
enterprise kernel, years too late.

That said, many patches make behavioral changes that can affect users in
surprising ways.  The only thing that is different about this one is that
the nature of the change is understood from the beginning.  Andrew's
concerns were not echoed by others and may not be enough to keep this
change from being merged.
<p>
The other change is potentially more troubling.  <tt>msync()</tt> takes two
parameters indicating the offset and length of the memory area to be
written back.  But the kernel has always ignored those parameters, choosing
instead to just write back all modified pages in the file, and the related
metadata as well.  Paolo's patch changes the implementation to only
synchronize the specific pages requested by the user.
<p>
It would be hard to argue that the new behavior breaks the documented API;
the offset and length parameters are there for a reason, after all.  Still,
once again, Andrew <a href="/Articles/502620/">worried</a> that
applications could break in especially unpleasant ways:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Would be nice, but if applications were previously assuming that an
	msync() was syncing the whole file, this patch will secretly and
	subtly break them.
</div>
<p>
No developer should have written a program with the assumption that
<tt>msync()</tt> would write pages outside of the range it was given.  Any
such program would clearly be buggy.  But, programs written that way will
work under current kernels.  Changing <tt>msync()</tt> to not write some
pages that it currently writes could cause such programs to fail in strange
and difficult-to-reproduce ways.  
<p>
In general, the kernel tries not to break existing applications, even if
those applications can be said to have been written in a buggy manner.  If
something works now, it should continue to work with future kernels.  If
the <tt>msync()</tt> changes described here break those programs, the
changes should probably not be merged into the kernel.

The problem, of course, is that it can be very difficult to know if
a specific change will break somebody's application.  Any problems caused
by subtle changes are relatively unlikely to turn 
up before the changes are included in a released kernel.  So it is
necessary to proceed with care.  That said, it is not practical to hold
back every change that <i>might</i> break a badly-written program
somewhere; kernel development would likely be slowed considerably by such a
constraint.  So, probably, these changes will probably go in unless an
affected user happens to notice a problem in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just a guess, but if you change MS_ASYNC to immediately being syncing, wouldn't that reduce the kernel's ability to defer syncing in, e.g. mobile and low-power environments?<br>

If my spinning platters started spinning more frequently (or failed to spin down as often), I know I'd be annoyed.<br>

In that case, why the MS_ASYNC at all?  just leave it for the kernel.<br>

It's not unusual to see msync (with MS_ASYNC) used to detect whether a certain address is mapped or not - for instance, inside in-process stack tracers that may need to follow random pointers. Unless I'm mistaken, libunwind does exactly this. It may be undersirable if this suddenly becomes a lot more expensive.<br>
<p>
Playing around with SIGSEGV handlers is one alternative, but it's often slower and kind of dangerous in what is typically already a precarious context (inside a signal handler itself, for example), or with multiple threads.<br>

Maybe. There is no guarantee that write(2) from an invalid address wouldn't cause a SIGSEGV instead of returning EFAULT. I could be mistaken, but I believe Linux has actually behaved that way before. msync(2) seems to be more tolerant in general.<br>
<p>
Another interesting use of libunwind is for profiling, for which performance is attractive. (Yes, there are alternatives, but libunwind is fairly portable.)<br>

I'm really curious why you think this.  It seems totally bogus to me: the kernel is the one doing the address space checking, not userspace.  You would need to add extra code to get the weird and (I think) non-POSIX behavior of delivering a signal to userspace.  What gave you the idea that a signal might be delivered?<br>

I may have misunderstood it entirely, but I was under the impression from old discussions on linux-kernel (that I wish I could find now—sorry) that Posix actually would allow this. Consider an implementation that implements all or parts of write() in user space, for instance.<br>
<p>
You would then rightly ask why msync() would be exempt from such a behaviour, and to that I have no good answer. I have seen that syscall being used for this purpose (address checking) in a variety of places, however, misguided or not.<br>

I think glusterfs has a shim library that will intercept some calls to glibc and interpose its own functions.  So you might call write() and end up getting a userspace version.  So I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility.  Of course, glusterfs could theoretically intercept msync as well-- I don't know if their shim library does or not.<br>
<p>
I would guess that the people using msync to check whether an address is valid are using it more because it doesn't require you to have any open file descriptors, than because they're being "careful."  In fact, it's not even clear according to the man page that you can use msync on memory that wasn't allocated with mmap.  I really have no idea what msync is "supposed" to do on memory allocated with brk, for example.  So it's just another case of people relying on some pretty hairy implementation details.<br>
<p>
As far as I can see, your best bet for checking address validity probably is "mincore."  It definitely doesn't make any sense for a shim library to intercept that function.<br>

Anyone intercepting relatively-bare syscalls and converting them into library functions like that had better trap SIGSEGV during the call and convert it into an -EFAULT return. It's not like that's terribly hard (though it does require flipping signal dispositions twice, that's fast as syscalls go).<br>

<p>
But do the standards or conventional architecture really call for that?  I don't think the POSIX definition of write() uses the word "kernel" and I believe the general understanding for any library is that if you pass an invalid address to a subroutine, it might generate a SIGSEGV.
<p>
Or are you just making a practicality argument, since people might be depending on EFAULT.  I think it would be a pretty unusual program that passes invalid addresses to write() when the program isn't broken.

It's practicality. If you're trying to transparently, replace a function that normally EFAULTs on events that would cause userspace to SIGSEGV, it behooves you to behave the same way, lest you break some weird program that really depends on this. (I wrote one once. It does happen.)<br>

Maybe I'm missing something important but it sounds like these two changes make the system call behave more like the documentation.  That should be a good thing and a no brainer.<br>
<p>
The first change, causing it to actually get busy writing when the call is made but without blocking is kinda what you should have been expecting from explicitly making that call in the first place.  The existing kernel behavior of basically ignoring the whole request is the error.  If you could live with it getting written eventually when the system got around to it you could have skipped the call and got the same result.<br>
<p>
Same for the range.  It is actually implementing behavior that has long been documented in the API but left unwritten.  Even if you have a bug and are specifying the range wrong you still get the same result you used to get, a write when the kernel gets a spare roundtuit.  So all this is doing is increasing the odds that a range that is correctly specified will get written in the case of a crash.  It could have happened before though and it might not, and it still might not get written.  So all one can say is if you have buggy code it is possible you will get bitten a little more often with this change but probably all that will happen is you won't get as much of an improvement in reliability.<br>

I am surprised this did not come up in the article. Maintaining backward compatibility with possibly existing old programs is relevant, but is it really more important than making sure the kernel behavior matches the API documentation so that *future* programs will behave as expected?<br>
<p>
The other alternative would of course be to deprecate the old calls and replace them with newer ones that do what you'd expect from the documentation and then carefully document all the ways in which the old syscalls don't actually do what they advertise. This alternative sounds horrible in a very Redmondesque way.<br>

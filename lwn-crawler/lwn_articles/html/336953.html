<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 17, 2009</br>
           </div>
The process of merging patches for 2.6.31 has begun.  As of this writing,
6220 non-merge changesets have been added to the mainline. Some
of the more 
interesting, user-visible change include:
<p>

<ul>

<li> Reads from <tt>/dev/zero</tt> can now be interrupted by signals.  In
     theory, no application should be adversely affected by this change,
     but is still a true user-space ABI change.  
<p>
<li> The x86 architecture can now handle 46-bit physical addresses,
     allowing the use of up to 64TB of physical memory.
<p>
<li> A number of Xen features meant to support Dom0 functionality
     (the <tt>/dev/xen/evtchn</tt> event channel code ant
     <tt>/sys/hypervisor</tt>, for example) have been merged.  The Dom0
     code itself remains outside, though.
<p>
<li> Support for the <tt>rt_tgsigqueueinfo()</tt> system call, which sends
     a signal (with ancillary information) to a thread group, has been added.
<p>
<li> A number of ftrace features have been added.  These include a function
     profiler, a number of event tracer improvements, some new tracepoints,
     and a new docbook document describing static tracepoints in the kernel.
<p>
<li> The USB TTY port driver has been reworked in ways which bring it into
     closer alignment with POSIX behavior and that of other types of serial
     ports.  Alan Cox fears that some applications which depended on the
     old behavior might break - though others, which had problems with USB
     serial ports, should now begin to work.
<p>
<li> There is a new sysctl knob
     (<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled</tt>); writing "1" to that file
     will cause module loading to be forevermore disallowed.
<p>
<li> The SMACK security module now has a comprehensive  logging facility.
<p>
<li> The <tt>splice()</tt> system call now works when both the input and
     output files are pipes.
<p>
<li> The storage topology patches (<a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327740/">covered briefly</a> in April)
     have been merged.  This code allows the kernel to export much more
     information about how storage devices are structured, enabling support
     for upcoming hardware.
<p>
<li> The performance counters patch set (<a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/311850/">last covered</a> in December)
     have been merged.  This code provides a new API for the use of
     hardware performance counters; it edges out perfmon and a number of
     other implementations in this area.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308445/">character devices in
     user space</a> (CUSE) patch set has been merged.

<p>
<li>
<tt>arch-imx</tt> has been removed from the ARM architecture
as it has been
superseded by the MXC architecture.

<p>
<li>
The s390 architecture has added support for dynamic ftrace, as well as the
system call and function graph tracers.


<p>
<li>
The packet_mmap changes for the transmission side of packet sockets was
merged, which allows for 
more efficient, nearly zero-copy, packet sends from user space.

<p>
<li>
The controller area network (CAN) subsystem has added a network device
driver interface and a netlink interface.  New CAN device drivers have also
been 
merged using the driver interface (see below).

<p>
<li>
Support for IEEE 802.15.4 sockets has been added to the network subsystem.
This is for low-cost, low-speed "personal area networks".

<p>
<li>
<a href="/Articles/336921/">Passive OS fingerprinting</a> has been added to
the netfilter code.

<p>
<li>
The FAT filesystem has added an "errors" mount option which governs its
behavior in the presence of critical errors.

<p>
<li>
The s390 architecture has added support for hibernation.

<p>
<li>
Support has been added for USB 3.0/xHCI host controllers, though none are yet
available. 

<p>
<li>
Kernel modesetting for the radeon driver, supporting R1XX, R2XX, R3XX,
R4XX, R5XX, and radeon up to X1950 hardware, has been merged.

<p>
<li> There is the usual pile of new drivers:

     DaVinci Ethernet MACs, Phillips SJA1000 CAN 
     controllers, Kvaser PCIcanx and Kvaser PCIcan PCI CAN Cards, Intel
     wireless Multicomm 3200 devices,  Micrel KS8842 ethernet switches.
     <p>

     	  and WM8960 codecs,
	  Digigram LX6464ES boards,
	  ESI Maya44 boards,

     THS7303 video amplifiers,  Analog Devices I2C bus based ADV7343
     encoders.
     </ul>

</ul>

<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> There is a new atomic function:
<p>
<pre>
    int atomic_dec_and_mutex_lock(atomic_t *cnt, struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>
     This function will decrement <tt>cnt</tt> and, if <tt>cnt</tt> reaches
     zero, it will acquire the given <tt>lock</tt>.
<p>

<li> A number of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/333620/">block layer request
     queue API changes</a> have been merged; all drivers must now dequeue
     requests before executing them.  Beyond that, the merging of the
     storage topology patches (in preparation for 4K-sector disks) mean
     that block drivers must now distinguish between the physical block
     size on the disk and the logical block size used by the kernel.
    
<p>
<li> The 32-bit x86 architecture now supports the <tt>atomic64_t</tt>
     type. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/187979/">kernel memory leak
     detector</a> has been merged at last.
<p>
<li> The fsnotify backend has been merged.  This code provides a new,
     common implementation for dnotify and inotify; it also will serve as
     the base for the "fanotify" code (formerly <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/295568/">TALPA</a>), which has not been
     merged as of this writing.
<p>
<li> Btrfs has seen a number of enhancements, including one which involves
     an on-disk format change.  Existing btrfs filesystems will work with
     the new code, but, once mounted on a 2.6.31 system, those filesystems
     will no longer work with older kernels.

<p>
<li> <a href="/Articles/305782/">Tree read-copy update</a> (RCU) is now the
default, though Classic RCU is still available.

<p> <li> Changes to the <tt>include/asm-generic</tt> header files were
merged.  These changes are meant to serve as a model for or be used
directly by new architectures
rather than copying from an existing architecture.  The S+core (score)
architecture 
depends on these changes and the MicroBlaze architecture will be using them
to clean up its ABI.

<p>
<li>
Some rather large cleanups for XFS were merged, including switching to the
generic POSIX ACL code and removal of the <tt>xfs_qmops</tt> quota ops
function vector.

<p>
<li>
All network drivers have converted to the new net_device_ops API and the
old API available with COMPAT_NET_DEV_OPS has been removed.

<p>
<li>
The rfkill core has been rewritten for devices that implement a way to stop
all radio transmission from the device (in response to a laptop key for
turning off wireless, for example).  Various drivers have also been updated
to use the new rfkill API.

<p>
<li>
Debugfs has had all of its references throughout the tree turned into
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/</tt> in both documentation and code.  In addition,
LWN's <a href="/Articles/334546/">updated guide to debugfs</a> was added to
the Documentation directory.

<p>
<li>
Unicode handling in the kernel has been updated, with functions like
<tt>utf_mbstowcs()</tt> being renamed to <tt>utf8s_to_utf16s()</tt> for
better readability.

<p>
<li>
The kmemcheck kernel memory checker to detect the use of uninitialized
memory has been merged.

<p>
<li>
The TTM GPU memory manager (<a href="/Articles/283793/">covered</a> a bit
over a year ago) has been merged.

</ul>
<p>
Linus started merging patches on June 10, suggesting that the merge window
will remain open until sometime around June 24.  That puts us roughly half
way through the merge window, in terms of time.  The merge rate will likely
slow down some for the remainder of the merge window, but there are,
undoubtedly, more interesting changes to come.  Stay tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I suppose this is so a mainframe can go to sleep when you open a maintenance door instead of close its lid.

Damnit.  Not only did you beat me to the joke, you did almost exactly the same one I was gonna do.<br>
<p>
No, wait:<br>
<p>
"So that when you close the lid on your mainframe, it takes less power while it's asleep." <br>

:-)<br>

I do wonder, though: why do 390 arch machines need to hibernate?   Or is this for things like native virtualization...<br>

I like the cuse thing - the walls between microkernel and monolithic are starting to come down, and people can put things in user or kernel space as they make sense.  Now we just need to be able to handle IRQs and DMA in userspace drivers.<br>

Interesting that TTM is being merged - I thought it was on the way out.<br>

TTM's API was found to be inadequate for the Intel hackers. But the functional guts of it were still desired by the hackers working on ATI and nV hardware. So the resolution as I understand it is TTM's code lives on, but the API now resembles what was desired by Intel.<br>

Yay for CUSE! Now we will finally be able to get perfect OSS emulation through the standard ALSA/dmix/Pulseaudio/JACK plugin chains. It's not as important as it was a year or more ago, but there are still plenty of old games and emulators that only support OSS, or have buggy (not compatible with PA/JACK/dmix) ALSA support but also support OSS.<br>

If kernel is recompiled without OSS emulation support, CUSE and ossp will work (otherwise a device number is reserved). However emulation will still not be perfect (impossible to match latency of direct writes to sound card buffers while OSS API doesn't do adequate latency information feedback to the application), but at least I expect it to work better with some old and/or proprietary apps than current userspace emulation.<br>

Don't get me wrong but so far this seems like the most boring kernel release in the last 2-3 years. With the exception of TTM and ATI KMS most of the changes look like internal reorganization. Lets see whats coming next week.<br>

Also whats happening in rt land ?? What about threaded interrupt handlers or preemptible spinlocks ??<br>

      <p>Real-world programs (Acrobat Reader, Quake, Skype, etc) <b>do</b>

So you have an old sound card somewhere that CUSE helps in some way when used with certain proprietary software. <br>
<p>
Sure, some things are more boring than others. But just because you've found something, contrived as it may be, to get excited about does not mean it's exciting to others.<br>
<p>
I'm not taking a position as to whether this kernel is shaping up to be "boring" or not.  To me it's just another kernel development cycle. One of many in a long line of them. It's the cumulative progress that matters.<br>

If a read is interrupted by a signal, then it is cut short.  So if an application was reading from /dev/zero but not prepared to handle a short read, then it could break with the newer kernel.<br>

The API semantics can make up part of the ABI.<br>
<p>
As an example, most people would consider changing the open() system call to return a random integer to be an ABI break.  With such a change, the system call would still be take the same arguments and have the same return type so the change is arguably one of semantics.<br>

      Never mind API semantics.  It's an ABI semantic change.
<p>
The only difference between an API and an ABI is that the API applies to source code and the ABI applies to the executable ("binary", e.g. ELF file).
<p>
An API change means that source code that used to be able to expect a certain behavior, once compiled and run, can't anymore.
<p>
An ABI change means that an executable that used to be able to expect a certain behavior when run, can't anymore.
<p>
The behavioral change might be that the program used to run and now won't even start because the format of the ELF header changed, but it might also be that the kernel returns half the requested data for a read() where it returned all of it before.

BPF is an increasingly capable tool for instrumenting and tracing the
operation of the kernel; it has enabled the creation of the growing set of
BCC tools.  Unfortunately, BCC has no support for a cross-development
workflow where the development machine and the target machine running the
developed code are different. Cross-development is favored by
embedded-systems kernel developers who tend to develop on an x86 host and
then flash and test their code on SoCs (System on Chips) based on the ARM
architecture.  In this article, I introduce BPFd, a project to enable cross-development using BPF and BCC.

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/README.md">BPF
compiler collection (BCC)</a> is a suite of kernel tracing tools that allow
systems engineers 
to efficiently and safely get a deep understanding into the inner workings
of a Linux system. Because they can't crash the kernel, they are safer than
kernel modules and can be used in production. <a
href="http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html">Brendan Gregg has written</a>
several nice tools, and has given talks showing the full power of eBPF-based tools; see also <a href="/Articles/742082/">this introduction to
BCC</a> published on LWN.

<p>In the Android kernel team, we work mostly on ARM64 systems, since most
Android devices use this architecture. BCC tools support on ARM64
systems has been broken for years. One of the reasons for this difficulty
is with ARM64 inline assembler statements. Unavoidably, kernel-header
includes in BCC tools result in the inclusion of architecture-specific
headers which, in the case
of ARM64, has the potential to spew inline ARM64 assembly instructions <a
href="https://www.mail-archive.com/iovisor-dev@lists.iovisor.org/msg00299.html">causing
major pains</a> to LLVM's BPF backend. Recently, this issue was fixed by
adding BPF
inline assembly support to the compiler (these <a
href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/2865ab6996164e7854d55c9e21c065fad7c26569">LLVM</a>
<a
href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/a6b7d22c2e64f44e6c74ad7e5ce5670f5ae72da3">commits</a>)
and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/1202">folks could
finally run BCC tools on ARM64</a>, but that turns out to not be the only
problem. 

<p>In order for BCC tools to work at all, they need kernel sources. This is
because most tools need to register callbacks on the ever-changing kernel
API in order to get their data. Such callbacks are registered using the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/132196/">kprobe</a> infrastructure. When a
BCC tool is run, BCC switches its current directory into the kernel source
directory before compilation starts, then compiles the C program that
embodies the BCC tool's logic. The C program is free to include kernel
headers for <tt>kprobes</tt> to work and to use kernel data structures.

<p>Even if one were not to use <tt>kprobes</tt>, BCC also implicitly adds a
common <tt>helpers.h</tt> include directive whenever an eBPF C program is
being compiled; that file is found in <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/cc/export/helpers.h"><tt>src/cc/export/helpers.h</tt></a>
in the BCC source. This  header uses the
<tt>LINUX_VERSION_CODE</tt> macro to create a "version" section
in the compiled output. <tt>LINUX_VERSION_CODE</tt> is available only in
the source of the specific kernel being targeted; it is used during eBPF
program loading to make sure the BPF program is being loaded into a kernel
with the right version. As you can see, kernel sources quickly become
mandatory for compiling eBPF programs.

<p>In some sense this build process is similar to how external kernel
modules are built. Kernel sources are large in size and often can take up a
large amount of space on the system being debugged. They can also get out
of sync, which may make the tools misbehave.

<p>The other issue is that the Clang and LLVM libraries need to be
available on the 
target being traced because the tools compile the needed BPF
bytecode, which is then loaded into the kernel. These libraries take up a
lot space. It seems overkill that you need a full-blown compiler
infrastructure on a system when the BPF code can be compiled elsewhere and
maybe even compiled just once. Further, these libraries need to be
cross-compiled to run on the architecture you're tracing. That's possible,
but why would anyone want to do that if they didn't need to?
Cross-compiling compiler toolchains can be tedious and stressful.


<p>Instead of loading up all the tools, compiler infrastructure and kernel
sources onto the remote targets being traced and running BCC that way, I
decided to write <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd">a proxy
program named BPFd</a>  that receives commands and
performs them on behalf of whoever is requesting them. All the heavy
lifting (compilation, parsing of user input, parsing of the hash maps,
presentation of results, etc.) is done by BCC tools on the host machine, with
BPFd running on the target as the interface to the target
kernel. BPFd encapsulates all the needs of BCC and performs them; this
includes loading a BPF program, creating, deleting and looking up maps,
attaching an eBPF program to a kprobe, polling for new data that the eBPF
program may have written into a perf buffer, etc. If it's woken up because
the perf buffer contains new data, it'll inform BCC tools on the host about
it, or it can return map data whenever requested, which may contain
information updated by the target eBPF program.

<h4>Simple design</h4>

<p>Before this work, the BCC tools architecture was as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/bcc-arch.png" alt="BCC architecture" class="photo" />
</blockquote>

<p>BPFd-based invocations partition this architecture, thus making it
possible to do 
cross-development and execution of the tools across machine and
architecture boundaries. For instance, the kernel sources that the BCC tools
depend on can be on a development machine, with eBPF code being loaded onto
a remote machine. This partitioning is illustrated in the following diagram:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/bcc-with-bpfd-arch.png" alt="BCC architecture with
bpfd" class="photo" /> 
</blockquote>

<p>The design of BPFd is quite simple, it expects commands on
<tt>stdin</tt> (standard input) and provides the results over
<tt>stdout</tt> (standard output). Every command is a single line no
matter how big the command is. This allows easy testing using <tt>cat</tt>,
since one could simply <tt>cat</tt> a file with commands, and check if
BPFd's <tt>stdout</tt> contains the expected results. Results from a
command, however can be multiple lines.

<p> BPF maps are data structures that a BPF program uses to store data,
which can be retrieved at a later time. Maps are represented by a file
descriptor returned by the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call once the map has been
successfully created.
For example, the following is a command to BPFd for creating a BPF
hash-table map:

<pre>
    BPF_CREATE_MAP 1 count 8 40 10240 0
</pre>

<p>And the result from BPFd is:

<pre>
    bpf_create_map: ret=3
</pre>

<p>

Since BPFd is proxying the map creation, the file descriptor (3 in this
example) is mapped into BPFd's file descriptor table.
The command tells BPFd to create a map named <tt>count</tt> with map
type&nbsp;1 (a hash table), with a key size of eight bytes and a value size
of 40, a maximum of 10240 
entries, and no special flags. In response, BPFd created a map which is
identified by file descriptor&nbsp;3.

<p>With the standard-input/output design, it's possible to write
wrappers around BPFd to handle more advanced communication methods such as
USB or networking. As a part of my analysis work in the Android kernel
team, I am communicating these commands over the <a
href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android
Debug Bridge (adb)</a>, which interfaces with the target device over either
USB or TCP/IP. I have shared several demos below.

<h4>Changes to BCC tools</h4>

A number of changes have been made to the BCC tools repository to enable it
to work with BPFd; some of the more significant changes are described here.
These changes can be found in <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd">this branch</a> of
the BPFd repository.

<p>A new <tt>remotes</tt> module has been added to BCC tools with an
abstraction that different remote access types, such as networking or USB, must
implement. This keeps code duplication to a minimum. By implementing <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/blob/bcc-bpfd/src/python/bcc/remote/base.py">the
functions needed</a> for a remote, a new communication method can be easily
added. Currently an <tt>adb</tt> remote and a <tt>process</tt> remote are
provided. The <tt>adb</tt> remote is for communication with the target
device over USB or TCP/IP using the Android
Debug Bridge. With the <tt>process</tt> remote, which is probably just useful
for local testing, BPFd is forked on the same
machine running BCC and communicates with it over <tt>stdin</tt> and
<tt>stdout</tt>.

<p><a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/cc/libbpf.c"><tt>libbpf.c</tt></a>  
is the main C file in the BCC project that talks to the kernel for all
things BPF.  This is illustrated in the diagram above. In order to make BCC
perform BPF operations on the remote machine instead of the local machine,
the parts of BCC that make calls to the local <tt>libbpf.c</tt> are now instead
channeled to the remote BPFd on the target. BPFd on the target then performs
the commands on behalf of BCC running locally, by calling into its copy of
<tt>libbpf.c</tt>.

<p>One of the tricky parts to making this work is that certain other paths
need to be channeled to the remote machine as well. For example, to attach
to a tracepoint, BCC needs a list of all available tracepoints on the
system. This list has to be obtained on the remote system and is the 
reason for the <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/src/bpfd.c#L421">GET_TRACE_EVENTS</a>
command in BPFd.

<p>When BCC compiles the C program encapsulated in a BCC tool into eBPF
instructions, it assumes that the eBPF program will run on the same
processor architecture that BCC is running on. This is incorrect
when building an eBPF program for a different target.

Some time ago, before I started this project, I <a
href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9961801/">changed this
assumption</a> for the 
building of in-kernel eBPF samples (which are simple standalone samples
and unrelated to BCC). Now, I have had to <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/commit/2a2f9d41c336d8aa058338ae536bd93d31dbb1ef">make
a similar change</a> to BCC so that it compiles the C program correctly for
the target architecture.


<h4>Installation and running</h4>

<p>To try it out for yourself,  follow the <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md#diy">detailed</a>
or <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md">simple</a>
instructions. Also, apply this <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelagnel/bpfd/master/patches/kernel/0001-bpf-stackmap-Implement-bpf_get_next_key.patch">kernel
patch</a> (currently submitted upstream) to make it faster to run tools
like <tt>offcputime</tt>. 

<p>
As an example, consider <tt>filetop</tt>, which is a BCC tool that shows
you all read/write I/O 
operations with a similar experience to the <tt>top</tt> tool.  It
refreshes every few seconds, giving you a live view of these operations.
To run <tt>filetop</tt> remotely with BPFd, start by 
going to your BCC directory and setting the environment variables needed.
Something like the following will do:

<pre>
    export ARCH=arm64
    export BCC_KERNEL_SOURCE=/home/joel/sdb/hikey-kernel/
    export BCC_REMOTE=adb
</pre>

<p>You could also use the <tt>bcc-set</tt> script provided in the BPFd
sources to set these environment variables for you.  Check the <a
href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a>
file in BPFd sources for more information.

<p>Next, start <tt>filetop</tt>:

<pre>
    # ./tools/filetop.py 5
</pre>

<p>This tells the tool to monitor file I/O every 5 seconds.
While <tt>filetop</tt> was running, I started the stock email app in
Android and the output looked like:

<pre>
    Tracing... Output every 5 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end

    3792   m.android.email  66     0      2       0       R framework-res.apk
</pre>

<p>Note the <tt>Email.apk</tt> file being read by Android to load the email
application, and then various other reads happening related to the email
app. Finally, <tt>WifiService</tt> continuously reads
<tt>iface_state_fmt</tt> to get network statistics for Android accounting.


<p>
<h4>Other use cases for BPFd</h4>

<p>While the main use case at the moment is easier use of BCC tools in
cross-development situations, another potential use case that's gaining interest
is easy loading of a BPF program locally. The BPFd code can be stored on disk in
base64 format and sent to <tt>bpfd</tt> using something as simple as:

<pre>
    # cat my_bpf_prog.base64 | bpfd
</pre>

<p>In the Android kernel team, we are also experimenting with  loading a
program with a forked BPFd instance,
creating maps, pinning them for use at a later time once BPFd
exits, and then killing the BPFd fork, since it's done. Creating a separate
process and having it load the eBPF program for you has
the distinct advantage that the <a
href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/samples/bpf/bpf_load.c#L546">runtime-fixing
up of map file descriptors</a> isn't needed in the loaded eBPF code.
In other words, the eBPF program's instructions can be
pre-determined and statically loaded.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>


Building code for instrumentation on a different machine than the one
actually running the debugging code is beneficial; BPFd makes this
possible.  Alternately, one could also write tracing code in their own
kernel module on a development machine, copy it over to a remote target,
and do similar tracing/debugging.  However, this is quite unsafe since
kernel modules can crash the kernel. On the other hand, eBPF programs are
verified before they're run and are guaranteed to be safe when loaded into
the kernel, unlike kernel modules.  Furthermore, the BCC project offers
great support for parsing the output of maps, processing them, and
presenting results, all using the friendly Python programming language. BCC
tools are quite promising and could be the future for easier and safer
deep-tracing endeavors. BPFd can hopefully make it even easier to run
these tools for folks such as embedded system and Android developers who
typically compile their kernels on their local machine and run them on a
non-local target machine.

Great work, Joel!<br>
<p>
Can BPFd support ssh connection? If it can support ethernet/ssh connection, I'd like give a try with debian on Hikey :)<br>

Without having looked at the code yet...<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; With the process remote, which is probably just useful for local testing, BPFd is forked on the same machine running BCC and communicates with it over stdin and stdout.</font><br>
<p>
...it sounds like this could be done by extending the ‘process’ remote to do something like fork “ssh targethost bpfd” instead. It might be configurable to do that already.<br>

Yes, its quite extensible so you can absolutely add a new 'ssh' remote to do that. Check how I did it for adb: <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd/src/python/bcc/remote/adb.py">https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd/src/python...</a><br>

I created an issue here for this:<br>

I see that there's an lldb-server:  <br>
<p>
<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/remote.html">http://lldb.llvm.org/remote.html</a><br>
<p>
That seem to be the back-end of interest fot those of us not rinning Android on the remote target, but given a well-specofied protocol, perhaps it's just as easy to get gdbserver working?  The task is to teach the server how to emit the libbpf commands.<br>

BPFd is not restricted to Android though. Further things not in libbpf may need to be performed as well on the remote side. Also its much simpler than LLDB ;-)<br>

It seems an extra effort and trying to fit something into LLDB or gdb-server, to do something that isn't supposed to. We're not remotely debugging a target process, not sure how well it really fits into a remote debugger model. Instead of that, you could consider contributing to BPFd and making it better ;D<br>

This is very cool. Happy to see efforts being done to get BPF running cross-platform. Architecture "independence" is one of the features that I liked of the ktap proposal (<a href="https://github.com/ktap/ktap">https://github.com/ktap/ktap</a>).<br>
<p>
I glanced over the code quickly looking for logging and only found this "/* TODO: logging disabled for now, add mechanism in future */". Any plans on leaving traces in /data of the BPF operations conducted remotely? This might have some value. Also, any chance of having local cache or already compiled scripts that could be run locally on the target? I can see the value of being able to leverage existing script sets locally while the device has already shipped and is no longer connected to a development system.<br>

Yes, this is something that we should do.<br>

<p>
Yes, that could be done by enabling debugging (BCC_REMOTE_DEBUG) on the BCC side and getting the commands. Then inputting the commands to BPFd on the target. The issue though then is the presentation layer. Without BCC running on the host side, you can't interpret the maps and output data unless the target was running BCC itself. But yes, one could perform the loader functionality of eBPF just by purely using BPFd without any need for BCC (I mentioned this with an example in the article)<br>

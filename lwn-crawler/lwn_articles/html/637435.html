<p>
In a filesystem session at the 2015 LSFMM Summit, Jason Baron led a
discussion about the <tt>epoll()</tt> system call.  He and others have <a
href="/Articles/633422/">observed some performance problems with
<tt>epoll()</tt></a>, 
especially for large sets of monitored file descriptors.
There are two problems that Baron is trying to address: the "thundering
herd" problem on wakeups and the use of global locks when manipulating the
<tt>epoll()</tt> sets.  He has posted patches for both, but they haven't
really been commented on, he said.  He also noted that Fam Zheng has posted some
patches that add new system calls for <tt>epoll()</tt>.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The thundering herd problem occurs when there are multiple threads that
share a wakeup source in their <tt>epoll()</tt> sets.  When that file
descriptor becomes ready, <i>all</i> of the threads waiting wake up, even
though only one of them is needed to service the event.  One solution that
had been suggested was to have a single <tt>epoll()</tt> queue, with all
events being taken off that single queue.  But that is not optimal for what he
is trying to do, he said.
</p>

<p>
His patches simply wakeup the first idle thread that is waiting, then
round-robin through the threads on subsequent wakeups.  Some suggested
using CPU affinity to wake up the thread on the CPU where the interrupt has
come in.  But <tt>epoll()</tt> doesn't currently have access to that kind
of information.  Baron has "heard vaguely" that some people are doing this, but
he hasn't seen any patches.  He would like to explore the idea further.
</p>

<p>
His initial proposal was to simply wake up one thread waiting on the
<tt>epoll()</tt> set, but there was concern that might break programs that
were expecting the current behavior.  The wait queue used is associated
with a file descriptor, so it is local to the process (and its threads),
rather than global.  A flag passed to <tt>epoll()</tt> could change
the behavior for a program without affecting other programs that might also
be waiting.
</p>

<p>
Another option that he has tried is to change the wakeup behavior in the
scheduler, though he was worried that the scheduler developers would be
unhappy with a change like that.  When he posted it, though, there was no
feedback of that sort. Still, avoiding changes to the wakeup code is desirable.
</p>

<p>
But <tt>epoll()</tt> has the ability to nest the file descriptors it is
monitoring.  That means a set of file descriptors can be constructed that
contains descriptors returned from other <tt>epoll_create1()</tt> calls.
In the past, loops could be created that way, though that has been
fixed.  One could use the nesting capability, coupled with a new flag to
<tt>epoll_create1()</tt> to add the round-robin feature, but restrict
the changes to the <tt>epoll()</tt> code instead of changing the wakeup code.
</p>

<p>
Jeff Layton asked if there would be two flags, one to request
the CPU affinity mode and one for the round-robin behavior.  But Baron did
not think both would be needed.  The CPU affinity mode could simply fall
back to round-robin behavior if the interrupt did not come in on a CPU
that was running a thread waiting on the event.
</p>

<p>
He moved on to locking, which has shown up in some profiles of
<tt>epoll()</tt> performance.  Akamai (where Baron works) has not
necessarily run into it, but people don't like global locks, in general, he
said.  Part of the problem is that the kernel does not know when the sets
have file descriptors in common, so it locks everything when manipulating them.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to break up the locks in the classic way, he said, so that
operations are serialized only for sets with common file descriptors.   He posted patches a
few months ago, but they added three pointer fields to
<tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt>, which was 
not something other developers were happy with.  He plans to switch to only
adding a single pointer that points to a structure to hold anything that <tt>epoll()</tt>
needs.  It would be allocated when the <tt>epoll()</tt> file descriptor is created.
</p>

<p>
In addition, his patches eliminate the runtime checking for
loops and too deep of nesting in the file descriptor sets.  Right now
those checks are done when calling <tt>epoll_wait()</tt>, but his patches
do that checking when file descriptors are added to the set in <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Layton asked if all of this work meant that Baron was volunteering to be
the <tt>epoll()</tt> maintainer.  Baron was non-committal, but Chris Mason
suggested (with a chuckle) that if these patches were accepted, that would
more or less happen 
by default.
</p>

<p>
Mason said that Facebook is hitting some of these problems, as is Google.
Someone said that GlusterFS is hitting them too.  Baron said that Akamai
would be using his patches in production, so they should get lots of testing.
</p>

<p>
There are other <tt>epoll()</tt> patches out there, including those for new
system calls from Zheng.  Others include a patch that would add a lockless
way to  enqueue and dequeue events 
and one that would optimistically wait (briefly) in the kernel for another event
rather than immediately go to sleep.  The person working on the latter
patches, which were targeted at networking, is now working on other things,
Matthew Wilcox said, so they could be taken over by someone else if that
was of interest.
</p>

<p>
It would seem that scalability problems with <tt>epoll()</tt> are cropping
up in a number of places, so some fixes are needed. 
Baron's patches are not
running into much in the way of opposition, at least from the assembled
filesystem developers, which means they may make their way into the
mainline before long.

Waking one thread to avoid thundering herds is easily doable in user space without any change to epoll(). <br>
<p>
One just needs an additional waker thread that is in charge of "epolling" the file descriptor and, once the descriptor gets ready, apply any application-specific policy to chose which threads need to wake up. This scheme is not only simple, but much more flexible and portable than anything we can do in the kernel.<br>

And this requires at least two additional switches which kinda makes it less useful.<br>

3 is fairly good. It's O(1) instead of O(N) with the naive algorithm (let all threads epoll() the same descriptor). <br>
<p>
It means that you don't need to mess with the kernel until thread switching  dominates the cost, and in that case you should not be using threads to start with, but something lighter.<br>

The only case I can think of where you might want to poll on the same descriptor from multiple threads, and _without_ using EPOLLONESHOT, is on socket acceptance. But that was solved by the SO_REUSEPORT patch in 2013, which enqueues incoming connections with a specific thread.<br>
<p>
Multi-thread polling without EPOLLONESHOT is problematic because of race conditions on socket close. Mutexes don't help. You need to introduce a quiescent period, where you can prove that all threads have woken up at least once since you closed the socket before destroying the underlying data structure in your application. I've never seen any application or event loop do this. It's not much of a problem for listening sockets because those tend to be global and persistent throughout the application life-time.<br>
<p>
Given the above, I don't see the need for any new flags to be added to epoll_create. Specifically, the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag which was discussed in an earlier thread and is [presumably] the context of the current article. Just fix EPOLLONESHOT to behave like EPOLLEXCLUSIVE. Arguably the round-robin behavior should be the default too in such a case. Round-robin doesn't make any sense _except_ in the case of EPOLLONESHOT. And if you wanted to pin a connection to a specific thread, you wouldn't be using a shared epoll queue to begin with.<br>

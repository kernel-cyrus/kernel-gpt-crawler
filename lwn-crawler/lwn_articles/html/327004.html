<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 8, 2009</br>
           </div>
There have been some 3400 non-merge changesets incorporated into the
mainline since <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325921/">last week's
update</a>, for a total of some 9600 changes merged for 2.6.30 overall.  At
this point, the 2.6.30 merge window is complete. 
User-visible changes merged since last week include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <tt>preadv()</tt> and <tt>pwritev()</tt> system calls have been
     added.  They have been long in coming; LWN first <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/164887/">covered these system
     calls</a> in 2005.  The expected user-space interface will be:
<p>
<pre>
      ssize_t preadv(int d, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt, off_t offset);
      ssize_t pwritev(int d, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt, off_t offset);
</pre>
<p>
     Due to the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/311630/">portability
     challenges</a> involved, though, the actual kernel interface (seen
     only by the C library) is somewhat different.
<p>

<li> The loop block driver supports a new <tt>ioctl()</tt>
     (<tt>LOOP_SET_CAPACITY</tt>) which can be used to change the size of
     the device on the fly.
<p>
<li> The <tt>eventfd()</tt> system call takes a new flag
     (<tt>EFD_SEMAPHORE</tt>) which causes it to implement simple
     counting-semaphore behavior.  See <a
     href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.commits.head/188038">the
     changelog entry</a> for a description of how this works.
<p>
<li> The ext4 system is now more careful about forcing data out to disk in
     situations where small files have been truncated or renamed.  This
     behavior increases robustness in the face of crashes, but it can also
     have a performance cost.  There is a new mount option
     (<tt>auto_da_alloc</tt>) which can be used to disable this behavior.
     Also new for ext4 is a set of control knobs found under
     <tt>/sys/fs/ext4</tt>. 
<p>
<li> The ext3 filesystem, too, is more careful to flush data to disk when
     running in the <tt>data=writeback</tt> mode.
<p>
<li> The default mode for ext3 has been changed from <tt>data=ordered</tt>
     to <tt>data=writeback</tt>.  The latter performs quite a bit better in
     2.6.30, but also carries an information disclosure risk if the system
     crashes.  Distributors can change the default mode when they configure
     their kernels; some may well choose to retain the older
     <tt>data=ordered</tt> default.

<p>
<li> The btrfs filesystem has also been changed to be careful about
     flushing data to disk after truncate or rename operations.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://www.nilfs.org/en/">Nilfs</a> log-structured
     filesystem has been merged.
<p>
<li> The MD RAID layer now has support for <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/290141/">block-layer integrity
     checking</a>.  MD can also change chunk_size and layout in a reshape
     operation - a capability which makes it possible to turn a RAID5 array
     into RAID6 while it is running.
<p>
<li> The exofs (formerly osdfs) filesystem, providing <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/305740/">support for object storage
     devices</a>, has been merged.
<p>
<li> FS-Cache (formerly cachefs) has been merged.  This subsystem (first <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/100321/">covered here</a> in 2004),
     provides a local caching layer for network filesystems; it has finally
     overcome <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/312708/">the concerns
     expressed by some developers</a> and made it into the mainline.

<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/246272/">distributed storage</a>
     subsystem and pohmelfs network filesystem have been merged.
     Interestingly, this code went in via the -staging tree.
<p>
<li> The ATA subsystem has gained support for the TRIM command.
<p>
<li> There are two new tuning knobs under <tt>/proc/sys/vm</tt> 
     (<tt>nr_pdflush_threads_min</tt> and <tt>nr_pdflush_threads_max</tt>);
     they place limits on the number of running pdflush
     threads in the system.
<p>
<li> Multiple message queue namespaces are now supported.
<p>
<li> The PA-RISC architecture has gained support for ftrace and
     latencytop. 
<p>
<li> The ARM architecture now has high memory support, for all of you out
     there with 2GB ARM-based systems.
<p>
<li> The Xtensa architecture now supports systems without a memory
     management unit.
<p>
<li> New device drivers:
     <p>
     <ul>

     <li> <b>Block</b>: Marvell MMC/SD/SDIO host drivers.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Graphics</b>: Samsung S3C framebuffers.

     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>: National Semiconductor LM95241 sensor chips,

				ASUS ATK0110 ACPI hardware monitoring
     				interfaces.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Networking</b>: Neterion X3100 Series 10GbE PCIe server adapters.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Processors and systems</b>: Tensilica S6000 processors and 
     	  		     S6105 IP camera reference design kits, and
			     Merisc AVR32-based boards.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Sound</b>: HTC Magician audio devices.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Video</b>: i.MX1/i.MXL CMOS sensor interfaces,
     	  		Conexant cx231xx USB video capture devices, and
			Legend Silicon LGS8913/LGS8GL5/LGS8GXX DMB-TH
     			demodulators.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Staging drivers</b> (those not considered ready for regular 
     	  mainline inclusion): stlc4550 and stlc4560 wireless chipsets,
	  Brontes PCI frame grabbers,
	  ATEN 2011 USB to serial adapters,
	  Phison PS5000 IDE adapters,
	  Plan 9 style capability pseudo-devices,
	  Intel Management Engine Interfaces,
	  Line6 PODxt Pro audio devices,
	  USB Quatech ESU-100 8 port serial devices,
	  Ralink RT3070 wireless network adapters,
	  and a vast array of COMEDI data acquisition drivers.
     </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include: 
<p>
<ul>

<li> There is a new memory debug tool controlled by the PAGE_POISONING
     configuration variable.  Turning this feature on causes a pattern to
     be written to all freed pages and checked at allocation time.  The
     result is "a large slowdown," but also the potential to catch a number
     of use-after-free errors.
<p>
<li> The new function:
<p>
<pre>
    int pci_enable_msi_block(struct pci_dev *dev, int count);
</pre>
<p>
     allows a driver to enable a block of MSI interrupts.

<p>
<li> As part of the FS-Cache work, the "slow work" thread pool mechanism
     has been merged.  Some have expressed the hope that it would become
     the One True Kernel Thread Pool, but there seems to be little progress
     in that direction.  See <a
     href="/Articles/327186/">Documentation/slow-work.txt</a> for more
     information. 
<p>
<li> There is a pair of new printing functions:
<p>
<pre>
     int vbin_printf(u32 *bin_buf, size_t size, const char *fmt, ...);
     int bstr_printf(char *buf, size_t size, const char *fmt, 
                     const u32 *bin_buf);
</pre>
<p>
     The difference here is that <tt>vbin_printf()</tt> places the binary
     value of its arguments into <tt>bin_buf</tt>.  The process can be
     reversed with <tt>bstr_printf()</tt>, which formats a string from the
     given binary buffer.  The main use for these functions would appear to
     be with Ftrace; they allow the encoding of values to be deferred until
     a given trace string is read by user space.
<p>

<li> Also added is <tt>printk_once()</tt>, which only prints its message
     the first time it is executed.
<p>
<li> The "kmemtrace" tracing facility has been merged.  Kmemtrace provides
     data on how the core slab allocations function.  See <a
     href="/Articles/327579/">Documentation/vm/kmemtrace.txt</a> for
     details. 
<p>
<li> A number of ftrace changes have been merged.  There is a workqueue
     tracer which tracks the operations of workqueue threads.  The blktrace
     block subsystem tracer can now be used via ftrace.  The new "event"
     tracer allows a user to turn on specific tracepoints within the
     kernel; tracepoints have been added for various scheduler and
     interrupt events.  "Raw" events (with binary-formatted data) are
     available now.  The new "syscall" tracer is for tracing system calls.

</ul>
<p>
The merge window is now closed, and the stabilization process can begin.
Past experience suggests that something close to 3000 more changes will
find their way into the mainline before the 2.6.30 release, which can be
expected to happen sometime in June.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Yes, data=writeback was made the "default default."  Obviously different sentences were written at different times...

      These were part of the original Opteron platform in 2002 - what's actually been added is <a href="http://bluesmoke.sourceforge.net/">Error Detection and Correction (EDAC)</a> support for these chipsets. Similarly the PPC4xx IBM DDR2 memory controller driver added is for EDAC.

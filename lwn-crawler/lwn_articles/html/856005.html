<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 13, 2021</br>
           </div>
The kernel's <a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> virtual machine allows
programs loaded from user space to be safely run in the kernel's context.
That functionality would be of limited use, however, without the ability
for those programs to interact with the rest of the kernel.  The interface
between BPF and the kernel has been kept narrow for a number of good
reasons, including safety and keeping the kernel in control of the system.
The 5.13 kernel, though, contains a feature that could, over 
time, widen that interface considerably: the ability to directly call
kernel functions from BPF programs.
<p>
The immediate driver for this functionality is the implementation of
TCP congestion-control algorithms in BPF, a capability that was <a
href="/Articles/811631/">added to the 5.6 kernel release</a> by Martin
KaFai Lau.  Actual congestion-control implementations in BPF turned out to
reimplement a number of functions that already exist in the kernel,
which seems less than fully optimal; it would be better
to just use the existing functions in the kernel if possible.  The new
function-calling mechanism — also implemented by Lau — makes that possible.
<p>
<h4>Making functions available to BPF</h4>
<p>
On the BPF side, using a kernel function is now just a matter of
declaring it <tt>extern</tt> and calling it like any other
C&nbsp;function.  Within the kernel, instead, a bit more work has to be
done.  BPF programs are meant to only have access to a specific set of
allowed functions, and that set is only available to the intended BPF
program type; code 
inside the kernel must thus make those functions available in the right
context.  So, 
for example, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e78aea8b2170">this
commit</a> makes <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/net/ipv4/tcp_cong.c#L386"><tt>tcp_slow_start()</tt></a>
available to BPF — but only for congestion-control programs.
<p>
"Exporting" functions to BPF programs is done by adding a new function to
the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/include/linux/bpf.h#L461"><tt>bpf_verifier_ops</tt>
structure</a> associated with the program type:
<p>
<pre>
    bool (*check_kfunc_call)(u32 kfunc_btf_id);
</pre>
<p>
This function will be called by the BPF verifier when it encounters an
external call; <tt>kfunc_btf_id</tt> is the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html">BPF type
format (BTF)</a> ID assigned to the function that the BPF program wants to call.
The function should return true if the call should be allowed.  If
<tt>tcp_slow_start()</tt> were the only function to be made available in
this way, that function could be written as:
<p>
<pre>
    static bool bpf_tcp_ca_check_kfunc_call(u32 id)
    {
    	return id == BTF_ID(func, tcp_slow_start);
    }
</pre>
<p>
If there are many functions to export, there are easier ways than a long
list of <tt>if</tt> statements to do the checking; see the above-linked
commit for an example.
<p>
Beyond checking that the function is meant to be available, the BPF
verifier carries out a number of other checks.  For example, the arguments
passed to the function and their types must be correct, or the program
will be rejected.  The call is only allowed if the verifier can convince
itself that it is safe, though the verifier obviously cannot really know
what is going on inside the called function or the ways in which things
could go wrong.
<p>
<h4>Some questions</h4>
<p>
So far, congestion-control programs are the only program type to make use
of this 
feature, but it is not hard to imagine that others will come in the
future.  There are a number of interesting questions that are raised by
this capability and how it might be used going forward.
<p>
The first of those might be: how does this capability differ from the BPF
helper mechanism that has been part of BPF for years?  The changelog does not
address that question, so your editor has to guess.  BPF helper programs
must be written explicitly for use from BPF programs, must be declared
specially, and require a <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/include/linux/bpf.h#L333"><tt>bpf_func_proto</tt>
structure</a> to be filled in and made available to the verifier; see <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/kernel/bpf/helpers.c#L20">the
setup for <tt>bpf_map_lookup_elem()</tt></a> for an example.  Making an
existing kernel function available as a BPF helper means writing a wrapper
function, then going through this whole dance.
<p>
To make a kernel function callable, instead, is just a matter of defining 
a "check" function that allows the call to happen, and the BPF subsystem
does the rest.  One could argue that helpers should have been implemented
that way in the first place, but there is a lot of necessary infrastructure
that only showed up years after the helper mechanism was developed.
Without BTF, this would not be possible; the BPF Linux
security module (formerly <a href="/Articles/808048/">KRSI</a>) also
brought some of the necessary support.  Had that infrastructure existed at
the beginning, it's possible that there would never have been a need to add
BPF helpers.
<p>
That said, BPF helpers have the advantage of existing solely for use by BPF
programs; kernel functions are there to be called by the rest of the
kernel.  There is no stable ABI within the kernel, so it would not be
surprising to see the interface to BPF-exported kernel functions change
more often than the interface to BPF helpers.  The <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e6ac2450d6de">commit adding the
function-calling capability</a> makes a clear statement that there are no
ABI guarantees:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The white listed functions are not bounded to a fixed ABI contract.
	Those functions have already been used by the existing kernel
	tcp-cc.  If any of them has changed, both in-tree and out-of-tree
	kernel tcp-cc implementations have to be changed.
</blockquote>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens if an internal kernel change
breaks a high-profile BPF program and users start to complain.  It is
generally understood that functionality provided to BPF is not part of the
kernel ABI, but that policy has never been explicitly blessed by Linus
Torvalds or seriously tested.
<p>
BPF helpers are also designed to be safely called from the BPF context —
from outside of the kernel itself, in other words.  Regular kernel
functions are not written with a possibly hostile caller in mind.  The BPF
subsystem as a whole goes to great lengths to ensure that a BPF program
cannot crash or compromise the system, but that subsystem cannot know what
happens inside some kernel function and cannot guarantee that the arguments
to any given function call make sense.  If the wrong functions are made
available to BPF, an erroneous or hostile program could use them to make an
unpleasant mess.

<p>
Finally, this mechanism looks a bit like a backdoor way to export kernel
symbols outside of the kernel itself.  The exporting of symbols to modules
requires an <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</tt> declaration next to the relevant code and
often attracts a fair amount of attention and debate over whether kernel
internals should be exposed in that way.  Exporting of functions to BPF
programs is a lower-profile activity that can happen far away from the
definition of the functions involved.  In an extreme case, there does not
appear to be anything to prevent somebody from registering a checking
function like this:
<p>
<pre>
    static bool export_the_world(u32 kfunc_btf_id)
    {
    	return true;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The result of adding this function would be to make almost any kernel
function callable from a BPF program of the right type.  That is unlikely
to be seen as a good outcome.  In theory such a function would be caught in
review, but it is worth asking how many people have reviewed the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc1/source/net/bpf/test_run.c#L218">test
code</a> for function calls from BPF that has been added (as part of this patch
series) to the (entirely unrelated)
traffic-control classifier program type; this (harmless) code will be
present in all systems with traffic control enabled.  It does not seem that
it would be hard to add a severe bug, intentionally or otherwise, by
exporting the wrong function to BPF programs.
<p>
Some of these concerns could perhaps be mitigated by registering a list of
allowed kernel functions with the BPF core rather than supplying a function that
makes its own decisions.  That is not how this feature was implemented,
though. 
<p>
Be that as it may, the BPF function-calling mechanism has been merged and
will be included in the 5.13 release.  Presumably there will be enough
vigilance to keep kernel functions from being inappropriately exported in
the mainline kernel in future releases.  Properly managed, this feature
could be used to make a great deal of functionality available to BPF
programs, significantly growing the set of useful things that can be
done with BPF.  It will be interesting to see where this feature goes from
here.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Interesting news for me because I like BPF very much.<br>
Now BPF programs can call bpf helpers, plus some limited set of kernel functions that were approved by kernel maintainers deliberately.<br>
<p>
Like kprobe, the set of exported kernel functions won&#x27;t be stable or guaranteed. As kernel version bumps up, the list of exported functions will change. Some functions would be added, deleted, renamed or parameters of functions would be modified. BPF developers would get stressed out if they depend on this feature. Because there are problems to maintain their own programs when they have to support different versions of kernel. But I think most bleeding edges have cumbersome disadvantages like this. So I would rather see positive side of this feature and try it out.<br>

Might be interesting to have a &quot;disable BPF verifier&quot; option and let all kernel functions to be callable. This could then be used to spawn VMs for testing specific kernel subsystems using eBPF as a test engine without requiring any code additions to the kernel nor any kernel rebuilding.  Just build one kernel image and fire away at it with eBPF. I&#x27;d totally expect those VMs to continuously crash, but could be useful for generalized kernel unit testing.<br>
<p>
Don&#x27;t bother taking this too seriously. Just a quick idea that came to mind as I read this writeup.<br>

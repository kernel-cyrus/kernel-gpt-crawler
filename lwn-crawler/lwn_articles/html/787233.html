</div>
Since its inception, the DAX mechanism (which provides for direct access to
files stored on persistent memory) has been seen as somewhat experimental
and incomplete.  At the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, Dan Williams ran a session where he said that
perhaps the time has come to end that experiment.  Some of the
unimplemented DAX features may never actually need to be implemented, and
it might just be possible to declare DAX finished.  But first there are a
few more details to take care of.
<p>
He started with the general question of what DAX actually means; he defined
it as the mechanism that is used to bypass the page cache and map
persistent memory directly into user space.  There are obvious performance
advantages to doing this, but it causes problems as well: the virtual
address given to a page of data is also the address of the permanent

<a href="/Articles/787270/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/DanWilliams-sm.jpg" alt="[Dan Williams]"
title="Dan Williams" class="rthumb"></a>

storage for that data.  Many parts of the system were not designed with
that in mind, so various features have to be turned off when DAX is in use,
and others must be bypassed.  It gives the whole subsystem the feel of a
permanent experiment, and that makes people not want to use it.
<p>
Within the kernel, there are a few ways to know that DAX is involved with
any given memory mapping.  A call to <tt>vma_is_dax()</tt> is a way
of asking whether a given page is located in persistent storage.  Then,
there is <tt>vma_is_fsdax()</tt>, which is similar except it says that some
other agent could break that association at any time.  It is used to
prevent certain long-term mappings to DAX memory.  The
<tt>PTE_DEVMAP</tt> page-table flag notes that a given page's lifetime is
tied to that of an underlying device; users have to take extra references
to that device to keep it from going away.  Outside of the kernel, though,
there is only one sure indication that DAX is in use: the <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt>
flag to 
<tt>mmap()</tt>.  If a mapping operation with that flag fails, persistent
memory is not present.
<p>
What do we need to finish the experiment?  There are still some semantics
to figure out, Williams said.  There are a lot of applications that are not
interested in persistent memory at the level of performing individual
cache-flush operations, but they do want to know whether any given mapping
involves the page cache.  Jan Kara added that such applications are trying
to optimize the amount of memory they use; they tend to be programs like a
database manager that knows it has the system to itself.  If a given file
is mapped through ordinary memory, the application must allow for the
page cache and reduce its own memory use.  If DAX is available, the
application can use more memory for its own purposes.  Dave Hansen
suggested that what is really 
needed is a way to ask directly about the performance characteristics of a
memory mapping.
<p>
Williams continued by asking whether there might be a need for a
<tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> option that asks the kernel to minimize the use of the
page cache.  Filesystems offer both buffered and direct APIs, with the
latter avoiding the page cache; perhaps memory management should do the
same.  The problem is that these semantics might break with upcoming
filesystems like <a href="/Articles/729812/">NOVA</a>, which do not use the
page cache but also do not offer direct mappings.  Applications are often
not interested in the "direct" part, but they do care about page-cache
usage.
<p>
Michal Hocko jumped in with a different point of view: the real problem, he
said, is that the page cache simply sucks.  It is an implementation detail
in current kernels, but might well prove not to be a long-term concern.
Rather than adding new APIs to enable applications to get around the page
cache, we should just make caching work properly.  That would help to
eliminate a lot of nasty application code.  This suggestion, while
interesting, does not solve the short-term problem and so was set aside.
<p>
Getting back to DAX, Williams noted that there are a lot of features in the
kernel that are not implemented for the DAX case; many places in the code
read something like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (dax)
        goto fail;
</pre>
<p>
These include <a href="/Articles/784574/">long-term mappings with
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt></a>, which can pin down DAX pages indefinitely.
There are some problems with <tt>reflink()</tt> functionality, a problem that
was set aside for the filesystem track.
<p>
There are also problems with private mappings and DAX; pages created via
copy-on-write  
will end up in ordinary RAM rather than persistent memory, which may not be
what users want.  Some may prefer that these copies remain in cheaper
memory.  Hansen suggested that this problem could be solved
with NUMA policies.  Williams said that the right solution might be to call
back into the underlying filesystem to inform it of a copy-on-write fault
and make it allocate a new page to handle it; the filesystem would then have to
track those pages specially until they are released.  Kara said that he
didn't really see a use case for this feature, though.  Mel Gorman
described it as "difficult semantics and non-obvious behavior for a
non-existent use case".
<p>
Time for the session ran out about then.  Williams closed by saying that,
perhaps, it is not necessary to implement all of those APIs for the DAX
case until users scream about their absence.  That would allow the DAX
experiment to be declared done, more or less, for now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

DAX doesn't exist anyway. You simply can't get DAX devices unless you are a big company that is ready to sign tons of NDAs and build a SKIF to work on the devices (might be exaggerating about SKIF a bit).<br>

As a member of public, the most you can get are "emulators" - simple DRAMs with a battery backup.<br>

      Intel Optane DC persistent memory is supposed to be available next month, at around $900 for a 128G DIMM or $2700 for a 256G. Some retailers are taking preorders. No SCIF needed.  :-)

      <p>Multiple sticks doesn't help when you're DIMM slot limited, though - a single 128 GiB stick is still a lot more than the price of a single Optane 128 GiB stick.
<p>Also, for the sort of systems that can take Optane, you'd be using RDIMMs; a quick check shows that 128 GiB of RDIMM DDR-4 is around $800, and takes 4 slots of the typical 16 you have on a board. So Optane is cheaper than DRAM, but not by a huge amount.

It's an emulator, emulators can be faster than the real hardware. I was hoping for much more from Optane, but for now it appears to be just slightly cheaper than DRAM while being much slower.<br>

I think that it’s not an emulator in any respect. It’s not like Optane is somehow the real thing and battery-backed DRAM is pretending. The battery approach was also first.<br>
<p>
In some sense, Optane is an emulator. The DIMM protocol was designed to model the way that DRAM works.  I assume that Optane goes a bit out of its way to speak the same protocol.<br>

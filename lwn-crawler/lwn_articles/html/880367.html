<p>Linux supports processor architectures where CPUs in the same system
might have 
different processing capacities; for example, the Arm <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE">big.LITTLE</a>
systems combine fast, power-hungry CPUs with slower, more efficient
ones. Linux has also run for years on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading">simultaneous
multithreading</a> (SMT) architectures, where one CPU executes multiple
independent execution threads and is seen as if it were multiple cores.
There are architectures that mix both approaches. A recent discussion
on a <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210911011819.12184-1-ricardo.neri-calderon@linux.intel.com/">patch
set</a> submitted by Ricardo Neri shows that, on these systems, the
scheduler might distribute tasks in an inefficient way.

<h4>Simultaneous multithreading</h4>

<p>SMT functionality has been present in architectures like PowerPC
and x86 for years. On an SMT system, a CPU can run instructions from two (or
more) separate execution contexts. Each logical thread is visible 
as a separate CPU, so one physical CPU running two threads
will be seen in Linux as two CPUs. SMT processors using the
same hardware in this way are often called "siblings".
Operating systems have little control over an SMT processor's decisions
on how to divide its resources between execution contexts.
<p>
SMT allows better use of a processor's
resources because, when one execution path is stalled (waiting
for memory, for example), the physical CPU can execute instructions
from other threads. However, doubling the number of threads in a processor
does not normally double its processing capacity.  Both
threads are sharing the same resources, and the SMT mode is most
efficient when the system is under low load. Two SMT threads thus have
a lower
capacity than two physical CPU cores.
<p>
This reduced capacity needs to be
reflected in the scheduler, but the exact value of the reduction
depends on the load, so the kernel needs to use a heuristic. Linux
models this by reducing the CPU priority (which regulates how likely the
CPU is to be chosen to run a given task) for the second (and following)
CPU threads running on the same hardware.</p>

<p>Users can view sibling CPUs in the topology information available
on their systems
in <tt>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<i>X</i>/topology/core_cpus_list</tt>
(where <tt><i>X</i></tt> is the number of a CPU on the system). For
example, in a 12-core system with SMT:

<p>
<pre>
    $cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/core_cpus_list
    0,6
</pre>
</p>

<p>The result means that user-visible cores 0 and 6 are SMT siblings,
so they are using the same hardware core.

<h4><tt>ASYM_PACKING</tt></h4>

<p>Asymmetric packing (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.11/source/include/linux/sched/sd_flags.h#L140"><tt>SD_ASYM_PACKING</tt></a>
in the scheduler) is a feature <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.15-rc4&id=532cb4c401e225b084c14d6bd6a2f8ee561de2f1">originally
added</a> for the PowerPC architecture in 2010. It handles a case when
the scheduler can obtain better processor performance by moving tasks
to certain CPUs and leaving others idle. The busy CPUs can then move to a
lower SMT mode (running fewer threads) and obtain higher overall system
performance. <a
href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=linuxonibm/performance/tuneforsybase/smtsettings.htm">The
SMT modes documentation</a> for PowerPC includes some examples.</p>

<p>The <tt>ASYM_PACKING</tt> mode has witnessed a number of reworks and is
currently supported on x86 and PowerPC. The support for x86 includes a way
to support cores that might have a higher frequency than others, for
example using the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/702371/">Turbo
Boost Max Technology (ITMT) 3.0</a> feature. A short <a
href="https://blog.linuxplumbersconf.org/2016/ocw/system/presentations/3813/original/plumbers_fcore_v2.pdf">slide
set</a> from the 2016 Linux Plumbers Conference explains the work in
a little more detail.</p>

<h4>Mixing SMT and <tt>ASYM_PACKING</tt></h4>

<p>Neri observed some undesired scheduling behavior on a system
with three distinct CPU priorities. This system contains high-performance
cores (Intel Core) with their SMT siblings, along with lower-performance
cores (Intel Atom). The efficient scheduling approach in this case
(for some workloads at least)
is to use the high-performance cores first (but without their SMT
secondary threads), then the lower-performance cores, leaving the SMT
secondary cores for last. The scheduler was, instead, putting tasks on
the high-performance cores and their SMT siblings, leaving the other
cores idle.  As a result, tasks were contending for processor resources
while independent CPUs remained idle.</p>

<p>To understand this problem, consider the example from <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210911011819.12184-2-ricardo.neri-calderon@linux.intel.com/">one
of Neri's patches</a>. Imagine a system with two physical CPUs
with different priorities: 60 and 30 respectively. Both of them have
SMT siblings. The kernel assigns SMT priorities using an <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.11/source/arch/x86/kernel/itmt.c#L201">equation</a>
in the x86-specific code:
<pre>
    smt_prio = prio * smp_num_siblings / i;
</pre>
<p>where <tt>smt_prio</tt> is the effective priority, <tt>prio</tt> is
the original priority of the CPU, <tt>smp_num_siblings</tt> is
the number of siblings for each CPU (the value is two in Neri's
case), and <tt>i</tt> is the sibling number assigned to the given
physical CPU, starting from one. According to the
formula, the
resulting priorities are 120 for the main thread of the first CPU and 60
for its SMT sibling. For the second CPU, the main thread gets a
priority of 60, and the sibling a priority of 30. In this case, the SMT
sibling and the lower-performance main thread will have the same
priorities.</p>

<p>Neri wanted to change the scheduler to assign tasks to the
main thread of the second (physical) CPU before using the SMT sibling CPUs.
To that end, he proposed a modification to the
formula so that it would divide by <i>the square</i> of the sibling number:
<p>
<pre>
    smt_prio = prio * smp_num_siblings / (i*i);
</pre>
<p>
In this case, the priorities will be 120 and 30 for the
threads of the first CPU; then 60 and 15 for the threads of the second
CPU. Tasks will thus be scheduled first on both main threads.</p>

<p>
Neri's patch set makes another change when it comes to the scheduler's
load-balancing decisions, and specifically when the scheduler decides to
move a task from one CPU to another to even out the load on the system.
When considering whether to move a task from a source CPU to a new target
CPU, the scheduler considers whether the target has SMT siblings; if not,
it can receive tasks from an SMT source CPU that has at least two busy
threads.  If only one sibling in the source CPU is busy, tasks will be
moved only if the target CPU has a higher priority than the source.

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Scheduling performance improves by a few percent in some cases,
according to the benchmark results presented in the cover
letter, though it is smaller in most cases. Benchmarks also show also some
cases with performance degradation, but Neri gave no explanation for this
result.</p>

<p>The change has been merged for the 5.16 kernel, so owners of such
systems should see a change in scheduling and, hopefully, better performance.
This fix covers one scheduling corner case; there is no
reason to think it was the only one. We should expect to see more
adjustments in scheduling on asymmetric CPUs in the future.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think that&#x27;s already dealt with on ARM; there&#x27;s mixed 32/64-bit core CPUs that definitely can&#x27;t be called SMP by any stretch of the imagination. But in the brave new Intel world the hardware/firmware is *supposed to* lock out big core instructions before the OS starts (so less-capable OSes that only run on x86 don&#x27;t throw a fit).<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s Intel firmware though, so of course they screwed that up and some mainboards don&#x27;t do it correctly. Programs running on those without OS workarounds will get a SIGILL, and it&#x27;s not really worth trying to support such a setup when the manufacturer is actively trying to remove it.<br>

One thing that&#x27;s possible to do is to catch a SIGILL and use it to relocate the process to a core that supports the instruction (or, if you have no idea, a random one and hope that, eventually, it stops faulting). In the case of Intel, it looks like they disable the fancy instructions on the multi-arch chips, at least, so everyone has the least common denominator ISA. That, IMHO, is unfortunate, but necessary if you want to run an OS that doesn&#x27;t know how to deal with almost-SMP.<br>

which really would not be so different than how linux handles floatingpoint on all tasks already. The first FP-instruction does trap, so have AVX code trap and then set the CPU-mask would be very in character for linux.<br>
But in general there are many issues to solve with the growing asymmetry of cores. In all variants I have seen, Linux does not treat applications on big.LITTLE systems &quot;fair&quot; in a classical sense.  <br>

Wouldn&#x27;t the optimal behaviour depend on optimization goals? Low energy use would have a different optimal solution than highest performance.<br>
<p>
Potentially different tasks on the system might even have different goals here, some background task might not care so much about the time it takes to finish but would like to perform with minimal battery drain while foreground tasks the user waits for might want to prioritize not making the user wait for them.<br>

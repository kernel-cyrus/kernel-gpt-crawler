           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 28, 2019</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers are used to having to defend their work when posting it
to the mailing lists, so when a longtime kernel developer describes their
own work as 
"<q>expensive and nasty</q>", one tends to wonder what 
is going on.  The patch set in question is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190218165620.383905466@infradead.org/">core
scheduling</a> from Peter Zijlstra.  It is intended to make simultaneous
multithreading (SMT) usable on systems where cache-based side channels are
a concern, but even its author is far from convinced that it should
actually become part of the kernel.
<p>
SMT increases performance by turning one physical CPU into two virtual CPUs
that share the hardware; while one is waiting for data from memory, the
other can be executing.  Sharing a processor this closely has led to
security issues and concerns for years, and many security-conscious users
disable SMT entirely.  The disclosure of the <a href="/Articles/762570/">L1
terminal fault</a> vulnerability in 2018 did not improve the situation; for
many, SMT simply isn't worth the risks it brings with it.
<p>
But performance matters too, so there is interest in finding ways to make
SMT safe (or safer, at least) to use in environments with users who do not
trust each other.  The <a href="/Articles/764482/">coscheduling patch
set</a> posted last September was one attempt to solve this problem, but it
did not get far and has not been reposted.  One obstacle to this patch set
was almost certainly its complexity; it operated at every level of the
scheduling domain hierarchy, and thus addressed more than just the SMT
problem.
<p>
Zijlstra's patch set is focused on scheduling at the core level only,
meaning that it is intended to address SMT concerns but not to control
higher-level groups
of physical processors as a unit.  Conceptually, it is simple enough.  On
kernels where core scheduling is enabled, a <tt>core_cookie</tt> field is
added to the task structure; it is an <tt>unsigned long</tt> value.  These
cookies are used to define the trust boundaries; two processes with the
same cookie value trust each other and can be allowed to run simultaneously
on the same core.
<p>
By default, all processes have a cookie value of zero, placing them all in
the same trust group.  Control groups are used to manage cookie values via
a new <tt>tag</tt> field added to the CPU controller.  By placing a group
of processes into their own group and setting <tt>tag</tt> appropriately,
the system administrator can ensure that this group will not share a core
with any processes outside of the group.
<p>
Underneath, of course, there is some complexity involved in making all of
this work.  In current kernels, each CPU in an SMT core schedules
independently of the others, but that cannot happen when core scheduling is
enabled; scheduling decisions must now take into account what is happening
elsewhere in the core.  So when one CPU in a core calls into the scheduler,
it must 
evaluate the situation for all CPUs in that core.  The highest-priority
process eligible to run on any CPU in that core is chosen; if it has a
cookie value 
that excludes processes currently running in other CPUs, those processes
must be kicked out to ensure that no unwanted sharing takes place.  Other,
lower-priority processes might replace these outcasts, but only if they
have the right cookie value.
<p>
The CPU scheduler works hard to avoid moving processes between distant CPUs in
an attempt to maximize cache effectiveness.  Load balancing kicks in
occasionally to even out the load on the system as a whole.  The
calculation changes a bit, though, when core scheduling is in use; moving a
process is more likely to make sense if that process can run on a CPU that
would otherwise sit idle, even if the moved process leaves a hot cache
behind.  Thus, if an SMT CPU is forced idle due to cookie 
exclusion, a new load balancing algorithm will look across other cores for
a process with a matching cookie to move onto the idle CPU.
<p>
The patch set has seen a fair amount of discussion.  Greg Kerr,
representing Chrome&nbsp;OS, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAJGSLMt_X97Ux=1YiZcXWXvBy4n=ExO=2yAJhfbvxDh+wnWPvQ@mail.gmail.com/">questioned</a>
the control-group interface.  Making changes to control groups is a
privileged operation, but he would like for unprivileged processes to be
able to set their own cookies.  To that end, he proposed an API based on
<tt><strike>ptrace()</strike> prctl()</tt> calls.  Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190220094255.GE32494@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">replied</a>
that the interface issues can be worked out later; first it's necessary to
get everything working as desired.
<p>
Whether that can be done remains to be seen.  As Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wh32Zgp+bN7G1KH7SuCiY1YSJ41Y-_eWpfWubGjqq2_dw@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a>, performance is the key consideration here.  Core scheduling only
makes sense if it provides better throughput than simply running with SMT
disabled, so the decision on whether to merge it depends heavily on
benchmark results.  There is not a lot of data available yet; it seems that
perhaps it works better on certain types of virtualized loads (those that
only rarely exit back to the hypervisor) and worse on others.  Subhra
Mazumdar also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/e73e1b19-5418-32c8-584c-823618de67ce@oracle.com/">reported</a>
a performance regression on database loads.
<p>
Thus, even if core scheduling is eventually accepted, it seems unlikely to
be something that everybody turns on.  But it may yet be a tool that proves
useful for some environments where there is a need to get the most out of
the hardware, but where strong isolation between users is also needed.  The
process of finishing this work and figuring out if it justifies the costs
seems likely to take a while in any case; this sort of major surgery to the
CPU scheduler is not done lightly, even when its developer doesn't claim to
"<q>hate it with a passion</q>".  So security-conscious users seem
likely to be without an alternative to disabling SMT for some time yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

(Note: Greg Kerr suggested an API based on prctl, not ptrace.)<br>
<p>
Rather than using cgroups for this, what about making the default "processes that can ptrace each other can share a core"? (To a first approximation, that's "processes running as the same user and group".) Inventing a new mechanism that allows finer-grained usage of cookies seems like a waste; we already have mechanisms for processes to isolate themselves from each other, and we just need those mechanisms to help with side-channel attacks.<br>

"Processes that can ptrace each other" is likely to be an empty set with Yama set to restricted ptrace (i.e a process can only ptrace its children). I'd rather suggest that when you want to isolate processes you run them in different PID namespaces, so if I were to chose an already existing value to discriminate "processes that can run on the same core" I'd take "processes that are in the same PID namespaces"<br>

But in the case of ptrace there is a clear direction, as you say it should only be able to do side channel attacks on its children, but this kind of attack also allows to do it in the other direction, thus you can't prevent a child from doing side channel attack on its parent. Moreover it is quite long to check if two process are parents rather than compare two values like the suggested tag or a pid namespace identifier.<br>

Checking the user+group (which one? neither effective nor real UID+GID is sufficient when you have a setuid process you want to protect) is significantly more expensive than checking a single cookie for equality. In the scheduler, that matters.<br>

It might be possible to automatically create and set cookies based on things like UID + GID, in the same way that CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP automatically creates cgroups based on UID. That way the enforcement code only ever checks the single cookie.<br>

At this stage, it is hard to say exactly what the policy should look like.<br>

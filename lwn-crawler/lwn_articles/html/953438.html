</div>
The kernel's <a href="/Articles/743740/">deadline scheduling class</a>
offers a solution to a number of realtime (or generally latency-sensitive)
problems, but it is also resistant to the usual solutions for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion">priority-inversion</a>
problem.  The development community has been pursuing proxy execution as a
solution to a few scheduling challenges, including this one; the problem is
difficult and progress has been slow.  LWN last <a
href="/Articles/934114/">looked at proxy execution</a> in June; at the <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/17/page/198-lpc-2023-overview">2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>, John Stultz gave an overview of proxy execution,
the current status of the work, and the remaining problems to solve.
<p>
The current work is (at least partially) driven by the needs of the Android
system, where it would be useful to run some tasks with realtime
priorities.  Android has run into a lot of priority-inversion problems
while trying, though, and the classic solution for such problems (priority
inheritance) doesn't work for deadline or non-realtime tasks in Linux.  As
a result, Android systems cannot throttle background task activity in any
useful way without creating inconsistent behavior for the foreground tasks
that the user actually cares about at the moment.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/953445/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/JohnStultz-sm.png" alt="[John Stultz]"
title="John Stultz" class="rthumb"></a>

Priority inversion comes about when a lower-priority task holds a resource
that is needed by a higher-priority task; if the lower-priority task is
unable to obtain CPU time to run, it may hold that resource for a long
time, preventing the high-priority task from running.  Solutions usually
involve having the waiting task lend its priority to the task holding the
resource it needs, so that the holding task can run and release the
resource.  Deadline tasks in Linux, though, have no priority, so a
different approach is needed.
<p>
The core idea behind proxy execution is to track the "blocked-on"
relationship between tasks waiting for a resource and the task owning that
resource.  In current kernels, a task that is waiting for a resource will
be removed from the run queue; with proxy execution, instead, it would be
left on the queue as if it were still runnable.  Should the scheduler
actually select the blocked task to run, it will follow the blocked-on link
to run the holder of the resource instead.  The wait task, in effect,
donates some of the run time it would have been given toward the goal of
freeing the resource it needs.
<p>
That idea is simple, but the implementation turns out to be complex.  The
task holding a resource may, in turn, be blocked on a second resource, so
the scheduler may have to follow a chain of blocked-on links, of arbitrary
length, to get to a task that can actually be run.  The blocked-on links
can cross CPUs; before the scheduler can run the task pointed to by such a
link, it will need to migrate the blocked task to the CPU where the holder
is actually running.  It might be that the resource holder at the end of a
blocked-on chain is currently sleeping (unable to run) for some other
reason, meaning no progress can be made until that task can run again.  In
this case, the originally blocked task is enqueued onto the sleeping task
that holds the resource, so that both can be awakened together.  There are
other challenges as well.
<p>
Even so, proxy execution shows some real promise.  Stultz showed results
from workloads that, on current kernels, experienced occasional large
latencies as the result of priority inversion.  The addition of proxy
execution made those latencies go away.  So proxy execution is "very
attractive" for the Android use case, he said.
<p>
There have been three versions of this work posted since it was <a
href="/Articles/935180/">presented at the OSPM conference</a> in April.  He
has been reworking the patch series to make it bisectable; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20231106193524.866104-1-jstultz@google.com/">version&nbsp;6</a>
of the patch set was posted in early November.  Among other things, that
version has partially fixed a performance regression that was introduced in
the previous round.
<p>
There are a few outstanding problems, he said, as he approached the end of
his prepared talk.  The handling of the sleeping-owner problem described
above is hard to get right; the intent is to enqueue the waiting
(higher-priority) task onto the owning task, so that they can wake
together, but that is complex.  Stultz worried that implementing that
solution could involve reinventing the kernel's run queues.  If a task has
been migrated to lend its execution time to a resource holder, it should be
migrated back once the blockage has been resolved, but that is slow and
involves locking challenges.  The performance regression introduced in
version&nbsp;5 still has not been fully resolved.  There is also the little
problem of adding some significant complexity to the scheduler, which is
already a "terribly subtle" and difficult kernel subsystem.
<p>
Stultz concluded by saying that he is still working to find the best way to
break up the patch series.  He wondered whether Android needed to ship a
kernel with proxy execution before it would be seriously considered for the
mainline.  That would show the value of the work, but it would also
increase the divergence between the Android and mainline kernels, which is
something that the Android project would like to avoid.  Once a feature has
been added to Android, he said, it can be quite difficult to remove, since
vendors quickly come to depend on it.  He closed with a request for more
reviews of the design and correctness of the proxy-execution patches.
<p>
The ensuing discussion was mostly focused on reader/writer locks (rwlocks),
which are not currently handled by the proxy-execution patches.  Thomas
Gleixner said that priority inheritance has, in the past, proved to not be
an option for rwlocks; it ends up being far too complex.  Boosting the
holder of a write lock (in response to a higher-priority reader needing the
lock) is easy, since there can only be one writer, but there can be
multiple readers, complicating the picture.  Having one blocked writer
trying to boost a whole set of readers doesn't scale, he said, and "gets
messy".
<p>
Gleixner said that, in the realtime tree, they gave up and settled for just
boosting writers; that improves the situation, but leaving readers
unboosted can lead to writer starvation.  That said, perhaps the problem is
not as big of a concern now.  Fifteen years ago, there were a lot of highly
contended rwlocks in the kernel, but many of the users of rwlocks,
especially in the networking subsystem, have switched to using
read-copy-update instead.  The one big holdout is the <a
href="/Articles/893906/"><tt>mmap_lock</tt></a>, but code needing that lock
is already running in a slow path and can afford to wait a bit.  He has not
seen any problems with writer starvation recently.  So the real solution
for rwlocks, he concluded, is to simply stop using them.
<p>
At that point, the session ran out of time.  For the curious, the <a

This rather reinforces the point that most highly contended rwsem users have migrated to RCU (and it's got better since May).<br>
<p>
v6.4 has support for RCU page faults on normal anon memory. v6.6 adds support for swap cache, uffd, DAX and page cache. v6.7 adds support for file-backed faults that are not present in the page cache and support for COW faults of file-backed memory.<br>
<p>
With v6.7 only device driver faults and hugetlb faults are not handled under RCU. The latter is in progress and the former is up to device driver writers.<br>

Of course you can, which makes the whole thing even more interesting.<br>

There's also the fun possibility that the deadlock isn't *actually* dead: the code could have allocated a resource, then delegated the actual work-and-release part to a different thread.<br>

Then you've already hit a deadlock. This work will have no effect on that. Fortunately, this is the kind of deadlock that lockdep can already detect, long before it happens. So I wouldn't claim that Linux is guaranteed 100% free of this kind of deadlock, but the tools notify developers long before customers hit them.<br>

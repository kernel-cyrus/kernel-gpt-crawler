Bernd Schubert led a session at the <a
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> on the <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/7038cabf-e9bb-394a-e084-11bc23813fc7@ddn.com/">intersection</a>
of <a 
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html">FUSE</a>
and <a href="/Kernel/Index/#io_uring">io_uring</a>.  He
works for DDN Storage, which is using FUSE for two network-storage
products; he has found FUSE to be a bottleneck for those filesystems.  That
could perhaps be 
improved by using io_uring, which is something he has been working on and
wanted to discuss. 
</p>

</a>

<p>
He noted that Boaz Harrosh had <a href="/Articles/756625/">developed the
zero-copy user-mode filesystem</a> (ZUFS) in 2018, but it did not go
upstream in part due to <a href="/Articles/787630/">concerns about its
overlap with FUSE</a>.  Meanwhile, Miklos Szeredi started working on FUSE2,
but that has languished as well.  Schubert briefly looked at both, but the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mszeredi/fuse.git/log/?h=fuse2">FUSE2
Git tree</a> was hard to review since it is a single big patch rather than
being broken into reviewable pieces.
</p>

<p>
Last year, he was working on atomic open operations and noticed
some problems; Szeredi asked for some benchmarks, which <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20220322121212.5087-1-dharamhans87@gmail.com/">turned
out to be confusing</a>. 
Multiple threads were reading from
<tt>/dev/fuse</tt>, which caused the confusing results; switching to a
single thread made the results consistent.  He also realized that
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/6ba14287-336d-cdcd-0d39-680f288ca776@ddn.com/">performing
a polling loop</a> before adding an operation to the wait queue greatly
improved the filesystem performance.

<p>
He was also looking at an NVMe driver that his company uses, wondering why
it was able to avoid the bottlenecks that he was seeing; it used io_uring,
but in the "wrong" direction, from user space to the kernel, while FUSE
needed to go the other way.  Around that time, the <a
href="/Articles/844875/"><tt>IORING_OP_URING_CMD</tt> support for
io_uring</a> was added, which is being used in the <a
href="/Articles/903855/">ublk user-space block driver</a> in the right
direction, from the kernel to user space.  That provides a model for doing
something similar in FUSE, which is what Schubert has been working on.
</p>

<p>
He explained the inner workings of the work he has done to make FUSE use
io_uring.  There is one thread per core, each with its own ring buffer;
there is a shared memory buffer with the FUSE queue ID used as the offset
for user space to <tt>mmap()</tt> its region.  Libfuse initiates operations
with an <tt>IORING_OP_URING_CMD</tt>, which is the core idea taken from
ublk.  For debugging purposes, there is a mode with a single thread and
ring buffer. 
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein asked whether user space really needed to be aware of the
underlying implementation.  Schubert replied that his goal was to make it
transparent, so that existing filesystem implementations could gain the
performance benefits 
without having to change their code.
</p>

<p>
He is unhappy with using the queue ID to identify the user-space buffer
(via the <tt>mmap()</tt> offset),
but was unable to find the corresponding buffer in the kernel without it.
There was some discussion of ways to get the kernel and user-space in sync
on the buffer location directly.  Jan Kara suggested looking in the VMA
associated with the user-space virtual address to find where in kernel
memory the buffer was located; he said that he could help Schubert find the
right calls to make for that.
</p>

<p>
Schubert showed some performance benchmarks, but noted that he needs to find a
way to keep the scheduler from migrating the application processes to other
CPUs. For example, direct I/O reads showed moderate improvements for
io_uring over regular FUSE, but much larger improvements when migration was
disabled.  Kara 
cautioned that CPU migration can be a problem at the start of a test like
this, but 
may not actually be problematic over the long term;  meanwhile, there are other
workloads that may benefit from the migration.  
</p>

<p>
But Schubert said that FUSE
is particularly affected by this because most of the I/O work is being
handed off to another process; once it completes, it is best if the
application process is still running on that same CPU.  Kara said that it
is not a simple problem and that the scheduler may lack the information it
needs to make the right decision.  The scheduler developers are aware that
there may be problems in scheduling for io_uring and are working on some
solutions; he 
recommended that Schubert work with those developers.

Not entirely exact :) The kernel address is mapped to userspace - we have the kernel address. And then vma-&gt;vm_start is the user address (in the new fuse_uring_mmap function - file_operations::mmap). Except that printk result differed from what I see in userspace - I had assumed the address is obfuscated before being send to userspace. After discussing with Jan and and looking at the the code together, it turned out that it is actually printk %p that obfuscates the printed result - problem solved - offset parameter to identify the queue ID can be avoided.<br>

I probably should have skipped that comment/background explanation.<br>
We are not using io_uring for our nvme driver, but our own driver implementation. Nvme rings in general made think about a ring solution for fuse. Next step was then to think about io_uring.<br>

As a simple end-user with little clue of what is going on, how far would these changes potentially position FUSE with respect to in-kernel FS drivers (assuming the user-space part of the FUSE driver is decently optimised)?<br>

The answer really depends a bit on what your fuse 'driver' (daemon) is doing. <br>
Outstanding is zero copy support, I will look into that once I'm through with the scheduler. Zero copy will help with overlay and anything you don't need to access the IO buffer yourself - ZC is worked on by the ublk developer is not handing out the application buffer to the daemon, but is splice like approach were the buffer stays in the kernel. So if need the buffer (as we do), you will need to pay the penalty of a memory copy - a bit latency and possibly limited by system memory bandwidth (quite high, though) - we run into it in HPC, desktop systems might not. If you don't need the buffer, ZC has the overhead of a message (CQE) from kernel to daemon and back (SQE) - IOPs are the limit.  And there it gets difficult to answer the question again for async (like buffered reads/writes). With the ring a single kernel/userspace submission can handle multiple requests - ring queue size and iosize from the mm system then matter.<br>
<p>
A bit easier to answer are synchronous meta data requests, take a single threaded application creating files, like bonnie++ with a zero file size, file creates/s increase from about 2000 - 2500 creates/s to about 9000 to 9500 creates/s, with an overlay to xfs. XFS native on my system is about 16000 to 21000 creates/s. Absolute numbers depend on run time (the longer the higher - due to cpu freq increase) and cpu frequency govenor (default is 'convervative' - plain fuse really has an issue with it, /dev/fuse numbers are better in 'performance' mode, but native xfs and fuse-uring do not show much of a difference).<br>

On its face, memory management would appear to be a straightforward task.
When memory gets tight, the VM code need only evict the pages which will be
unused for the longest time, making that memory available
for shorter-term use.  The hard part, of course, is identifying those
pages.  In the absence of perfect predictions of future memory use, the VM
subsystem must rely upon a set of heuristics to make a set of (hopefully)
reasonable choices.  The design of heuristics which can handle most
workloads is tricky, and even subtle code changes can lead to big changes
in system behavior.
<p>
Since the beginning of the 2.6.31 development cycle, some users have been
complaining about an increase in kernel memory allocation failures, leading
to log messages, failed applications, and the occasional unwelcome
appearance of the out-of-memory killer.  Various bugs have been filed (see
<a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14141">#14141</a> and
<a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14265">#14265</a>, for
example) and a fair amount of head-scratching has gone on.  But few
developers really know where to start when looking at this kind of problem,
and, of those who do, some have been content to write off the problem as
being caused by higher-order allocations.  So progress has been slow.
<p>
High-order (multi-page) allocations are a perennial problem on Linux
systems; as memory fragments, it gets increasingly hard to find groups of
physically-contiguous pages to satisfy higher-order allocation requests.
Whenever possible, kernel code is written to avoid high-order allocations,
but there are times when that is difficult.  Many of the recently-reported
problems seemingly have to do with certain not-top-of-the-line wireless
network adapters which require contiguous memory chunks to operate.  Fixing
the problem is important - users of cheap network interfaces want to run
Linux too - but there are also reports of single-page allocation failures.
<p>
Fortunately, Mel Gorman is not afraid to wander into that part of the
kernel; he has been putting some serious time into reproducing the problem
and trying to understand what has gone wrong since 2.6.30.  Mel has posted
<a href="/Articles/362184/">a five-part patch series</a> which tries to
make allocation failures less likely again.  Looking at what Mel has done
provides a good lesson on just how subtle this kind of programming can be.
<p>
When looking at this code, it's worth bearing in mind that the kernel has
two fundamental mechanisms for recovering memory when it is needed for new
allocations.  <b>Direct reclaim</b> is active memory cleaning done at
allocation time; when an allocation falls short, the process trying to
allocate the memory will go off and try to free some memory elsewhere in
the system.  Direct reclaim has the advantages of immediacy - reclaim work
happens right away when memory pressure hits - and of dumping the
work into processes which are allocating memory, but there are limits to
how long any one process can spend reclaiming memory without introducing
unacceptable latencies.  So more extensive cleaning is pushed off to the
<b>kswapd</b> kernel thread, which is dedicated to that task.
<p>
Current mainline kernels do not wake up kswapd from the direct reclaim code
if the direct reclaim operation fails to get the job done.  But if memory
is that tight, kswapd should be running, especially if high-order
allocations are needed.  So the first patch in Mel's series is a simple
one-liner which causes kswapd to be waked on direct allocation failure and,
perhaps, to work harder on recovering higher-order chunks as well.  That
change brings behavior back to something closer to what older kernels did.
<p>
Patch #2 is a simple tweak which keeps realtime interrupt handlers from
driving the memory allocation code too hard.  Again, this is a reversion to
behavior seen back in the 2.6.30 days.
<p>
The third patch is a bit more subtle.  Direct reclaim will, if it is
successful, result in the creation of I/O operations to write dirty pages
to their backing store.  There are limits to the number of block I/O
operations which can be outstanding, though; once that limit is hit the
underlying device is said to be "congested" and the task performing reclaim
is forced to wait until things clear out a bit.  This "congestion wait"
keeps the system from filling up with pending I/O operations and serves to
throttle processes performing memory allocations.
<p>
As it happens, there are actually two "wait for congestion" queues - one
each for synchronous and asynchronous requests.  "Synchronous" requests are
those for which a process is actively waiting - read requests, usually - 
while asynchronous requests are those which do not have active waiters.  In current
kernels, direct reclaim waits on the asynchronous queue, while older
kernels used the synchronous queue instead.  Moving back to the synchronous
queue makes a number of problems go away, but Mel sees that fix as being
workload-specific.  Instead, he has changed the direct reclaim code to make
it wait for congestion to clear on <i>both</i> queues.
<p>
Why does this help?  It seems to be a matter of letting kswapd get its job
done.  Kswapd, too, must wait when queues become congested; if direct
reclaimers are frequently filling the I/O queues, kswapd will stall more
often.  It turns out that better results are had if kswapd is allowed to
run for longer periods of time.  Making direct reclaimers wait until both
queues have cleared allows kswapd to get some real work done once it gets
going.  That is good for the creation of high-order chunks and the
performance of the system in general.
<p>
Patch #4 also relates to kswapd's duty cycle.  Kswapd will stop working and
go to sleep once it decides that it has done enough; one definition of
"enough" is when the amount of free memory reaches an upper watermark
value.  But if kswapd is running, chances are good that there is unmet
demand for memory in the system; in that situation, the amount of free
memory may not stay above the high watermark for very long.  Mel's patch
has kswapd start with a catnap rather than a real sleep; after
0.1&nbsp;sec., kswapd wakes back up and reassesses the situation.  If the
amount of free memory has fallen below the high watermark in that time,
kswapd goes back to work; otherwise it goes to sleep for real.  In this
way, kswapd will continue to work to free memory if the system is consuming
it quickly.
<p>
The final patch touches on another aspect of waiting for congestion.  When
block devices become congested, kswapd waits for things to clear.  But, Mel
notes, that may not be the right thing to do in all situations:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	However, on systems with large numbers of high-order atomics due to
	crappy network cards, it's important that kswapd keep working in
	parallel to save their sorry ass.
</div>
<p>
In the original version of the patch, kswapd would become increasingly
resistant to waiting for congestion as the situation got worse.  Motohiro
Kosaki <a href="/Articles/362218/">suggested an alternative approach</a>,
though, wherein kswapd simply refuses to wait as long as the high watermark
is not reached, and Mel adopted it.
<p>
Mel's patch posting includes a fair amount of information on how he has
tested it and what the results are.  With the patch set applied, allocation
failures are fewer, and system throughput improves as well.  The sad truth
about memory management patches, though, is that a change which improves
one workload may worsen another.  So these changes really need some
widespread testing, especially since there is some interest in getting them
into 2.6.32.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

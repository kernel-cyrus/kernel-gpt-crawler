<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 27, 2010</br>
           </div>
The removal of the big kernel lock (BKL) has been one of the
longest-running projects in kernel development history.  The BKL has been a
clear scalability and maintainability problem since its addition in the 1.3
development series; efforts to move away from it began in the 2.1 cycle.
But the upcoming 2.6.34 kernel will still feature a big kernel lock,
despite all the work that has been done to get rid of it.  The good news is
that 2.6.35 might just work without the BKL - at least, for a number of
configurations.
<p>
Over the years, use of the BKL has been pushed down into ever lower levels
of the kernel.  Once a <tt>lock_kernel()</tt> call has been pushed into an
individual device driver, for example, it is relatively easy to determine
whether it is really necessary and, eventually, get rid of it altogether.
There is, however, one significant BKL acquisition left in the core kernel:
the <tt>ioctl()</tt> implementation.  The kernel has supported a BKL-free
<tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> operation for years, but there are still many
drivers which depend on the older, BKL-protected version.
<p>
Clearly, fixing the <tt>ioctl()</tt> problem is a key part of the overall
BKL solution.  To that end, Frederic Weisbecker and Arnd Bergmann posted <a
href="/Articles/384858/">a patch</a> to prepare the ground for change.
This patch adds yet another <tt>ioctl()</tt> variant called
<tt>locked_ioctl()</tt> to the <tt>file_operations</tt> structure.  The
idea was to have both <tt>ioctl()</tt> and <tt>locked_ioctl()</tt> in place
for long enough to change all of the code which still requires the BKL,
after which <tt>ioctl()</tt> could be removed.
This new function was also made dependent on a new <tt>CONFIG_BKL</tt>
configuration option.
<p>
That patch did not get very far; Linus <a href="/Articles/384860/">strongly
disliked</a> both <tt>locked_ioctl()</tt> and <tt>CONFIG_BKL</tt>.  So the
search for alternatives began.  In the end, it looks like
<tt>locked_ioctl()</tt> may never happen, but the configuration option will
eventually exist.
<p>
Linus's suggestion was to not bother with <tt>locked_ioctl()</tt>.
Instead, every <tt>ioctl()</tt> operation should just be renamed to
<tt>bkl_ioctl()</tt> in one big patch.  That would allow code which depends
on the BKL to be easily located with <tt>grep</tt> without adding yet
another function to <tt>struct file_operations</tt> even temporarily.  <a
href="/Articles/384861/">A patch which does this renaming</a> has been
posted; this patch may well be merged for 2.6.35.
<p>
Or perhaps not.  Arnd has taken a more traditional approach with <a
href="/Articles/384862/">his patch</a> which simply pushes the BKL down
into every remaining <tt>ioctl()</tt> function which needs it.  Once a
specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> 
function handles BKL acquisition itself, it can be called from the core
kernel as an <tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> function instead.  When all such
functions have been converted, the locked version of <tt>ioctl()</tt> can
go away, and the BKL can be removed from that bit of core code.  The
pushdown is a bigger job than the renaming, but it accomplishes a couple of
important goals.
<p>
One of those goals is simply getting the BKL closer to the code which
depends on it, facilitating its eventual removal.  The other is to get that
much closer to a point where the BKL can simply be configured out of the
kernel altogether.  That is where the <tt>CONFIG_BKL</tt> option comes in.
Turning that option off will remove BKL support, causing any code which
depends on it to fail to compile.  That code can be annotated with its BKL
dependency, again making it easier to find and fix.
<p>
On the face of it, configuring out the BKL may not seem like a hugely
desirable thing to do; it takes little space, and the overhead seems small
if nobody is actually using it.  But there is small - but significant -
savings to be had: currently the scheduler must check, at every context
switch, whether the BKL must be released by the outgoing process and/or
reacquired by the incoming process.  Context switches happen often enough
that it's worth making them as fast as possible; eliminating the BKL
outright will make a small contribution toward that goal.
<p>
Making the BKL configurable will also be a motivating factor for anybody
who finds that their BKL-free kernel build is blocked by one crufty old
driver.  Most of the remaining BKL-dependent drivers are unloved and
unmaintained; many 
of them may be entirely unused.  Those which are still being used may well
be fixed once a suitably-skilled developer realizes that a small amount of
work will suffice to banish the BKL from a specific system forevermore.
<p>
In the end, 2.6.35 will not be, as a whole, a BKL-free kernel.  But, if
this work gets in, and if <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/381164/">some
other core patches</a> are accepted, it may just become possible to build a
number of configurations without the big kernel lock.  That, certainly, is
an achievement worth celebrating.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There is a wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/BigKernelLock">http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/BigKernelLock</a> describing the other things that still need to be fixed before we can build a kernel without the BKL. We have patches for all of them, but there are still complications in the block, tty and fs/locks areas.<br>
<p>
Note that the idea of the new -&gt;locked_ioctl() operations was to replace the existing -&gt;ioctl() one before 2.6.35-rc1, they were not meant to exist in parallel beyond that.<br>
<p>
Pushing the BKL down with the new patches achieves everything that this would have done, and more, so the extra work was well worth it.<br>

Is seems however there is some resistance to this on Linus' part:<br>

Or maybe Linus is only referring to 2.6.34 here, not entirely sure.<br>

Why keep something around that is not really wanted?  That only invites developers to periodically introduce new dependencies.  You will eliminate in one release only to have to put it back in later.<br>

  It might be desirable to have an init option to enable or disable the BKL.  It could make testing easier and faster.<br>

Because it might protect datas from concurrent accesses.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;&gt; That only invites developers to periodically introduce new dependencies. &gt;&gt; You will eliminate in one release only to have to put it back in later</font><br>
<p>
Not really. Most of the time, a new driver that uses the bkl will be spotted<br>
and won't be merged, except may be for the llseek case, which is a bit particular.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;&gt; It might be desirable to have an init option to enable or disable the BKL. It could make testing easier and faster.</font><br>
<p>
The problem is not here. You don't catch every possible races by just testing without the bkl. When you kill the bkl at some places, you need to prove that what you are doing is safe, by explaining the locking involved and so. Testing is not sufficient.<br>

To a great extent, memory management is based on making predictions: which
pages of memory will a given process need in the near future?
Unfortunately, it turns out that predictions are hard, especially when they
are about future events.  In the absence of useful information sent back from
the future, memory-management subsystems are forced to rely on observations
of recent behavior and an assumption that said behavior is likely
to continue.  The kernel's memory-management decisions are
opaque to user space, though, and often result in less-than-optimal
performance.  A pair of patch sets from SeongJae 
Park tries to make memory-usage patterns visible to user space, and to let
user space change memory-management decisions in response.
<p>
At the core of this new mechanism is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200217102544.29012-1-sjpark@amazon.com/">the data
access monitor</a> or DAMON, which is intended to provide information on
memory-access patterns to user space.  Conceptually, its operation is
simple; DAMON starts by dividing a process's address space into a number of
equally sized regions.  It then monitors accesses to each region, providing
as its output a histogram of the number of accesses to each region.  From
that, the consumer of this information (in either user space or the kernel)
can request changes to optimize the process's use of memory.
<p>
Reality is a bit more complex than that, of course.  Current hardware
allows for a huge address space, most of which is unused; dividing that
space into (for example) 1000 regions could easily result in all of the
used address space being pushed into just a couple of regions.  So DAMON
starts by splitting the address space into three large chunks which are, to
a first approximation, the text, heap, and stack areas.  Only those areas
are monitored for access patterns.
<p>
For each region, DAMON tries to track the number of accesses.  Watching
every page in a region would be expensive, though, and one of the design
goals of DAMON is to be efficient enough to run on production workloads.
These objectives are reconciled by assuming that all pages in a given region
have approximately equal access patterns, so there is no need to watch more
than one of them.  Thus, within each region, the "accessed" bit on a
randomly selected page is cleared, then occasionally checked.  If that page
has been accessed, then the region is deemed to have been accessed.
<p>
It would be nice if a process being monitored would helpfully line up its
memory-access patterns to match the regions chosen by DAMON, but such
cooperation is rare in real-world systems.  So the layout of those equally
sized regions is unlikely to correspond well with how memory is actually being
used.  DAMON attempts to compensate for this by adjusting the regions on
the fly as the process executes.  Regions showing heavy access patterns are
divided into smaller areas, while those seeing little use are coalesced
into larger blocks.  If all this works well, the result over time should be a
zeroing-in on the truly hot areas of the target process's address space.
<p>
To control all of this, DAMON creates a set of virtual files in the debugfs
filesystem.  There is no access control implemented within DAMON itself,
but those files are set up for root access only by default.  All of the
relevant parameters — target process, number of regions, and sampling and
aggregation periods — can be configured by writing to those files.  The
resulting data can be read from debugfs; it is also possible to have the
kernel write sampling data directly to a file, from which it can be
processed at leisure.  As an alternative, users can attach to a tracepoint
to receive the data as it is generated; this makes it readily available to
the <tt>perf</tt> tool, among other things.
<p>
That data, however it is obtained, is essentially a histogram; each memory
region is a bin and the number of hits in that bin is recorded.  That data
can be analyzed by hand, of course; there is also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200217102854.30005-1-sjpark@amazon.com/">a sample
script</a> that can feed it to <a
href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> to present the information in a
more graphic form.  This information, Park says, can be highly useful:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	To see the usefulness of the monitoring, we optimized 9 memory
	intensive workloads among them for memory pressure situations using
	the DAMON outputs.  In detail, we identified frequently accessed
	memory regions in each workload based on the DAMON results and
	protected them with mlock() system calls.  The optimized
	versions consistently show speedup (2.55x in best case, 1.65x in
	average) under memory pressure.
</div>
<p>
That kind of speedup certainly justifies spending some time looking at a
process's memory patterns.  It would be even nicer, though, if the kernel
could do that work itself — that is what a memory-management subsystem is
supposed to be for, after all.  As a step in that direction, Park has
posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200218085309.18346-1-sjpark@amazon.com/">a
separate patch set</a> implementing the "data access monitoring-based
memory operation schemes".  This mechanism allows users to tell DAMON how
to respond to specific sorts of access patterns.  This is done through a
new debugfs file ("<tt>schemes</tt>") that accepts lines like:
<p>
<pre>
    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
</pre>
<p>
Each rule will apply to regions between <tt>min-size</tt> and
<tt>max-size</tt> in length with access counts between
<tt>min-acc</tt> and <tt>max-acc</tt>.  These counts must have been
accumulated in a region with an age between <tt>min-age</tt> and
<tt>max-age</tt>.  The "age" of a region is reset whenever a significant
change happens; this can include the application of an action or a resizing
of the region itself.
<p>
The <tt>action</tt> is, at this point, a command to be passed to an <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
call on the region; supported values are
<tt>MADV_WILLNEED</tt>,
<tt>MADV_COLD</tt>,
<tt>MADV_PAGEOUT</tt>,
<tt>MADV_HUGEPAGE</tt>, and
<tt>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</tt>.  Actions of this type could be used to, for example,
explicitly force out a region that sees little use or to request that huge
pages be used for hot regions.  Comments within the patch set suggest that
<tt>mlock</tt> is also envisioned as an action, but that is not currently
implemented.
<p>
A mechanism like this has clear value when it comes to helping developers tune
the memory-management subsystem for their workloads.  It raises an interesting
question, though: given that the kernel can be made to tune itself for
better memory-management results, why isn't this capability a part of the
memory-management subsystem itself?  Bolting it on as a separate module
might be useful for memory-management developers, who are likely interested
in trying out various ideas.  But one might well argue that production
systems should Just Work without the need for this sort of manual tweaking,
even if the tweaking is supported by a capable monitoring system.  While
DAMON looks like a useful tool now, users may be forgiven for hoping that
it makes itself obsolete over time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Appreciate this great introduction of my patchsets, Jon!<br>
<p>
I also made several web pages showing DAMON outputs in more intuitive (visualized) way: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200220081710.15211-1-sjpark@amazon.com/T/#me3e5f5e563ab5ea95952506e5f08ece59c8d3bd6">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200220081710.15211-1-s...</a><br>
You can show how the data access pattern monitored by DAMON seems like there.  Nonetheless, the pages are showing only visualized data access patterns and related analysis results.  More reports including performance test results will be also available soon at <a href="https://damonitor.github.io/reports/latest/">https://damonitor.github.io/reports/latest/</a>.  Stay tuned!<br>
<p>
Also, I would like to give my answer to the last question: "given that the kernel can be made to tune itself for better memory-management results, why isn't this capability a part of the memory-management subsystem itself?"<br>
<p>
Actually, DAMON provides two interfaces.  The interfaces using debugfs and the tracepoints are for privileged userspace programs, profilers, and people.  Beside of the interface, DAMON also provides a programmable interface for kernel code.  Using this programmable interface, the memory-management subsystem can use DAMON.  Indeed, making the system 'Just Work' in optimal way using DAMON is the ultimate goal of this project.<br>
<p>
That said, I believe the debugfs interfaces could still be an useful and easy-to-control knob for environments having unique characteristics.  Of course, third party kernel modules using the programmable interface for complex schemes which cannot described with the simple format ('min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action') for specific environments are also imaginable.<br>

But also, when testing scientific hypotheses it's common to make predictions about current or past events in order to determine the accuracy of the predictions.  This is how models are created.<br>

For the test, I ran the application in a seperated cgroup.  Thus, the speedup was not came from such sacrifices of other processes.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; To a great extent, memory management is based on making predictions: which pages of memory will a given process need in the near future? </font><br>
<p>
That is what *caching* is about. We have random access memory for a reason, and even a MMU and the overhead it brings (easily turning a single access into 5 accesses) is unnecessary (and does not mean insecurity, although that is the general assumption). You&#x27;ve locked yourself into an overcommit world, and then are trying to remove all the dung that comes with it, but I really think that is the wrong approach.<br>
<p>
MMUs were designed the way they are because it was a virtual machine approach to DOS (and then history repeats itsself with what we now call virtual machines), but it isn&#x27;t the most efficient method of adding multi-process memory access security to RAM, with the power-hungry TLBs.<br>

Do you have some pointers to an alternative?<br>

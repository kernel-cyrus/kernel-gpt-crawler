<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 27, 2022</br>
           </div>
The practice of requiring copyright assignments for contributions to
free-software projects has been in decline for years; the GNU Binutils
project may be <a
href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2022-October/123680.html">the
latest domino to fall</a> in that regard.  The Linux kernel project,
unlike some others, has always allowed contributors to retain their copyrights,
resulting in a code base that has widely distributed ownership.  In such a
project, who owns the copyright to a given piece of code is not always
obvious. Some
developers (or their employers) are insistent about the placement of
copyright notices in the code to document their ownership of parts of the
kernel.  A series of recent discussions within the Btrfs subsystem, though,
has made it clear that there is no project-wide policy on when these
notices are warranted — or even acceptable.

<p>
In early September, a <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/cover.1662420176.git.sweettea-kernel@dorminy.me/">patch
series</a> implementing fscrypt integration for the Btrfs filesystem
included <a 
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/685c8abce7bdb110bc306752314b4fb0e7867290.1662420176.git.sweettea-kernel@dorminy.me/">this
patch</a> adding, among other things, a one-line Facebook copyright notice.
Btrfs maintainer David Sterba <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/20220909101521.GS32411@twin.jikos.cz/">replied</a>
with a request to limit copyright information to SPDX tags; he cited <a
href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Developer%27s_FAQ#Copyright_notices_in_files.2C_SPDX">a
page in the Btrfs wiki</a>, asserting that these tags are a complete
replacement for copyright notices.  Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/Yxs43SlMqqJ4Fa2h@infradead.org/">disagreed</a>,
pointing out that SPDX describes licensing but not ownership:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 It is not a replacement for the copyright notice in any way, and
	 having been involved with Copyright enforcement I can tell you
	 that at least in some jurisdictions Copyright notices absolutely
	 do matter.
</blockquote>
<p>
Hellwig, of course, was the initiator of a GPL-infringement lawsuit against
VMware that was <a href="/Articles/696764/">dismissed</a> due to an
inability to prove ownership of the code in question.  It is thus
unsurprising that he is sensitive to the placement of copyright notices in
the code itself.  When Hellwig submitted <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/20220912141121.3744931-2-hch@lst.de/">a patch of his
own</a>, also in September, that added a copyright notice to a 
newly created file, Sterba <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/20220921094014.GB32411@twin.jikos.cz/">let it be
known</a> that he would refuse that change as well.  Toward the end of
October, in the discussion of <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20220901074216.1849941-1-hch@lst.de/">yet another
patch set</a>, Hellwig eventually <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20221024144411.GA25172@lst.de/">withdrew the
work</a>, saying:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	FYI, I object to merging any of my code into btrfs without a proper
	copyright notice, and I also need to find some time to remove my
	previous significant changes given that the btrfs maintainer
	refuses to take the proper and legally required copyright notice.
</blockquote>
<p>
Given that the kernel code has no shortage of copyright notices (nearly
79,000 lines contain the word "copyright"), it is natural to wonder why
this policy is being applied in the Btrfs subsystem.  The Btrfs wiki page
describes the reasoning:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The copyright notices are not required and are discouraged for
	reasons that are practical rather than legal. The files do not
	track all individual contributors nor companies (this can be found
	in git), so the inaccurate and incomplete information gives a very
	skewed if not completely wrong idea about the copyright holders of
	changes in a given file. The code is usually heavily changed over
	time in smaller portions, slowly morphing into something that does
	not resemble the original code anymore though it shares a lot of
	the core ideas and implemented logic. A copyright notice by a
	company that does not exist anymore from 10 years ago is a clear
	example of uselessness for the developers.
</blockquote>
<p>
The page also states that the Signed-off-by tags found in the kernel's Git
history are sufficient to document the copyright status of the code.  There
are a few difficulties with this position, including the fact that those
tags indicate that the submitter has the right to contribute the code to
the kernel, but do not necessarily show who the copyright owner is.
Another problem was <a
href="/ml/linux-btrfs/YyfNMcUM+OHn5qi8@ebb.org/">pointed out</a> by Bradley
Kuhn: if the Git history serves as the copyright notices for the code, then
it will be necessary to ship the entire Git repository to be in compliance
with the GPL's source-code requirements.  That makes complaints about
copyright notices in the code being unwieldy lose some of their weight.
<p>
In the most recent discussion, Chris Mason <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/773539e2-b5f1-8386-aa2a-96086f198bf8@meta.com/">said</a>
the "<q>Christoph's request is well within the norms for the kernel</q>".
Sterba <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20221024171042.GF5824@suse.cz/">replied</a> that he
would consider changing the policy, but only as part of a wider policy
decision by the kernel project:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I've asked for recommendations or best practice similar to the SPDX
	process. Something that TAB can acknowledge and that is perhaps
	also consulted with lawyers. And understood within the linux
	project, not just that some dudes have an argument because it's all
	clear as mud and people are used to do things differently.
</blockquote>
<p>

It's not clear who Sterba has asked for recommendations at this point.
Chances are that he will find, over time, that the Btrfs subsystem's
position on copyright notices is not widely held across the project as a
whole.  Steve Rostedt arguably <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20221026074145.2be5ca09@gandalf.local.home/">described
the consensus view</a>: "<q>The policy is simple. If someone requires a
copyright notice for their code, you simply add it, or do not take their
code</q>".  In the absence of a decree from Linus Torvalds, though, the
issue of copyright notices may continue to be a source of disagreement.
Claiming copyright on a portion of a shared body of code can always be a
touchy matter, but it's one that developers can care a lot about.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why not make it an optional attachment to the authored tag? Would that work?<br>

Authored by: J Random Developer: (c) Fred Bloggs Ltd 2022<br>

That way it also shows up if somebody changes employ - the "author" line will change. Does git say "this line came from that patch"? So if they want the author, the copyright would show up at the same time.<br>

Git blame will tell you which patch last touched a line of code, but if you want to figure out who actually wrote something for copyright purposes, it's a bit more involved and messy. You don't want to see random code cleanup or other secondary activity - you want to know where the broad structure of a file or module came from, and that requires a human to review and understand the entire history of the file or files involved. Git does have the technical capability to show you that history, but it's labor-intensive and can't realistically be automated (at least, not without significant AI advancements, anyway).<br>
<p>
OTOH, copyright notices are not necessarily going to make that any easier. If the code says it is copyright Fred Bloggs Ltd, that is not necessarily true. It may have started out as a work by that company, and then over time, other individuals may have contributed to such an extent that the original would be unrecognizable. I'm dubious that a court would recognize a claim of copyright in those circumstances, but you'd have to ask a lawyer.<br>

<p>
Yup. if the lines have been re-written, mangled, diluted etc then there might be an argument over whether copyright has survived, but at least git shows clearly who contributed, what they contributed, and who owned the contribution.<br>
<p>
It at least removes some uncertainty - if my employer owns my contributions, then I leave but continue contributing to the project, I can't claim the contributions on my employers dime as my own (or vice versa - they can't claim mine from before I joined).<br>
<p>
The thing is, it makes a clear claim (a) of ownership, and (b) of what is owned. There's still going to be argument over whether it was worthy of copyright, and of whether enough of it survived to keep a valid copyright claim.<br>
<p>
But that would always be the case. This just reduces the amount of crap the lawyers can argue over.<br>

<p>They absolutely <b>do</b> make life much easier in cases like Hellwig's one.</p>

<p>Copyright notice clearly shows that code originates from something owned by the company or individual mentioned in these notices and then it becomes <b>problem for the other party</b> to prove that copyright notice is a lie.</p>

<p>It's not impossible, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_Laboratories,_Inc._v._Berkeley_Software_Design,_Inc.">have been done</a>, but it's very hard.</p>

<p>If there are no copyright notice, on the other hand, then there are no such presumption, then <b>you</b> have to prove that you actually wrote enough of the code to be entitled for the copyright protection.</p>

<p>Yes, it's basically just the question of “who pays the lawyer”, not question of what court would, ultimately, decide… but it's still very important distinction in practice.</p>

<p>
In a world where the cost of getting hauled into court is the long and short of some people's business model, you have a fiendishly sly sense of humor. [grin]<br>
<p>
I don't know about this question of copyright and who's going to be in a position to defend it, but if there's any possibility it makes the lawyer tax fall more heavily on somebody trying to misappropriate the code or the "embodied" IP, that seems like a pretty persuasive argument against Copyright-comment minimalism. The rest of everything everybody does in this country I live in, anyway, is in large part guided by lawyer-tax-avoidance considerations. Not having that make a noticeable mark on every commitdiff is almost quaint. [wink]<br>
<p>
Sorry; just being cynical. Please ignore if you're perturbed by me being so glib about such things, or if you're a lawyer.<br>

As the article briefly mentioned, the problem with relying on git is that it is only loosely tied to the source. I believe the GPL forbids (indirectly) stripping of copyright information on redistribution. US copyright laws also forbid this.<br>
<p>
Using git as the sole source of copyright attribution would render is inadvisable (or maybe even illegal) to distribute source tarballs (that did not include the full git history).<br>

But if the copyright is in the "authored by" tag, then the (meta)data only ever exists in git. So shipping a source tarball isn't stripping data that was never there.<br>
<p>
I hate to say it, but it's perfectly normal practice, when the reams of copyright headers get excessive, for them to be stripped from the live source and a note replaces them saying "look at the previous version for historic copyrights". <br>
<p>
Is it a criminal offence to strip notices, or just civil? If it's a civil offence, then you'd have to prove damages, and if it's not done with the intention of breaking copyrights, but only with the intention of making working with the code easier, that would be very hard to do.<br>

What I am saying is: if you have the git repo (that is acknowledged to have copyright attribution information) you are forbidden from shipping tarballs of just source off that (because that strips out the copyright information). <br>
<p>
Assuming all source tarballs come from git sources, shipping of source-only tarballs would be illegal (used loosely) at some point (though maybe not for simply redistributing the tarball you got).<br>
<p>
So let me clearly say "I am not a lawyer". With that out of the way, DMCA § 1204 provides for criminal charges (in some case, I recommend reading it for your self[1]). DMCA § 1203 provides for civil liabilities.<br>

<p>
Where is the difference if you strip a COPYRIGHT file that contains the copyright information or the .git folder that contains the copyright information? <br>
<p>
If I would add parts of the source code as git attributes (strange idea but possible) and then use a build script to extract and compile them. Would you say that it is perfectly valid to only distribute the parts of the source code that are in the files? Or does the mere fact that I put some of the code into git attributes enforce me to also include these when I distribute code? <br>
<p>
Is there a difference between code that is hidden in git attributes and copyright notices when it comes to what is allowed to be omitted and what is not allowed to be omitted when creating a source tarball?<br>
<p>

Criminal vs. civil, for copyright, is dependent on context.<br>
<p>
I understand that in some jurisdictions, copyright infringement is uniformly a matter of criminal law, while in others, whether copyright infringement constitutes a crime or a tort depends on things like "scale" and "commerciality". (And I dare say there's a jurisdiction somewhere out there where copyright infringement is purely a civil matter.) <br>

The US comes surprisingly close. Commercial copyright infringement is technically a criminal matter, but in practice the federal government has better things to do, so you would usually only get prosecuted if you make a nuisance of yourself and the (rather substantial) civil remedies are inadequate. See for example Kim Dotcom. But the vast majority of copyright infringement is either handled civilly or informally (i.e. without directly involving the court system, usually in the form of DMCA notices, as well as stuff like ContentID).<br>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, but I think it's criminal and not civil... however key words are &quot;fraudulent intent&quot;. Perhaps, if the intent is to declutter the source code and you have a good-faith reason to think git history is sufficient then there might be no issue. Maybe, it is best to not put yourself in situation where you have to explain intent in a court.</p>

I like the complicated hairball of the linux kernel copyrights, and I think everyone that has ever contributed deserves a copyright. Joint ownership of Linux has been the key to its staying power and growth. <br>
<p>
I'm  increasingly frustrated that any level of gpl enforcement against serial violators, particularly in the embedded market, has faded. Cambium and ubnt both stopped doing GPL drops a few years ago. So many "security" cams, so many other devices, so obviously based on linux, lacking GPL drops, also. <br>
<p>
Lacking GPL enforcement, it would be best for the world, if somehow those that are copying and going be strongly encouraged again to work within open source best practices. <br>

If I put a copyright notice to each file I have changed during my contribution to the Linux kernel, it will probably cover 20-25% of the entire code base (by file).

I would rather it read "The Linux kernel is collectively licensed under the GPLv2 with no 'copyright-owner' organization exception that can re-license it" or something to that effect. Ownership is entirely a matter of control, and if I have a git copy of Linux I own Linux, period, even if it was not licensed under GPLv2.

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; it seems that without ownership, there is nobody that can complain when the GPL gets violated</span><br>
<p>
Regarding this, I'm hoping something comes from SFC's enforcement suit against Vizio (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/895405/">https://lwn.net/Articles/895405/</a>). They're suing as a buyer of an affected device, not as a copyright owner. If they win this, owners of violating devices would have credible power against manufacturers even in the face of copyright owners who don't care - which, in the case of Linux, seems to be at least a significant minority (or maybe even the majority).<br>
<p>
Currently, all you can do as a user is say "pretty please" if the copyright owner doesn't care, and lots of companies get away with ignoring that. This would be a massive improvement in my book.<br>

Copyright is about copying/distribution not ownership. You can do what you like with the linux tree on your machine. If you want to build it with a GPL-incompatible driver (that you legally obtained) you can do it on your machine. The problem arises if you want to distribute the result (even if to just one other person). <br>

One of the rare cases I experienced where copyright mattered (outside of lawsuits) is if you want to change the license. For example, going from GPLv2-only to GPLv2+BSD. In that case you need to contact the copyright holders (where possible) to get approval for the change.<br>
<p>
We had that situation at least once in the media subsystem.<br>

Short of having git generate an automatic footer (sort of like CVS' $Id$) that tracks lines by contributor, and would possibly therefore automatically remove a *submitter* (not author) from the list if their lines go away, then there will always be missing copyright information from the kernel. When the GPL was first authored I don't think the current massively distributed and break-neck speed commit model was necessarily envisioned, and it's likely that there needs to be at some point legal recognition that the copyright information might be extraneous to the sources, with relevant pointers at the proper places. <br>
<p>
FWIW, git offers the "--author" flag for "commit". Maybe that'd be useful here?<br>

Hmm. Are you sure?<br>
<p>
From https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit :<br>
"--author=&lt;author&gt;<br>
<p>
    Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard A U Thor &lt;author@example.com&gt; format. Otherwise &lt;author&gt; is assumed to be a pattern and is used to search for an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=&lt;author&gt;); the commit author is then copied from the first such commit found."<br>

Am I misreading what this does? Note: I'm not a regular user of this functionality, so I might be missing the mark.<br>

And what everyone here is missing (and I made clear in my comment) you can NOT use the "author" commit to identify the copyright holder. You MUST EXplicitly specify the copyright holder if you want to know who the copyright holder is.<br>
<p>
A LOT of contributors do not own the copyright in their contributions. I've got a feeling I might soon need to sort out that mess in ScarletDME ...<br>

      I think the RAID5/6 problems in Btrfs persist because nobody has put in the time to fix them.  That is certainly a problem but a different one than the subject of this article; I wouldn't mix the two.

RAID 5/6 is broken because nobody with money or sufficient time cares enough about it anymore at this point.<br>
<p>
The only place hard drives really live these days is in network storage devices, which do their own redundancy locally, often as some sort of cluster. If you're using local disks they're going to be high performance SSDs, in RAID 10 because the overhead of calculating parity at those speeds would be too high anyway.<br>
<p>
So at this point the only one you've got left is enthusiasts building a DIY NAS at home, who have enough time on their hands to just deal with the inconveniences of dealing with ZFS anyway.<br>
<p>
So unless some brand new use case for RAID 5/6 appears from somewhere, I don't think this will change even under the friendliest maintainership.<br>

Storage stacks have always taken a shockingly long time to mature, often a decade or two, and require a massive number of users to chase out the bugs which cause data loss or corruption but only have a rate of incidence of once per century/host or less.<br>
<p>
The reality is that neither the user base or commercial financial interest is present to mature reed-solomon codes for a single node storage solution. Evidence of this is that RedHat has dropped support in RHEL for btrfs completely. Mid to large scale organizations have either outsourced the problem to "the cloud" or they use a distributed storage system that has erasure-codes and/or replicas spread across multiple nodes. Single host storage solutions are simply too unreliable to be trusted with important data.  <br>

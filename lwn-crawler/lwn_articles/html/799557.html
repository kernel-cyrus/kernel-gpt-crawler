<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2019-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
<p>
In the <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/40/#all">Kernel Summit
track</a> at the
<a href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/">2019
Linux Plumbers Conference</a>, Christian Brauner and Kees Cook led a
discussion on finding a way to do deep argument inspection for seccomp
filtering.  Currently, seccomp filters can only look at the top-level
arguments to a system call, which means that there are use cases that
cannot be supported.  There was a lively discussion in the session, but no
definitive conclusion was reached; various ideas were considered, but none
seemed to quite fit the bill.
</p>

<p>
Cook said that the current seccomp filters can only inspect the system-call argument
values; if one of those values is a pointer, dereferencing it will not
work.  Even if it were possible to do so, 
another thread could change the values after the
check is done.  That is a classic time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU)
race.  Programs that are using the filters would like to be able to filter
based on file name arguments to restrict which files the programs can
access, for example, but that is currently not possible.
</p>

<p>
A more pressing use case is
that new system calls are using an API pattern that puts various parameters
(flags, in particular) into a structure, as <a href="/Articles/792628/">with
<tt>clone3()</tt></a>, Brauner said. The address of that structure gets passed to the
call along with its size, but the parameters in the structure are
off-limits to filters.  The idea behind the pattern is to enable 
additions to the API over time; the structure can be extended and the size
of the structure will grow so the system call will be able to recognize
when it is called with extra parameters that it does not understand.
</p>

<p>
Both passive and active filtering of, say, <tt>open()</tt> calls are also
affected, Cook said, so even simply logging file names as part of a passive
filtering effort is not reliable.  The value for the file name that the
filter sees may not be the 
value that actually reaches the system call.  The <a
href="/Articles/756233/">user-space seccomp decisions feature</a> makes it
possible for programs like container managers to reliably handle system
calls but, since they cannot filter for only those they are interested in,
they have to implement those system calls for every call; there is no way
to tell the kernel to simply continue handling the system call once it has been
deferred to user space.
</p>

<h4>System-call flow</h4>

</a>

<p>
The <a
href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/560/attachments/397/640/deep-arg-inspection.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a> for the session had what Cook called an "eye chart" for
system-call flow that was part of the background information for attendees.
After the system call enters the kernel, various 
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a>
entry hooks are called, which may block the program while another process,
such as a 
debugger, examines, and possibly changes, the call.
Anything about the call be changed, including the system-call number or its
arguments; the hook can also request that the system call be skipped.
</p>

<p>
After that, the seccomp hooks are called, which can result in a wide
variety of outcomes, Cook said.  They can kill the thread or process, skip
the system call, log the call, send a signal to the calling process, defer
the decision to user space, or generate
<tt>ptrace()</tt> events.  In the latter case, the <tt>ptrace()</tt> hooks
may, once again, change anything, including the system-call number, which
means the seccomp filter code needs to be run again.  As a kind of a hack,
further recursion is disallowed after one iteration of that, he said.
</p>

<p>
Next, the actual system-call code is reached; it copies the
user-space memory into kernel memory for parsing into kernel objects.  At
that point, the Linux security module (LSM) hooks are called, which can
only make a simple accept or reject decision.  If it is accepted, the
system-call code then operates on the kernel objects to perform its
function. Then the <tt>ptrace()</tt> exit hooks are called and, finally,
the call returns to user space.
</p>

<p>
Both the <tt>ptrace()</tt> and seccomp hooks are in the wrong place to do
deterministic checks of system calls, he said.  Until the arguments are
copied in the system-call function itself, they can be changed by other
threads, either mistakenly or as part of an attack.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the LSM hooks are in the right place, but the LSM
interface is not meant for system-call filtering.  The LSM hooks are
higher-level abstractions that are shared between system callsâ€”the same
hook can be called from multiple system calls.  However, the recent
addition of the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/SafeSetID.html">SafeSetID
LSM</a> has changed the situation somewhat; it can distinguish between
system calls that seek to change user
ID versus those that change the group ID.  But, as yet and perhaps
forever, there are no allowances for unprivileged LSMs, so the Chrome
browser, for example, could not load an LSM to filter its system calls.
</p>

<p>
Cook wondered if it makes sense to do deep inspection of system-call
arguments via seccomp at all.  If you really want to inspect file names or
IP addresses, the LSM layer makes more logical sense since the kernel
objects of interest are available there.  Doing filtering
based on system calls makes it possible for user space to get sloppy and
only filter <tt>open()</tt> and ignore <tt>rename()</tt> for example.
</p>

<h4>Other possibilities</h4>

<p>
Cook said that he explored finding a way to make an association between
seccomp and an LSM of some sort.
It was looking like a "really scary" solution that was overly complex with
a lot of
layering violations.  Another way
forward might be to move the seccomp hooks; the ABI says they have to be
done after the <tt>ptrace()</tt> hooks so that means they could be pushed
deeper into the system-call path.  But there is a problem with that too:
adding a hook to every system-call function feels completely wrong to him,
for one thing.
</p>

<p>
Another thought was to move the copying of the arguments to earlier in the
system-call path; the actual system call could use that cached copy rather
than doing the copying itself.  The problem is that things like path-name
resolution may result in different kernel objects at the two different
points, which still leaves a race condition.
</p>

<p>
Yet another idea would be to have system calls declare their argument types
more completely so that the parsing of the arguments and, if needed,
conversion to kernel 
objects could be done early in the system call path.  For many system calls, this would
be fairly straightforward, but path-name resolution is significantly more
complex, for example.  Beyond
that, some system calls do things like walk lists of structures in user
space, which is messy to handle; "the logic for that is really terrible".
</p>

<a href="/Articles/799798/">

alt="[Christian Brauner]" title="Christian Brauner" width=212 height=270>
</a>

<p>
Brauner said that they had come to the realization that allowing deep
argument inspection in a generic way, for every system call, is probably
not the right way forward.  There is a set of system calls that are of
most interest to user space for filtering for security purposes.  He
thought those could probably be handled separately unless someone has a
great idea for how to solve the problem generically.
</p>

<p>
He asked the assembled kernel developers if a piecemeal approach made
sense by adding support for individual system calls.  Aleksa Sarai said
that it did make sense but he wanted to know how user space would be able
to detect which system calls are supported.  Cook said, "yet another
problem", with a chuckle.  Some way for the kernel to mark system calls as
having that ability will be needed, Brauner said; that was suggested on the
mailing list by Andy Lutomirski, he said.
</p>

<p>
An attendee said that the session made it clear that the filtering is being
done in the wrong place, at least for filtering based on kernel objects,
such as file handles rather than path names.  The LSM hooks are in the
right place and have access to the right objects, so some things should be
done with seccomp and others with an LSM, they said.  If you want to work
with file objects, for example, that would have to be done in an LSM.
</p>

<p>
Cook agreed that filtering is happening in the wrong place, but the
alternatives don't seem all that palatable either.  The <a
href="/Articles/703876/">Landlock LSM</a> project is working on ways to have
unprivileged code be able to configure a sandbox by attaching eBPF programs
to the LSM hooks.  But that approach exposes LSM internals that the LSM
developers are not comfortable exposing.  In addition, doing system-call
filtering would mean that the LSM hooks need to have a way to determine
what system call invoked them, which is not something they have now (except
in the limited SafeSetID case) and runs counter to the idea behind the LSM hooks.
</p>

<p>
H. Peter Anvin said that he disagreed that seccomp filtering was being done
in the wrong place.  Moving the filtering deeper in the system-call path
will simply expose more attack surface.  He acknowledged that means that
seccomp filtering cannot do all of what people would like it to do, but
that isn't necessarily a problem. 
</p>

<p>
From his perspective, Brauner said that path-based filtering is not really
required and that grafting it onto seccomp filtering seems wrong at some
level.  But there remains a need to be able to filter based on things like
flags arguments that are inside structures.  Others seemed to agree that
handling kernel objects should be left to the LSMs, while arguments such as
flags make sense for seccomp.
</p>

<p>
An attendee wondered why LSM plus eBPF was not "just the answer".  Cook said
that part of the problem is that there is no unprivileged way to do either
right now.  It was his hope that attaching eBPF programs to LSM hooks would
make its way into the kernel, thus saving seccomp from having to solve the
deep argument inspection problem.  There are still a lot of discussions
about how that would work and both <a href="/Articles/796328/">unprivileged
eBPF</a> and unprivileged LSMs have met resistance from their maintainers.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, attaching eBPF to LSMs gives user space a way to create
"gadgets" that can be used in timing attacks of various kinds, an attendee
said.  That makes it hard to get the security parameters of the 
feature right.  The LSM developers are also concerned about leaking their
internal state via the eBPF programs that could be attached.
</p>

<p>
Right now, just figuring out where the inspection would be done would be a
start, Cook said.  Then there are more questions of how the filtering would
be hooked up to it and so on.  In addition, there are the upstreaming issues,
Brauner said.  Toward the end, Cook said that he was hoping that someone
would have a great idea that they had not thought of to solve the problem
neatly, but it would appear that is not the case.  It is a problem that
arises frequently, though, especially in its simplest form (e.g. filtering on flag
values), so it seems likely that we have not heard the last of it.

Foresight? I think Windows NT inherited that idea from VAX/VMS. Remember that, way back when, Microsoft hired the head VMS guy from Digital to work on Windows NT; accordingly, Windows NT, when it was new, had a lot in common with VMS.

If there's a TOCTTOU (time if call to time of use) race, then I'd love to use something like RCU to record "you called with this, it changed on the way" for diagnosis of what *really* was executed vs what the user (and sysadmin-approved system services) thought they caused to happen. There's a security implication to catching intended versus actual activity, right?<br>

If we go with the "cached" proposal (where we do argument parsing earlier and within seccomp) then the copied struct that was seccomp-filtered will be re-used for the actual syscall body (precisely to avoid the obvious TOCTTOU attacks).<br>

It seems like this would be a good idea irrespective of seccomp, just in case a future syscall that follows the pattern of clone3 ever looks twice at the same parameter and expects it to stay the same.<br>

<p>
system calls copy the user-space arguments before they start using them; after that point, user space can no longer change them (and affect the system call) ... the caching idea would just move that copying earlier in the system-call flow ...<br>

Not to mention that there are dozens of syscalls that already take structs as arguments, so this definitely isn't a new problem we have to worry about. Calling copy_struct_from_user() on the same buffer twice -- or (heaven forbid) doing get_user() directly -- in a proposed syscall body would definitely result in a NACK from at least a few reviewers.<br>

Come to think about it, what if there's a generic layer in front of syscalls/ioctls that would copy the arguments from userspace and marshall them into nice eBPF-friendly structures with type information. And then simply route them across the layers.<br>
<p>
Some syscalls like clone3() are already doing the right thing, so for them it'd be a trivial wrapper. For other syscalls custom code will have to be written.<br>
<p>
This can also be done incrementally. I doubt sandboxes care much about arguments for vm86 syscall, they would just filter it out entirely.<br>

My understanding was that this was discussed (and dismissed as too difficult) in the two paragraphs in the article starting with "Yet another idea would be to have system calls declare their argument types more completely so that the parsing of the arguments and, if needed, conversion to kernel objects could be done early in the system call path."?<br>

The article says that the Landlock approach "exposes LSM internals that the LSM developers are not comfortable exposing."<br>
<p>
Which LSM internals are that, which they aren't comfortable exposing? (Sorry, I must have missed the discussion.) Is that a concern for other proposed LSMs as well?<br>

From what I understood, the primary concern of "exposing internals" is that the implementation details of the LSM hook infrastructure might become a user-space ABI (and thus must not be broken). Currently, LSM hooks can be redesigned within the kernel because all of the LSM hook users are also in-kernel. If you allow eBPF programs to be attached as LSM hooks, then you can no longer redesign the API as easily because you will break user-space unless you provide backwards-compatible shims.<br>
<p>
And note that Linus recently said he feels that eBPF *tracepoints* are an ABI[1].<br>

      It would even be handy if <tt>argv[k]</tt> could be readily inspected during the LSM processing for <tt>execve</tt>.  Today this is possible but cumbersome using tomoyo_security.  Instead, <tt>remove_arg_zero()</tt> in fs/exec.c could return into a buffer what it removed.  The entire <tt>argv[]</tt> could be restored by remembering and resetting the original string pointer and count before any calls to <tt>remove_arg_zero()</tt>.

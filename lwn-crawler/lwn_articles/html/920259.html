Code that is added to the kernel can stay there for a long time; there is
code in current kernels that has been present for over 30&nbsp;years.
Nothing is forever, though.  The kernel development community is currently
discussing the removal of two architectures and one filesystem, all of
which seem to have mostly fallen out of use.  But, as we will see, removal
of code from the kernel is not easy and is subject to reconsideration even
after it happens.
<p>
<h4>Not-so-SuperH</h4>
<p>
Hitachi's SuperH architecture dates back to the 1990s; it is a 32-bit
processor that was intended for embedded applications.  Support for SuperH
was first added (in minimal form) to the kernel in the 2.3.16 release in
September 1999. 
While it was popular for some years after its introduction, SuperH was eventually
eclipsed by Arm.  SuperH processors are still <a
href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/other-mcus-mpus/superh-risc-engine-family-mcus">produced
by Renesas</a>, but they are not recommended for use in new designs.
<p>
Around 2015 there was <a href="/Articles/647636/">an attempt</a> to
reinvigorate this architecture, inspired by the fact that the patents
covering its design were expiring.  The result was <a
href="https://j-core.org/">a design</a> for a processor called the J-Core
J2, which was intended to be built as entirely open hardware.  J2 did not
really take off, though, perhaps because interest in 32-bit processors was
fading quickly in those times; the <a
href="https://j-core.org/news.html">J-Core news page</a> was last updated
in 2016.   <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/7329212f-b1a0-41eb-99b3-a56eb1d23138@landley.net/">This
message</a> from Rob Landley suggests that this project is not entirely
dead.  Still, despite the appeal of 
an entirely open processor, it does not appear that J-Core will be the
salvation of the SuperH architecture.
<p>
More recently, Christoph Hellwig posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230113062339.1909087-1-hch@lst.de/">a patch
series</a> removing support for the SuperH architecture from the kernel,
saying:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	arch/sh has been a long drag because it supports a lot of SOCs, and
	most of them haven't even been converted to device tree
	infrastructure.  These SOCs are generally obsolete as well, and all
	of the support has been barely maintained for almost 10 years, and
	not at all for more than 1 year.
</blockquote>
<p>
John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/11e2e0a8-eabe-2d8c-d612-9cdd4bcc3648@physik.fu-berlin.de/">objected</a>
to this removal, noting that he is still maintaining the Debian SuperH
port.  "<q>It's a bit disappointing that people keep hammering on it. It
works fine for me.</q>"  Geert Uytterhoeven <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAMuHMdUcnP6a9Ch5=_CMPq-io-YWK5pshkOT2nZmP1hvNcwBAg@mail.gmail.com/">added</a>
that the problem with SuperH isn't really a lack of users or even
developers creating patches, it's the fact that there is no maintainer to
apply those patches.
<p>
A likely outcome to this discussion is that Glaubitz, along with 
Landley, will try to take over maintenance of the kernel's SuperH port.
They will have their work cut out for them; among other things, SuperH
needs a proper conversion to use device trees and the removal of support
for many obsolete CPUs and boards.  But, if the new maintainers can get
SuperH back on track, its days in the kernel may not be numbered quite yet.
<p>
<h4>The last sinking of the Itanic</h4>
<p>
In the late 1990s, there was a lot of talk of Intel's new processor
architecture, which was known by the codename "Merced" at the time.  This
CPU was going to be the future of computing, it would be so much better
that it would quickly
dethrone x86.  But details about Merced were scarce, and it was not at
all clear that there would be enough information available to create a
Linux port for this architecture.  There were widespread worries that, by
denying access to information on Merced, Intel and Microsoft would sideline
Linux just as it was beginning to gain some real commercial momentum.
<p>
Needless to say, that is not what happened.  Intel, instead, <a
href="/1998/1001/">became an early investor in Red Hat</a> in 1998.  When
Merced, later branded "Itanium", hit the market, Linux had first-class
support for it.  The Itanium (ia64) architecture first showed up in the 2.3.43
development kernel release in early 2000.  Working Itanium processors took
somewhat longer and, by the time they were widely available, they had long
since been surpassed by x86-64, initially developed by AMD.  Itanium was
never a successful product line and no Itanium CPUs are manufactured now.
<p>
Itanium support remains in the kernel, though, but it's not clear how much
longer that will last.  The most recent discussion about its future
happened as a result of <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAGudoHHx0Nqg6DE70zAVA75eV-HXfWyhVMWZ-aSeOofkA_=WdA@mail.gmail.com/">this
patch</a> from Mateusz Guzik, who had tracked down a locking performance
problem that, seemingly, originated in a <tt>cpu_relax()</tt> call that is
only needed by the Itanium architecture.  That led Tony Luck, once a
maintainer of that architecture in the kernel, to <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/SJ1PR11MB6083368BCA43E5B0D2822FD3FCC29@SJ1PR11MB6083.namprd11.prod.outlook.com/">ask</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Is it time yet for:
<p>
	$ git rm -r arch/ia64
</blockquote>
<p>
Ard Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAMj1kXEqbMEcrKYzz2-huLPMnotPoxFY8adyH=Xb4Ex8o98x-w@mail.gmail.com/">concurred</a>,
noting that he is unable to do any sort of testing to ensure that EFI
changes work on the Itanium architecture.  On the other hand, <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/Y8HDzzDaP5uY0v8K@Jessicas-MacBook-Pro/">Jessica
Clarke</a> and <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/db6937a1-e817-2d7b-0062-9aff012bb3e8@physik.fu-berlin.de/">Glaubitz</a>
both pointed out that Debian has a working Itanium port; Glaubitz added
that Gentoo also supports the architecture.  Luck <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/SJ1PR11MB60832EF4EA3D528533100F8DFCC29@SJ1PR11MB6083.namprd11.prod.outlook.com/">suggested</a>
that keeping these systems going was a wasted effort:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Are there people actually running production systems on ia64 that
	also update to v6.x kernels?
<p>
	If so, why? Just scrap the machine and replace with almost anything
	else.  You'll cover the cost of the new machine in short order with
	the savings on your power bill.
</blockquote>
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/53F2E30D-FE1D-4710-B5FC-049905A7158E@jrtc27.com/">answer</a>
was "hobbyists", who like keeping such systems running.  Biesheuvel <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAMj1kXH1SjPrPWyQbsYUHhVfgWH_p-sf-mhbeKMQn-QyOjBRng@mail.gmail.com/">sympathized</a>
with the hobbyists, but asked:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	However, the question is not how you or I choose to spend (or
	waste) their time. The question is whether it is reasonable *as a
	community* to insist that everyone who contributes a
	cross-architecture change also has to ensure that obsolete
	architectures such as ia64 or alpha are not left behind.
</blockquote>
<p>
He pointed to the original topic of the thread as an example: locking was
being slowed as the result of an Itanium-specific problem, so developers
need to find a way to speed up the locking that doesn't introduce
regressions on a processor that nobody has access to.  Or perhaps not: Luck
<a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/SJ1PR11MB6083B48A2B2114EF833D69E2FCC29@SJ1PR11MB6083.namprd11.prod.outlook.com/">suggested</a>
how such a fix could be structured, but Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=wgTsc5z3cPo7+t2kRO1uRQML1w_o72nefyHOh8VMhqu0A@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>
that it simply wasn't worth the effort.
<p>
Nobody yet has yet said that Itanium support can actually be removed,
so it is not clear when that will happen.  Sooner seems more likely than
later, though.  As developers stop even their minimal support for this
architecture, it will fade into an increasingly unmaintainable state.
Support for this unloved architecture has been in the kernel for
23&nbsp;years; it's not likely to stay for many more.
<p>
<h4>JFS</h4>
<p>
Once upon a time, journaling was the hot new feature for filesystems, and
Linux didn't have any filesystems that supported it; system administrators
had to be far more familiar with the <tt>fsck</tt> tool than is normally
required now.  That hole was first
filled by ReiserFS, which was merged for the 2.4.0.4 in early February
2002.  But it was quickly followed by JFS, which entered the kernel less
than three weeks later.  JFS came out of IBM and was the main filesystem
for the AIX operating system; it, too, supported journaling.
<p>
JFS never become one of the top Linux filesystems, though it did pop up
here and there; the <a href="https://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> project
still suggests it in various places in its documentation.  But JFS has not
seen any real development for years and it's not clear that there are many
users left.  Hellwig, pointing out that JFS will
slow down the <a href="/Articles/893512/">folio conversion</a> effort, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y8DvK281ii6yPRcW@infradead.org/">asked</a> whether
it should just be removed.
<p>
This filesystem seems to have few defenders.  Dave Kleikamp, who originally
added it in 2002 and who is still listed as its maintainer, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f99e5221-4493-dba3-3e80-e85ada6b3545@oracle.com/">responded</a>:
"<q>Obviously, I haven't put much effort into JFS in a long time and I
would not miss it if it were to be removed</q>".  No patches doing the
removal have been posted but, in the absence of an impassioned defense of
JFS from somewhere, one can expect it to, at a minimum, be marked as
orphaned in the near future.
<p>
<h4>The zombie pktcdvd driver</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_writing">Packet writing</a>
is a protocol that can be used for the writing of recordable optical media
(younger readers should ask their parents about optical media; it used to
be important).  The kernel
gained support for packet writing in late 2004.  As of 2016, though, the
pktcdvd
driver was unmaintained and unloved; the regular block drivers had long
since gained the ability to drive all optical devices, and the
packet-writing driver, it seemed, was no longer needed.  It was <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/5a8b187c61e9">marked deprecated</a> in
the 4.10 release with a promise that it would be removed "<q>after a
release or two</q>".
<p>
A full 33 releases later, this driver was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f40eb99897af">actually removed</a>
during the 6.2 merge window.  That, however, led to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230104190115.ceglfefco475ev6c@pali/">a
complaint</a> from Pali Rohár, who said:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
This 6.2-rc1 release is breaking support for CD-RW, DVD-RW,
DVD+RW and partially also DVD-RAM medias because of pktcdvd driver
removal from the kernel in this release.
	Driver is still used and userspace tools for it are part of the
	udftools project, which is still under active maintenance. More
	people already informed me about this "surprise".
</blockquote>
<p>

Both <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wh1x-gbmE72xBPcEnchvmPn=13mU--+7Cfay0dNHCxxuw@mail.gmail.com/">Torvalds</a>
and block subsystem maintainer <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/90eb90da-2679-cac0-979d-6ba0cc8ccbb8@kernel.dk/">Jens
Axboe</a> questioned the need for this driver, but it became clear that it
still provides some functionality (specifically ensuring that all writes
are exactly 32KB in size) that projects like udftools need.  So <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b83e99ee709">pktcdvd came back</a>.
There was some talk of putting the necessary logic into the SCSI CD driver,
but, as Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjJ=wD5D80hkWNCjJqS+djckAL+nXhXaHaiFzMAMve3rA@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>,
"<q>nobody is going to be motivated to do any development in this area, and
the best we can do is probably to just keep it limping along</q>".  If, at
some point, this driver fails to limp properly, developers may start
considering its removal again.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I have a ton of old stuff that I keep running, but I also keep it running on the same OS I last used with it (or could get to work on it). Pulling support for an architecture isn't a death knell, it's just a constraint on progress- Progress that is generally unusable for the old stuff anyhow.<br>

Because maybe they are USERS, not programmers?<br>
<p>
That is why FLOSS hasn't taken over the world. It's BY programmers, FOR programmers.<br>
<p>
As someone who isn't Computer Science trained, and who likes software that actually works FOR USERS (hello WordPerfect, hello Pick), many of the people who *use* this stuff don't have the *appropriate* skill set to maintain it.<br>
<p>
Stuff that appeals to Comp Sci (hello Unix, hello relational) gets all the mind share, never mind the fact that it's pretty crap at doing it's job, hey it's cheap to train students on, and then they take it into business because it's what they know.<br>

But FLOSS has taken over the world...? I'm not sure why you imply it hasn't. At least in terms of architecture, basically the entire developed world and most of the developing world is walking around with at least one UNIX-style kernel in their pocket or purse. Probably multiple.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the question in this article is whether it makes sense for modern kernels to continue to support these platforms in new versions. Existing versions still continue to be around. WordPerfect still works fine on DOS. (George R. R. Martin still uses WordStar on DOS, in fact! He's not a programmer, but he is by any measure a remarkably successful user of a text editor.) The sensible thing for hobbyists who want to use platforms that no longer have active support is to use old versions of the software. It's more likely to work well, since it was written at a time when those platforms were more popular, and it feels more within the spirit of retrocomputing too.<br>
<p>
And one of the benefits of FLOSS is that licenses are free and indefinite. It's probably hard for me to legally get a licensed copy of WordPerfect for DOS today, if I don't already have one, but it's absolutely straightforward for me to legally get a licensed copy of Linux 2.2 or Debian 5 or whatever.<br>
<p>
(You can also do exactly what people do with non-FLOSS software and pay for development. Becoming a programmer is not the only way to keep maintaining software; you can also make money in some other way and then hire a programmer to do it. And spending money on hobbies is a very common and natural thing for people to do!)<br>

      <font class="QuotedText">&gt; But FLOSS has taken over the world...?</font>

<p>I would say it differently: “freeware managed to deflect attack of proprietary software”.</p>

<p>Long time ago, long before “free software”, “open source” and “FLOSS” terms were invented the majority of software around was free — and it was often coming with source.</p>

<p>Then proprietary software arrived and at some point it looked as if free software would be gone.</p>

<p>But free-as-in-beer software fought back and it, eventually, become obvious that the best way to provide free-as-in-beer software is to make it “open source”.</p>

<p>How much actual FLOSS software that is sold for $$ do you know?</p>

<p>People have just realised that if you are not selling software anyway then keeping source closed is of little benefit for you and you would be better of keeping it open.</p>

<p>But the “FLOSS has taken over the world” was always about free beer, not about free speech.</p>

<p>Exceptions exist, sure, but they are so rare you would dig hard to find them. And they mostly exist to complement the other, free-as-in-beer software.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; At least in terms of architecture, basically the entire developed world and most of the developing world is walking around with at least one UNIX-style kernel in their pocket or purse.</font>

<p>Yes. Because it became cheaper to buy lots of RAM said software needs than to pay royalties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX">for the more efficient one</a>.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; And spending money on hobbies is a very common and natural thing for people to do!</font>

<p>Programmers are in high demand and this wouldn't, really work, very few afford to pay a competent programmer to do anything for them if that's just a hobby.</p>

You're forgetting something. GNU, and all that, WERE LATE TO THE GAME.<br>
<p>
Even the history of GNU tells you that - RMS started writing open software, because he was there at the transition from open to closed. When he started at MIT, all the software he used WAS OPEN. And then suddenly the printer manufacturer shipped a CLOSED printer driver.<br>
<p>
Computing was around long before RMS - and before RMS went to MIT it *was* mostly both free-as-in-beer, and open-as-in-you-got-the-source. That only changed with the IBM anti-trust lawsuit.<br>
<p>
I just missed that era - there's loads of stuff I knew was out there and would have loved to have got my hands on... only snag is, reading a 9-track tape is difficult when most of the drives disappeared late last century ...<br>

<p>Find better books, then?</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The history of GNU is due to the ooposite, i.e. impossibility to get the source code for something…</font>

<p>Indeed. That infamous <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html">printer story</a>.</p>

<p>Stallman have found the lack of sourse so strange, so appalling, so shocking… why do you think he though so? Because he dealt with binaries all the time, but felt that in <b>this</b> one particular case people would give him source? Is that… logical?</p>

<p>Or think about USSR and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ES_EVM">IBM 360</a> clones. Would it make any sense to clone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">IBM 360</a> if not for the easy availability of program? And most were coming with source. Or look on this <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/pc/at/1502494_PC_AT_Technical_Reference_Mar84.pdf#page=165">IBM 5170 manual</a>. <b>It comes with full commented source of it's BIOS</b>. And that's <b>after</b> RMS's <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html">announcement</a> of GNU project.</p>

<p>The goal was declared not as “source available software prosper”, but to “stop that onslaught of proprietary software”!</p>

<p>And that goal looked <b>realistic</b> back then: closed source software was rare, most software was coming with sources <b>anyway</b> (Microsoft BASIC wasn't shipped with sources, but if you would <a href="https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150/early/5150_early.htm">look on motherboard of IBM 5150</a> you would find out that it had it in physically separate ROMs and you may even desolder these and system would still work)! And <b>that</b> was why it's sources were not included: the explanation was that most hardware and software developers may ignore existence of it, it's not essential system component, thus there are no need to include detailed explanations about hot it works.</p>

<p>FSF was never about making FLOSS successful! Stallman perceived free software as natural, in fact he <b>haven't even realized</b> that he was already using proprietary software without readily-available sources before that infamous printer story and thus he wanted to kill that newfanged <b>and rare</b> proprietary software!</p>

<p>I have <b>no</b> idea what books you have read, but it's hard for me to believe the level of ignorance needed to portray years of 1983-1984 (time when GNU project was started) as time where free software is rare.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite: years 1983-1984 were when proprietary software have just begun appearing (actually it started happened earlier, but people living in ivory towers of mainframes haven't noticed immediately) and it was starting to become popular (which they noticed)… <b>that</b> is what made Stallman angry and afraid. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">Macintosh</a> (which included large amount of software in it's ROM that <b>wasn't included with sources in the manual</b>) that was herald of the new era! This would prompt Stallman to, much later, write <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/richard-m-stallman-on-steve-jobs-im-not-glad-hes-dead-but-im-glad-hes-gone/"> Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died</a> (which caused such an outrage at the time, but I think Stallman truly believes that if not for Jobs quite successful job at closing the software then we wouldn't have so much proprietary software today… he is probably right there).</p>

<p>Just <b>what</b> book have you read that teach different things? And <b>how</b> may people forget recent history so quickly?</p>

The problem is, for many people, it IS history. And how many people are interested in history?<br>

The generation who lived through that history (mine) is on the verge of disappearing from the workforce. And then there will be nobody who remembers that history, and nobody who has bothered to learn it ...<br>

<p>Not many which is precisely what I'm talking about.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; And then there will be nobody who remembers that history, and nobody who has bothered to learn it ...</font>

<p>And then civilisation would collapse. It's as simple as that.</p>

<p><i>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it</i>.</p>

<p>If you don't study mistakes which happened in the past you would do the same ones in the present. And if there are too many ones who are laser-focused on present and not enough of these who remember the past then society integrity unravels.</p>

<p>It happened before and it would happen again, I'm just surprised it's happening so fast these days.</p>

<p>I wasn't around in the era when the majority of the software was free, but when I do something, I try to study the history of field to understand why certain decisions were made and whether choices made back then still make any sense today.</p>

<p>But there are so many people who don't bother… it's scary. Like: really scary. We have built a technogenic civilisation which needs people with deep understanding to survive, yet we have built a society, on top of that civilisation, which produces ignoramuses.</p>

<p>Why have that happened? Can this trend be reversed? IDK. But if it wouldn't be reversed then there would be collapse. It's as simple as that.</p>

<p>Stallman tried to reverse one scary part and partially succeeded, thus it's not all gloom and doom, but with how little people pay attention to history… I'm not at all hopeful.</p>

Also you have to remember that folk memory and what actually happened are usually very different ...<br>
<p>
My wife says I'm English - fine. But that's my father's side of the family that I barely remember after the age of 10. The only relatives I (rarely) saw were my grandfather and step-grandmother.<br>
<p>
I consider myself European/German/Scottish/White-Jamaican. And that's just what I know about. Go back a few generations and most people will probably discover they are not who they thought they were. Especially in Europe. And isn't America known as "the great melting pot"?<br>
<p>
Since I started discovering Scottish history, I've discovered much of my English folk history is pretty far from the truth (not to say the Scottish history is accurate) - to see things from both sides (likewise WWI) is, shall we say, eye-opening!<br>

It depends on how big lies are put into the books. We all know that most of the Soviet books WRT history are BS and full of lies. The question is, where did you get the solid source for the information? Especially if you need to cross-check / double check it.<br>

The era of proprietary software for small/hobbyist computers is generally considered to start in the mid-1970s with Microsoft's BASIC interpreter for the MITS Altair 8800 computer. The culture at the time was for software to be liberally shared all over the place, but Bill Gates famously took exception to people distributing self-made copies of the program to their friends and acquaintances because he expected that they would pay for it.
</p>
<p>
The Apple II I used in the early 1980s came with a listing of the basic ROM – in 6502 assembly language – in the “technical reference” manual (which also included circuit diagrams and other fairly detailed explanations of how the computer worked) but of course not with sources for the (Microsoft-provided) BASIC interpreter. ISTR that there was a long(ish) article series in one of the Apple user magazines that disassembled and explained at least part of that code.
But at that time, while there was a lot of code in BASIC floating around, it was absolutely normal for proprietary software such as games or business applications for the Apple II to be sold without source code, and often with more or less deviously manipulated distribution media to discourage illicit copying.

<p>Which was, of course, only needed because people perceived sharing normal and expected. You wouldn't need to thwart sharing if it wouldn't have happened naturally!</p>

<p>But the watershed moment was Mac: it was the first computer which not only haven't included assembly listings for essential parts of it's basic ROM as delivered from factory, but it was first computer where you <b>have</b> to use that proprietary software to do <b>anything</b>.</p>

<p>That “it's just a luxury extra addon, that's why you are not entitled to see source” story disappeared.</p>

<p>
I don't buy that. The Commodore 64 for example, which was very popular indeed and predates the Macintosh by several years, certainly didn't come with a manual that included ROM listings, and its proprietary BASIC interpreter (from Microsoft) was what you used to do “anything” with the machine. Remember that these machines didn't have a separate OS as such, so the BASIC interpreter did that job, too. (The Apple II had a primitive “machine language monitor” which one might have used to do non-BASIC stuff, but that would have put one at a fairly exalted level of geekdom. You'd still have to use a BASIC command to enter the monitor.) Other similar computers included the Sinclair ZX80/81 or the TI 99/4A, and IIRC none of them featured ROM listings in their documentation, nor allowed you to do anything much without using their proprietary software – usually a BASIC interpreter doubling up as the OS.
</p>
<p>
In fact, even the ROM listing in the Apple II manual was widely regarded at the time as quaint. In any case it covered only 4 kibibytes of ROM but took up a considerable part of the book. The first Macintosh came with 64 kibibytes of ROM and a listing of that would have been quite the hefty tome and probably not <em>that</em> useful to much of the target audience. (Note that the Apple II was marketed to people who were interested in computers, while the Macintosh was marketed to people who were interested in getting useful stuff done on computers without being interested in computers as such.)

<p>It's weird half-thing. It doesn't include ROM listings, but all the data structures are <a href="https://www.commodore.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/c64-programmers_reference_guide-05-basic_to_machine_language.pdf#page=102">carefully documented</a>. In a sense they follow the advice (<i>Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.</i>) and reveal the important thing while keeping the right to change the actual code.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; and its proprietary BASIC interpreter (from Microsoft) was what you used to do “anything” with the machine</font>

<p>Then why would they include <a href="https://www.commodore.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/c64-programmers_reference_guide-05-basic_to_machine_language.pdf#page=2">description of machine language there</a> and all these other things? Maybe you have confused it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A">TA-99A</a>. That one, indeed, tries to constrict you, and it predates Mac, but it was never “cool”, I think “failed experiment” would be better name for that attempt.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Remember that these machines didn't have a separate OS as such, so the BASIC interpreter did that job, too.</font>

<p>Nope. That was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KERNAL">KERNAL</a>'s job (and, later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)">GEOS</a>, but that was after Mac).</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Other similar computers included the Sinclair ZX80/81 or the TI 99/4A, and IIRC none of them featured ROM listings in their documentation, nor allowed you to do anything much without using their proprietary software – usually a BASIC interpreter doubling up as the OS.</font>

<p>There were dozens of home computers back then. And apparently listings were not published for cost-reducing reasons for most of these. There certainly were lots of magazines at the time that published these listings and described how everything there worked.</p>

<p>It was certainly not something that you were supposed to use blindly.</p>

<p>I even remember one magazine which published sources of Turbo Pascal IDE!</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In any case it covered only 4 kibibytes of ROM but took up a considerable part of the book.</font>

<p>Yes, and <b>that</b> was cited as the reason not to publish everything later.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The first Macintosh came with 64 kibibytes of ROM and a listing of that would have been quite the hefty tome and probably not that useful to much of the target audience.</font>

<p>Yes, but the important part wasn't the size, but the shift from “we are not publishing these listings because they maybe changed <sub>but here are all out data structures if you need them</sub>” to “this is something which is available on the need-to-know bases <b>and you are not entitled to know</b>”.

<p>Shift was, definitely, gradual, not all-at-once, but with Mac arrival it concluded: not only nothing was published, but even attempts to look there and publish articles about these were meet with lawsuits.</p>

<p>That was quite radical change, at the time.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Note that the Apple II was marketed to people who were interested in computers, while the Macintosh was marketed to people who were interested in getting useful stuff done on computers without being interested in computers as such.</font>

<p>Sure, that was justification for that “jail made cool” stance.</p>

<p>It would take years before it would culminate at that <a href="https://www.gawker.com/5539717/steve-jobs-offers-world-freedom-from-porn">freedom from porn</a> stance, but seed were planted back then.</p>

That is now obsolete. It's now "freedom from pictures portraying people crossing the English Channel in a positive light", that well known terrible appalling universally repugnant thing. (Because these would be politically inconvenient to a particular cabinet minister.)<br>

Did they write it from scratch? It was widely alleged they didn't.<br>
<p>
Although, given the way "super programmers" go, I think we're often too quick to think "how did they do that?" But given the way source code was freely shared back then, it also wouldn't surprise me in the least if they got a copy of someone else's source and improved it ... and if it wasn't DEC's, it was certainly alleged they dumpster-dived it.<br>

<p>🧐 “Personal computer world before the internet”? Internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)#Transition_to_TCP/IP">was born in 1983</a>, thus we are talking about these early funny toy devices which nobody was taking seriously at the time?</p>

<p>Yes, sure, that's where proprietary software was born, more-or-less. Of course there would be issues.</p>

<p>But back then vast world of mainframe computers still existed and it wasn't something rare or obscure.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There was no compiler shipped with the system so C source would have been useless.</font>

<p>If you consider the fact that C wasn't a big thing back then and lots of people knew machine code by heart and just programmed in hex… it wasn't such a big problem.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Most of the software I actually ran would have needed a higher-end system to compile (link actually) successfully.</font>

<p>Yeah, Tim writes about that: <i>Microsoft took full advantage of the SCP system capability. In 1988, years after SCP had shut down, they were still using the SCP system for one task only it could perform ("linking the linker"). Their machine was equipped with the full 1 MB of RAM – 16 of the 64 KB cards. That machine could not be retired until 32-bit software tools were developed for Intel's 386 microprocessor.</i></p>

<p>And their infamous BASIC was initially created and run on the mainframe.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; On the PC world, there was the shareware phase (where binaries were free but you had to pay to get the source)
which was impractical outside the US due to international money transfer charge.</font>

<p>Outside of US there were no problems of international money transfer charges: people were just copying shareware and commercial programs <a href="http://www.os2museum.com/wp/wordset-stolen-without-compensation/">and even sold them</a> without doing any of these pesky transfers. Not sure how much of these things have survived, but here is <a href="http://old-dos.ru/files/file_3047.html">fork of Multi-Edit</a>, e.g.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There is a reason the GNU GPL has taken over the world.</font>

<p>That was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/505644/">before GPLv3 ruined things</a>, yes.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was time where people achieved at really good point WRT to sharing… and then we have learned that “perfect is the enemy of good” have more than one meaning.</p>

He's showing his (lack of) age.<br>
<p>
We're talking about the COMPUTING world, not the personal computing world. Oh, and by the way, "The Internet" may have been born in 1983, but the internet was born long before that. Heck, email is the same age as me give or take a few months, and that pre-dates The Internet by 20 years. Go back ANOTHER 20 years, and you have a whole bunch of computers being used in WWII.<br>
<p>
The first "modern" computer was designed and (partially) operational in the 18th century. The oldest known computer was built a couple of millenia before that! Isn't Ada Lovelace the Lady Byron widely recognised as "the first programmer"?<br>

I forgot to add, The Internet was born when the American DoD sold off the Arpanet. In other words, 1983 is more like when it "came of age", not when it was born.<br>

      <font class="QuotedText">&gt; Isn't Ada Lovelace the Lady Byron widely recognised as "the first programmer"?</font>

<p>Yes, but it's also widely recognised that physical construction of device which would have been used her programs was a bit delayed. As in: <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915-500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer/">there are still discussions about finishing it</a>, but no working devices so far.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;The first "modern" computer was designed and (partially) operational in the 18th century.</font>

<p>Not sure what “computer” you have in mind, but 1837th year is XIX century, not XVIII century.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Go back ANOTHER 20 years, and you have a whole bunch of computers being used in WWII.</font>

<p>Well, “the whole bunch” is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1940s_computers">maybe a dozen of devices</a>, right? There were lots of calculators involved in WWII, but most could only be “programmed” by physically changing wires and thus weren't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a>.</p>

<p>That phrase needs deciphering. For me “modern computer” == “Turing Complete”, if you use some other definition then it would be nice to know how you define it.</p>

A computer computes. Lovelace and Babbage realised the difference engine could be made turing complete, even if they didn't know what turing complete meant :-)<br>

It's like the first electronic computer. Was it Colossus (actually more electro-mechanical)? Eniac? Leo I think was late to the party, ... Basically, these things evolve, and where do you draw the line?<br>

Did the difference engine "do maths"? If so, even if the CPU had just a single hard-wired program, to me it's a modern calculating engine.<br>

      <font class="QuotedText">&gt; Lovelace and Babbage realised the difference engine could be made turing complete, even if they didn't know what turing complete meant :-)</font>

<p>Turing completeness is not something inique “Turing”. Dozen's (hundreds? thousands?) of researchers discovered and rediscovered it. The trick is to actually <b>make it</b>.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Basically, these things evolve, and where do you draw the line?</font>

<p>That's interesting question. But you have to draw a line somewhere, otherwise first computer would become created by Adam and Eve, somehow.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Did the difference engine "do maths"?</font>

<p>Yes, but that's not critical. The critical is the ability to do <b>any</b> math. It's similar to airplane. The first one flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozhaysky%27s_airplane">decades before Wright borthers</a>, but it lacked critical ability: it couldn't do turns, it can only fly a straight line.</p>

<p>That's why Wrights are considered the inventors of the first airplane: they solved the critical problem and invented a way to make airplane fly at arbitrary path, not just in straight line.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If so, even if the CPU had just a single hard-wired program, to me it's a modern calculating engine.</font>

<p>It's a calculation engine and can be used usefully (heck, IBM made commercial “calculating engine” in XIX century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company">before it was even named IBM</a>), but they are not “modern computers”.</p>

<p>The main question is: whether can we remove human from the equation (except for reading the final results). Tabulators have jams, they do miscalculations (there were ways to counter that, but humans had to do the work), etc.</p>

<p>Whether the Analytical Engine can work even in theory is unknown. But technologies of XIX century certainly weren't advanced enough to make it.</p>

<p>That's why Ada Lovelace is heralded as the “first programmer”, but  Charles Babbage is not the “first computer maker”.</p>

Yes you had your Apple II's, your Commodore 64s, but they weren't Personal Computers. The first was the IBM PC, running a 16-bit 8086. The previous generation all ran 8-bit CPU's, be they Z80, 8080, 6502, what have you.<br>

<p>What does that change? You can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc">accounting</a> with VisiCalc, you can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)">Word processing and draw diagrams</a> with geoWrite and geoPaint, what precisely can IBM PC (the original one) do significantly better?</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The first was the IBM PC, running a 16-bit 8086.</font>

<p>Nope. IBM PC wasn't first or even second attempt of IBM to enter new, lucrative, personal computer market. First was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5100">IBM 5100</a> (according to IBM, anyway, remember that IBM PC is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5150">IBM 5150</a>, IBM PC XT is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5160">IBM 5160</a>, and IBM PC AT is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5170">IBM 5170</a>), second was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/23_Datamaster"> IBM System/23 Datamaster</a>.</p>

<p>IBM PC was born by combining few existing technologies with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088">16-bit CPU in 8-bit package</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86-DOS">CP/M-compatible OS</a> + <a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-ibm-pc-41-years-ago/">Datamaster with CPU replaced</a>, more-or-less.</p>

<p>It immediately got WordStar and Visicalc, and while there were some PC-Unique programs later even things like <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-pascal/3x">Turbo Pascal 3.01A were produced for CP/M! Heck, the first “killer app” for an IBM PC wasn't even an entirely new type of app, but <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/lotus-1-2-3/1x">an improved version of already well-known and popular VisiCalc</a>!</a>

<p>In fact <b>IBM PC, together with clones</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120606052317/http://jeremyreimer.com/postman/node/329">sold less personal computers than Commodore with it's one C64 model in year 1984</a> and only in year 1986 it have become dominant!</p>

<p>And other 8-bit computers were introduced and sold long after IBM PC introduction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW">Amstrad PCW</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM_(computer)">ATM Turbo</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX">MSX with MSX-DOS from Microsoft</a>!

<p>It really feels like a rewriting of history by saying that IBM PC was the first PC.</p>

<p>Yes, eventually it have grown enough to supplant other personal computers (basically because Intel was the only one who managed to create a successful series of CPUs which went from 16bit all the way to 64bit), but that was very gradual process.</p>

<p>And yes, it's the only one which architecture survived till today, but pretty soon it would become impossible to run that venerable IBM PC 1.00 on modern devices (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#CSM_booting">CSM</a> is no longer mandatory), where would you put the “first personal computer” mark after that would happen?</p>

A few of my schoolmates had ZX80s or ZX81s (the Spectrum post-dates that). Later on I had a Jupiter Ace. They might have been personal computers, but they certainly weren't Personal Computers. If I remember correctly, they were micro-computers.<br>

<p>Yes, but Personal Computers weren't too special. In year 1984, when 8086-based devices have become an international standard they weren't even Personal Computers since IBM lost the crown! They were called “IBM Compatibles” and they weren't even something special.</p>

<p>Equation “Personal Computer” to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel">Wintel</a> took root after these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac">I'm a PC and I'm Mac</a> ads. Before that Macs (and other similar devices) were called PCs, too.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If I remember correctly, they were micro-computers.</font>

<p>I suspect it's regional. But if you look on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxZ_Z-_j71I&t=24s">that year 1977 Apple II ad</a>… <i>It's called Apple 2, the personal computer</i>.</p>

<p>That's years before IBM PC introduction. And if you want to say that IBM PC has “personal computer” in the name while Apple ][ doesn't… that's fair, but it took decades before Mac stopped being a “personal computer” and can be shown as an alternative to “personal computer”.</p>

The ZX81 was like 1979 to 1981. No one had personal computers back then. Anyone who had a computer had one of these micros.<br>
<p>
A little bit later, a very few had PCs, but they were initially quite expensive (£2k+?) and so they were business machines generally. It was rare for anyone to have one of those at home. If I knew of anyone with one, it was cause their dad was important at their work and their job had provided one for home use.<br>
<p>
In UK/Ireland, the Amstrad PCW was a bit more common at home. It was still a microcomputer dressed up a bit to look like a "business machine", but software wise a lot more like a micro. Late 80s PCs finally got a bit cheaper and got a little bit more common in home settings - but most people still had micros. Some very lucky sods had Atari STs or Amigas.<br>
<p>
Earlyish 90s is when I remember PCs gaining primacy at home. But I havn't checked historical market-shares of sales. ;)<br>

Sorry, but no. I distinctly remember reading a review of the ZX81 (and before that of the ZX80) in a glossy English magazine called Personal Computer World. IIRC all the Sinclair machine review issues had pictures of the device with a Chimpanzee on the front cover.<br>

Fair enough. By the time I was old enough to be aware of PCW, the term "Personal Computer" had shifted towards more business orientated machines, like the IBM PC and Amstrad PCW, and the PCW magazine's focus had shifted accordingly.<br>
<p>
Microcomputer were called that at the time too, so "micro" is maybe more descriptive of that class - where calling them "personal computers" is more confusing, given the shift in meaning.<br>
<p>
I was using "micro" v "personal" with that modern-tinted slant.<br>

      <blockquote><em>The first was the IBM PC, running a 16-bit 8086. The previous generation all ran 8-bit CPU's, be they Z80, 8080, 6502, what have you.</em></blockquote>
<p>
The original IBM PC used an 8088 processor, which was a scaled-down version of the 8086 with 16-bit registers and a 20-bit address bus but only an 8-bit data bus. The main advantages of the 8088 were that (a) it was fairly slow, about as fast as contemporary 8-bit processors, so IBM preferred it for the PC because there was less danger of the PC competing with bigger IBM products such as the AS/400, and (b) its instruction set was similar enough to the 8-bit Intel processors (the 8080 and 8085) that – while there was no direct binary compatibility – software written in assembly language for an 8080/85 could be made to run on the 8086/88 by re-assembling it. In practice this meant that companies could take their 8085-based code that ran on CP/M and get it to run on the IBM PC, whose PC-DOS (IBM's branded version of MS-DOS) basically started out as a rip-off of 8-bit CP/M, with fairly little effort. Finally, (c) the 8-bit-like architecture of the 8088 allowed IBM to recycle some designs – such as the expansion bus, which became the ISA bus on the PC – from the IBM System/23 Datamaster, an 8-bit computer that predated the IBM PC but had flopped in the market. (IBM had also stockpiled various 8-bit components for manufacturing the Datamaster, which it could conveniently dispose of by re-using them for the PC.)
</p>
<p>
At the time, the 8086/88 family of CPUs was widely regarded as something of a dud (certainly compared to Motorola's 68000, which had come out at approximately the same time) and not really going anywhere. If it hadn't been for the IBM PC, it probably wouldn't have had much of an impact. The 8088 in an original IBM PC wasn't <em>that</em> unlike, e.g., a Motorola 6809 as used in, say the TRS-80 Color Computer or the Dragon 32; the main difference being that the 6809 had only a 16-bit address bus, but then again early IBM PCs only came with 16 or 64 kilobytes of RAM, so the wider address bus of the 8088 wouldn't have made much of a difference in practice.
</p>
<p>
So, sure, if you insist that only IBM-PC-like systems can be considered “personal computers”, then the “personal computer era” starts in 1981 (when the first IBM PC, the 5150, came out). But when the IBM PC was new, apart from the “IBM” sticker on the case it really wasn't all that different from other systems on the market at the time. The Apple III, for example, supported more memory and a hard disk (which for the IBM PC only came along later), and while it was quite expensive and had its own set of issues which eventually made it unsuccessful as a product, it was arguably a more capable machine than the original IBM PC. The IBM PC's big psychological advantage was that, according to the old adage, “nobody was ever fired for buying IBM”, so its existence allowed corporate people to buy into this new-fangled idea of small computers because if respectable <em>IBM</em> was doing it (as opposed to weird new hippie-run companies named after fruit) there had to be something to the idea after all.

Define "surrounding". The problem here is the skills mismatch. "Surrounding" is irrelevant.<br>

I use WordPerfect (or would if I had real need of it, and could get it to work on todays' systems - I keep saying I'm going to buy an up-to-date copy, but it's not obviously available any more). And I don't have the time to try and get an older version working - every time I try it fails. I just want to USE the damn thing, not fight the computer over it. I have massive respect for the people who originally designed and wrote it - which is why I love it. Word (and its copies - sorry LO I include you there) are just a heap of crap thrown together.<br>
<p>
Likewise Pick. That was my professional life. It was designed to do its job very well, and it benefitted from about three re-writes by people who knew it well - as if a couple of people from Microsoft who knew SQL Server very well decided to write a new implementation from scratch - they knew all the problems, and solutions, and gotchas, and went for a new clean implementation of a well-worn design.<br>
<p>
But that means my skills are in database design, in query language (Pick is NoSQL, by the way), DataBASIC, and stuff like that. I have *some* C skills (no C++), so either starting from scratch or writing a new clone (of WP or Pick) is a major project. One massive advantage of Pick is it was originally a p-code complete operating system, so large chunks of it are written in itself! I'd love to see someone write a SQL engine using SQL and stored procedures and stuff like that - is it even possible?<br>
<p>
But that's the point. Unless you are talking about tools FOR computer professionals, the disconnect between the people who can write/maintain the tools, and the people who use said tools, is far too wide to really support much free sofware.<br>
<p>

WordPerfect is still available to purchase, the latest version is WordPerfect 2021, which you can buy from here – <a href="https://www.wordperfect.com/en/product/office-suite/">https://www.wordperfect.com/en/product/office-suite/</a> – only runs on Windows though, maybe you meant the Linux version or DOS version or whatever.<br>

If you want old versions, a lot of them can be found on abandonware websites. The DOS versions are pretty easy to run under emulators. I always wish the IBM mainframe version would turn up, that would be interesting.<br>

There is a partial open source clone of Pick, ScarletDME. It is actually a fork of the last GPL version of OpenQM, before it got closed-sourced again. Hasn't received a lot of attention–and is a quite different architecture from classic Pick. There are also "abandonware" copies of Pick R83 floating around, if you know where to look. Or you can download the "Personal Version" of OpenQM, which is proprietary/closed-source, but free for personal use subject to certain limits – the most onerous of which is 512KB maximum data per a hashed file.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; One massive advantage of Pick is it was originally a p-code complete operating system, so large chunks of it are written in itself!</span><br>
<p>
My impression is a lot of classic Pick (R83/etc) was written in Pick assembly rather than any high-level language – writing the p-code by hand, rather than generating it from a compiler, is a rather unusual approach, compared to classic p-code implementations (such as UCSD's or Microsoft's, or BCPL's Ocode). It does make sense when one considers Pick's "p-code", from what I understand, was originally the hardware ISA on the original Microdata hardware platforms. (Which were microcoded, so you might say the p-code was not the *real* hardware ISA – but if you say that, then x86 or IBM 360/370 aren't *real* hardware ISAs either.)<br>

<p>
If you hadn't noticed, I've made most of the recent contributions to ScarletDME. Mostly to the makefile to get it to build and install without leaving loads of extra work to get it running.<br>
<p>
Pick comes basically in two forms - the original p-code operating system from the 60s, and the DevCOM "Pick as a program" rewrite from the 70s. Pick was also the very first commercial database on linux - Oracle like to think that title belongs to them but Pick beat them to it by about 6 months. About that time, Original Pick was rewritten as "Pick as a Program".<br>
<p>
Most of the DevCom legacy is all written in DataBASIC rather than asssembly, but the user-space has merged so much pretty any Pick program will run on any Pick system with minimal tweaks.<br>
<p>
As for OpenQM's history, DevCOM sold rights to Pr1me - Pr1me INFORMATION was hugely successful until the hardware business brought it down. A software house cloned INFORMATION as UniVerse, then bought INFORMATION off the shell of Pr1me. About this time, Martin Philips left Pr1me and wrote QM (which became OpenQM and ScarletDME)<br>
<p>
And then UniVerse and UniData (another clone) had their owners merge to make Ardent, which was bought by Informix. The U2 product side then staged an "inside takeover" and Informix the database disappeared. IBM bought Informix in order to get the software rights to build DataStage, their data warehouse. The DB2 division couldn't wait to get rid of it, because the U2 products were growing so fast they on course to dislodge DB2 as the crown of the DB2 division ... and now it's all owned by Rocket.<br>

Well said. But I think the pendulum will swing back at one point - maybe not on a wide scale, but once a person is locked out of their "main" account (e.g. Google, Apple, etc.) they'll quickly learn the value of local storage &amp; backups. Post-facto, yes, but still…<br>

Not with the present technology. Spin-up time adds latency, rotation adds latency, the at-home disc-writing process is chemical (also somewhat latent), and we would need an optical drive with much more parallelism (18 lasers reading/4 lasers writing tracks concurrently) to get close to speeds of consumer-level NVMe flash storage (1300MB/s r, ~200MB/s w).<br>

What does NVMe have to do with optical drives? Optical drives in the modern world are going to be for backup purposes or file sharing purposes; they're up against flash drives in the physical world and Google Drive and friends in the cloud world. Bluray burners can do 1GB per minute, which beats 100 Mbps Internet, a more relevant comparison.<br>

That's odd ... I've just retrieved a backup CD from that era or earlier (I wanted to get something off of it), and it read fine ...<br>

A lot of it depends on the quality of the CD. Cheap stuff was crap, and it didn't last. But the good stuff lasts fine.<br>

<p>Nah, it's not that. They don't have crippled error-correction, but mostly just cheap optics. Data CDs have two levels of error correction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-interleaved_Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_coding">CIRC</a> at the very low level and another one on per-sector level. Audio CDs are using 2352 bytes sectors and don't have that second part.</p>

      <blockquote><em>JFS came out of IBM and was the main filesystem for the AIX operating system; it, too, supported journaling.</em></blockquote>
<p>
IIRC the JFS in the Linux kernel is not based on the one from AIX, but on IBM's reimplementation of JFS for OS/2.
</p>
<p>
This fact gained some notoriety during the SCO Group vs. IBM trial, where The SCO Group alleged that IBM had improperly appropriated the AIX version of JFS to put into Linux, and therefore owed the SCO Group $$$ in damages. 
This was based on the theory that The SCO Group, previously called Caldera Inc., had bought various Unix-related copyrights, including that to Unix SVR4, from the Santa Cruz Operation (a different company called SCO for short), which had bought them from Novell, which had bought them from AT&amp;T. According to The SCO Group, anything built on SVR4, like AIX, was a derived work of SVR4, and hence its source code had to be kept confidential like the original (rather than released under the GPL as part of Linux). IBM then showed that the JFS code in Linux was based on the OS/2 code base and hence had nothing to do with SVR4.

It may be worth pointing out that linux-next also contains my series to remove 80% of the legacy board files in arch/arm/. The total size of the removed code is about as much as arch/ia64/ and arch/sh/ combined, but it also seems way less controversial as this just removes the bits that were marked as unused last year and had nobody object to that classification.<br>

As a user of a rather dated Kirkwood device, the Excito B3, with only a tiny gathering of happy users, I wonder if I need to worry about that.<br>
<p>
I took a dive in linux-next and I still see the device tree for the B3 there. Does that mean that support for my device isn't on the chopping block quite yet?<br>
<p>
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-b3.dts">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linu...</a><br>
<p>
Arnd, I believe I found your notice about this below, and I don't see any mention of Kirkwood or the B3 there, so I hope it's alive for now at least.<br>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAK8P3a0Z9vGEQbVRBo84bSyPFM-LF+hs5w8ZA51g2Z+NsdtDQA@mail.gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAK8P3a0Z9vGEQbVRBo84bSyPFM-L...</a><br>
<p>
In general, do I need to keep an eye on that file in linux-next going forward? If so, what would be a good way to do that?<br>
<p>
As a comment to the wider discussion on this topic: As a user I'm well aware that I absolutely cannot, nor do I expect to be able to, demand support for my legacy device or anything else which is provided by FLOSS communities. That's obvious as long as I do not contribute in any substantial way to that end.<br>
<p>
That said, I believe I'm allowed to ask kindly for continued support or at least pipe up and let it be known that I still use such a device. Though, we users of course need to be mindful to not express such a wish as an obligation or demand.<br>

The machines that got removed include only legacy boardfiles that were never converted to devicetree, there are currently no plans for any mass removal of device tree files or their driver support. Kirkwood is fairly well supported anyway as ARMv5 platforms go, it clearly isn't going anywhere as long as distros support it. Debian still fully supports ARMv5, and OpenWRT even has some supported ARMv4 targets, though some other ones have phased out v4 and v5 support over the years. If this trend continues, <br>
<p>
There are a couple of platforms that include DT support that may get removed in the future: s3c24xx included partial DT support that is now gone as well, while oxnas and axxia are examples of platforms that are only partially upstream and neither functional nor actively being worked on. These may get removed in the future, leaving  their users with a slightly larger patch set to maintain out of tree than they already have.<br>
<p>
For the non-DT boardfiles, the approach this time was rather liberal, we are keeping anything that anyone said they would like to keep for basically any reason. I expect that we will get back to the remaining 39 machines and keep getting stricter here over time, e.g. requiring users to either plan to move on to other hardware or help out converting the machines to devicetree. For about half of them I know there are already plans to do one or the other.<br>

<p>
I'm unsure how long this is going to last: Debian's ARMv5 architecture (armel) has reached a point where it's one of the more frequently troublesome ones. As well as the usual slow-hardware and limited-address-space problems that affect multiple architectures, it's our only release architecture (what other communities would call a tier 1 architecture) that doesn't have lock-free atomic operations, and increasingly many of the upstream projects we rely on assume that by now lock-free atomics are available everywhere.<br>
<p>
My guess would be that this year's Debian 12 release will probably include armel, but Debian 13 probably won't.<br>

Yes, I'm aware of that. If Debian 13 (or 14, or 20) drops support for CPUs older than ARMv7, then users of Raspberry Pi v1 will not be able to use the latest Debian, and instead will have to use the 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) or an older Debian release. If developers who place a high value on Raspberry Pi v1 want to ensure that isn't necessary, then they're welcome to do the work to keep ARMv5 (or at least ARMv6) at release-architecture status, and I'm not trying to prevent anyone from doing that. At the moment, I see from the release team's architecture information that there have been 2 volunteers to look after armel in Debian 12.<br>
<p>
One aspect of that work that is unique to armel and does not apply to any other release architecture (and therefore is unlikely to be solved as a side-effect by people whose goal is to port to some other architecture) is providing patches where necessary to make important packages not need to assume that lock-free atomics exist. Sometimes this is as simple as scattering some extra -latomic through the build system, or sometimes it's more involved.<br>

I am using Kirkwood on my primary NAS (Pogoplug v4) at home so as long as I have something to say about it that isn't going away.<br>
<p>
Userspace is the biggest problem since I was using ArchLinuxARM (alarm) on this device and they just silently dropped the entire binary repository at some point the last 6 months or so.<br>
<p>
My plan is to simply phase over to OpenWrt as use KSMBD with it and be happy. What is your usecase for the Kirkwood?<br>

I wonder if it would make sense to have a "tier" system, with mainstream architectures being "tier 1" and niche/hobbyist architectures as "tier 2". The idea would be, you can have your code in-tree, that doesn't cost much, but people doing treewide changes are not in any way obligated to keep those architectures building. They can, if it's easy, but patches can be merged without doing so.<br>
<p>
That would eliminate much of the maintenance burden, while still giving those niche/hobbyist architectures some of the benefits of being in-tree. The main change would be to declare that those architectures don't get substantial free maintenance effort from other kernel developers.<br>

This seems a bit strange considering that USB devices can't do DMA and network traffic stealing issues are the same as for devices using CDC Ethernet or other USB network protocols instead - one should use <code>usbguard</code> to protect against these threats.<br>

A possible justification for such removal would be (theoretical) <code>rndis_host</code> driver code quality issues or its lack of maintenance, however that's an issue with the implementation, rather than with the protocol itself.<br>

I had to add the RNDIS host module to our image only weeks ago because we might get a "new" modem. Well, it's not a brand new product, but our hardware vendor introduces it as a cost saving measure I understood. (I saw some other warning signs for the quality, too, so I don't claim it's necessarily a very good product.)<br>

In another life about 15 years ago, I was involved with a project that wanted to use databases hosted on JFS filesystems (I forget why).  Linux JFS had some fairly serious performance issues with multiple writing / allocating threads, so I made some fairly simple if hacky changes that produced significant improvement.  Unfortunately, we started seeing very occasional file corruption problems as well, and it was never clear whether the problem was hardware or software.  The project was terminated before we figured out the answer.<br>
<p>
I never submitted those patches.  A few times over the years, I've stumbled over the files and thought "maybe I should give them another try", but real life always intervened.  I guess I can delete them now.<br>

Huh, why? If the hardware still exists and is working, it mustn’t be removed, just converted to DTB.<br>

that's why it's on the chopping block, no one is stepping up to maintain. <br>
I'm all for wide compatibility but when code goes unmaintained it's a security risk. <br>

I feel that deprecations should be followed through at (or near) the announced time/release if there are no objections at the time. That way people take them seriously and actually feel the need to announce that they are still using the code when they happen instead of just assuming that they will never happen anyway.<br>

Put deprecated code behind a build option defaulting to false.<br>
<p>
<p>
Get people who build kernels to generate a log listing all "deprecated = true" flags. Maybe make "make" do it by default.<br>
<p>
And ask them to send it to deprecated at linux.<br>

Cheers,<br>

<p>
Note the assumption that people who are still using the code will see the deprecation notice.  I use lots of programs without following the developers' discussions.  I don't have time to do so, and for the most part, I'm not interested.  I'm a *user*.  I mainly write documents describing technical issues so that higher ups can make informed decisions.  I follow the technology that I write about very closely, but I use a lot of technology that I don't follow.  I have to, as nearly everything is high tech now.  I'm sure there's lots of discussion about the code that runs my car.  I don't want to follow the discussion.  I just want my car to take me where I'm going.<br>
<p>
This is why it was stated earlier that a lot of open source code is "by programmers, for programmers".  There is no consideration of the technically naïve people who have jobs to do.<br>

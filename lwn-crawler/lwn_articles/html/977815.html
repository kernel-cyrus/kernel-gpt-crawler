The BPF verifier is a complex program. This has the unfortunate effect of making
it simultaneously more difficult for contributors to work on, and more likely
to harbor unknown bugs. Shung-Hsi Yu had two concrete proposals for how to
simplify the verifier to make it easier to maintain that he presented at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>. Yu proposed changing how the
verifier tracks partially known values and cleaning up the interface to
hide the details of the value-tracker's internal representation.
</p>

</a>

<p>
One of the core functions of the verifier is value tracking â€” inferring the set
of possible values that a variable can hold, in order to ensure that accesses
remain within bounds. Since any value could potentially be used to compute an
array index or other quantity the verifier is interested in knowing, the value
tracker needs to follow every value in the program.
The verifier stores information on possible values in the
<tt>bpf_reg_state</tt> structure, which tracks two related kinds of information.
The first is "known bits", which uses a mask to indicate when individual bits of
the value are known exactly:
</p>

<pre>
    struct tnum {
        u64 value;
        u64 mask;
    }
</pre>

<p>
The second is the valid range of the value, tracked
as both signed and unsigned 32- and 64-bit quantities:
</p>

<pre>
    struct bpf_reg_state {
        ...
        struct tnum var_off;
        s64 smin_value; /* minimum possible (s64)value */
        s64 smax_value; /* maximum possible (s64)value */
        u64 umin_value; /* minimum possible (u64)value */
        u64 umax_value; /* maximum possible (u64)value */
        s32 s32_min_value; /* minimum possible (s32)value */
        s32 s32_max_value; /* maximum possible (s32)value */
        u32 u32_min_value; /* minimum possible (u32)value */
        u32 u32_max_value; /* maximum possible (u32)value */
    }
</pre>

<p>
This choice of what information to track represents a tradeoff between accuracy
and efficiency. If computers had overabundant memory,
the verifier could just track the set of possible
values directly using a generic set data structure. The downside of that approach
would be the significantly increased memory overhead compared to the bytes required
to store a <tt>bpf_reg_state</tt>.
The downside of the more efficient approach is that it can't represent all
possible sets of values, so sometimes the code needs to make a conservative
over-approximation, which can snowball and make the verifier fail to figure out
bounds that it theoretically could have. For example, the verifier can't
currently handle a disjoint range, like a value that must be between one and
four <em>or</em> eight and ten. Instead, it would track the range as just one to
ten.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
In practice, tracking both known bits and
possible ranges provides a good tradeoff. Either one alone would fail to capture
important properties that the verifier cares about, but together they aren't too
large or complex to work with. They can represent possible sets of
values such as "a multiple of eight between zero and 64", which is a good fit
for tracking the alignment and bounds of an array access.
</p>

<h4>Track fewer bounds</h4>

<p>
Yu has a proposal that could simplify the actual implementation of
<tt>bpf_reg_state</tt> significantly, while still keeping the same precision:
stop tracking the signed versions of the ranges separately. Right now, whenever the
verifier updates one range (such as inferring a new <tt>smin_value</tt> from a
conditional branch),
it needs to perform a complex synchronization to make sure the
change is reflected in every range. Right now, that synchronization involves
propagating information in 20 different directions, Yu said. This is necessary
because the code doesn't track which fields have been updated, so synchronizing
the bounds after processing a chunk of code involve sharing information from
each of the five tracked constraints (four ranges and a <tt>tnum</tt>), to each of the
other four.
</p>

<p>
Instead of tracking ranges in the current way, Yu proposes tracking
ranges using a variant of the approach he
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZTZxoDJJbX9mrQ9w@u94a/">discussed</a> in October
2023. Essentially, the maximum would be allowed to be lower than the minimum.
The range represented this way always starts at the minimum and ends at the
maximum, but it might wrap around part way through. This means that the range
(minimum: 0xFFFFFFFC, maximum: 4) represents the signed range (-4, 4) while
simultaneously representing the <em>unsigned</em> ranges (0xFFFFFFFC,
UINT32_MAX) and (0, 4). The existing code doesn't handle disjoint ranges like
that, so Yu plans to add some conversion functions that convert from the new
representation for use by the old code.
</p>

<p>
Storing ranges this way has a few benefits. The biggest one is that there is no
need to synchronize knowledge of signed and unsigned bounds â€” they are
automatically synchronized, simply by virtue of the representation. That also cuts
down on the amount of information the verifier needs to propagate between the
known-bits representation and the range representations, bringing the code down
to only six directions of information flow (from each of the three bounds to
the two others). Yu hopes that this will make the
verifier code that handles value tracking much easier to work with, and also to
formally verify.
</p>

<p>
Yu plans to get the changes into upstream in a few steps; initially, there will
be conversion functions and the main verifier code will remain largely
unchanged. Then, he plans to change the most critical parts of the
value-tracking code to use the new representation natively, followed by adapting
the kernel selftests. Finally, the last uses can be removed along with the
conversion functions.
</p>

<p>
Yu's second proposal for simplifying the value tracker is to introduce a more
abstract interface for working with <tt>tnum</tt> and range values. The
proposals can be implemented independently, but they would certainly complement
one another. Right now, working on the verifier code requires knowledge of the
internal details of <tt>tnum</tt>s and ranges; but the most common operations to
perform on these values are just intersections and inclusion checks, Yu said. If
those were pulled out into their own functions, a lot of the actual
value-tracking code could be substantially simplified.
</p>

<p>
Those aren't the only possible ways to ease maintenance of the verifier,
however. The session ended with a discussion of how to improve the
documentation, what aspects of the verifier could potentially be standardized,
and how these proposals would impact formal verification. The verifier has
certainly earned its reputation as a tricky piece of code to maintain, but it
seems like the kernel's BPF developers have a plan to start changing that.

It might make verification faster and more tractable if BPF allowed you to declare an integer type which cannot be cast to a pointer.  Though I don't know how that could be done at the bytecode level.

Could you declare it as only holding a restricted range of values? So if you're going to use it as an array index, you say "int ii (0-10)" for example.<br>
<p>
Then when BPF validates it, it knows that accessing an array with mismatching bounds (lower &gt;0 or upper &lt; 10) is a violation, and assigning a value outside those limits is a violation. Okay, arrays then need to be bounded at compile time, but (speaking as an ex-Fortran programmer :-) that shouldn't be too hard ...<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 29, 2010</br>
           </div>
The SLUB allocator first <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/229984/">made its
appearance</a> in April, 2007.  It went into the mainline shortly
thereafter.  This allocator was intended to provide better performance
while being much more memory efficient than the existing slab allocator.
One of the key mechanisms for improving memory use was to get rid of the
extensive object queues maintained by slab; with enough processors, those
queues can grow to the point that they occupy a significant percentage of
total memory even when there is nothing in them.  SLUB works well in many
workloads, but it has been plagued by regressions on certain benchmarks.
So SLUB has never achieved its goal of displacing slab altogether, and
developers have talked occasionally about getting rid of it.
<p>
But SLUB does better than slab on other benchmarks, and its code  is widely
held to be more readable than slab - though <i>that</i> is widely held to
be faint praise.  So, over the years, attempts have been made to improve
the SLUB allocator's performance.  The latest such attempt is <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/394048/">SLUB+Queuing</a> which, according to
its developer Christoph Lameter, beats slab on the all-important
"hackbench" benchmark.
<p>
There are a couple of significant changes in the SLUB+Q patch set which are
intended to improve the performance of SLUB.  At the top of the
list is the restoration of queues to the allocator.  SLUB+Q does not use the
elaborate queues found in slab, though; there is, instead, a single per-CPU
queue containing pointers to free objects belonging to the cache.
Allocation operations are now simple, at least when the queue is not empty:
the last object in the queue is handed out, and the length of the queue is
decreased by one.  Freeing into a non-empty queue is similar.  So the fast
path, in both cases, should be fast indeed.
<p>
If a given CPU's queue goes empty, the SLUB+Q allocator must fall back to
allocating objects out of pages, perhaps allocating more pages in the
process.  That, of course, is quite a bit slower.  In an attempt to
minimize the cost of this slow path, SLUB+Q will go ahead and pre-fill the
queue, up to the "batch size" (half of the queue's total length, by
default) with free objects.  So, in a 
situation where many more objects are being allocated than freed, the fast
allocation path will continue to be used most of the time.
<p>
If the queue overflows, instead, the allocator must push objects back into
the pages they came from.  Once again, the behavior chosen is to prune the
queue back to a half-full state; the allocator will not push back all
objects in the queue unless the kernel has indicated that it is under
serious memory pressure.  The default size of the queue is dependent on the
object size, but it (along with the batch size) can be changed via a sysfs
parameter. 
<p>

alt="[SLUB free list]" border=0 align="right" hspace=3>

The other significant change has to do with how free objects are handled
when they are not stored in one of the per-CPU queues.  In current mainline
kernels, SLUB maintains a list of pages which contain some free objects.
Note that it does not keep pages which are fully allocated (those can be
simply forgotten about until at least one object contained therein is
freed); it also does not keep pages which are fully free (those are handed
back to the page allocator).  The partial pages contain one or more free
objects which are organized into a linked list, as is vaguely shown in the
diagram to the right.  There is a certain aesthetic value to doing things
this way; it uses the free memory itself to keep track of free objects,
minimizing the amount of overhead needed for object management.
<p>
Unfortunately, there is also a cost to storing list pointers in the freed
objects.  Chances are good that, by the time the kernel gets around to
freeing an object, it will not have been used for a bit; it may well be
cache-cold on the freeing CPU.  Objects which are on the free list are even
more likely to be cache-cold.  Putting list pointers into that object will
bring it into the CPU cache, incurring a cache miss and, possibly,
displacing something which was more useful.  The result is a measurable
performance hit.
<p>
Thus, over time, it has become clear
that memory management is more efficient if it can avoid touching the
objects which are being managed.
The SLUB+Q patches achieve this goal by using a bitmap to track which objects in
a given page are free.  If the number of objects which can fit into a page
is small enough, this bitmap can be stored in the <tt>page</tt> structure
in the system memory map; otherwise it is placed at the end of the page
itself.  Now the management of free objects just requires tweaking bits in
this (small) bitmap; the objects themselves are not changed by the allocator.
<p>
The hackbench benchmark works by creating groups of processes, then quickly
passing messages between them using sockets.  SLUB has tended to perform
worse on this benchmark than slab, sometimes significantly so.  With the
new patches, Christoph has posted benchmark results showing performance
which is significantly better than what slab achieves.  If these results
hold, SLUB+Q will have overcome one of the primary problems seen by SLUB.
<p>
It should be noted, though, that performance on a single benchmark is not
especially indicative of the performance of a memory allocator in general;
SLUB already beat slab on a number of other tests.  Memory management
performance is a subtle and tricky area to work in.  So a lot more testing
will be required before it will be possible to say that SLUB+Q has truly
addressed SLUB's difficulties without introducing regressions of its own.

While the best way to avoid performance problems associated with page
faults is usually to avoid faulting altogether, that is not always an
option.  Thus, it is important that the kernel handle page faults with a
minimum of overhead.  One particular pain point in current kernels comes
about in multi-threaded workloads that are all incurring faults in the
same address space.  Speculative page-fault handling is an old idea for
improving the scalability of such workloads that may finally be approaching
a point where it can be considered for inclusion.
<p>

Memory-management performance with multi-threaded workloads is often
bounded by the ability to acquire the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> reader/writer
semaphore, which serializes access to the data structures describing a
process's address space.  The handling of page faults, in particular,
requires <tt>mmap_sem</tt>, so a process with a large number of threads
generating faults will see contention. Speculative page faults are an
attempt to alleviate this contention by doing lockless reads of a process's
virtual memory areas (VMA) without holding <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.
<p>

The speculative page-fault patches <a href="/Articles/369511/">first
appeared in 2009</a> and have been discussed
and improved upon intermittently by various kernel developers through the
years, but this work has not found its way into the kernel. Laurent Dufour
has recently <a href="/Articles/730160/">revived this
effort</a> by resubmitting the patches with fixes and
improvements of his own, and an active discussion took place on the 
linux-kernel mailing list on its inclusion. Notably, Dufour reports a 20% speed
improvement loading a 2TB database with the speculative page fault
code.</p>

<p>As noted above, the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore can be a point of
significant contention for multi-threaded workloads.
In particular, page-fault handling requires access to a process's VMA
structures that describe its memory layout, and that
access requires <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  Even when only read locking is required
(as is the case for page faults), frequent access to <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
leads to cache-line bouncing and poor performance.

The idea behind speculative page faults is to increase memory-management
performance by avoiding the use of the
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> in page-fault handling.  Doing so requires a
way to perform a lockless walk of the VMAs; that, in turn, means facing a
number of problems that <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is explicitly there to prevent.
<p>
The first of these problems, naturally, is that the VMA describing the area
where a fault occurs may, if <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is not held, change during
the handling of the fault.  The strategy taken to address this problem is
to do as much work as possible that doesn't depend on the state of the VMA,
then checking to see if anything has changed before changing the process's
address space directly.  So, for example, a free page can be allocated and
its data read in from disk independently of the address space, but actually
putting that page into the address space requires a consistent view of the
VMA.
<p>
The kernel has a longstanding mechanism for this kind of access: the <a
href="/Articles/22818/">seqlock</a>.  So the patch set adds a seqlock to
the VMA structure, along with the code to increment its sequence count
everywhere that the VMA is changed.  The speculative fault-handling code
can then record the sequence number before doing any work and verify that
the number has not changed at the end.  If the sequence number <i>does</i>
change, 
the VMA has been changed and the speculative work was done in vain; in this
case the attempt fails and the fault is retried in the old-fashioned way.

<p>The second problem is a bit trickier; without <tt>mmap_sem</tt>, a VMA
may disappear entirely while a fault is being handled.  This situation is
avoided by using read-copy-update (RCU) to keep VMA structures around while
a fault is being handled. SRCU (the sleepable variant of RCU) is used to
serialize VMA updates and accommodate lockless reads of the VMA. SRCU is
required because a number of fault-handling operations can sleep.

<p>When handling a page fault speculatively, the kernel will do a lockless
page-table walk and grab the finer-grained page-table lock. Then it does a
<tt>srcu_read_lock()</tt> to do a VMA lookup, and checks the write-sequence
count of the VMA.  It will need to use the VMA to find the page that the
address faulted on, but to do this it needs to drop the page table lock to
honor locking order rules. Once the page is found, the VMA is validated
again by repeating the page table walk, obtaining the page-table lock,
and validating that the VMA sequence number did not change. If it didn't,
the page is installed in the page table, and the page-table lock is
released. 

<p>
Another pitfall with speculative page-fault handling has to do with
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) invalidation.  Various actions, such as
unmapping a memory area, can call for a TLB invalidation; that is handled
by sending inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) to tell each CPU to invalidate its
own TLB.  The unmap path can lock specific page-table entries and
perform the invalidation while that lock is held.  The speculative
fault-handling path, meanwhile, will attempt to take the page-table lock
it needs with interrupts disabled.  Should that attempt happen on a
page-table entry that is held by the unmap path, the processor will spin in
a loop with interrupts disabled, meaning it will never receive the
TLB-invalidation IPI.  The result is a deadlock, a situation that is even
worse for performance than <tt>mmap_sem</tt> contention.  Once this problem
is understood the solution is straightforward: use a "trylock" operation to
acquire the lock in the speculative path, and fall back to traditional
fault handling if it fails.

<p>The first speculative page fault patches were <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=125809791306459&w=2">posted in
2009</a> by Hiroyuki Kamezawa.  The ensuing discussion led Peter Zijlstra
to create his own implementation based on the idea of using RCU to enable
lockless reading of the VMA structures. Zijlstra's implementation had some
issues of its own; no code was merged, and the discussion stalled and
fizzled out. The idea was <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=141384498726773&w=2">revived again
by Zijlstra</a> in 2014, because many of the issues blocking the progress
of previous attempts had been solved.  However, the discussion fizzled out
again, and there was no push for merging the code.

In June, Dufour forward-ported Zijlstra's patches and added some of his
own. One of the problems
Dufour addresses with his patches is the <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149330863917282&w=2">TLB
invalidation issue</a>.

<p>Despite the two previous abandoned speculative page fault
implementations, the idea is useful enough for another attempt to be made
at trying to get this code merged into the kernel. Dufour's database-loading
speed improvements led Michal Hocko <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149702059609971&w=2">to ask</a> if
there were any other tests or benchmarks that were run, such as kernbench
or other highly threaded workloads.  In response, the August&nbsp;8 posting
(linked above) includes a number of results from different benchmarks,
showing modest to significant improvements depending on the test.
<p>
At this point, it would appear that the significant issues with this patch
set have been addressed.  Given that speculative page-fault handling shows
significant improvements for some workloads, one might not be faulted for
speculating that there is a reasonable chance
that this work will be merged in the relatively near future — a mere
eight years after the initial idea was floated.</p>

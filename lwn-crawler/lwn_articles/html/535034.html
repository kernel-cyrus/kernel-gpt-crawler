           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 30, 2013</br>
           </div>
The kernel's block loop driver has a conceptually simple job: take a file
located in a filesystem somewhere and present it as a block device that can
contain a filesystem of its own.  It can be used to manipulate filesystem
images; it is also useful for the management of filesystems for virtualized
guests.  Despite having had some optimization effort applied to it, the
loop driver in current kernels is not as fast as some would like it to be.
But that situation may be about to change, thanks to an old patch set that
has been revived and prepared for merging in a near-future development
cycle.
<p>
As a block driver, the loop driver accepts I/O requests described by
<tt>struct bio</tt> (or "BIO")
structures; it then maps each request to a suitable block offset in the
file serving as backing store and issues I/O requests to perform the
desired operations on that file.  Each loop device has its own thread,
which, at its core, runs a loop like this:
<p>
<pre>
    while (1) {
	wait_for_work();
	bio = dequeue_a_request()
	execute_request(bio);
    }
</pre>
<p>
(The actual code can be seen in <tt>drivers/block/loop.c</tt>.)  This code
certainly works, but it has an important shortcoming: it performs I/O in a
synchronous, single-threaded manner.  Block I/O is normally done
asynchronously when possible; write operations, in particular, can be done
in parallel with other work.  In the loop above, though, a single, slow
read operation can hold up many other requests, and there is no
ability for the block layer or the I/O device itself to optimize the
ordering of requests.  As a result, the performance of loop I/O traffic is
not what it could be.
<p>
In 2009, Zach Brown set out to fix this problem by changing the loop driver
to execute multiple, asynchronous requests at the same time.  That
work fell by the wayside when other priorities took over Zach's time, so
his patches were never merged.  More recently, Dave Kleikamp has
taken over this patch set, ported it to current kernels, and added support to
more filesystems.  As a result, this patch set may be getting close to
being ready to go into the mainline.
<p>
At the highest level, the goal of this patch set is to use the kernel's
existing asynchronous I/O (AIO) mechanism in the loop driver.  Getting
there takes a surprising amount of work, though; the AIO subsystem was
written to manage user-space requests and is not an easy fit for
kernel-generated operations.  To make these subsystems work together, the
<a href="/Articles/534928/">30-part patch set</a> takes a bottom-up
approach to the problem.
<p>
The AIO code is based around a couple of structures, one of which is
<tt>struct iovec</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    struct iovec {
	void __user *iov_base;
	__kernel_size_t iov_len;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure is used by user-space programs to describe a segment of an
I/O operation; it is part of the user-space API and cannot be changed.
Associated with this structure is the internal <tt>iov_iter</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct iov_iter {
	const struct iovec *iov;
	unsigned long nr_segs;
	size_t iov_offset;
	size_t count;
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure (defined in <tt>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</tt>) is used by the
kernel to track progress working through an 
array of <tt>iovec</tt> structures.  
<p>
Any kernel code needing to submit asynchronous I/O needs to express it in
terms of these structures.  The problem, from the perspective of the loop
driver, is that <tt>struct iovec</tt> deals with user-space addresses.  But
the BIO structures representing block I/O operations deal with physical
addresses in the form of <tt>struct page</tt> pointers.  So there is an
impedance mismatch between the two subsystems that makes AIO unusable for
the loop driver.
<p>
Fixing that involves changing the way <tt>struct iov_iter</tt> works.  The
<tt>iov</tt> pointer becomes a generic pointer called <tt>data</tt> that
can point to an array of <tt>iovec</tt> structures (as before) or, instead,
an array of kernel-supplied BIO structures.  Direct access to structure
members by kernel code is discouraged in favor of a set of defined
accessor operations; the <tt>iov_iter</tt> structure itself gains a pointer
to an operations structure 
that can be changed depending on whether <tt>iovec</tt> or <tt>bio</tt>
structures are in use.  The
end result is an enhanced <tt>iov_iter</tt> structure and surrounding
support code that allows AIO operations to be expressed in either
user-space (<tt>struct iovec</tt>) or kernel-space (<tt>struct bio</tt>)
terms.  Quite a bit of code using this structure must be adapted to use the
new accessor functions; at the higher levels, code that worked directly
with <tt>iovec</tt> structures is changed to work with the
<tt>iov_iter</tt> interface instead.
<p>
The next step is to make it possible to pass <tt>iov_iter</tt> structures
directly into filesystem code.  That is done by adding two more functions
to the (already large) <tt>file_operations</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*read_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *, loff_t);
    ssize_t (*write_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *, loff_t);
</pre>
<p>
These functions are meant to work much like the existing
<tt>aio_read()</tt> and <tt>aio_write()</tt> functions, except that they
work with <tt>iov_iter</tt> structures rather than with <tt>iovec</tt>
structures directly.  A filesystem supporting the new operations must be
able to cope with I/O requests expressed directly in BIO structures â€”
usually just a matter of bypassing the page-locking and mapping operations
required for user-space addresses.  If these new operations are provided,
the <tt>aio_*()</tt> functions will never be called and can be removed.
<p>
After that, the patch set adds a new interface to make it easy for kernel
code to submit asynchronous I/O operations.  In short, it's a matter of
allocating an I/O control block with:
<p>
<pre>
    struct kiocb *aio_kernel_alloc(gfp_t gfp);
</pre>
<p>
That block is filled in with the relevant information describing the
desired operation and a pointer to a completion callback, then handed off
to the AIO subsystem with: 
<p>
<pre>
    int aio_kernel_submit(struct kiocb *iocb);
</pre>
<p>
Once the operation is complete, the completion function  is called to
inform the submitter of the final status. 
<p>
A substantial portion of the patch set is dedicated to converting
filesystems to provide <tt>read_iter()</tt> and <tt>write_iter()</tt>
functions.  In 
most cases the patches are relatively small; most of the real work is done
in generic code, so it is mostly a matter of changing declared types and
making use of some of the new <tt>iov_iter</tt> accessor functions.  See <a
href="/Articles/535178/">the ext4 patch</a> for an example of what needs to
be done.
<p>
With all that infrastructural work done, actually speeding up the loop
driver becomes straightforward.  If the backing store for a given loop
device implements the new operations, the loop driver will use
<tt>aio_kernel_submit()</tt> for each incoming I/O request.  As a result,
requests can be run in parallel with, one hopes, a significant improvement
in performance.
<p>
The patch set has been through several rounds of review, and most of the
concerns raised would appear to have been addressed.  Dave is now asking
that it be included in the linux-next tree, suggesting that he intends to
push it into the mainline during the 3.9 or 3.10 development cycle.  Quite
a bit of kernel code will be changed in the process, but almost no
differences should be visible from user space â€” except that block loop
devices will run a lot faster than they used to.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Wouldn't it be better to just have the new functions (<tt>read_iter</tt> and <tt>write_iter</tt>) <em>always</em> take <tt>struct bio</tt>-based structures, and convert the <tt>struct iovec</tt>s to these structures in the generic <tt>aio_*</tt> functions?

This would result in a far cleaner abstraction, IMO&hellip;

IIRC the kernel AIO interface requires files to be opened with O_DIRECT, as well as page (or block?)-aligned I/O. So it's not really a general-purpose interface.<br>

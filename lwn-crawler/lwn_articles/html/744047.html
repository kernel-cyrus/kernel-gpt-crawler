           <p>January 15, 2018</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by <a href="mailto:viresh.kumar@linaro.org">Viresh Kumar</a></p>
           </div>
<p>The Linux kernel's generic power domain (genpd) subsystem has been
extended to 
support active state management of the power domains in the 
4.15 development cycle. Power domains were
traditionally used to enable or disable power to a region of a system on
chip (SoC) but, with the recent updates, they can control the clock rate or
amount of power supplied to that region as well.
These changes improve the kernel's ability to run the system's hardware at
the optimal power level for the current workload.

</p>

<p>SoCs have become increasingly complex and power-efficient
over the years. Most of the
IP
blocks in an SoC have independent power-control logic that can be
turned on or off to reduce the power they consume. But
there is also a significant amount of static current leakage that can't
be controlled using the IP-block-specific power logic. SoCs are
normally divided into several regions depending on which IP blocks are
generally used together, so that an unused region can be completely
powered off to eliminate this leakage. These regions of the chip, called 
&quot;power domains&quot;, can be present in a hierarchy and
thus can be nested; a nested domain is called a subdomain of the master
domain. Powering down a power domain results in disabling all the IP blocks
and subdomains controlled by the domain and also stopping any static leakage
in that region of the chip.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel's generic power domains are used to group devices that
share clock or other power resources and are all enabled or disabled
together, though these devices may further have fine-grained control over
individual resources.

Generic power domains support a limited number of operations today,
most of which eventually come down to enabling or disabling the power domain
to avoid static leakage.
<p>
Powering down a power domain can have a penalty
though, as powering it back up later may take a significant amount of
time. Additionally, the power domain controller registers are often only
accessible via the
SPI and I2C buses, which are quite slow. For
that reason, some of the more advanced SoCs have implemented several idle states
for their power domains. A deeper idle state saves more power
for the region the power domain controls, but raises the penalty to
restore power to the domain.  Thus it is important to avoid taking
the power domain to 
a deeper idle state if we already know that we need to power on the
domain after a short amount of time. The idle-state support was recently
added to the generic power domains in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Similar to idle states, some advanced SoCs have implemented various
active states for power domains. The active
states control the clock rate, voltage, or power that the power domain
provides to the region it controls. These active
states are called &quot;performance states&quot; within the Linux
kernel. The higher the performance state, the higher the dynamic power
consumption and the static power leakage of the region controlled by the
domain.</p>

<p>Each device controlled by the power domain can request that the power
domain be configured to a performance state that satisfies the current
performance requirements of the device; the power domain will be
configured to the highest performance state requested by all of its
devices. The performance states (within the genpd core) are identified by
positive integer values; a lower value represents a lower performance
state. The performance state zero is special; devices can request 
this state if they do not want to be considered when
the next performance state for the power domain is calculated.</p>

<p>Linux doesn't enforce a policy on what the values of the performance
states should be.  Platforms can choose any range of consecutive or
non-consecutive values, from 1-10 or 500-550 or anything else they want.
The genpd core only compares these values against each other to find
the highest integer value and passes that value
to the platform-specific genpd callback (described later); that
callback should have knowledge about the valid performance-state
ranges for that platform.</p>

<h4>Internals</h4>

<p>The genpd core provides the following helper for devices to request a
performance state for their power domain:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    int dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state(struct device *dev,
    					   unsigned int state);
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the pointer to the <tt>device</tt> structure and
<tt>state</tt> is the requested performance state for the power domain
that controls the device. This function updates the performance state
constraint of the device on its domain.  The genpd core then finds the
new performance state for the domain based on the current requests from the
various devices the domain controls, then updates the performance state,
if required, of the power domain in a platform-dependent way.  This happens
synchronously and the performance state of the power domain is updated
before this helper
returns. <tt>dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()</tt> returns zero on
success and an error number otherwise. The return value <tt>-ENODEV</tt> is
special; it is returned if the power domain of the device doesn't support
performance states.</p>

<p>On a call to <tt>dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()</tt>, the
genpd core calls the <tt>set_performance_state()</tt> callback of the
power domain if the performance state of the power domain needs to be
updated. This callback must be supplied by the power-domain drivers that
support performance states.</p>

<p>
<pre>
    struct generic_pm_domain {
	int (*set_performance_state)(struct generic_pm_domain *genpd, 
				     unsigned int state);
        /* Many other fields... */
    };
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>genpd</tt> is the generic power domain and
<tt>state</tt> is the target performance state based on the requests
from all the devices managed by the <tt>genpd</tt>. As pointed out
earlier, if the domain doesn't have this callback set, the helper
<tt>dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()</tt> will return
<tt>-ENODEV</tt>.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the performance state of a power domain is
updated is left for the implementation and is platform dependent. For some
platforms, the <tt>set_performance_state()</tt> callback may directly
configure some regulator(s) and/or clock(s) that are managed by
Linux, while in other cases the <tt>set_performance_state()</tt>
callback may end up informing the firmware running on an external processor
(not managed by Linux) about the target performance state, which eventually
may program the power resources locally.</p>

<p>Also note that, in the current implementation, performance-state updates
aren't propagated to the master domains from the subdomains and only
devices (i.e. no subdomains) directly controlled by the power domain are
considered while finding its effective performance state. The reason being that
none of the current hardware designs have a configuration that would need
this feature; more thought needs to be put into that for various reasons.
For example, there may not be a one-to-one mapping between the performance
states 
of subdomains and those of their master domains. We can also have multiple
master 
domains for a subdomain and the master domains may need to be configured
to different performance states for a single performance state of the
subdomain.</p>

<h4>Interaction with the OPP layer</h4>

<p>We have discussed how a device requests a performance-state change
and how that happens internally in the genpd core, but we haven't discussed
how the device drivers know which performance state to request based
on their own performance requirements.

Ideally, this information should come from the device tree (DT)
but, after several rounds of
<a
href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=149410710629056&amp;w=2">discussions</a> 
on the linux-kernel mailing list, it was decided to merge a non-DT solution
first and then attempt to 
add DT bindings for the power-domain performance states later. The DT bindings
are being
<a
href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=150945404818511&amp;w=2">reviewed</a>
currently on the mailing list.</p>

<p>The devices with power-domain performance-state requirements fall
broadly into two categories:</p>

<ul>

<li> <p>Devices with fixed performance requirements that will always
     request the same performance state for their power domain. Drivers
     of such devices can hard-code the performance-state requirement in the
     driver or its platform data until the time that DT bindings are in
     place. Devices with fixed performance-state requirements can call
     <tt>dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()</tt> just once, when
     they are enabled by their drivers, and they don't need to worry about
     power-domain performance states after that, as genpd will always
     consider them while reevaluating power domain's performance state.</p>

<li> <p>Devices with varying performance requirements, based on their own
     operating performance state. An example of such a device would be
     a Multi-Media Card (MMC) controller or a CPU. The rest of this section
     discusses such devices.</p>

</ul>

<p>The discrete tuples, consisting of frequency and voltage pairs,
that the device supports are called &quot;operating performance
points&quot; (OPPs). These were explained in detail in
<a href="/Articles/718632/">this article</a>.
<p>

Devices can have different performance-state requirements than their 
power domain, based on which OPP the devices are currently configured
for. For example, a device may need performance state three for running at
800MHz
and performance state seven to run at 1.2GHz. These devices would
need to call <tt>dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()</tt> whenever
they change their OPP if the performance state of the previous OPP is
different than the new OPP.</p>

<p>The OPP core has been enhanced to store a performance state corresponding to
each OPP of the device and can do the conversion from an OPP to device's
power domain's performance state. The OPP core helper
<tt>dev_pm_opp_set_rate()</tt>  has also been updated to
handle performance-state updates automatically along with clock and
regulator updates.</p>

<p>In the absence of DT bindings to get the performance state corresponding
to each 
OPP of the device, the OPP core has gained a pair of new helpers to link a
device's OPPs to its power domain's performance states.  Note that these
helpers have been added temporarily to the OPP core to support initial
platforms that need to configure the performance states of power
domains. These helpers will be removed once the proposed DT bindings (and
corresponding kernel code) are merged.</p>

<p>
<pre>
    struct opp_table *dev_pm_opp_register_get_pstate_helper(struct device *dev,
    		     int (*get_pstate)(struct device *dev, unsigned long rate));
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the pointer to the <tt>device</tt> structure and
<tt>get_pstate()</tt> is the platform-specific callback that 
returns the performance state corresponding to device's
<tt>rate</tt> on success or an error number on failure.
<tt>dev_pm_opp_register_get_pstate_helper()</tt> returns a pointer to the
OPP table on success and an error number (cast as a pointer) on failure. It
must be called before any OPPs are added for the device, as the OPP core
invokes this callback when OPPs are added to get the performance state
corresponding to those OPPs (and hence target
frequencies). <tt>dev_pm_opp_unregister_get_pstate_helper()</tt> takes
a reference of the OPP table and that must be returned (so that the table can
be freed once we don't need it anymore) with the help of  the following
function:</p>

<p>
<pre>
    void dev_pm_opp_unregister_get_pstate_helper(struct opp_table *opp_table);
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>opp_table</tt> is the pointer to the OPP table, earlier
returned by <tt>dev_pm_opp_register_get_pstate_helper()</tt>.</p>

<p>The basic infrastructure is in place now to implement platform-specific
power-domain drivers that allow configuring performance states. If you want
to implement performance states for your power domains, then all you need
to do is:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Implement a power domain driver (which you would do anyway, with or
     without performance states).</li>

<li> Implement <tt>set_performance_state()</tt> callback for the power
     domain.</li>

<li> Call <tt>dev_pm_opp_register_get_pstate_helper()</tt> from 
     platform-specific code and register your helper routine that can
     convert device OPPs to performance states. Note that this step is only
     required for devices that have OPPs of their own.

<li> Hard-code the performance-state requirements in platform data or
     drivers for 
     devices that do not have changing performance state requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DT bindings proposal is already under review, and code updates
will be sent once the DT bindings are merged. In the future, we may also want to
drive the devices controlled by a power domain at the highest OPP permitted
by the current performance state of the power domain. For example, a device
may have requested performance state five as it needs to run at 900MHz
currently but, because of the votes from other devices (controlled by the
same power domain), the effective performance state selected is eight. At this
point it may be better, power and performance wise, to run the device at
1.3GHz (the highest device OPP supported at performance state eight) as that may
not result in much more power consumption as the power domain is already
configured for state eight.  More thought is needed in this area, though.

Hi,<br>
<p>
Does it cover simple cases, i.e. when the only option is to switch the clock on or off?<br>
As, for example, found on many (all?) Cortex-M based devices?<br>
Or is it a different subsystem, that is responsible there?<br>
<p>

Yes it does. In fact it already did before.<br>
<p>
Note that in Linux terminology, it is not called a "power domain", but a "PM Domain", which is a more broader abstraction.  Devices inside a PM Domain are managed similarly w.r.t. power.  Examples are real power domains/areas, clock domains, or a firmware PM Domain (e.g. ACPI).  I think the clock domain covers what you mean.<br>
<p>
For a clock domain, the clock domain controller has to register a PM Domain, with the GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK flag set, and the .attach_dev() and .detach_dev() callbacks filled in.  Once a device is attached to the clock domain, its clock will be managed automatically from Runtime PM.<br>

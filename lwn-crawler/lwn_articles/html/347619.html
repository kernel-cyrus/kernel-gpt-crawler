<p>
The kernel FIFO implementation, <tt>kfifo</tt>, is not that
widely used and Stefani Seibold would like to see that change.  To that
end, she has <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/347346/">proposed</a> a new
<tt>kfifo</tt> API that embodies many of the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/336255/">design patterns for data
structures</a> that were described by Neil Brown.  The new interface is
simpler in many ways, so it should be easier to use, which, in turn, could
lead to more use throughout the kernel.
</p>

<p>
The basic problems with the current <tt>kfifo</tt> interface stem from the
constraints it places on its users.  A spinlock is required, though it is
not needed by the majority of current <tt>kfifo</tt> users.  Also, the
<tt>kfifo</tt> structure can only be allocated dynamically, so users cannot
put FIFOs inside of other structures&mdash;only pointers to FIFOs.
Moreover, according to Seibold, the current API is too simple and doesn't
provide a number of important features.
</p>

<p>
The new API has 23 separate functions, while the current has 9, but there
are quite a few variants that increase the total.  Those variants include
copying from or to user space, supporting fixed-length records, as well as
being able to use spinlocks to synchronize adding or removing data from the
FIFO.  It 
supports many different use cases in the style of Brown's "Broad
Interfaces" pattern.
</p>

<p>
A <tt>kfifo</tt> is declared using the <tt>DECLARE_KFIFO()</tt> macro which
can be used inside of a 
struct or union declaration.  FIFOs declared with with
<tt>DECLARE_KFIFO()</tt> must be initialized using <tt>INIT_KFIFO()</tt>.
Alternatively, <tt>DEFINE_KFIFO()</tt> 
handles both the declaration and initialization for FIFOs outside of
struct/union declarations.  The macros take <tt>name</tt> (to name the
variable or struct/union element) and <tt>size</tt> (in bytes) parameters:
<pre>
    DECLARE_KFIFO(name, size)
    INIT_KFIFO(name)

    DEFINE_KFIFO(name, size)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There are two functions to support dynamic buffer allocation:
<pre>
    int kfifo_alloc(struct kfifo *fifo, unsigned int size, gfp_t gfp_mask)
</pre>
which allocates a buffer of <tt>size</tt> bytes using the <tt>gfp_mask</tt>
as flags to pass to <tt>kmalloc()</tt>.   Or, a pre-allocated buffer can be
attached to a <tt>kfifo</tt> using:
<pre>
    void kfifo_init(struct kfifo *fifo, unsigned char *buffer, unsigned int size)
</pre>
Any buffer allocated by <tt>kfifo_alloc()</tt> should later be freed by
calling <tt>kfifo_free()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
To put data into the FIFO, <tt>kfifo_in()</tt> is used:
<pre>
    unsigned int kfifo_in(struct kfifo *fifo, 
        unsigned char *from, unsigned int n)
</pre>
which returns the number of bytes stored.  As mentioned above there are
variants for getting the data from user space, as well as for locking:
<pre>
    unsigned int kfifo_from_user(struct kfifo *fifo, 
        const void __user *from, unsigned int n)

    unsigned int kfifo_in_locked(struct kfifo *fifo,
	const unsigned char *from, unsigned int n, spinlock_t *lock)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
As one might guess, the calls to remove data from the FIFO look
similar&mdash;if reversed:
<pre>
    unsigned int kfifo_out(struct kfifo *fifo, 
        unsigned char *to, unsigned int n)

    unsigned int kfifo_to_user(struct kfifo *fifo, 
        void __user *to, unsigned int n)

    unsigned int kfifo_out_locked(struct kfifo *fifo,
	unsigned char *to, unsigned int n, spinlock_t *lock)
</pre>
In the common case, with only one reader and one writer, extra locks are not
required to add or remove data from the FIFO, but for more complicated
scenarios, the <tt>*_locked()</tt> variants allow the caller to use the
appropriate lock.
</p>

<p>
The expected tests for FIFO full and empty (<tt>kfifo_is_full()</tt> and
<tt>kfifo_is_empty()</tt>) are present, as are ways to get FIFO size and
available space (<tt>kfifo_size()</tt>, <tt>kfifo_len()</tt>, and
<tt>kfifo_avail()</tt>).  One can also consume some FIFO bytes
without returning them using <tt>kfifo_skip()</tt> or clear the entire FIFO with
<tt>kfifo_reset()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
There is also support for fixed-length records, with either 1- or 2-byte
lengths stored with each entry.  Each call must pass a <tt>recsize</tt>
parameter that specifies the size of the length field (i.e. 1 or 2, though
0 is supported for no length) stored with each
entry:
<pre>
    unsigned int kfifo_in_rec(struct kfifo *fifo,
	void *from, unsigned int n, unsigned int recsize)

    unsigned int kfifo_from_user_rec(struct kfifo *fifo,
	const void __user *from, unsigned int n, unsigned int recsize)

    unsigned int kfifo_out_rec(struct kfifo *fifo,
	void *to, unsigned int n, unsigned int recsize,
	unsigned int *total)

    unsigned int kfifo_to_user_rec(struct kfifo *fifo,
	void __user *to, unsigned int n, unsigned int recsize,
	unsigned int *total)

</pre>
These functions return the number of bytes <i>not</i> copied, which is a
bit strange.  For the functions that remove data from the FIFO,
<tt>*total</tt> stores the number of bytes actually copied.  This part of
the interface seems a little dubious, and may not survive in its present
form, though no comments along those lines have been seen. 
</p>

<p>
Overall, the interface has been fairly well-received.  There were a few
comments on an <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/347168/">earlier
version</a> of the API, which Seibold has mostly addressed.  The only
comments on the most recent version (v0.4) were a disagreement between Alan
Cox and Andrew Morton over naming conventions.
</p>

<p>
Cox would rather not see the current <tt>kfifo_put()</tt> and
<tt>kfifo_get()</tt> calls get removed quite yet, <a
href="/Articles/347724/">noting</a>
"<q>We are about to set fifo loose through all the USB and some other
char/serial drivers all of which will use the spinlock facility.</q>"
The current calls use the spinlock, so the kind of change Seibold is
proposing would need to be reflected in the USB and char/serial driver code.  But
Morton  <a href="/Articles/347725/">thinks</a> that this is the right time
to make those changes, because 
"<q>kfifo has no business assuming that the caller wants to use
spin_lock() locking</q>".
</p>

<p>
The basic problem is that Morton would like to see a convention followed
that things like <tt>kfifo_put()</tt> (or, <tt>kfifo_in()</tt> as Seibold's
API defines it) do not assume locking.  He agrees with Seibold's decision
to add a separate <tt>kfifo_*_locked()</tt> variants.  Cox <a
href="/Articles/347731/">points out</a> that the convention is very
inconsistently followed, but Morton is <a
href="/Articles/347732/">adamant</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Plus, as I've said enty en times and keep getting ignored: the current
naming is wrong.  The generic kfifo_get() should not be assuming that
the caller wants spinlock-based locking.
</div>
</p>

<p> After initially NAK-ing part of the patch, Cox seems to have <a
href="/Articles/347733/">relented</a>, 
so that particular barrier is gone.  It would seem far too late in the
2.6.31 process for this kind of change to go in, but unless some other
major issues crop up, it is quite possible that a new <tt>kfifo</tt> API
could show up in 2.6.32.  </p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

About the record handling:<br>
<p>
The record functions supports three kinds of record types:<br>
<p>
- Records with a fixed size of bytes<br>
- Records with a variable length between 0 and 255 bytes<br>
- Records with a variable length between 0 and 65535 bytes<br>
<p>
The return value of the record handling functions is well thought, because it makes it much easier to determinate if the function fails:<br>
<p>
- 0 means everything is okay<br>
- a return value lower or equal then the passed length means that the copy_*_user() function has failed<br>
- a value greater the passed length means the record does not fit into the destination buffer/fifo.<br>
<p>
It makes no sense to cut off a record, so a return value not equal 0 signals a failure.<br>
<p>
Add the *total pointer to the record out functions makes sense, if using variable length records. There must be a way to return the length of the processed record, otherwise the caller don't know the size of the variable length record. You can set the *total pointer to NULL if this value is not requiered.<br>

The device tree issue was omnipresent during the 2013 Kernel Summit, with
dedicated minisummit sessions, hallway discussions, and an interminable
mailing list thread all in the mix.  Despite all the noise, though, some
progress was seemingly made on the issue of how to evolve device tree
bindings without breaking systems that depend on them.  A group of
developers presented those results to the plenary session.
<p>
Grant Likely and David Woodhouse started by reiterating the problems that
led to the adoption 
of device trees for the ARM architecture in the first place.  It comes down
to undiscoverable hardware — hardware that does not describe itself to the
CPU, and which thus cannot be enumerated automatically.  This hardware is

not just a problem with embedded ARM systems, Grant said; it is showing up
in desktop and server systems too.  In many situations, we are seeing the
need for a general hardware description mechanism.  The problem is coming
up with the best way of doing this description while supporting systems
that were shipped with intermediate device tree versions.
<p>
The solution comes down to a set of process changes, starting with a
statement that device tree bindings are, indeed, considered to be stable by
default.  Once a binding has been included in a kernel release, developers
should not break systems that are using that binding.  That said,
developers should not get hung up on creating perfect bindings now; we
still do not know all of the common patterns and will need to make changes
as we learn things.
That means that bindings can, in fact, change after they have been released
in a kernel; the key is to make those changes in the correct way.
<p>
Another decision that has been made is that configuration data is allowed
within device tree bindings.  This has been a controversial area; many
developers feel that device trees should describe the hardware and nothing
else.  Grant made the claim that much configuration data should be
considered part of the hardware design; there may be a region of memory
intended for use as graphics buffers, for example.

<p>
There will be a staging-like mechanism for unstable bindings, but it
expected that this mechanism will almost never be used.  The device tree
developers will be producing a document describing the recommended best
practices and processes around device trees; there will also be a set of
validation tools.  Much of this work, it is hoped, will be completed within
the next year.
<p>
The current rule that device tree bindings must be documented will be
reinforced.  The documentation lives in
<tt>Documentation/devicetree/bindings</tt> in the kernel tree.  The device
tree maintainers would prefer to see these documents posted as a separate
patch within a series so they can find it quickly.  Bindings should get an
acknowledgment from the device tree maintainers, but there is already too
much review work to be done in this area.  So, if the device tree
maintainers are slow in getting to a patch, subsystem maintainers are
considered empowered to merge bindings without an ack.  These changes
should go through the usual subsystem tree.
<p>
The compatibility rules say that new kernels must work with older device
trees.  If changes are required, they should be put into new properties;
the old ones can then be deprecated but not removed.  New properties should
be optional, so that device trees lacking those properties continue to
work.  The device tree developers will provide a set of guidelines for the
creation of future-proof bindings.
<p>
If it becomes absolutely necessary to introduce an incompatible change,
Grant said, the first step is that the developer must submit to the
mandatory public flogging.  After that, if need be, developers should come
up with a new "compatible" string and start over, while, of course, still
binding against the older string if that is all that is available.  DTS
files (which hold a complete device tree for a specific system) should
contain either the new or the old compatible string, but never both.
<p>
If all else fails, it is still permissible to add quirks in the code for
specific hardware.  If this is done with care, it should not reproduce the
old board file problem; such quirks should be relatively rare.

Ben Herrenschmidt worried about the unstable binding mechanism; it is
inevitable, he thought, that manufacturers would ship hardware using
unstable bindings.  David replied that bad manufacturer behavior
is not limited to bindings; they ship a lot of strange code as well.  But,
he said, manufacturers have learned over time that things go a lot easier
if they work with upstream-supported code.  He didn't think that the
unstable binding mechanism would ever be used; it is a "political
compromise" that should never need to be employed.  Arnd Bergmann added
that, should this ever happen, it will not be the end of the world; the
kernel community just has to make the consequences of shipping unstable
bindings clear.  In such cases, users will just have to update the device
tree in their hardware before they can install a newer kernel.
<p>
What about the reviewer bandwidth problem?  The main change in this area,
it seems, is that the device tree reviewers will <i>only</i> look at the
binding documentation; they will not look at the driver code itself.  That
is part of why they want the documentation in a separate patch.  That means
that subsystem maintainers will have to be a bit more involved in ensuring
that the code matches the documentation — though there will be some tools
that will help in that area as well.

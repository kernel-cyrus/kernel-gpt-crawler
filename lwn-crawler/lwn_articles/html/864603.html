<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 2, 2021</br>
           </div>
The kernel-development community is a busy place, with thousands of emails
flying by every day and many different projects under development at any
given time. Much of 
that work ends up inspiring articles at LWN, but there is no way to ever
cover all of it, or even all of the most interesting parts.  What follows
is a first attempt at what may become a semi-regular LWN feature: a quick look
at some of the work that your editor is tracking that may or may not show
up as the topic of a full article in the future.  The first set of topics
includes memory folios, task isolation, and a lightweight threading
framework from Google.
<p>
<h4>Memory folios</h4>
<p>
The memory folios work was <a href="/Articles/849538/">covered here in
March</a>; this patch set by Matthew Wilcox adds the concept of a "folio"
as a page that is guaranteed not to be a tail page within a <a
href="/Articles/619514/">compound page</a>.  By guaranteeing that a folio
is either a singleton page or the head of a compound page, this work
enables the creation of an API that adds some useful structure to memory
management, saves some memory, and slightly improves performance for some
workloads.
<p>
While the memory-management community is still not fully sold on this
concept (it looks like a lot of change for a small benefit to some
developers), it 
looks increasingly likely that it will be merged in the near future.  Or, at
least, the merging process will start; one does not swallow a 138-part (at
last count) memory-management patch series in a single step.  In mid-July,
Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YPBs+hcxo31JanPM@casper.infradead.org/">presented</a>
his plan, which involves getting the first 89 patches merged for 5.15; the
rest of the series would be merged during the following two development
cycles.  Nobody seems to be contesting that schedule at this point.
<p>
Later in July, though, Wilcox <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YPxNkRYMuWmuRnA5@casper.infradead.org/">stumbled
across</a> the inevitable <a
href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Folios-v14-Testing-AMD-Linux">Phoronix
benchmarking article</a> which purported to show an 80% performance
improvement for PostgreSQL with the folio patches applied to the kernel.
He said that the result was "<q>plausibly real</q>" and suggested
that, perhaps, the merging of folios should be accelerated.  Other
developers responded more skeptically, though.  PostgreSQL developer Andres
Freund looked at how the results were generated and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210724214413.fqsbjxhhodfzchs6@alap3.anarazel.de/">concluded</a>
that the test "<q>doesn't end up measuring something particularly
interesting</q>".  His own test showed a 7% improvement, though, which
is (as he noted) still a nice improvement.
<p>
The end result is that the case for folios seems to be getting stronger,
and the merging process still appears to be set to begin in
5.15.
<p>
<h4>Retrying task isolation</h4>
<P>
Last year, the development community <a href="/Articles/816298/">discussed a
task-isolation mode</a> that would allow latency-sensitive applications to
run on a CPU with no interruptions from the kernel.  That work never ended
up being merged, but the interest in this mode clearly still exists, as can
be seen in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727103803.464432924@fuller.cnet/">this patch
set</a> from Marcelo Tosatti.  It takes a simpler approach to the problem â€”
initially, at least.
<p>
This patch is focused, in particular, on kernel interruptions that can happen
even when a CPU is running in the <a href="/Articles/549580/">"nohz"
mode</a> without a clock tick. 
Specifically, he is looking at the "vmstat" code that performs housekeeping
for the memory-management subsystem.  Some of this work is done in a
separate thread (via a workqueue) that is normally disabled while a CPU is
running in the nohz mode.  There are situations, though, that can cause
this thread to be rescheduled on a nohz CPU, ending the application's
exclusive use of that processor.
<p>
Tosatti's patch set adds a set of new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
commands to address this problem.  The <tt>PR_ISOL_SET</tt> command sets
the "isolation parameters", which can be either <tt>PR_ISOL_MODE_NONE</tt>
or <tt>PR_ISOL_MODE_NORMAL</tt>; the latter asks the kernel to eliminate
interruptions.  Those parameters do not take effect, though, until the task
actually enters the isolation mode, which can be done with
the <tt>PR_ISOL_ENTER</tt> command.  The kernel's response to
entering the isolation mode will be to perform any deferred vmstat work
immediately so that the kernel will not decide to do it at an inconvenient
time later.  The deferred-work cleanup will happen at the end of any system
call made while isolation mode is active; since those system calls are the
likely source of any deferred work in the first place, that should keep the
decks clear while the application code is running.

<p>
The evident intent is to make this facility more general, guaranteeing that
<i>any</i> deferred work would be executed right away.  That led others
(including <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/7b2d6bf91d30c007e19a7d2cbddcb2460e72d163.camel@redhat.com/">NicolÃ¡s
SÃ¡enz</a>) to question the use of a single mode to control what will
eventually be a number of different kernel operations.  Splitting out the
various behaviors would, he said, be a way to move any policy decisions to
user space.  After some
back-and-forth, Tosatti <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210727145209.GA518735@fuller.cnet/">agreed</a> to
a modified interface that would give user space explicit control over each
potential isolation feature.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210730201827.269106165@fuller.cnet/">A patch
set</a> implementing this API was posted on July&nbsp;30; it adds a new
operation (<tt>PR_ISOL_FEAT</tt>) to query the set of actions that can be
quiesced while the isolation mode is active.

<p>
Bonus fact: newer members of our community may not be aware that,
20&nbsp;years ago, Tosatti was known as <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011119051210/http://marcelothewonderpenguin.com/">Marcelo
the Wonder Penguin</a>.

<h4>User-managed concurrency groups</h4>
<p>
In May of this year, Peter Oskolkov posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210520183614.1227046-1-posk@google.com/">a patch
set</a> for a mechanism called "user-managed concurrency groups", or UMCG.
This work is evidently a version of a scheduling framework known as "Google
Fibers", which is naturally one of the most ungoogleable terms imaginable.
This patch set has suffered from a desultory attempt to explain what it is
actually supposed to implement, but the basic picture is becoming more
clear over time.  
<p>
UMCG is meant to be a lightweight, user-space-controlled, M:N threading
mechanism; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAPNVh5feas6o_8pk5-kiujTDJf6XT4uxapxC4eZokaj%2Biv%3DrqQ%40mail.gmail.com/">this
document</a>, posted after some prodding, describes its core concepts.  A
user-space process can set up one or more concurrency groups to manage its
work.  Within each group, there will be one or more "server" threads; the
plan seems to be that applications would set up one server thread for each
available CPU.
There will also be any number of "worker" threads that carry out the
jobs that the application needs done.  At any given time, each server
thread can be running one worker.  User space will
control which worker threads are running at any time by attaching them to
servers; notifications for events like workers blocking on I/O allow the
servers to be kept busy.
<p>
In the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210801200617.623745-1-posk@google.com/">August 1
version of the patch set</a>, there are two system calls defined to
manage this mechanism.  A call to <tt>umcg_ctl()</tt> will register a
thread as an UMCG task, in either the server or the worker mode; it can
also perform unregistration.  <tt>umcg_wait()</tt> is the main scheduling
mechanism; a worker thread can use it to pause execution, for example.  But
a server thread can also use <tt>umcg_wait()</tt> to wake a specific
worker thread or to force a context switch from one worker thread to
another; the call will normally block for as long as the worker continues to 
run.  Once <tt>umcg_wait()</tt> returns, the server thread can select a new
worker to execute next.
<p>
Or so it seems; there is little documentation for how these system calls
are really meant to be used and no sample code at all.  The most recent
version of the series did, finally, include <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210801200617.623745-4-posk@google.com/">a
description of the system calls</a>, something that had been entirely
absent in previous versions.  Perhaps as a
result, this work has seen relatively little review activity so far.
Oskolkov seems to be focused on how the in-kernel functionality is
implemented, but reviewers are going to want to take a long and hard look at the
user-space API, which would have to be supported indefinitely if this
subsystem were to be merged.  UMCG looks like interesting and potentially
useful work, but this kind of core-kernel change is hard to merge in the
best of conditions; the absence of information on what is being proposed
has made that process harder so far.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yeah, please make this a &quot;a semi-regular LWN feature&quot;, otherwise that field is left to websites that don&#x27;t get even close to the stellar quality reporting here at LWN.net â€“ which is not in the interest of the Linux world, as those websites sometimes inadvertently get things wrong and thus spread misconceptions with their reporting.<br>

assert( (prctl(PR_ISOL_FEAT, 0, 0, 0, 0) &amp; ISOL_F_QUIESCE) != 0);<br>
int max_silence = prctl(PR_ISOL_FEAT, ISOL_F_QUIESCE, 0, 0, 0);<br>
assert( prctl(PR_ISOL_SET, ISOL_F_QUIESCE, max_silence, 0, 0) &gt;= 0);<br>
assert( prctl(PR_ISOL_CTRL_SET, ISOL_F_QUIESCE, 0, 0, 0) &gt;= 0);<br>
<p>
Correct? (Assuming I&#x27;m not afraid of regressions..what regressions?)<br>

Thanks,Jon. This will certainly helpful for the quick view of what is churnning in the oven(aka kernel). I mean, those who do not follow the lkml rigorously can get hugely benefitted by this. <br>

And yet another person chiming in here to say they are a huge fan of a &quot;view of the lands&quot; posts like this. It helps us who work with the kernel but not lurk the mailing lists keep a finger on the pulse of upstream.<br>
<p>
While the Google Fibers patch seems interesting, I have serious qualms on anything from Google being subject to the kernels requirement of never breaking userspace, and therefore requiring that API be supported forever. Google is known to throw stuff at the wall and quickly abandon it if it falls out of grace, which is an extremely incompatible perspective on what the Linux kernel does. And to submit it without any example code is just, well, to me seems like a bad faith submission and makes me feel it should be looked with even more scrutiy than other such feature additions (in similar scope).<br>

      <p>The whole server infrastructure of Google is built around fibers nowadays thus one can be reasonably sure they are not going anywhere.</p>

<p>This being said the chances are high that what was actually presented is what Kubernetes was in relation to <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>: reimplementation of the same, tried and tested, idea but with an entirely different code and API.</p>

<p>Thus obviously API discussion is very much needed.</p>

      We can consider that, but ... everything that was on the kernel page before is still to be found in the weekly edition; from the kernel point of view no content has been lost at all.  So bringing back that page wouldn't necessarily help much.

<p>
Creating a union of two (or more) filesystems is a commonly requested
feature for 
Linux that has never made it into the mainline.  Various implementations
have been tried (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">part 1</a> and
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327738/">part 2</a> of Valerie Aurora's
look from early 2009), but none has crossed the threshold for inclusion.
Of late, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/396020/">union mounts</a> have
been making some progress, but there is still work to do there.  A hybrid
approach&mdash;incorporating both filesystem- and VFS-based
techniques&mdash;has recently been posted in an <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/402276/">RFC patchset</a> by Miklos Szeredi.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind unioning filesystems is quite simple, but the devil is in
the details.  In a union, one filesystem is mounted "atop" another, with
the contents of both filesystems appearing to be in a single filesystem
encompassing both.  Changes made to the filesystem are reflected in the
"upper" filesystem, and the "lower" filesystem is treated as read-only.
One common use case is to have a filesystem on read-only media (e.g. CD)
but allow users to make changes by writing to the upper filesystem stored
on read-write media (e.g. flash or disk).
</p>

<p>
There are a number of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">details</a>
that bedevil developers of unions, however, including various problems with
namespace handling, dealing with deleted files and directories, the
POSIX definition of <tt>readdir()</tt>, and so on.  None of them are
insurmountable, 
but they are difficult, and it is even harder to implement them in a way
that doesn't run afoul of the technical complaints of the VFS maintainers.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi's approach blends the filesystem-based implementations, like
unionfs and aufs, with the VFS-based implementation of union mounts.
For file objects, an <tt>open()</tt> is forwarded to whichever of the two
underlying filesystems contains it, while directories are handled by the
union filesystem layer.
Neil Brown's very helpful first cut at <a
href="/Articles/403038/">documentation</a> for the patches lumped directory
handling in with files, but Szeredi <a href="/Articles/403049/">called
that a bug</a>.  Directory access is never forwarded to the other
filesystems and directories need to "<q>come from the union itself
for various reasons</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
As outlined in Brown's document, most of the action for unions takes place
in directories.  For one thing, it is more accurate to look at the feature
as unioning directory trees, rather than filesystems, as there is no
requirement that the two trees reside in separate filesystems.  In theory,
the lower tree could even be another union, but the current implementation
precludes that.
</p>

<p>
The filesystem used by the upper tree needs to support the "trusted"
extended attributes (xattrs) and
it must also provide valid <tt>d_type</tt> (file type)
for <tt>readdir()</tt> responses, which precludes NFS.
Whiteouts&mdash;that is files that exist in the lower tree, but have been
removed in the upper&mdash;are handled using the "trusted.union.whiteout"
xattr.  Similarly, opaque directories, which do not allow entries in the
lower tree to "show through", are handled with the "trusted.union.opaque"
xattr. 
</p>

<p>
Directory entries are merged with fairly straightforward rules: if there
are entries 
in both the upper and lower layers with the same name, the upper always
takes precedence unless both are directories.  In that case, a directory in
the union is created that merges the entries from each.  The initial mount
creates a merged directory of the roots of the upper and lower directory
trees and subsequent lookups follow the rules, creating merged
directories that get cached in the union dentry as needed.
</p>

<p>
Write access to lower layer files is handled by the traditional "copy up"
approach.  So, opening a lower file for write or changing its metadata will
cause the file to be copied to the upper tree.  That may require creating
any intervening directories if the file is several levels down in a
directory tree on the lower layer.  Once that's done, though, the hybrid
union filesystem has little further interaction with the file, at least
directly, because operations and handed off to the upper filesystem.

<p>
The patchset is relatively small, and makes very few small changes to
VFS&mdash;except for a change to <tt>struct&nbsp;inode_operations</tt> that ripples
through the filesystem tree.  The <tt>permissions()</tt> member of that
structure currently takes a <tt>struct&nbsp;inode&nbsp;*</tt>, but the hybrid union
filesystem needs to be able to access the filesystem-specific data
(<tt>d_fsdata</tt>) that is stored in the dentry, so it was changed to take
a <tt>struct&nbsp;dentry&nbsp;*</tt> instead.  David P. Quigley <a
href="/Articles/403070/">questioned</a> the need for the change, noting
that unionfs and aufs did not require it.  Aurora <a
href="/Articles/403071/">pointed out</a> that union mounts would require
something similar and that, along with Brown's documentation, seemed to put
the matter to rest.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the patches make minor changes. The first adds a new
<tt>struct&nbsp;file_operations</tt> member called <tt>open_other()</tt>
that is used to forward <tt>open()</tt> calls to the upper or lower layers
as appropriate.  Another allows filesystems to set a
<tt>FS_RENAME_SELF_ALLOW</tt> flag so that <tt>rename()</tt> will still process
renames on the identical dummy inodes that the filesystem uses for
non-directories.  The bulk of the code (modulo the <tt>permissions()</tt>
change) is the new <a href="/Articles/403081/"><tt>fs/union</tt>
filesystem</a> itself. 
</p>

<p>
While "union" tends to be used for these kinds of filesystems (or mounts),
Brown <a href="/Articles/403084/">noted</a> that it is confusing and not
really accurate, suggesting that "overlay" be used in its place.  Szeredi
is not opposed to that, <a href="/Articles/403085/">saying</a> that
"overlayfs" might make more sense.  Aurora more or less <a
href="/Articles/403086/">concurred</a>, saying that union mounts were
called "writable overlays" for one release.  The confusion stemming from
multiple 
uses of "union" in existing patches (unionfs, union mounts) may provide
additional reason to rename the hybrid union filesystem to overlayfs.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>readdir()</tt> semantics are a bit different for the hybrid union as
well.  Changes to merged directories while they are being read will not
appear in the entries returned by <tt>readdir()</tt>, and offsets returned
from <tt>telldir()</tt> may not return to the same location in a merged
directory on subsequent directory opens.  The lists of directory entries in
merged directories are created and cached on the first <tt>readdir()</tt>
call, with offsets assigned sequentially as they are read.  For the most
part, these changes are "<q>unlikely to be noticed by many
programs</q>", as Brown's documentation says.
</p>

<p>
A bigger issue is one that all union implementations struggle with: how to
handle changes to either layer that are done outside of the context of the
union.  If users or administrators directly change the underlying
filesystems, there are a number of ugly corner cases.  Making the lower
filesystem be 
read-only is an 
attractive solution, but it is non-trivial to enforce, especially for
filesystems like NFS.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi would like to define the problem
away or find some way to enforce the requirements that unioning
imposes:
<div class="BigQuote">
The easiest way out of this mess might simply be to enforce exclusive
modification to the underlying filesystems on a local level, same as
the union mount strategy.  For NFS and other remote filesystems we
either
<p>
 a) add some way to enforce it,<br>
 b) live with the consequences if not enforced on the system level, or<br>
 c) disallow them to be part of the union.
</div>
<p>
There was some discussion of the problem, without much in the way of
conclusions other than a requirement that changing the trees out from under
the union filesystem not cause deadlocks or panics.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, hybrid union seems a simpler approach than union mounts.
Whether it can pass muster with Al Viro and other filesystem maintainers
remains to be seen however.  One way or another, though, some kind of
solution to the lack of an overlay/union filesystem in the
mainline seems to be getting closer.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

From my perspective, if you union mount e.g. an NFS file system and then star modifying the underlying filesystem directly, you deserve every bit of pain coming to you. It makes perfect sense to enforce anything that can be reasonably enforced, such as making sure that local file systems must be mounted read only in order to be part of a union mount, but I fail to see why one should artificially exclude e.g. NFS file systems simply because making those sanity checks aren't possible on a remote file system. <br>
<p>
How about having an ounce of trust in the universe; competent sysadmins will get it right, and the rooting out incompetent sysadmins quickly is actually a good thing?<br>

It isn't about trust, it is about providing predictable behaviour in all circumstances, even weird corner cases...  So maybe that is about trust - you should be able to trust the unionfs to behave predictably.<br>
<p>
In your taxonomy of sys-admins you forgot to include the brilliant/insane ones who *know* exactly how every union-mount is being used and *knows* that a particular file that they want to upgrade isn't being used at the moment so if they replace it on the common underlay then everyone will smoothly see the new content.<br>
<p>
To serve their interests you want unionfs to perform predictably in that situation, so that if they try something and it works, then it is likely that it will work again next time.  So it is important for unionfs to understand and handle any changes in the underlying fs.<br>

if your underlying filesystem is a default system image and your union is then a specific system, it makes a huge amount of sense to want the ability to update the underlying filesystem and have everything using a union pick up the changes.<br>
<p>
you may be able to unmount the overlay, but then when you re-mount it, how do you know what to do to resolve changes? In some cases you may want the new file from the underlying layer, in some cases you want the modified version from the top layer, and in many cases what you really want is the changes that were made between the old underlying file and the old upper layer to be made to the new underlying file into the new upper layer.<br>

I'd like to clarify my stance on inode_permission a bit. In this implementation what they want to do would be needed. However something that wasn't captured since Val and I had a brief exchange offlist was that I believe that her proposed implementation is superior to pushing the dentry into inode_permission. She had a new function called path_permission. With the inclusion of the path based hooks in the LSM framework I think if you want to add anything that will be checking permissions based on path we've decided that it should be its own check. That's why adding a path_permission check at the appropriate points in the vfs is a superior situation to pushing the dentry down into the inode operation.<br>

Here is a question for you - why should 'readlink' take a dentry while 'permission' only gets the inode?<br>
<p>
I don't know either, but given the prevalence of dentry being passed around, it seems hard to justify not letting permission get a dentry.<br>
<p>
The core reason that the hybrid unionfs needs permission() to take a dentry is because Miklos chose to store the 'struct union_entry' in the dentry rather than in the inode.  It would be fairly straight forward to store that structure in the inode instead, thus removing any need to change 'permission'.  However that would require allocating an inode for every active file (rather than just for each directory) which might be seen as a waste of memory.<br>
<p>
The concept of "permission checking based on path", while seemingly suggested by the change-log entry for the patch which gives dentry to permission(), is actually irrelevant here.<br>

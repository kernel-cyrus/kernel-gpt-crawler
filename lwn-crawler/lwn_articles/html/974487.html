<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> was a development
conference, where discussion was prioritized and presentations with a lot
of slides were discouraged.  Paul McKenney seemingly flouted this
convention in a joint session of the storage, filesystem, and
memory-management tracks where he presented about 50&nbsp;slides â€” in five
minutes, twice.  The subject was the use of the read-copy-update (RCU)
mechanism in the memory-reclaim process, and whether changes to RCU would
be needed for that purpose.
<p>
Readers who are unfamiliar with RCU may want to have a look at <a
href="/Articles/262464/">this article</a> for a refresher.
<p>
After the slide deluge (for which it was not possible to take effective
notes without severe keyboard damage), McKenney got to his real point:
before making complicated changes to the RCU subsystem (which does not lack
complexity already), a real problem with the current code will need to be
demonstrated.  The concern seems to be that RCU is simply too slow in
getting around to freeing memory, causing the system to go into an
out-of-memory state.  What can be done about that?
<p>
<a href="/Articles/974490/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/PaulMcKenney-sm.png" alt="[Paul McKenney]"
title="Paul McKenney" class="rthumb"></a>

The question of whether RCU can keep up with the work presented to it is,
he said, dependent on the workload.  There can be a few reasons why it
would fail; perhaps the grace periods (the delay before RCU callbacks can
be run) are too infrequent, or there may be readers holding the RCU lock
for too long.  Kent Overstreet tried to give some background for the
current topic, which is a spin-off from <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/Zdkxfspq3urnrM6I@bombadil.infradead.org/">a lengthy
pre-conference discussion</a> on buffered-I/O performance.  The buffered
read path is fast now, he said, but it can be made faster by using RCU.
But that means using RCU to free page-cache pages, which is a critical
cleanup path in the kernel.
<p>
McKenney suggested that, as an experiment, developers could try just
forcing page-free operations through RCU for no particular reason, just to
see if anything breaks.  Josef Bacik said that, while there are places
where RCU can be improved, this use case is pushing for a solution to a
problem that is not RCU's fault.  Writeback from page-cache pages can take
a long time; page reclaim is an unpredictable process in general.
<p>
Overstreet agreed that reclaim is a hard problem, and that a lot of
different developers have responsibility for parts of it.  He is a
filesystem developer who finds himself having to solve reclaim problems,
but the kernel lacks the sort of introspection that would help him to see
where the problems are.  Thus, he said, there is a need for a wider
discussion about the interactions around the reclaim problem.
<p>
James Bottomley asked whether it was appropriate to use RCU in this way;
perhaps there is a need to invent a new mechanism instead?  McKenney
answered that, instead, developers could use a different flavor of RCU,
such as <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable RCU</a>.  Steven Rostedt
asked whether a new RCU flavor aimed at the reclaim problem is needed, but
McKenney said he did not think that was the case.
<p>
It was this far into the session before Dave Chinner got up to ask what the
problem to be solved was.  The short answer is "making the buffer cache
faster".  Matthew Wilcox said that taking folio references for small
reads is simply too expensive; RCU can be used instead to keep pages around
while data is copied from them without the need to take a reference.
McKenney suggested that perhaps <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer">hazard pointers</a>
could be used for this purpose.  That would allow the immediate freeing of
any object that is not currently referenced; RCU, instead, must wait for
all readers to complete their work.
<p>
Bottomley said that the reference-count problem comes down to the cost of
converting cache lines to exclusive access.  If there is not actually a lot
of contention for those reference counts, perhaps a different solution is
called for.  Overstreet answered that, even in the no-contention case, the
reference-counting overhead is a problem; Wilcox suggested that Bottomley
was underestimating the number of places in the kernel that take
references. 
<p>
McKenney tried to direct the conversation toward an understanding of the
performance problem; Overstreet answered that better numbers are needed.
He would like to be able to track just how much memory is waiting in the
RCU system to be freed.  McKenney answered that, while <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/kernel/rcu/tree.c#L3405"><tt>kvfree_call_rcu()</tt></a>
is aware of the size of the memory block it has been asked to free, it is
used infrequently.  Most memory is freed using <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/kernel/rcu/tree.c#L2792"><tt>call_rcu()</tt></a>,
and that function has no idea of how much memory it will eventually free
(or whether it is freeing memory at all).  There is also no per-subsystem
accounting in RCU.  Hannes Reinecke said that he would like to see
subsystem-level accounting, along with the ability to force a grace period
for a specific subsystem.  The problem there, as somebody pointed out, is
that the ability to free a specific range of memory may depend on other
subsystems, and there is no way to know for sure.
<p>
Chinner said that this is a problem of tracking objects in flight.  It is
possible to count slab objects, since they know which
slab they belong to and their size; it's just a matter of adding the
tracking.  Calls to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/include/linux/rcupdate.h#L966"><tt>kfree_rcu()</tt></a>
could recognize slab objects and account for them.  McKenney said that he
would like to see <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> merged into the slab allocator; slab
maintainer Vlastimil Babka said that he had plans to do exactly that.  Now
that the SLOB allocator has been removed, he said, kernel code can pass any
memory pointer to <tt>kfree()</tt> (and thus <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt>) and the
right thing will happen.
<p>
As this somewhat inconclusive session came to a close, McKenney said that
there were two problems to be solved.  If the system is loaded with memory
demands, how are those to be accounted for?  And, for memory freed with
<tt>call_rcu()</tt>, more information will need to be provided somehow.
Overstreet got in the last word by saying that, if a kernel subsystem is
using <tt>call_rcu()</tt>, the duty of performing the accounting is also
there.  <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> should be used instead whenever possible.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

My ask is just to add a global percpu counter for "amount of memory stranded waiting for kfree_rcu() et. all to complete"<br>
<p>
Paul mentioned the idea of per subsystem accounting; instead of doing it per subsystem, we can add it to the (just merged) memory allocation profiling - per callsite.<br>

      On your ask, understood.

<p>Please see the "Tracking Memory Waiting on RCU" section of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10DXs6pnvVgOb5A7hen6RGq2Z8n2hw4Y3yCmH3FwphHM/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a> for a list of approaches that have been considered and a number of the resulting complications.

<p>Thoughts?

<p>I am glad that neither Jon nor Jake injured either themselves or their keyboards during those two leisurely strolls through the slides.  ;&ndash;)

<p>There were several hours worth of discussion in the cited email thread, so the purpose of the slides was for me to quickly figure out what people wanted to focus on.

<p>Those wanting to know more about the possibility of hazard pointers in the Linux kernel might find something of interest <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/113WFjGlAW4m72xNbZWHUSE-yU2HIJnWpiXp91ShtgeE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.  Boqun Feng is working on a prototype, in which a number of people expressed interest during subsequent hallway-track sessions.  TL;DR: Situations in which performance and/or scalability is being limited by a not-zero atomic increment of a reference count might be well served by hazard pointers.  (In addition to the memory-footprint motivation called out in the article.)

A few years ago each SRCU instance was effectively independent and synchronize_srcu_expedited (which could busy wait but is nowhere as bad as its _rcu counterpart) was guaranteed to be basically instantaneous if there was no long running usage of srcu_read_lock/unlock. This was a bit counter to the "sleepable" RCU name, but in fact I always thought of it more as a "subsystem" RCU.<br>
<p>
Since then, SRCU has been rewritten to be more scalable in the tracking of grace periods, but the current code is... a bit impenetrable. How true is the above guarantee these days?<br>

Dropped packets are a fact of life in networking; there can be any number
of reasons why a packet may not survive the journey to its destination.
Indeed, there are so many ways that a packet can meet its demise that it
can be hard for an administrator to tell why packets are being dropped.
That, in turn, can make life difficult in times when users are complaining
about high packet-loss rates.  Starting with 5.17, the kernel is getting
some improved instrumentation that should shed some light on why the kernel
decides to route packets into the bit bucket.
<p>
This problem is not new, and neither are attempts to address it.  The
kernel currently contains a "drop_monitor" functionality that was
introduced in the 2.6.30 kernel back in 2009.  Over the years, it has
gained some functionality but has managed to remain thoroughly and
diligently undocumented.  This feature appears to support a netlink API
that can deliver notifications when packets are dropped.  Those
notifications include an address within the kernel showing where the
decision to drop the packet was made, and can optionally include the 
dropped packets themselves.  User-space code can turn the addresses
into function names; desperate administrators can then dig through the
kernel source to try to figure out what is going on.
<p>
It seems like there should be a better way.  As it happens, the beginning
of the infrastructure to provide that better way was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c504e5c2f964">contributed to 5.17</a> by
Menglong Dong.  The internal kernel function that frees the memory holding
a packet is <tt>kfree_skb()</tt>; in 5.17, that function has become:
<p>
<pre>
    void kfree_skb_reason(struct sk_buff *skb, enum skb_drop_reason reason);
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>reason</tt> argument is new; it is intended to say <i>why</i> the
packet passed as <tt>skb</tt> has reached the end of the line.  This
information is not actually useful to the kernel, but it has been
added to the existing <tt>kfree_skb</tt> tracepoint, making it available to
any program that connects to that tracepoint.  Analysis scripts can quickly
print out why packets are being dropped; administrators can also attach BPF
programs to, for example, create a histogram of reasons for dropped
packets.
<p>
A new version of <tt>kfree_skb()</tt> has also been added; it simply calls
<tt>kfree_skb_reason()</tt> with "unspecified" as the reason.
<p>
In 5.17, the use of this infrastructure is relatively limited.  There are a few
TCP-level drop locations that have been instrumented with the new call, including
code that drops packets for being smaller than the TCP header size, not
being associated with an existing TCP socket, exhibiting checksum failures,
or having been explicitly dropped by an add-on socket filter program.  The
UDP subsystem has also been enhanced to note those same reasons for dropped
packets.
<p>
The situation is set to improve considerably in 5.18; patches already in
linux-next add a number of new reasons.  These document packets dropped by the
netfilter subsystem, that contain IP-header errors, or have been identified as a
spoofed packet by the reverse-path filter (rp_filter) mechanism.
Administrators will be able to see IP packets that have been dropped due to
an unsupported higher-level protocol.  Reasons have also been added for
UDP packets dropped by the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-xfrm.8.html">IPSec XFRM</a>
policy or a lack of memory within the kernel.
<p>
There is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220220070637.162720-1-imagedong@tencent.com/">yet
another set</a> of reason annotations that has been accepted, but which has
not yet found its way into linux-next; chances are that these will show up
in 5.18 as well.  They extend the XFRM-policy annotation to TCP, note
packets dropped due to missing or incorrect <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2385">MD5 hashes</a> (which
are evidently still a thing in 2022), as well as those containing invalid
TCP flags or sequence 
numbers outside of the current TCP window.  These patches also add new
instances of the other reasons noted above; some situations can be detected
in multiple places.
<p>
While the above set of reasons may seem long, this work could be seen as
having just begun.  In current linux-next, there are over 2,700 calls to
<tt>kfree_skb()</tt>, compared to 18&nbsp;to <tt>kfree_skb_reason()</tt>.
That suggests that a lot of packets will still be dropped for unspecified
reasons.  Still, this work represents a useful step forward, one that
should make many of the reasons for packet loss more readily available to
system administrators.
<p>
The part that remains missing, of course, is the user-space side.  The
current reason codes are all <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.17-rc5/source/include/linux/skbuff.h#L310">defined
in <tt>&lt;linux/skbuff.h&gt;</tt></a>, which is not part of the externally
available kernel API.  Moving them to a separate file under the
<tt>uapi</tt> directory would make them more accessible to developers.
Also helpful, of course, would be to have some documentation for this
mechanism and how to use it (and interpret the results), but even your
editor, often cited for naive optimism, will not be holding his breath for
that to show up.
<p>
Meanwhile, though, an important piece of the kernel's network functionality
is becoming a little more transparent to users.  That should make life
easier for system administrators who will be able to spend less time trying
to figure out why packets aren't making it through the system.
Unfortunately, though, this work offers no help for users who are wondering
why their packets are disappearing somewhere in the far reaches of the
Internet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Has this been considered for other things too?

Check out commit 2d4bc93368f5a (&quot;netlink: extended ACK reporting&quot;) which added the bare minimum infrastructure a long time ago, and you can find many users of NL_SET_ERR_MSG/GENL_SET_ERR_MSG (and similar macros) these days.<br>
<p>
It supports reporting a string (error message), a pointer  to a bad attribute, and if NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR_POL was used (which it is in the general policy-based parsing) will even return the policy for the attribute back to userspace to explain why the attribute failed (e.g. if it&#x27;s NLA_RANGE(U32, 1,2) and you gave a value 3).<br>

      There is a need for a facility to locate at run time <b>every</b> failed subroutine call.  The source code be edited with <tt>sed</tt> so that <tt>return -Exxxxx;</tt> becomes <tt>return ErrorCode(Exxxxx);</tt> with a default macro definiton something like
<pre>
     #ifndef ErrorCode
     #define ErrorCode(errnum) -(errnum)
     #endif
</pre>
Then the determined investigator can re-compile selected source files with something like
<pre>
     #define ErrorCode(errnum) myErrorDiagnostic(errnum, __builtin_return_address(0), __FUNCTION__, __LINE__)
</pre>
and supply a definition for the added subroutine <tt>myErrorDiagnostic</tt>.  Of course there are a handful of cases where error numbers are variables or the syntax is complex, and also a few places where simple automated editing fails.  Rate limiting the reporting can be a problem.  But I did this once, and got the answer I wanted.

      In most files you can even just

#define EINVAL ({printk(...); 22;})

Assuredly knowing when packets are dropped because NAPI polling isn&#x27;t keeping up with what&#x27;s incoming would be valuable.   Yeah, I&#x27;m sure that patches and test data would be welcome.<br>

In order to see packets dropping because CPU can&#x27;t keep up you have to look at the hardware statistics.<br>
This is reported in rx_missed. Not sure if there more that HW can tell you.<br>
There are lots of rx_dropped places in drivers, these could/should be instrumented.<br>

Md5 for TCP is really a single good protection against RST attacks on BGP. You can filter ingress, but there always is a risk to miss something. Having MD allow to have month-long tcp session without risks of malicious rst.<br>

eh, most uses of tcp md5 are pretty pointless because they just use well known passwords...<br>

I do understand you. When a new session is agreed with a party, a password is provided together with IP and AS number. Even md5 is considered hopelessly broken, for the sake of RST protection it is more than enough, because even 32 additional bits pushes attack from `feasible` to `unfeasible` realm.<br>

Even using a silly MD5 password is worthwhile, since the spray of failed MD5 packets (and thus log messages) prior to the BGP connection reset make it plain that the cause is network abuse. <br>
Cynically, if the BGP connection isn&#x27;t using a long, random, unique key prior to that outage, then it will be afterwards :-)<br>
<p>
Linux counting failed MD5 packets is excellent, as network operators investigating BGP connection issues can check that the counter is the expected zero.<br>
<p>
For the longest time vendors were promoting IPsec as the replacement for the TCP MD5 option, but operationally the overhead of configuration and customer education was too high. More recently TCP-AO (Authentication Option) offers a similar mechanism to the MD5 option, but with modern cyrptographic algorithms.<br>
<p>
For external BGP connections the TTL security check also offers good protection from network abuse. Customers generally seem to be able to configure that without much difficulty.<br>

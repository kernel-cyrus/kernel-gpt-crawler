<h1>Virtual Memory II: the return of objrmap</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 10, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>

<div class="ArticleText">
Andrea Arcangeli not only wants to make the Linux kernel scale to and
beyond 32GB of memory on 32-bit processors; he seems to be in a real
hurry.  There are, it would seem, customers waiting for a 2.6-based
distribution which can run in such environments.
<p>
For Andrea, the real culprit in the exhaustion of low memory is clear: it's
the reverse-mapping virtual memory ("rmap") code.  The rmap code was first
described on this page <a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0124/kernel.php3">in
January, 2002</a>; its purpose is to make it easier for the kernel to free
memory when swapping is required.  To that end, rmap maintains, for each
physical page in the system, a chain of reverse pointers; each pointer
indicates a page table which has a reference for that page.  By following
the rmap chains, the kernel can quickly find all mappings for a given page,
unmap them, and swap the page out.
<p>
The rmap code solved some real performance problems in the kernel's virtual
memory subsystem, but it, too has a cost.  Every one of those reverse
mapping entries consumes memory - low memory in particular.  Much effort has gone into
reducing the memory cost of the rmap chains, but the simple fact remains:
as the amount of memory (and the number of processes using that memory)
goes up, the rmap chains will consume larger amounts of low memory.
Eliminating the rmap overhead would go a long way toward allowing the
kernel to scale to larger systems.  Of course, one wants to eliminate this
overhead while not losing the benefits that rmap brings.
<p>

Andrea's approach is to bring back and extend the object-based reverse
mapping patches.  The initial object-based patch was created by Dave
McCracken; LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/23732/">covered this
patch</a> a year ago.  Essentially, this patch eliminates the rmap chains
for memory which maps a file by following pointers "the long way around"
and searching candidate virtual memory areas (VMAs).  Andrea has <a
href="/Articles/74812/">updated this patch</a> and fixed some bugs, but the
core of the patch remains the same; see last year's description for the
details. 
<p>
<a href="/Articles/73100/">Last week</a>, we raised the possibility that
the virtual memory subsystem could see fundamental changes in the course of
the 2.6 "stable" series.  This week, Linus <a
href="/Articles/75217/">confirmed that possibility</a> in response to
Andrea's object-based reverse mapping patch:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I certainly prefer this to the 4:4 horrors. So it sounds worth it
	to put it into -mm if everybody else is ok with it.
</div>
<p>
Assuming this work goes forward, it has the usual implications for the
stable kernel.  Even assuming that it stays in the -mm tree for some time,
its inclusion into 2.6 is likely to destabilize things for a few releases
until all of the obscure bugs are shaken out.
<p>
Dave McCracken's original patch, in any case, only solves part of the
problem.  It gets rid of the rmap chains for file-backed memory, but it
does nothing for anonymous memory (basic process data - stacks, memory
obtained with <tt>malloc()</tt>, etc.), which has no "object" behind it.
File-backed memory is a large portion of the total, especially on systems
which are running large Oracle servers and use big, shared file mappings.
But anonymous memory is also a large part of the mix; it would be nice to
take care of the rmap overhead for that as well.
<p>
To that end, Andrea has posted <a href="/Articles/75098/">another patch</a>
(in preliminary form) which provides object-based reverse mapping for
anonymous memory as well.  It works, essentially, by replacing the rmap
chain with a pointer to a chain of virtual memory area (VMA) structures.
<p>
Anonymous pages are always created in response to a request for memory from
a single process; as a result, they are never shared at creation time.
Given that, there is no need for a new anonymous page to have a chain of
reverse mappings; we know that there can be only a single mapping.  Andrea's
patch adds a union to <tt>struct page</tt> which includes the existing
<tt>mapping</tt> pointer (for non-anonymous memory) and adds a couple of
new ones.  One of those is simply called <tt>vma</tt>, and it points to the
(single) VMA structure pointing to the page.  So if a process has several 
non-shared, 
anonymous pages in the same virtual memory area, the structure looks
somewhat like
this: 
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/anonvma1.png" width=390 height=250 
 alt="[Anonymous reverse mapping]">
</center>
<p>
With this structure, the kernel can find the page table which maps a given
page by following the pointers through the VMA structure.
<p>
Life gets a bit more complicated when the process forks, however.  Once
that happens, there will be multiple page tables pointing to the same anonymous
pages and a single VMA pointer will no longer be adequate.  To deal with this
case, Andrea has created a new "<tt>anon_vma</tt>" structure which
implements a linked list of VMAs.  The third member of the new <tt>struct
page</tt> union is a pointer to this structure which, in turn, points to
all VMAs which might contain the page.  The structure now looks like:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/anonvma2.png" width=359 height=442 
 alt="[anonvma]">
</center>
<p>
If the kernel needs to unmap a page in this scenario, it must follow the
linked list and examine every VMA it finds.  Once the page is unmapped from
every page table found, it can be freed.
<p>

There are some memory costs to this scheme: the VMA structure requires a
new <tt>list_head</tt> structure, and the <tt>anon_vma</tt> structure must
be allocated whenever a chain must be formed.  One VMA can refer to
thousands of pages, however, so a per-VMA cost will be far less than the
per-page costs incurred by the existing rmap code.
<p>

This approach does incur a greater computational cost.  Freeing a page
requires scanning multiple VMAs which may or may not contain references to
the page under consideration.  This cost will increase with the number of
processes sharing a memory region.  Ingo Molnar, who is fond of O(1)
solutions, <a href="/Articles/75225/">is nervous</a> about object-based
schemes for this reason.  According to Ingo, losing the possibility of
creating an O(1) page unmapping scheme is a heavy cost to pay for the prize
of making large amounts of memory work on obsolete hardware.
<p>
The solution that Ingo would like to see, instead, is to reduce the
per-page memory overhead by reducing the number of pages.  The means to
that end is <a href="/Articles/23785/">page clustering</a> - grouping
adjacent hardware pages into larger virtual pages.  Page clustering would
reduce rmap overhead, and reduce the size of the main kernel memory map as
well.  The available page clustering patch is even more intrusive than
object-based reverse mapping, however; it seems seriously unlikely to be
considered for 2.6.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      There is some preview code available that would decrease the CPU overhead of objrmap, probably to acceptable levels. If that code works as well as it's supposed to work (it's a new data structure, not yet well tested, etc...) there's a reasonable chance the pte based rmap can be replaced.<p>It's good to see that the last reason that caused me to make the pte based rmap code is finally dissolving. A well working object based rmap is much lighter weight...

      <p>I guess even Linus sometimes bows to pressure.  After all, all this complication is quite unnecessary, it is a decade now that we've had 64 bits processors.  Nothing but Wintel FUD and proprietary software prevents users from running 64 bits now.

<p>It could be argued that 64 bits vendors haven't been doing the right thing.  Now Linus is on a POWER64 machine, but he should have been there for a long time, or on UltraSPARC.  A pity Intel killed the Alpha, which was once Linus' platform.  Also other developers should have been long ago given such systems.

<p>I hope the BSDs and the Hurd stick to sanity.

      Not sure what &quot;Intel killed the Alpha&quot; means. Alphas are available now (e.g., Compaq ES-47) and the Alpha technology is planned to be integrated into the Itanium product line starting in '06. Do you know something different?<br>

<p>Alpha ceased to be developed.

<blockquote>> <i>Alphas are available now (e.g., Compaq ES-47)</i></blockquote>

<p>Expensive, limited, substandard.  In other words, not developed neither as technology nor as a platform.

<blockquote>> <i>the Alpha technology is planned to be integrated into the Itanium</i></blockquote>

<p>Processor architecture is not like Lego where you can mix and match.  The Itanium and Alpha architectures are fundamentally different and philosophically opposed.  Some Alpha tricks may be incorporated into Itanium, but it will never see the potential Alpha had, and POWER still has but with a different focus.  Some argue that nothing has the potential Alpha had.

      Low memory on 32bit systems is <b>still</b> 2Gb! And if it's not enough for some structures on 32Gb system then obviously something is wrong: 10% for book-keeping is too much IMO (cache misses and all). So this patch <b>is</b> sane. True, only huge 32bit systems make it 2.6 and not 2.7 material but patch itself is sane - it's good for huge 64bit systems as well (not sure about small systems), just not essential there.

      Page clustering seems like the obvious solution. From one point of view, it is the 4K page size that is obsolete, not the 32-bit addressing. When can we anticipate having a page clustering option available?

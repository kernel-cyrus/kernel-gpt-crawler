           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 24, 2013</br>
           </div>
Tens of thousands of changes make their way into the mainline kernel every
year.  For most of those changes, the original motivation for the work is
quickly forgotten; all that remains is the code itself and the changelog
that goes with it.  For this reason, kernel maintainers tend to insist on
high-quality changelogs; as Linus recently <a href="/Articles/560393/">put
it</a>, "<q>We have a policy of good commit messages in the
kernel.</q>"  Andrew Morton also famously pushes developers to document
the reasons explaining why a patch was written, including the user-visible
effects of any bugs fixed.  Kernel developers do not like having to reverse
engineer the intent of a patch years after the fact.
<p>
With that context in mind, and having just worked through another merge
window's worth of patches, your editor started wondering if our changelogs
were always as good as they should be.  A bit of scripting later, a picture
of sorts has emerged; as one might expect, the results were not
always entirely encouraging.
<p>
<h4>Changelogs</h4>
<p>
A patch's changelog is divided into three parts: a one-line summary,
a detailed change explanation, and a tags section.  For the most
trivial patches, the one-line summary might suffice; there is not much
to add to "add missing include of foo.h", for example.  For anything else,
one would expect a bit more text describing what is going on.  So patches
with empty explanation sections should be relatively rare.
<p>
As of this writing, just under 70,000 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository since the release of the 3.5 kernel on
July&nbsp;21, 2012.  Of those, 6,306 had empty explanations — 9% of the
total.  Many of them were as trivial as one might expect, but others were
rather less so.
<p>
Some developers are rather more laconic than others.  In the period since
3.5, the developers most inclined to omit explanations were:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th>Developer</th><th>Count</th></tr>
	<tr class="Odd"><td>Al Viro</td><td align="right">570</td></tr>
	<tr class="Even"><td>Ben Skeggs</td><td align="right">224</td></tr>

</blockquote>
<p>
For the curious, <a href="/Articles/560397/">a page listing the
no-explanation patches merged by the above developers</a> is available.  A
quick look shows that a lot of patches with empty explanations find their way
into the core virtual filesystem layer; many of the rest affect graphics
drivers, audio drivers, Video4Linux drivers, and the DRBD subsystem.  But
they can be found anywhere; of the 1,065 changes that touched the
<tt>mm/</tt> subdirectory, 46 lacked an explanation, for example.
<p>
If one believes that there should be fewer patches with empty explanations
going into the kernel, one might be inclined to push subsystem maintainers
to be a bit more demanding in this regard.  But, interestingly, it has
become much harder to determine which maintainers have had a hand in
directing patches into the kernel.
<p>
<h4>Signoffs</h4>
<p>
The Signed-off-by line in the tags section is meant to document the
provenance of patches headed into the mainline.  When a developer submits a
patch, the changelog should contain a signoff certifying that the patch can properly
be contributed to the kernel under a GPL-compatible license.  Additionally,
maintainers who accept patches add their own signoffs documenting that they
handled the patch and that they believe it is appropriate for submission to
the mainline.  In theory, by following the sequence of Signed-off-by lines,
it is possible to determine the path that any change followed to get to
Linus's tree.
<p>
The truth is a little bit more complicated than that.  To begin with, of
the changes merged since 3.5, 79 had no signoffs at all.  Roughly half of
those were commits by Linus changing the version number; he does not apply
a signoff to such changes, even for <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ad81f0545ef01ea651886dddac4bef6cec930092">those
that contain added data</a> beyond the version number update.  The rest are
all almost certainly mistakes; a handful are the result of obvious
formatting errors.  See <a href="/Articles/560401/">the full
list</a> for details.  The mistakes are innocent, but they do show a
failure of a process which is supposed to disallow patches that have not
been signed off by their authors.
<p>
Arguably, there is another class of patches that is more interesting: those
that contain a single Signed-off-by line.  Such patches have, in theory,
been managed by a single developer who wrote the patch and got it into the
mainline unassisted.  One might think that only Linus is in a position to
do any such thing; how could anybody else get a change into the mainline on
their own?
<p>

In fact, of the 70,000 patches pulled into the mainline during the period
under discussion, 16,651 had a single signoff line.  Of those, 11,527 (16%
of the total) had no other tags, like Acked-by, Reviewed-by, or Tested-by,
that would indicate attention from at least one other developer.  For the
purposes of this discussion, only the smaller set of patches has been
considered.  The most frequent committers of single-signoff patches are:

<p>
(See <a href="/Articles/560404/">this page</a> for a list of the
single-signoff patches merged by the above developers).
These results are, of course, a result of the use of git combined with the
<a href="/Articles/328436/">no-rebasing rule</a>.  Once a patch has been
committed to a public repository, it becomes immutable and can never again
acquire tags like Signed-off-by.  To pick one example from the list above,
wireless developer Johannes Berg maintains his own tree for mac80211
changes; when he commits a patch, it will carry his signoff.  Changes flow
from that tree to John Linville's wireless tree, then to Dave Miller's
networking tree, and finally to the mainline repository.  Since each of
those moves is done with a Git "pull" operation, no additional signoffs
will be attached to any of those patches; they will arrive in the mainline
with a single signoff.
<p>

One might contend that patches become less subject to review once they
enter the Git stream; they can be pulled from one repository to the next
sight-unseen.
Indeed, early in the BitKeeper era, developers worried that pull requests
would be 
used to slip unreviewed patches into the mainline kernel.  Single-signoff
patches might be an indication that this is happening.  And, indeed,
important patches like <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=60545d0d4610b02e55f65d141c95b18ccf855b6e">the
addition of the <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> option</a> went to the mainline with, as
far as your editor can tell, no public posting or review (and no
explanation in the changelog, for that matter).  It also seems
plausible that single-signoff patches merged into the sound subsystem or
the Radeon driver (to name a couple of examples) have not been reviewed in
detail by anybody other than the author; there just aren't that many people
with the interest and skills to review that code.
<p>
Without a chain of signoff lines, we lose more than a picture of which
maintainers might have reviewed the patches; we also lose track of the path
by which 
a patch finds its way into the mainline.  A given changeset may pass
through a number of repositories, but those passages leave no mark on the
changeset itself.  Sometimes that path can be worked out from the mainline
repository history, but doing so can be harder than one might imagine, even
in the absence of "fast-forward merges" and other actions that obscure that
history.  Given that the Signed-off-by line was introduced to document how
patches get into the kernel, the loss of this information may be a reason
for concern.
<p>
The kernel community prides itself on its solid foundation of good
procedures, including complete changelogs and a reliable signoff chain.
Most of the time, that pride is entirely justified.  But, perhaps, there
might be room for improvement here and there — that is unsurprising when
one considers that no project that merges 70,000 changes in a year can be
expected to do a perfect job with every one of them.  Where there is
imperfection, there is room for improvement — though improving the signoff
chain will be difficult as long as the tools do not allow it.  But even a
bit more verbiage in commit messages would be appreciated by those of us
who read the patch stream.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

FWIW, I also maintain the iwlwifi tree(s) along with mac80211, which have a similar situation and that probably explains the relatively large number of commits. Not that I've tried to figure out how many come from where.<br>
<p>
Most of the time I (used to) post iwlwifi patches to the list for review along with the pull request, but there's no telling who looks at them. If anyone sends an explicit review/ack tag, I will add that (by way of rebasing my submission tree) unless it comes in after my tree was merged, but it's very rare in any case. I've stopped sending the patches for a while but should probably get back to it, I admit that I've been somewhat sloppy here.<br>
<p>
Also, for iwlwifi, we have an internal process that typically has at least two people to looking at a patch (usually myself and Emmanuel) but this is only reflected in Reviewed-by tags since there's no "handling" of the patch outside of my tree.<br>
<p>
For mac80211 (and cfg80211) this process would not really make sense. I think right now we're also lacking anyone committed to following mac80211/cfg80211 changes and wanting to familiarize themselves with the details; this is also dangerous in other ways, the bus factor is pretty small here. I suspect the same is, unfortunately, true in other subsystems as well.<br>

I think git is missing some metadata or "properties" concept. Another, somewhat related example where this would be useful:<br>

You can have, and show, multiple notes refs (collections of notes) at the same time. You can also merge changes to notes refs. What's really missing right now is a "good", predefined sharing scheme(*), and a good use-case.<br>
<p>
It seems like the kernel collecting further signoffs and similar tags could provide the latter. I can try to get the ball rolling, but it would help massively if a group of interested kernel devs would volunteer as guinea pigs :-) <br>
<p>
(*) you can share them by manually configuring push/fetch specs.<br>

<p>
As <code>git notes</code> are stored in a separate ref in the repo (which is what makes them not alter history in the first place), you also have to tag and sign the note ref separately if you want to trust any notes information.
</p>
<p>
No idea if faked signoff attempts are that big a problem though :)

I think one of the most important things in the history of a patch would be the email thread where it was discussed in public mailing lists.  They are usually very verbose and, especially in controversial cases, contain the details of the discussions that affected the final version.<br>
<p>
I very often find myself googling for the commit summary string as a way to figure out what has really led to the patch in question.<br>
<p>
Now, how that could be incorporated in the commit log beats me.<br>

In drm/i915 I simply demand that review needs to be reflected in the commit, no matter what. So either the patch gets updated or the commit message needs improvement since if it would have been perfect no questions would have popped up in review.<br>
<p>
For similar reasons I also insist that the revision log of individual patches is kept as part of the commit message (and not hidden below the -- line). We also use a bit more elaborate commit message citation layout (essentially git show up to the patch headline) so that author, committer, sha1 and headline is all there at a glance.<br>
<p>
It's a lot more work than onleliners but imo enforcing high standars for commit messages is really worth it when digging through history.<br>

The scripts I use extract the message id from the email from a patch that is sent to me and its automatically added to the change log. They look like this:<br>
<p>
  Link: <a href="http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20130718184712.GA4786@redhat.com">http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20130718184712.GA4786@redhat.com</a><br>
<p>
That maps to marc.info/?i=20130718184712.GA4786@redhat.com which is the email of the patch. Usually from that, you can get the thread, which *is* very useful. I just used it a few minutes ago to figure out why some function was called in the MIPS code.<br>

This. Message-IDs are very important, and it's good that some public archives support search by msgid. For example, the URL format for gmane is<br>
<p>
<a href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=20130718184712.GA4786@redhat.com">http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=2013071818...</a><br>
<p>
A further improvement is storing the original subject (including the "bag of tags" part) of the patch email (if the patch was posted to and applied from a list) as a "pseudo header". This helps identifying a series using just the git commit log (due to the patch numbering being captured).<br>
<p>
What I miss is some way to save cover letters as standalone, no-code-change commits.<br>

You could have the entire patch series as a temporary (topic) branch, and the cover letter as the [empty] merge commit log message, and you can do that right now.<br>
<p>
This works well only when the patch stack is going in through the same tree, obviously.<br>
<p>
As for notes, their out-of-band nature will complicate a secure workflow somewhat, but it should be possible to do it.<br>

Ah, this looks good.  I've been using the "find message ID" kind of thing when referencing email discussions, but it never occurred to me to include it in the tags section of the commit log.<br>
<p>
But I think it would be better if this became more standard.  Maybe if git itself would save the message ID so it could be easily looked up.<br>
<p>
What we're missing here is a way to make it possible to find email discussions by looking at *any* commit in the git log.  If there is a commit for which the message ID cannot be found in any public mailing lists, that would be a red flag telling us that the commit was not reviewed publicly.<br>

I do the same thing but I do it in the form of a Message-id: tag.  That way you don't have to worry about links breaking over time.<br>
<p>
Here's an example:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fd1d9926e91f421bc851f9dd19875f14799c6e4b">http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fd1d9926e91f42...</a><br>

Besides being a good way to associate a commit with a mail thread, it is useful for generating automatic "Thank you" notes when a patch is applied.<br>

We use to use LKML-Reference: tags that just included the message-id, but Linus hated it:<br>

<p>
 Link: <a href="http://lkml.kernel.org/r/&lt;message-id">http://lkml.kernel.org/r/&lt;message-id</a>&gt;<br>

That way we have a link to the message that you can easily find, and if you are worried about that link disappearing, you have the message-id in the link. The best of both worlds.<br>

A message-id is infinitely more useful than a link.  There is no programmatic way of getting a message-id from a link so you can't generate email responses without it.<br>

There are also times when you make trivial patches that the subject line is all you need to describe the change.<br>
<p>
I respectfully suggest your measurement and conclusions are in error.<br>
<p>
You did not measure if the what was written actually describes what is going on, and without actually looking to see if the subject is sufficient explanation it is quite insulting to call some of these patches no explanation patches.<br>
<p>
You seem to be encouraging people to make larger harder to bisect and harder to read patches simply to get get patches that need more explanation.  Something I expect would be much worse.<br>

A huge number of Al's changes, for one, are just a result of splitting up interface changes to the VFS per-filesystem. There's really not much to say about all the changes after the one that makes the actual VFS changes (though a link back to the SHA-1 ID of that in each filesystem-specific change might be good).<br>

      "No-explanation" means no text in the explanation area; I'm sorry if that wasn't clear.
<p>
The article <i>does</i> say that, for some patches, a one-line summary is sufficient.
<p>
I'm confused by the comment on readability; the point of the explanation area is to make the patch easier to understand, after all.  I didn't suggest populating it from your spam folder.  And I'll confess to being totally thrown by the mention of bisectability - how on earth is that affected by changelog contents?

I think the implication was that people ought to keep piling things into a single commit until that commit is complicated enough to justify a full explanation.<br>
<p>
Having said that, I read the article and understood it the way you intended. (And I think most developers would have no problem recalling examples of commits where one line is sufficient, even if you had not pointed it out.)<br>

      <p>Or to put it another way: if someone takes a complicated change, carefully splits it into small independent steps, and leaves the explanation on the first commit--then they get dinged for writing inadequate commit messages?

<p>Often the reason Al's patches lack changelog bodies is because he does the hard work of figuring out how to get from point A to point B in trivial self-explanatory steps--something he deserves credit for.  (What *does* get lost, I think, is motivation: for example, motivation for the readdir api change ("dealing with -&gt;f_pos races in -&gt;readdir() instances for good") is only in the cover letter, as far as I can tell, not in any changelog or code comment (but I may have missed it, or maybe it's there in changes to problematic filesystems, I didn't check).)

<p>In any case, I don't think we can draw useful conclusions from simple summaries of the commit statistics--careful examination of representative cases would seem more instructive.

The chain of Signed-off-by is there just not in the expected way provided that maintainers 1) set no-ff and 2) add a Signed-off-by to the merge commit.<br>
<p>
If you do that (and we do in QEMU) then you can walk the full history.<br>
<p>
The practical problem with Reviewed-by/Tested-by is it's a pain in the ass to add them as a maintainer.  I have some scripts to do this given an mbox and have been planning to generalize but haven't gotten around to it.  I suspect a few other people have similar scripts floating around.<br>

"One might contend that patches become less subject to review once they enter the Git stream."<br>
<p>
Hopefully everything went to a list as well.  I don't think anything gets reviewed again when it hits git.  I know I review everything on the staging mailing list, but I never review git patches.<br>
<p>
Maintainers often don't apply patches when the merge window is open so there is sometimes a delay before the patch gets reviewed and applied.  But for bystanders, if no one comments on the patch within 3 days then there probably won't be any comments.  In other words, if I don't comment on the patch after three days, that means I have Ack-ed it.<br>

You mention Linus not adding sign-offs to patches that he applies himself.<br>

What would be the purpose of such a thing.  So that Linus would know that he had claimed the legal authority to post the patch that he just wrote? It all seems a bit self-referential and involves too much of Linus talking to himself.<br>

      I'm confused by this comment.  Linus <i>does</i> sign off patches that he writes, or that he applies directly (not via a pull).  And that makes sense; the purpose of a signoff isn't just for Linus to know, it's for the world to know who took responsibility for the patch.  What he doesn't assign is version number updates.  
<p>
 What am I missing here?

The world should be able to see "Author: Linus Torvalds" ... and not need anything else for patches that Linus applies himself (Things are a bit different when Linus writes a patch and then asks a sub-maintainer to apply it ... then there is some value in the Signed-off-by chain).<br>
<p>
You called out specifically changes to version that add other data (pointing to the Linux for Workgroups logo).  Would this really have been better if it had a "Signed-off-by:" line?<br>

      Again, Linus seems to think differently; he follows the same rules as everybody else for anything but version number tweaks.  I think this makes sense; there's lots of kernel repositories, only one controlled by Linus.  Adding an implicit "no signoff means signed-off-by: Linus" rule for all of them strikes me  as inconsistent and weird.
<p>
As for whether he signs off on a version number change, it doesn't matter that much.  I was just describing the data for the curious.

Yes, reverts need a Signed-off-by.  git-revert even has a -s option for it.<br>
<p>
A revert is not the same thing as making the commit never exist.  Often they do not apply cleanly and it's very hard for a reviewer to know whether the author of the revert had to apply logic to resolve conflicts.<br>

It would be useful if revert commits looked like (or simply were) merges. I sometimes do it by hand, but that's awkward.<br>

Please allow me to disagree with this:<br>
<p>
  Without a chain of signoff lines, we lose more than a picture of which maintainers might have reviewed the patches; we also lose track of the path by which a patch finds its way into the mainline.<br>
<p>
Given a commit hash you can always do<br>
<p>
$ git log --ancestry-path --merges &lt;commit&gt;..HEAD<br>
<p>
go to the bottom of the log and see whose hands the commit has gone through.<br>

      Interesting, I just tried that with randomly chosen commit b4419e1a15905191661ffe75ba2f9e649f5d565e (a GPIO fix) and found that it listed the thermal and tracing trees, which are unlikely to have hosted that patch.  --ancestry-path prints all intervening commits, so there's a lot of extra noise, while, of course, any fast-forward merges will be missing.  A useful tool but not a definitive answer.

      I'd suggest that was a poor example as it was merged directly by Linus, so there is only one interesting merge.
<p>
fast-forward merges are certain to cause problems, and we should probably dictate that maintainers *must*not*do*that* (--no-ff please!)(they probably already do?).  Assuming a lack for fast-forward patches, "git name-rev" can help.
<p>
e.g.
<pre>
$ git name-rev 453807f3006757a5661c4000262d7d9284b5214c
453807f3006757a5661c4000262d7d9284b5214c tags/v3.10-rc1~14^2~20^2~3^2~29
</pre>

Then apply the following (which can obviously be scripted):
<pre>
% git log -n1 --format=short tags/v3.10-rc1~14^2~20^2~3^2~29
commit 453807f3006757a5661c4000262d7d9284b5214c
Author: Lars-Peter Clausen &lt;lars@metafoo.de&gt;

    ASoC: ep93xx: Use ep93xx_dma_params instead of ep93xx_pcm_dma_params
% git log -n1 --format=short tags/v3.10-rc1~14^2~20^2~3

commit 05a88a43604abb816dfbff075bb114224641793b
Merge: daf799c 6c35ae3
Author: Linus Torvalds &lt;torvalds@linux-foundation.org&gt;

    Merge tag 'sound-3.10' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound
</pre>

and you have the merge commits that merged the patch into the trunk and the people responsible.

(interesting commits to experiment with can be found via
<pre>
git log | git name-rev --stdin | grep '~.*~.*~.*~.*~'
</pre>
with varying numbers of '~' in the 'grep')

Does setting the noff option in gitconfig still force pull-merges without pull.rebase to true? Merges with --no-ff are great, but pull merges are really quite a bit worse, IMO. (I don't care how often you pull from a remote, just don't modify the tree when you do it). Also, it means that if there are conflicts, they happen when merging a remote into your branch which is backwards since your branch is topologically older.<br>

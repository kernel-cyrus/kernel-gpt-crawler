</div>
Compressed memory — the use of compression to compact memory contents in
RAM as an alternative to swapping those contents to disk — has been the
subject of extensive discussion on the kernel mailing lists.  In
particular, there has been a lot of debate over the relative merits of two
approaches, known as zswap and zcache.  Zswap developer Seth Jennings and
zcache hacker Dan Magenheimer came to LSFMM 2013 in an attempt to reach an
agreement on the way forward; an attempt that appears to have been
successful.
<p>
Seth started by presenting compressed swap and the problems that it is
trying to solve.  Readers who are not familiar with this concept may want
to read <a href="/Articles/537422/">Seth's zswap article</a> and  <a
href="/Articles/545244/">this article by Dan</a> for the 
relevant background information.
<p>
Andrew Morton noted that the whole thing makes his head spin.  From there, the
discussion quickly honed in on one of the more contentious sub-issues
related to in-kernel memory compression: the need for a special-purpose
memory allocator.  There is a widespread sentiment among memory management
developers that we have plenty of allocators already; adding another would
increase maintenance costs significantly.  In this case, though, there
seems to be a legitimate need; in a sense, the "memory allocator" under
discussion here is more of a bin-packing system that stores compressed
pages of memory.  The slab allocators are very good at packing fixed-size
allocations, but compressed pages vary widely in size, so the existing
allocators do not work for in-kernel compression.
<p>
Agreement on the need for a new allocator is not the same as agreement on
<i>which</i> allocator should be used, though.  Zswap uses "zsmalloc,"
which uses some clever schemes to pack compressed pages efficiently.  That
efficiency comes at a cost, though: freeing a page used by zsmalloc is
difficult; it can require pushing an unknown number of pages out to the
real swap device and an unknown amount of time.  The "zbud" allocator used
with zcache, instead, is inefficient: it can only pack two compressed
pages into a physical page, but the cost of freeing that physical page is
small and known ahead of time.
<p>
Hugh Dickins questioned the design of zbud, observing that it was strange
to design that kind of limitation into the system from the start.  But Mel
Gorman came out strongly in favor of zbud despite its "awful packing
properties."  He sees the unpredictability at the heart of zsmalloc as a
long-term source of bugs and strange memory management behavior.  What he
would really like, he said, would be a modular interface to the allocation
layer so that different solutions could be used at different sites.
<p>
From there the developers worked toward a consensus on how to handle the
conflict between these two projects.  There was some concern raised about
the complexity of zcache, though the extra features provided by that
complexity (primarily the ability to store compressed page cache pages)
were appreciated.  One of the data structures used by zcache was described
in the session as "a table of hash tables of red-black trees of radix
trees."  So it is not surprising that the relative simplicity of zswap
looked appealing.  As Mel put it, if zswap cannot be made to work well,
zcache is hopeless, so perhaps the best course is to start with zswap,
possibly with a modular allocator interface.
<p>
Hugh added that compression of page cache (file) pages  may be
appealing, but the filesystem developers do not seem to be that interested
in zcache in general.  So he agreed that it might make better sense to
start with zswap, perhaps adding zcache features over time.  Dan said that
he would agree to merging zswap as long as there was an explicit
understanding that zswap is not the end of development in this area; there
is, he said, a lot more work to be done to gain the full benefits of
in-kernel compression.  In other words, he would plan to submit patches to
increase the functionality of zswap over time.
<p>
There was further discussion on various details, including writeback (the
process by which compressed pages are uncompressed and written to the
"real" swap device).  Zswap does it in the zsmalloc allocator, which is
seen as being the wrong place; the separate thread used by zcache looked
better to some developers and was suggested as being a good first feature
to port over to zswap.  Hugh complained that writeback decisions should be
made at a higher level altogether, though.
<p>
Michel Lespinasse said that zswap, using the zsmalloc allocator, would work
well in Google.  They don't run with "real" swap at all, so the problematic
writeback behavior associated with zsmalloc would not be experienced
there.  Zswap is not designed to run in this mode — it expects there to be
a swap device to use as a backing store — but Mel suggested creating a fake
swap device that would fail all requests as a possible solution there.
<p>
In the end, it appears that there is a consensus for merging zswap as the
next step for in-kernel compression.  Mel noted that he would block the
merging, though, if it didn't have a modular allocation layer.  Leaving
modularization for later would not work, he said; that work would never be
done and he'd have to deal with the bug reports a couple of years down the
line.  So the allocation layer in zswap will need some work; after that, we
will likely see a submission for mainline merging.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

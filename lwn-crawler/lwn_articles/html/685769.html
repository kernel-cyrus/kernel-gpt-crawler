<h1>In pursuit of faster futexes</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="GAByline">
           <p>May 4, 2016</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex">Futexes</a>, the
primitives provided by Linux for fast user-space <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion">mutex</a> support,
have been 
explored many times in these pages.  They have gained various improvements
over the years such as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/178253/">priority
inheritance</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/172149/">robustness</a> in the face of
processes dying.  But it appears that there is still at least one thing
they lack: a recent <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/682277/">patch
set</a> from Thomas Gleixner, along with a <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/685425/">revised version</a>, aims to
correct the unfortunate fact that they just aren't fast enough.</p>

<p>The claim that futexes are fast (as advertised by the "f" in
the name) is primarily based on their
behavior when there is no contention on any specific futex.  Claiming a futex
that no other task holds, or releasing a futex that no other task
wants, is extremely quick; the entire operation happens
in user space with no involvement from the kernel.  The claims that
futexes are not fast <i>enough</i>, instead, focus on the contended case:
waiting for a busy lock, or sending a wakeup while releasing a lock that
others are waiting for.  These operations must involve calls into the
kernel as sleep/wakeup events and communication between different tasks are
involved.  It is 
expected that this case won't be as fast as the uncontended case, but hoped
that it can be faster than it is, and particularly that the
delays caused can be more predictable.  The source of the delays has
to do with shared state managed by the kernel.</p>

<h4>Futex state: not everything is a file (descriptor)</h4>

<p>Traditionally in Unix, most of the state owned by a process is
represented by file descriptors, with memory mappings being the main
exception.  Uniformly using file descriptors provides a number of
benefits: the  kernel can find the state using a simple <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/fdtable.h?id=b562e44f507e863c6792946e4e1b1449fbbac85d#n76">array lookup</a>,
the file descriptor limit stops processes from inappropriately
overusing memory, state can easily be released with a simple
<tt>close()</tt>, and everything can be cleaned up nicely when the process
exits.</p>

<p>Futexes do not make use of file descriptors (for general state
management) so none of these benefits apply.  They use such a tiny
amount of kernel space, and then only transiently, that it could be
argued that the lack of file descriptors is not a problem.  Or at least it
could until the discussion around
Gleixner's first patch set, where exactly 
this set of benefits was found to be wanting.
While this first attempt has since been
discarded in favor of a much simpler approach, exploring it further
serves to highlight the key issues and shows what a complete solution
might look like.</p>

<p>If we leave priority inheritance out of the picture for simplicity,
there are two data structures that the kernel uses to support
futexes. <tt>struct futex_q</tt> is used to represent a task that is
waiting on a futex.  There is at most one of these for each task and
it is only needed while the task is waiting in the
<tt>futex(FUTEX_WAIT)</tt> system call, so it is easily allocated on the
stack.  This piece of kernel state doesn't require any extra
management.</p>

<p>The second data structure is a fixed sized hash table comprising an
array of <tt>struct futex_hash_bucket</tt>; it looks something like this:</p>


<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/futex-current.png" alt="Futex data structures"
    width="364" height=439>
</blockquote>

<p>Each bucket has a linked list of <tt>futex_q</tt> structures representing
waiting tasks together with a spinlock and some accounting to manage
that list.  When a <tt>FUTEX_WAIT</tt> or <tt>FUTEX_WAKE</tt> request
is made, the
address of the futex in question is hashed and the resulting number is used to
choose a bucket in the hash table, either to attach the waiting task
or to find tasks to wake up.</p>

<p>The performance issues arise when accessing this hash table, and they
are issues that would not affect access in a file-descriptor model.
First, the &quot;address&quot; of a futex can, in the general case, be either an
offset in memory or an offset in a file and, to ensure that the correct
calculation is made, the fairly busy <tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore
must be claimed.  A more significant motivation for the current patches is
that a single
bucket can be shared by multiple futexes.  This makes the process of
walking the linked list of <tt>futex_q</tt> structures to find tasks to wake
up non-deterministic since the length could vary depending on the
extent of sharing.  For realtime workloads determinism is important;
those loads would benefit from the hash buckets not being shared.</p>

<p>The single hash table causes a different sort of performance problem
that affects NUMA machines.  Due to their non-uniform memory
architecture, some memory is much faster to access than other memory.
Linux normally allocates memory resources needed by a task from the
memory that is closest to the CPU that the task is running on, so as
to make use of the faster access.  Since the hash table is all at one
location, the memory will probably be slow for most tasks.</p>

<p>Gleixner, the realtime tree maintainer, reported that these problems
can be measured and that in real world applications the hash
collisions "<q>cause performance or determinism issues</q>".
This is not a particularly new observation: Darren Hart <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/360699/">reported</a> in
a summary of the state of futexes in 2009 that "<q>the futex hash
table is shared across all processes and is protected by spinlocks
which can lead to real overhead, especially on large systems.</q>"
What does seem to be new is that Gleixner has a proposal to fix the
problems.</p>

<h4>Buckets get allocated instead of shared</h4>

<p>The core of Gleixner's initial proposal was to replace use of the
global table of buckets, shared by all futexes, with dynamically
allocated buckets — one for each futex.  This was an opt-in change: a
task needed to explicitly request an attached futex to get one that
has its own private bucket in which waiting tasks are queued.</p>

<p>If we return to the file descriptor model mentioned earlier, kernel
state is usually attached via some system call like <tt>open()</tt>,
<tt>socket()</tt>, or <tt>pipe()</tt>.  These calls create a data structure — a
<tt>struct file</tt> — and return a file descriptor, private to the
process, that 
can be used to access it.  Often there will be a common namespace so
that two processes can access the same thing: a shared inode might
be found by name and referenced by two private files each accessed
through file descriptors.</p>

<p>Each of these ideas are present in Gleixner's implementation, though
with different names.  In place of a file descriptor there is the
task-local address of the <tt>futex</tt> that is purely a memory address,
never a file offset. It is hashed for use as a key to a new per-task hash
table — the <tt>futex_cache</tt>.  In place of the <tt>struct file</tt>,
the hash table has a <tt>futex_cache_slot</tt> that contains information
about the futex.  Unlike most hash tables in the kernel, this one
doesn't allow chaining: if a potential collision is ever detected the
size of the hash table is doubled.</p>

<p>In place of the shared inode, attached futexes have a shared
<tt>futex_state</tt> structure that contains the global bucket for that
futex.  Finally, to serve as a namespace, the existing global hash table
is used.  Each <tt>futex_state</tt> contains a <tt>futex_q</tt> that can be linked
into that table.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
  <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/futex-attached.png" alt="New Futex data
  structures" width=437 height=538/>
</blockquote>


<p>With this infrastructure in place, a task that wants to work with an
attached futex must first attach it:</p>
<pre>
    sys_futex(FUTEX_ATTACH | FUTEX_ATTACHED, uaddr, ....);
</pre>
<p>and can later detach it:</p>
<pre>
    sys_futex(FUTEX_DETACH | FUTEX_ATTACHED, uaddr, ....);
</pre>

<p>All operations on the attached futex would include the
<tt>FUTEX_ATTACHED</tt> flag to make it clear they expect an attached futex,
rather than a normal on-demand futex.</p>

<p>The <tt>FUTEX_ATTACH</tt> behaves a little like
<tt>open()</tt> and finds or creates a
<tt>futex_state</tt> by performing a lookup in the global hash
table, and then attaches it to the task-local
<tt>futex_cache</tt>.  All future accesses to that futex will
find the <tt>futex_state</tt> with a lookup in the
<tt>futex_cache</tt> which will be a constant-time lockless
access to memory that is probably on the same NUMA node as the task.  There
is every reason to expect that this would be faster and Gleixner has some
numbers to prove it, though he admitted they were a synthetic benchmark
rather than a real-world load.</p>

<h4>It's always about the interface</h4>

<p>The main criticisms that Gleixner's approach received were not that he
was re-inventing the file-descriptor model, but that he was changing
the interface at all.</p>

<p>Having these faster futexes was not contentious.  Requiring, or even
allowing, the application programmer to choose between the old and the
new behavior is where the problem lies.  Linus Torvalds in particular
<a href="/Articles/682771/">didn't think</a> that programmers would make
the right choice, primarily 
because they wouldn't have the required perspective or the necessary
information to make an informed choice.  The tradeoffs are really
at the system level rather than the application level: large memory systems,
particularly NUMA systems, and those designed to support realtime loads
would be 
expected to benefit.  Smaller systems or those with no realtime
demands are unlikely to notice and could suffer from the extra memory
allocations.  So while a system-wide configuration might be suitable,
a per-futex configuration would not.  This seems to mean that futexes
would need to automatically attach without requiring an explicit
request from the task.</p>

<p>Torvald Riegel <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/1459842272.1991.34.camel@localhost.localdomain">supported</a> this conclusion from the different
perspective provided by glibc.  When using futexes to implement, for
example, C11 mutexes, "<q>there's no good place to add the
attach/detach calls</q>" and no way to deduce whether it is worth
attaching at all.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the new <tt>FUTEX_ATTACH</tt> interface makes the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/412131/">mistake of conflating</a> two different elements of functionality.  A
task that issues this request is both asking for the faster implementation
and agreeing to be involved in resource management, implicitly stating
that it will call <tt>FUTEX_DETACH</tt> when the futex is no longer needed.
Torvalds rejected the first of these as inappropriate and Riegel
challenged the second as being hard to work with in practice.  This
effectively rang the death knell for explicit attachment.</p>

<h4>Automatic attachment</h4>

<p>Gleixner had already considered automatic attachment but had rejected it
because of problems with, to use his list:</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<pre>
     - Memory consumption
     - Life time issues
     - Performance issues due to the necessary allocations
</pre>
</div>

<p>Starting with the lifetime issues, it is fairly clear that the lifetime
of the <tt>futex_state</tt> and <tt>futex_cache_slot</tt> structures would 
start when a thread needed to wake or wait on a futex.  When the lifetime
ends is the interesting question and, while it wasn't discussed, 
there seem to be two credible options.  The easy option is for these
structures to remain until the thread(s) using them exits, or at least
until the memory containing the futex is unmapped.  This could be long
after the futex is no longer of interest, and so is wasteful.</p>

<p>The more conservative option would be to keep the structures on some
sort of LRU (least-recently used) list and discard the state for old
futexes when the total allocated seems too high.  As this would
introduce a new source of non-determinism in access speed, the
approach is likely a non-starter, so wastefulness is the only option.</p>

<p>This brings us to memory consumption.  Transitioning from the
current implementation to attached futexes changes the kernel memory
used per idle futex from zero to something non-zero.  This may not be
a small change.  It is easy to imagine an application embedding a
futex in every instance of some object that is allocated and
de-allocated in large numbers.  Every time such a futex suffers
contention, an extra in-kernel data structure would be created.  The
number of such would probably not grow quickly, but it could just keep
on growing.  This would particularly put pressure on the <tt>futex_cache</tt>
which could easily become too large to manage.</p>

<p>The performance issues due to extra allocations are not a problem with
explicit attachment for, as Gleixner later <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/alpine.DEB.2.11.1604031158110.3978@nanos">clarified</a>:
"<q>Attach/detach is not really critical.</q>" With implicit
attachment they would happen at first contention which would introduce
new non-determinism.  A realtime task working with automatically
attached futexes would probably avoid this by issuing some no-op
operation on a futex just to trigger the attachment at a predictable
time.</p>

<p>All of these problems effectively rule out implicit attachment,
meaning that, despite the fact that they remove nearly all the overhead
for futex accesses, attached futexes really don't have a future.</p>

<h4>Version two: no more attachment</h4>

<p>Gleixner did indeed determine that attachment has no future and came
up with an alternate scheme.  The last time that futex performance was
a problem, the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a52b89ebb6d4499be38780db8d176c5d3a6fbc17">response</a>
was to increase the size of the global hash 
table and enforce an alignment of buckets to cache lines to improve
SMP behavior.  Gleixner's latest patch set follows the same idea with a
bit more sophistication.  Rather than increase the single global hash
table a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_%28database_architecture%29">&quot;sharding&quot;</a> approach is taken, creating multiple distinct
hash tables for multiple distinct sets of futexes.</p>

<p>Futexes can be declared as <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/229668/">private</a>,  in which
case they avoid the 
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> semaphore and can be only be used by threads in a single
process.  The set of private futexes for a given process form the basis
for sharding and can, with the new patches, have exclusive access to a
per-process hash table of futex buckets.  All shared futexes still use
the single global hash table.  This approach addresses the NUMA issue
by having the hash table on the same NUMA node as the process, and
addresses the collision issue by dedicating more hash-table space per
process.  It only helps with private futexes, but these seem to be
the style most likely to be used by applications needing predictable
performance.</p>

<p>The choice of whether to allocate a per-process hash table is left as
a system-wide configuration which is where the tradeoffs can best be
assessed.  The application is allowed a small role in the choice of
when that table is allocated: a new futex command can request
immediate allocation and suggest a preferred size.  This avoids the
non-determinism that would result from the default policy of allocation
on first conflict.</p>
<p>It seems likely that this is the end of the story for now.  There has
been no distaste shown for the latest patch set and Gleixner is
confident that it solves his particular problem.  There would be no
point aiming for a greater level of perfection until another
demonstrated concrete need comes along.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Doesn't that mean the number of hash buckets will scale as roughly the *square* of the number of futexes? Per the birthday paradox, if you have 4096 buckets, I think you'd only need to create 76 futexes to get a &gt;50% chance of collision between at least one pair. The patch set TASK_MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 4096, so it wouldn't expand the hash any further and would just return an error. Even with 4096 buckets and only 10 futexes, there's still a &gt;1% chance of a collision, i.e. your application will fail with an out-of-resources error on a random 1% of occasions, which sounds non-ideal (if I understood it correctly).<br>

      I wonder if a more modern open-addressing hash table (such as Cuckoo hashing, or Hopscotch, or Robin Hood) could be suitable for the kernel. All of those have the advantage that they achieve O(1) lookup performance, even with very high load factors.

While it doesn't SOLVE the chaining (and hence determinism) problem, using dynamic/linear hashing would enable the hash table to expand without much overhead. And the overhead of the expansion is also almost deterministic. At the end of the day, however, any hash scheme is susceptible to a pathological hash that dumps most of the entries into one bucket.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Unlike most hash tables in the kernel, this one doesn't allow chaining: if a potential collision is ever detected the size of the hash table is doubled.</font><br>
<p>
Doesn't that also introduce another non-determinism? The cost of expanding the hash table is dependent on both the current size and the number of items in it?<br>

<p>
Yes, but the non-determinism affects the attachment of the futex, not the use.<br>
i.e. it is all done and out of the way before the realtime task starts its realtime work.<br>
So this non-determinism wouldn't matter.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It is easy to imagine an application embedding a futex in every instance of some object that is allocated and de-allocated in large numbers.</font><br>
<p>
For example, Larry Hastings mentioned adding a futex to every (c-)mutable python object as a precursor for removing the GIL in his "gilectomy" talk [1]. That would be rather a lot.<br>

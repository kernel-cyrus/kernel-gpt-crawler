           <p>January 7, 2014</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Valentine Sinitsyn</p>
           </div>
In the <a href="/Articles/578295/">first part of this series</a>, we
discussed what Jailhouse is, had a 
look at its data structures, covered how it is enabled, and what it
does to initialize CPUs.  This part concludes the series with a look at how
Jailhouse handles 
interrupts, what is done to create a cell, and how the
hypervisor is disabled.
<p>
<h4>Handling interrupts</h4>
<p>
Modern x86 processors are equipped with a "local advanced programmable
interrupt 
controller" (LAPIC) that handles delivery of inter-processor interrupts
(IPIs) as well as external interrupts that the I/O APIC, which is part of
the system's chipset, 
generates. Currently, Jailhouse virtualizes the LAPIC only; the I/O APIC is
simply 
mapped into the Linux cell, which is not quite safe because a malicious
guest (or 
Linux kernel module) could reprogram it to tamper with other guests' work.
<p>

The LAPIC works in one of two modes: "xAPIC" or "x2APIC". The xAPIC mode is
programmed via memory mapped I/O (MMIO), while the x2APIC uses
model-specific registers (MSRs). x2APIC mode is backward-compatible with
xAPIC, and its MSR addresses directly map to offsets in the MMIO page. When
Jailhouse's <tt>apic_init()</tt> function initializes the LAPIC, it checks
to see if x2APIC mode is enabled and sets up its <tt>apic_ops</tt> access
methods appropriately. Internally, Jailhouse refers to all APIC registers
by their MSR addresses. For xAPIC, these values are transparently converted
to the corresponding MMIO offsets (see the <tt>read_xapic()</tt> and
<tt>write_xapic()</tt> functions in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/apic.c"><tt>apic.c</tt></a>
as examples). 

<p>
Jailhouse virtualizes the LAPIC in both modes, however the mechanism is slightly
different. For xAPIC mode, a special LAPIC access page
(<tt>apic_access_page[PAGE_SIZE]</tt> defined in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/vmx.c"><tt>vmx.c</tt></a>)
is mapped into the guest's physical address space at <tt>XAPIC_BASE</tt>
(0xfee00000); this happens in
<tt>vmx_cell_init()</tt>. Later, in <tt>vmcs_setup()</tt>, LAPIC
virtualization is enabled; this way, every time a guest tries to access
the virtual LAPIC MMIO region, a trap back to the hypervisor (a "VM exit")
occurs. No data is really read from the virtual
LAPIC MMIO page or written to it, so CPUs can share this page. For x2APIC,
instead, 
normal MSR bitmaps are used. By default, Jailhouse traps access to all LAPIC
registers; however, if <tt>apic_init()</tt> detects that host LAPIC is in x2APIC
mode, the bitmap is changed so that only ICR (interrupt control register)
access is trapped. This happens when the master CPU executes <tt>vmx_init()</tt>.
<p>
There is a special case when a guest tries to access a virtual x2APIC on a
system where x2APIC is not enabled. In this case, the MSR bitmap remains
unmodified. Jailhouse intercepts accesses to all LAPIC registers and passes
incoming requests to xAPIC using the <tt>apic_ops</tt> access methods,
effectively 
emulating an x2APIC on top of xAPIC. Since LAPIC registers are referred to in
<a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/apic.c"><tt>apic.c</tt></a>
by their MSR addresses regardless the mode, this emulation has very 
little overhead.
<p>
The main reason behind Jailhouse's trapping of ICR (and few other registers)
access is isolation: a cell shouldn't be able to send an IPI to a CPU that
is not
in its own CPU set, and the ICR is what defines an interrupt's destination. To
achieve this isolation, <tt>apic_cpu_init()</tt> is called by the master CPU during
initialization; it stores the mapping from the <tt>apic_id</tt> to the
associated  <tt>cpu_id</tt> in
an array called, appropriately, <tt>apic_to_cpu_id</tt>.
When a CPU is assigned a logical LAPIC ID, Jailhouse ensures that it is
equal to <tt>cpu_id</tt>. This way, when an IPI is sent to a
physical or logical destination, the hypervisor is able to map it to
<tt>cpu_id</tt> 
and check if the CPU is in the cell's set. See <tt>apic_deliver_ipi()</tt> for
details.
<p>

Now let's turn to interrupt handling. In <tt>vmcs_setup()</tt>, Jailhouse
does not enable traps to the hypervisor on external interrupts and sets the
exception bitmaps to all zeroes. This means that the only interrupt that
results in a VM exit is a non-maskable interrupt (NMI); everything else is
dispatched through the guest's IDT and handled in guest mode. Since cells
assert full control over their own resources, this makes sense.

<p>

Currently, NMIs can only come from the hypervisor itself, which uses them
to control guest CPUs (<tt>arch_suspend_cpu()</tt> in <tt>apic.c</tt> is an
example). When an 
NMI occurs in a guest, that guest exits VM mode and Jailhouse re-throws the
NMI in host mode. The CPU dispatches it through the host IDT and jumps to
<tt>apic_nmi_handler()</tt>. It schedules another VM exit using a virtual
machines extensions (VMX)
feature known as a "preemption timer."  <tt>vmcs_setup()</tt> sets this
timer to zero, so, if it is enabled, a VM exit occurs immediately after VM
entry. The reason behind this indirection is serialization: this way, NMIs
(which are asynchronous by nature) are always delivered after entry into
the guest system and cannot interfere with the host-to-guest transition.

<p>
Jailhouse runs with interrupts disabled so no
interrupt other than an NMI can occur. Any exception in host mode is
considered to be a serious fault and results in panic.
<p>
<h4>Creating a cell</h4>
<p>
To create a new cell, Jailhouse needs to "shrink" the Linux cell by moving
hardware resources to the new cell. It also
obviously needs to load the guest image and perform a CPU reset to jump to the
guest's entry point.

This process starts in the Linux cell with the <tt>JAILHOUSE_CELL_CREATE</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt> command, leading to a <tt>jailhouse_cell_create()</tt>
function call in the kernel.  This function copies the cell configuration
and guest image from user space (the <tt>jailhouse</tt> user-space tool
reads these from files and stores them in memory). Then, the cell's
physical memory region is mapped and the guest image
is moved to the target (physical) address specified by the user. 
<p>
After
that, <tt>jailhouse_cell_create()</tt> calls the standard Linux
<tt>cpu_down()</tt> function to offline each CPU assigned to the new cell;
this is required so that the kernel won't try to schedule processes on
those CPUs. Finally, the loader issues a hypercall
(<tt>JAILHOUSE_HC_CELL_CREATE</tt>) using the <tt>VMCALL</tt> instruction
and passes a pointer to a <tt>struct jailhouse_cell_desc</tt> that
describes the new cell. This causes a VM exit from the Linux cell to the
hypervisor; <tt>vmx_handle_exit()</tt> dispatches the call to the
<tt>cell_create()</tt> function defined in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/control.c"><tt>hypervisor/control.c</tt></a>. 


In turn, <tt>cell_create()</tt> suspends all CPUs assigned to the cell
except the one 
executing the function (if it is in the cell's CPU set) to prevent races. This
is done in <tt>cell_suspend()</tt>, which indirectly signals an NMI (as
described above) to each CPU and waits for the <tt>cpu_stopped</tt> flag to
be set on the target's
<tt>cpu_data</tt>. Then, the cell configuration is mapped from the Linux cell to
a per-CPU region above <tt>FOREIGN_MAPPING_BASE</tt> in the host's virtual
address space 
(the loader copies this structure into kernel space).
<p>
Memory regions are checked as with the
Linux cell, and the new cell is allocated and initialized. After that,
the Linux cell is shrunk: all of the new cell's CPUs
are removed from the Linux cell's CPU set, the Linux cell's mappings for
the guest's physical addresses are 
destroyed, and the new cell's I/O resources have their bits set in the Linux
cell's <tt>io_bitmap</tt>, so accessing them will result in VM exit (and
panic).  Finally, the
new cell is added to the list of cells (which is a singly linked list having
<tt>linux_cell</tt> as its head) and each CPU in the cell is reset using
<tt>arch_cpu_reset()</tt>.
<p>
On
the next VM entry, the CPU will start executing code located at 0x000ffff0
in real mode. If one is running <tt>apic-demo</tt> according to the
instructions in the <a 
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/README">README
file</a>, this is where 
<tt>apic-demo.bin</tt>'s 16-bit entry point is. 
The address 0x000ffff0 is different 
from the normal x86 reset vector  (0xfffffff0), and there is a
reason: Jailhouse is not designed to run unmodified guests and has no BIOS
emulation, so it can simplify the boot process and skip much of the work
required for a real reset vector to work.
<p>
<h4>Cell initialization and destruction</h4>

<p>
Cells are represented by <tt>struct cell</tt>, defined in
<a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/include/asm/cell.h"><tt>x86/include/asm/cell.h</tt></a>. This
structure contains the page table directories for use with the
VMX and VT-d virtualization extensions, the <tt>io_bitmap</tt> for VMX,
<tt>cpu_set</tt>,  and other fields. It is 
initialized as follows. First, <tt>cell_init()</tt> copies a name for the
cell from 
a descriptor and allocates <tt>cpu_data-&gt;cpu_set</tt> if needed (sets
less than 64 
CPUs in size are stored within <tt>struct cell</tt> in the
<tt>small_cpu_set</tt> field). Then, 
<tt>arch_cell_create()</tt>, the same function that shrinks the Linux cell,
calls 
<tt>vmx_cell_init()</tt> for the new cell; it allocates VMX and VT-d
resources (page directories and I/O bitmap), creates EPT mappings for the
guest's 
physical address ranges (as per <tt>struct jailhouse_cell_desc</tt>), maps
the LAPIC access page described above, and copies the I/O bitmap to <tt>struct
cell</tt> from the cell descriptor (<tt>struct
jailhouse_cell_desc</tt>). For the Linux cell, the
master CPU calls this function during system-wide initialization. 
<p>
When the Linux cell is shrunk, <tt>jailhouse_cell_create()</tt> has already
put the detached CPUs offline. Linux never uses guest memory pages
since they are taken from the region reserved at boot as described in
part&nbsp;1. However, Jailhouse currently takes no action to detach I/O
resources or devices in general. If they were attached to the Linux cell, they
will remain attached, and it may cause a panic if a Linux driver tries to use
an I/O port that has been moved to another cell. To prevent this, you should not
assign these resources to the Linux cell.

<p>
As of this writing, Jailhouse has no support for cell
destruction. However this feature has recently appeared in the development
branch and will likely be available soon. When a cell is destroyed, its
CPUs and memory pages are reassigned back to the Linux cell, and other
resources are also returned to where they originated from.
<p>
<h4>Disabling Jailhouse</h4>

<p>
To disable Jailhouse, the user-space tool issues the
<tt>JAILHOUSE_DISABLE</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command, causing
a call to <tt>jailhouse_disable()</tt>. This function calls
<tt>leave_hypervisor()</tt> (found in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/main.c"><tt>main.c</tt></a>)
on each CPU in the Linux cell and waits for 
these calls 
to complete. Then the <tt>hypervisor_mem mapping</tt> created in
<tt>jailhouse_enable()</tt> is 
destroyed, the function brings up all offlined CPUs (which were presumably
moved to other cells), and exits. From this point, Linux kernel will be
running on bare metal again.
<p>

The <tt>leave_hypervisor()</tt> call issues a
<tt>JAILHOUSE_HC_DISABLE</tt> hypercall, causing a VM exit at the given
CPU, after which <tt>vmx_handle_exit()</tt> calls <tt>shutdown()</tt>. For
the first Linux CPU that called it, this function iterates over CPUs in all
cells other than Linux cell and calls <tt>arch_shutdown_cpu()</tt> for each
of these CPUs. A call to <tt>arch_shutdown_cpu()</tt> is equivalent to
suspending the CPU, setting <tt>cpu_data-&gt;shutdown_cpu</tt> to true,
then resuming the CPU. As described above, this sequence transfers the
control to <tt>apic_handle_events()</tt>, but this time this function
detects that the CPU is shutting down. It disables the LAPIC and effectively
executes a <tt>VMXOFF; HLT</tt> sequence to disable VMX on the CPU and halt
it. This way, the hypervisor is disabled on all CPUs outside of the Linux cell.

<p>

When <tt>shutdown()</tt> returns, VT-d is disabled and the hypervisor
restores the Linux environment for the CPU. First, the
<tt>cpu_data-&gt;linux_*</tt> fields are copied from VMCS guest area. Then,
<tt>arch_cpu_restore()</tt> is called to disable  VMX (without halting the
CPU this time) and restore various register values from
<tt>cpu_data-&gt;linux_*</tt>. Afterward, the general-purpose registers are
popped from the hypervisor stack, the Linux stack is restored, the RAX
register is zeroed and a <tt>RET</tt> instruction is issued. For the Linux
kernel, everything will look like <tt>leave_hypervisor()</tt> has returned
successfully; this happens to each CPU in the Linux cell. After that, any
offlined CPUs (likely halted by <tt>arch_shutdown_cpu()</tt>) are brought
back to the active state, as described earlier.

<p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
Jailhouse is a young project that is developing quickly. It is a
lightweight system that does not intend to replace full-featured hypervisors
like Xen or KVM, but this doesn't mean that Jailhouse itself is
feature-limited. It is rare project that has a potential both in a
classroom and in production, and we hope this article helped you to
understand it better.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It would be interesting to try. However one may argue that having many cores alone isn't enough because of caches, buses and other shared resources. Some benchmarking will certainly be helpful here.<br>

Oops I've missed that, sorry. It should be double-interesting to benchmark it then.<br>

If you are interested in partitioning hypervisors you might also take a look at the Muen project [1], [2], [3]. Its way of operation is very similar to Jailhouse but the hypervisor, or the Separation Kernel (SK) as we call it, is written in SPARK, a subset of the Ada language specially designed to enable formal verification of the code.<br>
<p>
We proved the Muen kernel to be absent of runtime errors.<br>
<p>
The system configuration is created from a policy in XML-format during build and compiled directly into the hypervisor. Muen does not rely on other parties to setup the system which significantly reduces the amount of trusted code.<br>
<p>
The current development branch also supports Linux as VM.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

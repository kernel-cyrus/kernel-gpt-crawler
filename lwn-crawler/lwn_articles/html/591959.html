<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2014/">2014 LSFMM Summit</a>
</div>
The <a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/">Trinity</a> tool
is a system call fuzz-testing utility for the Linux kernel.  By supplying
random data to the kernel in a focused way, Trinity has managed to expose a
large number of bugs over the years.  Trinity maintainer Dave Jones
addressed the memory management track at the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
and Memory Management Summit to talk about how he is using the tool to
turn up memory management bugs in particular.  
<p>
He started by describing an idea he heard from Al Viro: create a memory
range with <tt>mmap()</tt>, unmap a single page in the middle of that
range, then pass the result to various system calls and see what happens.
As he described it, "all hell broke loose."  Large numbers of bugs have
been turned up, followed by "heroic efforts" in the memory management
community to fix them.  As a result of those efforts, he said, he is now
unable to find any problems in the 3.14-rc7 kernel's memory management
code, which is a good thing.
<p>
On the other hand, Sasha Levin has been using Trinity to find bugs in the
linux-next tree, where they are rather more plentiful.  Those bugs often
move into the mainline during the merge window.  Bringing more stability to
the code in linux-next before it is merged would be a worthwhile thing to
do.
<p>
In general, Dave said, Trinity is good at finding bugs in the dark corners of
the kernel that nobody makes much use of.  So areas like huge pages, page
migration, and the <tt>mbind()</tt> system call have been fertile ground.
In the case of <tt>mbind()</tt>, it turned out that all callers were going
through a user-space library.  That library did argument checking, so,
naturally, the system call itself did not.  The result was a predictable
pile of bugs which have now been fixed.
<p>
Lots of parts of the memory management subsystem are, he said, simply not
getting adequate testing now.  Trinity helps in this area, but its memory
management testing is still on the rudimentary side.  He wants to develop
it further; he plans to work on memory management fuzzing for much of the
rest of the year.  But, even now, Trinity is finding more bugs in the
memory management code than can be dealt with.
<p>
Huge pages generate lots of bug reports from Fedora users; they also are
the source of lots of problems found by Trinity.  Reproducing those bugs in
any more standard setting is hard, though; many of them involve
applications, like the Java runtime, that Dave is unfamiliar with and
uninterested in learning more about.  So, for now, transparent huge pages
are simply turned off for his Trinity runs.
<p>
Reproduction of crashes provoked by Trinity is an ongoing problem in general.  The
tool can log everything that it does, but the logging is, itself, an
expensive operation that can change timings to the point that a lot of
problems simply go away.
Many crashes are also the result of corrupted internal state in the kernel;
the sequence that causes the corruption may happen a long time before that
corruption causes the kernel to crash.  So establishing the cause of
crashes can be difficult.
<p>
Dave had a couple of requests for memory management developers.  One was
for anybody adding new flags to existing system calls; when that happens,
he would like to get a note so that he can start testing calls with that
flag.  He'll often notice them in the patch stream anyway, but an explicit
notification is more reliable.  The other thing he would like is to see
more developers running Trinity on their systems.  It is trivial to set up,
he said; so there is no real reason not to make use of it.

Is it possible to log what it is *planning* to do rather than logging in situ?<br>

only as long as nothing that Trinity does involves multiple threads/processes, and as long as nothing that it does depends on the response that it gets back from the system that could possibly change from run to run (or kernel to kernel)<br>

IMO it's the kernel, not Trinity, that should be improving it's logging mechanism.<br>
<p>
Think of Trinity as a random black box userspace app. Heck, think of it as some random DB server that has wacky coders. You don't solve kernel crashes by asking userspace apps to add debug information, you add those debug facilities in the kernel.<br>

<p>
I would love to have authoritative list of newly added kernel interfaces as well. There were cases where I found out about new syscall flags/values more or less by chance and I had to write tests and update the manual pages as well. It would be far more easier if we had such list so that we can easily check that that newly added interfaces are properly documented and tested.<br>

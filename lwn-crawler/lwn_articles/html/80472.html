<h1>VM changes in 2.6.6</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 14, 2004 by corbet]

Among the patches merged into the upcoming 2.6.6 release is a set of
virtual memory changes.  Changes to such a fundamental subsystem are always
of interest, especially in the middle of a "stable" kernel series.  Here,
then, is a quick discussion of what has transpired.
<p>
In response to the reverse mapping VM discussions over the last month or
so, Hugh Dickins has posted a series of patches which prepare the kernel
for a full object-based reverse-mapping scheme and the removal of the
per-page PTE chains.  Hugh's patches carefully leave room for the inclusion
of either his <a href="/Articles/77106/">anonmm</a> patches or Andrea
Arcangeli's <a href="/Articles/75198/">anon_vma</a> work,
though he seems to expect that anon_vma will win out.  The full set of
patches posted so far can be found in the "memory management" part of the
"patches and updates" section, below.
<p>
Of those patches, the first three have been merged as of this writing.  <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/79913/">rmap&nbsp;1</a> simply creates a new
include file (<tt>linux/rmap.h</tt>) and moves much of the reverse-mapping
declarations there.  The second patch (<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/79914/">rmap&nbsp;2</a>) changes the way the
swap subsystem keeps track of swap cache pages; this change is needed to
free up a couple of <tt>struct page</tt> fields for reverse mapping tasks.
Finally, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/79915/">rmap&nbsp;3</a> finishes
out the <tt>struct page</tt> work for various architectures.
<p>
Later patches in Hugh's series get more ambitious; <a
href="/Articles/80242/">rmap&nbsp;7</a> adds object-based reverse mapping
for file-backed memory.  Those patches have not been merged as of this
writing, however.
<p>
A completely different set of patches which changes how the page cache
works has been merged.  The <a href="/Articles/80474/">description</a> of
this work, as written by Andrew Morton, reads:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The basic problem which we (mainly Daniel McNeil) have been
	struggling with is in getting a really reliable fsync() across the
	page lists while other processes are performing writeback against
	the same file.  It's like juggling four bars of wet soap with your
	eyes shut while someone is whacking you with a baseball bat.
</div>
<p>
This work made some fundamental changes in how page cache pages are
tracked.  The <tt>struct page</tt> structure has long included a field
called "<tt>list</tt>", being a <tt>list_head</tt> structure used to track
the state of the page.  When the page is marked dirty, or placed under I/O,
it is put on a list with other such pages.  Unfortunately, managing those
lists as the state of the page changes proves to be difficult; hence the
juggling analogy.
<p>
In response, the page lists have been removed altogether; as a
side-benefit, this change shrinks <tt>struct page</tt> by eight bytes - a
significant savings, considering that there is one such structure for every
physical page in the system.  The lists have been replaced with an enhanced
radix tree which supports "tagging" of pages.  When a page is dirtied, it
is simply marked dirty in the radix tree, rather than being added to a
list.  Similarly, pages which are currently being written back to disk are
marked.  A new set of radix tree operations allows the kernel to find these
pages when the need arises.  Searching the tree is not as fast as following
a dedicated list, but the radix tree implementation appears to be fast
enough that few people will notice the difference.
<p>
These changes required touching a lot of VM and page cache code; every user
of the <tt>page-&gt;list</tt> field had to be fixed.  As a result of the
changes, the order in which dirty pages are written to disk has changed;
writing always happens in file-offset order now.  This change appears to be
an improvement for many applications; Andrew reports as much as 30% faster
benchmark results.  I/O can slow down for some situations involving
parallel writes on SMP systems, however.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <i>As a result of the changes, the order in which dirty pages are written to disk has changed; writing always happens in file-offset order now.</i>
<p>
I find that hard to believe.  The order in which pages are written to disk is controlled by the block layer/device driver, and tends to be disk address order.  I presume this means to say the order in which the I/Os to write dirty pages to disk are requested of the block layer always happens in file-offset order (as opposed to order in which they became dirty) now.  It's hard to see how that makes a big difference in performance, considering I/Os to clean all the dirty pages are requested at about the same time.

      Actually, the order is determined by the I/O scheduler.  But the scheduler can only work with requests once they are handed to it.  Changing that order can make a big difference in what the driver sees.  And, apparently, in some situations, the performance difference can be significant - either better or worse.

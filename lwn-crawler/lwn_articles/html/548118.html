Huadong Liu led a memory-management-track session on the performance of the
Linux swap subsystem.  The discussion almost certainly did not go the way
he intended, but it may have some interesting results for future swap
development.
<p>
Huadong started with a complaint: he had been running some tests using a
solid-state drive as a swap device and was not getting the performance that
he expected.  There was, he said, too much lock contention, too much TLB
flushing overhead, and, perhaps most significantly, a scattered I/O pattern
resulting from multiple processes running in direct reclaim at the same
time.  He also suggested that readahead on page faults was impacting
performance for workloads with random access patterns.
<p>
Where things went a little off the rails, though, was when Huadong said
that the system was reclaiming page-cache pages far too aggressively.  When
he set the "swappiness" parameter (<a href="/Articles/83588/">described
here</a> in 2004) to 200 (causing the system to
reclaim swap-backed pages in preference to file-backed pages), performance
improved considerably.  Hugh Dickins 
asked why Huadong felt the need to change the swapping balance in that
way.  Various possible reasons were passed back and forth, but the reality
appeared to be this: the system was using a solid-state drive for swap, but
everything else was on rotating storage.  So, naturally, swap operations
(involving anonymous pages) would be faster than page-cache operations.  On
a fully solid-state system, the results would be likely to differ
considerably.
<p>
That was the jumping-off point for a new proposal from Hugh, who claimed
that the memory management subsystem — and swap in particular — should be
much more responsive to the relative speeds of the devices used for backing
store.  Currently all such devices are treated equally, but, increasingly,
they are anything but equal.  The system would perform a lot better if it
could, for example, make a point of using faster devices before resorting
to the slower ones.  That was, he said, a lesson that could be learned from
Huadong's experience.
<p>
Making proper use of information about backing-device speeds, Hugh said,
would require a fundamental change to how 
swapping is handled in the kernel.  Currently, when a page is swapped out,
its location is stored in the page table entry (PTE).  That is problematic
because it requires that location to be chosen quite early and makes it
impossible to change thereafter.  If the location of the swapped page on
disk could be chosen at the last moment, it would be easier to direct pages
to the fastest devices; the swap code could also place outgoing pages next
to each other, allowing the block layer to merge the resulting I/O
requests.
<p>
Getting there would require, inevitably, the addition of another layer of
indirection.  The "swap location" stored in the PTE would be an index into
a table where the real location could be found.  That location would not be
assigned until the time came to actually write the page to swap, allowing
the decision to be deferred until the last moment.  This mechanism would
also allow swapped pages to be relocated if desired; a little-used page on
a fast device could eventually be migrated to slower storage, for example.
<p>
Hugh claimed that this bit of work should be done first; that failure to
add the necessary infrastructure could impede the improvement of the swap
subsystem in general.  Mel Gorman worried, though, that basing swap
decisions on the speed of the backing store device would make the system
less predictable and could fall apart on some workloads.  Andi Kleen
suggested using more huge pages; performing swap in large batches would
make a lot of the pain go away.  Rik van Riel worried that using huge pages
would lead to internal fragmentation and more I/O bandwidth consumption, but
Andi responded that bandwidth is not the limiting factor — the number of
I/O operations that can be performed is the bottleneck.
<p>
In the end, the consensus seemed to be that Hugh's plan for deferred
assignment of swap location made sense.  We may see an implementation
posted in the not-too-distant future.  The session ended with Hugh
apologizing for "hijacking" the discussion, but nobody seemed to upset
about the direction things had taken.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Honestly, I think that a Frontswap-style API might well be better for implementing real, physical swap. It would certainly be interesting to be able to 'stack' this kind of thing - have a compression backend (zswap) backed by SSD backed by ramster (assuming a nice, low-latency network) backed by slow HDD.<br>

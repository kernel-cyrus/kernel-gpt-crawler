<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 1, 2015</br>
           </div>
<a href="/Articles/648995/">Last week's merge window summary</a> noted that
"things are just getting started."  Since then, Linus has pulled nearly
8,000 non-merge changesets into the mainline repository, making the total
for the 4.2 merge window just short of 11,000.  It is fair to say that
things have truly started now.
<p>
Whether 4.2 will, as <a
href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/KZPWD3KURbK">Linus
recently predicted</a>, be the busiest development cycle ever remains to be
seen.  That record is currently held by 3.15, which saw just over 12,000
changesets pulled during its merge window.  Things seem to be winding down
on the 4.2 front, so it may not exceed 3.15's totals.  There is no doubt,
though, that this is a busy development cycle.
<p>
Some of the more interesting changes merged since last week's summary
include: 
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/635771/">Linux security module stacking
     patches</a> have been merged, finally giving the kernel the ability to
     combine security modules in a generic manner.
<p>
<li> A new packet classifier called "Flower" has been added.  With Flower,
     "<q>you will be able to classify packets based on a configurable
     combination of packet keys and masks.</q>"  This classifier appears
     to be entirely lacking in documentation, unfortunately.
<p>
<li> A driver for GENEVE (<a
     href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gross-geneve-02">Generic
     Network Virtualization Encapsulation</a>) tunnels has been added to
     the networking subsystem.
<p>
<li> The netfilter subsystem has gained support for ingress-time packet
     classification. 
<p>
<li> Unix-domain sockets now support the <tt>splice()</tt> system call.
<p>
<li> Support for the <a href="/Articles/645115/">delay-gradient
     congestion-control algorithm</a> has been merged.
<p>
<li> The F2FS filesystem has gained support for a number of features
     including per-file encryption and the <tt>FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE</tt>
     and <tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt> <tt>fallocate()</tt>
     operations.
<p>
<li> The ext4 filesystem now supports the <a
     href="/Articles/629965/"><tt>FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE</tt> 
     operation</a>, which inserts a range of zero-filled space into an existing
     file. 
<p>
<li> Support for the Renesas H8/300 architecture was removed a couple of
     years ago due to lack of maintenance; that code has now been rewritten,
     fixed up, and merged back into the kernel.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/648292/">control group writeback patches</a>
     have been merged.  This work allows for better control of data
     writeback within control groups, fixing an area that has not worked
     well for a long time.
<p>
<li> The device mapper's <tt>dm-cache</tt> module has gained support for
     stochastic multi-queue caching.  See <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/66a636356647a9be8885c2ce2948de126577698a">the
     commit message</a> for details.
<p>
<li> The thermal control subsystem has a new power-allocator governor,
     designed to divide power among heat sources while keeping the overall
     temperature of the system within bounds.  See <a
     href="/Articles/649777/"><tt>Documentation/thermal/power_allocator.txt</tt></a>
     for information on how it works.
<p>
<li> The XFS filesystem has gained the ability to directly access
     persistent-memory devices via the <a href="/Articles/610174/">DAX</a>
     interface. 
<p>
<li> The CIFS filesystem can now handle (in an experimental mode) version
     3.1.1 of the SMB protocol.
<p>     
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>

     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The networking subsystem's "page fragment" allocator has been moved
     into the memory-management subsystem.  Page fragments are arbitrarily
     sized chunks of memory, allocated for short periods of time.  They are
     allocated and freed with:
<p>
<pre>
    void *__alloc_page_frag(struct page_frag_cache *nc, unsigned int fragsz, 
                            gfp_t gfp_mask);
    void __free_page_frag(void *addr);
</pre>
<p>

<li> The kernel self-tests subsystem has gained tests for the futex and
     secure computing ("seccomp") subsystems.
<p>
<li> There is a new kernel subsystem called "libnvdimm," which provides
     various types of access to non-volatile memory (NVM) arrays.  At the lowest
     level, it is able to enumerate arrays found on the system and present
     them as devices to the rest of the system.  There are some add-on
     layers as well:
     <p>
     <ul>

     <li> Some new functions have been introduced for the safe writing of
     	  data to NVM devices: <tt>memremap_pmem()</tt>,
     	  <tt>memcpy_to_pmem()</tt>, and <tt>wmb_pmem()</tt>.  Their
     	  purpose is to ensure that data has actually been written to the
     	  device and is not lurking in a processor or bus cache somewhere â€”
     	  that it's actually persistent, in other words.
     <p>
     <li> "Regions" are ranges of NVM that are separated out into separate
     	  virtual devices; they may span more than one physical device.
     <p>
     <li> The "BLK" driver provides a mode of access where only a small
     	  "window" into an NVM device is mapped into the kernel's address
     	  space at any given time.  The primary purpose for this mode
     	  appears to be to minimize the chances of persistent-memory
     	  corruption via writes to random pointers.
     <p>
     <li> The "BTT" (block translation table) module adds an indirection
     	  layer to provide for atomic, sector-sized access to NVM arrays.
     	  The idea is to prevent the creation of corrupted filesystem
     	  blocks should the system go down in the middle of a block-write
     	  operation. 
     </ul>

<p>
     See <a
     href="/Articles/649840/"><tt>Documentation/nvdimm/nvdimm.txt</tt></a>
     for lots of details.

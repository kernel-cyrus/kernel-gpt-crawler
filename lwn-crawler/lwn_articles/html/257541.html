<p> As the amount of RAM installed in systems grows, it would seem that
memory pressure should reduce, but, much like salaries or hard disk
space, usage grows to fill (or overflow) the available capacity.  Operating
systems have dealt with this problem for decades by using virtual memory
and swapping, but techniques that work well with 4 gigabyte address spaces
may not scale well to systems with 1 terabyte.  That scalability problem is
at the root of several different ideas for changing the kernel, from
supporting <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/250335/">larger page
sizes</a> to <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224829/">avoiding memory
fragmentation</a>.  </p>

<p> Another approach to scaling up the memory management subsystem was
recently posted to linux-kernel by Rik van Riel.  His
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/257223/">patch</a> is meant to reduce the
amount of time the kernel spends looking for a memory page to evict when it
needs to load a new page.  He lists two main deficiencies of the current
page replacement algorithm. The first is that it sometimes evicts the wrong
page; this cannot be eliminated, but its frequency might be reduced.  The second is the heart of what he is trying to accomplish:

<div class="BigQuote">
The kernel scans over pages that should not be evicted.  On systems with a
few GB of RAM, this can result in the VM using an annoying amount of CPU.
On systems with &gt;128GB of RAM, this can knock the system out for hours
since excess CPU use is compounded with lock contention and other issues.
</div>
</p>

<p> A system with 1TB of 4K pages has 256 million pages to deal with.
Searching through the pages stored on lists in the kernel can take an
enormous amount of time.  According to van Riel, most of that time is spent
searching pages that won't be evicted anyway, so in order to deal with
systems of that size, the search needs to focus in on likely candidates.
</p>

<p>
Linux tries to optimize its use of physical memory, by keeping it full,
using any memory not needed by processes for caching file data in the page
cache.  Determining which pages are not being used by processes and
striking a balance between the page cache and process memory is the job of
the page replacement algorithm.  It is that algorithm that van Riel would
eventually like to see replaced.
</p>

<p>
The current set of patches, though, take a smaller step.  In today's
kernel, there are two lists of pages, active and inactive, for each memory
zone.  Pages move
between them based on how recently they were used.  When it is time
to find a page to evict, the kernel searches the inactive list for
candidates.  In many cases, it is looking for page cache pages,
particularly those that are unmodified and can simply be dropped, but has
to wade through an enormous number of process-memory pages to find them.
</p>

<p>
The solution proposed is to break both lists apart, based on the type of
page.  Page cache pages (aka file pages) and process-memory pages (aka
anonymous pages) will each live on their own active and inactive lists.
When the kernel is looking for a specific type, it can choose the proper
list to reduce the amount of time spent searching considerably.
</p>

<p>
This patch is an update to an earlier proposal by van Riel, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/226756/">covered here last March</a>.  The
patch is now broken into ten parts, allowing for easier reviewing.  It has
also been updated to the latest kernel, modified to work with various
features (like <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/211505/">lumpy reclaim</a>)
that have been added in the interim.
</p> 

<p>
Additional features are planned to be added down the road, as outlined on
van Riel's <a href="http://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign">page
replacement design web page</a>.  Adding a non-reclaimable list for pages
that are locked to physical memory with <tt>mlock()</tt>, or are part of a
RAM filesystem and cannot be evicted, is one of the first changes listed.
It makes little sense to scan past these pages.
</p>

<p>
Another feature that van Riel lists is to track recently evicted pages so
that, if they get loaded again, the system can reduce the likelihood of
another eviction.  This should help keep pages in the page cache that get
accessed somewhat infrequently, but are not completely unused.  There are
also various ideas about limiting the sizes of the active and inactive
lists to put a bound on worst-case scenarios.  van Riel's plans also
include making better decisions about when to run the out-of-memory (OOM)
killer as well as making it faster to choose its victim.
</p>

<p>
Overall, it is a big change
to how the page replacement code works today, which is why it will be
broken up into smaller chunks.  By making changes that add incremental
improvements, and getting them into the hands of
developers and testers, the hope is that the bugs can be shaken out more
easily.  Before that can happen, though, this set of patches must
pass muster with the kernel hackers and be merged.  The external
user-visible impacts of these particular patches should be small, but they are fairly intrusive,
touching a fair amount of code.  In addition, memory management patches
tend to have a tough path into the kernel.

One can configure which scheduler kernel should use.  Why not also what 
page replacement algorithm it should use?

      <p>Linux' page aging algorithm is very simple, and as pointed out by 
Rick, also doesn't scale well. This is about the same situation as it was 
with the scheduler before the O(1) scheduler came. People should remember 
that there isn't such a simple binary "active/inactive" flag for pages, 
as well. Pages have a usage history, which can be used to predict future 
use, and this should be used to implement a O(1) page replacement 
algorithm.</p>

<p>Basically, the simple two lists would have to be split up in a number 
of buckets - pages that have been used recently go to higher buckets, 
pages that haven't been used go to lower buckets. Different pages can 
start their live in different buckets - e.g. read-only cache pages 
probably start somewhere low, and can be evicted quickly. Picking a free 
page is then quite fast: Take an element of the lowest non-empty bucket. 
It doesn't have to be the least recently used one, random replacement 
strategies are not that bad, either.</p>

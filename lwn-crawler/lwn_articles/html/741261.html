<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 13, 2017</br>
           </div>
For various reasons related to accounting and security, there is recurring
interest in having the kernel identify the container that holds any given
process.  Attempts to implement that functionality tend to run into the
same roadblock, though: the kernel has no concept of what a "container" is,
and there is seemingly little desire to change that state of affairs.  A 
solution to this problem may exist in the form of a neglected
patch called "ptags", which enables the attachment of arbitrary tags to
processes.
<p>
Given that containers are at the receiving end of a lot of attention
currently, it is natural to wonder why the kernel refuses to recognize
them.  The kernel does provide the features needed to implement containers:
namespaces for isolation, control groups for resource management, seccomp
and security modules to implement security policies, etc.  But there is
little agreement over what actually constitutes a container, and there is
still a lot of experimentation going on with interesting new ways of
implementing the container concept.  When, as part of the recent <a
href="/Articles/740621/">discussion on container IDs for auditing</a>, it
was suggested that use of namespaces identified a container, Casey
Schaufler <a href="/Articles/741263/">responded</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	You might think so, but I am assured that you can have a container
	without using namespaces. Intel's "Clear Containers", which use
	virtualization technology, are one example. I have considered
	creating "Smack Containers" using mandatory access control
	technology, more to press the point that "containers" is a
	marketing concept, not technology.
</div>
<p>
An attempt to codify such a diverse and rapidly evolving concept (be it a
"marketing concept" or not) into a kernel API is likely to end in tears.
It would have a strong chance of either stifling ongoing container
development or just proving to not be useful with next year's idea of what
a container should be.  So there is indeed a good case to be made for not
recognizing the "container" concept inside the kernel.
<p>
That position may be entirely logical, but it doesn't make the use cases
for identifying containers and associating processes with them go away.
More than once, Schaufler has suggested that a module called "ptags" is a
better solution to this problem, so your editor decided to go take a look.
<p>
Ptags is a proposed security module that was <a
href="/Articles/703064/">posted</a> to the LSM list a few times by José
Bollo in late 2016.  It received little attention at the time and appears
to have 
disappeared into that place where unloved kernel patches go.  There is <a
href="https://gitlab.com/jobol/ptags">a GitLab repository</a> for the
project, but it has not seen any commits since early February.  Ptags has
clearly stalled; perhaps
what the project needs is some wider attention and more feedback.
<p>
As one might expect, ptags enables the addition of tags to processes.  Those tags
can be seen and manipulated through a new <tt>/proc</tt> file:
<tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/attr/ptags</tt>.  Individual threads of a process can
have their own tags in
<tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/tasks/<i>TID</i>/attr/ptags</tt>.  Tags are UTF-8
strings (up to 4000 bytes in length, which may be a bit excessive),
optionally associated with a string value (32,700 bytes or less — ditto).
There are some limitations on control characters, but just about anything
goes, so valid tags would include:
<p>
<pre>
    IS_EVIL
    CONTAINER_ID=ae883c
    कंटेनर=विपणन
</pre>
<p>
The colon character has a special meaning: it is used as a sort of
namespace separator.  So, for example, if a system were running the Ultimate
Marketing Container Manager (UMCM), it might tag processes with their
container IDs using something like:
<p>
<pre>
    UMCM:CONTAINER_ID=foo
</pre>
<p>
If a process is allowed to change some other process's tags (more on that
below), such changes are effected by writing to the appropriate
<tt>ptags</tt> file.  Preceding a tag with "<tt>+</tt>" adds that tag to a
process, while "<tt>-</tt>" removes it.  Normally a process's tags will be
stripped if it calls <tt>execve()</tt>, but that behavior can be changed by
prepending "<tt>@</tt>" (the "keep flag") to the tag name.  Tags are
copied when a process calls <tt>clone()</tt> or <tt>fork()</tt>, though. 
There is a
simple glob mechanism for deleting tags or changing keep flags in bulk.
<p>
By default, unprivileged processes cannot change tags — neither their own nor
another process's.  Permissions to change tags with a specific namespace
prefix can be delegated using the tag system itself.  If the administrator
wanted the UMCM process to be able to control tags starting with
<tt>UMCM:</tt> on other processes, the UMCM process would be given one or
more of these tags:
<p>
<pre>
    ptags:UMCM:add
    ptags:UMCM:sub
    ptags:UMCM:set
    ptags:UMCM:others
</pre>
<p>
The first tag allows the UMCM process to add tags starting with
<tt>UMCM:</tt> to itself.  The "<tt>sub</tt>" tag
allows removing those tags from itself, and "<tt>set</tt>" allows changing
existing tags.  The "<tt>others</tt>" tag is different, in that it causes
any other permissions on the <tt>UMCM:</tt> namespace to apply globally.
If a process's tags include both <tt>ptags:UMCM:add</tt> and
<tt>ptags:UMCM:others</tt>, it can add tags in the <tt>UMCM:</tt> namespace
to any other process in the system.  That permission does also require that
the process in question can write to the target process's <tt>ptags</tt>
file, which may be restricted by access permissions or another security
module.
<p>
Other than the special <tt>ptags:</tt> tags, nothing in the kernel uses or
cares about process tags in any way.  They are maintained as a service for
user space, making it easy to associate information with processes in a way
that those processes cannot change.  It would seem that this sort
of mechanism would work well for the container use case; a container
manager could tag processes in a way that matches its particular scheme.
Meanwhile, the kernel need not know anything about any particular
conception of what a container is.
<p>
One drawback to this scheme, beyond the fact that it's not in the mainline
and doesn't appear to be headed that way is that, <a
href="/Articles/741288/">according to Schaufler</a>: "<q>PTAGS
unfortunately needs module stacking, but how hard could that be?</q>"
The answer to that question would be "<a href="/Articles/635771/">fairly
hard</a>", but there is another question that is worth asking: does the
ptags mechanism need to be a security module at all?  The usual point of
security modules is to restrict access to system resources in some way, but
ptags doesn't do that.
<p>
If the ptags approach looks like the right solution to the container-ID
problem, it might be worth implementing it as a core kernel feature.
Processes have a long list of attributes in a Linux system; the tags would
just be more of the same.  That would ensure that tags would be available
on the systems that need them, eliminate the stacking problem and, in
general, reduce the potential for unfortunate interactions with other
security modules.  "Container" might not be appropriate as a core-kernel
concept, but "process tags" might be.
<p>
But that, of course, would require somebody to either push the existing
module forward or implement a similar scheme in another way.  But, as
Schaufler asked, how hard can that be?  As the pressure to solve the
container-ID problem continues to grow, some developer may well be
motivated to give this approach a try.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Interesting idea. It is, in some senses, like processor architectures that have one or more special purpose registers reserved for user use. They are saved and restored on context switches but don't have any role in the processor architecture. Instead, they hold things like a pointer to the current thread's user space context, such as thread local storage. Something that just holds a bit of information in the kernel for use outside the kernel might be just the solution to the container ID issue.<br>
<p>
Thanks for the pointer to this!<br>

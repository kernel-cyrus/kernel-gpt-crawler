           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 3, 2021</br>
           </div>
Computing terminology can be counterintuitive at times, but even a
longtime participant in the industry may have to look twice at the notion
of named anonymous memory.  That, however, is just the concept that <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210827191858.2037087-1-surenb@google.com/">this
patch set</a> posted by Suren Baghdasaryan proposes to add.  There are, it
seems, developers who find the idea useful enough to not only overcome the
initial cognitive dissonance that comes with it, but also to resurrect an
eight-year-old patch to get it into the kernel.
<p>
Memory used by user space is divided into two broad categories: file-backed
and anonymous.  A file-backed page of memory has a direct correspondence to
a page in a file in persistent storage; when the page is clean, its
contents are identical to what is found on disk.  An anonymous page,
instead, is not associated with a file in the filesystem; these pages hold
a process's data areas, stacks, and so on.  If an anonymous page must be
written to persistent storage (to reclaim the page for another user,
usually), space must be allocated in the swap area to hold its contents.
<p>
Whether a given process's memory use is dominated by file-backed or
anonymous pages varies from one workload to the next.  In many cases, the
bulk of a 
process's pages will be anonymous; this, it seems, is more likely in
workloads with a lot of cloud-computing clients, which tend not to use many
local files.  Android devices are one place where this sort of behavior can
be found.  If one is trying to optimize the memory usage of such a
workload, anonymous pages can pose a challenge; since the pages are
anonymous, with no information about how they were created, it is difficult
to know what any given anonymous page is being used for.
<p>
That situation can be improved by making anonymous pages just a bit less
anonymous.  If it were possible to know which user-space subsystem or
library created 
a given page, it would become easier to figure out who the biggest users
are.  Information on, say, how many anonymous pages in the system were
created by the <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">jemalloc
library</a>, for example, could help determine whether jemalloc users are
the best target for optimization efforts.  Linux systems, however, do not
make it easy (or even possible) to get that sort of information.
<p>
Making things better requires obtaining some cooperation from user space,
since the kernel cannot know which subsystem is allocating any given page.
To that end, at the core of the patch set is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210827191858.2037087-3-surenb@google.com/">this
patch from Colin Cross</a>, which was <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1383170047-21074-2-git-send-email-ccross@android.com/">originally
posted in 2013</a>.  It adds a new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
operation:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SET_VMA, PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME, start, len, name);
</pre>
<p>
This operation will cause the given <tt>name</tt> to be associated with the
<tt>len</tt> anonymous pages beginning at <tt>start</tt>.  In truth, the name is 
associated with the virtual memory area (VMA) structure describing a range of
memory.  Thus, what actually happens is that all pages that are part of
the VMAs in the given range will have the name assigned to them, even
if the pages themselves are not within that range.  Each <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
call usually creates a VMA (though there are complications), so all pages
associated with any given VMA will normally have been created in the same
way. 

<p>
The <tt>maps</tt> and <tt>smaps</tt> files in each process's <tt>/proc</tt>
directory already contain a lot of information about that process's VMAs.
With this patch set applied, those files will also contain the name that
has been associated with the anonymous VMAs, if any; the name is duly
checked for printability before being accepted.  Using that information,
system tools can associate pages with those names and, from there, with the
subsystems that created them.
<p>
Assigning a name to a VMA does not seem like a difficult endeavor, but it
has proved to be the trickiest part of this patch.  A system can have a lot
of processes, each of which can have a lot of VMAs, so the management of
these names needs to scale reasonably well.  Previous versions of the patch
set have tried just pointing to the provided names in user space; this
avoids the need to allocate memory in the kernel but, as Kees Cook <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/202009031031.D32EF57ED@keescook/">pointed out</a>, it
presents some interesting security problems as well.  At the time, Cook
suggested simply copying the strings into kernel space.
<p>
While copying the strings  works, there is still a little problem: when a
process forks, its VMAs 
are copied for the new child.  Now all of those name strings must be copied
too.  Baghdasaryan ran a worst-case test, with a process creating 64,000
VMAs, assigning a long name to each, then calling <tt>fork()</tt>, the
result was a nearly 40% performance regression.  Even if such numbers will
not be seen in real-world workloads, a slowdown of that magnitude is sure
to raise eyebrows.
<p>
As a way of avoiding excessive eyebrow elevation, Baghdasaryan <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210827191858.2037087-4-surenb@google.com/">added a
mechanism</a> to use shared, reference-counted names.  A <tt>fork()</tt>
call now need only increase the reference counts rather than allocate
memory and copy a string.  With this added machinery in place, the
performance cost is "<q>reduced 3-4x</q>" in the worst case, and is
said to not be measurable for more reasonable test cases.
<p>
This functionality is evidently useful; Android has been using it for
years, having kept the original patch going for all of that time.  Thus
far, the review comments have focused on relatively minor issues — which
characters should be allowed in names, for example.  So there would not
appear to be a lot of obstacles to overcome before this work can be
merged.  For this feature, it seems, eight years of waiting on the
sidelines should be enough, and anonymous pages may soon lose a bit of
their anonymity.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Looking at the latest releases I don&#x27;t see any sbrk or brk usage in OpenBSD&#x27;s malloc or Google&#x27;s tcmalloc, and jemalloc&#x27;s documentation says that sbrk is by default only a fallback for when mmap fails.<br>
<p>
I think glibc&#x27;s malloc is one of the few implementations that still use sbrk these days, and only because some people freak out when performance characteristics change too drastically, which is kind of ironic because I think even macOS and Windows have completely revamped their heap implementations in the past decade.<br>

      The only compelling modern uses for sbrk(2) I'm aware of are:
<ul>
  <li>Virtual address space for 32-bit systems is a very limited resource, so it's important to consume any address space dedicated to sbrk before giving up in malloc(3).</li>
  <li>Jump/load addresses in (at least) x86_64 machine code can be more densely encoded if in the bottom 4 GiB of virtual address space, which is where sbrk allocates. <a href="https://hhvm.com/">hhvm</a> takes advantage of this for JIT-compiled machine code and related data structures, which was the motivation for allowing the application to control <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>'s preference for mmap(2) versus sbrk.</li>
</ul>

To me, apps allocate memory from the heap by calling malloc(). Malloc is often implemented by calling mmap(). Therefore anon mmaps are part of the heap. The fact that the heap used to be extended by calling brk() is an implementation detail.<br>

If I had my way, I&#x27;d just kill brk() entirely. There&#x27;s no longer any reason whatsoever to use brk() instead of mmap().<br>

Use of mmap is actually documented in malloc(3), but it is described as a glibc-specific performance optimization for large allocations, rather than the preferred or standard way of doing things (which is strongly implied to be brk/sbrk).<br>

So, I&#x27;m a bit confused about the implications here... If changes in userspace are needed anyway, since it&#x27;s necessary to call `prctl()` at some point after an allocation is made now, couldn&#x27;t all this tracking be done *only* in userspace? What advantages does involving the kernel really bring here?<br>

      The kernel knows which pages are actually resident — and puts that information in the same files where the new name shows up.

As I&#x27;m not a core kernel developper, I&#x27;m going to assume the candid role.<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s been said that *processes* owning VMA should be tracked for optimization. Why isn&#x27;t their PID the prefered choice for assigning a &quot;name&quot; to these VMA ?<br>

      I can imagine a lot of reasons for not using PIDs, starting with the fact that a single process can have a lot of VMAs that should be tracked separately.  PIDs are namespace-specific.  And you already know the PID of interest anyway since you're getting this information out of the process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory.

Thanks :)<br>
<p>
This would have deserved a more detailed explanation. As I now understand, what was needed is for the VMAs wasn&#x27;t to be tracked by their owners (if it makes sense to say that) but by their &quot;class&quot; (for lack of another name), with the goal to &quot;optimize memory usage&quot;. So it&#x27;s another way of grouping VMAs just for analysis, maybe across several processes.<br>

VMAs can be shared between processes across a fork() so an anonymous memory page isn't necessarily specific to one PID.<br>

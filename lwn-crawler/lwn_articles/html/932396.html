</div>
The "vmap area" is a range of kernel address space used when the kernel
needs to virtually map a range of memory; among other things, memory
allocations obtained from <tt>vmalloc()</tt> and loadable modules are
placed there.  At the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Uladzislau Rezki,
presenting remotely, 
explained a performance problem related to the vmap area and discussed
possible solutions.
<p>
The problem, he said, is that the vmap area is protected by three global
spinlocks.  The global free-space area is covered by
<tt>free_vmap_area_lock</tt>, the tracking of mapped areas by
<tt>vmap_area_lock</tt>, and the list of lazily freed areas by
<tt>purge_vmap_area_lock</tt>.  These locks, he said, can turn into a
significant bottleneck on systems with a large number of CPUs.  The
<tt>vmap_area_lock</tt> controls access to a <a
href="/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a> that can be used to find an
allocated area using an address within it.  These areas can be seen by
looking at <tt>/proc/vmallocinfo</tt>.  The <tt>free_vmap_area_lock</tt>,
instead, regulates access to free space and can experience high lock
contention.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/932400/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/UladzislauRezki-sm.png" alt="[Uladzislau
Rezki]" title="Uladzislau Rezki" class="rthumb"></a>

The allocation path has to acquire both <tt>free_vmap_area_lock</tt> (to
find a free range) and <tt>vmap_area_lock</tt> (to mark that range as
busy).  The freeing path, instead, needs <tt>vmap_area_lock</tt> and
<tt>purge_vmap_area_lock</tt>.  This pattern means that the three areas
cannot be accessed concurrently.  Running some tests on a "super-powerful
computer", Rezki measured a basic <tt>vmalloc()</tt> call as taking about
2µs when a single thread was running.  With 32&nbsp;threads calling
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> 
simultaneously, that time grew to 50µs — 25&nbsp;times greater.  That
slowdown is the result of contention on the vmap-area locks.
<p>
The biggest problem, he said, is <tt>vmap_area_lock</tt>.  This is partly
due to a fair amount of fragmentation in the allocated areas, he said; the
free and purge lists have fewer, larger areas and, as a result, less
contention.  Rezki proposed addressing this problem by adding a per-CPU cache;
each CPU would pre-fetch some address space into its cache, then allocate
pieces of that space to satisfy requests.
<p>
An attendee pointed out that the problem of allocating vmap-area space
looks similar to allocating user-space address space and asked whether the same
infrastructure could be used for both.  Rezki answered that user-space
allocation is a bigger problem, so the solution is heavier, and optimized
implementations are still in development.  The real problem with the vmap
area is the serialization of requests across CPUs, which is amenable to a
simpler solution.
<p>
Liam Howlett said that the <tt>vmap_area_lock</tt> is used for both
allocation and freeing operations; if it could be avoided in one of the two
paths, that could reduce contention.  Rezki said that is true in theory,
but that the bookkeeping has to be done somehow regardless.  Howlett
repeated that the problem is similar to the allocation of virtual-memory
areas for user space.  Memory-management developers should learn from each
other, he said, rather than going off and doing their own things.
<p>
Rezki moved on to the management of free space in the vmap area.  When a
range in that area is freed, the approach would be to convert the address
into the appropriate per-CPU zone, lock that zone, and remove the
allocation.  Then the lazy-free zone could be locked, and the newly freed
area added there.  A separate context would occasionally drain that lazy
list; in his patch set it is being drained to the global area for now.
<p>
He concluded by asking what his next steps should be; the answer was to
post patches and follow the usual process.  He was asked for performance
numbers, but had none available.  When asked where this contention has been
observed, he said it shows up on Android systems during video playback.
The session ended with Michal Hocko suggesting that Rezki join his work
with the efforts to improve user-space address allocation if possible.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

We hit this bottleneck hard. Our service involves a large number of incoming SSH connections. The bottleneck happens in two places: a) per-process kernel stack (if VMAP_STACK is enabled) allocation and b) pty (always allocated through vmalloc) allocation. In the end we rewrote a suitable SSH backend, instead of using OpenSSH.<br>

So yeah if this is for video playback only, that's a userspace/driver issue, not a vmap issue. Of all gpu workloads video codec really should be the most predictable, allocate all buffers you need upfront and then recycle. If there's enough reallocations during playback to matter something is really busted.<br>

To me it seems like video playback is an example, not the only case at all.<br>
<p>
Regarding video playback, can you tell what happens during streaming when bitrate changes and so forth? To me there is plenty of variation that needs to be accounted for..<br>

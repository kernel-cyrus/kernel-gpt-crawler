           </div>
A longtime aspect of the kernel's memory-management subsystem is that it
tends to fragment memory over time.  After a system has been running for
a while, finding groups of physically contiguous pages can be difficult;
that is why kernel code will often go to great lengths to avoid the need
for contiguous blocks of pages.  But there are times when larger blocks
are needed; among other things, the <a href="/Articles/423584/">transparent
huge pages feature</a> requires them.  Memory can be defragmented on the
fly with the kernel's <a href="/Articles/368869/">memory-compaction
mechanism</a>, but compaction is easily thwarted by kernel-allocated pages
that cannot be moved out of the way.
<p>
User-space pages are easily migrated; they are accessed via the page
tables, so relocating a page is just a matter of changing the appropriate
page-table entries.  Pages in the system's page cache are also accessed via
a lookup, so they can be migrated as well.  Pages allocated by a random
kernel subsystem or driver, though, are not so easy to move.  They are
accessed directly using kernel-space pointers and cannot be moved without
changing all of those pointers.  Because kernel pages are so hard to move,
the memory-management subsystem tries to separate them from pages that can
be moved, but that separation can be hard to maintain, especially when
memory is in short supply in general.  A single unmovable page can foil
compaction for a large block of memory.
<p>
Solving this problem in any given subsystem will require getting that
subsystem's cooperation in the compaction process; that is just what <a
href="/Articles/650864/">Gioh Kim's driver-page migration patch series</a>
sets out to do.  It builds on some special-case code (introduced in 2012)
that makes balloon-driver pages movable; the patches generalize that code
so that it may be used in other subsystems as well.
<p>
To make a driver (or other kernel subsystem) support page migration (and,
thus, compaction), the first step is to allocate an anonymous inode to
represent those pages:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/anon_inodes.h&gt;
    
    struct inode *anon_inode_new(void);
</pre>
<p>
The only real purpose of this inode appears to be to hold a pointer to an
<tt>address_space_operations</tt> structure containing a few migration-related
callbacks.  The relevant methods are:
<p>
<pre>
    bool (*isolatepage) (struct page *page, isolate_mode_t mode);
    void (*putbackpage) (struct page *page);
    int (*migratepage) (struct address_space *space, struct page *page,
    			struct page *newpage, enum migrate_mode mode);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>migratepage()</tt> has been in the kernel (in various forms) since
2.6.16; the other two are new with Gioh's patch.  To support compaction of
its pages, a kernel subsystem should provide all three of these operations.
Once the anonymous inode has been allocated, its
<tt>i_mapping-&gt;a_ops</tt> field should be set to point to the
<tt>address_space_operations</tt> structure containing the above methods. 
<p>
Needless to say, only whole pages can be supported in the page-compaction
system; memory allocated from slab caches will remain immobile.  To make a
page movable by the compaction code, a kernel subsystem needs to
(1)&nbsp;mark the page as being "mobile" and (2)&nbsp;set its
<tt>mapping</tt> field to that of the anonymous inode:
<p>
<pre>
    __SetPageMobile(page);
    page-&gt;mapping = anon_inode-&gt;mapping;
</pre>
<p>
Once that is done, the kernel may consider that page for migration if it
turns out to be in the way.  The first step will be a call to
<tt>isolatepage()</tt> to disconnect any internal mappings and ensure that
the page can, indeed, be moved.  The <tt>mode</tt> argument doesn't appear
to be relevant for most code outside of the memory-management subsystem;
the function should return <tt>true</tt> if the page can be migrated.  Note
that it's not necessary to cease use of the page at this point, but it is
necessary to retain its ability to be moved.
<p>
The actual migration may or may not happen, depending on whether other
nearby pages turn out to be movable.  If it does happen, the
<tt>migratepage()</tt> callback will be invoked.  It should do whatever
work is needed to copy the page's contents, set the new page's flags
properly, and update any internal pointers to the new page.  It should also
perform whatever locking is needed to avoid concurrent access to the pages
while the migration is taking place.  The return code should be
<tt>MIGRATEPAGE_SUCCESS</tt> if the operation worked, or a negative error
code otherwise.  If the migration succeeds, the old page should not be
touched again after <tt>migratepage()</tt> returns.
<p>
The final step is a call to <tt>putbackpage()</tt>; its job is to replace
the page in any internal lists and generally complete the migration
process.  If <tt>isolatepage()</tt> has been called on a given page, there
will eventually be a <tt>putbackpage()</tt> call, regardless of whether the
page is actually migrated in between the two calls.
<p>
As can be seen, there is a fair amount of work required to support
compaction in an arbitrary kernel subsystem.  As a result, this support is
likely to be confined to a relatively small number of subsystems that use
substantial amounts of memory.  Gioh's patch adapts the balloon driver
subsystem in this way; on systems employing virtualization, balloon devices
can (by their nature) use large amounts of memory, so making it movable
makes some sense.  Other possible use cases include long-lived I/O buffers
or drivers (such as graphics drivers) that need to store large amounts of
data.  Fixing just a few of these drivers should go a long way toward
making more large, physically contiguous regions of memory available even after the
system has been up for some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

A stupid question: why not instead allocate immovable pages with preference for (hugepage grain &amp; alignment) ranges that're guaranteed to already have an immovable page in them, thus only frustrating compaction to a reasonably minimized degree? This ought to work well because by definition every non-immovable page in such a range is free, movable, or discardable, so gaps appear at deallocation only.<br>
<p>
(it's stupid because I'm assuming that status quo scatters immovable allocs around physical memory the same as e.g. anon memory for userspace.)<br>
<p>
Upsides: no coöperation from allocators of immovable RAM. Impl is likely small, centralized, and applies to all consumers of immovable pages. Copies to relocate at alloc rather than at compact. Downsides: immovable memory remains immovable, so large allocations of immovable pages can't move shrapnel out of the way.<br>

What you are suggesting does exist, and is called "grouping pages by mobility". Hugepage-large blocks of memory are marked with a "migratetype" as  movable, unmovable, or reclaimable (for slab caches where freeing can be requested). All allocations declare their migratetype and the allocator tries to find free page in the matching block first.<br>
<p>
But it's not a silver bullet. It works perfectly until free memory is exhausted and then you eventually find out that e.g. an unmovable allocation doesn't fit in any of the pageblocks marked as unmovable, and the allocation has to "fallback" to one of the partially free movable blocks. There are heuristic to select the fallback blocks that will result in lowest possible permanent damage - i.e. select a movable block that has the most free pages, and mark it as unmovable, so if there are more unmovable allocation requests, they can be satisfied from the same block, and not pollute another one.<br>
<p>
Still it's just heuristics and can't be perfect without being able to predict the future. Consider an extreme case of your "gaps appear at deallocation only" scenario. There might be a surge of unmovable allocations that will occupy nearly the whole memory for a while, and then every odd page will be freed. The remaining even pages will now occupy half memory, but spread evenly in all pageblocks. If we knew at the allocation time that the even pages would be long-lived and the odd ones not, we could group them together. But we can't know that...<br>

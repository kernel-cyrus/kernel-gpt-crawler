<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 12, 2024</br>
           </div>
The release of the <a
href="/ml/all/2024120520-mashing-facing-6776@gregkh/">4.19.325 stable
kernel update</a> on December&nbsp;5 marked the end of an era of sorts.
This kernel had been supported for just over six years since <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181022073224.GA5658@kroah.com/">its initial
release</a> in October 2018; over that time, 325 updates were released,
adding 30,109 fixes.  Few Linux kernels receive public support for so long;
it is worth taking a look at this kernel's history to see how it played
out.
<p>
The 4.19 release is unique in that it was made in <a
href="/Articles/765108/">a time of uncertainty</a> in the Linux community;
Linus Torvalds had taken a break from his role to rethink how he worked
within the community.  Meanwhile, developers were working to adopt and
understand the kernel's new code of conduct. That uncertainly is nearly
forgotten now, though; the pace of development never slowed, and the new
normal (quite similar to the old normal) was quickly established.  But 4.19
remains special as the only mainline release that was not made by Torvalds.

<p>

<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
<h4>Where the work came from</h4>
<p>
Over the six years of its support, 4.19.x incorporated fixes from 4,898
individual developers.  By comparison, the mainline kernel has received
over 487,000 commits from 13,578 developers during this time period.  In
other words, just over 6% of the commits going into the mainline kernel
were backported to 4.19.x; just over a third of the developers contributing
to the mainline saw their work backported into this stable series.  The
most active contributors to the 4.19.x stable series were:

<p>
It should be noted that, of Greg Kroah-Hartman's patches, 325 were simply
setting the version number for each release; without those, he would still
be on the above list, but toward the bottom.  Over half (217) of the fixes
contributed by Eric Dumazet were reported by the syzbot fuzz-testing
system, which has proved to be a potent bug-finding tool.
<p>
Indeed, syzbot is responsible for a large share  (17%) of the 5,155 fixes
that carried Reported-by tags:

<p>
The fact that only 17% of the commits in this stable series have
Reported-by tags (when all of the commits are meant to be bug fixes)
suggests that many bug reporters may still be going uncredited.  That
percentage is higher than a typical mainline release, though, where about
6% of the commits have Reported-by tags.

The list of companies supporting this work differs a bit from the <a
href="/Articles/767635/">companies that contributed to 4.19</a>, or to <a
href="/Articles/997959/">more recent kernels</a>.  The percentage of
unknown and volunteer contributors is somewhat higher, and the companies
with the highest contribution rates are, unsurprisingly, mostly in the
business of supporting older kernels for relatively long periods of time.
Red Hat may take some criticism for how it manages its enterprise kernels,
but it is clearly doing a lot of work that helps the mainline stable
kernels as well.
<p>
<h4>Backporting</h4>
<p>
While writing the patches behind all of these fixes is a big part of the
work going into a stable kernel update, there is more to it than that.
Somebody must identify the patches as stable material and backport them — a
task that can be as simple as a <tt>git cherry-pick</tt> command or as
complex as completely rewriting the patch.  Backporting a patch is
essentially a new application of the patch, so it requires a new
Signed-off-by line.  Thus, by comparing the signoffs in a backported
patch to those in the original, we can identify who did that work.
<p>
Of the 30,109 patches applied to 4.19.x, 29,534 contained references to the
originally applied mainline patch.  Looking at those commits,
243&nbsp;developers were identified as having performed stable backporting,
but that work was not evenly spread out.  The most active backporters were:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th colspan=3>Top 4.19.x backporters</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Sasha Levin</td><td align="right">16,319</td><td align="right">55.25%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Greg Kroah-Hartman</td><td align="right">12,122</td><td align="right">41.04%</td></tr>

<p>
While Sasha Levin and Kroah-Hartman clearly did the bulk of the backporting
work — nearly 13 commits for every one of the 2,236 days of the 4.19.x
series between them — it's worth noting that other developers usually only
get involved in the backporting work when the backport itself is not
trivial.  So there may have been a fair amount of work involved to get
those commits into a stable update.

Still, it is hard not to think, when looking at those numbers, that the
important task of creating these stable updates falls too heavily on too
few developers.
<p>
<h4>Where the bugs came from</h4>
<p>
Finally, we can also have a look at when the bugs fixed in 4.19.x were
introduced.  Just over 16,000 of the commits in 4.19.x contained Fixes tags
indicating the commit that introduced a bug; with a bit of CPU time,
those tags can be turned into a histogram of which release introduced each
bug fixed in this stable series:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/v4.19-pre.png" alt="[Histogram of bug-introducing
releases]" width=631 height=1227>
</blockquote>
<p>
As shown above, just over 1,000 of the bugs fixed in 4.19.x were introduced
in 4.19 itself.  After that, there is a long tail of bugs that covers every
release in the Git history.  There are 367 bugs attributed to 2.6.12, all
of which predate the Git era entirely.  It remains true that bugs can lurk
in the kernel for a long time before somebody finds and fixes them.
<p>
The above is not the full story, though; there are still about 2,000 fixes
missing.  They appear, instead, in this plot:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/v4.19-post.png" alt="[Histogram of bug-introducing
releases]" width=614 height=529>
</blockquote>
<p>
This plot shows all of the bugs that were fixed in 4.19.x that were
introduced in commits added to the mainline <i>after</i> the 4.19 release.
Each of these, in other words, is a bug that was introduced into the stable
series by way of a backported patch.  While it appears that 4.20 was the
biggest source of backported bugs and things have gotten better since, the
real situation is almost certainly a bit less optimistic.  As we have seen,
bugs take time to show up and be fixed; if the maintenance of 4.19 were to
continue, the plot would probably flatten out.  The white
space is likely just representing bugs that have not yet been fixed.  As
Kroah-Hartman noted in the 4.19.325 release announcement, there are
currently 983&nbsp;known bugs with CVE numbers that are unfixed in this
kernel.
<p>
It is worth noting that the above picture is still incomplete, since only a
little over half (53%) of the patches going into 4.19.x carried Fixes tags.
That is a lot of commits, in a series that is supposed to be dedicated to
fixes, that lack that documentation.  There will be a number of reasons for
that, starting with the fact that, sometimes, developers simply do not take
the time to track down the commit that introduced a bug they are fixing.
But there is also a steady stream of changes for which a Fixes tag is not
appropriate; these include new device IDs, documentation improvements, and
a lot of fixes for hardware vulnerabilities.
<p>
As Kroah-Hartman said in the 4.19.325 release: "<q>it had a good life,
despite being born out of internal strife</q>".  
This kernel found its way into many distributions, and onto a massive
number of Android devices.  In a real sense, the stable kernels are the
real end product from the kernel development community, and this one,
despite the large number of updates, has stood up well.  The time has come
to say a final goodbye to this kernel — and to ensure that all remaining
systems have been upgraded to something that is still supported.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Note that the figures from the last graph are a bit skewed, as known-buggy fixes are backported deliberately, together with their reverts and fixes.<br>

      True.  When I've looked at the introduction of regressions into the stable kernels, I've deliberately left out those that were introduced and fixed in the same stable update, and were thus never exposed to users.  The graph here does not have that filter applied to it.  It would be an interesting exercise to see how big a difference that makes, though; hopefully there aren't <i>that</i> many buggy fixes...

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 19, 2009</br>
           </div>
The proposed <tt>reflink()</tt> system call creates an interesting cross
between a hard link and a file copy.  The end result of a successful
<tt>reflink()</tt> call is a new, distinct file - with its own inode -
which shares data blocks with the original file.  A copy-on-write policy is
used, so the two files remain distinct; if one is modified, the changes
will not be visible in the other.  This call has a number of uses,
including fast snapshotting and as a sort of optimized copy operation.
But, as was described <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/331808/">in the
previous article on <tt>reflink()</tt></a>, there is some disagreement over
how file ownership and security-related metadata should be handled.  
<p>
It comes down to the different use cases for this system call.  In the
"snapshot" case, security information must be preserved; that, in turn,
means that <tt>reflink()</tt> can only be used by the owner of the file (or
by a process with sufficient capabilities to get around ownership
restrictions).  On the other hand, those wanting to use <tt>reflink()</tt>
as a fast file copy 
would rather see security information treated like it would be with a file
copy; the user creating the reflink must have read access to the original
file and ends up owning the new one.
<p>
For a while, it seemed like the reflink-as-copy use case was simply going
to be left out in the cold.  But then Joel Becker, the author of the
<tt>reflink()</tt> patches, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/333003/">proposed a compromise</a>.  If the
process calling <tt>reflink()</tt> had ownership or suitable privilege, the
snapshot semantics would prevail.  Otherwise, read access would be required
and a new set of security attributes would be applied.  The idea was to try
to automatically do the right thing in all situations.
<p>
In the end, though, this approach didn't fly either.  From <a
href="/Articles/333786/">Andy Lutomirski's objection</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There are plenty of syscalls that require some privilege and fail
	if the caller doesn't have it.  But I can think of only one syscall
	that does *something different* depending on who called it: setuid.
<p>
	Please search the web and marvel at the disasters caused by
	setuid's magical caller-dependent behavior (the sendmail bug is
	probably the most famous).  This proposal for reflink is just
	asking for bugs where an attacker gets some otherwise privileged
	program to call reflink but to somehow lack the privileges
	(CAP_CHOWN, selinux rights, or whatever) to copy security
	attributes, thus exposing a link with the wrong permissions.
</div>
<p>
Others agreed that automagically changing behavior depending on caller
privilege was not the best way to go.  So Joel went back to the drawing
board yet another time.

On May 15, he came back with <a href="/Articles/333789/">a new
proposal</a>.  The <tt>reflink()</tt> API would now look like:
<p>
<pre>
    int reflink(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath, int preserve);
</pre>
<p>
The new <tt>preserve</tt> parameter would be a set of flags allowing the
caller to specify which bits of security-oriented information are to be
preserved.  Anticipated values are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_OWNER</tt>: keep the ownership of the file the
     same.  The caller must either <i>be</i> the owner or have the
     <tt>CAP_CHOWN</tt> capability.
<p>
<li> <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_SECURITY</tt>: preserves the SELinux/SMACK/TOMOYO
     linux security state.  This flag is only valid if
     <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_OWNER</tt> is also provided.  In the absence of
     <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_SECURITY</tt>, the new link gets a brand-new security
     state, as if it were any other new file.
<p>
<li> <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_MODE</tt>: the discretionary access control
     permissions bits remain the same; requires ownership or
     <tt>CAP_FOWNER</tt>.
<p>
<li> <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_ACL</tt>: all access control lists are preserved.
     This only works if <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_MODE</tt> is specified.
</ul>
<p>
The API would also provide <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_NONE</tt> and
<tt>REFLINK_ATTR_ALL</tt>, with the obvious semantics.  Importantly, if the
caller lacks 
the requisite credentials to preserve the requested information, the call
will simply fail.  There will be no magically-changing semantics depending
on the caller's capabilities.
<p>
Joel also proposes some new flags to the <tt>ln</tt> command:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>-r</tt> requests that a reflink be made.
<li> <tt>-P</tt> says that the <tt>reflink()</tt> call should use
     <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_ALL</tt>
<li> <tt>-p</tt> (lower case) is like <tt>-P</tt>, except that it will 
     retry with <tt>REFLINK_ATTR_NONE</tt> if the first call fails.
</ul>
<p>
There were some question as to whether all the flags are necessary; perhaps
all that is really needed is "preserve all" or "preserve none."  But Joel
feels like one might as well add the flexibility, given that the argument
is being added to the API anyway, and there doesn't seem to be that much
strong sentiment to the contrary.  All told, the <tt>reflink()</tt> API
would appear to be stabilizing toward something that everybody can agree
on.  It's probably late for 2.6.31, but this new system call could conceivably be
ready for the 2.6.32 development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Why not put the ability to reflink on the "cp" command rather than "ln". It seems a better fit. cp could then use reflink. It would be nice if cp could do or not do all those permission things even when a real copy is made.<br>

Other than the name, if "reflink(..., REFLINK_ATTR_NONE)" does the equivalent <br>
as a standard unprivileged file copy, I think this is a great addition.<br>
<p>
I don't know why one would extend the "ln" command however, when the <br>
semantics of all modes of operation are essentially variations on "cp".  <br>
"reflink" really ought to be renamed accordingly for the same reason - from a <br>
user perspective there is no link of any kind - it is just a space and time <br>
efficient file copy.<br>
